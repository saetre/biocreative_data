Upon recognition, these receptors can either directly mediate microbial killing through mechanisms such as encapsulation and phagocytosis, or indirectly through the induction of intracellular signaling pathways that control transcription of effector genes &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040229-b001">1</xref>&#x02013; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040229-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;. Despite the exposure to a very broad range of pathogens, the insect innate immune system lacks the type and specificity of adaptive capacity and memory that are characteristics for the vertebrate immune system. However, several studies have indicated that the innate immune systems of invertebrates may have some type of memory and adaptive ability &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040229-b009">9</xref>&#x02013; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040229-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;. A certain degree of anti-pathogen defense specificity in insects is achieved through the differential activation of immune response pathways by pathogen class-specific PRRs &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040229-b004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040229-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d;. Disease-transmitting mosquitoes have to cope with a diverse range of potential pathogens due to their complex life cycle, diverse breeding habitats, and hematophagy. It is intriguing that the approximately 150 predicted PRR genes found in the <named-content content-type="genus-species">Anopheles gambiae</named-content> genome can cope with this broad microbial exposure &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040229-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;. The vertebrate immune surveillance system is capable of discriminating between a similarly broad microbial spectrum through a very large and diverse pattern recognition repertoire, which is provided by V(D)J recombination and somatic hyper-mutation of the antibody immunoglobulin (Ig) domains. Insects do not produce antibodies, but the <named-content content-type="genus-species">Drosophila melanogaster</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species">A. gambiae</named-content> genomes contain some 140&#x02013;150 Ig domain protein- encoding genes that have mostly been studied in the context of neuronal guidance and also recently for implication in immunity &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040229-b016">16</xref>&#x02013; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040229-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;. One of the <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. melanogaster</named-content> Ig gene superfamily members, Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule gene <italic>Dscam,</italic> can produce some 38,016 different alternative splice forms through alternative splicing of 95 variable exons &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040229-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;. Dscam is implicated in neuronal wiring through axon guidance, and alternative splicing enables <italic>Dscam</italic> to produce a broad repertoire of molecules containing variable Ig domain combinations with different specificities in recognition and binding. The significance of this diversity for Dscam function is not clear. In the <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. melanogaster</named-content> olfactory system, the diversity of Dscam has been proposed to provide a mechanism by which dendrites of the same neuron can avoid each other as they elaborate their receptive fields. This mechanism appears to depend on Dscam's capacity to engage in homophilic interactions and is likely to be independent of the actual Dscam sequence itself &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040229-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d;. The vertebrate <italic>Dscam</italic> has been linked to the Down syndrome, but either of the two human Dscam paralogs studied displays a significant degree of alternative splicing. The zebrafish Dscam was recently shown to be essential for cell migration. In the fruit fly, <italic>Dscam</italic> is highly expressed in cell types that play major roles in the fly's innate immune system and have no known functions in the nervous system, suggesting it may have multiple functions &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040229-b017">17</xref>&#x02013; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040229-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d;. A recent study has reported high levels of Dscam in the fruit fly haemolymph and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg002">S2</xref> cell-conditioned medium, and RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated depletion of Dscam was shown to impair the haemocyte's capacity of phagocytosing bacteria &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040229-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;. Here we present evidence of the function of the <named-content content-type="genus-species">A. gambiae</named-content> Dscam, AgDscam, as a versatile PRR, capable of producing pathogen-specific splice form repertoires upon immune challenge. </p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results/Discussion</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Genome Organization and Exon Sequence Divergence Patterns</title><p>Similarly to the <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. melanogaster</named-content> ortholog, <italic>AgDscam</italic> comprises three variable Ig domain exon cassettes, 4, 6, and 10, each consisting of 14, 30, and 38 alternatively spliced Ig domain exons, respectively ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040229-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). In theory, <italic>AgDscam</italic> can generate 31,920 alternative splice forms ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040229-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). The majority of the non-alternatively spliced exons are highly conserved between the <named-content content-type="genus-species">A. gambiae</named-content> and <italic>D. melanogaster Dscam,</italic> ranging from 70&#x00025;&#x02013;95&#x00025; at the amino acid level while the spliced Ig domain exons have only 30&#x00025;&#x02013;70&#x00025; homology ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040229-g001">Figure 1</xref>B) &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040229-b027">27</xref>&#x0005d;. This pattern suggests that the constitutive and alternative exons are under different functional constraints. Constitutive exons, such as the intracellular exons 16&#x02013;21, might be implicated in more conserved functions, such as the regulation of downstream signaling pathways that regulate the actin filament necessary for axon guidance and cell migration &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040229-b026">26</xref>&#x02013; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040229-b029">29</xref>&#x0005d;. In contrast, the selective pressure causing the high degree of Ig domain sequence divergence must relate to profound differences in the lifestyles and environmental exposure of the two insects. </p><p>The higher degree of conservation between exons of one species compared to exons between species has been suggested to reflect a functional constraint of maintaining the ability to engage in homophilic interactions. Similarly to the <italic>D. melanogaster Dscam,</italic> exons within each of the <italic>AgDscam</italic> exon cassettes are more similar than between exon cassettes, and proximal exons within each cassette are more conserved than distal exons ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040229-g001">Figures 1</xref>B and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg001">S1</xref>) &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040229-b027">27</xref>&#x0005d;. The differential sequence divergence pattern of <italic>Dscam'</italic>s spliced adhesive Ig domain exons and the non-spliced exons, between <named-content content-type="genus-species">A. gambiae</named-content> and <italic>D. melanogaster,</italic> resembles the sequence divergence patterns of their immune gene repertoires; adhesive PRRs have diverged significantly to cope with the different microbial exposures while components of the intracellular signaling pathways Toll and Imd are highly conserved &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040229-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;. </p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Infection-Responsive Alternative Splicing</title><p>Regulation of <named-content content-type="genus-species">A. gambiae</named-content> immune responses occurs to a significant degree at the transcriptional level &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040229-b028">28</xref>&#x0005d;. <italic>AgDscam</italic> was not responding to infection by an overall increase of its transcripts, but by profound changes of its variable exon representation through alternative splicing. Challenge of the haemocyte-like immune competent cell line Sua5B, with bacteria-, fungi-, and pathogen-associated surface molecules was followed by rapid and specific changes of exon usage in an acute phase response manner ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040229-g001">Figure 1</xref>C and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st001">Table S1</xref>) &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040229-b004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040229-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d;. Exposure to different elicitors elicited production of different splice form repertoires that are characterized by over- or under- representation of specific Ig domain exon-containing splice forms. Hence, challenge with different pathogens resulted in the production of AgDscam molecules with different adhesive characteristics and interaction specificity. For instance, challenge with <named-content content-type="genus-species">Escherichia coli</named-content> resulted in the predominant production of AgDscam splice forms containing exon 4.8, 4.3, and 4.14, as well as, but at a lower proportion, splice forms with exons 4.4 and 4.13. Challenge with <named-content content-type="genus-species">Staphylococcus aureus</named-content> induced transcription of <italic>AgDscam</italic> splice forms containing exon 4.1, 4.13, and 4.14, and to a lesser extent, of exons 4.10 and 4.12. Cells challenged with the two Gram-negative bacteria, <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>Pseudomona veronii,</italic> generated quite similar expression patterns that correlated by a coefficient of 0.80 (Pearson's <italic>r</italic> &#x0003d; 0.80, <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 14, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.0007). Exposure of cells to the bacterial surface molecules peptidoglycan (PG) (characteristic for Gram-positive bacteria) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (characteristic for Gram-negative bacteria) showed only some degree of correlation with the splice form repertoires that were induced by the Gram-positive <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> or Gram-negative <italic>E. coli,</italic> respectively. This may be attributed to the influence of other elicitors present on the bacterial surface and possibly also the common PG contaminants of LPS preparations &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040229-b031">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040229-b032">32</xref>&#x0005d;. The stronger induction of specific splice forms by these purified elicitors is most likely attributed to their relative higher concentration compared to cells challenged with bacteria. The complexity of pathogen-induced splice form repertoires could be fairly high considering the additional alternatively spliced Ig exon cassettes 6 and 10 that are not assayed in this study &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040229-b033">33</xref>&#x0005d;. Previous studies have shown an elicitor dosage dependence of immune gene regulation in an <named-content content-type="genus-species">A. gambiae</named-content> immune competence cell line; a challenge with a lower dose resulted in a smaller magnitude of regulation &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040229-b034">34</xref>&#x0005d;. Challenge of cells with a 10-fold lower dosage (10 <sup>6</sup> colony-forming units (CFU)/10 <sup>6</sup> cells) of <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> resulted in a similar but less intense differential splicing pattern (correlation between two dosage treatments were: Pearson's <italic>r</italic> &#x0003d; 0.55, <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 14, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.0409) ( <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg002">Figure S2</xref>). The infection-responsive splice patterns are persisting up to at least 18 h after <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> or <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> challenge (later time points were not assays) (correlation of splicing regulation between 12- and 18-h time points were: <italic>E. coli:</italic> Pearson's <italic>r</italic> &#x0003d; 0.61, <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 14, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.0209; <italic>S. aureus:</italic> Pearson's <italic>r</italic> &#x0003d; 0.83, <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 14, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.0003) ( <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg002">Figure S2</xref>). </p><p>Bacteria challenge also triggered alternative splicing of <italic>AgDscam</italic> in the adult mosquitoes (data shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg002">Figure S2</xref>). However, the diverse expression of different <italic>Dscam</italic> splice forms in different tissues and cell types renders the definition of a specific immune challenge-induced splice form repertoire complicated in a complex sample as the whole insect. Different tissues and cell types may differ in their immune gene regulation upon challenge with the same elicitor, and <italic>AgDscam</italic> may in some cell types respond to challenge in a non-immunity&#x02013;related context &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040229-b018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040229-b022">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040229-b035">35</xref>&#x0005d;. The correlation of expression pattern in cell lines and adult mosquitoes upon <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content> challenge was quite significant (Pearson's <italic>r</italic> &#x0003d; 0.73, <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 14, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.003), but not for <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> challenge (Pearson's <italic>r</italic> &#x0003d; 0.4166, <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 14, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.1384). Upon <italic>Plasmodium</italic> invasion of the midgut epithelium, the <italic>AgDscam</italic> gene responded by changing its transcript exon repertoires in that tissue ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040229-g001">Figure 1</xref>C). <italic>AgDscam</italic> regulation in the <italic>Plasmodium</italic>-infected midgut may reflect both immune response to the parasite and the profound midgut epithelial cell reorganizations taking place during the expulsion of parasite-invaded apoptotic cells &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040229-b036">36</xref>&#x0005d;.

Indeed, the affinity of immune challenge-responsive <italic>AgDscam</italic> splice forms to microbes correlated with their induction specificity; infection-responsive regulation of <italic>AgDscam</italic> splicing resulted in the production of receptor molecules that had increased affinity to the infectious organism ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040229-g005">Figure 5</xref>A).

The specificity of splice form repertoires' affinity to the different bacteria is obviously not comparable to that of antibodies, suggesting that even non-infection-responsive splice forms can associate with pathogens but at a lower affinity. This was also indicated by the degree of antimicrobial activity specificity for different splice form repertoires (discussed below).

The fold change of the expression is presented as the percentage (&#x00025;) change compared to the <italic>dsGFP</italic>-treated control samples. cDNA template amounts from the different samples were normalized through amplification of an <named-content content-type="genus-species">A. gambiae</named-content> ribosomal S7 gene fragment as previously described &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040229-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d;. Standard error bars from the three replica assays are presented. </p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pbio.0040229.g005"/></fig></sec><fn-group><fn id="n1" fn-type="con"><p><bold>Author contributions.</bold> YD, HET, and GD conceived and designed the experiments.
