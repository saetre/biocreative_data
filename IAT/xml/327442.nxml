RNA isolated from nucleated red cells from this patient can be translated in vitro to give detectable levels of A gamma- G gamma and alpha-globin, but no beta-globin. S1-mapping transcription studies show that beta-globin mRNA is present at about 1-3% of the level of alpha- and gamma-globin mRNA. In addition, the expression of this gene has been studied by reversed genetics. SV40-plasmid-beta o-globin gene recombinants have been transfected into Hela cells and analysed for beta-globin mRNA. In contrast to the results obtained with mRNA isolated directly from the blood of this patient, in the transfected Hela cells the same level of beta-globin mRNA is seen for the beta o thalassaemic globin gene and for a normal beta-globin gene. To elucidate the nature of the lesion, the entire DNA sequence of the beta-globin gene of this patient has been determined. The sequence shows that this gene contains a termination codon at position 39 (CAG - greater than UAG). Otherwise, there is a remarkable conservation of the entire DNA sequence.</p><sec sec-type="scanned-figures"><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00410-0187-a" xlink:role="4395"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00410-0190-a" xlink:role="4398"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00410-0183.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4391"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00410-0184.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4392"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00410-0185.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4393"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00410-0186.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4394"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00410-0187.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4395"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00410-0188.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4396"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00410-0189.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4397"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00410-0190.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4398"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00410-0191.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4399"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00410-0192.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4400"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00410-0193.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4401"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
