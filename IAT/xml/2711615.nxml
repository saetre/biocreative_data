Here, we identify a novel mitochondria protein, hypoxia up-regulated mitochondrial movement regulator (HUMMR), which is expressed in neurons and is markedly induced by hypoxia-inducible factor 1 &#x003b1; (HIF-1&#x003b1;). Interestingly, HUMMR interacts with Miro-1 and Miro-2, mitochondrial proteins that are critical for mediating mitochondrial transport. Interestingly, knockdown of HUMMR or HIF-1 function in neurons exposed to hypoxia markedly reduces mitochondrial content in axons. Because mitochondrial transport and distribution are inextricably linked, the impact of reduced HUMMR function on the direction of mitochondrial transport was also explored. Loss of HUMMR function in hypoxia diminished the percentage of motile mitochondria moving in the anterograde direction and enhanced the percentage moving in the retrograde direction. Thus, HUMMR, a novel mitochondrial protein induced by HIF-1 and hypoxia, biases mitochondria transport in the anterograde direction. These findings have broad implications for maintenance of neuronal viability and function during physiological and pathological states.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Hypoxia is a potentially injurious stimulus that evokes molecular responses to enhance oxygen delivery and maintain energy supply. Hypoxia-inducible factor 1 &#x003b1; (HIF-1&#x003b1;), a master regulator of the cellular response to hypoxia, is a transcription factor stabilized and activated during hypoxia (for reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Semenza, 2000a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wenger, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kietzmann et al., 2001</xref>).

Two studies describe HIF-1&#x02013;dependent induction of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-1, which reduces mitochondrial oxygen consumption and reactive oxygen species production during hypoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kim et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Papandreou et al., 2006</xref>). In addition, HIF-1 also alters electron transport chain function by mediating switching of a subunit of complex IV, allowing the mitochondria to fine tune electron transport function during hypoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fukuda et al., 2007</xref>). Finally, HIF-1 activity suppresses mitochondrial DNA proliferation by suppression of c-Myc activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhang et al., 2007</xref>), and enhances mitochondrial autophagy by inducing the expression of bNip-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Semenza, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>In highly polarized cell types, such as neurons, transport of mitochondria is essential for maintenance of neuronal health and is maintained through the actions of multiple anterograde and retrograde protein motors and adapters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hollenbeck and Saxton, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Verstreken et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chang and Reynolds, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ly and Verstreken, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Frederick and Shaw, 2007</xref>). A protein conserved from yeast to mammals, Miro, is anchored in the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM), and is necessary for mitochondrial transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fransson et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Guo et al., 2005</xref>). <italic>Drosophila</italic> with loss of dMiro function display abnormal perinuclear clustering of mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Guo et al., 2005</xref>), as do yeast lacking Gem 1P (Miro orthologue; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Frederick et al., 2004</xref>). In addition, loss of dMiro function restricts mitochondrial transport and impairs synaptic function during trains of stimulation at the neuromuscular junction in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Guo et al., 2005</xref>). Milton binds to the dMiro and tethers the mitochondria to the kinesin heavy chain. The mammalian orthologues of Milton are GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor-interacting factor 1 (GRIF-1) and O-linked <italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosamine transferase-interacting protein (OIP106). Similar to dMiro, <italic>Drosophila</italic> with loss of Milton function have restricted mitochondrial transport and synaptic dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gorska-Andrzejak et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Glater et al., 2006</xref>). Recent studies suggests that Miro function and calcium-dependent control of mitochondrial transport is important for distributing mitochondria to the synapses and altering neuronal death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Macaskill et al., 2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wang and Schwarz, 2009</xref>). Therefore, Miro, Milton, and the kinesins are integral to maintenance of mitochondrial transport influencing synaptic function and neuronal health.</p><p>In this paper, we describe a mitochondrial protein involved in mitochondrial transport, which we rename hypoxia up-regulated mitochondrial movement regulator (HUMMR). In astrocytes, neurons, and whole brain, HUMMR abundance is low in normoxia, but it is markedly induced by hypoxia through a HIF-1&#x02013;dependent process. A prior study named this protein corneal endothelium-specific protein-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kinouchi et al., 2006</xref>), but did not describe its function. HUMMR specifically localizes to mitochondria and interacts with the Miros. Loss of HUMMR or HIF-1 function significantly reduces the number of mitochondria in the axon in neurons exposed to hypoxia. Interestingly, loss of HUMMR or HIF-1 function diminishes the percentage of motile mitochondria moving in the anterograde direction, but increases the percentage moving in the retrograde direction. Because HIF-1 is induced during hypoxia, ischemia, and Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease, these results have broad implications for mitochondrial transport and its resultant effects on synaptic and neuronal function during disease.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>HIF-1&#x003b1; induces a unique mitochondrial protein, HUMMR</title><p>Microarray technology (CodeLink) was used to search for HIF-1&#x02013;dependent targets.

Bas cells express HUMMR abundantly under normoxic conditions and were used to explore the submitochondrial localization of HUMMR. Because HUMMR has a TMD and interacts with Miro-1 and Miro-2, it is likely to have one of three topologies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 A</xref>): (1) TMD in the OMM with its C terminus in the cytoplasm, (2) TMD in the OMM with its C terminus in the IMS, or (3) TMD in the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) with the C terminus in the IMS and interacting with Miro through an undefined protein. To test if HUMMR is tethered to the OMM with its C terminus in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 A</xref>, 1), we exposed isolated mitochondria to trypsin. Unlike the OMM proteins Tom20 and Bcl-2, HUMMR was not degraded by trypsin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 B</xref>), which suggests that the C terminus is not in the cytoplasm. Exposure of mitochondria to hypo-osmolar solutions (osmotic shock) induces swelling and permeability of the OMM. Thus, cotreatment of mitochondria with osmotic shock and trypsin allows trypsin to have access to the IMS and degrades proteins in the IMS. Unlike cytochrome <italic>c</italic>, exposure to osmotic shock alone without trypsin did not alter HUMMR protein abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 C</xref>). Because osmotic shock alone did not reduce HUMMR, this finding suggests that HUMMR is not free to be released from the IMS, perhaps because its TMD is anchored to either the OMM or IMM. Yet, the combined treatment of osmotic shock and trypsin degraded HUMMR, which strongly suggests that HUMMR&#x02019;s C terminus is in the IMS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 C</xref>). Similar to the approach used for Bas cells, the topology of HUMMR was also examined in mitochondria isolated from hypoxic neurons (5% O<sub>2</sub> for 24 h). As in Bas cells, the C terminus of HUMMR was located in the IMS, but HUMMR was not released from the IMS with osmotic shock (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 D</xref>).</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p><bold>The C terminus of HUMMR is localized in the IMS.</bold> (A) Because HUMMR interacts with Miro-1 and Miro-2, it likely has one of three conformations: (1) TMD in the OMM with C terminus in cytoplasm, (2) TMD in OMM with C terminus in the IMS, or (3) TMD in the IMM with the C terminus in the IMS.

In contrast, if HUMMR is anchored in the IMM, then its C terminus (beyond the TMD) would likely interact either directly or indirectly with Miro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 A</xref>, 3). To examine this concept, multiple C-terminal truncation mutants were constructed of HUMMR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 A</xref>). When coexpressed with Miro-1 or Miro-2, all of the C-terminal truncation mutants coprecipitated with the Miros, which indicates that the majority of the C terminus beyond the TMD (177 of 219 amino acids) can be eliminated without interrupting HUMMR&#x02013;Miro interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 B</xref>). When larger truncations of the C terminus (&#x0003e;177 aa) were attempted, HUMMR expression was not observed. In contrast to the C terminus, if the N terminus (including TMD) of HUMMR is removed (&#x00394;N1-63-Flag), HUMMR no longer coprecipitates with the Miros. Similarly, when the TMD is removed from Miro-2 (Myc&#x02013;Miro-2&#x00394;TM), the interaction between HUMMR and Miro-2 is lost (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7, C and D</xref>). However, because &#x00394;N1-63-Flag HUMMR and Myc&#x02013;Miro-2&#x00394;TM do not traffic to the mitochondria, this is not definitive proof that the proteins are interacting through the N terminus.

When delivered by adenovirus to all neurons in culture, the shRNA markedly reduced hypoxia-induced HUMMR protein expression (Fig. S5 B). When neurons are transfected at the time of culture preparation, only 20&#x02013;30% of neurons are transfected. Despite this small percentage, a reduced abundance of HUMMR is still appreciated in these cultures on day in vitro (DIV) 7 (Fig. S5 C). Similarly, if HUMMR and shRNA are cotransfected into HEK-293 cells, the abundance of transfected HUMMR is diminished in cultures for at least 7 d after transfection (Fig. S5 D).</p><p>HUMMR interacts with proteins involved in mitochondrial transport, which are inextricably linked to mitochondrial distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Stowers et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Guo et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Russo et al., 2009</xref>).

The axons of neurons expressing shRNA (GFP) were identified and the mitochondria contained in the axons were identified (DsRed). The lengths of the mitochondria were measured, summed, and normalized to the length of the axon containing the mitochondria. This measure, termed the mitochondrial axonal index, was a measure of the amount of mitochondria per micrometer of axon, similar to other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Saotome et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">MacAskill et al., 2009a</xref>).

In this study, we describe another association between HIF-1 and mitochondria, the protein HUMMR (also known as corneal endothelial specific protein). HUMMR is induced by hypoxia through a HIF-1&#x02013;dependent mechanism and is expressed in neurons, astrocytes, and whole brain. Interestingly, HUMMR interacts with the proteins Miro-1 and Miro-2, and alters localization of GRIF-1, an orthologue of Milton. Loss of HUMMR or HIF-1 function decreased mitochondrial content in axons and reduced anterograde mitochondrial transport. These data strongly suggest that HUMMR is a HIF-1&#x02013;regulated mitochondrial protein that regulates mitochondrial transport and distribution.</p><p>Loss of function of Miro, Milton, or syntabulin, which are all involved in anterograde mitochondrial transport, reduces the mitochondrial number in the axon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Stowers et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cai et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Guo et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Russo et al., 2009</xref>). Similar to these proteins, reduced HUMMR function diminishes the number of mitochondria in the axon. This observation was apparent during normoxia, but was significantly greater after a 24 h exposure to 5% O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 E</xref>). When HUMMR function is compromised in hypoxia, anterograde mitochondrial movement is reduced, whereas retrograde mitochondrial transport is enhanced. Although a small trend toward reduced anterograde transport was observed in normoxia, this small change was not significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10 C</xref>). This finding, of course, calls into question why reduced HUMMR function would lessen axonal mitochondrial content in normoxia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8</xref>). The explanation may be due to methodology. It should be appreciated that the HUMMR-targeted shRNA is transfected into neurons at the time the neuronal cultures are prepared, whereas mitochondrial axonal content is not measured until DIV 7. Transfection of shRNA targeting HUMMR in cell lines reduced HUMMR protein for 7 d after transfection. As such, it would be expected that HUMMR function is diminished for multiple days before measuring axonal mitochondrial content on DIV 7. Thus, a small decrease in the probability of anterograde mitochondrial transport may be difficult to appreciate in a few minutes of time-lapsed images. Yet, if present, it may have a large impact on mitochondrial distribution over 7 d. Thus, our methodology for measuring movement may not be sensitive enough to find this modest change in normoxia. We cannot, however, exclude the possibility that HUMMR may have alternative effects on mitochondrial function that diminishes mitochondrial axonal content.</p><p>How might HUMMR influence the directional transport of mitochondria? Mitochondria are transported in the axon with periods of transport intermixed with pauses, and may display reversal of direction. As others have suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Frederick and Shaw, 2007</xref>), this directional movement could be achieved by varying motor recruitment, motor activity, or anchoring of mitochondria. Given that loss of HUMMR or HIF-1 did not alter the mean velocity of mitochondrial transport, a change in motor activity/kinetics is unlikely. Similarly, unlike proteins known to act as anchors for mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kang et al., 2008</xref>), loss of HUMMR or HIF-1 did not consistently change the percentage of motile mitochondria, although they both reduced the number of mitochondria in the axon, making a change in mitochondrial anchoring unlikely. In contrast, because HUMMR interacts with the Miro&#x02013;Milton protein complex and induces translocation of GRIF-1 from the cytoplasm to the mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>), it is plausible that HUMMR alters recruitment of GRIF-1 or OIP106 to the OMM, which enhances kinesin motor recruitment. This ability of HUMMR to increase GRIF-1 as part of the protein complex could increase the probability of anterograde movement. Recent work suggests that the GTPase domain of Miro-1 is particularly important for its ability to recruit GRIF-1 to the OMM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">MacAskill et al., 2009a</xref>). Thus, perhaps HUMMR alters Miro GTPase activity. Yet, a recent study demonstrates that Miro and kinesin heavy chain can directly interact without GRIF-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Macaskill et al., 2009b</xref>). Moreover, other proteins, including syntabulin and KIF-1&#x02013;binding protein, alter anterograde transport and localize to the mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cai et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wozniak et al., 2005</xref>). Putative interactions of HUMMR with these proteins are unexplored.</p><p>Given HUMMR&#x02019;s interaction with Miro&#x02013;Milton, which are directly involved in anterograde transport, it may be surprising that loss of HUMMR function also increased the probability of retrograde transport. It is worth noting that another protein, syntabulin, which influences anterograde movement of mitochondria, does not have this same effect on retrograde movement. When syntabulin function is inhibited, mitochondrial anterograde transport is diminished and the percentage of motile mitochondria declines, but retrograde transport is unchanged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cai et al., 2005</xref>). If loss of HUMMR function diminishes GRIF-1/OIP106 abundance on mitochondria, how would that increase retrograde transport? Perhaps simply reducing the number of anterograde motors attached to a given mitochondria increases the probability of the retrograde motor being engaged, but it is unclear how this would be mediated. Studies suggest that both anterograde and retrograde motors bind simultaneously to bidirectional cargos and coordinate movement rather than work in opposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Welte, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pilling et al., 2006</xref>). As such, it is likely that factors that activate anterograde motors also inactivate retrograde motors, and vice versa. Other studies demonstrate an involvement of Miro in anterograde and retrograde transport. For example, when Miro binds calcium, both anterograde and retrograde transport are inhibited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wang and Schwarz, 2009</xref>). Similarly, a recent study demonstrates a fundamental role for Miro in both anterograde and retrograde transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Russo et al., 2009</xref>). The coordination of directional movement is likely complex, as inhibition of the anterograde motor, kinesin 1, inhibits both anterograde and retrograde mitochondrial transport, perhaps suggesting that the kinesins can act as a direct activator of dynein in axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pilling et al., 2006</xref>). Although P150<sup>glued</sup>, a member of the dynactin protein complex, influences anterograde and retrograde mitochondrial transport, it is unlikely to coordinate directional changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pilling et al., 2006</xref>). It is still to be determined if HUMMR can interact with or influence the proteins mediating retrograde transport.</p><p>Regardless of the mechanism, if HUMMR maintains or enhances mitochondrial transport into axons during hypoxia, this could have important implications for neuronal function. Mitochondrial transport, or lack thereof, modulates synaptic function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hollenbeck and Saxton, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chang and Reynolds, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mattson, 2007</xref>). Loss of synaptic mitochondria at neuromuscular synapses in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, induced by loss of dMiro or Dlp1 function, leads to impaired synaptic physiology during prolonged stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Guo et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Verstreken et al., 2005</xref>). At the neuromuscular junction, loss of mitochondrial-generated ATP leads to diminished recruitment of a reserve pool of synaptic vesicles, which accounts for this loss of synaptic function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Verstreken et al., 2005</xref>). Loss of Milton function and mitochondrial transport also impairs synaptic activity of photoreceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Stowers et al., 2002</xref>). Recent work describes changes in short-term synaptic plasticity with loss of function of syntaphilin, a mitochondrial protein that anchors the mitochondria to axonal microtubules and inhibits transport of mitochondria out of the axon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kang et al., 2008</xref>). In fact, reduced mitochondrial content mediated by loss of syntaphilin function was of a similar magnitude as that induced by loss of HUMMR function. This observation suggests that loss of HUMMR function may similarly alter synaptic plasticity.</p><p>Because HUMMR protein abundance is enhanced by hypoxia and HIF-1, its influence on mitochondrial transport/distribution is likely to be most profound with hypoxia/ischemia exposure. It is tempting to speculate that HUMMR function may be particularly important in maintaining or enhancing anterograde mitochondrial transport after focal stroke or global ischemia. This property could maintain/support neuronal and synaptic plasticity, which is prominent in peristroke cortex in the days after ischemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carmichael, 2003</xref>). Interestingly, synaptic mitochondrial content increases in hippocampal dentate granule cells after transient global ischemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Briones et al., 2005</xref>), which suggests enhanced mitochondrial transport in a condition in which HIF-1 expression is enhanced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chavez and LaManna, 2002</xref>). In support of this idea, we found a modest increase in mitochondrial axonal content after 24 h of hypoxia exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8</xref>), which was abolished when HUMMR function was attenuated. Yet, the impact of hypoxia on mitochondrial transport is only beginning to be explored. A prior study used an acute (6 h) hypoxic (30&#x02013;40 mm Hg O<sub>2</sub>; &#x0223c;4&#x02013;6% O<sub>2</sub>) insult and observed reduced mitochondrial transport in neuronal processes through a nitric oxide&#x02013;mediated mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zanelli et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, the responses to hypoxia are likely complex, with diminished mitochondrial movement occuring acutely during hypoxia, which HUMMR expression may counterbalance to improve anterograde transport during longer periods of hypoxia. Beyond its role in hypoxia, HUMMR is present in the brain without exposure of mice to hypoxia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>). Moreover, HIF-1 protein abundance, and possibly HUMMR, is increased by stimuli other than hypoxia, such as growth factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Laughner et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chavez and LaManna, 2002</xref>), and in Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Soucek et al., 2003</xref>). Given that axonal mitochondrial movement is impaired in models of Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ebneth et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pigino et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chang et al., 2006b</xref>), enhanced HIF-1 function may help maintain anterograde mitochondrial transport during neurodegeneration.</p><p>As described in a previous study, HUMMR is abundant in some tissue, such as testes, ovary, and corneal epithelium in normoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kinouchi et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, HUMMR abundance is also regulated by HIF-1&#x02013;independent mechanisms that are operative under normoxic conditions. The high expression of HUMMR in testes and ovary is of interest because Milton-dependent mitochondrial transport in the oocyte is critical for proper inheritance of mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cox and Spradling, 2006</xref>). In sperm, loss of Milton function induces deficits in mitochondrial elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aldridge et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, HUMMR function may be critical for maintenance of reproductive function and distribution of mitochondria to the embryo.</p><p>In summary, we describe the novel finding of a hypoxia and HIF-1&#x02013;induced mitochondrial protein HUMMR. HUMMR interacts with the mitochondrial transportation molecular machinery, altering the distribution of mitochondria in the axon and modifying the percentage of mitochondria moving in the anterograde direction. These findings may have important consequences for neuronal survival and function.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Transgenic mice, cell culture, and hypoxic conditions</title><p>We used floxed HIF-1&#x003b1; (HIF-1&#x003b1;<sup>F/F</sup>) mice (a gift of R.
