A genetic analysis with a null mutant suggested a possible role for this protein in the events leading to viral egress. In this study, ORF45 was found to interact with KIF3A, a kinesin-2 motor protein that transports cargoes along microtubules to cell periphery in a yeast two-hybrid screen. The association was confirmed by both co-immunoprecipitation and immunoflorescence approaches in primary effusion lymphoma cells following virus reactivation. ORF45 principally mediated the docking of entire viral capsid-tegument complexes onto the cargo-binding domain of KIF3A. Microtubules served as the major highways for transportation of these complexes as evidenced by drastically reduced viral titers upon treatment of cells with a microtubule depolymerizer, nocodazole. Confocal microscopic images further revealed close association of viral particles with microtubules. Inhibition of KIF3A&#x02013;ORF45 interaction either by the use of a headless dominant negative (DN) mutant of KIF3A or through shRNA-mediated silencing of endogenous KIF3A expression noticeably decreased KSHV egress reflecting as appreciable reductions in the release of extracellular virions. Both these approaches, however, failed to impact HSV-1 egress, demonstrating the specificity of KIF3A in KSHV transportation. This study thus reports on transportation of KSHV viral complexes on microtubules by KIF3A, a kinesin motor thus far not implicated in virus transportation. All these findings shed light on the understudied but significant events in the KSHV life cycle, delineating a crucial role of a KSHV tegument protein in cellular transport of viral particles.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Kaposi's sarcoma&#x02013;associated herpesvirus (KSHV) is a tumor virus associated with Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) and a spectrum of other lymphomas. These tumor cells are usually latently infected with this virus. The inactive virus in cells can get reactivated, whereupon there is viral DNA replication and viral protein synthesis. Newly synthesized proteins assemble in an orderly fashion to form viral complexes that need to be transported to the cell periphery for release and to further infect fresh cells to maintain the infection. Events that make up this important phase in the viral life cycle, however, have been much less studied. In this study, we show that a KSHV protein called the open reading frame (ORF) 45 anchors newly assembled viruses onto a cellular motor protein, namely KIF3A. These viruses are then transported by KIF3A along microtubules which act as major cellular highways (tracks), allowing for efficient transportation of viral complexes toward the cell periphery. Inhibition of any of these steps resulted in a reduced transport of viral complexes reflecting as reduced viral levels. Thus, this study has helped to delineate crucial events involved in the transportation of newly assembled KSHV virions and provides for attractive viral and cellular targets that could be inhibited to reduce the virus burden.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="17"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Kaposi's sarcoma&#x02013;associated herpesvirus (KSHV), also known as the human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8), is a human DNA tumor virus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000332-Chang1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. KSHV is etiologically associated with the endothelial neoplasm Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) and with certain lymphoproliferative disorders like primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) and multicentric Castleman's disease (MCD) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000332-Cesarman1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000332-Soulier1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. KSHV infection of cells by default establishes latency. During this phase, there is expression of only a limited number of the viral (latent) genes essential for maintenance of the viral genome with no production of infectious virions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000332-Moore1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Disruption of latency results in the reactivation of the virus into the lytic phase, with expression of the entire viral gene panel and production of infectious viral particles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000332-Miller1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000332-Renne1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. These events thus ensure the propagation and transmission of viruses to uninfected cells serving to maintain the infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000332-Wang1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Lytic phase is also essential in sustaining the population of latently infected cells that otherwise would be quickly lost by segregation of latent viral episomes as spindle cells divide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000332-Grundhoff1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. The KSHV lytic phase and constant primary infection of fresh cells is thus crucial for both the viral tumorigenicity and the disease pathogenesis.</p><p>With the exception of viral DNA replication and viral gene expression, other events that follow viral reactivation including virus assembly, transportation and egress however have been much less studied in KSHV. To gain more knowledge about these events it thus becomes essential to identify the different virion proteins and recognize their functional roles. For this purpose, we purified extracellular KSHV virions from tetra deconyl phorbol acetate (TPA)-induced BCBL-1 cells (that are latently infected with KSHV) by double gradient ultracentrifugation and identified the component virion proteins by a mass spectrometric analysis. By this approach a total of 24 different virion-associated proteins were identified by a mass spectrometric analysis including five capsid proteins, eight envelope glycoproteins and eleven tegument or putative tegument proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000332-Zhu1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Among the different virion proteins, the tegument proteins in KSHV as well as in other related gamma herpesviruses have not been well studied. Current knowledge of these proteins comes mainly from studies on alpha and beta-herpesviruses wherein they contribute to three essential functions in the viral life cycle. First, some serve a regulatory function, modulating the host cellular environment during the immediate-early phase of infection like the virion host shutoff protein (UL41) of HSV-1 that degrades host mRNA and shuts down the host translation program <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000332-Smiley1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. Second, some play vital roles in transportation of capsids to the nucleus along microtubules following virus entry into the host cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000332-Luxton1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000332-Bearer1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Third, tegument proteins also participate in the complex chain of events involving herpesviral assembly and egress including transportation of viral complexes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000332-Mettenleiter1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000332-Mettenleiter2">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Based on these evidence, the need arises to investigate the functional roles if any of even the less studied KSHV tegument proteins.</p><p>One among these proteins in KSHV is ORF45, also recognized as an immediate-early (IE) protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000332-Zhu2">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000332-Zhu3">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. A vital role of ORF45 in events leading to viral egress following virus reactivation emanated from two observations. First, we had generated an ORF45-null recombinant KSHV using the bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) system by inserting a premature stop codon into the ORF45 coding sequence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000332-Zhu4">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Upon reconstitution into a 293T cell system followed by induction, this mutant produced a much lower yield of progeny virions compared to the wild-type virus though viral gene expression and DNA replication remained unaffected <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000332-Zhu4">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. This suggested that ORF45 could possibly have a role to play in the stages subsequent to viral DNA replication and viral protein synthesis, mostly involving transportation of viral complexes toward viral egress. The second supporting observation came from a yeast two hybrid (Y2H) screening employed to identify ORF45 interacting cellular partners that revealed ORF45 to interact with cDNAs of KIF3A (in this study).</p><p>KIF3A is a subunit of kinesin-2, a microtubule (MT) plus-end-directed motor protein. Kinesin-2 comprises two motor subunits, KIF3A and either KIF3B or KIF3C, and a non-motor subunit, KAP3 (kinesin superfamily-associated protein-3) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000332-Hirokawa1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000332-Kondo1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>.

KIF3A comprises of an N-terminal head (motor) domain that attaches to and migrates along MTs and a C-terminal tail that presumably functions as the cargo-binding domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000332-Yamazaki1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000332-Hasegawa1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In this study we thus explored the role and significance of ORF45&#x02013;KIF3A interaction in the possible transportation of KSHV viral complexes along microtubules toward egress following reactivation from latency. We found that ORF45 through its interaction with the cargo-binding domain of KIF3A docked the entire viral capsid-tegument complexes onto KIF3A which were subsequently transported along microtubules for viral maturation and egress. This to the best of our knowledge is the first report attributing a definitive role of KIF3A in virus transportation.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>ORF45 interacts with KIF3A</title><p>Earlier studies with an ORF45-null mutant virus revealed that disruption of ORF45 yielded 10-fold lowered titers of progeny virions as compared to the wild-type virus though viral gene expression and DNA replication remained unaffected <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000332-Zhu4">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. This finding suggested a role of ORF45 in virion assembly or egress. To further explore the function of ORF45 in these processes, we attempted to identify cellular proteins interacting with it. By an Y2H screening we identified interferon regulatory factor-7 (IRF-7) as an ORF45-associated protein with ORF45 antagonizing interferon- related anti-viral responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000332-Zhu5">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. Upon revisiting the Y2H results, another cellular protein was also identified as an ORF45-binding protein. This was KIF3A, a subunit of kinesin-2 and a microtubule (MT) plus-end-directed motor protein. KIF3A, a 702 amino acid protein contains three domains, head (motor), stalk and tail. Two prey plasmids isolated from the screening contained cDNAs for the C-terminal fragments of KIF3A with both fragments encompassing amino acids 409 to 702.</p><p>Interaction between ORF45 and KIF3A in cells was further confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) experiments. ORF45 and KIF3A expression vectors were used to co-transfect 293T cells. Forty-eight hours post-transfection, cells were lysed and immunoprecipitated with an anti-ORF45 antibody. By a Western blot, KIF3A was found to be immunoprecipitated with ORF45, suggesting that the two proteins are physically associated in a complex in cells (data not shown). The interaction of these two proteins was also examined in BCBL-1 cells latently infected with KSHV. Cell lysates prepared from TPA induced BCBL-1 cells and immunoprecipitated with a mouse monoclonal anti-ORF45 antibody revealed KIF3A in the immunoprecipitate detected with a rabbit anti-KIF3A antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000332-g001">Figure 1A, lane 3</xref>). As a control, KIF3A was not immunoprecipitated with mouse IgG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000332-g001">Figure 1A, lane 2</xref>). A reverse co-IP performed on cell lysates prepared from TPA-induced BCBL-1 cells with a rabbit-polyclonal anti-KIF3A antibody revealed immunoprecipitation of ORF45 with KIF3A (data not shown). This thus proved the interaction between these two proteins in the reverse direction, too.</p><fig id="ppat-1000332-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1000332.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Interaction of KSHV ORF45 with KIF3A.</title><p>(A) BCBL-1 cells induced with TPA for 48 hours were lysed, and whole cell extracts (WCE) were immunoprecipitated (IP) with mouse IgG (negative control) or mouse monoclonal anti-ORF45 antibody.

Both proteins were exclusively localized in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000332-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). The staining of ORF45 and KIF3A completely overlapped, again suggesting that these proteins are associated with each other in the cytoplasm of the cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Amino and carboxy termini of ORF45 interact with KIF3A</title><p>To further characterize the interaction between the two proteins, we attempted to map the domains of ORF45 interacting with KIF3A by Y2H and co-IP approaches.

The truncation/deletion mutants were introduced into 293T cells by transfection. KIF3A was not included in the transfection as it is ubiquitously expressed in all cells. Upon confirmation of optimal and stable expression of the full-length and the truncation mutants of ORF45 by a Western analysis, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag M2 affinity gel, followed by a Western blot with an anti-KIF3A antibody. KIF3A was immunoprecipitated with all the truncation mutants of ORF45 from the C-terminus (mutants 1&#x02013;115, 1&#x02013;237, 1&#x02013;332, 1&#x02013;383) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000332-g002">Figure 2A, right panel, lane 2, lanes 5&#x02013;7</xref>) though with reduced affinities compared to the full-length ORF45 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000332-g002">Figure 2A, right panel, lane 1</xref>).

However, the segment spanning amino acids 600&#x02013;702 (constituting the cargo-binding domain) interacted with ORF45. Additionally, deletions of the motor domain (segment 400&#x02013;702 with &#x00394; 1&#x02013;399) or the stalk (1&#x02013;702 with &#x00394; 400&#x02013;500 or &#x00394; 500&#x02013;600) did not block the affinity of KIF3A to ORF45. But absence of the cargo-binding domain (1&#x02013;600 with &#x00394; 601&#x02013;702) abolished the interaction of KIF3A with ORF45 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000332-g002">Figure 2B</xref>).

To validate the model, we asked if KIF3A associates with only ORF45 or with a whole capsid-tegument complex. We addressed this question by immunoprecipitating cell extracts obtained from TPA induced 293T cells harboring wild-type KSHV (BAC36) with an anti-KIF3A antibody. Upon analyzing the immunoprecipitates, we found that in addition to ORF45, other tegument proteins (ORFs 33 and 64) and capsid proteins (ORFs 62 and 65) were co-precipitated with KIF3A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000332-g003">Figure 3A, lane 4</xref>).

There were two possibilities (1) ORF45 could just be one among the many KSHV virion proteins interacting with KIF3A; (2) ORF45 probably mediates the association of viral complexes with KIF3A. Hence to delineate the role of ORF45 in this process, we performed a parallel immunoprecipitation assay on cell lysates collected from induced 293T cells carrying an ORF45-null mutant (BAC-stop45). In the absence of expression of ORF45 both the tegument and the capsid proteins failed to coprecipitate with KIF3A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000332-g003">Figure 3A, lane 6</xref>), providing a strong evidence that the viral capsid-tegument complexes docked onto KIF3A through ORF45. The lack of co-precipitation of tegument-capsid proteins with KIF3A in the ORF45-null mutant also could have been due to a defect in tegument-capsid complex assembly as a result of lack of functional ORF45 protein. To investigate this posibility, we also performed a co-IP with anti-ORF65 antibody with cell lysates from both BAC36 and BAC-stop45-carrying cells, followed by Western analyses with specific antibodies to some virion proteins. Intact viral capsid-tegument complexes as evidenced by presence of ORFs 65, 62, 33, and 64 were detectable in the immunoprecipitates obtained from both wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000332-g003">Figure 3B, lane 4</xref>) and the ORF45-null mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000332-g003">Figure 3B, lane 6</xref>) viruses.

Thus drug removal had resulted in MT repolymerization, resuming efficient transport of the viral complexes. To ensure that the decrease in viral titers was not due to nocodazole treatment irreversibly damaging the virion architecture or preventing viral tegument-capsid complex formation, nocodazole-treated and TPA-induced BCBL-1 cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-ORF65 antibody. In addition to ORF65, other capsid (ORF62) and tegument (ORFs 45, 64, and 33) proteins were detected in the immunoprecipitates by Western blot with specific antibodies, indicating the presence of intact tegument-capsid complexes in nocodazole-treated cells (data not shown).

There could be two possibilities for this scenario: (i) though greatly reduced by the DN mutant, some full-length KIF3A could still interact with ORF45 mediating viral transportation; (ii) other kinesin motors may also contribute to transportation of viral complexes. To address the first possibility, we attempted to knockdown KIF3A expression in cells through a short-hairpin RNA (shRNA)-based approach and examine its effect on KSHV transportation and hence egress. A Mission shRNA gene set against human KIF3A was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. The Mission shRNA system is a lentiviral vector based RNA interference library against annotated human genes, which generates siRNAs in cells and mediates gene specific RNA interference for extended periods of time. The KIF3A shRNA set consists of four individual shRNA lentiviral vectors against different target sites of KIF3A mRNA sequence (clone #1 was directed against the 3&#x02032; UTR and the clone #s 2&#x02013;4 targeting the coding sequence).

The evidences are (i) ORF45 specifically interacts with the cargo-binding domain of KIF3A and is colocalized with the cellular motor protein in the cytoplasm; (ii) Entire viral tegument-capsid complex was associated with KIF3A with ORF45 mediating the association; (iii) Intact microbutules were required for transport of viral complexes toward egress as demonstrated by nocadazole treatment and IFA; (iv) Disruption of KIF3A-ORF45 interaction with a headless DN mutant of KIF3A or through knockdown of endogenous KIF3A expression by siRNAs noticeably decreased KSHV egress reflected as appreciable reduction in the release of extracellular virions; (v) Knockdown of KHC expression had no appreciable effects on the viral egress demonstrating the specificity of KIF3A in KSHV transportation.</p><p>Based on these evidences a model for the role of ORF45 in virion maturation and egress has been presented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000332-g008">Figure 8</xref>). In this model, after nuclear egress, KSHV capsids acquire tegument proteins including ORF64, ORF63 and ORF45 in the cytoplasm. ORF45 on the capsid-tegument particles recruits KIF3A and mediates loading of the viral particles onto kinesin-2. Subsequently, viral particles are transported along microtubules in the cytoplasm from the perinuclear region to the cell periphery or trans-golgi network (TGN) membrane where envelopment and egress occur (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000332-g008">Figure 8</xref>). Transportation and acquirement of envelope glycoproteins is independent to that of the KIF3A transportation of viral tegument-capsid complexes as evidenced in our study wherein KIF3A failed to associate with glycoproteins (gB and gH). Similar findings have also been observed in HSV-1 where the anterograde transport of unenveloped capsids and the glycoproteins in axons involved dissociated pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000332-MirandaSaksena1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000332-Diefenbach1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000332-Diefenbach2">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000332-Holland1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><fig id="ppat-1000332-g008" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1000332.g008</object-id><label>Figure 8</label><caption><title>Model for transport of KSHV capsid-tegument complexes following viral reactivation.</title><p>Newly synthesized nucleocapsids exit out of the nuclear compartment wherein they acquire the tegument proteins including ORF45.

An earlier study from our laboratory revealed a role of ORF45 in antagonizing interferon antiviral defenses. KSHV ORF45 interacted with IRF-7 efficiently suppressing virus-mediated interferon (IFN) gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000332-Zhu5">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. But the ORF45 counterparts of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and Rhesus monkey Rhadinovirus (RRV) did not interact with IRF-7 (our unpublished data), suggesting that interaction with IRF-7 and inhibition of its activation is probably a function unique to KSHV ORF45. In contrast, KIF3A in addition to KSHV ORF45 also interacted with its analogues in EBV and RRV by both Y2H and co-IP (data not shown). The second function of ORF45 in virus transport through interaction with KIF3A could thus be uniformly conserved across all gamma herpesviruses.</p><p>An amino acid sequence alignment of ORF45 sequences from related gamma-herpesviruses performed with the ClustalW software (NCBI website) revealed a significant conservation of amino acids in the N-terminal and the C-terminal domains of the protein across the spectrum (data not shown). This observation further substantiated our ORF45 mapping data in KSHV wherein we detected only these highly conserved domains (amino acids 1&#x02013;115 and 332&#x02013;407; amino and carboxy terminals respectively) of ORF45 to interact with KIF3A, while the sparsely conserved middle domain (amino acids 115&#x02013;332) failed to associate with KIF3A.</p><p>The C-terminal region (spanning amino acids 600&#x02013;701) of KIF3A was found to interact with ORF45. This region has been predicted to be the possible cargo-binding domain of the protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000332-Yamazaki1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000332-Hasegawa1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. Similar interactions of viral proteins with the cargo-binding domain of other kinesins have also been reported in additional viruses including West-Nile virus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000332-Chu1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>, HIV-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000332-Tang1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref> and other herpesviruses like HSV-1. Interestingly in HSV-1, US11 tegument protein interacted with the heptad repeat cargo-binding domain of Kinesin-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000332-Diefenbach1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref> contributing to the anterograde transport of nucleocapsids along axons. Interactions of the cargo-binding domain of KIF3A with viral proteins have not been reported thus far. However other cargoes, like the PAR-3 protein (a protein complex functioning in various cell polarization events) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000332-Nishimura1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref> and GADD34 (possibly involved in transcription and DNA recombination) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000332-Hasegawa1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref> specifically interacted with the cargo-binding domain of KIF3A.</p><p>To assess if the KIF3A-ORF45 interaction is crucial for the virus in transportation toward viral egress, we further probed their interaction dynamics by two different approaches. The first approach involved the use of a DN mutant of KIF3A that lacks the motor domain but retains the cargo-binding domain. This mutant was seen to compete with full-length KIF3A in binding to ORF45 hence reducing the transport of viral complexes toward viral egress reflecting as a noticeable fall in virion release. Two valid observations arose from this approach: (i) KIF3A&#x02013;ORF45 interaction is of definitive significance in the transportation of KSHV viral capsid-tegument complexes; (ii) it demonstrates a potential value of the DN mutant in a peptide therapy to treat KSHV-associated diseases which could be further investigated.</p><p>With the DN mutant approach, we however did not notice a total abrogation of viral egress. This finding was expected, as the DN mutant can only competitively inhibit the full length KIF3A-ORF45 interaction and not totally abolish the interaction. We hypothesized that a much clearer picture on the contribution of KIF3A in transportation of viral complexes could only arise by approaches that tend to totally inhibit its interaction with ORF45. This was made possible by attempting to knockdown the endogenous KIF3A expression in BCBL-1 cells. A lentivirus based approach was employed to generate cells harboring the KIF3A shRNA sequences integrated into the host cell genome. This allowed for the stable and long-term gene down regulation, overcoming the difficulties associated with only a transient gene knockdown following direct transfection of small interfering RNA (siRNA). Stable knockdown of KIF3A expression manifested as a highly significant reduction in viral egress, more pronounced than that encountered with the DN approach.</p><p>Human kinesins constitute a large family of motor proteins with at least 14 members. Our data through gene knockdown studies suggest that kinesin-2 is a major vehicle for KSHV intracellular transport while kinesin-1 (KHC) is crucially responsible for HSV-1 transport. Although the likelihood of other kinesins contributing to KSHV and HSV-1 transport in minor roles cannot be ruled out, the fact that KSHV and HSV-1 egress was clearly not compensated by other kinesins during the shRNA knockdown of KIF3A and KHC respectively exemplifies the specificity of kinesin-2 in KSHV transport and KHC in HSV-1 movement along microtubules.</p><p>Though the observations seen with the shRNA mediated knockdown of KIF3A/KHC on KSHV egress, seem to be exciting, these however have to be interpreted cautiously. Down-regulation of the kinesins could possibly have other off-target effects on the viral or cellular components. This could be especially true given the fact that kinesins are involved in cellular processes. Possible deleterious effects on the viral processes associated with the knockdown were ruled out from the observation that the levels of viral DNA replication in cells expressing the KIF3A/KHC shRNAs were similar to that seen in cells expressing the negative control shRNA. More importantly, among the off-target effects on the cells likely to impact on KSHV egress, would be any effects on the microtubule structure. Earlier studies have shown that KIF3A knockdown in mammalian cells do not affect the microtubule architecture <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000332-Stauber1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus with levels of viral DNA replication and the microtubule architecture remaining unaffected, we could safely conclude that the initial steps in virus assembly remain unaffected by the knockdown. KIF3A down regulation has been shown to produce slightly aberrant Golgi complex morphology in mammalian cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000332-Stauber1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>. This is not likely to be the reason for a decrease in KSHV egress, as HSV-1 microtubule-dependent transport was not significantly affected.</p><p>The association of KIF3A with the viral capsid-tegument complexes was principally mediated by ORF45. Indeed, ORF45 was found to be tightly associated with the pelleted capsid complex when purified virions treated with detergents (Triton X-100 plus 0.5&#x00025; DOC) were subjected to high-speed centrifugation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000332-Zhu1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000332-Zhu3">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, the interactions of ORF45 with a multitude of tegument proteins including ORF64 and ORF63 and capsid proteins like ORF62 have been revealed in a virion-wide protein interaction study from our laboratory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000332-Rozen1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus ORF45 being associated tightly with the capsid-tegument complex is a probable component of the inner tegument acquired early following exit of capsids from the nuclear membrane hence is placed strategically to efficiently position the viral capsid-tegument complexes onto KIF3A. Further mapping studies by Y2H approaches, revealed that ORF45 interacted with other proteins like ORF64 and ORF 63 only through its middle segment (spanning amino acids 115&#x02013;332) (our unpublished data). This suggested that ORF45 could possibly have 2 distinct interacting domains; the amino and carboxy terminal ends that interact with KIF3A and the central domain interacting with the other virion proteins. This possibly ensures a more efficient binding of KIF3A to its binding sites on ORF45.</p><p>In related herpesviruses like HSV-1, recruitment of KHC by tegument proteins contributes to transportation of viral complexes toward viral egress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000332-Diefenbach1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000332-Diefenbach2">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000332-SatputeKrishnan1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. Contrastingly our study findings point out that KSHV recruits KIF3A (through ORF45) for transportation of viral capsid-tegument complexes. This finding seems highly intriguing, the most plausible explanation for the differences in the recruited kinesins could reside in the highly divergent tail (cargo-binding) domain of the kinesins that are known to specify distinct set of cargoes for each of them. Given the fact that ORF45, a protein with no homologs in alpha and beta- herpesviruses interacts with KIF3A, it is tempting to speculate that KIF3A might be uniquely adapted to mediate transportation of KSHV and other gamma-herpesviruses.</p><p>Two observations in our study substantiated the finding that microtubules serve as the major cellular highway for KIF3A to transport the viral capsid-tegument complexes. Treatment of BCBL-1 cells with a MT depolymerizer nocodazole <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000332-Damiani1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref> caused an appreciable decrease in virion production with drug removal replenishing the viral titer levels. Further confocal microscopic images revealed the association of viral particles with MTs following reactivation. Similar requirements of an intact microtubular structure for transport of virus complexes toward egress have been shown for other herpesviruses like HSV and PrV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000332-Luxton1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000332-Luxton2">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000332-Shanda1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000332-Diefenbach2">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. Revelation of the process of KSHV particle transport on microtubules during virion assembly provides novel strategies for halting viral replication and treating KSHV-associated diseases. For example, microtubule structure in cells can be disrupted by reagents like nocodazole (an MT destablizer) or taxol (MT stablizer) as many of such reagents are shown to suppress replication of various viruses. Our studies may lead to discovery of new drugs for KS and reveal pharmacological mechanism of the drugs.</p><p>In this study we thus report on the transportation of KSHV viral complexes along microtubules by KIF3A, a kinesin motor which to the best of our knowledge has thus far not been implicated in virus transport. This finding could thus lead researchers to investigate similar roles of KIF3A in transportation of other viruses. Furthermore, our study by delineating the role of ORF45 has helped unravel the initial pathways of KSHV transportation toward egress. However further assembly and transportation of mature enveloped virions still remains an enigma. This final transportation phase could probably involve recruitment of kinesin motors either by the glycoptotein cytoplasmic tails or by membrane associated tegument proteins as suggested for HSV-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000332-Diefenbach2">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. On these lines, a recent study has identified an interaction of HSV-2 membrane-associated tegument protein pUL56 with KIF1A <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000332-Koshizuka1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. This interaction has been speculated to contribute to the axonal transport of viral glycoprotein-containing vesicles. Another study has revealed an association of KIF5B with enveloped HSV-1 containing in abundance the amyloid precursor protein (APP), a kinesin cellular receptor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000332-SatputeKrishnan1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. Though these studies provide interesting observations, further investigation of this phenomenon is warranted. The sequence of events involved in transportation of KSHV viral complexes to the nucleus following cell entry also needs investigation with specific focus on the virion proteins and the cellular motors involved. Information garnered from all these sources would definitely help in providing the entire picture of the KSHV lytic life cycle starting from viral entry and ending with viral egress. Lastly, the significance of the less studied KSHV tegument has been exemplified by the pivotal and multi functional roles of ORF45. This should pave way for future studies examining functional roles of even the other tegument proteins in the viral life cycle.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cells and viruses</title><p>BCBL-1, a latent KSHV-infected primary effusion lymphoma cell line was maintained in RPMI 1640.

Channel recording and control of data acquisition was done as earlier. A series of optical sections of the image were collected at increasing intervals of 0.32 &#x000b5;m from the bottom to the top. This was employed for the reconstruction of a 3-D representation of the specimen on the graphics computer with the LCS 3D software (Leica Microsystems). Digital images obtained were cropped and adjusted for contrast with Photoshop.</p></sec><sec id="s4i"><title>Dominant negative mutant assay</title><p>The C-terminal region of KIF3A (spanning amino acids 409&#x02013;702) was PCR amplified and cloned into the pCMV 3-Tag- (flag) vector between <italic>BamHI</italic> and <italic>XhoI</italic> sites.

At different time points (18, 24 and 36 hours) following infection, the medium was clarified, extracellular virions were collected and DNA isolated.

The KIF3A set consists of four individual shRNA lentiviral vectors in pLKO.1-puro plasmids against different target sites of KIF3A (with Clone IDs NM_007054.4-2737s1c1, -2134s1c1, -781s1c1, -1945s1c1 &#x02013; for convenience sake referred as KIF3A shRNA clone #s 1, 2, 3, 4). The KIF5B/KHC set contains five clones targeting different sites of KIF5B/KHC (with Clone IDs NM_004521.1-3461s1c1, -1376s1c1, -1904s1c1, -391s1c1, -842s1c1 &#x02013; referred as KHC shRNA clone #s 1, 2, 3, 4, 5). A control vector (a non-targeting shRNA that activates the RNAi pathway without targeting any known human gene, SHC002) was also purchased (Sigma-Aldrich). Each of the shRNA vectors as well as the control vector was used to prepare lentiviral stocks by cotransfecting 293T cells with the shRNA vector and two packaging vectors (pHR'8.2&#x00394;R and pCMV-VSV-G) at a ratio of 4&#x02236;3&#x02236;1 respectively. . Three days post-transfection, the culture media that contain shRNA retroviruses were harvested, centrifuged (500&#x000d7;g for 10 min at 4&#x000b0;C), and filtered through a 0.45 &#x000b5;m filter to ensure removal of any non adherent cells.</p><p>BCBL-1 cells were transduced with the shRNA encoding lentivirus stocks in the presence of polybrene (8 &#x000b5;g/ml). Transduced cells were selected with puromycin (2 &#x000b5;g/ml) for a week. Efficacies of these shRNAs in knockdown of the respective proteins were assayed by Western blot with specific antibodies. BCBL-1 cells stably expressing the KIF3A/KHC/control shRNAs were treated with TPA (20 ng/ml) to induce KSHV lytic replication. Four days post-induction, extracellular KSHV virions were collected. DNA extraction from intact virions and viral titer estimation were performed as detailed earlier.</p><p>Sub-confluent 293T monolayer cells were also transduced with the lentivirus stocks in the presence of polybrene and selected with puromycin as above. 293T cells stably expressing the KIF3A/KHC/control shRNAs were infected with HSV-1 at an MOI of 5. Twenty-four hours post-infection, the supernatant medium was clarified, extracellular HSV-1 virions were pelleted and viral DNA isolated. Viral titers were estimated by a real-time PCR as earlier.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="ppat.1000332.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Knockdown of KIF3A and KHC by short-hairpin RNA (shRNA)-mediated silencing and the effects on HSV-1 egress and extracellular viral titers.
