In this species, the in vivo administration of prostaglandin F2-alpha induces apoptosis in large vessels as early as 6 hours after administration. The presence of the prostaglandin F2-alpha receptor (FPr) on the microvascular endothelial cells (pCL-MVECs) of the porcine corpus luteum has not yet been defined. The aim of the study was to assess FPr expression in pCL-MVECs in the early and mid-luteal phases (EL-p, ML-p), and during pregnancy (P-p). Moreover, the effectiveness of prostaglandin F2-alpha treatment in inducing pCL-MVEC apoptosis was tested.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Porcine CLs were collected in the EL and ML phases and during P-p. All CLs from each animal were minced together and the homogenates underwent enzymatic digestion. The pCL-MVECs were then positively selected by an immunomagnetic separation protocol using Dynabeads coated with anti-CD31 monoclonal antibody and seeded in flasks in the presence of EGM 2-MV (Microvascular Endothelial Cell Medium-2). After 4 days of culture, the cells underwent additional immunomagnetic selection and were seeded in flasks until the confluent stage.</p><p>PCR Real time, western blot and immunodetection assays were utilized to assess the presence of FPr on pCL-MVEC primary cultures. Furthermore, the influence of culture time (freshly isolated, cultured overnight and at confluence) and hormonal treatment (P4 and E2) on FPr expression in pCL-MVECs was also investigated. Apoptosis was detected by TUNEL assay of pCL-MVECs exposed to prostaglandin F2-alpha.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We obtained primary cultures of pCL-MVECs from all animals. FPr mRNA and protein levels showed the highest value (ANOVA) in CL-MVECs derived from the early-luteal phase. Moreover, freshly isolated MVECs showed a higher FPr mRNA value than those cultured overnight and confluent cells (ANOVA). prostaglandin F2-alpha treatment failed to induce an apoptotic response in all the pCL-MVEC cultures.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our data showing the presence of FPr on MVECs and the inability of prostaglandin F2-alpha to evoke an in vitro apoptotic response suggest that other molecules or mechanisms must be considered in order to explain the in vivo direct pro-apoptotic effect of prostaglandin F2-alpha at the endothelial level.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The corpus luteum (CL) is a transient endocrine gland essential for the regulation of ovarian cycles as well as for establishing and maintaining pregnancy. Prostaglandin F<sub>2&#x003b1; </sub>(PGF<sub>2&#x003b1;</sub>) is considered the principal luteolysin in domestic animals and acts on target cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] by means of a specific plasma membrane-associate receptor, prostaglandin F2-alpha receptor (FPr). The FPr was detected on steroidogenic luteal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] but its presence on other target cells could not be excluded.</p><p>Our previous data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] showed that, in a porcine CL regression model, cloprostenol (a PGF<sub>2&#x003b1; </sub>synthetic analogue) first induces apoptosis of luteal endothelial cells then apoptosis of steroidogenic cells and suggest that the structural regression of the CL may begin with an early response of the endothelial compartment to PGF<sub>2&#x003b1;</sub>. This hypothesis relies on the assumption that FPrs are present on endothelial cells (ECs). The expression of the FPr was described by RT-PCR in bovine ECs derived from CLs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]; on the contrary, FPr mRNA has been identified only on swine steroidogenic cells by an in situ study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Therefore, to date, the presence of the FPr on luteal ECs is not fully clarified, perhaps due to the different techniques utilized.</p><p>The porcine CL is not sensitive to the luteolytic stimulus until day 12 of the cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Luteal PGF<sub>2&#x003b1; </sub>binding sites increase during CL formation reaching a maximum on day 13 of the oestrous cycle, concurrently with the onset of luteal sensitivity to PGF<sub>2&#x003b1; </sub>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Limited data exist confirming that an FPr increase is responsible for the acquisition of luteolytic sensitivity.</p><p>The importance of the interaction between luteal cells and ECs was demonstrated both in <italic>in vivo </italic>and <italic>in vitro </italic>experiments in bovine and swine species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>The interest in EC biology increased in parallel with the optimization of successful protocols for their isolation and culture, allowing the study of EC involvement in many different physiological or pathological processes. EC isolated from large vessels or from tissue microvasculature show a morphological heterogeneity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] and significant functional differences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Additional differences have been observed among EC isolated from microvessels of different organs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] as well as from different regions of the same organ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. These differences are mainly due to the local micro-environment (e.g., the presence of matrix proteins, soluble cytokines, growth factors and paracrine signals) and to cell-to-cell communication.</p><p>In this context, the isolation and characterization of pCL-MVECs may lead to a better insight into endocrine gland physiology and contribute to explaining some physiological differences during the CL lifespan.</p><p>Many studies have been focused on the CL-MVEC isolation in different species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] except swine where MVEC isolation has been described only in the fetal organs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] and the heart [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p><p>In order to obtain pure MVEC cultures from CLs at different stages (early and mid-luteal phases and during pregnancy), the initial aim of the present study was to define a reliable isolation method. Thus, our subsequent aims were to investigate the presence of the FPr, both at the mRNA and the protein level, on pCL-MVEC and to verify if PGF<sub>2&#x003b1; </sub>treatment is effective in inducing pCL-MVEC apoptosis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>pCL-MVEC culture set-up</title><sec><title>Animals and corpora lutea collection</title><p>Twelve prepubertal Large White gilts (94 &#x000b1; 1.47 Kg body weight) were injected i.m. with 1250 iu (international units) of equine chorionic gonadotropin (eCG; Folligon-Intervet, Holland) and, 60 h later, with 750 iu of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG; Corulon-Intervet) to synchronize ovulation.

A positive selection with the employment of anti-CD-31-coupled magnetic beads was carried out twice. In order to support the attachment of MVECs, a basal medium optimized for bovine lung-derived MVECs supplemented with growth factors (hEGF, VEGF, hFGF, Hydrocortisone) was used until day 4 of the culture. Rare fibroblasts and parenchymal cells were observed in the culture before applying the second positive selection procedure. Cells reached confluence in a specific medium for human endothelial cells supplemented with 15% FBS. The time required to reach confluence varied for each pCL-MVEC culture; however, we observed that EL-p-derived pCL-MVECs proliferated faster than the others. This was in agreement with the high mitotic index of ECs observed during CL formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Confluent pCL-MVEC monolayers showed a heterogeneous morphology as documented in bovine CL-MVECs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Various cell phenotypes were present with a predominance of cobble-stone-like and spindle-shaped cells in all pCL-MVECs without any relationship between the morphological types and CL phases analyzed, as reported for bovines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. The endothelial origin of the cells was confirmed by traditional endothelial cell marker expression. Moreover, the absence of StAR mRNA in the EC cultures indicated the absence of steroidogenic cell contamination in the confluent MVEC cultures.</p><p>FPr expression in CL tissues was found in all the stages analyzed with an increasing trend from the EL- to the ML- phase reaching the maximum during pregnancy, both at mRNA and protein levels in agreement with data already published for the porcine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] and the bovine species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Our study documents, for the first time, the presence of the FPr on MVECs isolated from swine corpora lutea. We observed that the degree of expression of FPr mRNA varied among the pCL-MVEC cultures in relation to the different CL phases, the highest in the EL-p, decreasing in the ML-p and reaching its lowest level in the P-phase. At the protein level, the presence of the FPr was evidenced in all EC cultures. The amount of FPr protein was very similar among the MVECs derived from ML-p and P-p CLs and pAECs, and was significantly higher on MVECs derived from EL-p CLs. Our data, showing the presence of the FPr on MVECs at early stages testify to the fact that the refractoriness in this species was not be related to the absence of the receptor and rather that other mechanisms must be considered.</p><p>The FPr expression level in freshly isolated, overnight and long-term cultured MVECs, was gradually reduced reaching its minimum value at the confluent stage, in agreement with a recent study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] showing that ECs modify their phenotypes when removed from the microenvironment. Nevertheless, in our model, steroid supplementation (P<sub>4 </sub>and E<sub>2</sub>) resembling the in vivo hormonal environment was not able to regulate FPr expression. Further studies may be required to establish if and how culture conditions may influence FPr expression as well as to investigate if the receptor is functional on pCL-MVECs. The FPr presence on porcine MVECs is in agreement with data obtained for bovine CLs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and contrast with those obtained for swine CLs in an in situ mRNA study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], thus confirming the hypothesis that the discrepancies among these studies are related to the different techniques used.</p><p>Finally, the immunolocalization of the FPr on MVECs showed positive staining at plasma membrane level as well as a diffuse perinuclear and cytoplasmatic localization in all cultures. Perinuclear FPr immunoreactivity may be an interaction between the outer membrane of the nuclei and the endoplasmic reticulum where nascent FP protein is formed before being transported to the plasma membrane. The perinuclear staining of P-p CL-MVECs was more intense than others, suggesting an intensive synthesis/glycosilation of the receptor. All these findings are consistent with the distribution of the FPr on ECs of human ocular tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>] and on the rat myometrium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>] as well as other prostaglandin receptors on porcine cerebral endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>].</p><p>In our model, PGF<sub>2&#x003b1; </sub>failed to induce an apoptotic response in all pCL MVEC cultures, in agreement with other in vitro studies conducted on bovines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. These results contrast with <italic>in vivo </italic>experiments which indicated endothelial cell apoptosis as an early hallmark of PGF<sub>2&#x003b1;</sub>-induced luteal regression in many species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. Therefore, we can affirm that PGF<sub>2&#x003b1; </sub>does not directly induce apoptosis of porcine MVECs in our in vitro model, but the involvement of other molecules should be investigated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>All the authors participated in the experimental design and collected biological material.
