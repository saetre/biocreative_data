In human, an LTR serves as a tissue-specific promoter, active primarily in testis. However, in rodents, our evidence indicates that an ancestral LTR common to all rodent genes is the major, constitutive promoter for these genes, and that a second LTR found in two of the mouse genes is a minor promoter. Thus, independently acquired LTRs have assumed regulatory roles for orthologous genes, a remarkable evolutionary scenario. We also demonstrate that 5&#x02032; flanking regions of IAP family genes as a group, in both human and mouse are enriched for LTR insertions compared to average genes. We propose several potential explanations for these findings, including a hypothesis that recruitment of LTRs near <italic>NAIP</italic> or other IAP genes may represent a host-cell adaptation to modulate apoptotic responses.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="synopsis"><title>Author Summary</title><p>When retroviruses infect cells, the viral DNA inserts into the cellular genome. If this happens in gametes (egg or sperm), the viral DNA will be transmitted from parent to offspring, like all chromosomal DNA. Through evolutionary time, such infections of gametes have been so prevalent that 8&#x00025;&#x02013;10&#x00025; of the normal human and mouse genomes are now composed of ancient viral DNA, termed endogenous retroviruses (ERVs). In human, these ERVs are mutated or &#x0201c;dead&#x0201d; but it has been shown that ERV regulatory regions can be employed by the host to help control expression of cellular genes. Here, we report on a remarkable example of this phenomenon. We demonstrate that both the human and rodent neuronal apoptosis inhibitory protein <italic>(NAIP)</italic> genes, involved in preventing cell death, use different ERV sequences to drive gene expression. Moreover, in each of the primate and rodent lineages, two separate ERVs contribute to <italic>NAIP</italic> gene expression. This repeated ERV recruitment by <italic>NAIP</italic> genes throughout evolution is very unlikely to have occurred by chance. We offer a number of potential explanations, including the intriguing possibility that it may be advantageous for anti-cell death genes like <italic>NAIP</italic> to use ERVs to control their expression. These results support the view that not all retroviral remnants in our genome are simply junk DNA.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Romanish MT, Lock WM, van de Lagemaat LN, Dunn CA, Mager DL (2007) Repeated recruitment of LTR retrotransposons as promoters by the anti-apoptotic locus <italic>NAIP</italic> during mammalian evolution.

We screened primary RNA samples from human blood, colon, placenta, and testis by 5&#x02032; rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) and could not confirm this TSS in these tissues. As Xu et al. did, we also attempted to localize a 5&#x02032; start site in the region by RT-PCR using successively tiled primers along the length of the MER21C/HERV-P, and extending beyond its 5&#x02032; flank, combined with a common reverse primer. This analysis of blood, placenta, and testis cDNA yielded numerous products, due to the repetitive nature of the target sequence. Using Southern blotting, we resolved specific products for all primer sets across the MER21C/HERV-P complex. In addition, one primer upstream of this complex, located between the adjacent MIR short interspersed element (SINE) and nearby AluSc SINE, also gave a product of the expected size, but a primer upstream of the AluSc did not (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030010-g001">Figure 1</xref>A and unpublished data). These data suggest that a <italic>NAIP</italic> promoter may exist which incorporates SINE and LTR sequences into a repeat-rich 5&#x02032; UTR. While 5&#x02032; RACE was unsuccessful in confirming the previously published start site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030010-g001">Figure 1</xref>A, form iii), evidence for at least two other promoters was discovered. The principal TSS in all tissues tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030010-g001">Figure 1</xref>A, form i), also strongly supported by EST data, lies within the third exon of the published cDNA from THP1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030010-g001">Figure 1</xref>A, form iii), suggesting that the major promoter is upstream of this TSS. In testis, we identified two other closely spaced TSSs: remarkably they lie within the same MER21C/HERV-P complex but are located in the 3&#x02032; LTR of the HERV-P element, suggesting use of this LTR as an alternative promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030010-g001">Figure 1</xref>A, form ii)<bold>.</bold> One of these HERV-P TSSs is supported by a testis EST. Using quantitative RT-PCR, we determined that this HERV-P LTR promoter is responsible for &#x0223c;12&#x00025; of total <italic>NAIP</italic> transcripts in normal testis but none were detectable in kidney (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030010-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). We also confirmed by RT-PCR that a full-length transcript encoding an intact NAIP open reading frame (ORF) is produced from the LTR promoter (unpublished data). Various transcriptional regulatory features such as a putative TATA box and initiator and downstream promoter elements &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030010-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d; were identified in the sequence underlying sites of LTR and non-LTR <italic>NAIP</italic> transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030010-g001">Figure 1</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030010-g001">1</xref>D). Interestingly, the 5&#x02032; most TSS within the HERV-P LTR overlies an initiator element &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030010-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d; that overlaps the putative CCAAT box previously detected in other members of this family of LTRs &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030010-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d;. However, the putative TATA box identified in that study, while present in our example, does not appear to be used, as it is located downstream of the TSSs identified by 5&#x02032; RACE. These features and the extents of all 5&#x02032; RACE clones are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030010-g001">Figure 1</xref>C. To verify our identified <italic>NAIP</italic> TSSs, we checked the &#x0201c;cap analysis of gene expression&#x0201d; (CAGE) database &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030010-b027">27</xref>&#x0005d; for mapped TSSs for the human <italic>NAIP</italic> gene, but none were found.</p><p>As mentioned above, database screens suggested that transcription of the mouse <italic>Naip</italic> genes initiates within an ORR1E LTR common to all mouse copies.

For all other mouse <italic>Naip</italic> genes, the major TSSs mapped within the common ORR1E LTR, confirming the database screens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030010-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). Due to the conserved position of a motif resembling a TATA box, sequence identity of flanking nucleotides, and localization of most TSSs 25&#x02013;32 bp downstream of the TATA motif for all <italic>mNaip</italic> copies, these LTRs appear to be typical TATA box promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030010-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). The <italic>mNaipb</italic> gene is the only mouse gene with more than one CAGE tag, and two clusters of these tags correspond very well to our identified TSSs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030010-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). This 5&#x02032; RACE analysis also uncovered two alternative promoters for some of the mouse genes, one of which is a second LTR. The progenitor of the <italic>mNaip</italic>e/<italic>f</italic> paralogs was targeted by an MTC LTR &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030010-b024">24</xref>&#x0005d;, immediately 5&#x02032; of the first coding exon, prior to the duplication that created these two genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030010-g002">Figure 2</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030010-g002">2</xref>C).

The most probable scenario to explain the presence of ORR1E LTRs upstream of all rodent <italic>Naip</italic> genes is that the element inserted upstream of the ancestral rodent gene and then was included in subsequent duplication events involving the gene. At a later stage, the <italic>mNaipe/f</italic> progenitor acquired an MTC LTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030010-g005">Figure 5</xref>).

Earlier work identified <italic>NAIP</italic> expression in liver and placenta by Northern blot using a coding region probe and in spinal cord and lymphoblasts following nested RT-PCR spanning coding exons &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030010-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;. Our expression screens by RT-PCR of a broad panel of tissues confirmed these findings and extended them to include all tested tissues. Constitutive <italic>NAIP</italic> expression most likely initiates within the non-LTR promoter we have identified here. Quantitative RT-PCR indicated that, in normal testis, the HERV-P LTR is a significant but relatively minor <italic>NAIP</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030010-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). Nonetheless, the activity of this LTR promoter in testis, and previous description of the MER21C LTR promoter active in a leukemic cell line &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030010-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;, coupled with reports of elevated <italic>NAIP</italic> expression in myelodysplastic syndromes and leukemia &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030010-b035">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030010-b036">36</xref>&#x0005d;, provides an enticing model to study potential upregulation of these LTR promoters in certain forms of cancer, possibly through hypomethylation, since both LTRs are CpG-rich (unpublished data).</p><p>In rodents, the results presented here demonstrate that the mouse and rat <italic>Naip</italic> genes employ a common ORR1E LTR as their major promoter. ORR1s and MTs are rodent-specific LTR families within the MaLR superfamily &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030010-b024">24</xref>&#x0005d;, represented by &#x0003e;400,000 copies in the sequenced mouse genome &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030010-b002">2</xref>&#x0005d;. The fact that the ORR1E LTR is the primary promoter for these genes is unusual, considering LTRs most often function as tissue-specific or alternative promoters &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030010-b007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030010-b008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030010-b031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030010-b032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030010-b037">37</xref>&#x0005d;. Another intriguing finding is the fact that an MTC LTR has inserted into the <italic>mNaipe/f</italic> progenitor and behaves as a secondary promoter. Thus, the <italic>NAIP</italic> locus represents an extremely rare case of repeated recruitment of distinct LTRs as promoters during the course of mammalian evolution.</p><p>In a previous study, we found that more rapidly evolving genes or mammalian-specific genes are more likely to incorporate TEs into their UTRs, compared to genes at large &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030010-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d;. <italic>NAIP</italic> represents an example of such a gene since no nonmammalian ortholog is known and its rate of protein evolution as measured by a human-rodent Ka/Ks value of 0.44 (TAED Adaptive Evolution Database &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030010-b038">38</xref>&#x0005d;) is above the median for all genes of 0.115 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030010-b002">2</xref>&#x0005d;. Ka/Ks is the normalized ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous nucleotide substitution rates in coding sequence &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030010-b002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030010-b038">38</xref>&#x0005d;). Nonetheless, assuming roughly 20,000 orthologous genes between humans and mice and a &#x0223c;0.7&#x00025; frequency of human RefSeq genes employing LTR elements as promoters &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030010-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d; (unpublished data), we predict just a single example of orthologous gene pairs having adopted lineage-specific LTR promoters by chance. Examples of the same primate locus acquiring independent Alu insertions have been reported &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030010-b039">39</xref>&#x0005d;, but we are unaware of other cases where distinct TEs provide regulatory function to orthologous genes. Remarkably, in both lineages, more than one LTR insertion contributes to <italic>NAIP</italic> promoter activity, a combination of events extremely unlikely to be due to chance alone. Several potential factors that could have contributed to this phenomenon are presented below.</p><p>The first factor could be that the region upstream of this gene is subject to a lower selective constraint compared to most other genes, resulting in TE accumulation and increasing the probability that some may assume a regulatory role. Indeed, the fact that <italic>NAIP</italic> is part of the IAP gene family, with potentially overlapping or redundant functions, may have resulted in increased host tolerance to regulatory change of any individual family member. Supporting this possibility is the fact that genomic coverage by LTR sequences and SINEs upstream of human and mouse IAP genes is above average (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030010-g007">Figure 7</xref>). Moreover, the tandemly duplicated mouse <italic>Naip</italic> genes have a higher LTR coverage and insertion number relative to most other mouse IAP genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030010-st001">Table S1</xref>). These genes represent the high end of the genomic spectrum in terms of LTR and SINE density, which could indicate that their regulatory requirements are flexible and localized to small domains. Representing the opposite end of the spectrum are <italic>Hox</italic> genes and other critical transcription factor genes or developmental genes which are located in regions nearly devoid of all TEs &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030010-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030010-b040">40</xref>&#x0005d;, likely because their complex regulation requires extended regions to be free of interruptions.</p><p>Interestingly, while LTR and SINE density 5&#x02032; of IAP genes is above average, LINE density is not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030010-g007">Figure 7</xref>), indicating that not all TEs have accumulated in the region. In addition, the high density of SINEs upstream of IAP genes may be related to the known role of the highly repetitive SINE sequences in facilitating genomic rearrangements &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030010-b041">41</xref>&#x0005d;. The BIR domain was amplified to create the IAP family, <italic>NAIP</italic> genes have amplified variably in rodents &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030010-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;, and two other IAPs, <italic>cIAP1</italic> and <italic>2,</italic> are tandemly duplicated copies present in primates and rodents &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030010-b042">42</xref>&#x0005d;, implicating ongoing genomic rearrangements in IAP gene expansion. Moreover, while the IAP genes are classified as a gene family due to the shared BIR domain, mouse gene knockout evidence suggests these proteins do not encode entirely overlapping functions. When only <italic>mNaipa</italic> is deleted, mice display poor neuronal survival under pathological conditions &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030010-b043">43</xref>&#x0005d;. However, the effect of eliminating all <italic>mNaip</italic> copies remains unknown. Deletion of two other IAP family members, <italic>Survivin</italic> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030010-b044">44</xref>&#x0005d; and <italic>Bruce</italic> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030010-b045">45</xref>&#x0005d; result in embryonic lethality. <italic>XIAP-</italic>deficient mice develop normally &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030010-b046">46</xref>&#x0005d;, but recent reports indicate that it encodes a nonredundant function related to TRAIL-mediated apoptotic signaling &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030010-b047">47</xref>&#x0005d;. Targeting of the <italic>cIAP2</italic> locus leads to a defective innate immune response &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030010-b048">48</xref>&#x0005d;. Finally<italic>, ML-IAP</italic> is overexpressed in human melanoma cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030010-b049">49</xref>&#x0005d; and <italic>Ts-IAP</italic> expression is testis-specific &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030010-b050">50</xref>&#x0005d;. These nonoverlapping phenotypes indicate that some degree of selection must operate on their regulatory regions.</p><p>A second potential explanation is that, compared to most genes, the 5&#x02032; flanking regions of <italic>NAIP</italic> may have been more receptive to initial retroviral or retroelement insertion, increasing the chance of LTR recruitment by this gene. Different classes of retroviruses and retroelements have distinct integration site preferences &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030010-b051">51</xref>&#x0005d;. For example, HIV favors integration within active genes, murine leukemia virus favors the 5&#x02032; ends of genes, Ty1 and Ty3 LTR retroelements of <named-content content-type="genus-species">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</named-content> target regions upstream of pol III-transcribed genes, and Ty5 targets heterochromatic regions &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030010-b051">51</xref>&#x0005d;. An interesting recent report has documented that promoters of heat-shock genes in <italic>Drosophila</italic> are particularly prone to insertions by P elements, a very young family of DNA transposons, likely at least in part due to the unusual constitutively open chromatin associated with these genes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030010-b052">52</xref>&#x0005d;. In the case under study here, since the HERV-P and MER21C elements upstream of the primate <italic>NAIP</italic> gene are members of the broad &#x0201c;class I&#x0201d; subdivision of ERVs &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030010-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;, which also include murine leukemia virus, it is possible that these ERVs also prefer 5&#x02032; flanks of genes for integration. On the other hand, the rodent ORR1E and MTC LTRs of the MaLR superfamily (class III in Repbase nomenclature &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030010-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;) are not related to any elements with known integration site preferences, thus we cannot speculate as to whether such elements may have originally favored regions upstream of genes. It is known that the overall genomic densities of class III elements are highest in regions further from genes compared to other ERV classes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030010-b053">53</xref>&#x0005d;. Furthermore, it seems unlikely that the upstream region of <italic>NAIP</italic> specifically, compared to all genes, would present a favored integration target for widely different retroviral types in different species.</p><p>Since it is generally assumed that the genomic distribution patterns of ancient ERVs are shaped by selection and bear little resemblance to their original integration site preferences that are unknown, a third hypothesis to account for repeated LTR cooption by <italic>NAIP</italic> is based on this gene's function. Perhaps utilization of retroviral LTRs as promoters for <italic>NAIP</italic> is somehow advantageous to the host, resulting in their selective retention during evolution. For example, activation of <italic>NAIP</italic> via an LTR promoter may provide an avenue for germ cells to escape transitory, stress-induced apoptotic signals. LTR promoters may be particularly responsive to upregulation by cellular stresses since it has been shown that activation of human and mouse ERV LTRs can occur following stresses such as viral infection &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030010-b054">54</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030010-b056">56</xref>&#x0005d; and UV irradiation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030010-b057">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030010-b058">58</xref>&#x0005d;.

Although nothing is known about a potential NAIP stress response in the germ line, it has been demonstrated that <italic>NAIP</italic> mRNA and protein is upregulated in neurons following ischemic stress &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030010-b064">64</xref>&#x0005d;. It is also interesting that activity of the human <italic>NAIP</italic> HERV-P LTR promoter is highest in testis, and, in general, ERVs are transcribed highly in germ cells and early embryogenesis compared to most normal somatic cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030010-b032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030010-b065">65</xref>&#x0005d;. While there is no evidence that other IAP genes, with the exception of <italic>NAIP,</italic> use LTR promoters, the proposed upregulation may involve gene activation by nearby LTR enhancers, offering an explanation for the fact that LTR density upstream of IAP genes as a group is high compared to random genes. Alternatively, <italic>NAIP</italic> may be unique among IAP genes in retaining LTR promoters because of its specialized functions or flexibility in regulatory control.</p><p>Finally, a related, but much more speculative hypothesis to explain LTR usage by the <italic>NAIP</italic> genes postulates that the present state reflects a viral mechanism to evade apoptosis. Infection by retroviruses can lead to induction of apoptosis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030010-b066">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030010-b067">67</xref>&#x0005d;, and HIV Nef activates caspases &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030010-b066">66</xref>&#x0005d;, the targets of IAP proteins. Waves of intracellular retrotransposition can also be associated with increased apoptosis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030010-b068">68</xref>&#x0005d;. Therefore, retroviral/retroelement insertions in germ line cells which, by chance, induce expression of anti-apoptotic genes, could abort an initial or transitory stress-induced apoptotic response, increasing the probability that cells harboring such insertions would survive and contribute to subsequent generations, assuming they have not suffered damage. In such a scenario, an LTR would only need to exert regulatory effects for a short window in time immediately after insertion, before being silenced (for example, by DNA methylation), or it could continue to be used as a promoter if such activity is not detrimental to the organism, as in the case of the <italic>NAIP</italic> genes. Viruses have evolved numerous ways of circumventing host defense strategies and aborting apoptosis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030010-b069">69</xref>&#x0005d;. Indeed, one such example is the viral origin of the anti-apoptotic BIR domain, shared by all IAP genes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030010-b070">70</xref>&#x0005d;. Perhaps repeated targeting of LTR elements to regulatory regions of <italic>NAIP</italic> genes represents another viral mechanism aimed at maintaining cellular viability. Nonetheless, retroviral or other TE insertions in the germ line will not be tolerated by the host species unless they are neutral and fixed by random chance, or are advantageous. Thus, such hypothetical scenarios are tenable only if the LTR insertions do not have a detrimental impact on cell function or on organismal development.</p><p>In conclusion, we have shown here that ERV LTRs have been repeatedly coopted to serve regulatory roles for the mammalian <italic>NAIP</italic> genes and presented various potential explanations to account for this phenomenon. These results document a striking example of how ancient ERV insertions can be domesticated or &#x0201c;exapted&#x0201d; &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030010-b009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030010-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d; by the host, contributing to gene regulatory evolution.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>RNA isolation.</title><p>Primary mouse tissue samples were dissected from healthy adult male C57BL/6J (B6) mice, and preserved in RNA Later (Ambion, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ambion.com">http://www.ambion.com</ext-link>).

Base pair coverage by different retroelement classes among human and mouse IAP genes (eight in human, <italic>BIRC1&#x02013;8;</italic> eight in mouse, <italic>mNaipa/b</italic> and <italic>Birc2&#x02013;7</italic>) was compared to 1,000 randomly selected comparable-sized sets of genes. The <italic>mNaipe/f</italic> genes were excluded because they were recently duplicated from a <italic>mNaipb</italic>-like gene. Numbers of LTR insertions in the window for the human and mouse IAP genes (manually checked for accuracy) are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030010-st001">Table S1</xref>. However, because indels and rearrangements of ancient TEs hampered accurate automated tabulation of numbers of insertion events for the random sets of genes, we instead determined total base pair coverage by the three retroelement classes upstream of the IAP genes and random sets of genes. For ERV-like elements, we considered the LTR part only, because LTRs are known to harbor regulatory signals. We therefore excluded sequences annotated as ERV internal sequences, which are annotated in human with names including the text strings &#x0201c;ERVL,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;HERV,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;-int,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;Harlequin,&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;HUERS-.&#x0201d; In mouse, internal sequences were identified by names including the text strings &#x0201c;&#x0005f;I,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;-int,&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;ERV.&#x0201d;</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pgen-0030010-sg001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><title>Analysis of Human <italic>NAIP</italic> 5&#x02032; UTR and Coding Region Splice Isoforms</title><p>Cloned RT-PCR products amplified by primers specific for the two alternative LTR-derived transcripts are shown.</p><p>(A) Represents RT-PCR products specific for the HERV-P-driven form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030010-g001">Figure 1</xref>A, form ii).

Recruitment of a heterogeneous ERV (5&#x02032;-HAL1/LINE:AluJb/SINE-3&#x02032;) was detected in sequenced clones from these isoforms. We also observed occasional exclusion of the exon from which most 5&#x02032; RACE clones were found to initiate (Figure1A, form i). These UTR variants could not be compared to those reported by Xu et al. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030010-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d; as their sequences are not available.</p><p>(C) Splice variants identified by RT-PCR using primers specific for coding region exons are shown. Downstream of the first coding exon, 74 bp of a 102-bp remnant of an antisense MIRm SINE is recruited into the coding region of human <italic>NAIP</italic> in peripheral blood leukocytes. While verified by direct sequencing only in peripheral blood leukocytes, we infer transcription of this isoform in all tissues because the same band is seen in all lanes of our expression profiling experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030010-g004">Figure 4</xref>A, top band, panel O). This isoform does not preserve the established ORF (&#x0002b;292 to &#x0002b;4,503, relative to the transcript form previously reported &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030010-b017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030010-b033">33</xref>&#x0005d;) and is predicted to yield a truncated protein encoding only the first and part of the second BIR domain (&#x0002b;292 to &#x0002b;888, relative to the previously reported transcript). However, downstream of the intervening MIRm SINE we report on a predicted ORF (&#x0002b;919 to &#x0002b;4,578) initiating at a start codon in-frame with the standard one (&#x0002b;292) that retains part of the second BIR, entire third BIR followed by the expected NBS and LRR motifs. Another minor isoform splices out the second coding exon, also disrupting the normal ORF, but utilizes an in-frame start codon to yield a novel predicted peptide (&#x0002b;993 to &#x0002b;4,412) encoding the third BIR and NBS and LRR motifs.

Size of the ORR1E exon shows some variability among <italic>mNaip</italic> copies. Only <italic>mNaipa/b</italic> utilize a second, downstream exon within their 5&#x02032; UTRs (labeled 2). <italic>mNaipb</italic> also demonstrates recruitment of two other novel exons into its 5&#x02032; UTR, one of which utilizes partial B1F1/SINE sequence. Interestingly, we observe a <italic>mNaipe</italic> isoform that is not spliced across the length of its 5&#x02032; UTR; we are unable to comment whether it yields a functional protein, but might represent a primary transcript not yet processed by splicing machinery.</p><p>(B) Splice variants for each <italic>mNaip</italic> copy using primers across coding region exons are shown. All coordinates noted below are relative to the accession numbers of the mouse Naip transcripts listed in the Accession Number section. Similar to human, we find recruitment of a repetitive exon into the <italic>mNaipa</italic> coding region, here 129 bp of the 5&#x02032; segment of a 554-bp antisense Lx LINE remnant splices in downstream of the second coding exon. This novel exon introduces an in-frame stop codon and the resulting truncated protein (&#x0002b;113 to &#x0002b;904, relative to the reported <italic>mNaipa</italic> transcript) encodes only the first two BIR domains. In addition, a novel ORF (&#x0002b;1,023 to &#x0002b;4,442) where the new initiation codon downstream of the intervening Lx LINE is in-frame with the standard one (&#x0002b;113) could potentially be translated to encode a protein incorporating the third BIR domain followed by the NBS and LRR. Similarly truncated proteins are expected for the isoforms of <italic>mNaipe</italic> and <italic>f</italic> which splice out the second coding exon. The C-terminal truncated peptide (&#x0002b;200 to &#x0002b;847, relative to the reported <italic>mNaipe</italic> and <italic>f</italic> transcripts) terminates within the third coding exon and is predicted to encode the first and part of the second BIR. A start codon in-frame with the standard one (&#x0002b;200) within the fifth coding exon yields an ORF (&#x0002b;892 to &#x0002b;4,311) that encodes the third BIR, followed by the NBS and LRR.
