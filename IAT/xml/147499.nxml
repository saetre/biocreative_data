Here we report the isolation and characterization of the cDNA sequence encoding rabbit eEF1A-2, an isoform of eEF1A, as well as a structural and functional comparison of the two rabbit isoforms. Northern analysis of the expression pattern of eEF1A-2 showed that this isoform is expressed in skeletal muscle, heart, brain and aorta, while transcripts are not detected in liver, kidney, spleen and lung. In contrast, the previously characterized eEF1A-1 isoform is expressed in all tissues examined except skeletal muscle. We have recently purified eEF1A-2 from rabbit skeletal muscle. By partial amino acid sequencing and determination of the post-translational modifications of eEF1A-2 we found that both of the glycerylphosphorylethanolamine modifications observed in eEF1A-1 appear to be present in eEF1A-2. However, two of the residues found dimethylated in eEF1A-1 appeared to be trimethylated in eEF1A-2. A comparison of the enzymatic activity showed that eEF1A-1 and eEF1A-2 have indistinguishable activity in an in vitro translation system. In contrast, the GDP dissociation rate constant is approximately 7 times higher for eEF1A-1 than for eEF1A-2. The nucleotide preference ratio (GDP/GTP) for eEF1A-1 was 0.82, while the preference ratio for eEF1A-2 was 1.50.</p></abstract></article-meta></front></article>
