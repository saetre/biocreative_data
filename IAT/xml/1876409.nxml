Whether ethnicity itself has a relevant or substantial contribution on those effect estimates is controversial. Comparative analyses between the ethnic groups may allow general conclusions to be drawn about polygenic disorders.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Methods and Findings</title><p>We performed a literature-based systematic review of genetic association studies in stroke in persons of non-European descent. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95&#x00025; confidence intervals (CIs) were determined for each gene&#x02013;disease association using fixed and random effect models. We further performed a comparative genetic analysis across the different ethnic groups (including persons of European descent derived from our previous meta-analysis) to determine if genetic risks varied by ethnicity. Following a review of 500 manuscripts, eight candidate gene variants were analysed among 32,431 individuals (12,883 cases and 19,548 controls), comprising mainly Chinese, Japanese, and Korean individuals. Of the eight candidate genes studied, three were associated with ischaemic stroke: the <italic>angiotensin I converting enzyme (ACE)</italic> insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism with a mean OR of 1.90 (95&#x00025; CI 1.23&#x02013;2.93) in the Chinese and 1.74 (95&#x00025; CI 0.88&#x02013;3.42) in the Japanese; the summary OR for the C677T variant of <italic>5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR)</italic> was 1.18 (95&#x00025; CI 0.90&#x02013;1.56) in Chinese and 1.34 (95&#x00025; CI 0.87&#x02013;2.06) in Koreans; and the pooled OR for the <italic>apolipoprotein E (APOE)</italic> gene was 2.18 (95&#x00025; CI 1.52&#x02013;3.13) in Chinese and 1.51 (95&#x00025; CI 0.93&#x02013;2.45) in Japanese. Comparing the commonly investigated stroke genes among the Asian groups against studies in persons of European descent, we found an absence of any substantial qualitative or quantitative interaction for ORs by ethnicity. However, the number of individuals recruited per study in the studies of persons of non-European descent was significantly smaller compared to studies of persons of European descent, despite a similar number of studies conducted per gene.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Conclusions</title><p>These data suggest that genetic associations studied to date for ischaemic stroke among persons of non-European descent are similar to those for persons of European descent. Claims of differences in genetic effects among different ethnic populations for complex disorders such as stroke may be overstated. However, due to the limited number of gene variants evaluated, the relatively smaller number of individuals included in the meta-analyses of persons of non-European descent in stroke, and the possibility of publication bias, the existence of allele variants with differential effects by ethnicity cannot be excluded.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>This meta-analysis found that genetic associations so far studied for ischemic stroke among non-Europeans are similar to those found for persons of European descent.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="editor"><title>Editors' Summary</title><sec id="sb1a"><title>Background.</title><p>A stroke occurs when the blood supply to part of the brain is interrupted, either because a blood vessel supplying the brain becomes blocked or because one ruptures. Strokes are a substantial cause of death and disability worldwide, with most of the burden affecting people living in developed countries. Most strokes fall into a category termed ischemic stroke. This type is caused by blockages in the blood vessels supplying the brain, which can happen when there is a buildup of fatty deposits or clots within the blood vessels. Many of the risk factors for this particular type of stroke are affected by an individual's behavior, including for example smoking, high blood pressure, diabetes, inactivity, and so on. In addition, variations in an individual's genetic makeup might affect his or her chance of having a stroke. Previous research studies have shown that variants in many different genes are likely to be involved in determining the overall risk of having a stroke, each variant contributing in a small way to the risk.</p></sec><sec id="sb1b"><title>Why Was This Study Done?</title><p>The group performing this study had previously carried out a systematic review of existing research, looking specifically at the genetics of ischemic stroke among people of European origin (often called &#x0201c;Caucasians&#x0201d;). However, it was not obvious whether the genetic risk factors for stroke they found would be the same for people from a different ethnic background. Therefore the research group wanted to find out what the genetic risk factors were for stroke among people of non-European origin and to compare these findings with those of their previous systematic review. This research might help to find out whether the genetic risk factors for stroke were different in people from different parts of the world.</p></sec><sec id="sb1c"><title>What Did the Researchers Do and Find?</title><p>As a starting point, these researchers wanted to find all the different studies that had already been carried out examining the effect of genetic risk factors on stroke among people of non-European origin. To do this, searches were carried out of electronic databases using a particular set of terms. All resulting studies that involved genetic research in people of non-European origin and in which strokes were confirmed by brain scanning were then evaluated in more detail. The findings of different studies were combined if at least three studies were available for the same genetic variant. Eventually 60 studies were found that looked at the association between eight specific gene variants and stroke. The only data that could be included in a combined analysis came from Chinese, Japanese, and Korean populations. Three of the eight gene variants were associated with an increased risk of stroke. Those three gene variants were <italic>ACE</italic> I/D (a variant in the gene coding for angiotensin 1-converting enzyme, which is involved in controlling blood pressure); a variant in <italic>MTHFR</italic> (which codes for the enzyme methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase, and which converts certain amino acids within cells); and a variant in the gene <italic>APOE,</italic> which codes for a protein that plays a role in breaking down fats. The researchers then compared their findings from this study with the findings of a previous systematic review they had carried out among people of European origin. Overall, each gene studied seemed to have a similar effect in the different populations, with the exception of <italic>APOE,</italic> which seemed to be associated with stroke in the Asian studies but not in the studies from people of non-European origin. The researchers also found that generally the Asian studies suggested a slightly greater effect of each gene variant than the studies in people of non-European origin did.</p></sec><sec id="sb1d"><title>What Do These Findings Mean?</title><p>These findings suggest that, with the possible exception of <italic>APOE,</italic> similar gene variants play a role in determining stroke risk in people of European origin and Asian populations. Although generally the studies examined here suggested a slightly greater effect of these gene variants in Asian populations, this is not necessarily a real finding. This greater effect may just be due to small-study bias. Small-study bias describes the observation that small research studies are more likely to produce a false positive result than are large research studies. Therefore, future studies that examine the genetic basis of stroke should recruit much larger numbers of participants from populations made up of people of non-European origin than has previously been the case.</p></sec><sec id="sb1e"><title>Additional Information.</title><p>Please access these Web sites via the online version of this summary at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0040131">http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0040131</ext-link>.</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Health Encyclopedia entry on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nhsdirect.nhs.uk/articles/article.aspx?ArticleID=351">stroke</ext-link> from NHS Direct (UK National Health Service patient information)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Stroke Information page from the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/stroke/stroke.htm">National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</ext-link> (provided by the US National Institutes of Health)</p></list-item><list-item><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.stroke.org.uk/">The Stroke Association</ext-link>, a UK charity funding this study</p></list-item><list-item><p>Information from the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/cardiovascular_diseases/en/">World Health Organization</ext-link> on the distribution and burden of stroke worldwide</p></list-item><list-item><p>The WHO has a <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/cardiovascular_diseases/resources/atlas/en/">world atlas of heart disease and stroke</ext-link></p></list-item></list></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Ariyaratnam R, Casas JP, Whittaker J, Smeeth L, Hingorani AD, et al.

Most experts working in the field generally advise avoiding the use of quantitative scoring of study quality in meta-analyses, as such an approach has not been validated and can itself introduce bias. One of the reasons, highly relevant in genetic studies, is the often inadequate reporting that constrains the elaboration of such scores to judge the study quality. In addition, there is little or no empirical evidence to guide reviewers on which aspects of study design have an influence on the results obtained. Study size is, however, a widely used proxy for study quality. We therefore undertook a sensitivity analysis, in which concordance of the overall result for each meta-analyses was conducted with the results after excluding the largest study. The key issue in the assessment of stroke as an outcome is classification as ischaemic or haemorrhagic. To minimize outcome misclassification, we therefore restricted our analyses to those studies in which neuroimaging was used to classify the stroke as ischaemic.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Candidate Genes in Persons of Non-European Descent</title><p>A total of 500 manuscripts were identified in our initial search, of which 60 met the inclusion criteria including studies among Chinese, Japanese, Koreans, African Americans, and South Asians.

The current meta-analysis suggests the existence of gene variants, similar to those evaluated in persons of European descent, associated with ischaemic stroke in persons of non-European descent, mostly represented by studies from populations of Asian background with scarce data from other ethnic groups.</p><p>Although some candidate gene variants showed a statistically significant increase in risk of stroke, the robustness of these results remains open to discussion. The observed genetic effect on stroke in the persons of non-European descent, especially in Chinese samples, tended to be higher than the effect observed in persons of European descent, as well as with that observed in other Asian groups such as the Japanese population. These findings, together with the usually small sample size of studies conducted in the persons of non-European descent, suggest publication bias as one possible explanation for the observed larger genetic effects in Chinese samples. In contrast to <italic>APOE</italic> and <italic>ACE</italic> genes, the results from the <italic>MTHFR</italic> C677T gene variant and stroke risk show an absence of heterogeneity among the different groups of persons of non-European descent studied, as well as between these groups and the genetic effect obtained in samples of persons of European descent &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040131-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;. The robustness of this association reported in the meta-analysis has received further support by a large study &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040131-b063">63</xref>&#x0005d; in the Japanese population, published after our cutoff point for data collection, in which the <italic>MTHFR</italic> C677T gene variant was associated with a similar increase in risk of stroke to the one we report here.</p><p>A descriptive analysis of the most-studied gene variant indicated that with the exception of the <italic>MTHFR</italic> C677T gene variant, summary ORs in persons of non-European descent tend to be higher than those reported in persons of European descent, the effect mainly accounted for by the results in the Chinese population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0040131-g004">Figure 4</xref>). While the results in samples of persons of European descent indicated a null effect of the <italic>APOE</italic> &#x0025b;4 allele on stroke, the pooled OR from studies of Chinese people was substantially higher, and their CIs did not overlap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0040131-g004">Figure 4</xref>). A similar although more attenuated difference between persons of European descent and Japanese was observed. Therefore, it is not surprising that when comparing the pooled results separately for the three groups, substantial heterogeneity was observed (<italic>I</italic><sup>2</sup> &#x0003d; 89.5&#x00025;). Interestingly, the genetic effect observed in the Chinese population was even higher than that observed in other Asian ethnic groups, such as the Japanese population, although some overlap of their CIs remains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0040131-g004">Figure 4</xref>). A similar scenario, although less pronounced, was observed for the <italic>ACE</italic> I/D gene variant, in which studies conducted in the Chinese population showed a higher estimate of the effect than that observed in persons of European descent, which accounted for most of the heterogeneity observed among these ethnic groups (<italic>I</italic><sup>2</sup> &#x0003d; 58.4&#x00025;). In contrast, for the <italic>MTHR</italic> C677T variant, the effect estimate within the groups of non-European descent (Chinese and Koreans), as well as when compared with that in persons of European descent, was homogenous (<italic>I</italic><sup>2</sup> &#x0003d; 0&#x00025;; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0040131-g004">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>Although the existence of genuine genetic heterogeneity in the Chinese population to explain their larger genetic effects is possible, the probable causal reasons to explain this finding may not be always directed toward the same direction (higher risk) for the different candidate genes. Equally likely is that, since association studies conducted in persons of non-European descent are smaller compared to persons of European descent, ethnicity may act as a proxy for the presence of small-study bias, whether it represents publication bias, poorer study quality, or greater random error. Study quality itself is difficult to measure, but heterogeneity forms one aspect of this measurement. Whether the positive gene&#x02013;disease ORs observed here will reduce toward a null effect in very large studies conducted in different ethnic groups remains to be seen. A plausible scenario is that the genetic effect is indeed genuine but lower than it currently appears to be, such as the case of the <italic>MTHFR</italic> C677T, in which the summary OR in persons of non-European descent coincides with the result of the largest genetic association study.</p><p>The larger genetic effect observed in these candidate gene&#x02013;stroke meta-analyses for Chinese studies, despite the smaller sample sizes, is in agreement with a recent systematic review of 13 gene&#x02013;disease associations from a wide variety of complex disorders, in which gene effects in samples from Chinese people tended to be larger than those observed in non-Chinese Asian people, and more accentuated with studies conducted in persons of European descent. An interesting difference with that analysis is the case of the <italic>MTHFR</italic> C677T gene&#x02013;coronary heart disease association in which the authors, in contrast to our findings, also observed a larger genetic effect in Chinese samples &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040131-b064">64</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>We are aware of one previous study that has attempted to address the question of ethnic differences in genetics of a wide variety of complex traits &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040131-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;. These investigators examined the genetic effects for 43 validated gene&#x02013;disease associations across nearly 700 populations of various descents. Large variations in genetic effect sizes by ethnic group arose in only 14&#x00025; of cases, suggesting the genetic markers for gene&#x02013;disease associations may vary across populations, but the biological effects, at least for common diseases, is similar across the traditional ethnic boundaries &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040131-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;. Apart from the unusually large effect in Chinese samples, our results do provide some support to the notion of common, underlying biological causes across different ethnic groups for common disorders such as ischaemic stroke. As genotype frequencies do seem to differ to some extent by ethnic group (e.g., <italic>ACE</italic> I/D in persons of European descent versus Chinese individuals), the impact of similar genetic effects may be different in other ethnic populations.</p><p>Despite our attempt to evaluate the gene effects in all ethnic groups, we were limited by the fact that the vast majority of data in persons of non-European descent came from Chinese, Japanese, and Korean populations. The nature and extent of the genetic contribution to stroke and other multifactorial disorders in groups of differing ancestry should be considered an important endeavour for risk evaluation and primary prevention measure across all populations. First, evaluation of genetic effects across multiple ethnic backgrounds with substantial difference in cultural behaviour may prove to be the best scenario for the study of gene&#x02013;environment interactions. Second, the presence of concordance of gene effects on disease risk, as well as on its effect on the direct intermediate phenotype, are strong tools to reliably identify putative functional variants. Third, since the uses of a genetic approach by using gene variants as tools of common intermediate phenotype is expected to provide great advantage in aetiological research, adequately powered genetic studies may help to unravel aetiological factors for the increasing public health disorders in persons of non-European descent such as stroke, which is rapidly becoming a major cause of mortality in Asia with over 1.6 million deaths in China alone in 2002 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040131-b065">65</xref>&#x0005d;. Certainly, such an enterprise would require extensive international collaboration among investigators in the field, since gene effects on disease are usually small. The emergence of recently established networks such as HuGENet (Human Genome Epidemiology, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.hugenet.org.uk">http://www.hugenet.org.uk</ext-link>) will prove to play an essential role for an adequate study of gene effects in persons of non-European descent &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040131-b066">66</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>As with all meta-analyses based on aggregate data, our results are dependent on published data. Although, as described above, efforts were conducted to limit small-study bias, (the most likely cause of which is publication bias), significant results of the test for small-study bias indicate that this bias has to be carefully considered..In addition, even ethnicity can be a difficult trait to define and sometimes is inconsistently reported in the literature. That the included studies have tended to come from their native countries, should minimize such misclassification. In addition, self-reported ethnic grouping, which is likely to take place in native countries, is known to be very reliable for categorization purposes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040131-b067">67</xref>&#x0005d;. Finally, for some genes our results are based on small numbers of publications, which limits the power of our tests for publication bias and heterogeneity.</p><p>We conclude that genetic associations so far studied for ischaemic stroke among persons of non-European descent are similar to those found for persons of European descent. However, all the published data on persons of non-European descent are largely derived from Chinese, Japanese, and Korean populations. To date, the evidence does not support ethnicity playing a major part in the genetic aetiology of common ischaemic stroke. However, people from a more diverse range of ethnic groups need to be recruited into genetic studies in much greater numbers than is currently the case.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>LS is supported by a Clinician Scientist Fellowship from the Medical Research Council (United Kingdom).
