Physical and chemical agents, however, including ionising radiations and anticancer drugs, may injure endothelial cells determining an increase in oxidative stress and genotoxic damage. Whether the SS protective function remains intact in the presence of strong oxidants or DNA damage is currently unclear.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and Results</title><p>To investigate this aspect a series of experiments were performed in which HUVEC were exposed to sub-lethal doses of the radio-mimetic compound Bleomycin (Bleo; 10 &#x000b5;g/ml) which generated free radicals (ROS) without significantly compromising cell survival. Remarkably, the application of a SS of 12 dyne/cm<sup>2</sup> did not protect endothelial cells but markedly accelerated apoptosis compared to controls kept in static culture and in the presence of Bleo. Experiments with the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) inhibitor GW274150 significantly reduced the SS-dependent apoptosis indicating that the production of NO was relevant for this effect. At molecular level, the ataxia-telangectasia-mutated (ATM) kinase, the homeodomain-interacting protein kinase-2 (HIPK2) and p53 were found activated along a pro-apoptotic signalling pathway while p21<sup>waf1,cip1,sdi1</sup> was prevented from its protective action. RNA interference experiments revealed that HIPK2 and p53 were both important for this process, however, only the forced expression p21<sup>waf1,cip1,sdi1</sup> fully restored the SS-dependent pro-survival function.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study provides the first evidence that, in the presence of genotoxic damage, laminar flow contributes to endothelial toxicity and death and identifies molecular targets potentially relevant in endothelial dysfunction and cardiovascular disease pathogenesis.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Endothelial cells are physiologically exposed to blood flow which exerts pro-survival and anti-proliferative effects aimed at maintaining endothelial and vascular homestasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006603-Bartling1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006603-Shyy1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

Its cytotoxic and mutagenic effects are thought to be related to the ability of introducing both single- and double-stranded DNA breaks and require the presence of specific cofactors such as a transition metal, oxygen and a one-electron reductant important for the production of elevated intracellular levels of ROS<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006603-Das1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006603-Chen1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The mammalians response to DNA damage comprises a highly co-ordinated, yet complex network of proteins that have been categorized as sensors, signal transducers, mediators and effectors of damage and repair. The presence of DNA damage is, in fact, the stimulus to activate a signalling cascade controlled in part by the ataxia-telangectasia mutated (ATM) kinase which phosphorylates the histone isoform 2Ax (&#x003b3;H2Ax) and stabilizes the homeodomain-interacting protein kinase (HIPK2) determining p53 phosphorylation and, according to the extension of damage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006603-Meulmeester1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, its activation along a repair/survival or a pro-apoptotic pathway<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006603-Dauth1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. In this context the role of SS is presently uncertain. Prior reports indicate that SS protects endothelial cells from oxidative stress<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006603-Dimmeler1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006603-Dimmeler2">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref> It is otherwise well known that some of the molecules involved in the SS-dependent signalling are in common with those controlling DNA damage and repair, including p53 and p21<sup>waf1,cip1,sdi1</sup>. Specifically, following DNA damage, p21<sup>waf1,cip1,sdi1</sup> induction is important for the cell cycle arrest, a mandatory step to properly activate the DNA repair machinery. The absence or unscheduled degradation of this molecule, in fact, leads to accumulation of DNA mutations and apoptosis<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006603-Fragkos1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. Hence, in stress condition p21<sup>waf1,cip1,sdi1</sup> regulation and/or availability to the SS-dependent signalling cascade could represent an important event with possible functional consequences on the endothelial cell response to mechanical stimuli.</p><p>In an attempt to identify mediators of SS function during the endothelial cell response we investigated whether laminar flow contributed to the survival of endothelial cell or played a detrimental role in the presence of DNA damage. Our findings indicate that in the presence of Bleo or other genotoxic agents (see supplemental data) which determined DNA damage and ATM-HIPK2-p53 activation, the application of laminar flow caused a significant increase in endothelial cell death. This effect, was paralleled by a significant limitation in p21<sup>waf1,cip1,sdi1</sup> expression which further contributed to endothelial toxicity<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006603-Mattiussi1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In conclusion, this work provides the first evidence that, in the presence of specific molecular cues generated by genotoxic damage, laminar flow loses its protective properties creating additional damaging signals. Further, it determines the crucial and protective role of p21<sup>waf1,cip1,sdi1</sup> against endothelial lethality.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Cell Culture</title><p>HUVEC, human umbelical vein endothelial cells, (Clonetics) were cultured in endothelial cell basal medium (EBM-2, Clonetics) supplemented with an endothelial cell Bullet Kit (Clonetics).

Genotoxic damage generates single and double DNA strand breaks which determine Ataxia-telangectasia mutated kinase (ATM) activation and phosphorylated histone 2AX incorporation (&#x003b3;H2AX) in DNA repair foci. ATM is known to regulate the homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 2 (HIPK2) which participate to the DNA repair process regulating p53 function by Serine 46 phosphorylation and activation along a DNA repair or proapoptotic signalling pathways. The latter regulated by proapoptotic members of the BCL<sub>2</sub> protein family (BAX). In this condition, the SS-and p53-dependent cell cycle inhibitor and anti-apoptotic molecule p21<sup>waf1,cip1,sdi1</sup> (p21) is inhibited contributing to endothelial cell death.
