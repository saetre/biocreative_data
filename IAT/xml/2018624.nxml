Here, we pinpoint a single ATM-phosphorylated residue in 53BP1&#x02014;Ser25&#x02014;that is required for binding of 53BP1 to hPTIP. Binding of phospho-Ser25 to hPTIP <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> requires two closely apposed pairs of BRCT domains at the C-terminus of hPTIP and neither pair alone can bind to phospho-Ser25, even though one of these BRCT pairs in isolation can bind to other ATM-phosphorylated epitopes. Mutations in 53BP1 and in hPTIP that prevent the interaction of the two proteins, render cells hypersensitive to DNA damage and weaken ATM signalling. The C-terminal BRCT domains of hPTIP are also required for stable retention of hPTIP at sites of DNA damage but this appears to be independent of binding to 53BP1. Thus, the BRCT domains of hPTIP play important roles in the cellular response to DNA damage.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>PTIP (Pax2 transactivation domain-interacting protein) is a key regulator of cellular responses to DNA damage that is vitally important for cell and organism function. It was originally identified in mice in a two-hybrid screen with the Pax2 transcription factor that regulates embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). PTIP null embryos do not recapitulate the phenotype of mice lacking Pax2, but instead show very high levels of DNA damage and embryos die at day E8.5 because the DNA damage sustained in S-phase causes a mitotic block (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). These observations suggested that PTIP plays an important role in regulating genome stability.</p><p>Human (h)PTIP is required for survival of cells exposed to ionizing radiation (IR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). hPTIP binds to sites of DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>) and appears to function as an &#x02018;adaptor&#x02019; protein in that it is required for IR-induced phosphorylation of a subset of targets of the ATM (<underline>a</underline>taxia <underline>t</underline>elangiectasia-<underline>m</underline>utated) protein kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). ATM is a key regulator of cellular responses to double-stand breaks (DSBs). Binding of ATM to sites of DNA damage appears to stimulate ATM kinase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>), leading to phosphorylation of target proteins at Ser&#x02013;Gln or Thr&#x02013;Gln (S/T&#x02013;Q) motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5 B6 B7 B8">5&#x02013;8</xref>). For example, ATM, and the related kinase ATR, phosphorylate Ser129 of the core histone variant H2AX at sites of DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9 B10 B11">9&#x02013;11</xref>), and phospho-H2AX in turn acts as a platform for the recruitment of proteins that are needed to signal and repair DNA damage. The MDC1 protein, for example, has a single pair of BRCT domains that bind to phospho-Ser129 of H2AX, thereby recruiting MDC1 and associated proteins to sites of DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). BRCT domains, mostly found in pairs, are small modules of &#x0223c;100 amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>) that mediate protein&#x02013;protein interactions. In some cases these domains recognize phosphorylated epitopes on target proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>).</p><p>hPTIP has a pair of BRCT domains at the N-terminus, and another two pairs at the C-terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). The most extreme C-terminal pair alone was shown <italic>in vitro</italic> to bind to a library of phospho-peptides based on the S/T-Q consensus sequence for phosphorylation by ATM. The optimal sequence bound by this pair of BRCT domains <italic>in vitro</italic> was found to be pS/T-Q-V-F (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). hPTIP was shown to interact with 53BP1 after exposure of cells to IR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). 53BP1 is also an &#x02018;adaptor&#x02019; protein for ATM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>) and mice lacking 53BP1 are tumour prone and are hypersensitive to IR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17 B18 B19">17&#x02013;19</xref>). It was recently shown that 53BP1 is down-regulated in transition from pre-cancerous stage to carcinomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>), and loss of a single 53BP1 allele in mice causes genome instability and lymphoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Cells lacking 53BP1 show mild cell cycle checkpoint defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>) and a pronounced defect in the repair of a subset of DNA breaks by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22 B23 B24">22&#x02013;24</xref>).</p><p>Intriguingly, the interaction of hPTIP and 53BP1 after DNA damage requires ATM-dependent phosphorylation of 53BP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Translocation of these proteins to sites of DNA damage does not require ATM, however, and is therefore independent of their physical association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Although it was implied that binding of a phosphorylated residue in 53BP1 that lies in the pS/T-Q-V-F motif, to the most C-terminal BRCT domain pair in hPTIP explained how these proteins interacted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>), this was not tested. Thus, the mechanism(s) of interaction of hPTIP and 53BP1 or the significance of their interaction for the DNA damage response is not yet known. In this study, we address these questions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cell lines and treatments</title><p>HEK 293 and U2OS cells were grown in DMEM (Gibco BRL) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, HyClone) and penicillin/streptomycin.

The Ser/Thr residues each of these motifs was mutated to alanine and the resulting mutants were transfected into HEK293 cells and tested for interaction with co-transfected with FLAG-hPTIP. Mutation of the 10 most C-terminal S/T-Q motifs in 53BP1 (termed MUT-C10; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A) or mutation of a combination of 17 S/T-Q motifs upstream of the MUT-C10 mutations (termed MUT-N17; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A) did not affect its interaction with hPTIP after exposure of cells to IR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). However, mutation of an additional three residues Ser25, Ser29 and Ser105 (termed MUT-N20), abolished the IR-inducible interaction of 53BP1 with hPTIP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). Whereas mutation of Ser29, Ser105, Ser6 or Ser13, singly had no effect, mutation of Ser25 of 53BP1 abolished the IR-induced interaction of 53BP1 and hPTIP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C and D). Thus, Ser25 in 53BP1 is essential for the interaction of 53BP1 with hPTIP. It was reported previously that 53BP1 is phosphorylated at Ser25 by ATM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Consistent with this, we observed that Ser25 is phosphorylated after exposure of HEK 293 cells to IR, but not in cells pre-incubated with the ATM-specific inhibitor KU55933 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>E). Pre-incubation of cells with NU7441 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>), a specific inhibitor of DNA-dependent protein kinase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>E), or ablation of ATR expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>) (data not shown), did not affect IR-induced phosphorylation of 53BP1 Ser25. The 53BP1 Ser25Ala mutant was retained at sites of DNA damage in a manner indistinguishable from the wild-type protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>F; data not shown). Therefore, the involvement of Ser25 phosphorylation in promoting the interaction of 53BP1 and hPTIP is independent of translocation of 53BP1 to sites of DNA damage. This is consistent with previous reports that ATM is not required for formation of IR-induced nuclear foci by 53BP1 or hPTIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). The data in this section demonstrate that Ser25 that is phosphorylated by ATM is essential for the interaction of 53BP1 with hPTIP after DNA damage and that this is independent of 53BP1 translocation to IR-induced foci.</p></sec><sec><title>Two pairs of hPTIP BRCT domains are required for binding to 53BP1 phospho-Ser25 <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic></title><p>We tested if phosphorylated Ser25 of 53BP1 could bind directly to hPTIP. Two peptides corresponding to the sequence around Ser25, in which Ser25 is phosphorylated or not, were synthesized with a biotin moiety at the N-terminal end. As a test for specificity, a peptide in which nearby Ser29 is phosphorylated, and the Ser25/Ser29 diphospho-peptide, were also synthesized. Peptides were immobilized on streptavidin-coated magnetic beads and incubated with cell extracts. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B, endogenous hPTIP was retrieved by the phospho-Ser25 peptide and phospho-Ser25/phospho-Ser29 peptide but not by the unphosphorylated peptide or the phospho-Ser29 peptide or by an unrelated diphospho-peptide from yeast Rad53. Similar results were obtained with full-length FLAG-hPTIP transfected into cells, and with a transfected fragment of hPTIP (amino acids 590&#x02013;1069) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B), corresponding to the two C-terminal pairs of BRCT domains (pair C1 + pair C2; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A), that we previously showed were necessary and sufficient for hPTIP to interact with 53BP1 after DNA damage in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>).

The <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> values were calculated by fitting the data to the equation <italic>y</italic> = <italic>B</italic><sub>max</sub>&#x000b7;<italic>x</italic>/(<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> + <italic>x</italic>) using GraphPad 4 software, which describes the binding of a ligand to a receptor that follows the law of mass action. <italic>B</italic><sub>max</sub> is the maximal binding and <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> is the concentration of ligand required to reach half-maximal binding, whereas <italic>x</italic> and <italic>y</italic> correspond to the protein concentration and the response units, respectively. (<bold>B</bold>) Same as A., except that binding of hPTIP BRCT domain pair C1, C2 and pair C1 + pair C2 to the 53BP1 phospho-Ser25 peptide was compared.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkm493f3"/></fig></p><p>The requirement for two BRCT domain pairs for recognition of phospho-Ser25 was surprising because in all reported cases of phospho-epitope recognition by BRCT domains, a single pair is sufficient and also because it was reported that the BRCT domain pair C2 of hPTIP alone bound to a library of degenerate pS/T-Q phosphopeptides. The optimal peptide used in these experiments by Yaffe and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>) was biotin-GAAYDI-pSQ-VFPFAKKK. In agreement with these data, even though hPTIP BRCT domain pair C2 did not bind to 53BP1 phospho-Ser25, it bound to this phospho-peptide (termed &#x02018;S-Q-V-F peptide&#x02019;) with a <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> of &#x0223c;273 nM (data not shown), and not to the unphosphorylated version of this peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>D). These data taken together suggest that BRCT pair C1 + C2 of hPTIP are capable two modes of phospho-epitope recognition: one specific for pS-Q-V-F peptides mediated solely by pair C2, and another mode that is responsible for binding phospho-Ser25 that needs both pair C1 + pair C2.</p><p>To confirm the requirement for two separate pairs of BRCT domains in hPTIP to bind phospho-53BP1, the effect of mutation of conserved residues in these domains was determined. Inspection of the amino acid sequence of hPTIP revealed that BRCT domain pair C2 contains a small conserved motif that in other proteins recognizes phospho-peptides. MDC1 and BRCA1 each have a single pair of BRCT domains that interact with phospho-peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Structural analyses showed that Arg1933 of MDC1 and Arg1699 of BRCA1 coordinate phospho-Ser and are essential for phospho-peptide binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). Alignment of each of the two C-terminal pairs of BRCT domains from hPTIP, individually, with the BRCT domain pairs from MDC1 and BRCA1 revealed clear conservation of residues involved in phospho-specific binding in the second pair, but not in the first pair, of hPTIP C-terminal BRCT domains (Figure S1). Arg910 in BRCT pair C2 of hPTIP appears to be equivalent to Arg1699 of BRCA1 and Arg1933 of MDC1 (Figure S1). BiaCore measurements showed that whereas pair C1 + C2 bound to the 53BP1 phospho-Ser25 peptide with a <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> of &#x0223c;526 nM, mutation of Arg910 (R910Q) severely reduced binding of BRCT pair C1 + pair C2 of hPTIP to phospho-Ser25 of 53BP1 so that the <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> was so high that it was difficult to determine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A). Almost all BRCT domains have a conserved Trp on the &#x003b1;3 helix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>) that corresponds to Trp676 in hPTIP BRCT pair C1 and Trp929 in pair C2 (Figure S1). Mutation of either Trp676 (W676A) or Trp929 (W929A) to alanine severely reduced binding to Ser25 phospho-peptide and in each case the <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> was &#x0003e;1000 &#x003bc;M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B, mutation of Trp676, Arg910 or Trp929 abolished binding of hPTIP to 53BP1 in IR-treated cells <italic>in vivo</italic>.

However, the data presented in this study indicate that two hPTIP BRCT pairs are required to bind to phospho-53BP1, and this discrepancy was investigated. Protein fragments corresponding to the hPTIP BRCT domains were expressed as GST fusions in bacteria, immobilized and incubated with extracts of cells exposed, or not, to IR. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C, BRCT Pairs C1 + C2 of hPTIP retrieved 53BP1 from extracts of irradiated cells much more efficiently than from un-irradiated cells. The isolated BRCT pair C2 of BRCT domains also retrieved 53BP1 from extracts of irradiated cells but with much lower efficiency than hPTIP BRCT pairs C1 + C2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C), showing that pair C1 is important. Retrieval of 53BP1 from extracts by GST-hPTIP (590&#x02013;1069) was prevented by mutation of the W676A mutation in pair C1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C). Therefore, BRCT pair C2 of hPTIP only binds very weakly to phospho-53BP1 in cell extracts compared with a combination of both C-terminal pairs of hPTIP BRCT domains. These data are consistent with our previous finding that both C-terminal pairs of hPTIP BRCT domains are necessary and sufficient to interact with 53BP1 in cells after DNA damage <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>The interaction of 53BP1 and hPTIP is not required for recruitment of hPTIP to sites of DNA damage</title><p>We previously showed that both C-terminal pairs of BRCT domains in hPTIP are necessary and sufficient for the formation of nuclear foci by hPTIP after DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Since both these domains in hPTIP are also required for binding to phospho-Ser25 of 53BP1, we investigated if binding of the C-terminal domains of hPTIP is required for stable retention of hPTIP at sites of DNA damage. U2OS cells were transiently transfected with plasmids expressing wild-type FLAG-hPTIP and hPTIP bearing the following mutations: Trp676Ala (W676A), Arg910Gln (R910Q) or Trp929Ala (W929A). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A, formation of foci by endogenous 53BP1 was normal in all irradiated cells: this was used as an internal control for focus formation. Wild-type hPTIP formed nuclear foci after exposure of cells to IR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A): almost all cells had &#x0003e;50 foci under these conditions, whereas most cells had &#x0003c;10 foci in untreated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B). In contrast, mutation of Trp676 or Trp929 prevented focus formation by hPTIP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A); very few cells had &#x0003e;50 foci after IR, and almost all cells had &#x0003c;10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B). Mutation of Arg910 had little effect on the ability of hPTIP to form foci after IR and this mutant was difficult to distinguish from wild-type hPTIP in this regard (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A and B). However, all three of these mutations&#x02014;Trp676Ala, Trp929Ala and Arg910Gln&#x02014;prevent the association of hPTIP with phospho-Ser25 of 53BP1 <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B). Therefore, the two C-terminal BRCT domains of hPTIP are essential for binding to sites of DNA damage but it appears that this is independent of binding to phosphorylated Ser25 of 53BP1. This is consistent with our previous finding that ATM,which catalyses Ser25 phosphorylation, is not required for hPTIP to form nuclear foci after DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). <fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>Interaction of 53BP1 with hPTIP is not required for stable retention of hPTIP at sites of DNA damage.

Transfection of HEK293 cells with a siRNA duplex to silence 53BP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>), but not with a scrambled (SCR) version of this duplex, caused a dramatic reduction in 53BP1 protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A). An assay to allow expression of ectopic HA-tagged 53BP1was then established to allow complementation analysis. This involved making a mutation in (HA-tagged) 53BP1 cDNA on a plasmid at a point (T93) in the target sequence recognized by the siRNA duplex, to render HA-53BP1 refractory to siRNA-mediated silencing. Conditions were established so that HA-53BP1 or HA-53BP1 in which Ser25 was mutated to Ala were expressed at close to endogenous levels, judged by immunoblotting with anti-53BP1 antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A). Immunoprecipitation with anti-HA antibody fully depleted 53BP1 from extracts of cells co-transfected with 53BP1 siRNA and HA-53BP1 (data not shown).

Consistent with these reports, depletion of 53BP1 caused a severe reduction in phosphorylation of Chk2 at Thr68 and phosphorylation of BRCA1 at Ser1524 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A). Whereas wild-type 53BP1 could rescue IR-induced phosphorylation of Chk2 and 53BP1, mutation of Ser25 to Ala prevented this. We next looked at the effect of mutation of Ser25 on cellular resistance to IR. Depletion of 53BP1 rendered cells hypersensitive to IR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B), consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). Treatment of 53BP1-depleted cells with 3 Gy of IR caused an &#x0223c;90% decrease in cell viability, in contrast with an almost 40% decrease in viability in cells treated with a scrambled (SCR) RNA duplex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B). 53BP1 in which Ser25 was mutated to alanine was unable to rescue this defect whereas wild-type 53BP1 restored cellular resistance to IR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B). These data show that Ser25 of 53BP1, that mediates the inducible interaction of 53BP1 with hPTIP, is required for 53BP1 to act as an adaptor protein for ATM and for cellular resistance to DSBs.</p><p>Mutation of Arg910 in hPTIP BRCT pair C2 prevents binding of hPTIP to phospho-Ser25 of 53BP1 <italic>in vitro</italic> and prevents binding of hPTIP to 53BP1after DNA damage in cells, but does not affect hPTIP focus formation. This mutation is therefore useful for probing the consequences of the interaction of hPTIP with 53BP1 phospho-Ser25. hPTIP-specific RNAi was carried out in HEK293 cells and this, like depletion of 53BP1, resulted in a dramatic reduction in the IR-induced phosphorylation of Chk2 at Thr68 and of BRCA1 at Ser1524 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>C). Whereas wild-type FLAG-hPTIP could fully rescue these defects, the Arg910Gln (R910Q) mutant could not. Therefore, Arg910 of hPTIP BRCT pair C2 is required for an intact response to DNA damage. These data strongly suggest that recognition of 53BP1 phospho-Ser25 by the C-terminal BRCT domains of hPTIP is important for maintenance of genome stability.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The data presented above demonstrate that the two pairs of C-terminal BRCT domains of hPTIP are capable of at least two modes of phospho-epitope recognition and that they control at least two important, but independent, facets of hPTIP function: interaction with phosphorylated 53BP1 and translocation to sites of DNA damage.</p><p>At the outset of this study, it was known that hPTIP interacts with 53BP1 after DNA damage in an ATM-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>) but the mechanisms or significance of this interaction were unclear. In this study, we showed that a single ATM-phosphorylated residue in 53BP1&#x02014;Ser25&#x02014;is required for interaction with hPTIP in cells. Mutation of Ser25 did not grossly perturb 53BP1 function since the 53BP1 Ser25Ala mutant protein formed foci after DNA damage in a manner indistinguishable from the wild-type protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>) (data not shown). Phosphorylated Ser25 was shown to interact with the two C-terminal pairs (Pair C1 + C2) of hPTIP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). We found that, surprisingly, both of these BRCT pairs are required to bind to the phospho-Ser25 peptide and neither domain alone could bind to this peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). Consistent with these data, mutations of conserved residues in Pair C1 (Trp676) or in Pair C2 (Arg910 or Trp929) severely reduced binding of hPTIP to phospho-Ser25 <italic>in vitro</italic>. Furthermore, mutation of any of these residues abolished the binding of hPTIP to 53BP1 after DNA damage <italic>in vivo</italic>. This is the first reported example of a requirement of two pairs of BRCT domains for binding to a single phospho-epitope. It is not yet clear why two BRCT pairs are required to recognize 53BP1 phospho-Ser25, especially when in BRCA1 and MDC1 (and in other BRCT-proteins), a single BRCT pair in each case is sufficient for interacting with phospho-H2AX and phospho-BACH1, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). We predict that the small conserved basic patch containing Arg910 in hPTIP pair C2 contacts the phospho-Ser25 of 53BP1 and that pair C1 makes contact with residues nearby, possibly helping to determine the specificity of the interaction. Solving the crystal structure of hPTIP BRCT domain pairs C1 + C2 in complex with the 53BP1 phospho-Ser25 peptide should provide valuable insight into the detailed mechanism of this interaction.</p><p>The requirement for two pairs of BRCT domains for hPTIP to recognize a single phospsho-epitope&#x02014;Ser25 of 53BP1&#x02014;is somewhat surprising since isolated BRCT domain pair C2 of hPTIP was shown previously, in peptide selection experiments, to interact with synthetic phospho-peptides that lie in an pS/T-Q-V-F motif. Ser25 does not lie in this type of motif but there are two serine residues in 53BP1&#x02014;Ser29 and Ser105&#x02014;that do conform to the pS/T-Q-V-F motif, are not required for 53BP1to bind hPTIP after DNA damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C). The observation that hPTIP BRCT pairs C1 + C2 recognize a phospho-peptide different from the pS/T-Q-V-F peptides bound by pair C2 in isolation suggests that there are two modes of phospho-epitope recognition resident in pairs C1 + C2. Again, it would be interesting to compare the crystal structure of hPTIP BRCT pairs C1 + C2 in complex with the two types of phospho-peptide to ascertain whether different modes of interaction are at play. It would be interesting to know if two types of phosphopeptide bind in a mutually exclusive manner or if they can bind to hPTIP simultaneously.</p><p>We showed previously that both BRCT pairs C1 and C2 are required for translocation of hPTIP to sites of DNA damage. In this study, we showed that mutation of Trp676 in hPTIP BRCT pair C1 abolished formation of IR-induced nuclear foci by hPTIP, as did mutation of Trp929 in pair C2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). However, the R910Q mutation that also abolished binding of hPTIP to phospho-Ser25 and to 53BP1 in cells, did not affect formation of nuclear foci by hPTIP after IR. Therefore, both C-terminal pairs of BRCT domains in hPTIP appear to be essential for binding of sites of DNA damage but this appears to be independent of their ability to bind phospho-Ser25 of 53BP1. This is consistent with previous reports that ATM, the Ser25 kinase, is not required for binding of hPTIP or 53BP1 to sites of DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). At present, the molecular mechanisms governing translocation of hPTIP are not clear and this will be interesting to investigate. Whatever the case, it is clear both C-terminal BRCT domains of hPTIP are required.</p><p>Mutation of 53BP1 Ser25, that abolished interaction with hPTIP, and mutation of Arg910 of hPTIP that prevents interaction with phospho-Ser25, prevented phosphorylation of BRCA1 and Chk2 by ATM. Thus, 53BP1 must interact with hPTIP to exercise its role as adaptor and to protect cells against DSBs. At present, it is not clear how 53BP1 or hPTIP functions to assist ATM phosphorylation but may involve recruitment of ATM substrates to sites of DNA damage. Mutation of Ser25 also caused cells to become hypersensitive to IR, probably indicative of a DNA repair defect, since 53BP1 are defective in NHEJ of a subset of DSBs in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). It would be interesting to know if mutation of Ser25 in mice recapitulates the same spectrum of tumours seen in 53BP1 null mice, and if mutation of Ser25 affects immunoglobulin class switching. Neither 53BP1 nor hPTIP appear to have catalytic activity and probably act as &#x02018;scaffolding&#x02019; proteins to recruit and direct &#x02018;effector&#x02019; polypeptides to sites of DNA damage. Ultimately it will be vital to identify the effector molecules that hPTIP and 53BP1 bring to sites of DNA damage that facilitate DNA repair and that enable phosphorylation of ATM targets.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p>Supplementary Data are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Material]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="nar_gkm493_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="ps" xlink:href="nar_gkm493_nar-00884-f-2007-File010.eps"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We are grateful to Drs Yasuhisa Adachi (University of Tokyo, Japan), Junjie Chen (Mayo Clinic, Rochester, USA) and Penny Jeggo (Genome Damage and Stability Centre, University of Sussex) for reagents and advice.
