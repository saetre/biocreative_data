Only a small fraction of DP cells with the appropriate TCR&#x003b1;&#x003b2;/CD3 complex can differentiate into CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD8<sup>&#x02212;</sup> or CD4<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> SP thymocytes. These cells migrate to the peripheral immune organs, spleen and lymph nodes. Early in life, when these organs are relatively empty, homeostatic proliferation of SP cells takes place to fill the empty niches. This homeostatic proliferation ceases in adult mice. Mature T cells exist in the G<sub>0</sub> state of the cell cycle and proliferate only when stimulated through their TCR complex.</p><p>Regardless of their cell types, cell cycle progression in mammalian cells is tightly regulated by the rise and fall of the cyclin/CDK kinase activities. Entry into the S phase requires activation of the CDK4/cyclin D or CDK6/cyclin D and the CDK2/cyclin E activities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009229-Sherr1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009229-Sherr2">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. The latter kinase phosphorylates the Rb family members Rb, p107 and p130, which then release the E2F transcription factors required for cell entry into the S phase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009229-Cobrinik1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009229-Fung1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. In S phase, CDK2/cyclin A is active while cyclin B/CDK1 is crucial for the G<sub>2</sub>/M phases of the cell cycle. FoxM1 belongs to the forkhead family of transcription factors that include Foxp3, Foxo3 and other Fox family proteins crucial for a wide variety of biological processes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009229-Ziegler1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009229-Wierstra1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. FoxM1 is known to be a master regulator of cell cycle proteins that are expressed in proliferating cells. Its known direct target genes include cyclin D1, c-myc, cyclin B1, p27, p21, G<sub>2</sub>/M specific protein survivin and many other cell cycle related proteins. In cell lines and some primary cells, FoxM1 deficient cells fail to proliferate and exhibit aneuploidy and polyploidy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009229-Wierstra1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009229-Laoukili1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref> with many similarities to that of survivin deficient cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009229-Okada1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009229-Xing1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. In adult mice, FoxM1 is highly expressed in the testis, small intestine, colon and thymus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009229-Korver1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009229-Korver2">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. Thymus contains different T-cell populations but only a small fraction is proliferating (DN thymocytes). FoxM1 presumably is expressed in proliferating DN thymocytes but it is also found in DP cells, which constitute &#x0003e;85&#x00025; thymocytes. However, DP thymocytes exist in 2N DNA content and do not proliferate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009229-Xue1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition to FoxM1, DP thymocytes express many cell cycle proteins, including survivin, cyclin A, cyclin B1, cyclin D, CDK2, cdc2, p27, p21 and the RB family members p107, p130. Differentiation of DP thymocytes into SP cells results in down-regulation of FoxM1 as well as other cell cycle proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009229-Xue1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009229-Huang2">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. We hypothesized that expression of these cell cycle genes in DP thymocytes might contribute to their inherent sensitivity to apoptosis. As FoxM1 is a master cell cycle gene for many cell cycle proteins, we deleted FoxM1 from DP thymocytes by crossing floxed FoxM1 mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009229-Zhao1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref> to two different T cell specific Cre transgenic mice (<italic>lck-Cre</italic> and <italic>CD4-Cre</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009229-Hennet1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009229-Lee1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. Analysis of <italic>lck-Cre/FoxM1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice showed that deletion of FoxM1 starting from DN thymocytes results in a 2-fold drop of the DP thymocyte population followed by a similar drop of mature peripheral T cells. In contrast, T cell development appears to be normal in <italic>CD4-Cre/FoxM1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice although mature T cells exhibit defective proliferation when stimulated. Interestingly, expression of a few cell cycle proteins is affected in FoxM1-deficient DP thymocytes. Apoptosis of FoxM1-deficient DP cells appears to be normal.

Deletion of FoxM1 is thus expected to occur before the pre-TCR mediated proliferation that takes place between DN3 (CD4<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD8<sup>&#x02212;</sup> CD25<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD44<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>) and DN4 (CD4<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD8<sup>&#x02212;</sup> CD25<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD44<sup>&#x02212;</sup>) T cells. In a similar knockout mouse strain of survivin gene (<italic>lck-Cre/survivin<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>), for example, loss of survivin at this stage leads to a severe block in the DN to DP transition and more than 10-fold drop of the number of thymocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009229-Okada1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009229-Xing1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Unexpectedly, however, lck-FoxM1 mice only exhibit a two-fold reduction in the number of total thymocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009229-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). The number of DN thymocytes remains similar and reduction starts in intermediated single positive (TCR<sup>low</sup> CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD4<sup>&#x02212;</sup>) thymocytes (1.5 fold) followed by a 2-fold drop of DP thymocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009229-g001">Fig. 1A, 1B</xref> and data not shown). Positive selection (differentiation into CD4 or CD8 SP thymocytes) doesn't seem to be affected as the expression profiles of markers for positive selection, CD69 and HSA, are normal (data not shown). The CD25/CD44 staining profiles of DN thymocytes confirmed that loss of FoxM1 leads to accumulation of the DN3 thymocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009229-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). Loss of FoxM1 in DP thymocytes and later T cell stages was confirmed using western blot analysis (see below). Analysis of the peripheral immune organs, spleen and lymph nodes also showed a similar modest drop of CD4 and CD8 mature T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009229-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>). We concluded that the absence of FoxM1 early during T cell development only modestly affects the transition of DN to DP T cells and has no effect in later stages of T cell differentiation.</p><fig id="pone-0009229-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0009229.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Characterization of lck-FoxM1 mice.</title><p>(A) The total number of thymocytes, double negative (DN) cells, and double positive (DP) cells from each mouse are depicted as a box or a circle (<italic>n</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;9).

To see if this is the case, we isolated cell extracts from sorted DP thymocytes, purified na&#x000ef;ve T cells and activated mature T cells. Western blot analysis was then carried out using antibodies specific for each individual cell cycle protein. As we reported previously, DP thymocytes express many cell cycle proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009229-Xue1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. Expression of these proteins is extinguished following positive selection but is re-activated when mature T cells are stimulated to undergo proliferation. In DP cells of lck-FoxM1 mice, only residual FoxM1 protein was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009229-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). In contrast, the level of FoxM1 was reduced but not eliminated in DP cells of CD4-FoxM1 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009229-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>), presumably due to the long half-life of the FoxM1 protein. Activated T cells from both lines of mice had undetectable levels of FoxM1. The difference in FoxM1 protein levels between these two strains of mice is likely due to the differential kinetics of FoxM1 deletion during T cell development. Consistent with the earlier reports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009229-Xing1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009229-Lee1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, semi-quantitative PCR analysis of the deleted and wild-type FoxM1 alleles from lck- and CD4-FoxM1 mice showed higher levels of FoxM1 deletion in DN3 and DN4 thymocyte populations of lck-FoxM1 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009229-g004">Fig. 4D</xref>). Surprisingly, survivin levels were largely unchanged in DP cells and activated T cells of both lck-FoxM1 and CD4-FoxM1 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009229-g004">Fig. 4A, B</xref>). This is different to what others have found in FoxM1 knockdown cell lines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009229-Wang2">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. A small reduction of survivin level could be consistently seen in na&#x000ef;ve mature T cells of CD4-FoxM1 mice. However, since FoxM1 is normally not expressed in na&#x000ef;ve T cells, this reduction is most likely due to an indirect effect of FoxM1 deficiency. As expected, cyclin B1 level was severely impacted by loss of FoxM1 in DP and activated T cells of lck-FoxM1 mice. It was reduced in DP and activated T cells from CD4-FoxM1 mice. No other cell cycle proteins examined so far were affected in DP thymocytes of lck-FoxM1 or CD4-FoxM1 mice.

In contrast to thymocytes, TCR stimulated FoxM1-deficient mature T cells had lower or very little expression of p107, cdc2, cyclin A and cdk2 compared to their wild-type controls. FoxM1-deficient naive T cells also expressed lower levels of p27 and p130 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009229-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>).

In cell lines and several primary tissues, FoxM1 was shown to directly regulate many cell cycle-specific genes, including the G<sub>1</sub>/S specific genes (cyclin D1, Skp2 and Cks1), the S phase-specific gene c-myc, the G<sub>2</sub>/M genes (cdc25B and cyclin B1) and those that are involved in mitosis (aurora, survivin and CENP) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009229-Wierstra1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. During T cell development, FoxM1 is expressed at a high level in DP thymocytes and proliferating DN thymocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009229-Korver1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009229-Korver2">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. The expression level of FoxM1 is down-regulated as DP cells differentiate into CD4 or CD8 SP T cells. FoxM1 is undetectable in na&#x000ef;ve T cells but is re-expressed when mature T cells are activated to proliferate through their TCR. We are interested in understanding why DP thymocytes are not proliferating but they express many cell cycle proteins, including FoxM1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009229-Xue1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009229-Huang2">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. DP thymocytes are exquisitely sensitive to apoptosis. We hypothesize that the sensitivity to apoptosis is due to the widespread expression of cell cycle proteins. We'd thus like to see if loss of FoxM1 might lead to global down-regulation of cell cycle activities in DP thymocytes and resistance to apoptosis.</p><p>We have generated and analyzed two lines of T-cell specific FoxM1 deficient mice. In lck-FoxM1 mice, the FoxM1 exons (exon 4&#x02013;7) were deleted at the early DN stage and this occured at a higher efficiency than CD4-FoxM1 mice. Reduction of FoxM1 protein is fairly complete by the time thymocytes differentiate into CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DP cells. Loss of FoxM1 at the early stage in lck-FoxM1 mice affects DN to DP transition, resulting in a two-fold drop of the DP thymocytes followed by a similar reduction of SP thymocytes and mature T cells. This modest phenotype is different from that of <italic>lck-Cre/survivin<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice, which suffer from an almost complete block of DN to DP development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009229-Xing1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Residual survivin protein could also be seen in DP thymocytes of <italic>lck-Cre/survivin<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice. The difference in the requirement of survivin versus FoxM1 in early T cell development could be due to an unknown regulator that compensates for the loss of FoxM1 in early T cells. Alternatively, FoxM1 protein might be more stable than survivin and thus there is just enough protein for DN to undergo proliferation despite deletion of their FoxM1 alleles.</p><p>Surprisingly, loss of FoxM1 has no effect on most of the cell cycle proteins expressed in DP thymocytes. DP thymocytes are an unusual group of cells. They do not proliferate but yet they express all the cell cycle proteins examined to date <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009229-Xue1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009229-Pellicciari1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. These include FoxM1, survivin, cyclin B1, cyclin A, cdc2, cdk2, cyclin E, p21, p27 and the Rb family members Rb, p107 and p130. Intracellular staining studies with antibodies against a few of these proteins showed that their expression is not restricted to a subgroup of DP cells but in all DP cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009229-Xue1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. As DP cells mature into SP thymocytes, expression of these proteins is extinguished. Down-regulation can also be seen at the transcription levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009229-Huang2">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. Given the role of FoxM1 as a master cell cycle regulator in other cell types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009229-Zhao1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009229-Wang2">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009229-Laoukili2">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>, including mature T cells (this report), it is surprising to see that cyclin B1 is the only protein whose expression is being affected in FoxM1-deficient DP thymocytes. No changes were found for p107, cdc2, p21, cyclin A, cdk2, p130, p27 or survivin levels. As cyclin B1 is affected, it is unlikely that the residual FoxM1 protein can be responsible for the normal expression levels of these other cell cycle genes. One possibility is the presence of yet another master regulator that compensates for the loss of FoxM1.</p><p>The lack of effect of FoxM1 deficiency on survivin levels is surprising. Survivin has been shown to be a direct target of FoxM1 in cell lines and in primary colon cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009229-Wang2">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009229-Radhakrishnan1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009229-Yoshida1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. Even in activated mature T cells where many of the cell cycle proteins are being affected by FoxM1, survivin protein could be detected at a significant level. It is possible that transcriptional regulation of survivin by FoxM1 is cell type dependent. Further research will be necessary to identify the upstream regulator of survivin in T cells and to understand the molecular mechanisms that regulate cell cycle levels in DP thymocytes.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>All animals were handled in strict accordance with good animal practice as defined by the relevant national and/or local animal welfare bodies, and all animal work was approved by the campus Animal Care and Use Committee.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>FoxM1 Knockout Mice</title><p>T-cell conditional FoxM1 knockout mice were generated by crossing <italic>FoxM1<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic> mice to <italic>Lck-Cre</italic> or <italic>CD4-Cre</italic> transgenic mice, which express Cre recombinase at different DN stages.
