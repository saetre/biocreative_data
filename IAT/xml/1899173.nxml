Target derived diffusible factors are known to control the outgrowth and branching of growing axons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. In <italic>Xenopus</italic>, the mandibular trigeminal nerve extends as fasciculated neurites for a visibly long distance toward the anterior facial epithelium, where in the vicinity of the cement gland, trigeminal axons turn ventrally, arborise and grow into the ventral posterior domain of the cement gland [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The cement gland is a transient embryonic tissue, made up of highly pigmented, mucous secreting cells. These cells transmit mechanosensory information via pressure sensitive receptors in trigeminal axon terminals to activate tonic inhibition response in the swimming tadpole [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Honore and Brivanlou have previously demonstrated that the surgical deletion of cement glands from <italic>Xenopus </italic>embryos resulted in mandibular trigeminal nerve targeting error, and proposed that a cement gland-derived chemoattractive signal operates from a short distance to control the branching and growth of mandibular trigeminal axons to the cement gland [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>It is well known in co-culture experiments that directed outgrowth of trigeminal axons could be stimulated by tissue derived chemoattractants, termed Maxillary Factor from target maxillary/mandibular tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. It has since been demonstrated that Maxillary Factor comprises the neurotrophins BDNF and NT3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Neurotrophins are a family of secreted ligands, including NGF, BDNF, NT3 and NT4 that bind to designate Trk receptors in the nervous system to promote neuronal survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Previous studies showed that mice deficient in BDNF or NT3 displayed a profound loss of sensory neuron populations in the trigeminal ganglia and spinal cord, and die shortly after birth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Furthermore, these mice did not exhibit any defect in the projection of trigeminal axons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. However, it remained unclear whether target-derived neurotrophins might function locally to promote the end stage targeting of trigeminal axons <italic>in vivo</italic>. In <italic>in vitro </italic>growth cone turning assays, growth cones from isolated spinal cord neurons could orient toward a directional gradient of neurotrophins emanating from a micropipette [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Moreover, regional overexpression of neurotrophins in the <italic>Xenopus </italic>central nervous system could promote localised growth and branching from neurotrophin responsive axons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Additionally, neurotrophins when applied ectopically in mammalian slice cultures can promote sensory axon outgrowth from the spinal cord into the periphery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Since the cement gland is a well-defined target for mandibular trigeminal axons, <italic>Xenopus </italic>might provide a useful model for the analysis of neurotrophin function in axon-target interaction <italic>in vivo</italic>. Recently it has been demonstrated that TrkB, the receptor for BDNF and NT3 is highly expressed by trigeminal and spinal sensory neurons in <italic>Xenopus </italic>embryos, which suggests that neurotrophins might play a role in peripheral sensory axon development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Here we determine whether the <italic>Xenopus </italic>cement gland expresses neurotrophins, and focus on the role of BDNF during mandibular trigeminal axon target innervation <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Expression of BDNF in the <italic>Xenopus </italic>cement gland during mandibular trigeminal axon development</title><p>The mandibular trigeminal nerve is a prominent cranial nerve that innervates the <italic>Xenopus </italic>cement gland (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). During development, it exits and projects from the trigeminal ganglion as fasciculated neurites towards the cement gland. Once near the cement gland, the axons extend ventrally and then enter the ventral domain of the cement gland as branched fibers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). To confirm the presence of local axon targeting signals in the cement gland, we repeated Honore and Brivanlou's experiment of surgically deleting the cement gland in developing embryos at St. 18, and analysed mandibular trigeminal nerve morphology at St. 29, the stage of axon target innervation by whole mount immunostaining. Consistent with their observation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], we detected the disruption of mandibular trigeminal nerve targeting in embryos lacking the cement gland (n = 10). Without intact cement glands, mandibular trigeminal nerves extended normally to the anterior facial epithelium, but then either stopped before the site of cement gland deletion (30%; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>), grew away to the dorsal facial epithelium (20%) or to the ventral epithelium (50%; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>). Furthermore, most of the axons remained fasciculated and axon terminals did not arborise. This observation suggests that the cement gland is likely to provide a short range signal to promote the end stage targeting of mandibular trigeminal axons by stimulating branching and growth into the ventral domain of the cement gland.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold><italic>Xenopus </italic>mandibular trigeminal nerve innervates the cement gland</bold>. (A) Whole mount immunostaining of a <italic>Xenopus </italic>embryo (St. 29) labeled with &#x003b2;-tubulin antibody and cleared in Murray's clearing solution reveals the embryonic axonal network, including the prominent mandibular trigeminal nerve. (B) The mandibular trigeminal nerve (arrow) extends between the eye vesicle (e) and otic vesicle (ov), and then turns ventrally before terminating at the ventral region of the cement gland (asterisk). Deletion of cement glands results in the loss of trigeminal targeting, where the axons either (C) stop growth, or extended (D) dorsally or (E) ventrally. Because the embryos are transparent, trigeminal axons on the opposite side could also be detected. In the cement gland null embryos, trigeminal axons on either side of the face do not necessarily project erroneously in the same directions.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-213X-7-59-1"/></fig><p>Given that neurotrophins have been suggested to mediate mammalian peripheral trigeminal axon outgrowth <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], we asked when and where neurotrophins are expressed in <italic>Xenopus </italic>embryos. We found that BDNF, NT3 and NT4 are expressed in early developing embryos (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). Additionally, their expression increased at St. 18 during the period of primary neuronal development, and appeared to remain constant throughout all of the subsequent developmental stages examined. During development, the <italic>Xenopus </italic>mandibular trigeminal axons grow out toward the cement gland at St. 24 and terminate at the cement gland by St. 29 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. When we examined the expression of neurotrophins in cement glands of St. 24 embryos, we found that the cement gland is enriched in BDNF mRNA, compared to NT3 and NT4 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). By whole mount <italic>in situ </italic>hybridisation we detected BDNF mRNA at the neural plate in neurula stage embryos (St. 18) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>), and in the posterior region of the cement gland in tailbud stage embryos at St. 24 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref>) and St. 29 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>).

We then obtained the genomic sequence of BDNF and designed a MO (MO BDNFatg) against a 24 nucleotide sequence in the 5' region of XtBDNF mRNA, including the start codon (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). This region is 100% conserved between <italic>Xenopus laevis </italic>and <italic>Xenopus tropicalis </italic>BDNF.

The HA tag was added to the C-terminus of XtBDNF (BDNF-HA), and the region surrounding the start of translation was not altered. When the BDNF-HA RNA was injected alone in <italic>X. laevis </italic>embryos, a specific band at 34 kDa was detected by Western blot analysis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>, arrowhead). However, the expression of BDNF-HA was completely inhibited by co-injection of MO BDNFatg. As control, we used an oligonucleotide designed against the <italic>X. tropicalis </italic>Sprouty2 gene, containing 4 mismatch nucleotides (MOC), which has previously been shown not to affect <italic>Xenopus </italic>development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. We found that MOC had no effect on the translational efficiency of the HA-tagged BDNF construct (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). This showed that the BDNF MO was highly effective in knocking down BDNF translation.</p><p>To examine the effects of BDNF knockdown on axon development, we injected MOs into <italic>X. laevis</italic>, and <italic>X. tropicalis </italic>embryos. We found that all of the MO BDNFatg injected embryos (n = 68 <italic>X. tropicalis</italic>, n = 30 <italic>X. laevis</italic>) developed without visible morphological abnormalities up to the early tailbud stage (St. 24). These animals were similar in appearance to uninjected embryos (n = 56 <italic>X. tropicalis</italic>, n = 50 <italic>X. laevis</italic>) and MOC embryos (n = 22 <italic>X. tropicalis</italic>, n = 15 <italic>X. laevis</italic>). At St. 28/29, both <italic>X. laevis </italic>and <italic>X. tropicalis </italic>injected with MO BDNFatg appeared slightly truncated in appearance (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E</xref>) compared to uninjected (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>) and control MOC injected embryos (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>). At St. 29, <italic>Xenopus </italic>embryos normally twitch and escape if lightly touched with an object (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3F</xref>). Compared to uninjected and control MOC injected embryos which exhibit normal mechanosensory reflex (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>), we observed that the BDNF morphants appeared paralysed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3G</xref> and Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>). Despite the lack of visible sensory reflex, the morphants continued to develop until the hatching stage (St. 32). These results show that BDNF knockdown results in consistent phenotype and behaviour in both <italic>X. tropicalis </italic>and <italic>X. laevis </italic>embryos.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis of mandibular trigeminal axon targeting after BDNF knockdown</title><p>We next determined if mandibular trigeminal axon outgrowth was disrupted in MO BDNFatg injected embryos at St. 29. The <italic>X. tropicalis </italic>embryos used in our experiment were obtained from sibling mating of a recently generated transgenic line which expresses human placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP) under the control of the neuronal specific &#x003b2;-tubulin promoter. The advantage in using this line is that PLAP is a heat stable and histochemically detectable enzyme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], which enables the rapid detection of axonal projections <italic>in situ </italic>in whole embryos by a simple alkaline phosphatase (AP) reaction at any stage of development (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). In uninjected embryos (n = 23), normal projection of mandibular trigeminal axons was observed, where fasciculated axons extended to the target tissue and then turned ventrally toward the ventral domain of the cement gland (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). In MOC embryos (n = 16), as well as in MO NT3 injected embryos (n = 25), projection of mandibular trigeminal axons also appeared normal (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E</xref>). In MO BDNFatg injected embryos (77.8%, n = 18), the majority of mandibular trigeminal axon appeared to project straight to the cement gland area, and did not turn toward the ventral domain of the cement gland, where they normally innervate (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4F</xref>). Additionally, premature axon defasciculation was occasionally observed among the morphants (28.6%).</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>MO BDNFatg injected into N-PLAP transgenic <italic>X. tropicalis </italic>embryos exhibit possible disruption in mandibular trigeminal axon targeting</bold>.

To examine in detail whether trigeminal axons terminated into cement glands of BDNF morphants, we performed whole mount immunostaining by using antibody against acetylated &#x003b1;-tubulin on MO injected embryos. At St. 29 the embryos were analysed by scanning confocal microscopy. In uninjected (n = 14; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A, B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>) and MOC injected embryos, we observed that the trigeminal axon terminals arborised and entered the ventral cement gland (n = 13; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D, E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5F</xref>; Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). However, in MO BDNFatg injected embryos (n = 25), we observed that most trigeminal axon terminals remained fasciculated and did not arborise or grow into the cement gland (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5G, H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5I</xref>). Axonal arborisation was only detected in 16% of the morphants. This observation demonstrates that BDNF expression is necessary for trigeminal axon target innervation at the cement gland.

To address this issue, we performed a whole mount TUNEL staining to assess cell death activity in BDNF morphants. We found that the number of cells undergoing cell death in the head region of BDNF morphants (n = 10) was comparable to those observed in uninjected embryos (n = 10) during the period of mandibular trigeminal axon targeting into the cement gland (St. 27) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A, B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6E</xref>). At hatching stage (St. 32), we detected at least a 3 fold increase in cell death activity of BDNF morphants (n = 10) compared to uninjected embryos (n = 10), which is 12 hours after mandibular trigeminal axons should have terminated into the cement gland (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C, D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6E</xref>). The disruption of mandibular trigeminal axon targeting in BDNF morphants was therefore likely due to the loss of BDNF signalling and independent from cell death activities.</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>Increased apoptosis observed in the head region of BDNF morphants</bold>.

Experimental deletion of the cement gland causes the failure of mandibular trigeminal nerve targeting (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C, D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>). A previous study showed that target innervation can be "rescued" by substituting the cement gland with an ectodermal animal cap explant expressing follistatin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. We asked if ectodermal animal cap grafts expressing BDNF when positioned in place of cement glands, could prevent trigeminal axon targeting error by stimulating local axon arborisation and growth into the grafts. <italic>In vitro </italic>transcribed mRNAs expressing either green fluorescent protein (GFP), or BDNF and GFP, were first injected into both blastomeres of <italic>Xenopus </italic>embryos at the 2-cell stage. At blastula stage (St. 8), ectodermal animal cap explants were excised and grafted onto a set of uninjected embryos at the late neurula stage (St. 18/19), which had their cement glands removed. At this stage, trigeminal ganglia have not projected their axons. The grafted embryos were then allowed to heal and develop until the late tailbud stage (St. 29). Embryos that contained intact grafts and GFP reporter expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>) were further analysed for trigeminal axon targeting by whole mount immunostaining with an antibody against &#x003b2;-tubulin. We found that the GFP expressed grafts did not prevent trigeminal axon targeting error in <italic>Xenopus </italic>embryos, as the axons either stopped short of the target (22%), extended dorsally toward the eye (33%), or ventrally toward the heart (45%) (n = 9; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C</xref> and Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>). Furthermore, none of the grafts promoted visible axon terminal arborisation or growth into the graft. This observation was similar to that observed when cement glands were experimentally deleted (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C, D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref> and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]). Moreover, this result also demonstrates that secreted factors that might normally be expressed by animal cap cells do not influence or have a direct effect on trigeminal axon targeting. We also tested the possibility for NT3 expressed grafts to promote trigeminal axon targeting (n = 11) by performing the same assay, but found that NT3 was unable to significantly stimulate axon arborisation or growth into the graft (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7D</xref> and Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>). However, when we examined embryos containing BDNF expressed grafts, we found that the grafts promoted axon arborisation at the grafts in 82% of the embryos (n = 17; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7E</xref> and Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>). This suggests that peripheral expression of BDNF could stimulate axon arborisation towards the site of its expression. Furthermore, this observation demonstrates that BDNF acts locally on trigeminal axons because the axons remained fasciculated during their projection, and target induced branching was only observed at the grafts.</p><fig position="float" id="F7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p><bold>BDNF expressed ectodermal animal cap grafts stimulate mandibular trigeminal axon arborisation</bold>.

To address this, we performed an "<italic>in vivo </italic>cement gland swap" experiment by swapping cement glands between uninjected embryos and morpholino injected embryos at St.18/19 and then analysed mandibular trigeminal axon targeting at St. 29 by scanning confocal microscopy. First, we examined cement gland swaps between uninjected and MOC injected embryos. We found that MOC injected cement glands grafted onto wildtype embryos did not perturb mandibular trigeminal axon targeting, as the axons were able to arborise and grow into the cement gland grafts (72% arborisation, n = 7; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).

This observation was similar to that observed in MO BDNFatg injected embryos, and further demonstrates that the failure of axon arborisation at the cement gland in BDNF morphants was specific to BDNF knockdown in the cement gland and not due to a general effect elsewhere in the embryo. Furthermore, we found that wildtype cement glands, when grafted onto MO BDNFatg injected embryos, were able to rescue trigeminal axon target innervation from BDNF deficient embryos by promoting axon arborisation and growth into the grafted cement gland (79% arborisation, n = 14; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8D</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). This demonstrates that trigeminal axon terminals in BDNF morphants remained responsive to target recognition signals from the cement gland.

There are several advantages in using <italic>Xenopus </italic>to study the roles of BDNF on axon targeting. The <italic>Xenopus </italic>mandibular trigeminal nerve and its target, the cement gland, provide a simple and useful <italic>in vivo </italic>system to examine the molecular basis of axon-target interaction in vertebrates. <italic>Xenopus </italic>is an excellent model for embryological studies due to the advantage of its rapid external development, and ability for micromanipulations, grafting and explant cultures.

By using these techniques, we showed that BDNF expression in the <italic>Xenopus </italic>cement gland functioned to locally promote end stage target innervation of mandibular trigeminal axons <italic>in vivo</italic>. Furthermore, because the developmental staging in <italic>Xenopus </italic>embryos is well characterised, we were able to precisely separate the effect of BDNF on target innervation from its effect on neuronal survival by analyzing distinct developmental time points.</p></sec><sec><title>BDNF is a short-range signal to locally stimulate mandibular trigeminal axon arborisation and target innervation</title><p>We found that BDNF knockdown did not affect the overall projection of mandibular trigeminal axons, but prevented their arborised growth into the target cement gland. Our data suggest that BDNF expressed at and near the cement gland functions to promote changes in axonal morphology necessary for trigeminal axon arborisation and growth into the cement gland. In the absence of BDNF, trigeminal neurons fail to arborise and enter the cement gland. By performing cement gland swapping experiments between control and experimental knockdown embryos, we were able to show that BDNF expression is required locally within the cement gland for terminal arborisation of the trigeminal nerves into the cement gland. Finally, transplantation of tissue overexpressing BDNF near the trigeminal nerve results in excessive branching and growth of the nerves into the BDNF expressing transplant, suggesting that BDNF is an important component of the local trigeminal nerve targeting signal, proposed by Honore and Brivanlou [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. This finding is consistent with the findings of Nosrat and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] and Albers and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], who have shown that ectopic overexpression of BDNF in mice can lead to aberrant branching and sprouting of axons at the mammalian tongue.</p><p>In <italic>Xenopus </italic>embryos, trigeminal and spinal sensory neurons express TrkB during development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. BDNF is known to bind to the receptor tyrosine kinase TrkB, which activates several downstream signalling cascades, including the Ras-Mek-Erk and the PI3K/AKT pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Activation of TrkB signalling might trigger local changes in actin cytoskeleton polymerisation within growth cones to promote arborisation of trigeminal axons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. BDNF can also bind to the low-affinity neurotrophin receptor p75NTR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. p75NTR plays a very important role in sensory neuron survival, outgrowth and innervation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], and can function in conjunction with or independently of Trk receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. It is thought that the specificity of TrkB activation by BDNF increases in the presence of p75NTR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. It is possible that at the cement gland, BDNF binds to both TrkB and p75NTR on the growth cone to promote mandibular trigeminal axon innervation and survival.</p></sec><sec><title>Possible involvement of other neurotrophins during mandibular trigeminal axon outgrowth</title><p>We detected the expression of other neurotrophins NT3 and NT4 in the cement gland, although their expression level was not enriched there, compared to BDNF. In mammalian <italic>in vitro </italic>axon outgrowth assays, NT3 was suggested as the dominant neurotrophin that stimulates axon outgrowth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. It remains possible that NT3 and NT4 might also play a role in mandibular trigeminal axon development in <italic>Xenopus</italic>. However we tested the effect of NT3 on mandibular trigeminal axon targeting by using the <italic>in vivo </italic>cement gland graft experiment, and found that NT3 did not appear to stimulate visible arborisation or target innervation. We also tested NT3 MO in <italic>Xenopus</italic>, and found that it did not have a major effect on trigeminal axon targeting at the stages we examined (St.29), and the embryos were not paralysed (See Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5</xref>). In contrast, mandibular trigeminal axons rarely arborised or entered cement glands where BDNF expression was knocked down, therefore BDNF appears to be the dominant local signal that promotes local axon arborisation at the cement gland. We did, however, observe occasional arborisation at the cement gland in some BDNF morphants (16%). It is possible that the occasional arborisation was caused by other signals, or by low level BDNF expression from incomplete BDNF knockdown at the cement gland. The nerve growth factor, NGF, is known to stimulate axon outgrowth from avian and mammalian trigeminal neurons in culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. However, NGF is not likely to stimulate mandibular trigeminal axon innervation in <italic>Xenopus </italic>embryos, as neurons isolated during the stages when trigeminal nerves innervate the cement gland are not responsive to NGF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], and do not express the NGF receptor TrkA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Nevertheless we cannot exclude a role for NGF in later stage maintenance of trigeminal neurons, as NGF is known to be expressed in the nervous system in later stage tadpoles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Another neurotrophin family member, glial derived neurotrophic factor, GDNF has also been suggested to play a role in the outgrowth and maintenance of peripheral trigeminal axons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Recently, GDNF was isolated in <italic>Xenopus </italic>and shown to be expressed in the maxillary facial region of <italic>Xenopus </italic>embryos during development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. But it does not appear to be expressed in the cement gland. It is possible that GDNF does not regulate target innervation, but plays a role in the guidance or maintenance of mandibular trigeminal axons.</p></sec><sec><title>BDNF mediated target innervation might be necessary for mechanosensory function</title><p>We also found that all of the BDNF morphants appeared paralysed.

Neurotrophins and their receptors have been suggested to play a role in the development of cutaneous mechanoreceptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>].
