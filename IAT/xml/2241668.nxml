Many laboratories were not able to detect the presence of cannabinoid CB2 receptors (CB2-Rs) in healthy brains, but there has been demonstration of CB2-R expression in rat microglial cells and other brain associated cells during inflammation. Therefore, neuronal expression of CB2-Rs had been ambiguous and controversial and its role in depression and substance abuse is unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>In this study we tested the hypothesis that genetic variants of <italic>CB2</italic> gene might be associated with depression in a human population and that alteration in <italic>CB2</italic> gene expression may be involved in the effects of abused substances including opiates, cocaine and ethanol in rodents. Here we demonstrate that a high incidence of (Q63R) but not (H316Y) polymorphism in the <italic>CB2</italic> gene was found in Japanese depressed subjects. CB2-Rs and their gene transcripts are expressed in the brains of na&#x000ef;ve mice and are modulated following exposure to stressors and administration of abused drugs. Mice that developed alcohol preference had reduced <italic>CB2</italic> gene expression and chronic treatment with JWH015 a putative CB2-R agonist, enhanced alcohol consumption in stressed but not in control mice. The direct intracerebroventricular microinjection of CB2 anti-sense oligonucleotide into the mouse brain reduced mouse aversions in the plus-maze test, indicating the functional presence of CB2-Rs in the brain that modifies behavior. We report for the using electron microscopy the sub cellular localization of CB2-Rs that are mainly on post-synaptic elements in rodent brain.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>Our data demonstrate the functional expression of CB2-Rs in brain that may provide novel targets for the effects of cannabinoids in depression and substance abuse disorders beyond neuro-immunocannabinoid activity.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Drug addiction and major depression are mental health problems associated with stressful events in life with high relapse and reoccurrence even after treatment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001640-Degenhardt1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

This hypothesis is supported by the identification of a missense polymorphism at <italic>CB2</italic> cDNA position 188&#x02013;189, which results in a dinucleotide conversion of AA to GG and predicts a non conservative amino acid substitution of glutamine by arginine at position 63 (Q63R).

If this can be generalized to other ethnicities, then the results support the possibility of targeting the cannabinoid system using CB2-R ligands in depression and drug abuse and perhaps in their co-morbidity. It is therefore tempting to speculate that the reported effects of alcohol may be associated with changes in the cannabinoid system, with CB2-Rs playing a regulatory role.</p><p>We then hypothesized that if CB2-Rs are present in the brain, then antisense oligonucleotides complementary to <italic>CB2</italic> mRNA transcript will block translation of or stimulate degradation of <italic>CB2</italic> mRNA.

This behavioral evidence for the functional presence of CB2-Rs in brain was further investigated by the exogenous administration of CB2-R agonists and antagonist. The behavioral effects of acute treatment with JWH015, a CB2-R agonist and SR144528, a CB2-R antagonist, in mouse spontaneous locomotor activities, and in the two- compartment black and white box lends further support that CB2-Rs in the brain modifies behavior.

In some areas axon terminals were not immunoreactive for CB2-Rs and small rounded synaptic vesicles were seen. An axon terminal making contact with a dendrite but without immunostaining for CB2-Rs was apparent. The pattern of staining in most hippocampal areas appears to be mainly post-synaptic localization of CB2-Rs. For example at the area of the synaptic contacts seen the synapse appear to be excitatory and possibly glutamatergic. We cannot exclude that some of the CB2-Rs may be presynaptic, just like CB1-Rs are not exclusively presynaptic in the brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001640-Pickel1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. CB1-Rs are known to be mainly presynaptic in the CNS where cannabinoids act at presynaptic CB1-Rs and endocannabinoids have emerged as one of the classes of retrograde messengers involved in the regulation of synaptic transmission. The functional implication of pre- and/or post-synaptic localization of CB2-Rs awaits further electrophysiological investigation and image analysis of this interesting component of the EPCS. The current understanding of CNS CB2-Rs was the subject of our review <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001640-Onaivi2">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref> and future studies will continue to characterize the specificity of CB2-R mediated behavioral effects and their physiological roles. Thus, our data demonstrate the functional expression of CB2-Rs in brain that may provide novel targets for the effects of cannabinoids in depression and substance abuse disorders beyond neuro-immunocannabinoid activity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Human subjects</title><p>166 patients with Major depression (excluded bipolar disorders) diagnosed as depressed by DSM-IIIR criteria without other psychiatric diagnoses, recruited under informed consent. 487 age- and gender-matched controls were research volunteers.
