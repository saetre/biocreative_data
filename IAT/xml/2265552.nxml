The <italic>Drosophila</italic> eye is composed of a regular hexagonal lattice of about 800 individual facets known as ommatidia. Each ommatidium consists of a unit of eight photoreceptor neurons (R1&#x02013;R8) and four cone cells, and is surrounded by pigment cells. The eye develops from a monolayer epithelium known as the eye-antennal imaginal disc. At the start of the third larval instar, the cells in the imaginal disc start to differentiate. This differentiation starts at the posterior of the disc and sweeps anteriorly, preceded by a physical indentation known as the morphogenetic furrow (MF). Developing rows of ommatidia are left in its wake, and this progressive development implies that there is a gradient of developmental stages in a single disc, with the most mature being at the posterior <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001827-Ready1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Most of the cells in the eye disc have a columnar epithelial morphology, but in the morphogenetic furrow they become apically constricted, reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001827-Wolff1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. As a result of this constriction, these cells change from being columnar to bottle-shaped and the consequent change in epithelial packing produces the indentation of the furrow itself <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001827-Escudero1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Immediately after the passage of the furrow, and therefore posterior to it, cells begin to rearrange, developing from random packing into first lines of cells, then arcs, and finally morphologically distinct clusters within the epithelium. This process depends on myosin II contractility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001827-Escudero1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref> but presumably also requires precise changes in the adhesive properties of cells as the clusters separate from their neighbours. In fact, adhesive changes can be directly observed&#x02013;the clusters show increased levels of apical Armadillo/&#x003b2;-catenin, a key component of the adherens junctions, a phenomenon dependent on Atonal and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001827-Brown1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Beyond this increase in adherens junctions, little is known about the adhesion processes that participate in the clustering process.</p><p>Capricious (Caps) and Tartan (Trn) are highly similar transmembrane proteins with multiple extracellular leucine rich repeats (LRRs) and shorter intracellular domains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001827-Chang1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001827-Shishido1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. They share 67&#x00025; protein sequence identity in their extracellular domains, which consist of 14 LRR repeats, but only 15&#x00025; overall identity in their intracellular domains, including a conserved motif of 31 amino acids adjacent to the membrane. Since they lie within 115 kb of each other in the genome, it is likely that they represent a relatively recent gene duplication event. Although their exact molecular function is not well characterised, they can act as homotypic adhesion proteins in cell culture <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001827-ShinzaKameda1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref> and at least in some contexts their intracellular domains are dispensable <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001827-Milan1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001827-Taniguchi1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, supporting the idea that their primary roles are in cell adhesion. Consistent with this, their functions have mostly been associated with their adhesion properties. Caps is required for targeting a subset of embryonic motor neurons to their specific muscles during embryonic development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001827-Shishido1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001827-Taniguchi1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref> and in targeting R8 photoreceptor axons to the appropriate layers of the optic lobe <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001827-ShinzaKameda1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>.

Here we describe the specific and complementary expression patterns of Caps and Trn in the imaginal eye disc and their redundant roles in regulating aspects of epithelial organisation in the morphogenetic furrow and the spacing of developing ommatidia.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Dynamic and complementary expression pattern of <italic>capricious</italic> and <italic>tartan</italic> in the eye</title><p>We initially identified an allele of <italic>caps</italic> in a screen for modifiers of EGF receptor signalling in the eye. This interaction proved inconsistent and was not supported by other alleles of <italic>caps</italic>, so we have not pursued this further. We noticed, however, that <italic>caps</italic> and <italic>trn</italic> have developmentally regulated expression patterns in the eye. In 3<sup>rd</sup> instar eye imaginal discs, <italic>caps-lacZ</italic> is expressed in all cells in the morphogenetic furrow (arrow <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001827-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>) and at a lower level in cells just posterior to the furrow before becoming restricted to single photoreceptor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001827-g001">Fig. 1A'</xref>). By simultaneous staining with the R8 photoreceptor marker Senseless <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001827-Nolo1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, we showed that the single cells eventually expressing <italic>caps-lacZ</italic> are the R8 cells, the founders of ommatidial development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001827-g001">Fig. 1A&#x0201d;</xref>). This result is consistent with the expression pattern reported by Shinza-Kameda et al. (2006), although they limited their description to the later stages when <italic>caps</italic> is restricted to R8. <italic>trn</italic> is a close sequence relative of <italic>caps</italic> and in the wing imaginal disc they are believed to act in partnership as adhesion proteins that regulate cell affinity at compartment borders <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001827-Milan2">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. We therefore examined the expression pattern in the eye of <italic>trn-lacZ.</italic> Interestingly, <italic>trn-lacZ</italic> is also expressed dynamically, initially in all cells in the furrow, then at a lower level in cells just posterior to the furrow, before becoming restricted to a non-overlapping subset of photoreceptor precursors from <italic>caps</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001827-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). <italic>trn-lacZ</italic> colocalised with R1 and R6 markers anti-BarH1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001827-Higashijima1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref> and R7 marker anti-Prospero <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001827-Kauffmann1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref> thereby identifying the cells as R1, 6 and 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001827-g001">Fig. 1B' and 1B&#x0201d;</xref>). In summary, both <italic>caps</italic> and <italic>trn</italic> are widely expressed in the morphogenetic furrow, and each then becomes restricted to non-overlapping subsets of photoreceptors. These complementary expression patterns in the eye suggested that the Caps and Trn proteins might have a previously unrecognised function in eye development.</p><fig id="pone-0001827-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0001827.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title><italic> caps</italic> and <italic>trn</italic> expression in the eye.</title><p>The arrow in each panel marks the morphogenetic furrow (MF) and anterior is to the left in all images, unless otherwise stated.

The range of the phenotype was only 2&#x02013;3 rows of cells beyond the clone border, and in some cases this non-autonomy was predominantly in the wild-type, and sometimes predominantly in the mutant territory.

Again, this was only apparent at the boundaries between mutant and wild-type cells. Ommatidia close to these boundaries were often clearly displaced from their normal positions but there was no obvious change to their individual morphology, nor was the total number of ommatidia obviously affected. 25 individual eye discs containing clones were analysed, and the number of ommatidia adjacent to clonal boundaries was counted, along with the number of these ommatidia that were displaced from their normal position. In total, of 846 ommatidia at boundaries, 187 (i.e. 22&#x00025;) were displaced. This phenotype is also non-autonomous, with both mutant and wild type ommatidia showing mis-positioning. These spacing defects remain later, at pupal stages of eye development, and they are made more apparent by the fusion of neighbouring ommatidia that are abnormally close to each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001827-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>). These fusions are observed in about 5&#x00025; of ommatidia adjacent to clone boundaries. We also observed very occasional defects in the normal number of cone cells (e.g. arrow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001827-g005">Fig. 5C&#x0201d;</xref>). As with the third instar eye disc, the pupal phenotypes were not observed in clones mutant for <italic>caps</italic> or <italic>trn</italic> alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001827-g005">Figs. 5D and 5E</xref>).</p><p>Since we observed defects only at the boundaries between <italic>caps<sup>Del1</sup> trn<sup>28.4</sup></italic> mutant and wild type tissue, we wondered whether the sudden step-like changes in Caps and Trn levels were more important than the overall levels of these adhesion proteins. We therefore made clones over-expressing Caps and Trn but they did not show any visible furrow or ommatidial spacing defects at the clone boundaries (data not shown). This implies that the boundary effects seen in clones of <italic>caps<sup>Del1</sup> trn<sup>28.4</sup></italic> cells are caused by the juxtaposition of cells expressing Caps and Trn with cells not expressing them.</p><p>In summary, we conclude that there is a redundant function for Caps and Trn in controlling aspects of cell morphology and ommatidial spacing in <italic>Drosophila</italic> retinal development.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title><italic>caps</italic> and <italic>trn</italic> double mutant in the wing</title><p>One of the main tissues in which Caps and Trn have been studied is the developing wing imaginal disc. Despite evidence that <italic>caps</italic> and <italic>trn</italic> have an important function in maintaining compartment borders in the wing, previously studied mutants in these genes have not affected the dorsal-ventral boundary <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001827-Milan2">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. We therefore took advantage of having made a previously unavailable double null mutation to look at DV border formation in the wing. Clones of <italic>caps<sup>Del1</sup>trn<sup>28.4</sup></italic> double null (marked by lack of GFP, green) did not perturb or cross the boundary, as marked by staining with an antibody against Senseless (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001827-g005">Fig. 5F</xref>, white arrows). This is consistent with earlier data, where clones of cells simultaneously null for <italic>trn</italic> and hypomorphic for <italic>caps</italic> did not cause defects at the DV boundary <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001827-Milan2">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. The fact that complete loss of both proteins does not affect DV boundary formation or maintenance suggests that Caps and Tartan are not essential for compartmentalising cells in this part of the wing.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>We have shown that the related adhesion proteins Capricious and Tartan have redundant functions in the remodelling of epithelial cell contacts that occur during the early stages of <italic>Drosophila</italic> eye development. Each is expressed in a two phase pattern, first broadly in the furrow and then later in non-overlapping subsets of photoreceptors: Caps in R8 and Trn in R1, 6 and 7. We have made a null mutation of <italic>caps</italic> and also a double null, in which both <italic>caps</italic> and <italic>trn</italic> are absent. Analysis of these mutations shows that while removal of either gene alone has no phenotype, the loss of both leads to subtle but reproducible defects in retinal development. The earliest phenotype is a reduction of apical constriction and accumulation of Armadillo in the morphogenetic furrow. Slightly later, we see displacement of ommatidia from their normal very precise array. Finally, this displacement leads to occasional fusion of neighbouring ommatidia and other minor defects in the pupal retina. Intriguingly, all the defects we observe are limited to clone boundaries; cells fully within the mutant clones appear normal.</p><p>The <italic>caps<sup>Del1</sup>trn<sup>28.4</sup></italic> phenotypes in the eye are relatively minor. They are nevertheless reproducible and quite penetrant. Essentially all clones that cross the furrow perpendicularly show a reduction in apical constriction and Armadillo staining at their clone boundaries, and 22&#x00025; of ommatidia that lie at the clone boundary are detectably misplaced; ommatidial fusion defects in the pupal retina are rarer, at about 5&#x00025;. We propose that these phenotypes are all a consequence of the initial furrow defects, and that these are caused by loss of the furrow expression of Caps and Trn. This implies that the later, photoreceptor-specific expression of Caps and Trn does not participate in the phenotypes reported here. This proposal is based on the following logic. First, the redundant function of the two proteins is difficult to reconcile with non-overlapping expression: if they are in different cells, how can they replace each other's function? Although it would be possible to imagine a scenario where this could occur, a more parsimonious explanation is that the redundant phenotype depends on their function where they are co-expressed, in the furrow. Second, the expression of Caps in R8 is already known to have a quite separate function, in the targeting of the R8 axon growth cones to the appropriate layer of the optic lobe <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001827-ShinzaKameda1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. The R8 cell bodies are in the retina, which is why we see <italic>caps-lacZ</italic> expression there, but the protein must be transported to the axon terminals. Our discovery of an equally specific but non-overlapping expression of Trn, suggests that it too might have an analogous function in axon targeting, although this prediction has not been tested.</p><p>The idea that the later, photoreceptor specific expression of Caps and Trn is responsible for axonal guidance defects, but not retinal patterning, appears inconsistent with the protein expression of Trn that we see at the apical surface of the photoreceptors, i.e. in the retina, distant from the axon terminals. Unfortunately, we could not detect the wild-type protein expression of Caps, which we know to be involved in axonal guidance, so it is possible that Caps protein is localised very differently from Trn&#x02013;only in the axons. Although we must await a better anti-Caps antibody to resolve this fully, on balance we suspect that the apical expression of Trn, and possibly Caps, either reflects a function distinct from the retinal defects we report here and also from axonal guidance; or that it is a non-functional consequence of the intracellular trafficking pathways that transport the functional pool to the axon terminal.</p><p>The third reason for suggesting that the functions we have uncovered are dependent on Caps and Trn in the furrow, and that the later defects in spacing are secondary consequences of a primary furrow defect is that this is consistent with the furrow acting to organise epithelial packing. Detailed inspection of cells in the furrow and immediately after they emerge from it, shows profound rearrangement that starts with straight lines of cells, evolving into arcs and finally into morphologically distinct clusters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001827-Escudero1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Adhesion defects in the furrow may disrupt this process such that ommatidial clusters and their spacing become less ordered. We do not understand why these phenotypes only manifest at clone boundaries, but we presume it is a consequence of a discontinuity in adhesive properties. Similarly, the short range non-autonomy of the phenotype is probably due to local cell packing problems caused by adhesion anomalies at the boundaries of wild-type and mutant tissue. Another possible explanation for the non-autonomous effects is that changes in cell shape and epithelial morphology in the furrow could affect the range or efficiency of intercellular signalling molecules, thereby affecting normal retinal development. Little is known about how epithelial characteristics can modulate secreted signals and this will be a fruitful area for future study.</p><p>A very recent paper by Sakurai et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001827-Sakurai1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref> has analysed the functions of Caps and Trn in the developing leg disc. They also show a completely redundant function caused by rather subtle adhesion defects. Leg disc development is, however, very different from eye development and the developmental consequences are therefore distinct. In the leg, the sharpening of a progressive border that develops between tarsus 5 and the pretarsus segment was compromised in double mutants. By analysing cell movement within the developing leg disc, Sakurai et al. proposed that Caps and Trn expression allows cell mobility within the epithelium: their downregulation coincides with reduced mobility, while their overexpression leads to cell invasion into inappropriate territories. In the eye, there is no evidence for significant mixing of cells within the epithelium and, as described above, our model suggests a different use of a rather similar function for these adhesion proteins. In both cases, however, Caps and Trn appear to regulate the ability of cells within an epithelium to reorganise with respect to their neighbours.</p><p>In summary, we interpret our results to imply that Caps and Trn expressed in the morphogenetic furrow participate in modulating the adhesivity of epithelial cells. At this stage in development, they are beginning to undergo complex and coordinated rearrangements, with concomitant adhesion changes with their neighbours. Even quite minor disruption of this process leads to alterations in epithelial packing that can have consequent effects on the spacing of ommatidia. The relatively minor retinal phenotype of loss of Caps and Trn implies that other adhesion proteins contribute to the overall regulation of this process. For example, <italic>Drosophila</italic> E-cadherin, an essential component of adherens junctions, is necessary for epithelial maintenance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001827-Tepass1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, and mutant (hypomorph) clones fail to form adherens junctions and lose their epithelial integrity completely. We suspect that complex regulation of adhesion may require the action of several adhesion systems. Our data also leads to the tentative suggestion that Trn may, like Caps, have a later function in photoreceptor neuron development, for example in axon targeting. Finally, and on a separate tack, our construction of a double null mutation for <italic>caps</italic> and <italic>trn</italic> allows us to show unambiguously that neither are essential for the normal formation of the dorsal-ventral boundary of the wing imaginal disc, a process that overexpressed Caps and Trn can disrupt <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001827-Milan2">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title><italic>Drosophila</italic> strains</title><p><italic>caps-lacZ</italic> (<italic>caps<sup>02937</sup></italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001827-Shishido1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref> and <italic>trn-lacZ (trn<sup>SO64117</sup>)</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001827-Salzberg1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref> were obtained from Bloomington <italic>Drosophila</italic> Stock Centre.</p><p><italic>trn<sup>28.4</sup></italic>, a null allele generated by P element excision <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001827-Chang1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref> was obtained from Allen Laughon. <italic>hsflp; trn<sup>28.4</sup>FRT2A</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001827-Sakurai1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref> was obtained from Shigeo Hayashi.</p><p><italic>pBacRB<sup>e03402</sup></italic> and <italic>pBacRB<sup>e03153</sup></italic> were obtained from Harvard Exelixis Stock Centre, and used for making the null <italic>caps<sup>pB1</sup></italic> allele.</p><p><italic>caps<sup>16964</sup></italic> was obtained from the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Gene Search Project, Tokyo Metropolitan University.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Mutagenesis/Mutant production</title><sec id="s4b1"><title>caps<sup>pB1</sup></title><p>This new null allele of <italic>caps</italic> was made by exploiting the FLP-FRT based deletion strategy established by Exelixis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001827-Thibault1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001827-Parks1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. <italic>piggyBac</italic> elements <italic>pBacRB<sup>e03402</sup></italic> and <italic>pBacRB<sup>e03153</sup></italic> were used to delete exon 4 and the entire <italic>caps</italic> coding sequence in exon 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001827-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>).
