Mutations in <italic>SRS2</italic> result in a hyper-recombination phenotype, sensitivity to DNA damaging agents and synthetic lethality with mutations that affect DNA metabolism. Several of these phenotypes can be suppressed by inactivating genes of the <italic>RAD52</italic> epistasis group that promote homologous recombination, implicating inappropriate recombination as the underlying cause of the mutant phenotype. Consistent with the genetic data, purified Srs2 strongly inhibits Rad51-mediated recombination reactions by disrupting the Rad51-ssDNA presynaptic filament. Srs2 interacts with Rad51 in the yeast two-hybrid assay and also <italic>in vitro</italic>. To investigate the functional relevance of the Srs2-Rad51 complex, we have generated srs2 truncation mutants that retain full ATPase and helicase activities, but differ in their ability to interact with Rad51. Importantly, the srs2 mutant proteins attenuated for Rad51 interaction are much less capable of Rad51 presynaptic filament disruption. An internal deletion in Srs2 likewise diminishes Rad51 interaction and anti-recombinase activity. We also present evidence that deleting the Srs2 C-terminus engenders a hyper-recombination phenotype. These results highlight the importance of Rad51 interaction in the anti-recombinase function of Srs2, and provide evidence that this Srs2 function can be uncoupled from its helicase activity.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Homologous recombination (HR) is a major pathway for the elimination of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) induced by genotoxic agents or that arise from endogenous damage and replication fork demise. As such, HR is critical for maintaining genome integrity and important for cancer avoidance in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3">1&#x02013;3</xref>). Paradoxically, intermediates generated by the HR machinery can trigger prolonged arrest of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>), and the aberrant resolution of these intermediates can lead to gross chromosomal rearrangements, such as translocations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Moreover, the HR machinery can interfere with other DNA repair pathways, such as <italic>RAD6/RAD18</italic>-mediated post-replicative repair (PRR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). For these reasons, cells possess multiple mechanisms to prevent untimely and deleterious HR events. One such mechanism is mediated by the <italic>SRS2</italic> (Suppressor of RAD Six screen mutant 2) gene in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>.</p><p>A mutant variant of <italic>SRS2</italic> was first recognized as a suppressor of the DNA damage sensitivity of <italic>rad6 </italic>or <italic>rad18 </italic>mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Suppression of the <italic>rad6</italic> or <italic>rad18</italic> DNA repair defect by the <italic>srs2</italic> mutation requires that HR be functional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>), suggesting that <italic>SRS2</italic> negatively regulates HR. By attenuating HR, it is thought that <italic>SRS2</italic> helps ensure the channeling of DNA lesions encountered by the DNA replication machinery into the Rad6/Rad18-mediated PRR pathway. Yeast strains harboring certain <italic>SRS2</italic> mutations also exhibit a hyper-recombination phenotype, failure to recover from DNA damage checkpoint-mediated G2/M arrest, and synthetic lethality with a variety of other mutations, such as <italic>sgs1,</italic> that affect DNA metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). The synthetic lethality of these double mutants often can be overcome by eliminating HR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>), implicating inappropriate HR events as the cause of lethality.</p><p>As a member of the SF1 family of nucleic acid unwinding enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>), Srs2 possesses ssDNA-dependent ATPase and DNA helicase activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). In concordance with the genetic data, Srs2 strongly inhibits the formation of DNA joints in <italic>in vitro</italic> recombination reactions that are mediated by the Rad51 recombinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Extensive biochemical and electron microscopic analyses have shown that Srs2 accomplishes this feat by disrupting the Rad51 presynaptic filament, comprised of a right-handed Rad51 helical polymer assembled on ssDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>), that catalyzes recombination reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). The Rad51 presynaptic filament dissociative function and HR attenuating role of Srs2 require its ATPase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Srs2 interacts with the sumoylated form of the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) at DNA replication forks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). This serves to target Srs2 to DNA replication forks to prevent Rad51 presynaptic filament assembly, thereby avoiding unwanted recombination during DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Interestingly, when PCNA is not able to be sumoylated, Srs2 recruitment to S phase replication fork foci is decreased, while its recruitment to recombination foci is unaffected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). This reveals that recruitment of Srs2 to replication forks or sites of recombination are independent processes.</p><p>Interestingly, even though Srs2 suppresses spontaneous recombination events, it facilitates DSB repair by the synthesis-dependent single-strand annealing (SDSA) pathway of HR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23 B24 B25">23&#x02013;25</xref>). In addition to its DSB repair function, Srs2 has been shown to have a role in DNA damage checkpoint activation during S phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>) and to act with DNA polymerase &#x003b4; to suppress DNA triplet repeat expansion, possibly by unwinding DNA stem-loop structures formed by the repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>).</p><p>By yeast two hybrid and biochemical analyses, Srs2 was found to physically interact with Rad51 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). However, the significance of the Rad51-Srs2 complex with regards to the anti-recombinase function of Srs2 is not clear. Here, we finely map the Rad51 interaction domain in Srs2 and generate mutant srs2 forms that retain ATP hydrolysis and helicase activities, but differ in their ability to interact with Rad51. We show that the Rad51 interaction-deficient mutant srs2 proteins are attenuated for the Rad51 presynaptic filament dissociative function. Our results thus reveal a requirement for complex formation with Rad51 in the anti-recombinase function of Srs2.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Yeast two-hybrid assay</title><p><italic>RAD51 </italic>was fused to the <italic>GAL4</italic> transcription activation domain in the vector pGAD10, and a C-terminal <italic>SRS2</italic> fragment encompassing residues 783&#x02013;1174 harboring the Rad51 interaction domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>) was fused to the <italic>GAL4</italic> DNA-binding domain in pGBKT7.

Consistent with results from the yeast two-hybrid analysis, full length Srs2, srs2 1&#x02013;998, and srs2 1&#x02013;910 were retained on the Affi-Rad51 beads but not on the Affi-BSA beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A and B). Importantly, and consistent with the yeast two-hybrid results, srs2 1&#x02013;860 did not bind the Affi-Rad51 beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A), indicating that it is defective for Rad51 interaction. Moreover, while srs2 1&#x02013;890 showed only a slightly attenuated affinity for Affi-Rad51, little or no srs2 1&#x02013;875 was retained on the Affi-Rad51 beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A).

We used the D-loop assay to test the anti-recombinase activity of our srs2 truncation mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A). As we reported previously, the addition of a small amount of Srs2 (7.5<italic>&#x02013;</italic>15 nM) to the D-loop reaction containing Rad51, Rad54 and the heterotrimeric ssDNA-binding factor RPA led to pronounced inhibition of the reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B).

These findings fit with our observations that the srs2 1&#x02013;860 mutant protein is quite defective in Rad51 interaction and in the inhibition of Rad51-mediated reactions, while the srs2 &#x00394;875&#x02013;902 mutant protein retains some ability to interact with Rad51 and possesses residual anti-recombinase activity.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Despite the important contributions that HR makes to the elimination of deleterious DNA lesions and the re-establishment of injured DNA replication forks, it must be tightly regulated so as to prevent untimely events that interfere with other DNA and replication fork repair processes, or to avoid the generation of toxic nucleoprotein intermediates that trigger prolonged cell cycle arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>). Moreover, crossover HR events are disfavored in mitotic cells, as they can give rise to undesirable chromosome rearrangements, such as translocations. Genetic and other companion analyses have found several pathways able to attenuate undesirable HR events or promote the usage of the conservative SDSA pathway that does not entail the generation of crossovers. Importantly, all of these HR regulatory pathways are dependent on a DNA helicase. Specifically, the human BLM helicase, and likely its <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>counterpart Sgs1, functions with Topo III&#x003b1; (Top 3 in yeast), a type 1A topoisomerase, and other associated factors to resolve key HR DNA intermediates, such as the double Holliday structure, to non-crossover recombinants in a process termed double Holliday junction dissolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>). Interestingly, the Srs2 helicase suppresses spurious HR events and also prevents crossover formation via a unique ability to disrupt the Rad51 presynaptic filament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Genetic and biochemical evidence has been presented to implicate the mammalian RECQ5 helicase in HR regulation via the same general mechanism as Srs2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>). More recently, a separate means of HR regulation has been documented for the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Mph1 helicase and its orthologues human FANCM and <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> Fml1; these orthologous helicases have been suggested to promote the use of the SDSA pathway of HR by disrupting the D-loop intermediate made by the Rad51 recombinase protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>). Finally, the human RTEL1 helicase has also been shown to disrupt Rad51-made D-loops, but this novel attribute of RETL1 is thought to exert a general suppressive effect on HR frequency rather than fulfilling a regulatory role. Importantly, mutations in all the above helicases compromise genome instability and in some cases are associated with the tumor phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>).</p><p>Several of the aforementioned helicases, including Srs2, RECQ5 and BLM/Sgs1 are known to physically interact with Rad51 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>), although the functional significance of these protein-protein interactions has not been addressed. In this study, we have strived to address the functional relevance of the Srs2-Rad51 complex at the biochemical level. Specifically, by a combination of yeast two-hybrid analysis and biochemical mapping, we have narrowed the Rad51 interaction domain to a short region within the Srs2 C-terminus, and have taken advantage of this information to generate several truncation mutants of Srs2 that retain wild-type levels of ATPase and helicase activities but are specifically compromised for Rad51 interaction. Importantly, with both biochemical means and electron microscopy, we have demonstrated a diminished ability of these srs2 mutants to attenuate Rad51-mediated HR reactions and to dismantle the Rad51 presynaptic filament, in concordance with the degree of Rad51 interaction deficiency. We note that, by employing a kinetic assay involving the use of a fluorescently labeled DNA substrate, Antony <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>) also showed recently that the srs2 1&#x02013;860 mutant is deficient in anti-recombinase activity. Thus, in aggregate, our findings and those of Antony <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>) reveal that the efficacy of Srs2 as an anti-recombinase is dependent on its physical interaction with Rad51. Consistent with our biochemical results, we found that the <italic>srs2 1&#x02013;860</italic> mutant displays a hyper-recombination phenotype. Since the srs2 1&#x02013;860 mutant protein retains wild-type levels of ATPase and helicase activities, our results thus provide evidence that the Srs2 helicase domain alone is insufficient for anti-recombinase function in cells. We have shown that the srs2 &#x00394;875&#x02013;902 mutant protein is less impaired for Rad51 interaction or for the ability to inhibit Rad51-mediated reactions <italic>in vitro</italic>. The phenotype of <italic>srs2 &#x00394;875&#x02013;902</italic> cells is accordingly mild or near wild-type.</p><p>Like Srs2, the human RECQ5 helicase associated with Rad51 physically, inhibits the Rad51-mediated D-loop reaction, and catalyzes the removal of Rad51 from ssDNA in a manner that is dependent on its ATPase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>). Based on these functional similarities between Srs2 and RECQ5, it seems reasonable to suggest that Rad51 interaction is also a determinant of the anti-recombinase activity of RECQ5. The results of Antony <italic>et al.</italic> have suggested that Srs2 enhances ATP hydrolysis by Rad51 within the presynaptic filament, thereby hastening Rad51 dissociation from DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>). It will be interesting to test whether RECQ5 also acts by a similar mechanism.</p><p>We note that Srs2 becomes phosphorylated on multiple sites in response to intra-S phase DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>), and several of these phosphorylation sites are located within the C-terminus of the protein, including two such sites in the region spanning residues 875&#x02013;902 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>) that we know are important for complex formation with Rad51 (this work). It will be particularly interesting to ascertain how C-terminal phosphorylation of Srs2 in response to DNA damage regulates its anti-recombinase function via an influence on complex formation with Rad51.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>Research grants (GM074739, ES07061, R01GM57814, GM053738 and R01CA146940) from the US <funding-source>National Institutes of Health</funding-source>, by a Wellcome International Senior Research Fellowship (WT076476, GACR 301/09/317, and GACR 203/09/H046), a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship and a Department of Defense National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate Fellowship.
