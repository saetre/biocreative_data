We thus identified eight lethal mutants out of the 50 cDNAs tested. Six were truncated in their C-terminal region due to the introduction of a stop codon within their coding sequences. Two were full-length with a single point mutation at amino acid 68 or 69. The two latter mutants were overexpressed in insect cells via a recombinant baculovirus and were purified. They were unable to stimulate DNA polymerase delta DNA replication activity on a poly(dA).oligo(dT) template. Cross-linking experiments showed that this was due to their inability to form trimers. Since these two mutations are adjacent and not located in a domain of the protein putatively involved in inter-monomer interactions, our results show that the beta-sheet betaF1 to which they belong must play an essential role in maintaining the 3-dimensional structure of S.pombe PCNA.</p></abstract></article-meta></front></article>
