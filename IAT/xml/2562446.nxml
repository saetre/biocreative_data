Expression of human CLEC9A is highly restricted in peripheral blood, being detected only on BDCA3<sup>+</sup> dendritic cells and on a small subset of CD14<sup>+</sup>CD16<sup>-</sup> monocytes. CLEC9A is expressed at the cell surface as a glycosylated dimer and can mediate endocytosis, but not phagocytosis. CLEC9A possesses a cytoplasmic immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation-like motif that can recruit Syk kinase, and we demonstrate, using receptor chimeras, that this receptor can induce proinflammatory cytokine production. These data indicate that CLEC9A functions as an activation receptor.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><label>*</label><p>This work was supported by the <grant-sponsor>National Research Foundation (South Africa)</grant-sponsor>, the <grant-sponsor>Wellcome Trust and scholarships from Harry Crossley</grant-sponsor>, <grant-sponsor>KW Johnston Research</grant-sponsor>, and <grant-sponsor>Marion Beatrice</grant-sponsor>.

The group V proteins, in particular, are single extracellular CTLD-containing type II transmembrane receptors, which are found only in higher vertebrates and are encoded primarily within a single gene cluster, the NK-gene complex (NKC) on chromosome 12 in human and chromosome 6 in mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>). Most of the group V C-type lectin receptors (CTLR) appear to be expressed exclusively by NK cells and certain subsets of T-cells and play a role in tumor and antiviral immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>). These receptors detect endogenous ligands, such as MHC class I molecules, and are involved in the detection of &#x0201c;altered-self&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;missing self&#x0201d; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>). Immune responses mediated by these CTLRs are largely determined by the balance of signals from &#x0201c;pairs&#x0201d; of inhibitory and activation receptors, which often recognize the same ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>). Inhibitory receptors within this group possess immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs in their cytoplasmic tails, whereas the activation receptors lack cytoplasmic signaling motifs, but associate through charged residues in their transmembrane domains with signaling partners, such as DAP12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>).</p><p>More recently, CTLRs have also been identified on other cell types, including a related subgroup of receptors, the &#x0201c;Dectin-1 cluster&#x0201d; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>). This cluster, which includes Dectin-1, LOX-1, CLEC-1, CLEC-2, MICL, CLEC12B, and CLEC9A, appear to have more diverse ligands and cellular functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>), and the study of these receptors has provided a number of surprising new insights into innate immunity and homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>). For example, Dectin-1 has been shown to be involved in the detection of &#x0201c;non-self&#x0201d; and function as a signaling pattern recognition receptor in anti-fungal immunity, whereas LOX-1 acts as a scavenger receptor, involved in the recognition of a variety of ligands including modified lipoproteins, apoptotic cells, activated platelets, hsp70, and bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>). Furthermore, Dectin-1 and CLEC-2 have been shown to be capable of directly triggering cellular activation through cytoplasmic immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation (ITAM)-like motifs, involving novel interactions with Syk kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>). Here we characterize CLEC9A, a novel group V CTLR located within the &#x0201c;Dectin-1 cluster&#x0201d; of receptors and show that the molecule functions as an activation receptor on a small subset of myeloid cells.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><p><italic>Primary Cells, Cell Lines, and Growth Conditions</italic>&#x02014;Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated from buffy coats (Western Province Blood Transfusion Service, Cape Town, South Africa) using Ficoll-Paque&#x02122; Plus (Amersham Biosciences), as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>).

Following the addition of FITC-labeled zymosan (Invitrogen; 25 particles/cell), cells were incubated at 4 &#x000b0;C for 60 min to allow binding, and then washed extensively to remove unbound particles. For the determination of TNF, RAW264.7 cells were incubated for another 3 h, and the amount of TNF released into the supernatants was determined by ELISA (BD Biosciences). For measuring zymosan binding, cells were lysed in 3% Triton X-100 (Sigma), and the amount of bound zymosan was quantified by fluorometry using a Titertek Fluoroskan II (Labsystems Group Ltd.).</p><p>For the analysis of the Syk-sufficient and Syk-deficient B-cells, 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> transduced cells were stimulated with unlabeled zymosan (Sigma; 1 particle per cell) in 24-well suspension plates for 24 h at 37 &#x000b0;C.

By flow cytometry, we could demonstrate that hCLEC9A was expressed at the cell surface (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>A</italic></xref>), suggesting that similar to the other receptors in the Dectin-1 cluster, CLEC9A did not require an adaptor protein for expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>). Western blot analysis of lysates from the transfected NIH3T3 cells, under nonreducing conditions, indicated that hCLEC9A was expressed as protein of &#x0223c;100 kDa, more than twice its predicted mass (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>B</italic></xref>). However, under reducing conditions, hCLEC9A resolved to two bands of mass of &#x0223c;40 and &#x0223c;45 kDa. Treatment of the transduced cell lysates with PNGase, which removes all <italic>N</italic>-linked glycosylation, further reduced the mass of both bands to &#x0223c;30 kDa (the predicted molecular mass of this protein) and &#x0223c;35 kDa, respectively. The presence of a second band in these cell lysates, which was also observed with Dectin-1, may be due to other post-translational modifications. However, this is unlikely to be <italic>O</italic>-glycosylation, as treatment with <italic>O</italic>-deglycosidase did not affect the mass of this protein. Thus these data indicate that hCLEC9A is expressed as a glycosylated dimer at the cell surface.</p><p>The Dectin-1 cluster of receptors is conserved between species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>), and we identified the murine orthologue based on homology and genomic position. The protein encoded by murine <italic>clec9A</italic> is 53% identical to human CLEC9A, and retains most of the structural features described above, including the intracellular signaling motifs (supplemental Fig. S1). However, from the deduced amino acid sequence, the murine receptor appears to possess an additional <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation site and lacks one of the cysteine residues in the stalk region. Given these differences to the human receptor, we characterized the structural features of murine CLEC9A expressed in transduced NIH3T3 fibroblasts. As for the human receptor, mCLEC9A was expressed at the cell surface, but Western blot analysis indicated that mCLEC9A was not glycosylated and that the receptor was expressed as a monomer (supplemental Fig. S2).</p><p><italic>Expression of CLEC9A on Primary Cells and Tissues</italic>&#x02014;We first examined the expression of CLEC9A by RT-PCR, using primers, which amplified the entire ORF from cDNA isolated from a variety of tissues (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>A</italic></xref>). Human CLEC9A was detected in most tissues, with highest expression apparent in the brain, thymus, and spleen. Only a single band was detected, suggesting that there were no alternative splice variants. The murine orthologue was expressed in most tissues, but a number of bands were detected, which upon sequencing, were shown to be due to alternative splicing (supplemental Fig. S3). While most of these variants lack one or more exons, as found in many other C-type lectins, there was an isoform containing a 7th exon, which extended the polypeptide by 26 amino acids.</p><p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>FIGURE 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Expression of hCLEC9A as a glycosylated dimer.</bold><italic>A</italic>, flow cytometry of live NIH3T3 cells stably expressing HA-tagged hCLEC9A or mDectin-1, as indicated (<italic>gray lines</italic>), demonstrating expression of these receptors at the cell surface.

One mAb (9A11, IgG1) was chosen for further analysis, as this mAb specifically recognized human CLEC9A, as demonstrated by flow cytometry and Western blotting, under nonreducing conditions (supplemental Fig. S4, <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic>). 9A11 could not detect CLEC9A by Western blotting under reduced conditions, or in paraffin-fixed tissues (data not shown).</p><p>We then examined expression of CLEC9A by multicolor live-cell flow cytometry (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>B</italic></xref>). In total human peripheral blood, expression of CLEC9A could be detected on only a very small number of PBMCs (supplemental Fig. S4<italic>C</italic>), consistent with the low levels of expression detected by RT-PCR in PBL. To characterize these cells further, we purified CLEC9A<sup>+</sup> leukocytes by cell sorting, and verified that the isolated cells expressed CLEC9A by RT-PCR (supplemental Fig. S4). By single staining with selected markers, we were able to demonstrate that all sorted CLEC9A<sup>+</sup> cells expressed CD4, CD11c, and HLA-DR (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>B</italic></xref>). The majority of these cells expressed BDCA-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>), but we also detected subpopulations of 9A11<sup>+</sup> cells expressing CD11b, CD64, and CD14. Double staining with these markers revealed that CLEC9A is expressed on three populations of cells, BDCA3<sup>+</sup> dendritic cells (DC), CD11b<sup>+</sup>CD64<sup>+</sup>CD14<sup>+</sup> CD16<sup>-</sup> monocytes, and a CD11b<sup>+</sup>CD64<sup>+</sup>CD14<sup>-</sup>CD16<sup>-</sup> population of cells, which we were unable to identify further. These cells were all negative for expression of CD1a, CD2, CD8, BDCA-1, BDCA-2, DC-SIGN, CD83 as well as lineage specific markers including CD3, CD19, and CD56 (data not shown). Further analysis of PBMCs indicated that CLEC9A was expressed on all BDCA3<sup>+</sup> cells, 5% (&#x000b1; 2%) of all CD11b<sup>+</sup> cells, 2% (&#x000b1; 1%) of all CD14<sup>+</sup> cells, and 6% (&#x000b1; 3%) of all CD64<sup>+</sup> cells (data not shown). <italic>In vitro</italic> cultured, peripheral blood-derived, macrophages, and dendritic cells did not express CLEC9A (data not shown). Thus CLEC9A is predominantly expressed by BDCA3<sup>+</sup> DCs, but also on a minor subset of CD14<sup>+</sup>CD16<sup>-</sup> monocytes as well as a population of CD14<sup>-</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup>CD64<sup>+</sup> cells, which remain to be identified.</p><p><italic>CLEC9A Is an Endocytic Receptor</italic>&#x02014;Given the limitation in obtaining primary CLEC9A<sup>+</sup> cells for analysis, we resorted to determining the function of this receptor in transduced cell lines. Many DC-expressed molecules are involved in antigen uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>) and as the cytoplasmic tail of this molecule contains potential internalization motifs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>), we examined the ability of CLEC9A to mediate endocytosis (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). For this analysis, we cross-linked CLEC9A on the surface of transduced NIH3T3 fibroblasts and monitored the disappearance of this receptor from the cell surface over time by flow cytometry (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>A</italic></xref>). Cross-linking of CLEC9A led to a rapid reduction of the receptor at the cell surface, compared with cells maintained at 4 &#x000b0;C, indicating that the receptor was mediating internalization of the bound antibodies. As before, Dectin-1, which is also known to mediate endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>), was included as a positive control. Similar results were obtained in transduced RAW264.7 macrophages (supplemental Fig. S5), in which we could also demonstrate the formation of intracellular CLEC9A<sup>+</sup> endocytic vesicles, some of which co-stained with the late endosomal/lysosomal marker, LAMP-1 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>B</italic></xref>). These data therefore indicate that CLEC9A is an endocytic receptor.</p><p><italic>CLEC9A Does Not Mediate Phagocytosis</italic>&#x02014;CLEC9A contains a tyrosine-based sequence, which is similar to that shown to mediate phagocytosis in Dectin-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>), so we investigated the possibility that CLEC9A could also mediate particle uptake. As the ligand for CLEC9A is unknown, we constructed a chimeric receptor expressing an HA-tagged extracellular domain of Dectin-1, coupled to the cytoplasmic tail and transmembrane regions of CLEC9A (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>A</italic></xref>). This monomeric chimera would allow us to trigger CLEC9A signaling using zymosan, a defined particulate ligand of Dectin-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>).</p><p>We then expressed the chimeric receptor, as well as full-length HA-tagged CLEC9A and Dectin-1, in RAW264.7 macrophages and examined the ability of these transduced cells to recognize and ingest zymosan.

As expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>), the expression of Dectin-1 conferred the ability to bind zymosan in a &#x003b2;-glucan-dependent fashion, and similar levels of &#x003b2;-glucan-dependent zymosan binding were also obtained with cells expressing the chimeric receptor (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>B</italic></xref>). In contrast, cells transduced with vector only or hCLEC9A were unable to recognize zymosan.</p><p><fig position="float" id="fig3"><label>FIGURE 3.</label><caption><p><bold>Expression of hCLEC9A on BDCA3<sup>+</sup> DC and a subset of CD14<sup>+</sup>CD16<sup>-</sup> monocytes.</bold><italic>A</italic>, RT-PCR analysis showing expression of CLEC9A in most tissues, but predominantly in the brain, spleen, and thymus. <italic>B</italic>, using a novel monoclonal antibody (9A11), CLEC9A was found to be expressed on a minor population of PBMC (see supplemental Fig. S4<italic>C</italic>), and cells expressing this receptor were therefore sorted prior to analysis by multicolor flow cytometry.

Where indicated, some cells were also treated with cytochalasin D to inhibit actin polymerization, and hence particle uptake, and were used as controls in these experiments. As expected, Dectin-1 mediated the internalization of zymosan, in an actin-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>), but we also observed that macrophages expressing the chimeric receptor were able to mediate zymosan uptake.</p><p>The phagocytosis of complex particles can involve several macrophage receptors, and to prove the phagocytic ability of a receptor requires demonstration of this activity when expressed in normally non-phagocytic cells lines, such as NIH3T3 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>). We therefore expressed the chimeric receptor in these fibroblasts and examined the ability of these cells to ingest zymosan.

As previously demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>), Dectin-1 mediated particle internalization in these cells, whereas the chimeric receptor, despite mediating zymosan binding, did not induce particle uptake (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, <italic>C</italic> and <italic>D</italic></xref>).

So we next explored the possibility that signaling via CLEC9A could similarly induce TNF production in the RAW264.7 macrophages transduced with the chimeric receptor. As described above, the expression of Dectin-1 and the chimeric receptor resulted in increased levels of zymosan binding in these cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). Furthermore, both Dectin-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>) and the chimeric receptor induced high levels of TNF in response to zymosan (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>A</italic></xref>). As we have previously shown that Dectin-1 lacking a cytoplasmic tail can mediate zymosan binding, but not the induction of TNF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>), our results indicate that the cellular response induced by the chimeric receptor is due to the presence of the CLEC9A cytoplasmic tail. Thus these data suggest that, like Dectin-1, CLEC9A signaling can induce a proinflammatory response.</p><p><italic>CLEC9A Can Associate and Signal via Syk Kinase</italic>&#x02014;As cytokine induction mediated by Dectin-1 involves signaling via Syk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>), we examined the possibility that this kinase was involved in the intracellular signaling mediated by CLEC9A. For this, we generated tyrosine-phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms of peptides corresponding to the cytoplasmic tails of CLEC9A and Dectin-1. These peptides were then used to immunoprecipitate associated signaling molecules from RAW264.7 cell lysates, which were subsequently analyzed by Western blotting with specific antibodies (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>B</italic></xref>). Probing with anti-phosphotyrosine antibodies indicated a predominant band of &#x0223c;70 kDa in immunoprecipitates with phosphorylated peptides of both CLEC9A and Dectin-1, which we confirmed to be Syk by probing with anti-Syk antibodies. We were also able to show an association with the Src kinase, Lyn, which is thought to be involved in tyrosine phosphorylation of ITAM motifs upon ligand binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>).</p><p>To confirm that CLEC9A could induce intracellular signaling via Syk kinase, we expressed the chimeric receptor in Syk-sufficient and Syk-deficient B-cell lines and monitored their response to zymosan (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>C</italic></xref>). This approach was similar to that we had used previously to demonstrate the Syk-dependent activity of Dectin-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>). The chimeric receptor was expressed at similar levels in both cell types, as determined by flow cytometry (supplemental Fig. S8<italic>A</italic>). The addition of zymosan to the Syk-sufficient B-cells expressing the chimeric receptor induced the production of IL-2. In contrast, this response was absent in vector control-transduced cells and in the transduced Syk-deficient B-cell lines. Furthermore, we could also inhibit the IL-2 response in the Syk-sufficient cells by including the Syk inhibitor piceatannol (supplemental Fig. S8<italic>B</italic>). Thus, CLEC9A can mediate intracellular signaling via Syk kinase.</p></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>We describe here the first characterization of human CLEC9A and demonstrate that it functions as an activation receptor, capable of triggering intracellular signaling via Syk kinase. This interaction is mediated by the cytoplasmic tail of the CLEC9A that contains a single tyrosine-based (E<italic>X</italic>Y<italic>XX</italic>L) sequence, which can be considered to be an ITAM-like motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>). These sequences were first identified in two other receptors of the Dectin-1 cluster, Dectin-1 itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>), and more recently CLEC-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>). While the mechanism of Syk signaling via these motifs is unknown, it requires both SH2 domains of this kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>) and may occur via bridging of two receptor chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>).</p><p>In myeloid cells, ITAM-like mediated signaling through Syk has largely been studied with Dectin-1. Signaling via this kinase occurs through a novel pathway involving CARD9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>) and can induce a variety of cellular responses including the induction of cytokines (such as TNF, IL-6, IL-10, IL-23, and IL-2), the respiratory burst, and the production of arachidonic acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>). In addition, signaling via this pathway was recently shown to induce T-helper type 17 (T<sub>H</sub>17) adaptive responses <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>). As CLEC9A can signal via this pathway, it is possible that this receptor may be able to induce many, if not all, of these responses, which may be influenced by its ability to dimerize.</p><p>The ITAM-like motif of Dectin-1 also mediates phagocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>). Although we could demonstrate that CLEC9A could induce particle uptake in macrophages, it was unable to do so when expressed in NIH3T3 cells. As the definition of a phagocytic receptor is its ability to confer phagocytic activity to normally non-phagocytic cell lines, we conclude that CLEC9A is not directly able to mediate particle uptake. In the RAW264.7 macrophages, it is possible that the residual low levels of endogenous Dectin-1 were contributing to this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>). In addition Dectin-1-mediated phagocytosis occurs through novel mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>), which are still undefined and requires additional tyrosine-proximal residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>) that are absent in CLEC9A.</p><p><fig position="float" id="fig5"><label>FIGURE 5.</label><caption><p><bold>hCLEC9A is not a phagocytic receptor.</bold><italic>A</italic>, schematic representation of the chimeric Dectin-1/CLEC9A receptor. <italic>B</italic>, fluorometric quantitation of zymosan (<italic>zym</italic>) binding by the transduced RAW264.7 macrophages or NIH3T3 fibroblasts, in the presence or absence of soluble &#x003b2;-glucan (&#x003b2;-<italic>glu</italic>), as indicated. <italic>RFU</italic>, relative fluorescence units.

Furthermore, as an endocytic receptor, CLEC9A may facilitate antigen uptake and presentation, and may provide a suitable target for antibody-mediated antigen delivery, as has been demonstrated for a variety of other C-type lectins, including Dectin-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref>).</p><p>Despite being conserved between species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>), the murine CLEC9A orthologue appears to be structurally dissimilar to human CLEC9A.

While the significance of these differences is unclear, they may reflect some degree of functional divergence of this molecule between the various species. However, given the rarity of cells expressing this receptor in human blood, it may still be practical for further study of this receptor to be performed in mice.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplemental Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="M709923200_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="M709923200_1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank the Western Province Blood Transfusion service for providing the buffy coats, and Andrew Marshall, John Davies, Elwira Pyz, Ronald Dreyer, Vicky Tsoni, and Ann Kerrigan for reagents and advice.
