The factor mediates the stress-induced expression of heat shock or stress proteins (HSPs). HSF/HSF1 is inactive in unstressed cells and is activated during stress. Activation is accompanied by hyperphosphorylation of the factor. The regulatory importance of this phosphorylation has remained incompletely understood. Several previous studies on human HSF1 were concerned with phosphorylation on Ser<sup>303</sup>, Ser<sup>307 </sup>and Ser<sup>363</sup>, which phosphorylation appears to be related to factor deactivation subsequent to stress, and one study reported stress-induced phosphorylation of Ser<sup>230 </sup>contributing to factor activation. However, no previous study attempted to fully describe the phosphorylation status of an HSF/HSF1 in stressed cells and to systematically identify phosphoresidues involved in factor activation. The present study reports such an analysis for human HSF1 in heat-stressed cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>An alanine scan of all Ser, Thr and Tyr residues of human HSF1 was carried out using a validated transactivation assay, and residues phosphorylated in HSF1 were identified by mass spectrometry and sequencing. HSF1 activated by heat treatment was phosphorylated on Ser<sup>121</sup>, Ser<sup>230</sup>, Ser<sup>292</sup>, Ser<sup>303</sup>, Ser<sup>307</sup>, Ser<sup>314</sup>, Ser<sup>319</sup>, Ser<sup>326</sup>, Ser<sup>344</sup>, Ser<sup>363</sup>, Ser<sup>419</sup>, and Ser<sup>444</sup>. Phosphorylation of Ser<sup>326 </sup>but none of the other Ser residues was found to contribute significantly to activation of the factor by heat stress. Phosphorylation on Ser<sup>326 </sup>increased rapidly during heat stress as shown by experiments using a pSer<sup>326 </sup>phosphopeptide antibody. Heat stress-induced DNA binding and nuclear translocation of a S326A substitution mutant was not impaired in HSF1-negative cells, but the mutant stimulated HSP70 expression several times less well than wild type factor.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Twelve Ser residues but no Thr or Tyr residues were identified that were phosphorylated in heat-activated HSF1. Mutagenesis experiments and functional studies suggested that phosphorylation of HSF1 residue Ser<sup>326 </sup>plays a critical role in the induction of the factor's transcriptional competence by heat stress. PhosphoSer<sup>326 </sup>also contributes to activation of HSF1 by chemical stress. To date, no functional role could be ascribed to any of the other newly identified phosphoSer residues.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Phosphorylation emerged as a major post-translational mechanism that is well suited for effecting a rapid change in the activity of a transcription factor in response to an extracellular signal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. During periods of physical or chemical stress, transcription of genes encoding cytoprotective heat shock or stress proteins (HSPs) is increased. This enhanced expression is primarily mediated by heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) in vertebrate cells or by a homologous factor (HSF) in non-vertebrate cells. HSF/HSF1 is continuously present in cells but is only activated when the cells experience a stress. It was long known that HSF/HSF1 is hyperphosphorylated in stressed cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>Activation of human HSF1 occurs in at least two steps. A first step results in formation of factor homotrimers that are capable of binding so-called heat shock element (HSE) sequences present in <italic>hsp </italic>genes but essentially lack transcriptional activity. In a second step, these HSF1 homotrimers are converted to a transcriptionally competent form [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In cells exposed to heat, acquisition of HSE DNA-binding activity was observed to precede hyperphosphorylation of HSF1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. This result suggested that hyperphosphorylation could play a regulatory role in the second activation step that renders the factor transactivation-competent. Several additional observations are compatible with the hypothesis that hyperphosphorylation of HSF1 is required for or enhances induction of the transcriptional competence of the factor: (i) To the extent this was examined, all conditions that resulted in activation of HSF1 also induced hyperphosphorylation of the factor. (ii) Conversely, compounds such as salicylate, indomethacin, menadione and hydrogen peroxide that were only capable of triggering the first step of HSF1 activation also failed to prompt factor hyperphosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. (iii) Inhibitors of Ser/Thr protein kinases reduced, and inhibitors of Ser/Thr phosphatases enhanced, HSF1 activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. For the inhibitors investigated it was found that they did not affect HSF1 DNA-binding activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] (see also [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]).</p><p>To date, stress-induced phosphorylation of HSF/HSF1 has not been comprehensively analyzed. However, phosphorylation of Ser<sup>230 </sup>of human HSF1 was reported to contribute to heat activation of the factor by enhancing its transcriptional competence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. It was also proposed that phosphorylation of Thr<sup>142 </sup>of human HSF1 may be essential for factor activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Furthermore, several HSF/HSF1 residues whose phosphorylation repressed factor activity were identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. In human HSF1 these residues are Ser<sup>303</sup>, Ser<sup>307 </sup>and Ser<sup>363</sup>. The present study sought to combine systematic mutagenesis and physical analyses to provide a broad accounting of phosphorylation of HSF1 in heat-stressed cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Validation of a transactivation assay for testing HSF1 mutants</title><p>In chimeric transcription factor LEXA-(human)HSF1 the DNA-binding domain (residues 1&#x02013;78) of the 529-residue human HSF1 polypeptide is substituted with that of bacterial repressor LEXA (residues 1&#x02013;87) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. LEXA-HSF1 is known from previous studies to be regulated similarly as HSF1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Transactivation by LEXA-HSF1 was assessed by dual luciferase assay of cells co-transfected with a firefly luciferase gene responsive to LEXA-HSF1 (LEXA-fLUC) and a constitutively expressed <italic>Renilla </italic>luciferase gene (pRL-TK or pRL-CMV). Reporter activity was expressed as the ratio of firefly and <italic>Renilla </italic>luciferase activities. To permit the identification of mutants of LEXA-HSF1 with only minor functional impairments, the transactivation assay needed to sensitively detect changes in transcription factor activity. To find out whether the assay had this capability under the chosen experimental conditions, 96-well cultures were transfected with different amounts of expression construct LEXA-HSF1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). At amounts below about 2 ng/culture, reporter activity increased proportionally with the amount of expression construct transfected. Hence, at these low DNA concentrations changes in LEXA-HSF1 activity were certain to be reflected in proportional changes in reporter activity. Most subsequent transfections were carried out with 0.5 ng or less of expression construct per 96-well culture. Transfection with 0.5 ng of construct LEXA-HSF1 resulted in a 30% increase in total HSF1 concentration as estimated by western blot one day after transfection (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Assuming a typical transfection efficiency of 20&#x02013;40%, this result implied that transfected cells on average expressed comparable amounts of LEXA-HSF1 and endogenous HSF1. Hence, under these conditions, under which an exogenous HSF1 form was not or was only minimally overexpressed, the regulatory environment encountered by the exogenous HSF1 form was likely to be similar to that to which endogenous factor is exposed. This is a departure from several earlier studies relating to HSF1 phosphorylation, including one from our own group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], in which studies exogenous HSF1 forms were substantially overexpressed. A known result of such overexpression is that a significant fraction of exogenous factor accumulates as DNA-binding trimers in the absence of a stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. At the low levels of expression construct transfected in the assays used herein, this result did not occur (as documented, e.g., by the experiment shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Validation of the transactivation assay used, transactivation analysis of mutant S326A, and isolation of FLAG-HSF1 for phosphorylation analyses</bold>.

Transactivation assays were carried out to compare transcription-enhancing abilities of mutant and parent factors in cells that either had been exposed to a 44&#x000b0;C/30 min heat treatment or had not been heat-treated. It is noted that this heat treatment resulted in only minimal cell death. Results revealed that most mutants retained the strong heat inducibility of the respective parent factor (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Nine mutants (highlighted) had an induced activity that was lower than that of parent factor by more than two average standard deviations (2 &#x000d7; 10.3%). Five of these mutants were only modestly impaired, but four mutants, S326A/T328A, T400A/S(403/404)A, S(457/458/461)A and T511A/S513A, had substantially reduced activities. Mutants S326A/T328A and T511A/S513A were expressed to normal levels. However, mutant T400A/S(403/404)A accumulated to a noticeably lower level, and mutant S(457/458/461)A was cleaved proteolytically (western blot data not shown). These results suggested the possibility that phosphorylation of residues 326, 328, 511 and/or 513 played an important role in activation of HSF1 by heat stress. Mutants S(303/307)A and S307A were about 150% and 50%, respectively, more active than parent factor in heat-treated cells (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).</p><table-wrap

Of these residues only Ser<sup>326 </sup>was actually found phosphorylated in HSF1 from heat-shocked cells. Not all residues that were identified as targets of phosphorylation by mass spectrometry and/or sequencing had been substituted individually in the earlier alanine scan. To rule out the possibility that an effect of substitution of a phosphorylated residue had somehow been masked or otherwise modulated (in the case of Ser<sup>326</sup>) by other substitutions present in the same mutant, single substitutions were prepared and examined in the transactivation assay. All substitutions of phosphorylated serines except for the S326A substitution displayed heat-induced activities comparable to that of parent factor (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>, bottom). The S326A substitution was only about 40% as active as the parent factor (35&#x02013;55% in individual experiments). To test whether substitution of Ser<sup>326 </sup>affected not only heat-induced but also chemically induced HSF1 activity, the activity of the S326A mutant was tested in cells exposed to CdCl<sub>2</sub>. Induction by CdCl<sub>2 </sub>was found to be similarly impaired as induction by heat (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). Note that this reduced activity phenotype was not due to a reduced level of accumulation of the mutant as evidenced by the anti-FLAG western blot shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>. Nucleotide sequencing of the entire S326A-coding sequence confirmed that it did not contain any additional mutation. Furthermore, a second copy of mutant S326A obtained in a separate mutagenesis experiment had a similarly impaired stress-induced activity as the original copy.</p></sec><sec><title>Rapid phosphorylation of HSF1 residue Ser<sup>326 </sup>during heat stress</title><p>A phosphopeptide antibody (referred to below as pSer<sup>326 </sup>antibody) was prepared to specifically monitor phosphorylation of Ser<sup>326</sup>. Heat-induced rates of overall phosphorylation of HSF1 (i.e., phosphorylation of all available sites), of specific phosphorylation of Ser<sup>326 </sup>and of factor oligomerization were compared in the experiment shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> (panels A and B). Cultures were either not heat-treated or heat-treated at 44&#x000b0;C for 5, 10, 15 or 30 min. HSF1 trimerization was assessed by native anti-HSF1 blot. As best seen by following the disappearance of the monomeric form, most HSF1 was or was in the process of becoming oligomeric within 5 min of heat treatment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). For examining overall and Ser<sup>326</sup>-specific phosphorylation, HSF1 was immunoprecipitated using pSer<sup>326 </sup>antibody. Immunoprecipitated HSF1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, "ip" lanes) and HSF1 in extract ("lysate" lanes) were detected by anti-HSF1 western blot. To better resolve different HSF1 species, electrophoresis was continued until the 50 kDa marker had migrated to the end of the gel (only the region containing HSF1 forms, i.e. from about 70 kD protein size, is shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). Results suggested that unstressed cells contained a small amount of HSF1 that could be immunoprecipitated by the pSer<sup>326 </sup>antibody ("ip", first lane). Note that, as would have been expected, the most rapidly migrating immunoprecipitated HSF1 form was slower than the fastest species present in extract (compare 0-min "ip" and "lysate" lanes). Upon heat treatment of the cells, amounts of HSF1 precipitatable from extracts by the pSer<sup>326 </sup>antibody increased about 3 fold (see quantitation below "ip" lanes). This increase was essentially complete after only 5 min of heat treatment. Overall phosphorylation as revealed by a shift from faster- to slower-migrating HSF1 species occurred more slowly and continued over the entire 30-min course of heat treatment ("lysate" lanes). A comparable gradual shift to slower-migrating species was also observed for pSer<sup>326</sup>-containing HSF1 species ("ip" lanes). Thus, heat treatment appeared to result in a substantial increase in the level of phosphorylation of Ser<sup>326</sup>. This increase in phosphorylation occurred about as rapidly as factor oligomerization and preceded phosphorylation of most other sites.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Heat-induced oligomerization and phosphorylation of HSF1</bold>.

Because of the low avidity of the antibody, HSF1 needed to be enriched prior to western blot. Large cultures (in 100 mm plates) were transfected with small amounts of expression construct FLAG-HSF1. One day later, half of the cultures were heat-treated at 44&#x000b0;C for 30 min, and tagged HSF1 was immunoprecipitated using an anti-FLAG resin. Immune-isolated material was then analyzed by western blot using pSer<sup>326 </sup>and FLAG antibodies (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). Recovery of FLAG-HSF1 from heat-treated and untreated cells was comparable (anti-FLAG blot on top).

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Analyses were carried out one day after transfection of expression constructs for HSF1, substitution mutant S326A (in wildtype HSF1 not LEXA-HSF1 background) and control protein &#x003b2;-galactosidase. First, it was examined whether phosphorylation of Ser<sup>326 </sup>affected the first step of HSF1 activation, which step involves acquisition of HSE DNA-binding activity and nuclear localization. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay revealed that HSE DNA-binding activities of wildtype HSF1 and mutant S326A were heat-induced to similar levels (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). Nuclear localization was assayed by standard fractionation of cell extracts and anti-HSF1 western blot. Comparable amounts of wildtype HSF1 and mutant S326A were present in the nuclear fraction of heat-treated cells (data not shown). Thus, phosphorylation of Ser<sup>326 </sup>did not affect the first step of HSF1 activation. To probe the second activation step, i.e., acquisition of transactivation competence, HSF1-negative cells were co-transfected with the above expression constructs and with reporter constructs HSP70-fLUC and rLUC. Cultures either were left untreated or were heat-treated at 43&#x000b0;C for 30 min and further incubated for 6 hours. Transactivation competence was estimated by western blot of endogenous HSP70 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, panels B and C) and by luciferase assay (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>). Heat-induced expression of endogenous HSP70 was reduced by 80% in the cells expressing the S326A mutant of HSF1 when compared to the cells expressing wildtype HSF1. The transfected luciferase reporter was reduced by 50%. The greater effect on HSP70 expression is likely explained by the difference in RNA/protein stability between HSP70 and luciferase.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The present study attempted for the first time to examine phosphorylation of HSF1 in cells exposed to a stress in a comprehensive fashion. Although HSF/HSF1 is activated in cells exposed to various types of stressful events, in the interest of being able to complete a thorough analysis, we decided to focus on phosphorylation of HSF1 in cells responding to a single type of stress, i.e., a heat stress. Our study identified twelve serine residues in human HSF1 that are phosphorylated in heat-stressed cells. Eight of these residues represent phosphorylation sites that were not previously known, i.e., Ser<sup>121</sup>, Ser<sup>292</sup>, Ser<sup>314</sup>, Ser<sup>319</sup>, Ser<sup>326</sup>, Ser<sup>344</sup>, Ser<sup>419</sup>, and Ser<sup>444</sup>. Phosphorylation of all residues previously found to be phosphorylated <italic>in vivo</italic>, i.e., Ser<sup>230</sup>, Ser<sup>303</sup>, Ser<sup>307 </sup>and Ser<sup>363</sup>, was confirmed. No phosphorylation of Thr<sup>142 </sup>or any other Thr or Tyr residue was observed.</p><p>Because the importance of the various phosphorylation events for the activation of human HSF1 could not be predicted, an effort was made to ensure that the basic transactivation assay used in the present study was capable of reporting even relatively minor impairments in the activity of HSF1 mutants as well as examined the exogenous HSF1 forms under conditions that differed as little as possible from those encountered by endogenous factor. Although HSF1-deficient mouse cells were available and were used in later experiments, our initial goal was to identify mutants of human HSF1 that were functionally deficient in human cells. Therefore, mutants were prepared in the LEXA-HSF1 background, allowing us to test effects of mutations in cells containing endogenous HSF1. Because hyperphosphorylation was expected to affect HSF1 transcriptional competence rather than HSE DNA-binding ability, use of an HSF1 form identical to HSF1 except for a substituted DNA-binding domain appeared justified. For obvious reasons, an HSF1 mutant with an impaired activity was not available when assay conditions needed to be established. In the absence of such a mutant, assay conditions were defined, under which reporter activity increased proportionally with amounts of LEXA-HSF1 expression construct transfected. Under the chosen conditions, exogenous HSF1 (i.e., LEXA-HSF1) was expressed at a comparable level as endogenous HSF1. Hence, these conditions also satisfied our second criterion that was to assay exogenous HSF1 in an intracellular situation that closely resembled that encountered by endogenous HSF1. The importance of the latter criterion is exemplified by the previous observation that substantially overexpressed exogenous HSF1 is trimeric and DNA binding in the absence of a stress, whereas endogenous HSF1 is not trimeric and DNA binding under the same conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In the transactivation assays used in the present study, exogenous HSF1 did not specifically bind DNA in the absence of a stress.</p><p>The above-discussed differences between the transactivation assay used in the present study and assays employed in earlier studies provide a ready explanation for the observed differences in phenotypes of mutants S(303/307)A and S307A. The latter substitutions (also in LEXA-HSF1 background) had been examined in a previous study by our laboratory and were found to be active in the absence of a stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] (see also [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]). In this earlier study, HSF1 forms were substantially overexpressed, resulting in accumulation of homotrimeric factors in the absence of a stress. Therefore, the experiments were only capable of assessing effects of mutations on HSF1 transcriptional competence. When examined using the assay of the present study, in which assay oligomerization of exogenous HSF1 forms is regulated, the Ser<sup>307 </sup>and Ser<sup>303</sup>/Ser<sup>307 </sup>substitutions could be expected to be inactive in the absence of a stress, provided that the mutations only affected HSF1 transactivation competence and not also oligomerization. As shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>, this expected result was observed. In heat-stressed cells, however, the Ser<sup>307 </sup>and Ser<sup>303</sup>/Ser<sup>307 </sup>substitutions exceeded the activity of the parent factor. This finding is consistent with a role of phosphorylation at Ser<sup>303 </sup>and Ser<sup>307 </sup>in down-modulation of HSF1 activity during a heat stress or, more likely, during recovery from the stress. Such a role has been proposed previously by others (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]). Also compatible with this hypothesis is that, in a tryptic digest of HSF1 isolated from cells pulse-labeled with <sup>32</sup>PO<sub>4 </sub>during a 44&#x000b0;C/45 min heat treatment, peptide 297&#x02013;309 was among the most intensely radiolabeled peptides (not shown). This finding implied that phosphorylation of Ser<sup>303 </sup>and/or Ser<sup>307 </sup>occurred during heat treatment. Hietakangas et al. recently confirmed that Ser<sup>303 </sup>is inducibly phosphorylated by western blot experiments using a phosphopeptide antibody recognizing pSer<sup>303 </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. As Ser<sup>303 </sup>phosphorylation may require prior phosphorylation of Ser<sup>307 </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], phosphorylation of Ser<sup>307 </sup>is likely also heat-inducible.</p><p>The present study identified HSF1 residue Ser<sup>326 </sup>as a dominant target of regulatory phosphorylation during activation of the factor by a heat stress. Luciferase reporter assays indicated that phosphorylation of Ser<sup>326 </sup>causes the heat-induced activity of HSF1 to at least double. The transactivation assays in which endogenous HSP70 was used as the endpoint revealed that this enhancement of HSF1 activity translates into a fivefold increase in accumulation of HSP70. While our study did not address this issue, it seems likely that the observed five-fold enhancement of HSP70 expression resulting from phosphorylation of Ser<sup>326 </sup>is physiologically important. A previous study demonstrated that a five to eight fold impairment in heat-induced HSP70 expression led to substantially diminished thermotolerance of the affected mouse embryo fibroblast cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Phosphorylation of Ser<sup>326 </sup>also appears to significantly contribute to HSF1 activity induced in cells stressed by exposure to CdCl<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>Our analyses suggested that, individually, phosphorylation of none of the other residues identified as being phosphorylated in heat-treated cells significantly contributes to HSF1 activity. The possibility was considered that phosphorylation of several of these residues may be required for producing a clearly detectable effect. Although this possibility was not examined exhaustively, several combinations of substitutions including or excluding the S326A substitution were tested by transactivation assay (data not shown). These experiments failed to uncover evidence for a functional effect of phosphorylation on residues other than Ser<sup>326</sup>. It is puzzling that HSF1 is phosphorylated on a number of residues (e.g., Ser<sup>121</sup>, Ser<sup>230</sup>, Ser<sup>292</sup>, Ser<sup>314</sup>, Ser<sup>319</sup>, Ser<sup>344</sup>, Ser<sup>419</sup>, and Ser<sup>444</sup>) whose phosphorylation does not appear to affect factor activity. The possibility cannot be formally ruled out that phosphorylation of some of these residues may reflect artifacts due to differences in phosphorylation of exogenous and endogenous HSF1. A more reasonable explanation may be that this phosphorylation may be relevant under conditions not tested in the present study. Such conditions may include different types of stresses or different levels of stresses used to activate HSF1. They may even relate to differences in the transactivation assays used that may result in preferential assessment of different facets of HSF1 activation. This latter explanation may apply to phosphorylation of Ser<sup>230 </sup>that was previously reported to contribute to activation of HSF1 by heat stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Another likely possibility is suggested by the fact that HSF1 not only transactivates HSP genes but also participates in the regulation of several important signaling pathways (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]). Phosphorylation of Ser residues that appears gratuitous with respect to regulation of HSP expression may affect interactions of HSF1 with components of these other pathways and alter their activity.</p><p>In agreement with earlier work, heat stress induced rapid trimerization of HSF1. The substantial enhancement of phosphorylation of Ser<sup>326 </sup>that was induced by heat stress occurred within a similar time frame. This rapid rate of phosphorylation of Ser<sup>326 </sup>was commensurate with what was expected for a phosphorylation event that was critical for heat stress activation of HSF1. Most other phosphorylation events that could be monitored by their effect on gel mobility occurred more slowly. Hence, it was possible that some of these later events required prior phosphorylation of Ser<sup>326</sup>. However, that at least some of this phosphorylation occurred independent of Ser<sup>326 </sup>phosphorylation was suggested by the observation of a heat-induced SDS-PAGE mobility shift for mutant S326A (data not shown).</p><p>The present study provides evidence that phosphorylation of Ser<sup>326 </sup>stimulates the transcription-enhancing activity of HSF1 but not its DNA-binding activity. How this phosphorylation results in increased transcriptional competence of HSF1 remains to be elucidated. The observation that substitution of Ser<sup>326 </sup>with neither Asp nor Glu reproduced the effect of phosphorylation on factor activity (data not shown) suggested that the mechanism is not based on simple charge repulsion. Perhaps, phosphorylation of Ser<sup>326 </sup>induces a local conformational change that affects binding of a chaperone complex or another regulatory protein to the nearby regulatory domain that is known to be involved in repression of transcriptional competence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Alternatively, pSer<sup>326 </sup>may be a critical aspect of a binding site for an unknown co-activator. Identification of the protein kinase that phosphorylates Ser<sup>326 </sup>in heat-stressed cells would be helpful for determining whether the level of phosphorylation of the residue is actively regulated and, if this were the case, by what stress-induced mechanism. Unfortunately, a search of the sequence within which Ser<sup>326 </sup>is embedded for protein kinase sites using the NetPhosp program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] did not provide any useful information about candidate protein kinases.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The present article is concerned with regulation of human HSF1, which is a key factor mediating the transcriptional response of human cells to physical and chemical stresses and a coregulator of other important signaling pathways (e.g.. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]). HSF1 has even been discovered to regulate aging and age-related disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. To arrive at a better description of the mechanisms that enable cells to respond to various stresses by transiently upregulating HSP gene expression, it will be important to learn about the extent to which phosphorylation of HSF1 modulates these responses as well as to discover how phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of HSF1 itself is regulated by stresses. Furthermore, it can be expected that a thorough understanding of regulatory phosphorylation of HSF1 will advance our knowledge about what controls the interactions of this factor with other pathways as well as likely will, through the eventual identification of regulated protein kinases and phosphatases involved in HSF1 phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, lead to the identification of new connections with additional regulatory systems. The present study represents an initial contribution towards these larger goals. Our systematic analysis of HSF1 phosphorylation in heat-stressed cells identified twelve phosphorylated Ser residues, of which eight were not previously known. Mutagenesis and functional experiments revealed that newly identified phosphoSer<sup>326 </sup>plays an important role in heat activation of HSF1 transcriptional activity as evidenced by the fact that substitution of this residue reduced HSP70 accumulation several fold. Phenotypes for substitutions of Ser<sup>303 </sup>and Ser<sup>307 </sup>were observed that are consistent with the previously proposed function of phosphorylation of these residues in HSF1 deactivation. Although no evidence for functional roles of other phosphoserines could be obtained in this study, knowledge of the identity of most or all residues phosphorylated in heat-activated HSF1 should greatly facilitate further directed experiments to test the potential importance of their phosphorylation in the various processes and interactions in which HSF1 is known to participate. It cannot be excluded that through the use of different transactivation assays functions of the latter phosphoresidues in heat regulation of HSF1 activity may be discovered that escaped detection in this study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Antibodies</title><p>PhosphoSer<sup>326</sup>-specific rabbit polyclonal antibody was raised against peptide CSVDTLLpSTAL.
