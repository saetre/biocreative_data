L11 was recently shown to regulate p53 activity through a direct binding with MDM2 and abrogating the MDM2-induced p53 degradation in response to ribosomal stress. However, the studies were performed in cell lines and the significance of this tumor suppressor function of L11 has yet to be explored in animal models. To investigate the effects of the deletion of L11 and its physiological relevance to p53 activity, we knocked down the <italic>rpl11</italic> gene in zebrafish and analyzed the p53 response. Contrary to the cell line-based results, our data indicate that an L11 deficiency in a model organism activates the p53 pathway. The L11-deficient embryos (morphants) displayed developmental abnormalities primarily in the brain, leading to embryonic lethality within 6&#x02013;7 days post fertilization. Extensive apoptosis was observed in the head region of the morphants, thus correlating the morphological defects with apparent cell death. A decrease in total abundance of genes involved in neural patterning of the brain was observed in the morphants, suggesting a reduction in neural progenitor cells. Upregulation of the genes involved in the p53 pathway were observed in the morphants. Simultaneous knockdown of the <italic>p53</italic> gene rescued the developmental defects and apoptosis in the morphants. These results suggest that ribosomal dysfunction due to the loss of L11 activates a p53-dependent checkpoint response to prevent improper embryonic development.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The ribosome is an essential complex macromolecule responsible for protein synthesis in all organisms.

Such phenotypes are believed to be due to a reduced protein synthesis capacity of their ribosomes. However, recent reports indicate that mutations in RPs in vertebrates lead to specific phenotypes that are unlike the nonspecific general phenotypes typically expected for housekeeping genes. For example, a mutation in <italic>Rpl24</italic> in mice results in the &#x02018;Belly spot and tail&#x02019; (<italic>Bst</italic>) mutant, which displays a kinked tail, a white ventral midline spot, and other skeletal deformities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004152-Oliver1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>.

Thus, many RPs may have distinct functions, besides their involvement in ribosome formation, which are currently unknown. Investigating these unknown functions of RPs using animal models is vital for understanding the role of ribosomal proteins in human diseases.</p><p>L11 is one such RP proposed to have a dual physiological role; it is thought to participate in ribosomal assembly and in regulation of p53 activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004152-Zhang1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. Studies in human cell lines have demonstrated that L11 binds to MDM2, prevents MDM2-mediated p53 ubiquitination and degradation, stabilizes and activates p53, and induces cell cycle arrest <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004152-Zhang1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004152-Bhat1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>.

These results indicate that a p53-mediated apoptotic response is activated upon <italic>rpl11</italic> knockdown in zebrafish.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>In recent years, three RPs, L5, L11, and L23, have been shown to regulate p53 activity by binding to MDM2 specifically in response to a ribosomal stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004152-Zhang1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004152-Marechal1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004152-Dai1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref> which has led to speculations about a novel ribosome-mediated p53 checkpoint mechanism. Of these three RPs, L11 has been the most extensively studied for its role in the MDM2-p53 pathway. Previous reports have shown that overexpression of L11 in ribosome-perturbed cells, but not in DNA-damaged or oncogene-activated cells, greatly increases L11-MDM2 binding in a p53-dependent manner both in normal and in tumor cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004152-Zhang1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004152-Sun1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover, the direct binding of L11 (central domain, amino acids 51&#x02013;108) is essential for MDM2 stabilization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004152-Dai2">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. Taken together, these results indicate that L11 is a major inhibitor of the MDM2-p53 feedback loop in response to ribosome stress.</p><p>To understand the importance of this association in a model system like zebrafish, we reduced the level of L11 protein by a knockdown strategy and analyzed the phenotypes. The MO used in this study was designed to target the initiation codon of <italic>rpl11</italic> mRNA so that the synthesis of the entire protein was blocked. Since L11 is required for ribosome assembly, knocking down this protein should result in a ribosomal stress. And as the association of L11-MDM2 greatly increases in response to ribosomal stress, it is expected that removal of L11 in a system without DNA damage or oncogenic overexpression should result in reduced L11-MDM2 binding or increased MDM2-p53 binding.</p><p>Contrary to expectations, our data show that an L11 deficiency activates the p53 pathway leading to developmental abnormalities, apoptosis, and embryonic lethality. Interference with ribosomal biogenesis by actinomycin D further increased the level of apoptosis in L11-deficient embryos (data not shown), as ribosomal biogenesis was already compromised in these embryos.</p><p>We have clearly shown that this p53 activation and the associated neural cell death in rpl11 MO-injected embryos is not an off-target effect of morpholino <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004152-Robu1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref> but a result of specific loss of L11 protein. First, our morphants were phenotypically similar (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004152.s006">Figure S4</xref>) to a zebrafish mutant line having a viral insert in the <italic>rpl11</italic> gene (<italic>rpl11<sup>hi3820btg</sup></italic>). This mutant was identified in a forward genetic screen for essential genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004152-Amsterdam2">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. Second, we have verified the loss of L11 protein by using a human L11 antibody. Third, the phenotype of the L11 morphants was completely rescued by MO resistant <italic>rpL11</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004152-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Fourth, upregulation of p53 response in other RP mutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004152-Danilova1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref> and ribosome-associated protein mutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004152-Skarie1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref> validates our data that p53 activation in L11-deficient embryos is not due to non-specific morpholino response but due to the specific loss of L11 protein. Finally, the control morpholino, which is a five base mismatch of the original MO, did not result in any phenotype, apoptosis or upregulation of the p53 pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004152-g001">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004152-g004">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>It can be argued that L5 and L23, which also have MDM2 binding properties, may be responsible for the observed increased p53 activity in L11-deficient embryos. In the absence of proper ribosome assembly, these proteins may remain free in the nucleus and bind to MDM2, thereby activating p53. To exclude the possibility of an L5/L23-MDM2 association in L11-deficient embryos, we simultaneously knocked down the <italic>rpl5</italic>, <italic>rpl11</italic>, and <italic>rpl23</italic> genes in zebrafish and analyzed the phenotypes. Our results showed that even in the absence of these p53 regulatory RPs, the embryos displayed severe morphological deformities and a high level of apoptosis, indicating an activated p53 response (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004152.s007">Figure S5</xref>).</p><p>Therefore, it is likely that improper ribosome biogenesis, rather than the loss of a specific function of L11, activates the p53 dependent response and leads to morphological defects and increased apoptosis in L11-deficient embryos. Deficiency of any RP, regardless of its role in p53 regulation, may lead to such a consequence.

In unpublished studies, we also found that knockdown of <italic>rps24</italic> and <italic>rpl35</italic> in zebrafish results in morphological abnormalities and increased apoptosis, indicating an upregulated p53 response. Thus, an activation of the p53 seems to be a common response to ribosomal stress.</p><p>Upregulation of a truncated isoform of p53, &#x00394;113p53, which results from an alternative start site in the 4<sup>th</sup> intron and lacks part of the DNA binding domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004152-Chen1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>, was suggested to be a diagnostic signature of off-target neural death by MOs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004152-Robu1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>.

Previous studies have suggested that mutations in nucleolar proteins involved in ribosome assembly result in ribosomal stress and nucleolus disruption resulting in the release of these three RPs (L5, L11, and L23). These free RPs then bind to MDM2 and activate p53 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004152-Opferman1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004152-Boisvert1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>. However, our data indicates that even in the absence of these RPs, p53 still gets activated. We assume that in case of an RP (L11) deficiency, ribosomal subunit assembly will be severely affected and several nucleolar proteins that would otherwise participate in the assembly may remain unutilized. Accumulation of these unused processing factors within the nucleolus may be sensed as a stress signal leading to an activated p53 response. Interestingly, we observed upregulation of <italic>bop1</italic>, <italic>rrs1</italic>, and <italic>pes</italic>, nucleolar proteins required for the nuclear assembly and export of the 60S pre-ribosomal subunit <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004152-Strezoska1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004152-Azuma1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004152-Miyoshi1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref> in L11-deficient embryos (data not shown).</p><p>However, it still remains unclear why an L11 deficiency results in restricted phenotypes, mainly in the developing brain, when ribosomes are so critical and essential for all cells. It has been suggested that in zebrafish, initial embryonic development relies on a large pool of maternal ribosomes, and that the brain may be the first tissue to &#x0201c;run out&#x0201d; of maternal ribosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004152-Azuma1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. The brain belongs to the &#x02018;highly proliferative tissue zone&#x02019; during early zebrafish development. During somitogenesis, the rate of ribosome production may vary between organs and, because of its large size and rapid development, this rate may be highest in the brain. At 24 hpf, the expression pattern of many assembly factors and processing proteins, such as <italic>bop1</italic>, <italic>rrs1</italic>, and <italic>bap28</italic>, show a spatial distribution, with the highest concentration in the brain region <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004152-Azuma1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004152-ZFIN1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>, supporting the notion that ribosome production is highest in the brain. Therefore, absence of L11 leads to impaired ribosome synthesis, which results in phenotypes specific to the brain region.</p><p>As mentioned previously, a number of cellular studies have shown RPs (L5, L11 and L23) as negative regulator of p53 because of their MDM2 binding property. A decrease of these RPs should allow an increase of free MDM2, thereby decreasing the levels of p53. However, our results indicate that in zebrafish loss of L11 individually or in combination with other two RPs (L5 and L23), actually increases the p53 activity, rather than decreasing it. Recently, it has been shown that RP mutant zebrafish which develop MPNSTs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004152-Amsterdam1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, fail to synthesize p53 protein, but this observed loss of p53 is not due to the L5/L11/L23-MDM2 regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004152-Maclnnes1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, it seems likely that some other mechanism of p53 activation exists in the cell which links RPs to ribosomal biogenesis stress. We speculate that in a model system like zebrafish, loss of L11 would affect its primary function, namely participation in ribosome assembly. Accumulation of defective ribosomes due to RP deficiency would be sensed as a stress signal, presumably a nucleolar stress, leading to programmed cell death. A failure to activate this p53-dependent checkpoint could potentially lead to uncontrolled cell growth, as seen in tumorigenesis. Such a consequence may be true for other RPs, regardless of their MDM2-binding properties.</p><p>Future studies need to be directed towards understanding the underlying mechanism of how RP insufficiency activates the p53 pathway and what roles individual RPs play in this pathway. Such studies could provide valuable insights into the relationship between ribosomal abnormalities and diseases.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Morpholino oligonucleotide injections</title><p>Morpholinos were obtained from Gene Tools, LLC (USA).
