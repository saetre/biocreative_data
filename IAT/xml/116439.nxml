The increase in protein synthesis after 16&#x02013;24 h has been linked to the increased protein levels of translation initiation factors. However, the regulation of protein synthesis during the early onset of T cell activation has not been studied in great detail. We studied the regulation of protein synthesis after 1 h of activation using &#x003b1;CD3 antibody to stimulate the T cell receptor and &#x003b1;CD28 antibody to provide the co-stimulus.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Activation of the T cells with both antibodies led to a sustained increase in the rate of protein synthesis. The activities and/or phosphorylation states of several translation factors were studied during the first hour of stimulation with &#x003b1;CD3 and &#x003b1;CD28 to explore the mechanism underlying the activation of protein synthesis. The initial increase in protein synthesis was accompanied by activation of the guanine nucleotide exchange factor, eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 2B, and of p70 S6 kinase and by dephosphorylation of eukaryotic elongation factor (eEF) 2. Similar signal transduction pathways, as assessed using signal transduction inhibitors, are involved in the regulation of protein synthesis, eIF2B activity and p70 S6 kinase activity. A new finding was that the p38 MAPK &#x003b1;/&#x003b2; pathway was involved in the regulation of overall protein synthesis in primary T cells. Unexpectedly, no changes were detected in the phosphorylation state of the cap-binding protein eIF4E and the eIF4E-binding protein 4E-BP1, or the formation of the cap-binding complex eIF4F.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Both eIF2B and p70 S6 kinase play important roles in the regulation of protein synthesis during the early onset of T cell activation.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The initiation of translation of mRNAs is an important control point in protein synthesis in eukaryotes and requires a set of initiation factors (eIFs). The cap-binding protein eIF4E recognises the 5'cap-structure of the mRNA, and is a component of the eIF4F complex consisting of eIF4E, eIF4G, a scaffolding protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], and eIF4A, an RNA helicase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Any secondary structure in the 5'untranslated region of the mRNA is thought to be unwound by eIF4A together with eIF4B or eIF4H [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The 40S subunit of the ribosome binds to the eIF4F complex through an association between eIF4G and eIF3, which interacts directly with the 40S ribosomal subunit. The preinitiation complex, containing the 40S ribosomal subunit, eIF4F, eIF4B, and Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub>&#x02022;eIF2&#x02022;GTP, scans the 5'UTR until the AUG start codon is located. The subsequent hydrolysis of the GTP bound to eIF2 is promoted by eIF5, after which eIF2&#x02022;GDP leaves the ribosome. The 60S ribosomal subunit can then join and the 80S complex is formed. eIF2 in the GDP-bound state is inactive and, in order to return to the active form again, the GDP is exchanged for GTP in a step promoted by the guanine nucleotide exchange factor eIF2B.</p><p>The next stage in the translation process, the elongation step, can be regulated via changes in the activity of eEF2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Phosphorylation of eEF2 at Thr56 results in its complete inactivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>Human primary T-cells are metabolically quiescent, with little ongoing DNA, RNA or protein synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The low protein synthesis rate in quiescent T cells is associated with low levels of initiation factors in these cells. The rate of protein synthesis increase 2&#x02013;4 fold after 4 h of mitogenic stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], and it has been reported that the mRNA and protein levels for several translation initiation factors increased during T cell activation. The mRNA levels of eIF4A, eIF2&#x003b1;, and eIF4E increased rapidly after stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. However, the increase in the levels of the corresponding protein lagged significantly behind. It is therefore likely that increased levels of translation factors contribute to the pronounced stimulation of protein synthesis that occurs during T cell activation at later times, while modulation of the activity of several translation initiation factors e.g. by phosphorylation or association with binding proteins is important in the early phase of T cell activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>Increased phosphorylation of eIF4E in T lymphocytes has been reported under several conditions. Activation of quiescent mature porcine peripheral blood mononuclear cells with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) or concanavalin A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] or stimulation of human primary T cells with PHA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], PMA, or PMA plus ionomycin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] caused a rapid increase in the phosphorylation of eIF4E. Similarly, stimulation of the T cell receptor in the human leukaemic T cell line Jurkat with OKT-3, or treatment with PMA, increased eIF4E phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], and a significant increase in the amount of eIF4F complexes was also detected.</p><p>The activity of eIF4E can also be modulated by its association with eIF4E-binding proteins, of which 4E-BP1 is the best-studied. Phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 leads to its dissociation from eIF4E, leaving eIF4E free to bind eIF4G and form eIF4F complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. In a murine cytotoxic T cell line, interleukin-2 induced the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. 4E-BP1 is present in human primary T lymphocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] and becomes phosphorylated in response to PMA or PMA plus ionomycin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>In several cell lines, an increase in eIF2B activity coincides with an increase in protein synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. One mechanism to regulate the activity of eIF2B is via phosphorylation of its &#x003b5;-subunit (eIF2B&#x003b5;) by GSK-3, which causes a decrease in eIF2B activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Stimulation of T cells with PMA plus ionomycin caused a rapid rise in eIF2B activity, which coincided with inactivation of GSK-3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], suggesting a role for dephosphorylation of eIF2B&#x003b5;. The activity of eIF2B can also be modulated by phosphorylation of the &#x003b1;-subunit of eIF2. eIF2 phosphorylated in its &#x003b1;-subunit acts as a competitive inhibitor of eIF2B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Stimulation of T cells with PHA did not cause significant changes in the phosphorylation state of eIF2&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], excluding this mechanism of regulation under this condition.</p><p>In this study we used the antibodies, &#x003b1;CD3 and &#x003b1;CD28, to activate resting human primary T lymphocytes. Engagement of &#x003b1;CD3 activates the T cell receptor, while cross-linking of &#x003b1;CD28 with the B7 receptor will supply a co-stimulatory signal, which is required for full activation of a resting T cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. We have studied the effects of T cell activation on protein synthesis and on the activities and/or phosphorylation states of several translation initiation factors.

After 30 min of treatment, a clear phosphorylation of ERK and p38MAPK was detected (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Treatment with PMA, a potent activator of PKC, was used as a positive control. PMA induced, in particular, a greater extent of phosphorylation of ERK than &#x003b1;CD3 plus &#x003b1;CD28.

To study the signalling events involved in this increase in protein synthesis, we performed the experiment in the presence of different specific signal transduction pathway inhibitors (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). The increase in overall protein synthesis was consistently blocked by each of the signal transduction inhibitors used, i.e. the PI 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin, the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin, the p38 MAPK&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; inhibitors SB203580 and SB202190, and the MEK inhibitor PD98059.

Furthermore, the phosphorylation of eIF4E has been reported to be increased in response to several different treatments of primary T lymphocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] or the Jurkat T cell line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. However, activation of T cells with &#x003b1;CD3 and &#x003b1;CD28 for up to 60 min did not cause a significant change in the phosphorylation state of eIF4E (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). Stimulation of T cells with either &#x003b1;CD3 or &#x003b1;CD28 alone was also insufficient to change the phosphorylation state of eIF4E (data not shown). We did detect a marked change in phosphorylation of eIF4E after 30 min of PMA treatment, indicating that the cells respond to this stimulus (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). In addition, treatment of the Jurkat T cell line with &#x003b1;CD3 and &#x003b1;CD28 caused phosphorylation of eIF4E that was already detectable after 30 min, demonstrating the effectiveness of the antibodies (&#x003b1;CD3 and &#x003b1;CD28) used (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Regulation of eIF4E phosphorylation and eIF4F formation.</bold>&#x000a0;<bold>A.</bold> Jurkat T cells were activated for 30 or 60 min by both &#x003b1;CD3 and &#x003b1;CD28.

The phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 can be detected by virtue of a reduction in its mobility upon SDS-PAGE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. As a control to demonstrate that different forms of human 4E-BP1 can be resolved on our gel system, we used HeLa cell extract and in this case three separate bands (&#x003b1;, &#x003b2; and &#x003b3;) were indeed detected (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>), indicative of differently phosphorylated forms.

Surprisingly, no 4E-BP1 associated with eIF4E was detected, even though up to 2 mg of T cell extract was used in a m<sup>7</sup>GTP Sepharose pull down (data not shown).

We therefore examined the activity of eIF2B after activation of primary T cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). After 1 h of activation with &#x003b1;CD3 and &#x003b1;CD28, the activity of eIF2B increased 2.2 fold. The increase in eIF2B activity was not caused by a change in the phosphorylation state of the &#x003b1;-subunit of eIF2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>) or by an increase in the amount of eIF2B&#x003b5; protein (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E</xref>).

Taken these results together it suggested that eIF2B was regulated directly, e.g. via phosphorylation. To study which signal transduction pathways are involved in the regulation of the activity of eIF2B, the cells were activated in the presence of specific signal transduction pathway inhibitors and eIF2B activity was measured. The basal activity of eIF2B was slightly affected in the presence of the PI 3-kinase inhibitor wortmannin, the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin, and the p38 MAPK&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; inhibitor SB203580, however the &#x003b1;CD3 plus &#x003b1;CD28-induced increase in eIF2B activity was completely blocked in the presence of each inhibitor.

Early reports showed that stimulation of primary T cells with pharmacological stimuli, e.g. PHA or PMA, led to an increase in protein synthesis and protein levels of certain translation initiation factors within 16 h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. More recently the regulation of protein synthesis and translation factors after a 6 h stimulation of primary T cells with PMA or PMA/ionomycin was described in detail [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>We investigated the regulation of protein synthesis and translation factors during the early phase of activation of resting T cells by &#x003b1;CD3 and &#x003b1;CD28, i.e. 1 h of activation. The protein synthesis rate in T cells rapidly increased after treatment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), and several signalling pathways, i.e. ERK and p38 MAPK phosphorylation and PKB activation, were stimulated, showing the efficacy of the &#x003b1;CD3 and &#x003b1;CD28 antibodies in activating the cells.</p><p>The increase in protein synthesis after 1 h was mediated via multiple signalling pathways, e.g. the MEK, p38 MAPK&#x003b1;/&#x003b2;, PI 3-kinase and mTOR pathway, as indicated by the use of signal transduction inhibitors (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). In several cell types, the involvement of either MEK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>], PI 3-kinase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>] or mTOR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>] in the activation of protein synthesis has been described. However, this is the first time that a role for the p38 MAPK&#x003b1;/&#x003b2;pathway (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) in the regulation of overall protein synthesis has been described. This role is supported by the fact that two structurally unrelated p38 MAPK&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; inhibitors, i.e., SB202190 and SB203580, were each able to block the increase in protein synthesis.</p><p>The increase in protein synthesis after activation of T cells with &#x003b1;CD3 and &#x003b1;CD28 coincided with an increase in the activities of p70 S6 kinase and eIF2B and dephosphorylation of eEF2, which is indicative of an increase in its activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The dephosphorylation of eEF2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>) was very transient, and therefore it is unlikely that eEF2 plays an important role in the sustained increase in protein synthesis after T cell activation. However, activation of eEF2 could be important for the initial increase in protein synthesis.</p><p>The stimulation of p70 S6 kinase was mediated via similar signalling pathways (Fig. 7) to those underlying the activation of overall protein synthesis. Inhibition of PI 3-kinase, mTOR, p38 MAPK&#x003b1;/&#x003b2;, or MEK during T cell activation by &#x003b1;CD3 and &#x003b1;CD28 prevented the activation of p70 S6 kinase, indicating that multiple signalling pathways are required for regulation of p70 S6 kinase activity. The effect of rapamycin on the activation of p70 S6 kinase in response to &#x003b1;CD3 and &#x003b1;CD28 has been reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. Inhibition of the activation of p70 S6 kinase by SB203580 has been described before in insulin-stimulated rat vascular smooth muscle cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. Furthermore, it has been reported that SB203580 (at the concentration used, 10 &#x003bc;M) can inhibit phosphorylation of PKB at Threonine308 and thus its activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. Since PKB is an upstream component of the signalling pathway towards p70 S6 kinase, this could provide a mechanism by which SB203580 blocks activation of p70 S6 kinase.</p><p>Each of the other signalling pathways studied here has also been implicated in the regulation of p70 S6 kinase activity in a variety of cell types under a range of conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. However, in human primary T cells all of them appear to be important for the regulation of p70 S6 kinase activity after stimulation with &#x003b1;CD3 and &#x003b1;CD28.</p><p>The activity of the guanine nucleotide exchange factor, eIF2B, also was mediated via similar signalling pathways as the increase in protein synthesis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>).</p><p>The increase in eIF2B activity after activation of T cells with &#x003b1;CD3 and &#x003b1;CD28, at the early times we examined, was not due to an increase in eIF2B protein level or to changes in eIF2&#x003b1; phosphorylation. Therefore, modification of the eIF2B protein complex probably caused the increase in eIF2B activity. The modulation of the activity of the eIF2B complex after activation of T cells with &#x003b1;CD3 and &#x003b1;CD28 required several different signalling pathways, e.g. MEK, p38 MAPK&#x003b1;/&#x003b2;, mTOR and the PI 3-kinase pathway. These signalling pathways have been reported separately to be involved in the regulation of eIF2B activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. However, this is the first report where all these pathways are involved in the regulation of eIF2B in a single cell type.</p><p>A small inactivation of GSK-3 was detected after activation of primary T cells with &#x003b1;CD3 and &#x003b1;CD28. However, no dephosphorylation of Ser540 in eIF2B&#x003b5; was detected (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E</xref>), excluding a role for GSK-3 in regulating the activity of eIF2B under these conditions. In contrast, studies employing PMA/ionomycin-activated T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], insulin treatment of various cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], and cell survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] have implied a role for GSK-3 in regulating eIF2B activity.</p><p>In contrast to previously reported data using mitogenic stimuli to activate primary T cells or Jurkat T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], eIF4E phosphorylation, association of eIF4G with eIF4E and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation remained unchanged after T cell activation using &#x003b1;CD3 and &#x003b1;CD28 as a stimulus (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Signal transduction inhibitor studies showed that the MEK and p38 MAPK&#x003b1;/&#x003b2; pathways are important for eIF4E phosphorylation in Jurkat T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], and a role for MEK was demonstrated previously in primary T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The weaker activation of the ERK pathway in particular (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) by &#x003b1;CD3 and &#x003b1;CD28 in primary T cells may well account for the absence of increased phosphorylation of eIF4E under these conditions.</p><p>We did not observe increased phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 in response to &#x003b1;CD3 and &#x003b1;CD28, even though it has been reported to occur after cytokine stimulation of a murine cytotoxic T cell line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] or after 6 h of mitogenic stimulation of human primary T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. However, Grolleau <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] showed that 4E-BP1 was present in primary T cells mainly in its dephosphorylated form, and no significant change was detected after PMA treatment. Our results are consistent with this last finding; 4E-BP1 is mainly present as one band, and no change in mobility is observed upon cell treatment. This is consistent with the observation that eIF4F complex formation did not alter. However, it remains surprising that eIF4F complexes are present when 4E-BP1 is completely dephosphorylated, and therefore presumably associated with eIF4E. We were unable to detect any 4E-BP1 associated with eIF4E, which is probably due to the low 4E-BP1 protein levels in resting T lymphocytes, thus explaining basal eIF4F formation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The treatment of primary T lymphocytes with &#x003b1;CD3 and &#x003b1;CD28 activates two key components of the translational machinery, p70 S6 kinase and eIF2B. The activities of these translation factors were regulated similarly to the activation of protein synthesis, consistent with an important role for the components in the activation of protein synthesis by &#x003b1;CD3 and &#x003b1;CD28. Interestingly, activation of protein synthesis, p70 S6 kinase, and eIF2B is inhibited by rapamycin, a compound that was first discovered as an immunosuppressant, suggesting that mTOR regulated translation is involved in the process of T cell proliferation. The activation of p70 S6 kinase is related to the regulation of translation of specific mRNAs, while the activation of eIF2B is likely to be required for stimulation of general protein synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. This suggests that increases in both specific and general protein synthesis are important in the early phase of T cell activation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Primary T cell isolation and cell treatment</title><p>Buffy coats used for the isolation of T cells were prepared from freshly drawn blood from healthy human donors and were obtained from the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service (Edinburgh, UK).
