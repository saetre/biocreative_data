Transcription of rrnG terminator fragments was also studied in vitro. We found that termination of rrnG transcription is a complex process controlled by a tandem Rho-independent and Rho-dependent terminator arrangement which we designate rrnG-tt'. Together, these two elements were 98% efficient at terminating transcription initiated at the rrnG-P2 promoter. When the two elements were separated, however, we found that the Rho-independent structure was only 59% efficient while the Rho-dependent fragment alone could account for total transcriptional termination of the tandem arrangement. The rrnG termination region was resistant to rrn antitermination and, therefore, possesses some means of stopping antiterminated transcription. The distal rrnG sequence contains several additional noteworthy features; the rrnGt' fragment contains a REP (repetitive extragenic palindromic) sequence and homology with a small unidentified reading frame following rrnE. This sequence is followed by witA, which is homologous to a citrate transport gene, citB. Finally, our sequence, obtained from plasmid pLC23-30, contains a Tn1000 insertion that is absent from the E. coli chromosome. This insertion lies 975 bp beyond the 5S gene and is not involved in the termination events examined in this study.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00088-0112-a" xlink:role="1849"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00088-0108.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1845"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00088-0109.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1846"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00088-0110.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1847"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00088-0111.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1848"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00088-0112.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1849"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00088-0113.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1850"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00088-0114.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1851"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00088-0115.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1852"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
