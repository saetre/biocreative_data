However, these essential intronic elements cannot be transmitted through retrovirus vectors and their deletion may compromise the therapeutic potential for gene therapy. Here, we systematically regenerate functional &#x003b2;-globin intron 2 elements that rescue LCR activity directed by 5&#x02032;HS3. Evaluation in transgenic mice demonstrates that an Oct-1 binding site and an enhancer in the intron cooperate to increase expression levels from LCR globin transgenes. Replacement of the intronic AT-rich region with the Ig&#x003bc; 3&#x02032;MAR rescues LCR activity in single copy transgenic mice. Importantly, a combination of the Oct-1 site, Ig&#x003bc; 3&#x02032;MAR and intronic enhancer in the BGT158 cassette directs more consistent levels of expression in transgenic mice. By introducing intron-modified transgenes into the same genomic integration site in erythroid cells, we show that BGT158 has the greatest transcriptional induction. 3D DNA FISH establishes that induction stimulates this small 5&#x02032;HS3 containing transgene and the endogenous locus to spatially reorganize towards more central locations in erythroid nuclei. Electron Spectroscopic Imaging (ESI) of chromatin fibers demonstrates that ultrastructural heterochromatin is primarily perinuclear and does not reorganize. Finally, we transmit intron-modified globin transgenes through insulated self-inactivating (SIN) lentivirus vectors into erythroid cells. We show efficient transfer and robust mRNA and protein expression by the BGT158 vector, and virus titer improvements mediated by the modified intron 2 in the presence of an LCR cassette composed of 5&#x02032;HS2-4. Our results have important implications for the mechanism of LCR activity at ectopic integration sites. The modified transgenes are the first to transfer intronic elements that potentiate LCR activity and are designed to facilitate correction of hemoglobinopathies using single copy vectors.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Expression of the &#x003b2;-globin gene is regulated by interactions between a distant Locus Control Region (LCR) and regulatory elements in or near the gene. We previously showed that LCR activity requires specific &#x003b2;-globin intron elements to consistently activate transgene expression in mice. These important intronic elements fail to transmit through lentivirus vectors designed for gene therapy of Sickle Cell Anemia. In this study, we identify intron modifications that reveal functional cooperation between the &#x003b2;-globin intronic enhancer and an intronic Oct-1 site. LCR activity in transgenic mice is also potentiated by an intronically located Ig&#x003bc; 3&#x02032;MAR element. During induction of erythroid gene expression, the modified intron directs relocalization of the transgene away from the nuclear periphery towards more central neighbourhoods, and this movement mimics relocalization by the endogenous &#x003b2;-globin locus. Lentivirus vectors with the modified intron produce high titer virus stocks that express the transgene to therapeutic levels in erythroid cells. These findings have implications for understanding the mechanism of LCR activity, and for designing safe and effective lentivirus vectors for gene therapy.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="17"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The &#x003b2;-globin gene is regulated by a Locus Control Region (LCR) that interacts with gene proximal elements to activate erythroid specific expression.

We show that the Oct-1 site cooperates with the &#x003b2;-globin intronic enhancer to increase expression levels in transgenic mice. The Ig&#x003bc; 3&#x02032;MAR rescues LCR activity by 5&#x02032;HS3 in single copy transgenic mice, and the combination of both an intronic Oct-1 site and Ig&#x003bc; 3&#x02032;MAR in the BGT158 construct gives high expression levels nearly equivalent to those directed in the presence of the complete ATR. At a specific integration site in erythroid cells, the BGT158 construct is most responsive to transcriptional induction and spatially reorganizes into the nuclear interior. The endogenous &#x003b2;-globin locus also moves internally while ultrastructural heterochromatin organization remains primarily peripheral. Insulated lentivirus can be generated for all the 5&#x02032;HS3 constructs with BGT158 giving the highest protein and RNA expression in erythroid cells. In addition, the modified BGT158 intron 2 increases the titer of vectors containing a larger LCR cassette (5&#x02032;HS4, 5&#x02032;HS3 and 5&#x02032;HS2), although it is not essential for high level expression in this context. Overall, our data demonstrate the importance of an intronic Oct-1 site and MAR element to potentiate LCR activity by 5&#x02032;HS3, show that a 5&#x02032;HS3 &#x003b2;/&#x003b3;-globin transgene undergoes normal nuclear relocalization during erythroid cell maturation, and provide evidence that modified introns are compatible with efficient lentivirus transduction resulting in robust A&#x003b3;-globin expression.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Novel LCR &#x003b2;/&#x003b3;-Globin Hybrid Transgenes with Intronic Oct-1 and MAR Elements</title><p>We previously showed that the BGT64 transgene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000051-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) with a deletion of the 372 bp ATR directed reduced mean per copy expression of 31&#x00025; and did not express at all integration sites in transgenic mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000051-Rubin1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>.

We chose the MEL BGT158 cells for this analysis because they have the greatest induction of RNA over this period. To detect the BGT158 transgene by FISH, the 10 kb SFV plasmid used for FRT site-specific insertion was labeled with digoxigenin (DIG) and the probe signal was amplified using Alexa Fluor 546 labelled tyramide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000051-Cai1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. FISH signals were detected on BGT158 transgenes (see 3D reconstruction in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000051.s006">Video S1</xref>), but not in the MEL acceptor cell line containing the FRT site (data not shown). Measurements of the mean radial distribution of BGT158 transgenes in &#x0003e;80 nuclei from each of 3 experiments were binned into 5 radial shells extending from shell 1 at the periphery to shell 5 at the centre (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000051-g006">Figure 6A and 6B</xref>). The z-sections used for these measurements had the same average nuclear diameter in both the uninduced and induced samples. In uninduced cells, the majority of BGT158 transgenes (54&#x00025;) are detected in shell 2, near but not at the nuclear periphery. After HMBA induction, BGT158 transgene localization in shell 2 falls to 37&#x00025; with a concomitant increase in its frequency in more internal shells. Due to the high cumulative n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;250 nuclei from 3 separate experiments, these results are significant at P&#x0003c;0.001 by two-sided Mann-Whitney test. At the same time we measured transgene proximity to the nearest DAPI-rich heterochromatin. Approximately 62&#x00025; of BGT158 transgene signals are within 1 &#x000b5;m of DAPI-rich heterochromatin in the uninduced state, but HMBA induction only slightly reduces this proximity to 51&#x00025; (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000051.s001">Figure S1</xref>). To confirm that radial relocalization is dependent on BGT158 sequences and is not a consequence of the FRT integration site, we repeated the experiment using a 3.0 kb LacZ fragment as probe on the original MEL acceptor cell line. In this case there was no relocalization after induction with greater than 50&#x00025; of the signal remaining in shell 2 (P&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.92) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000051-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). These data document relocalization of the BGT158 transgene towards more internal nuclear positions during globin gene induction. To extend these results, relocalization of the globin transgene was tracked using the same 3D DNA FISH probe in BGT64 and BGT156 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000051-g006">Figure 6C and 6D</xref>). In the absence of the intron 2 ATR, the BGT64 transgene preferentially localized to shell 2. After induction there was a slight reduction in shell 2 occupation but without any obvious preference for moving internally (P&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.35). BGT156 transgenes localized in shells 1 and 2 before moving internally into shells 2 and 3 upon induction (P&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.04). We conclude that the intron 2 ATR contributes to nuclear relocalization during erythroid induction.

This technique allows visualization of chromatin fibers after electron microscopy of 70 nm cell sections. We first examined the effect of 3 days HMBA induction on nuclear volume in low magnification phosphorus enhanced mass images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000051-g008">Figure 8A</xref>). While there is a range of diameters measured in the random sections chosen, the average nuclear diameter of induced cells is reduced by 24&#x00025; compared to untreated controls and thus the average nuclear volume is significantly smaller. This size reduction could potentially result in a global compaction of chromatin. To address whether the volume change leads to an increase in the amount of condensed chromatin, we measured the area of condensed chromatin along the nuclear envelope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000051-g008">Figure 8B</xref>). These areas from each cell were normalized to the perimeter corresponding to the area measured to provide a measurement of compaction of chromatin along the nuclear envelope. We found that there was a slight increase in the average amount of peripheral heterochromatin, though this difference was not statistically significant. The vast majority of the condensed chromatin within these cells is located at the periphery, or adjacent to the nucleolus, with a moderate subset localizing to the regions surrounding the nucleolus. To represent the most extreme differences in nuclear diameter, we chose to compare one of the largest uninduced nuclei to one of the smallest induced nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000051-g008">Figure 8C&#x02013;8F</xref>). Qualitative analysis of the high magnification phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) images indicates that thickened regions of condensed chromatin (CCh) along the nuclear envelope are interspersed with regions where the condensed chromatin is thinly represented (arrow) and where nuclear pores can be easily visualized (arrowhead). The remainder of the chromatin throughout the nucleoplasmic volume is represented by relatively decondensed (DCh) and sparsely represented chromatin fibers. The volume not represented by chromatin (blue) has decreased by differentiation but the structural features of the decondensed and the condensed chromatin is unaffected.

To determine how the modified BGT158 intron 2 might influence expression of transgenes that also include 5&#x02032;HS4 and 5&#x02032;HS2, we generated insulated lentivirus vectors with the 3.0 kb BGT14 LCR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000051-Ellis3">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref> composed of 5&#x02032;HS4, 5&#x02032;HS3 and 5&#x02032;HS2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000051-g010">Figure 10A</xref>). These vectors have different intron 2 compositions; BGT159 contains the wild-type intron 2 from BGT50, BGT160 contains the intron 2 ATR deletion from BGT64, and BGT161 contains the modified BGT158 intron 2. Infections of MEL cells with 4 to 40 &#x000b5;l of virus were performed for comparison with the BGT158 lentivirus. Flow cytometry for A&#x003b3;-globin expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000051-g010">Figure 10B</xref>) demonstrates that BGT159 fails to make significant virus titers per ml (&#x0003c;6&#x000d7;10<sup>4</sup>) as expected for the wild-type intron 2. In contrast, BGT160 and BGT161 produce high and roughly equivalent levels of A&#x003b3;-globin protein (MFI 270 and 239) that exceed the levels from BGT158 (MFI 119), suggesting that 5&#x02032;HS4 or 5&#x02032;HS2 can compensate for the absence of the intron 2 ATR. Nevertheless, the titer of the BGT158 virus is much greater (1.4&#x000d7;10<sup>7</sup>) than BGT160 (5.2&#x000d7;10<sup>5</sup>). The presence of the modified intron 2 in BGT161 increased the titer to 2.3&#x000d7;10<sup>6</sup>. With respect to RNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000051-g010">Figure 10C</xref>), the sample infected with 4 &#x000b5;l of BGT158 virus produced 1.54&#x000d7;10<sup>4</sup> A&#x003b3;-globin molecules (75&#x00025; of mouse &#x003b2;-globin), while 40 &#x000b5;l of BGT160 produced 0.97&#x000d7;10<sup>4</sup> (48&#x00025;) and 10 &#x000b5;l of BGT161 produced 0.81&#x000d7;10<sup>4</sup> molecules (40&#x00025;).

We conclude that the larger LCR cassette can compensate for the absence of the intron 2 ATR in MEL cells, but that the modified BGT158 intron 2 increases the titer of viruses with the larger LCR. In summary, the use of this modified intron 2 in 5&#x02032;HS3 and larger LCR constructs including 5&#x02032;HS4 and 5&#x02032;HS2 should facilitate consistent expression at single vector copy during gene therapy of hemoglobinopathies.</p><fig id="pgen-1000051-g010" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1000051.g010</object-id><label>Figure 10</label><caption><title>Increased titer by the BGT158 intron 2 and complementation by other HS elements.</title><p>(A) Map of the PL.SIN.cHS4 lentivirus showing the LCR (5&#x02032;HS2-4) &#x003b2;/&#x003b3;-globin transgene and other components described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000051-g009">Figure 9</xref>.

Using different combinations of intronic elements, we show that the Oct-1 site cooperates with the &#x003b2;-globin intronic enhancer to raise the mean level of expression in transgenic mice, and that the Ig&#x003bc; 3&#x02032;MAR can functionally interact with 5&#x02032;HS3 to direct LCR activity at single copy integration sites. The BGT158 construct containing all of these elements shows good induction in erythroid cells with normal nuclear relocalization dynamics. Moreover, BGT158 transmits at high titer through lentivirus vectors and expresses robust A&#x003b3;-globin levels in erythroid cells.

These results demonstrate the functional importance of the Oct-1 site in rescuing expression levels in the presence of the intronic enhancer.
