Protein phosphorylation/dephosphorylation are major signalling events induced by osmotic stress in higher plants. Sucrose non-fermenting 1-related protein kinase2 family members play essential roles in response to hyperosmotic stresses in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, rice, and maize. In this study, the function of <italic>TaSnRK2.4</italic> in drought, salt, and freezing stresses in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> was characterized. A translational fusion protein of TaSnRK2.4 with green fluorescent protein showed subcellular localization in the cell membrane, cytoplasm, and nucleus. To examine the role of <italic>TaSnRK2.4</italic> under various environmental stresses, transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants overexpressing wheat <italic>TaSnRK2.4</italic> under control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter were generated. Overexpression of <italic>TaSnRK2.4</italic> resulted in delayed seedling establishment, longer primary roots, and higher yield under normal growing conditions. Transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> overexpressing <italic>TaSnRK2.4</italic> had enhanced tolerance to drought, salt, and freezing stresses, which were simultaneously supported by physiological results, including decreased rate of water loss, enhanced higher relative water content, strengthened cell membrane stability, improved photosynthesis potential, and significantly increased osmotic potential. The results show that <italic>TaSnRK2.4</italic> is involved in the regulation of enhanced osmotic potential, growth, and development under both normal and stress conditions, and imply that <italic>TaSnRK2.4</italic> is a multifunctional regulatory factor in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. Since the overexpression of <italic>TaSnRK2.4</italic> can significantly strengthen tolerance to drought, salt, and freezing stresses and does not retard the growth of transgenic <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> plants under well-watered conditions, <italic>TaSnRK2.4</italic> could be utilized in transgenic breeding to improve abiotic stresses in crops.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Abiotic stress</kwd><kwd>morphological character</kwd><kwd>physiological trait</kwd><kwd>stress responses</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Drought, salinity, and cold are major environmental stresses that severely reduce agricultural productivity worldwide. To cope with water deficit, plants have developed various mechanisms to protect cellular activities and maintain whole plant integrity. Many stress-induced genes have been identified, including those encoding fundamental enzymes of abscisic acid (ABA) biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bray, 1997</xref>), proteins involved in osmotic adaptation and tolerance of cellular dehydration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shinozaki and Yamaguchi, 1997</xref>), cellular protective enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ingram and Bartels, 1996</xref>), and a range of signalling proteins such as transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Soderman <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>) and protein kinases/protein phosphatases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hong <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>).</p><p>In eukaryotes, reversible protein phosphorylation is central to perception of and response to environmental stresses, and constitutes a major mechanism for the control of cellular functions, such as responses to environmental stimuli and pathogens, and hormonal control of metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cohen, 1988</xref>). Genetic evidence clearly shows that type 2C and 2A protein phosphatases function in the early ABA signalling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sheen, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kwak <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). As a counterpart, various stress-inducible protein kinase families such as mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wrzaczek and Hirt, 2001</xref>), calcium-dependent protein kinase (CDPK) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ludwig <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>), and SNF1-related protein kinase (SnRK), which were first analysed in yeast from where the name originated, are activated by ABA and diverse stress signals.</p><p>Yeast SNF1 protein kinase, mammalian AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and plant SnRK protein are highly conserved and play pivotal roles in growth and metabolic responses to cellular stress. In yeast, SNF1 is involved in a variety of functions, including regulation of glucose-responsive genes, control of pseudohyphal growth under nutrient limitations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cullen and Sprague, 2000</xref>), and regulation of meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Honigberg and Lee, 1998</xref>). In mammals, AMPK acts as an energy-level sensor to regulate metabolism under low-energy conditions. In plants, SnRKs were grouped into three subfamilies: SnRK1, SnRK2, and SnRK3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hrabak <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). SnRK1 kinase is well characterized at the molecular and biochemical levels, and evidence indicates that SnRK1s have roles in regulating energy metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hardie <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>). SnRK2 and SnRK3 are unique to plants and are involved in responses to environmental stresses. Several SnRK3 members are extensively characterized, and the well-known SOS2 is required for Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> homeostasis in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gong <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>).</p><p>Current studies indicate that the SnRK2 family is involved in hyperosmotic stress responses and ABA signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Boudsocq <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>, 2007; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kobayashi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). Ten SnRK2s were identified in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>; nine of them were activated by hyperosmotic and salinity stresses, and five of the nine were activated by ABA, whereas none was activated by cold stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Boudsocq <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). AtSRK2.6/AtSnRK2E/OST1 and <italic>Vicia faba</italic> AAPK were activated by ABA and were involved in ABA regulation of stomatal closing and ABA-regulated gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mustilli <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yoshida <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). Overexpression of <italic>AtSnRK2.8/AtSnRK2C</italic> enhances drought tolerance in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Umezawa <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). In rice, 10 SnRK2 members were identified; all were activated by hyperosmotic stress, and three were also activated by ABA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kobayashi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). With overexpression of <italic>SAPK4</italic>, one rice member significantly enhanced salt tolerance of transgenic plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Diedhiou <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). In maize, 10 SnRK2 members were cloned, and most <italic>ZmSnRK2</italic> genes were induced by one or more abiotic stresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Huai <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>). In soybean (<italic>Glycine max</italic>), four SnRK2 members were isolated, and all were activated by hyperosmotic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yoon <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Monks <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>). NtOSAK, identified in tobacco, was involved in the response to hyperosmotic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kelner <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). In wheat, only one SnRK2 member, PKABA1, was induced by ABA and hyperosmotic stress, and it repressed the activities of gibberellic acid-inducible promoters when transiently overexpressed in barley aleurone layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gomez-Cadenas <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>, 2001; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Johnson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). Previous findings suggest that many SnRK2 members are involved in the response to environmental stimuli, and different members exhibit diverse expression patterns, suggesting they may play different roles in response to abiotic stresses. However, knowledge of specific functions of SnRK2s is fragmentary and their role in stress signalling is still enigmatic. There is a paucity of reports about wheat SnRK2 members.</p><p>In this study, <italic>TaSnRK2.4</italic>, an SnRK2 member from wheat, was cloned and its expression patterns in response to water deficit, high salinity, low temperature, and ABA treatment were determined. Various expression patterns occurred with different stresses. Transgenic experiments indicated that <italic>TaSnRK2.4</italic> significantly increased tolerance to drought, salt, and freezing stresses in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. Morphological assays revealed that overexpression of <italic>TaSnRK2.4</italic> did not cause negative effects on the growth and yield of transgenic plants. Therefore, <italic>TaSnRK2.4</italic> might be utilized to improve abiotic stress tolerance in plants.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Plant materials and water stress experiments</title><p>Wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic> L.) genotype &#x02018;Hanxuan 10&#x02019; with a conspicuous drought-tolerant phenotype was used in this study.

The ORF encodes a polypeptide of 364 amino acid residues (AARs) with a predicted molecular mass of 42.1&#x02009;kDa and a pI of 6.05. The deduced amino acid sequence shows high homology with counterpart monocot SnRK2 family members, that is <italic>Oryza sativa</italic> and <italic>Zea mays</italic>, and relatively lower homology with SnRK2s from dicot species, such as <italic>Glycine max</italic> and <italic>A. thaliana</italic>.

Experimental approaches, including forward and reverse genetics and transcriptome analysis, have been applied to identify key molecular factors that facilitate crop acclimation to environmental stresses. Compelling evidence indicates that protein phosphorylation is one of the central signalling events occurring in response to environmental stress in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ichimura <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>). In this study, an osmotic-stress activated protein kinase gene, <italic>TaSnRK2.4</italic>, was identified in common wheat, and gene structure analysis indicated similarity to counterparts in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, rice, and maize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Huai <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>), implying <italic>SnRK2.4</italic> evolved before separation of monocots and dicots.</p><p>The expression pattern can be a direct indication of a gene's involvement in developmental or differential events. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, AtSRK2.8/AtSRK2C was identified as a root-specific protein kinase, and AtSRK2.6/AtSRK2E/OST1 was confirmed to play a pivotal role in stomatal closure in leaves, suggesting that different SnRK2 members have various roles in different tissues. Higher expression levels of <italic>TaSnRK2.4</italic> in both the booting spindle and seedling roots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2A</xref>) suggested it might act as a fundamental signalling molecule of water and/or nutrient status in soil and play crucial roles in reproductive organ development.</p><p>Growing evidence supports a role for the <italic>SnRK2</italic> family in response to multienvironmental stress. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kobayashi <italic>et al.</italic> (2004)</xref> observed up-regulation of SAPK4 under ABA or NaCl treatment in rice. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Huai <italic>et al.</italic> (2008)</xref> identified the response of <italic>ZmSAPK4/ZmSnRK2.4</italic> to ABA, heat, and NaCl in maize seedlings. In this study, expression of <italic>TaSnRK2.4</italic> was detected under diverse environmental stresses, including PEG, salt, cold, and ABA treatments, and similar double-peaked expression patterns were identified under various stresses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2B</xref>). Significant differences in expression levels and response times indicate that <italic>TaSnRK2.4</italic> is very sensitive to NaCl and PEG stresses, and less sensitive to ABA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2B</xref>). These results suggest that <italic>TaSnRK2.4</italic> might be involved in the very rapid response to PEG and NaCl stresses.</p><p>Evidence from cultured plant cells shows extremely early activation of AtSRK2C and NtOSAK, suggesting that SnRK2s might be activated almost from the beginning of osmotic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kelner <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Umezawa <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). An original aim of the present study was to detect dynamic responses of <italic>TaSnRK2.4</italic>. Transcriptional peaks were witnessed as early as 1&#x02009;h after stress was applied, a result that was quite similar to that found for AtSRK2C reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Umezawa <italic>et al.</italic> (2004)</xref>. In future research, additional time points and shorter time periods need be set for more precise identification of response activation of TaSnRK2.4s following osmotic stress.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>TaSnRK2.4</italic> overexpression has no adverse effects in Arabidopsis</title><p>To investigate the <italic>in vivo</italic> role of TaSnRK2.4 in plant abiotic resistance, the fused TaSnRK2.4&#x02013;GFP was overexpressed in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. Before functional analysis of <italic>TaSnRK2.4</italic> in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, overexpression of <italic>TaSnRK2.4</italic> was re-identified by western blotting (data not shown). Growth retardation is a common phenomenon, often occurring in transgenic plants and severely restricting the utilization of target genes in plant breeding. To assess the feasibility of using <italic>TaSnRK2.4</italic> in transgenic breeding for abiotic stress tolerance, the morphological features of transgenic <italic>TaSnRK2.4</italic> plants were closely monitored. Seed germination of transgenic plants was delayed by 24&#x02009;h relative to WT controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">data not shown</xref>). Seed dormancy is a complex trait, influenced by a myriad of genetic and environmental factors, many of which are mediated by hormones, with gibberellin, ethylene, and brassinosteroids known to promote germination and ABA known to promote dormancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Koornneef <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Millar <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Recent studies show that AtSnRK2D/AtSnRK2.2, AtSnRK2E/AtSnRK2.6, and AtSnRK2I/AtSnRK2.3 protein kinases involved in ABA signalling are essential for the control of seed development and dormancy through extensive control of gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fujii <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nakashima <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). The extended SET of <italic>TaSnRK2.4</italic> seed may possibly be due to dormancy. The existing reports and results of this study support the classification of AtSnRK2D/AtSnRK2.2, AtSnRK2E/AtSnRK2.6, and AtSnRK2I/AtSnRK2.3 protein kinases in subclass III and TaSnRK2.4 in subclass I of the SnRK2 family. All are involved in seed dormancy, suggesting that participation in dormancy is a basic function of this kinase family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Boudsocq <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). Pre-harvest sprouting, which commonly occurs in conditions of prolonged rainfall and high humidity before harvesting, severely affects the yield and quality of wheat. The extended SET of <italic>TaSnRK2.4</italic> seed can be regarded as a form of sprouting delay that might be usable to improve pre-harvest sprouting resistance in wheat. Although the current data provide no obvious explanation for the delayed germination, more focus should be given to determining the cause of prolonged SET. This will not only provide an understanding of the delayed germination, but overexpression of TaSnRK2.4 may have a role in pre-harvest sprouting control in wheat.</p><p>The visibly smaller seedling size of <italic>TaSnRK2.4</italic> plants is probably due to the prolonged SET, a difference that vanished later in development. Root length determination results indicate that <italic>TaSnRK2.4</italic> plants have longer primary roots than the WT and GFP control plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5A</xref>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/erp331/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S2</ext-link> at <italic>JXB</italic> online). A longer root would most probably facilitate water absorption from deeper soils especially when water shortages occur, thus strengthening drought tolerance and increasing biomass and yield. In this study, the silique sizes and yield per plant of <italic>TaSnRK2.4</italic> transformants were much larger than those of the WT contols (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5B, C</xref>), further suggesting that use of <italic>TaSnRK2.4</italic> might be feasible in enhancing yield. Stomatal dynamics are key in reducing water loss and allowing entry of carbon dioxide for photosynthesis. Compelling evidence in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> indicates that AtSnRK2.6/AtSnRK2E/OST1 can integrate ABA signals and osmotic stress, and is involved in ABA-dependent stomatal regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mustilli <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yoshida <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>).The width, length, area, and density of stomata, as well as the area ratio of stomata to leaf were measured, and no obvious differences were identified (data not shown), showing that <italic>TaSnRK2.4</italic> does not participate in the regulation of stomatal development and aperture.</p></sec><sec><title>Physiological changes in transgenic TaSnRK2.4 plants under various conditions</title><p>Environmental stresses often cause physiological changes in plants. Physiological indices, including CMS, OP, RWC, and chlorophyll fluorescence, are typical physiological parameters for evaluating abiotic stress tolerance and resistance in crop plants. In general, plants with higher CMS, RWC, OP, and photosynthetic capacities have enhanced tolerance or resistance to environmental stresses.</p><p>RWC and detached-leaf water loss rate are essential parameters of water status in plants and have been proposed as important indicators of water status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Clarke <italic>et al.</italic>, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dhanda and Sethi, 1998</xref>). RWC is closely related to cell volume and may more closely reflect the balance between water supply to leaves and transpiration rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Farquhar <italic>et al.</italic>, 1989</xref>). In the present work, the detached-leaf water loss rate of <italic>TaSnRK2.4 Arabidopsis</italic> was lower than that of the WT and GFP controls, and the final RWCs for <italic>TaSnRK2.4</italic> seedlings were significantly higher than those of the controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7</xref>), strongly indicating that the transgenic lines had higher water retention ability.</p><p>Plant survival depends on maintaining positive turgor pressure, which is important for cell expansion and stomatal opening. A decrease in water availability induced by osmotic stress might lead to turgor reduction. Osmotic adjustment (OA) is a fundamental cell tolerance response to osmotic stress, and can be realized by the accumulation of diverse osmoprotectants. Generally, a higher capacity for OA means broader adaptation and more tolerance to osmotic stress. OP is a direct reflection of OA capability at the physiological level, and has been used as an effective index to screen crop germplasm for osmotic stress tolerance. Our research indicates the OP of <italic>TaSnRK2.4</italic> lines is significantly higher than that of WT and GFP controls under well-watered conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6</xref>). These results strongly indicated that the increased OP in transgenic plants is due to the overexpression of <italic>TaSnRK2.4</italic>, rather than GFP. Increased OP is primarily attributed to accumulation of osmoprotectants, including amino acids, quaternary amines, and various sugars. It is well documented that proline is the most widely distributed multifunctional osmolyte, occurring not only in plants, but also in many other organisms, and playing important roles in enhancing osmotic stress tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bartels and Sunkar, 2005</xref>). An increase in free proline was not detected in <italic>TaSnRK2.4</italic> plants, suggesting that proline was not the main reason for OP augmentation, and that TaSnRK2.4 was not likely to be involved in the pathway of proline metabolism. Higher OP commonly predicts higher water retention capacity and a lower rate of water loss, as well as higher water use efficiency. The results of OP analysis were consistent with the above-mentioned detached-leaf water loss rate and RWC results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7</xref>), and partially explain the enhanced tolerance to drought, salt, and cold stresses.</p><p>Cell membranes are one of the first targets of many plant stresses. It is generally accepted that the maintenance of membrane integrity and stability under water stress conditions is a major component of environmental stress tolerance in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Levitt, 1980</xref>). CMS has been used for assessing tolerance to frost, heat, and desiccation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Farooq and Azam, 2006</xref>). In most of these studies, CMS exhibits a positive correlation with several physiological and biochemical parameters conditioning plant responses to environmental conditions such as water use efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Franca <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>), stomatal resistance, OP, leaf rolling index, K<sup>+</sup> concentration, OA, and/or RWC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Munns, 2002</xref>). The degree of CMS under environmental stresses can be easily estimated through measurements of electrolyte leakage from cells. In this study, the CMS of <italic>TaSnRK2.4</italic> plants under both osmotic and salinity stresses was higher than that of the WT and GFP controls, clearly demonstrating that CMS enhancement is caused by overexpression of <italic>TaSnRK2.4</italic>. As mentioned above, CMS has a positive relationship with several physiological and biochemical parameters; it predicts that <italic>TaSnRK2.4</italic> plants might have a strong capacity to tolerate environmental stresses, as verified by the functional assay results in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figs 8</xref><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">10</xref>).</p><p>Chlorophyll fluorescence from intact leaves, especially fluorescence induction patterns, is a reliable, non-invasive method for monitoring photosynthetic events and reflects the physiological status of the plant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Strasser <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>). The ratio of variable to maximal fluorescence is an important parameter used to assess the physiological status of the photosynthetic apparatus. It represents the maximum quantum yield of the primary photochemical reaction of PSII. Environmental stresses that affect PSII efficiency are known to provoke decreases in the <italic>F</italic><sub>v</sub>/<italic>F</italic><sub>m</sub> ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Krause and Weis, 1991</xref>).

Several research groups have demonstrated that OST1/SnRK2E/SRK2.6 and <italic>V. faba</italic> AAPK are involved in ABA-dependent stomatal regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mustilli <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yoshida <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Shin <italic>et al.</italic> (2007)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Umezawa <italic>et al.</italic> (2004)</xref> showed that overexpression of AtSnRK2C/AtSnRK2.8 increases the expression of stress-related genes and thus enhances drought tolerance in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Diedhiou <italic>et al.</italic> (2008)</xref> demonstrated that overexpression of <italic>SAPK4</italic> significantly enhanced the salt tolerance of transgenic rice through regulating genes with functions in ion homeostasis and the oxidative stress response. In terms of actual mechanisms, it remains unknown as to how SAPK4 prevents Na<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>&#x02013;</sup> from entering the cell and how the cell maintains ion homeostasis. In the present research, transgenic <italic>TaSnRK2.4</italic> plants were exposed to severe drought, salt, and freeze stresses. The morphological and physiological evidence strongly demonstrated that the transgenic lines acquired strengthened tolerance to severe drought, high salinity, and freezing stresses relative to WT plants. Our understanding is that enhanced multistress tolerance is possibly due to increased osmotic potential. Under water-deficient conditions, enhancement of OP leads to reduced water loss and increased RWC in plant cells, possibly facilitating the enhanced water retention ability, benefiting the maintenance of regular cell turgor, and avoiding damage to cell membranes, thus enhancing drought tolerance. Under salt stress, the higher OP probably prevents entry of harmful ions, including Na<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>&#x02013;</sup>, thus relieving ion damage to cell membranes, and therefore increasing salt tolerance. Under cold stress, higher OP commonly means more solutes in the plant sap, resulting in lower freezing points and hence reduced freezing damage. In the current work, gene expression levels and protein abundance for the two transgenic lines (L4 and L5) were relatively lower than for the other four transgenic lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/erp331/DC1">Supplementary Fig. S1</ext-link> at <italic>JXB</italic> online), whereas their capability of osmotic tolerance was much stronger than that of the latter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8</xref><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">10</xref>). This seems to suggest that the overexpression level is not directly proportional to the ability for abiotic stress resistance, which hints that an appropriate overexpression level should be considered when generating transgenic plants with a regulatory gene controlled by a constitutive overexpressing promoter for improvement of abiotic stress tolerance.</p><p>This study primarily concerned the morphological and physiological features of <italic>TaSnRK2.4</italic> overexpression in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> under normal and adverse conditions.
