It is thought that c-<italic>myb </italic>is part of a genetic switch that allows hematopoietic progenitor cells to choose between alternative fates, such as proliferation, differentiation or apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>The proteins encoded by v-<italic>myb </italic>and c-<italic>myb </italic>(v-Myb and c-Myb) bind to the sequence motif PyAAC(G/T)G [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] and control the expression of a number of genes, such as <italic>mim-1 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], the lysozyme gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], <italic>bcl-2 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], <italic>tom-1 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], <italic>c-kit </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], <italic>GBX2 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], <italic>Pdcd4 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], the genes for neutrophil elastase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and the A2B adenosine receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] among others. Recent microarray analyses have suggested that Myb actually affects the expression of a much larger set of genes, either by direct binding or by indirect mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>Most of the work aimed at understanding how Myb activates the expression of its target genes has focused on the promoter regions of these genes and has provided a relatively simple picture of how Myb affects gene expression. In many cases, Myb binding sites have been identified in the promoter regions of these genes, suggesting that Myb acts primarily on the promoters of its targets. Recent in-depth analyses of some Myb target genes, however, have suggested a more complex picture in which the activation of certain target genes is mediated by cooperation of additional Myb-responsive enhancer elements with the target gene promoters. For example, the expression of the chicken <italic>mim-1 </italic>gene is controlled by interactions of Myb both with the promoter as well as with a powerful cell-specific enhancer located upstream of the gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Similarly, in case of the chicken C/EBP&#x003b2; gene Myb targets the promoter as well as an enhancer located downstream of the gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>Recently, another regulatory DNA element has been mapped close to a Myb-regulated gene. We have shown that chicken <italic>Gas41</italic>, whose promoter region has been known for some time to act as an origin of DNA replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], is a direct Myb target gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Other work has shown that the Myb homolog of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster </italic>is involved in the control of the replication origin responsible for chorion gene amplification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. These observations raised the question of whether DNA replication origins are also associated with other Myb target genes. Here, we demonstrate that the promoter region of the Myb-regulated chicken adenosine receptor 2B gene acts as an origin of DNA replication. Furthermore, we identify the chicken <italic>Mcm4 </italic>gene as a novel Myb target gene and demonstrate that the <italic>Mcm4 </italic>promoter is associated with a replication origin. Besides identifying two new DNA replication origins in chicken cells and a novel Myb-regulated gene our work suggests that a significant fraction of Myb-regulated genes might be associated with DNA replication origins.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>The chicken <italic>Mcm4 </italic>gene is a Myb target gene</title><p>The observation that the promoter of the Myb-regulated the chicken <italic>Gas41 </italic>gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] is associated with an origin of DNA-replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] prompted us to explore the possibility that other Myb target regions also co-localize with DNA replication origins. Ladenburger et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] have previously identified a replication origin located between the human <italic>Mcm4 </italic>and <italic>Prkdc </italic>genes. Both genes are separated from each other by an intergenic region of only 0.8 kb and are transcribed in opposite directions. This arrangement is conserved among humans, mice and chickens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. We noted that the corresponding chicken sequence contains a number of potential Myb binding motifs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). One of the sites (MBS-6) matched exactly to the consensus Myb binding motif PyAAC(G/T)G [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], while the other sites had one (MBS-4, MBS-1) or two (MBS-2, MBS-3 and MBS-5) mismatches. The human <italic>Mcm4</italic>-<italic>Prkdc </italic>intergenic region also contains 8 potential Myb binding motifs although their exact positions are not conserved between the human and the chicken sequence. To demonstrate that Myb recognizes at least some of the motifs found in the chicken sequence those sites (MBS-1, MBS-4 and MBS-6) that showed the best fit to the consensus binding motif were analyzed by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) using recombinant v-Myb protein expressed in bacteria. As illustrated in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, retarded protein-DNA complexes were observed when oligonucleotides containing MBS-1, MBS-4 and MBS-6 were used, demonstrating that v-Myb is able to recognize at least three of the potential binding sites <italic>in vitro</italic>. To confirm the specificity of binding we performed a competition experiment in which binding of v-Myb to a radiolabeled oligonucleotide containing the high affinity Myb binding site A from the <italic>mim-1 </italic>promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] was competed by excess of unlabeled oligonucleotides containing MBS-1, MBS-4 and MBS-6 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). Binding was competed efficiently by the <italic>mim-1 </italic>A site itself but not by a control oligonucleotide containing a C/EBP binding site. Oligonucleotides containing MBS-4 and MBS-6 also competed, although less efficiently that the <italic>mim-1 </italic>A oligonucleotide. MBS-1 appeared not to compete specifically with the <italic>mim-1 </italic>A site. Taken together, this experiment confirmed that v-Myb binds specifically to binding sites 4 and 6 while binding to MBS-1 was quite weak.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Nucleotide sequence of the <italic>Mcm4</italic>-Prkdc intergenic region</bold>.

The cells were formaldehyde-fixed and DNA-protein complexes obtained after sonication were immunoprecipitated with two different antibodies against Myb. As a control, parallel incubations with non-immune serum or with unrelated antibodies were performed. After reverse-crosslinking and purification of the immunoprecipitated DNA the samples were analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR using the primers that bind to the <italic>Mcm4-Prkdc </italic>intergenic region or control primers. The result of the ChIP experiment is illustrated in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>. We observed substantial enrichment of the <italic>Mcm4-Prkdc </italic>intergenic region in samples precipitated with the Myb-specific antibodies, whereas control immunoprecipitations with non-immune sera or unrelated antibodies showed no specific enrichment.

To address this issue we made use of a cell line, designated 10.4, which stably expresses a v-Myb/estrogen receptor fusion protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Upon &#x003b2;-estradiol treatment of 10.4 cells the v-Myb/ER fusion protein is activated and upregulates the expression of a number of Myb target genes. 10.4 cells were cultivated for 24 hours in the presence or absence of 2 &#x003bc;M &#x003b2;-estradiol. Polyadenylated RNA from these cells was then isolated and analyzed by Northern blotting with probes specific for <italic>Mcm4 </italic>or <italic>Prkdc </italic>mRNA. As a control, a probe hybridizing to the ribosomal protein <italic>S17 </italic>mRNA was used. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, the <italic>Mcm4 </italic>mRNA level was elevated in the estrogen-treated 10.4 cells when compared to untreated cells, suggesting that chicken <italic>Mcm4 </italic>is indeed a Myb target gene. By contrast, <italic>Prkdc </italic>was not regulated by v-Myb. 10.4 cells do not express endogenous estrogen receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], suggesting that <italic>Mcm4 </italic>is not simply an estrogen-regulated gene.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>The chicken <italic>Mcm4 </italic>gene is regulated by v-Myb</bold>.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. The nascent strand abundance assay is a powerful and widely used method to identify and map DNA replication origins. The assay is based on the isolation and quantification of single stranded DNA 1&#x02013;2 kb in length (so-called nascent DNA) which is primarily derived from replication origin regions. The method can be performed with asynchronously growing cells and does not depend on the availability of antisera against origin binding proteins (such as Orc- or MCM-proteins). Briefly, nascent DNA 1&#x02013;2 kb in length was isolated from different chicken cells by sucrose gradient sedimentation. Sets of primers mapping to the intergenic region as well as to upstream and downstream sequences were used to determine the abundance of the corresponding sequences in nascent DNA using quantitative real-time PCR. BM2 cells are myeloid v-<italic>myb </italic>transformed cells that express high levels of the v-Myb protein. HD11 cells are myeloid cells that do not express v-Myb or c-Myb. DT40 is a line of B-lymphoid cells that express c-Myb. Finally, we used a subclone of the DT40 line in which the c-<italic>myb </italic>gene had been disrupted by homologous recombination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. As illustrated in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> the <italic>Mcm4-Prkdc </italic>intergenic region was enriched in nascent DNA in each of these cell lines. This demonstrated that this region acts as a DNA replication origin also in chicken cells. We did not observe significant differences in the abundance of the origin region between myeloid cells expressing (BM2) or not expressing (HD11) v-Myb. Although the abundance of the origin region was higher in DT40 cells compared to myeloid cells, there was no significant difference between wild-type and c-Myb deficient DT40 cells. Thus, although Myb binds to the intergenic region and stimulates <italic>Mcm4 </italic>expression, it does not affect the activity of the replication origin.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Replication origin activity of the <italic>Mcm4-Prkdc </italic>intergenic region in chicken cells.

To address this question we used two different strategies: i.) We examined the promoter regions of known Myb-regulated genes for replication origin activity using the nascent strand abundance assay. ii.) We investigated the activity of v-Myb at the <italic>Mcm4-Prkdc </italic>intergenic region, which harbors several potential Myb binding sites and is associated with a replication origin in human cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>Analysis of the adenosine receptor 2B gene, a known Myb target gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], showed that the sequences around the 5' end of the gene were enriched in preparations of nascent DNA. This observation strongly suggested that the promoter of the A2B receptor co-localizes with a DNA replication origin. A further case of such co-localization was revealed by the analysis of the <italic>Mcm4-Prkdc </italic>intergenic region. Our data showed that v-Myb binds to this region both in vitro and in vivo and stimulates transcription of the chicken <italic>Mcm4 </italic>gene. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the <italic>Mcm4-Prkdc </italic>intergenic region is a replication origin also in chicken cells. Thus, chicken <italic>Mcm4 </italic>is a novel v-Myb target gene whose promoter region is also associated with a DNA replication origin. As these examples show, Myb-regulated genes and replication origins co-localize in some cases. However, it is also evident from the limited number of genes that have been analyzed so far that not every Myb target gene promoter is associated with a replication origin. For example, the promoter region of the <italic>mim-1 </italic>gene does not possess replication origin activity.</p><p>In the light of the co-localization of replication origins with several promoters containing clusters of Myb binding sites we wondered how frequently such clusters occur in the chicken genome. We screened approximately three million basepairs of randomly selected chicken genomic sequences for the presence of clusters of Myb binding motifs (AACG or AACTG) that are similar to those found at the MCM4, Adora2b and Gas41 replication origins. While on the average one such motif is present per 200 base pairs we found that clusters of at least six of such sites within stretches of 250 base pairs occur only once per approximately 25 kb. Although the number of such binding motif clusters is higher than the estimated number of replication origins in the chicken genome (one replication origin per approximately 100 kb, as extrapolated from mammalian cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]), it appears unlikely that the concurrence of clusters of Myb binding motifs and DNA replication origins reported here is purely accidental. It will therefore be interesting to examine such clusters of Myb binding motifs for their potential role as replication origins.</p><p>The functional consequences, if any, of such co-localization are unclear at present. We have not observed that v-Myb or c-Myb influence the activity of the replication origins identified here. v-Myb or c-Myb, therefore, appear not to be involved in the control of origin activity. Recent work on the Myb homolog (Dm-Myb) of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster </italic>has provided evidence that Dm-Myb performs a non-transcriptional role in the control of the replication origin responsible for chorion gene amplification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Furthermore, it has been shown that some of the phenotypic consequences of mutation of Dm-Myb can be compensated by B-Myb, but not by c-Myb or A-Myb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. It is therefore conceivable that B-Myb plays a role at the replication origins identified here. Another interesting possibility is that rather than being regulated by Myb the presence of a replication origin might affect the activation of the associated gene by Myb. For example, compacted chromatin structures will be opened during replication thereby providing transcription factors access to the DNA. It is therefore possible that the association with a replication origin imposes an additional level of control onto the adjacent gene, which would be expected to be cell cycle dependent. It is presently not known whether the <italic>Mcm4 </italic>and <italic>Adora2B </italic>genes are expressed in a cell cycle dependent manner. However, in this respect it is interesting to note that the phenotypic changes of myeloid cells transformed by a temperature-sensitive version of v-Myb that accompany activation of v-Myb by down-shifting the cells from the non-permissive to the permissive temperature were not observed when DNA replication was inhibited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. This observation is consistent with the idea that the activation of at least some Myb-regulated genes depends on DNA replication. Clearly, further work is necessary until we can discern which of these possibilities, if any, is right.</p><p>Independent of a possible role of DNA replication origins in Myb-inducible gene expression our work is also of interest because we have identified two novel replication origins in chicken cells. So far, only very few replication origins are known in chicken cells, such as the origins located in the alpha and beta globin gene clusters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] and between the lysozyme and <italic>Gas41 </italic>genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. It is also interesting to note that the origin in the <italic>Mcm4-Prkdc </italic>intergenic region has been conserved between between chickens and humans.</p><p>Another interesting aspect of our work is the identification of the chicken <italic>Mcm4 </italic>gene as a Myb-regulated gene. MCM4, together with other MCM proteins, forms the hexameric MCM2-7 complex which functions as helicase during the S-phase of the cell cycle. The MCM2-7 complex is loaded onto the DNA prior to the initiation of DNA replication and constitutes an essential part of the pre-replication complex [for reviews see: [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]]. In addition to acting as a helicase in concert with the other MCM proteins forming the MCM2-7 complex there is evidence that MCM4 also performs a specific regulatory role. MCM4 is extensively phosphorylated when cells are exposed to inhibitors of DNA synthesis or to UV irradiation, leading to a block of DNA fork progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], suggesting that MCM4 plays a role in the DNA replication block checkpoint system. In the normal course of the cell cycle MCM4 is phosphorylated by Cdk2, leading to the inhibition of the helicase function of the MCM complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Blockage of this phosphorylation leads to reinitiation of replication and genomic instability. These observations suggest that MCM4 is a key component of the MCM complex whose manipulation can influence the control of DNA replication and genomic stability. Interestingly, elevated <italic>Mcm4 </italic>mRNA levels have been found in certain tumors, suggesting that increased <italic>Mcm4 </italic>expression can contribute to the malignant properties of the tumor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Recently, a hypomorph allele of mouse <italic>Mcm4 </italic>was identified and shown to cause chromosomal instability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Thus, <italic>Mcm4 </italic>is an interesting novel Myb target gene that provides a possible link between Myb, DNA-replication and checkpoint control.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have identified the chicken <italic>Mcm4 </italic>gene as a novel Myb-regulated gene and shown that the <italic>Mcm4 </italic>promoter region is associated with an origin of DNA replication. Similarly, our work shows that the promoter of the Myb-regulated adenosine receptor 2B gene co-localizes with a replication origin. Our work raises the possibility that a fraction of Myb target gene promoters is associated with DNA replication origins.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>The BM2 and HD11 are lines of AMV-transformed chicken myeloblasts and MC29-transformed macrophages that were originally obtained from C.

To produce a calibration curve, the C<sub>T </sub>value of each sample was plotted against the logarithm of its concentration. The number of genomic equivalents of each target sequence in the nascent DNA strand samples was then determined by extrapolation from the calibration curve. Several conditions were met by each assayed sample: The slope of the standard curve was around 3 to 3.5 (indicating a PCR efficiency close to 100 %). The sample was diluted such that its genomic equivalents fell within the central part of the calibration curve. The melting curve profile showed a single PCR product. The specificity of the PCR products was additionally confirmed for each primer pair by agarose gel electrophoresis.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>HG carried out the in vitro DNA binding and nascent strand abundance assays.
