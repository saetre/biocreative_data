The murine CYP7A1 gene is highly inducible by thyroid hormone <italic>in vivo</italic> and there is an inverse relationship between thyroid hormone and serum cholesterol. Eventhough gene expression has been shown to be upregulated, whether the induction was mediated through a direct effect of thyroid hormone on the CYP7A1 promoter has never been established. Using gene targeted mice, we show that either of the two TR isoforms are sufficient to maintain normal hepatic CYP7A1 expression but a loss of both results in a significant decrease in expression. We also identified two new functional thyroid hormone receptor-binding sites in the CYP7A1 5&#x02032; flanking sequence located 3 kb upstream from the transcription start site. One site is a DR-0, which is an unusual type of TR response element, and the other consists of only a single recognizable half site that is required for TR/retinoid X receptor (RXR) binding. These two independent TR-binding sites are closely spaced and both are required for full induction of the CYP7A1 promoter by thyroid hormone, although the DR-0 site was more crucial.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Cholesterol 7&#x003b1; hydroxlyase (CYP7A1) catalyzes the initial and rate-limiting step in the neutral synthetic pathway of bile acids from cholesterol. Because the bile acid synthetic pathway is a major route to remove excess cholesterol from the body, CYP7A1 is considered an important enzyme in cholesterol homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>). CYP7A1 is exclusively expressed in the liver and the gene is subject to metabolic regulation by oxysterols, bile acids, hormones, nutrients and cytokines. In mice and rats, CYP7A1 is activated by cholesterol excess through by product oxysterols that function as ligand agonists for the liver X receptor (LXR)/retinoid X receptor (RXR) heterodimer which binds to direct repeats of half sites separated by 4 nt (DR-4, LXRE) in the CYP7A1 promoter, increasing expression of CYP7A1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>). Conversely, bile acids inhibit CYP7A1 gene expression through a negative feed back mechanism operating through several molecular pathways. In one pathway, bile acids activate the farnesoid X receptor (FXR), which in turn induces expression of the small heterodimer partner (SHP). SHP binds to and interferes with the activity of the &#x003b1;1-fetoprotein transcription factor (FTF-1, also called LRH-1), leading to an inhibition of CYP7A1 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>). Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 (HNF-4) has also been shown to mediate bile acid-induced repression of CYP7A1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). In fasted mouse livers and in type I diabetic mice, PPAR-&#x003b3;-coactivator one alpha (PGC-1&#x003b1;) plays an important role in activating CYP7A1 gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>). Additionally, CYP7A1 expression is regulated by thyroid hormone through a direct effect on gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>).</p><p>Thyroid hormone mediates its action through the thyroid hormone receptor (TR), a member of the nuclear receptor superfamily of ligand-dependent transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>). There are two major isoforms of TR generated by different genes, TR&#x003b2; and TR&#x003b1;. Each isoform exhibits a distinct pattern of tissue and developmental expression and there are multiple transcripts from each TR gene. TR&#x003b2; is the primary isoform in the liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). TR binds to specific DNA sequences, TR response elements (TREs), as monomers, homodimers, or with RXR in a heterodimer. Since RXR enhances the binding affinity of TR to TRE, TR/RXR heterodimers have been suggested to be major protein complexes that mediate thyroid hormone responses <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). Through the use of synthetic DNA and <italic>in vitro</italic> DNA-binding studies, a high affinity consensus element for TR was determined to be the DR-4 motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>). However, naturally occurring TREs diverge significantly from this consensus and many consist of different orientations and configurations of repeats of the nuclear receptor half site AGGTCA half site. This can vary from a single half site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>) to a DR-0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>), palindromes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>) and multiple separate and variably spaced direct repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>).</p><p>The association of hypothyroidism with hypercholesterolemia was first recognized in 1930 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>). This thyroid hormone effect is thought to be through direct regulation of target genes of cholesterol metabolism at the transcriptional level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>). Cholesterol homeostasis is maintained through cooperative regulation of cholesterol uptake and <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis together with cholesterol catabolism to bile acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>). Accordingly, our previous studies have shown that thyroid hormone directly up-regulates expression of sterol regulatory element binding protein-2 (SREBP-2), which in turn increases expression of low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), resulting in a decrease in plasma cholesterol levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>).</p><p>Cholesterol catabolism is also modulated by thyroid hormone primarily through changes in CYP7A1 mRNA levels. CYP7A1 mRNA is induced rapidly within 1 h of triiodothyronine (T3) treatment in hypophysectomized rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>) and T3 treatment also increases the rate of CYP7A1 gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>). This rapid induction suggests that the increase in CYP7A1 mRNA may be directly mediated by thyroid hormone at the transcriptional level. In addition, induction of CYP7A1 expression by T3 was blunted in TR&#x003b2; knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>) and knock-in mice where a mutant TR&#x003b2; was inserted that has a defect in ligand binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>). These studies argue strongly for a direct action of TR on CYP7A1. Indeed, protein&#x02013;DNA-binding studies have shown direct binding of TR/RXR to the proximal DR-4 of the CYP7A1 promoter which has been characterized as an LXRE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>). However, whether this proximal site or any other TR-binding site(s) in the promoter is responsible for TR responsiveness has not been established. In the current study, we have identified two closely spaced TREs in thefar upstream region of the CYP7A1 promoter that are responsible for the CYP7A1 stimulation by T3. Both these TRE were required for full induction of T3 and unlike some TREs, these CYP7A1 T3 response elements do not respond to LXR signaling.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Animal treatments</title><p>All animals used in this study were acquired and maintained in accordance with the NIH Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.

Therefore, a fragment of the 5&#x02032;-flanking region of the rat CYP7A1 promoter from &#x02212;3640 to +59 (pGL3R7&#x003b1;-3640) was fused to the luciferase reporter gene and tested for T3 responsiveness in co-transfection assays in HepG2 cells. The HepG2 cell-based co-transfection assay has been established to evaluate T3 regulation of other genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>). In this assay, expression vectors for TR&#x003b2; and RXR&#x003b1; were co-transfected with pGL3R7&#x003b1;-3640 into HepG2 cells that were subsequently cultured in the presence or absence of T3 and the activity of the reporter gene was measured. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, T3 treatment resulted in a 21-fold increase in the activity of pGL3R7&#x003b1;-3640. In contrast, when T3 was added without the expression constructs or if the TR&#x003b2; and RXR&#x003b1; expression vectors were added without T3, there was only minimal promoter activity. As a control, the activity of murine leukemia virus luciferase (MLVLuc) reporter, a known T3 responsive promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>), was also activated significantly in response to T3 in these studies. These data suggest that the CYP7A1 promoter is T3 responsive and that TRE(s) directly mediating the response are located within the 3640 bases flanking the 5&#x02032; end of the transcription start site.</p><p>To identify the TRE(s), a series of progressive 5&#x02032; deletions of the promoter were prepared and tested for T3 responsiveness as above. Truncation from &#x02212;3640 to &#x02212;3382, or to &#x02212;3132 caused no significant change in T3 responsiveness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). However, deletion to &#x02212;3008 resulted in a marked decrease in T3 activation from 24.8- to 3.9-fold. Further deletion down to &#x02212;1667 showed a modest drop of T3 activation to 2- to 3-fold of the basal promoter activity observed in pGL3R7&#x003b1;-342. A modest increase in promoter activity by 2- to 3-fold has been shown for the empty pGL3-basic vector in the presence and absence of T3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>) and was not considered to represent specific T3 response. These results suggest that a T3 responsive region is located at 3000 bp 5&#x02032; to the CYP7A1 mRNA start site.</p></sec><sec><title>Identification of thyroid hormone receptor-binding sites in the CYP7A1 promoter</title><p>Using synthetic response and binding elements, it was shown that TR preferentially binds to a site containing two direct repeats of hexameric half sites of AGGTCA spaced by 4 nt. However, naturally occurring TR-binding sites are diverse with respect to the sequence and orientation of the halfsites, and the number of nucleotides in the spacer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). When we scanned the &#x02212;3000 region of the promoter for nuclear receptor half sites, two DR motifs were found: one consisting of a single half site, designated TRE1, and the other consisting of two direct repeats of the half site with no spacer, designated TRE2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Importantly, although the sequence of the mouse and rat promoters diverge significantly in this region of the promoter, the TRE1 is moderately conserved and TRE2 is exactly identical.</p><p>To evaluate whether these putative TREs directly bind TR, gel shift assays were performed using <sup>32</sup>P-labeled oligonucleotides containing either TRE1 or TRE2 with <italic>in vitro</italic> translated TR&#x003b1;, TR&#x003b2; and RXR&#x003b1; protein. Heterodimers of both TR&#x003b1;/RXR&#x003b1; or TR&#x003b2;/RXR&#x003b1; formed complexes with oligonucleotide probes containing either TRE1 and TRE2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and C, lanes 5 and 6). A 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled wild-type TRE1 or a consensus TRE, DR-4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>), efficiently competed out TR&#x003b2;/RXR&#x003b1; for binding to TRE1 (lanes 7 and 8). A 2-base mutation in the 5&#x02032; half site of either TRE disrupted binding of TR&#x003b2;/RXR&#x003b1; with DNA (lanes 13 and 14). Consistently, unlabeled mutant probe (mTRE1 or mTRE2) was not able to compete out TR&#x003b2;/RXR&#x003b1; for the binding to the respective TRE (lane 9) and similar protein&#x02013;DNA complexes were observed for the consensus DR-4 site that was used as a positive control. Taken together, these results suggest that TR/RXR binds independently to both TRE1 and TRE2.</p></sec><sec><title>TRE1 and TRE2 are responsible for the TR response of CYP7A1</title><p>To determine whether TRE1 or TRE2 contribute to the T3 stimulation of the CYP7A1 promoter, point mutations identical to the bases mutated in the gel shift assays were introduced into either the TRE1 or TRE2 or both simultaneously in the pGL3R7&#x003b1;-3640 and pGL3R7&#x003b1;-3132 reporter plasmids by site-directed mutagenesis. The mutant constructs were then examined for T3 responsiveness as described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. A mutation in TRE1 of pGL3R7&#x003b1;-3640 caused a 61% decrease in T3 response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), compared to its respective wild-type promoter, but it retained a significant amount of the T3 response. Similarly, mutation of TRE1 of pGL3R7&#x003b1;-3132 reduced T3 mediated-promoter activity by 46%, compared to its respective wild-type promoter. When a mutation was introduced into the TRE2, the mutant construct displayed almost no response to T3. The complete loss of T3 responsiveness was also observed for the TRE1/TRE2 double mutant. These data suggest that both of the TREs contribute to the T3 responsiveness, although TRE2 appears to be more critical.</p><p>To test the ability of these specific TREs to confer T3 stimulation to an otherwise non-responsive promoter the short region containing &#x02212;3132 to &#x02212;3008 that harbors both TREs was ligated to pGL3R7&#x003b1;-342 to generate pGL3R7&#x003b1;-3132/342. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, addition of this small fragment containing both TREs to the &#x02212;342 promoter resulted in an 18-fold increase in response to T3 which was similar to the full-length &#x02212;3640 construct. As expected, expression from the simple pGL3R7&#x003b1;-342 construct was insensitive to T3.</p></sec><sec><title>TRE1/TRE2 do not mediate an LXR response</title><p>Because TR and LXR both prefer binding to DR-4 elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>) and because there is a DR-4 in the proximal murine CYP7A1 promoter that is responsive to LXR signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>), we evaluated whether these newly identified TREs might also contribute to LXR activation of CYP7A1. pGL3R7&#x003b1;-3132/WT, pGL3R7&#x003b1;-3132/mTRE1,2 or pGL3R7&#x003b1;-3008/WTwere co-transfected with expression vectors for LXR&#x003b1; and RXR&#x003b1; in the presence or absence of GW3695, a synthetic agonist for LXR. The results from these experiments were compared with those for T3 responsiveness of the same constructs. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, the potent stimulation by LXR was not affected by mutations in or loss of either TRE1 or TRE2.</p></sec><sec><title>Recruitment of TR&#x003b2; into the TREs in H4IIE cells</title><p>To directly evaluate if TR&#x003b2; is capable of binding the TREs of the CYP7A1 promoter on the endogenous CYP7A1 gene in cellular chromatin, a ChIP study was performed in H4IIE cells. These cells have been used as a useful system tostudy regulation of gene expression by thyroid hormone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>) and has been used successfully to demonstrate that TR binds to TR target genes using the ChIP technique. Because TR has been shown to bind in chromatin in the presence or absence of its ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>), we made chromatin from H4IIE cells cultured under normal conditions without T3. After crosslinking with formaldehyde, aliquots were immunoprecipitated with anti-TR&#x003b2; or a control mouse IgG fraction and binding to specific chromatin sites was analyzed by a quantitative PCR protocol. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, TR&#x003b2; was efficiently recruited to the &#x02212;3000 region of the CYP7A1 promoter (8-fold compared to a non-specific IgG control). Although the proximal DR-4 does not mediate a T3 response, TR was shown to be recruited to this proximal LXR responsive DR-4 in a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>). Therefore, we also evaluated TR binding to the proximal promoter as well where a modest 2-fold binding enrichment of TR was observed. As a negative control, TR binding to a non-relevant region of the genome was also evaluated and shown to be negative (the YY1 locus). These data demonstrate that TR&#x003b2; is specifically recruited to the &#x02212;3000 TREs of the CYP7A1 promoter in cellular chromatin where the two TREs identified in our study are located.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Thyroid hormone influences many aspects of hepatic metabolism, and the rate controlling enzyme of neutral bile acid metabolism, CYP7A1, was shown to be activated at the transcriptional level by thyroid hormone <italic>in vivo</italic> in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>). However, no functional TRE(s) capable of conferring T3 responsiveness to CYP7A1 had been identified previously. Using transient transfection assays and DNA-binding studies, we have identified two TREs that are responsible for the T3 stimulation of the murine CYP7A1 gene. The two TREs are closely spaced and located in a far upstream region of the promoter at 3 kb upstream relative to the transcription start site.</p><p>TREs are generally found in the proximal region of promoters, as for the rat growth hormone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>), rat malic enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>), myelin basic protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>) and &#x003b1;-myosin heavy chain genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>). However, there are some TREs that are located in a far upstream 5&#x02032; region. For example, the TREs of the rat Spot 14 and chicken malic enzyme genes are located 2.7 and 3.8 kb upstream of the respective transcription start sites, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>). These natural TREs are often clustered and arranged with multiple repeats of the half site, functioning synergistically or cooperatively. Similarly, the two closely spaced TREs are located 3 kb upstream from the CYP7A1 mRNA start site and are both necessary for full responsiveness to T3, although the TRE2 plays a more crucial role in T3 stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>We also examined the recruitment of TR&#x003b2; to the TREs and DR-4 (LXRE) of the endogenous CYP7A1 in H4IIE cells. Our finding of greater recruitment of TR&#x003b2; to the &#x02212;3 kb TREs compared to the proximal DR-4 (LXRE) is consistent with the data from transfection assays where the distal TREs mediate a strong T3 response. This would likely occur when the affinity of TR binding simply reflects the functional augmentation of the T3 response. It is also possible that LXR may be more abundant than TR in H4IIE cells such that the DR-4 (LXRE) may be preferentially occupied by LXR/RXR rather than TR/RXR. Regardless, the presence of the proximal DR-4 is not sufficient to provide a significant response to T3 stimulation.</p><p>We have also shown that either TR&#x003b1; or TR&#x003b2; appears sufficient for normal expression of CYP7A1 when animals are euthyroid and maintained on a chow diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). However, when both receptors are gone there is a significant decrease in CYP7A1 mRNA. In contrast, expression of the 5&#x02032; deiodinase gene specifically requires TR&#x003b2; under these conditions. Thus, either TR isoform appears capable of sustaining basal CYP7A1 expression. It is important to note that earlier reports showed that TR&#x003b2; was key to activating CYP7A1 under dietary and pharmacological manipulation that dramatically alter thyroid hormone levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>). There is a significant increase in CYP7A1 mRNA in the TR&#x003b1; knockout mice suggesting that this receptor may function as a negative regulator of CYP7A1 when TR&#x003b2; is also present. Alternatively, this result may be due to other secondary effects that result from the loss of TR&#x003b1;.</p><p>Using synthetically designed promoter constructs, a consensus DR-4 element was shown to be a potent TRE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>). However, as mentioned above, TREs found in natural promoters are quite diverse in sequence, and the number and orientation of the individual half sites are variable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). TRE1 contains only a mutation sensitive single TR half site. <italic>In vitro</italic> protein&#x02013;DNA-binding assays in the present studies revealed that both of the TREs bind to TR/RXR heterodimers and no significant binding of monomers or homodimers of TR or RXR was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). An extensive mutagenesis analysis failed to identify a crucial second half site for TRE1 (data not shown). The TRE2 is a DR0 which is similar to the TRE of the PEPCK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). Although TR can bind to TRE as a monomer, homodimer or heterodimer with RXR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>), it is likely that the TR/RXR heterodimer binds to the TRE preferentially to mediate T3 response <italic>in vivo</italic> because both TR and RXR were required for efficient binding and both TR and RXR are required for activation as shown in other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>).</p><p>The two TRE's identified here in the rat CYP7A1 are conserved in the mouse promoter eventhough the surrounding sequence is not highly conserved, suggesting there is evolutionary pressure to preserve the T3 response in these two species. In an earlier study, expression of the human CYP7A1 gene was not stimulated by T3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>). Additionally, the distal TR-binding sites we identified in the murine promoters do not seem to be conserved in the human gene and expression of a human transgene containing a large segment of 5&#x02032; flanking DNA in mice was not regulated by T3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>). Additionally, the proximal DR-4 (LXRE) is not conserved in the human gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>) and if anything, the human CYP7A1 may in fact be negatively regulated by T3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>) through a putative negative TRE at &#x02212;227 to &#x02212;247 in the promoter. Taken in total, the data suggest there are significant species differences in the effects of thyroid hormone on lipid metabolism that need to be explored further.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Dr Roy Weiss (U.

Equal amounts (20 &#x000b5;g) of total RNA from individual animals was loaded in separate lanes and analyzed by northern analysis to measure mRNA levels for CYP7A1 and 5&#x02032;DI.
