In this study, we identify the bHLH transcription factor Twist-2 as a key negative regulator of myeloid lineage development, as manifested by marked increases in mature myeloid populations of macrophages, neutrophils, and basophils in Twist-2&#x02013;deficient mice. Mechanistic studies demonstrate that Twist-2 inhibits the proliferation as well as differentiation of granulocyte macrophage progenitors (GMP) by interacting with and inhibiting the transcription factors Runx1 and C/EBP&#x003b1;. Moreover, Twist-2 was found to have a contrasting effect on cytokine production: inhibiting the production of proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-12 (IL-12) and interferon-&#x003b3; (IFN&#x003b3;) while promoting the regulatory cytokine IL-10 by myeloid cells. The data from further analyses suggest that Twist-2 activates the transcription factor c-Maf, leading to IL-10 expression. In addition, Twist-2 was found to be essential for endotoxin tolerance. Thus, this study reveals the critical role of Twist-2 in regulating the development of myeloid lineages, as well as the function and inflammatory responses of mature myeloid cells.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>Hematopoiesis is coordinated by transcription factors that regulate proliferation, differentiation, and cell fate determinations.

Cell fates are established by master transcription factors that orchestrate determination and differentiation.

Transcription factors, including PU.1 and C/EBP&#x003b1;, play critical roles in development of myeloid lineages because in the absence of these factors, specific populations fail to develop or are severely altered. PU.1 plays a broad role in determination of both myeloid and lymphoid lineages, as mice deficient in PU.1 fail to develop B cells, T cells, granulocytes, or macrophages &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060316-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;.

Although many transcription factors have been identified that play critical roles in promoting myeloid lineage development, factors that naturally function to inhibit or negatively regulate myeloid lineage development are largely unknown and require further characterization. These inhibitory factors may play equally important roles in regulating hematopoiesis by preventing excessive myeloid lineage development or myeloproliferative disease. Furthermore, aberrant expression of inhibitory factors, as exemplified by the Runx1-ETO fusion protein, which functions as a dominant-negative regulator of the transcription factor Runx1 and an inhibitor of the C/EBP&#x003b1; promoter &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060316-b015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060316-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;, may play a direct role in leukemogenesis by blocking normal differentiation and creating an enlarged pool of progenitors that are prone to malignant transformation.</p><p>Importantly, many basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors, including the E2A family, stem cell leukemia factor (SCL/Tal1), Lyl-1, and the helix-loop-helix (HLH) Id family, are known to be important regulators of hematopoiesis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060316-b017">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060316-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;. bHLH factors form heterodimers or homodimers that can bind E-box DNA consensus sites comprised of the sequence 5&#x02032;-CANNTG-3&#x02032;.

Furthermore, in general, very few intrinsic negative regulators of myeloid lineage development have been identified.

Twist-2 KO mice have increased percentages and absolute cell counts of multiple myeloid lineages, including a 2&#x02013;3-fold increase in macrophages and neutrophils as well as an 18-fold increase in absolute basophil count (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0060316-t001">Table 1</xref>). There was no apparent change in absolute lymphocyte, red blood cell, or platelet counts in peripheral blood, suggesting that other lineages, including megakaryocyte and erythroid lineages, were not significantly affected. Histology of whole bone mounts demonstrated a largely intact architecture of the trabecular bone in Twist-2 KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060316-g001">Figure 1</xref>G, left panel). Histological analysis of Twist-2 KO BM revealed increases in myeloid cells in multiple stages of maturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060316-g001">Figure 1</xref>G, right panel and arrows), which is consistent with the CD11b<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>Gr-1<sup>high</sup> phenotype of the expanded myeloid populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060316-g001">Figure 1</xref>C&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060316-g001">1</xref>F).

Splenocytes from Twist-2 KO and WT littermates were cultured in complete media and stimulated with proapoptotic cytokines. Cells were then analyzed by flow cytometry with staining for Annexin-V and propidium iodide (PI). Twist-2 KO CD11b<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>Gr-1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells did not show any increased resistance to cell death. In fact, there was a slightly increased susceptibility to apoptosis as indicated by the increased percentage of Annexin-V<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>PI<sup>&#x02212;</sup> Twist-2 KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060316-g002">Figure 2</xref>A).

Thus, it is unlikely that the increased populations of myeloid cells we observed in Twist-2 KO mice are due to decreased cell turnover or resistance to apoptosis in these populations. Another possibility is that a change in cell trafficking may result in relative increases of these myeloid cells in specific organs or tissues at the expense of others. However, this possibility was largely excluded due to the observed increases in multiple tissues and organs of Twist-2 KO mice, including the BM. The possibility of increased myeloid cells as a result of infection was also unlikely, due to the lack of evidence of infection in these mice and to their housing in a pathogen-free barrier facility. Next, we examined the possibility that altered or dysregulated hematopoiesis in Twist-2 KO mice results in increased production or myeloproliferation.</p><fig id="pbio-0060316-g002" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Increased Myeloid Progenitors in Twist-2&#x02013;Deficient Mice</title><p>(A) Flow cytometry of splenocytes cultured in complete medium and stimulated with TNF&#x003b1; (5 &#x003bc;g/ml) for 24 h.

In order to address this possibility, COS7 cells were transfected with constructs encoding FLAG-tagged Twist-2 and Myc-tagged Runx1. Upon immunoprecipitation of Runx1, we detected Flag-tagged Twist-2 by coimmunoprecipitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060316-g004">Figure 4</xref>A). To investigate the functionality of this interaction, COS7 cells were transfected with a Runx-dependent luciferase reporter construct containing four core binding factor consensus sites. Interestingly, we observed a basal level of reporter activity in COS7 cells, which could be due to a low-level endogenous expression of Runx family members. Cotransfection of Twist-2 resulted in a significant dose-response inhibition of Runx1 reporter activity that was able to reduce the promoter activity to near basal levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060316-g004">Figure 4</xref>B).

To investigate the molecular mechanism by which Twist-2 promotes IL-10 production, we first used an IL-10 promoter-driven luciferase reporter assay. It was observed that Twist-2 did not enhance the IL-10 promoter-derived transcription (unpublished data). Several recent studies have demonstrated that the transcription factor c-Maf is important for the transcription of IL-10 as well as IL-4 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060316-b049">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060316-b050">50</xref>&#x0005d;.

To further investigate this possibility, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays using 3T3 fibroblasts which express high levels of Twist-2. We found that primers (pair 1) specific for a highly conserved E-box&#x02013;containing region of the c-Maf promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060316-g006">Figure 6</xref>B) generated bands from both the RNA-positive control and anti-Twist-2 antibody pulldown, but not control antibody pulldown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060316-g006">Figure 6</xref>C). In contrast, negative control primers (pair 2) specific for a region of genomic DNA approx 20 kb upstream of the <italic>c-Maf</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060316-g006">Figure 6</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060316-g006">6</xref>C) did not show significant pulldown with any antibody.

We further found that Twist-2 not only inhibits the myeloid differentiation of GMP, but also inhibits the proliferation of GMP population. Moreover, we demonstrated that Twist-2 has inhibitory effects on the activity of Runx1 and C/EBP&#x003b1;, which may contribute to the suppression of GMP differentiation and proliferation by Twist-2. Thus, this study reveals the critical, unrecognized role for Twist-2 in negative regulation of GMP proliferation and myeloid lineage differentiation. In addition, we found that Twist-2 regulates the function and inflammatory responses of differentiated myeloid cells by promoting the production of the important regulatory cytokine IL-10 and inhibiting the production of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines.</p><p>Twist-1 and Twist-2 are highly conserved; however, deficiency in Twist-1 and Twist-2 results in different phenotypes: Twist-1 KO mice are embryonic lethal due to a failure in neural tube closure, whereas Twist-2 KO mice develop a severe inflammatory syndrome and die within 2 wk of birth &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060316-b035">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060316-b052">52</xref>&#x0005d;.

In this study, we found that Twist-2 inhibited the function of the transcription factor Runx1, which may contribute to the myeloproliferative disease observed in Twist-2 KO mice. In addition, Runx1 is a target of one of the most common translocations t(8;21) in acute myeloid leukemia (AML), which generates the dominant-negative Runx1-ETO fusion protein to suppress Runx1 activity, leading to the blockade of myeloid lineage differentiation and an accumulated progenitor pool that is prone to malignant transformation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060316-b060">60</xref>&#x0005d;. In addition, C/EBP&#x003b1;, a member of the basic region&#x02013;leucine zipper CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) transcription factors, is a potent inhibitor of cell cycle in myeloid cells and other types of cells due to binding E2F1. Thus, the suppression of GMP proliferation by Twist-2 may be due to the inhibition of C/EBP&#x003b1;. However, it is possible that Twist-2 interacts with and suppresses additional unrecognized factors. Taken together, our results suggest that Twist-2 suppresses the differentiation and proliferation of GMP, possibly via the inhibition of the transcription factors Runx1 and C/EBP&#x003b1;.</p><p>An interesting unexpected finding of this study is that Twist-2 promotes the production of the important regulatory cytokine IL-10 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060316-b065">65</xref>&#x0005d; by differentiated myeloid cells. The etiology of the lethal inflammatory phenotype of Twist-2 KO mice is distinct, but not well understood &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060316-b035">35</xref>&#x0005d;. The enhanced production of proinflammatory cytokines in combination with the reduced production of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 may contribute to the lethal inflammation of Twist-2 KO mice &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060316-b035">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060316-b036">36</xref>&#x0005d;. In addition, hyperproliferation of myeloid progenitors and the expanded population of differentiated inflammatory myeloid cells found in Twist-2 KO mice may perpetuate the lethal inflammation. Different from the constitutive expression of Twist-2 in GMP, the expression of Twist-2 in differentiated myeloid cells such as DCs and macrophages was induced in response to TLR agonists such as LPS. Twist-2 was previously shown to directly bind the p65 subunit of NF-&#x003ba;B and inhibit the transactivation and production of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF&#x003b1;, IL-1, and IL-6 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060316-b035">35</xref>&#x0005d;. In this study, we found that the production of Th1-polarizing cytokines such as IL-12 and IFN&#x003b3; was also critically regulated by Twist-2. This is in agreement with a recently study describing a role for Twist-1 in regulating Th1 cytokines in T-cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060316-b066">66</xref>&#x0005d;. We further demonstrated that the mechanism for the suppression of IL-12 production by Twist-2 involves inhibition of NF-&#x003ba;B activity, not via the direct binding of Twist-2 to E-boxes in the IL-12 promoter (unpublished data). It was previously reported that C/EBP&#x003b1; and NF-&#x003ba;B p50 or p65 directly interact and cooperate to activate proinflammatory genes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060316-b067">67</xref>&#x0005d;. Our finding of the inhibition of C/EBP&#x003b1; by Twist-2 raises an interesting possibility that the critical regulation of proinflammatory cytokines by Twist-2 may be a result of the inhibition of both NF-&#x003ba;B and C/EBP&#x003b1; proteins by Twist-2. Moreover, Twist-2 was found to have a critical role in maintaining endotoxin tolerance. Thus, Twist-2, in addition to its critical role in regulation of myeloid lineage differentiation and the proliferation of myeloid progenitors, uniquely regulates proinflammatory responses to prevent excessive inflammation by inhibiting proinflammatory cytokines and promoting anti-inflammatory cytokine production.</p><p>IL-10 is a potent anti-inflammatory cytokine and plays a critical role in maintaining homeostasis of the immune system and protecting the host from excessive inflammation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060316-b065">65</xref>&#x0005d;. Despite its biological importance, the regulation of IL-10 gene expression remains poorly defined. In this study, we found that Twist-2 promotes the expression of IL-10, not via direct activation of the IL-10 promoter, but possibly through the activation of c-Maf transcription. We demonstrated that Twist-2 is likely a transcriptional activator of c-Maf. bHLH transcription factors have been known to function as activators or repressors, depending on the partners or cofactors &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060316-b045">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060316-b048">48</xref>&#x0005d;. c-Maf is the cellular counterpart of oncogenic v-Maf in the acute transforming avian retrovirus AS42 that induces musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma (Maf) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060316-b068">68</xref>&#x0005d;. c-Maf is a member of the family of basic region&#x02013;leucine zipper domain transcription factors, and the target genes of c-Maf in various cell lineages include the insulin gene in islet &#x003b2; cells and IL-4 and IL-10 in T cells and myeloid cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060316-b049">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060316-b069">69</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060316-b070">70</xref>&#x0005d;.
