Mutations in <italic>ATRX</italic> provided the first example of a human genetic disease associated with defects in such proteins. To better understand the role of ATRX in development and the associated abnormalities in the ATR-X (alpha thalassemia mental retardation, X-linked) syndrome, we conditionally inactivated the homolog in mice, <italic>Atrx,</italic> at the 8- to 16-cell stage of development. The protein, Atrx, was ubiquitously expressed, and male embryos null for Atrx implanted and gastrulated normally but did not survive beyond 9.5 days postcoitus due to a defect in formation of the extraembryonic trophoblast, one of the first terminally differentiated lineages in the developing embryo. Carrier female mice that inherit a maternal null allele should be affected, since the paternal X chromosome is normally inactivated in extraembryonic tissues. Surprisingly, however, some carrier females established a normal placenta and appeared to escape the usual pattern of imprinted X-inactivation in these tissues. Together these findings demonstrate an unexpected, specific, and essential role for Atrx in the development of the murine trophoblast and present an example of escape from imprinted X chromosome inactivation.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="synopsis"><title>Synopsis</title><p>ATRX belongs to a class of proteins that may modify how DNA is packaged into chromatin, altering the accessibility of other proteins in the nucleus to DNA. In this way, ATRX is thought to influence gene expression. Mutations in the <italic>ATRX</italic> gene, which is located on the female sex chromosome (X), provided the first example of a human disease (ATR-X syndrome) associated with defects in such proteins. Affected males (X<sup>MUT</sup>Y) have multiple developmental abnormalities in a wide variety of systems. Currently, it is not understood how proteins like ATRX influence cell biology. To address this question, the authors deleted the version of the gene in mice, <italic>Atrx</italic>. Although affected male mice (X<sup>MUT</sup>Y) started to develop normally, they died early in development because they failed to form a normal placenta. In the placenta, female mice normally inactivate the X chromosome that they inherit from their fathers (Xp), so if females inherit from their mother an X chromosome (Xm) that bears the abnormal copy of <italic>Atrx</italic> (Xm<sup>MUT</sup>Xp), one would predict that, like affected males, they would fail to form a normal placenta. The authors unexpectedly found this not to be so. They showed, instead, that in such females the normal, paternally derived <italic>Atrx</italic> gene is active. This study has therefore demonstrated an important facet of X-chromosome imprinting.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>Citation:</meta-name><meta-value>Garrick D, Sharpe JA, Arkell R, Dobbie L, Smith AJH, et al.

It is usually associated with a mild form of &#x003b1;-thalassaemia, caused by reduced expression of structurally intact &#x003b1;-globin genes, and characterised by the presence of &#x003b2;-globin tetramers (haemoglobin H inclusion bodies) in peripheral red blood cells.

This gene encodes two dominant protein isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020058-g001">Figure 1</xref>). As well as the full-length ATRX protein of ~280 kDa, which is encoded by a transcript of ~10 kb, we recently demonstrated that a truncated isoform called ATRXt (~200 kDa) is produced from a transcript of around 7 kb, which arises when intron 11 fails to be spliced from the primary transcript and an alternative intronic poly(A) signal is used &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020058-b004">4</xref>&#x0005d;. The mouse homolog of the <italic>ATRX</italic> gene, <italic>Atrx,</italic> is also situated on the X chromosome, and also gives rise to full-length (Atrx, ~280 kDa) and truncated (Atrxt, ~200 kDa) isoforms &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020058-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020058-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Disease-causing missense mutations are clustered in two regions of the gene: a PHD-like zinc finger domain and a SNF2-like ATPase domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020058-g001">Figure 1</xref>) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020058-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d;. The former motif is thought to be involved in protein-protein interactions in chromatin &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020058-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d;, and the latter is a feature of chromatin-remodelling proteins, and the presence of disease-causing mutations indicates the functional importance of these domains. ATRX has been shown to remodel chromatin &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020058-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;. It also interacts with HP1 at heterochromatin &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020058-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d; and is recruited to promyelocytic leukemia nuclear bodies via an interaction with Daxx &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020058-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;. Furthermore, disruption of ATRX leads to diverse changes in DNA methylation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020058-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;. Nevertheless, the role ATRX plays in gene expression remains unclear.</p><p>The consistent core of clinical and haematological features observed in ATR-X patients suggests that, like the SWI2/SNF2 chromatin-remodelling protein, ATRX probably regulates transcription of a discrete set of target genes. However, although there are clearly others to be found, at present the &#x003b1;-globin genes remain the only confirmed targets for transcriptional regulation by ATRX. Little is currently known about the precise role of the ATRX protein during mammalian development. To investigate the role of this protein during mouse development, we generated a conditionally deleted allele of the <italic>Atrx</italic> gene in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells, and used these cells to examine the effect of ablating expression of the full-length Atrx protein in ES cells and in mouse embryos.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Generation of ES Cells Lacking Full-Length Atrx</title><p>Like the human gene, the mouse <italic>Atrx</italic> gene is also X-linked, such that a direct disruption of the single <italic>Atrx</italic> allele in male ES cells would immediately give rise to the null state. No targeted clones were recovered after attempted homologous recombination in male E14TG2a ES cells using two different vectors that removed exon 18 of the <italic>Atrx</italic> gene. Exon 18 encodes the first of the seven motifs composing the conserved SNF2-like domain of Atrx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020058-g001">Figure 1</xref>); mutation of the corresponding motif of the yeast SNF2 protein has been shown to severely impair SWI/SNF-dependent gene expression &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020058-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;. The failure to recover targeted clones with these vectors suggested that Atrx may be important for normal ES cell growth and expansion and that direct targeting of the single locus may not be possible. We therefore adopted a conditional strategy for targeting exon 18 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020058-g002">Figure 2</xref>) and recovered two clones in which exon 18 has been flanked by <italic>loxP</italic> recognition sites for the Cre recombinase (<italic>Atrx</italic><sup>flox</sup> allele in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020058-g002">Figure 2</xref>A) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020058-g002">Figure 2</xref>B).

As expected, the truncated Atrxt isoform, the transcript of which is terminated within intron 11 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020058-b004">4</xref>&#x0005d;, is unaffected by the deletion of exon 18 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020058-g002">Figure 2</xref>E). While the function of Atrxt is not yet clear, this isoform, which contains the PHD-like domain but not the SWI/SNF motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020058-g001">Figure 1</xref>), is unlikely to be functionally equivalent to the full-length protein. Thus, a conditional knockout strategy allowed the isolation of ES cells that are null for full-length Atrx.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Perturbed Growth and Methylation Defects in Atrx<sup>null</sup> ES Cells</title><p>Atrx<sup>null</sup> ES cells could be maintained in culture but were generally slower growing than Atrx<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> ES clones, and appeared to undergo higher rates of spontaneous differentiation. We investigated directly the effect of Atrx on ES cell growth by comparing Atrx<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and Atrx<sup>null</sup> ES cell clones in competition cultures. Equal numbers of Atrx<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> (bearing either an <italic>Atrx</italic><sup>WT</sup> or an <italic>Atrx</italic><sup>flox</sup> allele) and Atrx<sup>null</sup> (bearing an <italic>Atrx</italic><sup>&#x00394;18&#x00394;neo</sup> allele) ES cells were inoculated into cultures and the mixed cultures were passaged (1:3 split) every 2 d for 8&#x02013;10 d. The relative abundance of the different alleles in the culture at each time point was analysed by Southern blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020058-g003">Figure 3</xref>A). The clone containing the <italic>Atrx</italic><sup>&#x00394;18&#x00394;neo</sup> allele was rapidly outgrown by both <italic>Atrx</italic><sup>WT</sup> ES cells and cells bearing the <italic>Atrx</italic><sup>flox</sup> allele. In a control competition experiment between different clones bearing functional <italic>Atrx</italic> alleles (<italic>Atrx</italic><sup>WT</sup> and <italic>Atrx</italic><sup>flox</sup>), both clones continued to be equally represented after 8 d of cocultivation. Thus, although Atrx<sup>null</sup> ES cells could be recovered and maintained in culture by a conditional targeting approach, these cocultivation experiments suggested that the absence of Atrx does negatively impact upon normal ES cell growth.</p><p>To investigate a possible cell-cycle defect in the absence of Atrx, we analysed the cell cycle distribution of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU)-pulsed ES cells by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020058-sg001">Figure S1</xref>A). Surprisingly, both Atrx<sup>null</sup> ES cell clones exhibited a cell cycle profile that was indistinguishable from ES cells bearing a functional <italic>Atrx</italic> allele (<italic>Atrx</italic><sup>WT</sup> or <italic>Atrx</italic><sup>flox</sup>). We also specifically quantitated the mitotic index within each population by flow cytometry after staining ES cells for phosphorylated (Ser10) histone H3, a specific marker of mitosis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020058-sg001">Figure S1</xref>B) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020058-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;. Consistent with the normal cell-cycle profile observed above, there was no depletion in the size of the mitotic population in the Atrx<sup>null</sup> ES clones, despite their slow growth. Finally, we investigated whether the growth defect in the Atrx<sup>null</sup> ES cells was due to an up-regulation of apoptosis by staining cells with Annexin V (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020058-sg002">Figure S2</xref>) and found that the proportion of apoptotic cells was not significantly affected by the absence of full-length Atrx. Thus, the growth defect observed in ES cells lacking Atrx is not due to a specific cell cycle block or significant induction of cell death. While the cause of the proliferative delay is not yet clear, since Atrx<sup>null</sup> ES cells appear to undergo higher rates of spontaneous differentiation (unpublished data), it seems likely that the observed growth defect reflects the spontaneous transition from fast-cycling, undifferentiated ES cells into more slowly cycling, differentiated cell types in these cultures.</p><p>It has been shown that disease-causing mutations in the human <italic>ATRX</italic> gene give rise to changes in the normal pattern of DNA methylation at several repetitive sequences within the human genome &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020058-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;. Notably, the transcribed region of the ribosomal DNA (rDNA) repeat was found to be significantly hypomethylated in ATR-X patients relative to normal individuals. Using methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes, we also observed significant hypomethylation at several sites tested within the mouse rDNA repeats in Atrx<sup>null</sup> ES cells and 12-d embryoid bodies relative to ES cells and embryoid bodies bearing a functional <italic>Atrx</italic> allele (<italic>Atrx</italic><sup>WT</sup> or <italic>Atrx</italic><sup>flox</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020058-g003">Figure 3</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020058-g003">3</xref>C). The observation that rDNA is hypomethylated in the absence of Atrx, even in ES cells, is consistent with the finding that hypomethylation of the human rDNA repeats is detectable from an early developmental stage in ATR-X patients. Other mouse repetitive sequence elements surveyed in ES cell DNA include the heterochromatic major satellite (assayed with MaeII) and minor satellite (assayed with HpaII) repeats, as well as interspersed retroviral repeats of the intracisternal A particle (IAP) type and the Line 1 and Sine B1 families (all assayed with HpaII). These repeats were found to be moderately (Line 1 and Sine B1) or highly (IAP, major satellite, minor satellite) methylated in wild-type ES cells, and this methylation was not detectably perturbed by the absence of Atrx (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020058-sg003">Figure S3</xref> and unpublished data). Taken together, these data indicate that the subtle interplay between the ATRX protein and DNA methylation observed in human patients is also present in mouse cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Early Embryonic Lethality in Atrx<sup>null</sup> Male Mice</title><p>To investigate the role of the Atrx protein during mouse development, we initially established lines of mice bearing the <italic>Atrx</italic><sup>flox</sup> allele. Two independently targeted <italic>Atrx</italic><sup>flox</sup> ES cell clones with normal male karyotype were injected into C57BL/6 blastocysts to produce chimaeric mice, which were then used to obtain germline transmission. Intercrosses between males hemizygous (<italic>Atrx</italic><sup>flox</sup>/Y) and females heterozygous (<italic>Atrx</italic><sup>WT/flox</sup>) for the floxed allele were also carried out to generate homozygous females (<italic>Atrx</italic><sup>flox/flox</sup>). Males hemizygous and females heterozygous or homozygous for the <italic>Atrx</italic><sup>flox</sup> allele were viable, appeared healthy, and bred normally, suggesting that, as expected, the <italic>Atrx</italic><sup>flox</sup> allele was functionally normal. To generate Atrx<sup>null</sup> mice by Cre-mediated recombination, the <italic>Atrx</italic><sup>flox</sup> mice were crossed with mice harboring a transgene in which the Cre recombinase is expressed under the control of the regulatory elements of the mouse <italic>GATA-1</italic> gene <italic>(GATA1-cre)</italic> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020058-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d;.

This finding was unexpected, since human ATR-X patients clearly survive to adulthood (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Discussion</xref>). Embryos were dissected at 7.5, 8.5, and 9.5 dpc and genotyped by PCR analysis of DNA extracted from yolk sac or total embryo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020058-g004">Figure 4</xref>B and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020058-sd001">Protocol S1</xref>). Atrx<sup>null</sup> males were present at expected mendelian ratios (~25&#x00025;) at both 7.5 dpc and 8.5 dpc (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0020058-t001">Table 1</xref>). However, by 9.5 dpc, depletion was observed both in the number of Atrx<sup>null</sup> males (7&#x00025;) and in the total number of males recovered (31&#x00025;). No Atrx<sup>null</sup> males were recovered after 9.5 dpc. Thus the absence of Atrx gives rise to embryonic lethality in mice before 9.5 dpc.</p><p>To investigate the morphology of Atrx<sup>null</sup> embryos prior to death, embryos from the above crosses were initially dissected in their deciduas at 7.5 dpc, and paraffin sections were stained with haematoxylin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020058-g005">Figure 5</xref>A) or with an anti-ATRX antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020058-g005">Figure 5</xref>B&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020058-g005">5</xref>E). Immunohistochemical staining revealed that Atrx was widely expressed in wild-type 7.5 dpc embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020058-g005">Figure 5</xref>B). Expression was highest in the embryonic region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020058-g005">Figure 5</xref>C) and the chorion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020058-g005">Figure 5</xref>D). Detectable but lower levels of expression were observed in the ectoplacental cone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020058-g005">Figure 5</xref>D) and surrounding decidual tissue. We also observed very high levels of Atrx expression in trophoblast giant cells (TGCs) surrounding the Reichert's membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020058-g005">Figure 5</xref>E). Within the large nuclei of these TGCs, the typical nuclear association of Atrx with blocks of pericentromeric heterochromatin &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020058-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d; was clearly observable.

Morphologically, 7.5 dpc Atrx<sup>null</sup> embryos were dramatically reduced in size and appeared developmentally retarded relative to stage-matched wild-type embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020058-g005">Figure 5</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020058-g005">5</xref>B). However, despite their reduced size, the general morphology and organisation of embryonic structures in Atrx<sup>null</sup> conceptuses appeared grossly normal. The amnion and chorion were clearly present and the amniotic, exocoelomic, and ectoplacental cavities were distinguishable, as were all three embryonic germ layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020058-g005">Figure 5</xref>A&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020058-g005">5</xref>C).

Very few apoptotic cells were detected in wild-type 7.5 dpc embryos. In Atrx<sup>null</sup> embryos, a slight increase in the apoptotic population was evident. However, consistent with our observation of a grossly normal apoptotic index in Atrx<sup>null</sup> ES cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020058-sg002">Figure S2</xref>), the apoptotic response observed in Atrx<sup>null</sup> embryos was also not uniform, but was restricted to a low number of scattered TUNEL-positive cells. Since this small apoptotic response is unlikely to account fully for the dramatic size deficit observed in Atrx<sup>null</sup> embryos, a possible proliferation defect was also investigated by immunohistochemical staining of 7.5 dpc embryo sections for the mitosis marker phosphorylated (Ser10) histone H3 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020058-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;. Relative to the very high mitotic index observed in wild-type embryos, the proportion of mitotic cells observed in Atrx<sup>null</sup> embryos at 7.5 dpc was dramatically reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020058-g006">Figure 6</xref>B). Taken together, these results suggest that the size deficit observed in Atrx<sup>null</sup> embryos prior to lethality largely reflects a proliferative defect, with a minor but indirect contribution from increased apoptosis. Although a growth defect was also observed in Atrx<sup>null</sup> ES cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020058-g003">Figure 3</xref>A), in contrast to the Atrx<sup>null</sup> embryos, the mitotic index of the ES cell population (as measured with the same antibody) was not depleted (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020058-sg001">Figure S1</xref>B). These observations suggest that the mitotic defect observed in embryos is unlikely to be a direct, cell-autonomous effect of the absence of Atrx, and is more likely to be a secondary effect resulting from the failure to develop a normal trophoblast (see below).</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Trophectoderm Failure in Atrx<sup>null</sup> Embryos</title><p>Whole-mount observation of 8.5 dpc embryos revealed that, in contrast to the basically normal although delayed morphology of the embryo itself, the extraembryonic tissues of Atrx<sup>null</sup> conceptuses appeared highly disorganised.

This is consistent with the observation that Atrx<sup>null</sup> conceptuses implant successfully and survive to gastrulation. Taken together, these data suggest that loss of Atrx results in a defect in formation of the secondary trophoblast that is apparent from 7.5 dpc. Despite initiating normal organisation in the embryo proper, Atrx<sup>null</sup> conceptuses exhibit a proliferative defect by 7.5 dpc and die by around 9.5 dpc, probably due to a nutritional deficit resulting from failure to develop a normal trophoblast.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Escape from Imprinted Inactivation of the Paternally Inherited <italic>Atrx</italic><sup>WT</sup> Allele in Extraembryonic Tissues of Carrier Female Mice</title><p>Female mice carrying an <italic>Atrx</italic><sup>null</sup> allele (<italic>Atrx</italic><sup>WT/null</sup>;<italic>GATA1-cre</italic><sup>&#x0002b;<italic>/</italic>&#x02212;</sup>) were detected at 9.5 dpc (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0020058-t001">Table 1</xref>) and recovered at birth (unpublished data), although at both time points the number of carrier females was lower than that of wild-type (<italic>Atrx</italic><sup>WT/WT</sup>;<italic>GATA1-cre</italic><sup>&#x0002b;<italic>/</italic>&#x02212;</sup>) females, suggesting that a proportion of carrier female embryos died in utero.

Thus, in the extraembryonic compartment of <italic>Atrx</italic><sup>WT/null</sup> carrier females, normal imprinted X-inactivation would be expected to result in silencing of the paternally derived <italic>Atrx</italic><sup>WT</sup> allele, leaving only the <italic>Atrx</italic><sup>null</sup> allele on the active maternal X (Xm) and thereby render the extraembryonic tissues null for full-length Atrx protein. However, the absence of Atrx in the extraembryonic compartment is lethal in <italic>Atrx</italic><sup>null</sup>/Y males.

In these carrier females, the <italic>Atrx</italic><sup>WT</sup> allele is paternally inherited. Embryos were dissected in their deciduas at 7.5 dpc, and paraffin sections were stained with anti-ATRX antibody, along with sections from a wild-type 7.5 dpc embryo for comparison (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020058-g008">Figure 8</xref>). As described above, Atrx expression was detected in every cell in the epiblast (embryo proper) region of wild-type 7.5 dpc embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020058-g008">Figure 8</xref>B). In contrast, the epiblast region of carrier female embryos was composed of a mosaic of small clusters of Atrx-positive cells (in which the <italic>Atrx</italic><sup>null</sup> allele on Xm had been inactivated) and Atrx-negative cells (in which the <italic>Atrx</italic><sup>WT</sup> allele on Xp had been inactivated), indicating that the <italic>Atrx</italic> gene was subject to normal random X-inactivation in the epiblast. Remarkably, clear Atrx expression could also be detected in the extraembryonic tissues of carrier females, as shown in the extraembryonic-derived chorionic ectoderm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020058-g008">Figure 8</xref>C). Atrx expression could be detected in almost all cells of the chorionic ectoderm. Atrx expression was also clearly detected in other extraembryonic structures, including TGCs (unpublished data).

At present, the cause of the proliferative delay in Atrx<sup>null</sup> ES cells is not known. Interestingly, we demonstrated that apoptosis is not significantly up-regulated in ES cells lacking Atrx and is only mildly elevated in Atrx<sup>null</sup> 7.5 dpc mouse embryos.

Before death, Atrx<sup>null</sup> embryos exhibit a markedly reduced mitotic index, suggesting a proliferative defect. Although the embryonic compartment of the conceptus appears initially normal, by 7.5 dpc Atrx<sup>null</sup> embryos display abnormalities in development of the trophoblast, including a depletion in the population of TGCs surrounding the conceptus and a reduction in the size of the ectoplacental cone, which contains the diploid giant cell precursors &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020058-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;.

Since Atrx<sup>null</sup> embryos appear to implant normally, lethality is likely to arise due to a failure of TGC function later during development.</p><p>Embryonic lethality in mice in the absence of Atrx was a surprising finding, as there had been no suggestion of foetal loss in the human ATR-X syndrome. It is possible that the role of Atrx in the trophoblast is specific to mice and that ATRX has no role or is redundant in the human trophoblast. Indeed, the birth weight of babies with ATR-X syndrome is usually normal. An alternative explanation for the unexpectedly severe phenotype we observed in mice is that the <italic>Atrx</italic><sup>&#x00394;18&#x00394;neo</sup> deletion generated by Cre recombination completely ablates full-length Atrx protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020058-g002">Figure 2</xref>E). In contrast, all disease-causing mutations characterised in human ATR-X pedigrees appear to give rise to hypomorphic alleles. Some full-length ATRX protein is detected in cases predicted to have truncating mutations (RJG, unpublished data), and residual ATPase activity in ATRX immunoprecipitates can be detected in Epstein-Barr virus-transformed lymphocytes of all human patients analysed to date (A. Argentaro and M. Mitson, unpublished data). The failure to observe a truly null <italic>ATRX</italic> allele among human patients strongly suggests that, as in the mouse, the complete absence of ATRX protein is incompatible with human fetal survival.</p><p>While this study has revealed an unexpected role for Atrx in the murine trophectoderm, as a result of the early lethality observed in Atrx<sup>null</sup> embryos it is not possible to rule out other roles for Atrx at later developmental stages in tissues of the embryo proper. Indeed, we show that Atrx is highly expressed throughout the entire developing embryo at 7.5 dpc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020058-g005">Figure 5</xref>B), and it is likely that Atrx function will turn out to be important for other differentiating tissues. Tetraploid aggregation experiments (in which mutant embryos are rescued with wild-type extraembryonic tissues) might shed more light on the role of Atrx during later mouse development, but these issues can be more subtly dissected by combining the conditional <italic>Atrx</italic><sup>flox</sup> allele that we have generated with different tissue-specific Cre transgenes. As mentioned above, this approach has already revealed a critical role for Atrx during neuronal differentiation in adult mice &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020058-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d;. Further evidence that Atrx is also required at later stages of mouse development is provided by the observed dramatic skewing against Atrx-negative cells in some somatic tissues of carrier female mice, whose tissues initially comprise a mosaic of Atrx-positive and Atrx-negative cells as a result of random X-inactivation (M. Muers, personal communication).</p><p><italic>Atrx</italic> joins an expanding list of mouse genes for which targeted disruption results in peri-implantation lethality as a result of trophoblast or placental abnormalities (reviewed in &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020058-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d;). Comparison with other phenotypes might provide some insight into the role of Atrx in trophoblast development. <italic>Atrx</italic>-mutant embryos progress further than embryos nullizygous for factors involved in the initial specification of trophoblast stem cells (such as <italic>Cdx2</italic>) or in stem cell maintenance and proliferation (such as <italic>Eomes</italic>). <italic>Cdx2</italic>-mutant embryos fail to implant and die between 3.5 and 5.5 dpc &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020058-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d;, while <italic>Eomes</italic>-mutant blastocysts implant into the uterus, but arrest soon after implantation without forming organised embryonic or extraembryonic structures &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020058-b027">27</xref>&#x0005d;. In contrast, <italic>Atrx</italic>-mutant embryos implant successfully and establish organised embryonic structures by 7.5 dpc. The <italic>Atrx</italic>-mutant phenotype closely resembles that observed in mice nullizygous for the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor Hand1. <italic>Hand1</italic>-mutant conceptuses arrest at around 7.5 dpc and display a normal embryonic compartment, but, like <italic>Atrx</italic>-mutant embryos, ablation of Hand1 causes a reduction in the size of the ectoplacental cone and density of TGCs &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020058-b028">28</xref>&#x0005d;. As with <italic>Atrx</italic> mutants, only arrested or resorbed <italic>Hand1</italic>-mutant conceptuses were recovered after 8.5 dpc. Also like Atrx, disruption of Hand1 specifically affects secondary giant cell formation, and primary trophoblast outgrowths from blastocysts appeared normal. Hand1 is required for terminal differentiation of secondary TGCs, and in its absence trophoblast cells arrest at a precursor stage in the ectoplacental cone &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020058-b017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020058-b028">28</xref>&#x0005d;. Given the similarity of the <italic>Atrx</italic>- and <italic>Hand1</italic>-mutant phenotypes and the likelihood that Atrx acts as a transcriptional regulator by modifying chromatin structure, it will be of interest to determine whether Atrx is itself a regulator of <italic>Hand1</italic> expression, or alternatively whether it acts as a co-regulator of one or more of the downstream transcriptional targets of Hand1. It is noteworthy that, in the brain-specific <italic>Atrx</italic> knockout mice, the defect was observed in terminally differentiating neurons &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020058-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d;. The secondary TGCs affected in the universal <italic>Atrx</italic> knockout reported here represent one of the first terminally differentiated tissues in the developing mouse, and this may point to the requirement for Atrx in the high-level expression of some tissue-specific genes during the final stages of differentiation. Interestingly, the &#x003b1;-globin genes, the only confirmed transcriptional targets of regulation by human ATRX, are also highly expressed specifically during terminal differentiation within the erythroid lineage.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title><italic>Atrx</italic> Escapes Imprinted X-Inactivation in Extraembryonic Tissues of Carrier Female Mice</title><p>Another surprising finding of this study is that, in carrier female embryos, a paternally inherited <italic>Atrx</italic><sup>WT</sup> allele appears to escape the process of imprinted X-inactivation, which ordinarily silences the Xp chromosome in the extraembryonic compartment of female murine tissues &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020058-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;.

Thus, unlike <italic>Atrx,</italic> these genes and/or their effects on cell growth are unable to circumvent the processes that ultimately cause all cells in the extraembryonic tissues to express only the maternally derived X chromosome. How might expression of the paternal <italic>Atrx</italic><sup>WT</sup> allele be maintained in the extraembryonic tissues of the <italic>Atrx</italic> carrier females?</p><p>One possibility is that, like some other X-linked genes, silencing of the <italic>Atrx</italic> gene on Xp is incomplete, such that there is always a low-level, leaky output of Atrx from a normally inactivated Xp chromosome in extraembryonic tissues.

Although initially small and quickly diluted in normal embryos, the cellular subpopulation that inactivates the Xm chromosome could rapidly expand to replace the normally imprinted cells in extraembryonic lineages if the normal silencing of Xp compromises cell growth or differentiation.

Alternatively, in the absence of Atrx, the paternal allele may partially escape the normal process of silencing. In both of these cases, other genes on the paternal X chromosome must be inactivated and remain so, since blocking inactivation of the entire Xp chromosome causes embryonic lethality due to biallelic expression of X-linked genes in the trophoblast &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020058-b039">39</xref>&#x0005d;.</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>Summary</title><p>ATR-X syndrome is the first human genetic disease known to be caused by mutations in a chromatin remodelling factor. At present we do not know how ATRX influences gene expression or what effect it has on cell behaviour. Nevertheless, we have previously noted that none of the natural mutations causing ATR-X syndrome are nulls, which suggests that it plays a critical role in normal development. Results of conditional inactivation of Atrx in the developing mouse forebrain, based on the <italic>Atrx</italic><sup>flox</sup> allele described here, shows that Atrx exerts a major effect on terminally differentiating neurons. Conditional inactivation of Atrx in other tissues is underway. Here we have shown that animal-wide disruption of the <italic>Atrx</italic> gene causes a severe embryonic-lethal phenotype, revealing an essential role for Atrx in the formation of the murine trophoblast. In addition, Atrx appears to escape imprinted X-chromosome inactivation in the extraembryonic tissues of some carrier female mice.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Generation of ES cells bearing the <italic>Atrx</italic><sup>flox</sup> allele.</title><p>Briefly, the targeting vector (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020058-g002">Figure 2</xref>A) places a <italic>loxP</italic> site within intron 18 and a <italic>loxP</italic>-flanked MC1neopA selection cassette in intron 17 of the <italic>Atrx</italic> gene.

<italic>ATRX</italic> cDNA. The boxes represent the 36 exons. The introns are not to scale. The alternative splicing of exons 6 and 7 is indicated. Shown underneath are the two ATRX protein isoforms. Full-length ATRX (~280 kDa) is encoded by the largest open reading frame. The positions of the principal features (the PHD-like domain and the seven SWI/SNF-like motifs) are indicated.
