Here, we investigated NRIP regulation. We cloned a 413-bp fragment from the transcription initiation site of the NRIP gene that had strong promoter activity, was TATA-less and GC-rich, and, based on DNA sequences, contained one androgen response element (ARE) and three Sp1-binding sites (Sp1-1, Sp1-2, Sp1-3). Transient promoter luciferase assays, chromatin immunoprecipitation and small RNA interference analyses mapped ARE and Sp1-2-binding sites involved in NRIP promoter activation, implying that NRIP is a target gene for AR or Sp1. AR associates with the NRIP promoter through ARE and indirectly through Sp1-binding site via AR&#x02013;Sp1 complex formation. Thus both ARE and Sp1-binding site within the NRIP promoter can respond to androgen induction. More intriguingly, NRIP plays a feed-forward role enhancing AR-driven NRIP promoter activity via NRIP forming a complex with AR to protect AR protein from proteasome degradation. This is the first demonstration that NRIP is a novel AR-target gene and that NRIP expression feeds forward and activates its own expression through AR protein stability.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Classical type I steroid nuclear receptors include androgen receptors (AR), estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors (PR), glucocorticoid receptors (GR) and mineralocorticoid receptors (MR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3 B4">1&#x02013;4</xref>). These nuclear receptors function as ligand-inducible transcription factors and typically form ligand-induced homodimers, binding to inverted repeat DNA response elements and then recruit coregulators to promote the expression of target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3 B4">1&#x02013;4</xref>). Coregulators are broadly defined as proteins that play essential roles in the regulation of nuclear receptors. They either enhance transactivation (coactivators) or reduce transactivation (corepressors) of target genes via general transcription factors and chromatin remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Over the past decade, several coactivators have been cloned and characterized, ones that associate with steroid receptors and enhance their ability to transactivate target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Most of these factors enhance assembly of basal transcription factors into a stable pre-initiation complex, resulting in increased transcription initiation rates of RNA polymerase II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Previously, we found a novel gene and named it nuclear receptor interaction protein (NRIP) (GenBankTM accession numbers AY766164 and AAX09330). NRIP contains 860 amino acids and seven copies of WD40 domains, and its expression is restricted to the cell nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). NRIP enhances transcriptional activity of either AR or GR via ligand-dependent interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). We also found that NRIP expression can be induced in prostate cancer cells (LNCaP) treated with androgen. Therefore, whether gene expression of NRIP is induced by hormone is an interesting research question that was investigated in this study.</p><p>Regarding prostate cancer, AR plays an important role in male sexual differentiation and prostate cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is a 33 kDa glycoprotein which is elevated in sera from prostate cancer patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). We previously characterized that NRIP can enhance an AR-driven PSA promoter activity in LNCaP in a ligand-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). In this study, we extensively investigated the mechanism of regulation of the NRIP gene. Through this investigation, we demonstrate that NRIP represents a novel AR-targeted gene and plays a feed-forward role in enhancing the AR-driven NRIP promoter activity via stabilization of the AR protein. Furthermore, we illustrate that NRIP enhances AR-induced NRIP and PSA gene expression in prostate cancer cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cell culture and drug treatments</title><p>We maintained 293T cells in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM <sc>l</sc>-glutamine, 100 U/ml of streptomycin and 100 U/ml of penicillin (Invitrogen).

Human NRIP gene is located at chromosome 1q24 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). The full-length cDNA of NRIP is 3085 bp and contains 93 bp of 5&#x02032;-untranslated region by 5&#x02032;-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE)-PCR to determine the transcription start site that is designated as +1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). To further investigate the regulation of the NRIP gene, the 5&#x02032;-flanking region between &#x02013;2583 and +94 bp upstream from the first exon of the NRIP gene was amplified by PCR from human HeLa cell genomic DNA.

To examine this hypothesis, prostate cancer cells (LNCaP) were maintained in hormone-depleted medium using CDS serum and then treated with increasing amounts of DHT for 12 h. Total cellular RNAs were subjected to semi-quantitative RT-PCR with NRIP, PSA, AR and &#x003b2;-actin (as an internal control) primers. Since PSA is an AR-targeted gene and a sensitive marker of prostate cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>), it is included here as a positive control. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A, the expressions of NRIP mRNA in 1 nM DHT and 10 nM DHT are 2.01- and 3.12-fold increases compared to CDS-treated cells, respectively, and the expressions of PSA are 2.19- and 3.87-fold increases. It indicates the expression of NRIP and PSA increased in proportion to the amount of DHT (lanes 2 and 3). NRIP and PSA mRNA were also significantly increased in LNCaP cells cultured in medium with fetal bovine serum (FBS, lane 4) due to a small amount of steroid hormone in the serum compared to CDS. These results indicate that NRIP, like PSA, is an androgen-induced gene. Furthermore, compared with the amount of NRIP mRNA in DHT-treated AR-deficient 293T cells, the NRIP mRNA expression level was elevated when the AR expression plasmid was introduced into cells using DHT treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B, lane 2). A consistent finding was that the NRIP promoter luciferase activity was increased 3- to 4-fold when 293T cells were transiently cotransfected with NRIP-P413 reporter constructs and AR expression plasmid in the presence of DHT (compared to without AR and DHT; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C). There was no promoter activity following treatment with DHT alone in 293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C).

Since the distance between ARE and Sp1-2-binding sites is less than 200 bp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C), the size of sonicated fragments from chromatin was between 200 and 500 bp under our conditions (data not shown) which hardly distinguishes which transcription factors can bind to each specific DNA-binding site. To verify it, we conducted ChIP assays for AR and Sp1 where the NRIP promoter was ectopically expressed in 293T cells. We constructed several mutant NRIP promoters including NRIP-P413/mARE with a mutated ARE, NRIP-P413/mSp1-2 with mutant at the Sp1-2 site, and NRIP-P413/mSp1-2/mARE containing both the mutated ARE and the mutated Sp1-2. After introducing the indicated promoter with AR- (pcDNA3.0-AR) and Sp1- (pSG5-HA-hSp1) expressing plasmids into 293T cells in the presence of DHT respectively, ChIP analysis was performed and the chromatin extracts from the DHT-treated cells were incubated with anti-AR antibody or anti-Sp1 antibody or without antibodies as a control.

As expected, it previously reported that androgens increase the steady-state expression of AR protein in LNCaP cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). This finding of NRIP-stabilizing AR protein is consistent with the result shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B by comparing lane 1 with lane 3. This suggests that AR is subject to proteasome-dependent degradation under normal physiological conditions and that NRIP can stabilize the AR protein. To further confirm a role for NRIP in the stabilization of the AR protein, 293T cells were transiently transfected with the AR expression plasmid and increasing amounts of NRIP expression plasmids. Western blotting analysis showed increasing amounts of AR protein were proportional to NRIP protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>D), Similarly, as shown in the Input panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C, the amount of AR protein was higher in the presence of GFP-NRIP than the absence (lanes 3 and 2). Taken together, it concludes that NRIP can stabilize the AR protein in a dose-dependent manner.</p><p>Because androgen stimulation can induce AR nuclear translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>), we were interested in investigating whether knockdown of NRIP would affect the nuclear translocation of AR in the presence of DHT. The fractionation of cytoplasmic and nuclear lysates from LNCaP cells infected with LV-shNRIP or LV-shLuc was done. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>E showed that AR protein amount was decreased in the shNRIP-treated cells both in the fraction of cytosol and nucleus, but no significant difference in the ratio of nuclear to cytosolic proteins between shLuc- and shNRIP-treated LNCaP cells. This indicates that NRIP has no effect on AR nuclear translocation. Taken together, our findings suggest that NRIP stabilizes AR protein but has no effect on AR mRNA and AR nuclear translocation.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In this study, we successfully isolated the NRIP promoter, and defined its location and sequence. The core promoter (NRIP-P413) ranged from &#x02013;413 to 94 bp, from its first exon, which contributes greatly to promoter activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). Through this investigation, AR and Sp1 were primarily found to influence NRIP gene transcription and the functional AR site at the ARE as well as Sp1 at the Sp1-2 sites within the NRIP core promoter. Our results indicate that NRIP, like PSA, is one of the downstream targets of the AR. Androgen, the natural ligand that activates AR, is essential for the physiological maintenance of the integrity of prostatic epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). Androgen-regulated genes such as PSA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>), p21 (WAF1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>), KLK-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>) have been well characterized, and androgen response elements (AREs) in these genes were identified. AR-target genes are topics that are currently of great interest due to the fact that AR appears to mediate the survival of prostate cancer patients and even of patients with other cancers. Recently, several AR-response genes were found and their functions characterized. For example, fibroblast growth factor 8 (FGF8) is known to induce cell proliferation in human prostate cancer and its presence correlates with tumor stage and pathological grade. FGF8 is induced by AR through ARE in the region of the FGF8 promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). Paternally expressed gene 10 (PEG10) is another gene that is AR-induced through ARE region of the PEG10 gene promoter and upregulated in hepatocellular carcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). Here we found a novel androgen-regulated gene-NRIP. The correlation of NRIP in prostate cancer development will be interesting for future investigation.</p><p>The DNA sequence of the NRIP promoter is TATA-less and GC-rich (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C). Sp1 is a ubiquitous transcription factor and reportedly binds to GC-rich DNA sequences (GGGCGG) in the proximal promoter regions of a wide variety of genes, especially TATA-less promoters, genes which are involved in a wide range of cellular processes including (a) cell cycle regulation, (b) maintenance of gene activation during embryonic development (by preventing <italic>de novo</italic> methylation of the CpG islands at house-keeping gene promoters) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>) and (c) preservation of chromatin structures at gene loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). Here we demonstrated that Sp1 stimulates NRIP gene expression at the Sp1-2-binding sequence of the NRIP core promoter. Mutation at the Sp1-2 site caused a reduction in NRIP promoter activity and chromatin immunoprecipitation. Therefore, Sp1 may function as a tethering moiety to recruit the general transcription machinery to a TATA-less NRIP promoter. Previously, Sp1 was reported directly binding to the proximal promoter region of PSA and stimulate the PSA gene expression, implying that Sp1 plays a role in prostate cancer through the regulation of the PSA gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Similarly, here we show that Sp1 also regulates NRIP gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>) and NRIP was a transcriptional cofactor to enhance AR-mediated PSA gene expression in our previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>), indicating that like PSA, NRIP can be a clinical marker of prostate cancer.</p><p>Ligand-bound steroid hormone receptors are classically thought to regulate gene expression by binding to the consensus hormone response elements in target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). Intriguingly, when mutation of the ARE did not completely abolish NRIP promoter responsiveness to androgen [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>D(b)], the induction of NRIP gene expression by androgen was mediated not only by an ARE within the NRIP proximal promoter, but also by one Sp1-binding site upon loss of the ARE site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B). Similarly, previous studies have shown that androgen activates expression of p21 (WAF1), mouse vas deferens protein (MVDP) and thyroid hormone receptor genes, which contain hormone response elements and Sp1 elements in their promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). Other than the hormone response element, Sp1 sites in these promoters can respond to hormone action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). Recently, several studies have also shown that some steroid hormone target genes do not contain the complete hormone response elements within their promoters and can be induced via Sp1 sites by steroid hormone receptor and transcription factor Sp1 interaction. For instance, cathepsin D and heat shock protein 27 (Hsp27) are two estrogen receptor (ER)-target genes and their promoters do not contain consensus estrogen response elements, but have ERE half-sites and GC-rich sequences in their promoters. The ER&#x02013;Sp1 complex was reported to be necessary for regulation of such promoter activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). Moreover, cross-talk between nuclear hormone receptors and many other transcription factors has been demonstrated in various studies such as AP1, nuclear factor-kB/Rel, Stat and C/EBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). Our results further support the notion that hormones induce some of their target genes via the Sp1 site when hormone response elements are absent in these target gene promoters. In sum, we demonstrate that ARE as only half-sites of actual AR-binding sequences and Sp1-2 among three predicted Sp1-binding sites in NRIP core promoter can respond androgen induction. We think that no more additional sequences in NRIP core promoter can be induced by androgen, since the double mutant promoter NRIP-P413/mSp1-2/mARE containing these two mutated sites completely abolishes both AR association (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B) and luciferase activity (data not shown).</p><p>Our study also demonstrates that AR and Sp1 not only bind to their respective consensus sites within the NRIP promoter, but also, the AR&#x02013;Sp1 complex activates NRIP transcription. This is similar to several reports of promoter regulation by AR and Sp1 such as regulation of p21, TRa and SRY genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). Using protein&#x02013;protein immunoprecipitation assays, we showed complex formation between AR and NRIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>) as well as between AR and Sp1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C), but not between Sp1 and NRIP. Therefore, positive regulation of NRIP on AR-target genes at Sp1-binding sequences involves indirect interaction NRIP with Sp1 via AR. On the basis of our results, we propose a functional model of NRIP in which NRIP feeds forward to activate its own promoter activity. This can occur through three possible mechanisms: (i) NRIP protein complexes AR which directly binds to an ARE site; (ii) NRIP forms a complex with the AR-Sp1 protein through the Sp1 protein which binds to the Sp1 site of the NRIP promoter; (iii) The ternary complex bridged through AR and Sp1 tethers to the ARE and Sp1-binding site, resulting in a loop formation on the NRIP promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A). Formation of this complex in response to androgen may facilitate binding of other coactivators and general transcription factors to form a preinitiation complex for gene transcription. The consequence of this effect would be to enhance expression of the androgen target genes NRIP and PSA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B). <fig id="F7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Three proposed models of NRIP gene regulation by AR and Sp1.

(<bold>B</bold>) NRIP feed-forward regulation activates its own expression and enhances AR-mediated PSA gene expression.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkm942f7"/></fig></p><p>We showed autoregulatory mechanisms of the NRIP gene, because NRIP can cause AR protein stabilization by avoiding proteasome degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). Along with our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>), this study shows that NRIP functions as a transcription cofactor to enhance AR-mediated gene expression, which results in the stimulation of NRIP and PSA promoter activity driven by AR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). The AR plays a central role in regulating the expression of genes involved in androgen-dependent and androgen-independent tumor formation. Regulation of AR-mediated transcription is achieved by AR protein stabilization and the acetylation status of androgen-responsive genes and/or the AR itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Factors that control AR stability have been confirmed by the finding that the AR is a direct target for Mdm2-mediated ubiquitylation and proteolysis. The E3 ligase activity of Mdm2 and phosphorylation of Mdm2 by PI3K/Akt are essential for Mdm2 to cause AR ubiquitylation and degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). As to how PI3K/AKT affects the AR protein, there are several possibilities. For instance, it was reported that the PI3K/Akt pathway can suppress AR activity in androgen-dependent LNCaP cells with low passage numbers, but enhances AR activity in LNCaP cells with high passage numbers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). In addition, recent report also demonstrated that PI3K/AKT activation via growth factor (HB-EGF) decreases AR protein levels by regulation of AR mRNA translation rates via mTOR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>). Our study found that NRIP is a cofactor of AR that increases AR transcription activity by stabilizing the AR protein. Further investigations should show what kind of signals is transduced by NRIP effects on the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway of AR, which may aid in the development of drug targets for the treatment of prostate cancer.</p><p>NRIP is a transcription cofactor of AR. Most co-activators and co-repressors share a capacity to influence the transcriptional potential of AR by regulating the acetylation&#x02013;deacetylation status of androgen responsive genes (such as NRIP, PSA) and/or the AR itself, via histone acetyltransferase (HAT) or histone deacetylase (HDAC) activities (chromatin modifying enzymes) that in turn alter the access of AR and general transcription factors to target gene promoters. The co-activators Tip60 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>), p300 and P/CAF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>) enhance the inherent transcriptional activity of the AR by direct receptor acetylation and upregulate transcriptional rates by histone acetylation of AR target genes. Conversely, reversal of HAT activity is important in the deacetylase-dependent abrogation of AR function by histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>). The further investigation of NRIP complex involving in acetlylation status of AR, may aid in understanding the mechanisms of NRIP role in prostate cancer development.</p><p>In sum, NRIP represents a novel AR-targeted gene, prompting an exploration of the correlation between PSA and NRIP, since both are AR-controlled genes. More intriguingly, we demonstrate that NRIP plays a feed-forward role in enhancing the AR-driven NRIP promoter activity via stabilization of the AR protein. Furthermore, we demonstrate that NRIP enhances AR-induced NRIP and PSA gene expression in prostate cancer cells.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We are indebted to Ms Shu-Chun Lin for technical assistance and thank Dr Zee-Fen Chang, Dr Ming-Shyue Lee, Dr Lih-Hwa Hwang and Dr Shiou-Hwei Yeh for their critical discussion.
