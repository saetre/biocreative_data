At low level of TPA treatments, EBV lytic gene expression was induced as indicated by the expression of EA-D as well as EBV-Z. However, at higher levels of TPA treatment, EBV lytic gene expression was turned down. Coincidently, the KSHV lytic gene expression was initiated as indicated by the expression of K-RTA and K-8. Thus, TPA could induce either EBV or KSHV lytic gene expression in BC cells depending on the dosages. More importantly, the KSHV lytic gene expression apparently correlated with dampened EBV lytic gene expression. EBV-Z was induced in a dose dependent manner.

The induction processes of lytic replications are apparently heterogeneous and depend on the cell, virus, and inducing agent. The co-existance of both EBV and KSHV in majority of PELs is providing a unique opportunity to study the interaction between the two viruses and the potential role in the pathogenesis. The two viruses are apparently able to interact with each other as well as the host <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001569-Fan1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001569-Xu1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>, and the presence of both viruses is more potent to promote tumor formation in rodent model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001569-Trivedi1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In this report, we have provided evidence that the critical lytic replication initiators of KSHV and EBV interact at molecular levels. First, K-RTA and EBV-Z are co-localized, and the two proteins physically interact with each other in the same PEL cells in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001569-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). Second, K-RTA inhibits the chemically-induced EBV lytic gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001569-g001">Fig. 1</xref>), and the inhibition may be related to the fact that K-RTA inhibits EBV-Z mediated lytic replication process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001569-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). EBV-Z and R-RTA physically interact and synergistically activate EBV lytic gene expression. This synergistic activation of EBV lytic gene expression is also inhibited by K-RTA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001569-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>), which clear shows the functional difference between K-RTA and E-RTA. Third, EBV-Z has the similar effect on KSHV: EBV-Z inhibits the chemically-induced KSHV lytic gene expression processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001569-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>), and the inhibition is likely due to that EBV-Z inhibits K-RTA-mediated transactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001569-g005">Fig. 5B&#x02013;5H</xref>). Fourth, the physical interaction between K-RTA and EBV-Z is apparently required for the mutual inhibition of the two molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001569-g004">Figs. 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001569-g005">5</xref>). The leucine heptapeptide repeat region in K-RTA and leucine zipper region in EBV-Z molecules are involved in the physical interactions between the two molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001569-g004">Figs. 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001569-g005">5</xref>). Fifth, we have shown that initiation of KSHV lytic gene expression correlated with the reduction of EBV lytic gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001569-g006">Fig. 6</xref>). All these data suggest that K-RTA and EBV-Z are physically interact and mutually inhibits each others' functions. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that K-RTA and EBV-Z proteins are interacting indirectly through other proteins, and we are investigating the subject currently. Finally, dually infected cells can express both K-RTA and EBV-Z in the same cells under the special induction conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001569-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). Of note under routine induction conditions such as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001569-g006">Figure 6</xref>, immunostaining of EBV-Z and K-RTA showed that the majority of cells were either K-RTA or EBV-Z positive, and only a small fraction were positive for both (data not shown). All these data collectively indicate that the physical interaction between the two proteins is relevant to the control of lytic gene expression in dually infected cells.</p><p>The mechanism of the mutual inhibition is not completely clear yet. However because both K-RTA and EBV-Z require multimerization for their proper functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001569-Bu1">&#x0005b;75&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001569-Sinclair1">&#x0005b;79&#x0005d;</xref>, we suspect that the physical interactions between the two may affect their respective multimerization process and thus inhibit each others' function.</p><p>There is an interesting phenomenon referred as selective switch from latency to lytic replication in dually infected cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001569-Sun2">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001569-Miller1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>. The mechanisms behind the selective induction of lytic replication is unknown, but the phenomenon clearly suggests that viral factor(s) is involved in this selective induction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001569-Miller1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>. Based on the facts that K-RTA and EBV-Z are the critical lytic replication initiators for KSHV and EBV latencies respectively, and our data that K-RTA and EBV-Z mutually inhibit each other's transactivations, we hypothesize that various chemical treatments and/or physiological stimuli may trigger differential expression of K-RTA or EBV-Z. The induced K-RTA and EBV-Z would neutralize each others' function through physical interactions. The predominantly-expressed gene product would block the function of another less-expressed one in dually infected cells. This process would result in only one critical lytic replication initiator remains functional in dually-infected PELs. The predominantly expressed molecule, either K-RTA or EBV-Z, would lead to the selective lytic replication of one virus in dually-infected PELs. The selective induction of lytic replication may facilitate the survival of the winning virus by maximally utilizing cellular resources.</p><p>However, KSHV is apparently has an advantage over EBV on the selective lytic replication processes. First, that the initiation of KSHV lytic gene expression correlated with the reduction of EBV lytic gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001569-g006">Fig. 6</xref>) suggests that the presence of KSHV lytic genes is overriding the EBV lytic gene expressions at least in BC1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001569-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>). Second, TPA has been shown to induce lytic replication of EBV in BC1 cells. We have found that TPA induces delayed expression of K-RTA, comparing to butyrate or TPA plus butyrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001569-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>). The delayed induction of K-RTA may provide an opportunity for lytic replication of EBV in BC1 cells. In addition, the faster induction of K-RTA by TPA plus butyrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001569-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>) provides an explanation that TPA and butyrate together induce KSHV, rather than EBV, lytic replication in BC1 cells. Third and finally, the induction of expression of the EBV-Z and E-RTA needs de novo protein synthesis while the induction of K-RTA of KSHV is not <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001569-Ye1">&#x0005b;80&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore with all available data, KSHV is apparently having an advantage over EBV for the induction of lytic replication in dually infected PELs.</p><p>It is of note that the mutual inhibition of K-RTA and EBV-Z may be used by both viruses to maintain and/or establish dual latency in PELs. The dually infected cells are apparently more latent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001569-Miller1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>. The mutual inhibition of the two lytic initiators may block some spontaneous lytic replications. In addition, the during primary infection processes to establish the dual latency, both KSHV and EBV lytic gene expressions are likely to be initiated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001569-Xu1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>. The mutual inhibition of K-RTA and EBV-Z might play a role for the establishment of dual latency in the same cells in primary infection.</p><p>Our previous data suggest that EBV inhibits the lytic replication of both KSHV and EBV through another mechanism involved with EBV latent membrane protein 1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001569-Xu1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>. The general consequences of EBV-Z or LMP-1-mediated inhibition of KSHV lytic replication are different: LMP-1 inhibits both EBV and KSHV lytic replications, while EBV-Z only inhibits KSHV lytic replication, but initiates EBV lytic replication. The comparative studies of EBV-Z and LMP-1 for their inhibitory effects on KSHV lytic replication have not been carried out extensively. However, the new mechanism identified in this report may reinforce the point that two viruses would prefer to maintain respective latency in a dually infected cells. One explanation would be that the lytic replication of the viruses may lead to the eventual death of the host cells. Therefore, both viruses may use their interactions to block potential lytic replication inductions.</p><p>In summary, we have addressed how the two viruses interact with each other in dually infected PELs. Our data may provided a possible mechanism for maintaining viral latency and for selective lytic replication in dually infected PELs, <italic>i.e</italic>., through mutual inhibition of two critical lytic replication initiators. Of note, the majority of the current studies on lytic replications of KSHV and EBV are using KSHV or EBV single-infected cells as model systems. Therefore, there is a concern about the applicability of these studies in dually-infected PELs. Our data about putative interactions between EBV and KSHV would be applicable to the majority of AIDS-associated PELs and may be relevant to the pathogenesis of PELs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Plasmids and antibodies</title><p>K-RTA, EBV-Z and E-RTA expression plasmids, K14A-luc and Pan-luc were described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001569-Zhang1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001569-Xu1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>.
