Overexpression promotes tumour-cell invasion and motility, growth in nude mice and tumour metastasis. It is feasible that L1-dependent signalling contributes to these effects. However, little is known about its mechanism in tumour cells. We reported previously that L1 is cleaved by ADAM (<underline>a</underline><underline>d</underline>isintegrin <underline>a</underline>nd <underline>m</underline>etalloprotease) and that the cytoplasmic part is essential for L1 function. Here we analysed more closely the role of proteolytic cleavage in L1-mediated nuclear signalling. Using OVMz carcinoma cells and L1-transfected cells as a model, we found that ADAM10-mediated cleavage of L1 proceeds in lipid raft and non-raft domains. The cleavage product, L1-32, is further processed by PS (presenilin)/&#x003b3;-secretase to release L1-ICD, an L1 intracellular domain of 28&#x000a0;kDa. Overexpression of dominant-negative PS1 or use of a specific &#x003b3;-secretase inhibitor leads to an accumulation of L1-32. Fluorescence and biochemical analysis revealed a nuclear localization for L1-ICD. Moreover, inhibition of ADAM10 and/or &#x003b3;-secretase blocks nuclear translocation of L1-ICD and L1-dependent gene regulation. Overexpression of recombinant L1-ICD mediates gene regulation in a similar manner to full-length L1. Our results establish for the first time that regulated proteolytic processing by ADAM10 and PS/&#x003b3;-secretase is essential for the nuclear signalling of L1 in human carcinoma cell lines.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="kwd"><kwd>a disintegrin and metalloprotease 10 (ADAM10)</kwd><kwd>L1 cell-adhesion molecule (L1-CAM)</kwd><kwd>nuclear translocation</kwd><kwd>presenilin (PS)/&#x003b3;-secretase activity</kwd><kwd>raft</kwd><kwd>signalling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="abbr"><kwd>ADAM, <underline>a d</underline>isintegrin <underline>a</underline>nd <underline>m</underline>etalloprotease</kwd><kwd>APP, amyloid precursor protein</kwd><kwd>CHO, Chinese-hamster ovary</kwd><kwd>CRABPII, cellular retinoic acid-binding protein II</kwd><kwd>CTF, C-terminal fragment</kwd><kwd>DAPT, <italic>N</italic>-[<italic>N</italic>-(3,5-difluorophenacetyl)-<sc>L</sc>-alanyl]-(<italic>S</italic>)-phenylglycine t-butyl ester (also known as presenilin inhibitor IX)</kwd><kwd>DRM, detergent-resistant membrane</kwd><kwd>ECL&#x000ae;, enhanced chemiluminescence</kwd><kwd>ERK, extracellular-signal-regulated kinase</kwd><kwd>FCS, fetal-calf serum</kwd><kwd>FNIII, fibronectin III</kwd><kwd>HEK-293, human embryonic kidney-293</kwd><kwd>hL1, human L1</kwd><kwd>HRP, horseradish peroxidase</kwd><kwd>ICD, intracellular domain</kwd><kwd>LAMP-1, lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1</kwd><kwd>L1, L1 cell-adhesion molecule</kwd><kwd>L1cyt, the cytoplasmic part of L1</kwd><kwd>mAb, monoclonal antibody</kwd><kwd>MDK, midkine or neurite growth-promoting factor 2</kwd><kwd>MT1-MMP, membrane type-1 matrix metalloproteinase</kwd><kwd>pAb, polyclonal antibody</kwd><kwd>PS(1), presenilin(-1)</kwd><kwd>qRT-PCR, quantitative real-time PCR</kwd><kwd>RIP, regulated intramembrane proteolysis</kwd><kwd>siRNA, small interfering RNA</kwd><kwd>TACE, tumour-necrosis factor-&#x003b1; converting enzyme</kwd><kwd>TAPI-0, <italic>N</italic>-(<italic>R</italic>)-[2-(hydroxyaminocarbonyl)methyl]-4-methylpentanoyl-<sc>L</sc>-naphthylalanyl-<sc>L</sc>-alanine amide</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="8"/><ref-count count="54"/><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>L1-CAM (L1 cell-adhesion molecule), or more simply L1, is a 200&#x02013;220-kDa transmembrane glycoprotein of the immunoglobulin superfamily. Initially, it was found to be involved in the regulation of cell migration, axon outgrowth and guidance during the development of the nervous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. However, more recent studies have shown that L1 also plays a role in the ontogeny of human tumours and its expression is linked to poor prognosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The mechanism by which L1 contributes to tumour progression is not clearly established.</p><p>Previous studies have demonstrated that L1 enhances growth of tumour cells in NOD/SCID (non-obese diabetic severe combined immunodeficiency) mice, augments tumour cell motility on extracellular-matrix proteins and invasiveness in matrigel assays, and promotes formation of liver metastases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Interference with L1 expression by genetic manipulation was found to be growth inhibitory <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Similar results were reported for L1 antibodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Importantly, a number of studies have demonstrated that L1 can alter gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Although ERK (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase) activation appears to be required for this process, it is unclear if additional factors are involved.</p><p>We demonstrated previously that the ectodomain of L1 is cleaved at the plasma membrane by ADAM10 (<underline>A</underline><underline>D</underline>isintegrin <underline>A</underline>nd <underline>M</underline>etalloprotease 10) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The involvement of ADAM10 was confirmed in a study using ADAM-deficient fibroblastic cell lines established from knock-out mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. This investigation suggested that ectodomain cleavage by ADAM10 is followed by intramembrane PS (presenilin)/&#x003b3;-secretase-dependent cleavage, leading to the generation of L1-ICD (L1 intracellular domain) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The process of RIP (regulated intramembrane proteolysis) is an essential step in a variety of signalling pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Nuclear translocation and transcriptional regulation of proteins such as Notch, CD44 and APP (amyloid precursor protein) were shown to depend on ADAM-mediated cleavage followed by PS/&#x003b3;-secretase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. We thus hypothesized that proteolytic processing might contribute to L1-signalling.</p><p>Lipid rafts are microdomains within the plasma membrane that are enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. They have gained attention as platforms for the proteolytic processing of several proteins, including APP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] and the cellular prion protein (PrP<sup>c</sup>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Interestingly, it has already been shown that members of the L1 family are associated with cholesterol-enriched microdomains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>In the present study we have analysed more closely the role of proteolytic processing for L1 signalling. We observed in OVMz cells that ADAM10-mediated cleavage of L1 proceeds in both lipid rafts and in non-raft domains. In addition, we provide evidence that PS/&#x003b3;-secretase activity is involved in further processing of the metalloprotease cleavage fragment. Pharmacological inhibition of ADAMs or &#x003b3;-secretase activity blocked nuclear translocation of L1 and abrogated L1-dependent gene regulation. Moreover, specific targeting of ADAM10 and PS1 with siRNA (small interfering RNA) affected transcription of L1-dependent genes. We also demonstrate that overexpression of recombinant L1-ICD mediates gene regulation similarly to full-length L1. Our results establish, to our knowledge for the first time, that proteolytic processing by ADAMs and PS/&#x003b3;-secretase is essential for nuclear signalling of L1 in cancer cell lines.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL</title><sec><title>Cells and DNAs</title><p>The ovarian carcinoma cell line OVMz and the stably transfected cell lines HEK-293-hL1 (human embryonic kidney-293-human L1) and CHO-hL1 (Chinese-hamster ovary-hL1) have been described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].

L1 undergoes regulated proteolysis at the cell surface and in released exosomes, a process that involves the metalloprotease ADAM10 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].

In addition, ADAM10 is expressed in ovarian and uterine carcinomas in which soluble L1 is detectable in the serum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p><p>Little is known about the fate of the L1-32 that remains after membrane proximal cleavage. Numerous studies have shown that residual transmembrane remnants become susceptible to RIP. Many substrates for PS-dependent &#x003b3;-secretase have already been identified, such as APP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], Notch [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], ErbB4 (v-erb-a erythroblastic leukaemia viral oncogene homologue) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], E-cadherin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] and CD44 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. They all undergo ectodomain shedding, which is evidently a prerequisite for subsequent &#x003b3;-secretase cleavage. Likewise, recent studies in mouse fibroblastic cell lines demonstrated that L1 is further processed by the PS&#x02013;&#x003b3;-secretase complex after initial cleavage by ADAM10 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>Here we provide evidence that regulated intramembrane proteolysis of L1 is also apparent in ovarian carcinoma cells. The decrease in PS/&#x003b3;-secretase activity brought about by the specific inhibitor DAPT or the overexpression of dominant-negative PS1 (D385N) led to the accumulation of L1-32 without a concomitant increase in the L1 ectodomain. Moreover, we observed in an <italic>in vitro</italic> assay that the conversion of the initial ADAM10 cleavage fragment L1-32 into a soluble form of approx. 28&#x000a0;kDa is sensitive to the &#x003b3;-secretase inhibitor DAPT. In contrast with the findings by Maretzky et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], we were not able to detect L1-28 in cell lysates, even when cells were grown in the presence of proteasome inhibitors (results not shown). This might be due to low abundance and/or rapid degradation of the L1 intracellular domain in carcinoma cells. However we identified an L1 cleavage product after enrichment of purified nuclei. The size of this fragment was similar to that of the soluble L1-form released in the <italic>in vitro</italic> assay described.</p><p>We further analysed the role of proteolytic processing in L1-dependent signalling. Confocal microscopy confirmed that L1-ICD can localize to the nuclei of CHO-hL1 cells. Nuclear translocation was clearly diminished in cells treated with TAPI-0 and DAPT, inhibitors of metalloproteases and &#x003b3;-secretase respectively. These findings suggested that L1 enters the nucleus after initial ADAM10 cleavage, followed by RIP. We assumed that L1-ICD in the nucleus might participate in transcriptional regulation by analogy to what has already been described for Notch [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. To address this question, we investigated the impact of blocking proteolytic processing on L1-dependent gene regulation. We have recently identified a number of genes that are regulated by L1 in HEK-293 cells, such as those coding for cathepsin B, &#x003b2;3 integrin, CRABPII or HOXA9 (homeobox A9) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. As demonstrated here for cathepsin B and CRABPII, L1-mediated gene regulation was blocked in the presence of specific ADAM and PS/&#x003b3;-secretase inhibitors. Moreover, specific targeting of ADAM10 or PS1 with siRNA affected the transcription of genes, e.g. those encoding MDK and &#x003b2;3 integrin, similar to knock-down of L1 in ovarian carcinoma cells. Taken together, these results highlight the relevance of consecutive processing for the downstream signalling of L1.</p><p>To corroborate the role of the L1-ICD in transcriptional regulation, we expressed an artificial L1-ICD lacking the ectodomain and transmembrane region (L1cyt). Indeed, we found that L1cyt localized to the nucleus and mediated transcriptional regulation similarly to full-length L1. Additional analysis has shown that L1cyt does not support cell proliferation <italic>in vitro</italic> and tumour growth in mice as does full-length L1 (H. Kiefel, unpublished work). These results are in agreement with recent observations by Gavert et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Nevertheless, our findings underline the role of the cytoplasmic part of L1 for signalling and establish a link between proteolysis, nuclear translocation and L1-mediated transcriptional regulation. It is currently not clear how L1 signal transduction by RIP relates to the L1-dependent ERK signalling pathway previously characterized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. ERK1/2 are serine-threonine kinases that phosphorylate many cellular proteins, i.e. transcription factors, cytoskeletal proteins, membrane proteins and other kinases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Activated ERK translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, where it regulates gene transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Of note, in previous work we have characterized a cytoplasmic L1 mutant (hL1mutTS) devoid of the ERK phosphorylation site (Ser<sup>1248</sup>) that does not support L1-dependent gene regulation and ERK activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. We observed recently that L1mutTS-ICD does not translocate to the nucleus, although it is processed by ADAM10 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. In the present paper we found that DAPT or TAPI-0 treatment of L1-expressing HEK-293 cells did not affect ERK phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B). Similar observations were made when L1 was specifically depleted using siRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Although these results might suggest a less important role in ERK activation, it is still possible that L1 and ERK have to co-operate for L1 processing and/or transcriptional regulation. Further studies will need to uncover the contribution of each mechanism to the outcome of L1 signalling.</p><p>As lateral segregation of membrane proteins from their sheddases by cholesterol-rich microdomains seems to be a mechanism to control proteolysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>], we investigated the importance of L1 partition into lipid rafts for its ectodomain shedding. Using sucrose-density-gradient centrifugation, we showed that L1 distributes between lipid raft and non-raft domains. Moreover, we detected the proteolytic fragment L1-32 in both lipid raft and non-raft fractions. Knock-down of ADAM10 diminished the cleavage fragment in both membrane domains, whereas down-regulation of TACE had no effect. These data indicated that L1 is cleaved by ADAM10 independently of its distribution into lipid rafts. A similar finding was described for MT1-MMP (membrane type-1 matrix metalloproteinase), a membrane-anchored protease that is proteolytically released from the cell surface. The latter process is independent from lipid rafts, since both transmembrane and glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol-anchored MT1-MMP are shed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. Although partition of L1 into lipid rafts seems not to be crucial for its ectodomain shedding, disruption of lipid raft integrity by the cholesterol-binding drug nystatin completely abrogated L1 processing in these microdomains (S. Riedle, unpublished work).</p><p>L1-32 was also detected in non-raft domains floating above the loading zone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). Refined subcellular separation demonstrated that L1-32 co-fractionated with LAMP-1, a marker for late endosomes/lysosomes. By contrast, full-length L1 was hardly detectable in this fraction. L1-32 may be delivered to late endosomes/lysosomes selectively. It is also conceivable that full-length L1 is completely cleaved within these compartments. Growing evidence suggests a role for endosomes in the proteolysis of membrane proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. Further analysis has to define the subcellular localization of L1-cleavage. Nevertheless, identification of L1-32 in late endosomes/lysosomes suggests that these endocytic compartments are likely candidate sites for the proteolytic processing of L1.</p><p>Interestingly, the active &#x003b3;-secretase complex is also present in lipid rafts, although it seems not to be cholesterol-dependent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. We therefore investigated whether the PS/&#x003b3;-secretase-dependent processing of L1 is associated with lipid rafts. Using sucrose-density-gradient centrifugation we were unable to detect any considerable amount of PS1 CTF (C-terminal fragment) in the lipid raft fraction. This might be caused by the detergent used for the preparation, since the choice of detergent is critical for the detection of PS1 in lipid rafts. Mature components of the &#x003b3;-secretase complex are soluble in Triton X-100, but remain insoluble in Lubrol-WX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. Nevertheless, we observed an increase of L1-32 in the lipid raft fraction after DAPT treatment. Importantly, this accumulation was not restricted to lipid rafts, but was also apparent in non-raft domains. Overexpression of dominant-negative PS1 (D385N) confirmed these results. A similar result was found for embryonic mouse brains, where the majority of PS1, nicastrin (part of the secretase complex) and APP CTF remains soluble in Lubrol-WX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. Therefore our results support the notion that PS/&#x003b3;-secretase cleavage is not restricted to proteins that are localized in lipid rafts.</p><p>The biological significance of the lateral segregation of L1 into lipid raft and non-raft domains is presently unclear, but this segregation has been reported in neuronal cells for L1 and the related molecule neurofascin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. Our preliminary results suggest that raft resident L1 associates with caveolin-1 (S. Riedle, unpublished work). It should be noted that endocytosis of L1 via the clathrin-mediated pathway has been well characterized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. It is therefore tempting to speculate that distinct endocytic pathways are involved in the internalization of L1. Such different routes regulate the signalling and turnover of transforming-growth-factor-&#x003b2; receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>] and bone-morphogenic-protein receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. Further work needs to clarify whether the segregation of L1 into lipid raft and non-raft regions is required for its internalization via caveolae/rafts as against clathrin-dependent pathways.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Online data</title><supplementary-material id="SD1" content-type="local-data" position="float" xlink:type="simple"><caption><title>Supplementary data</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bj4200391add.pdf" position="float" xlink:type="simple"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><sec><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We thank Ms Natalie Erbe-Hofmann for excellent technical assistance.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>This work was supported by the <funding-source id="gs1">Deutsche Krebshilfe (Schwerpunktprogramm: Invasion and Migration)</funding-source> (to P.A.); and the <funding-source id="gs2">EU-FP6 OVCAD (European Commission Sixth Framework Programme Ovarian Cancer Diagnosis) project number PE-14034</funding-source>.</p></sec><ref-list><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Schachner</surname><given-names>M.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Neural recognition molecules and synaptic plasticity</article-title><source>Curr.
