The molecular mechanisms controlling receptor abundance are poorly understood. We tested whether abundance of postsynaptic glutamate receptors (GluRs) in <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuromuscular junctions is controlled by microRNAs, and provide evidence that it is. We show here that postsynaptic knockdown of dicer-1, the endoribonuclease necessary for microRNA synthesis, leads to large increases in postsynaptic GluR subunit messenger RNA and protein. Specifically, we measured increases in GluRIIA and GluRIIB but not GluRIIC. Further, knockout of <italic>MiR-284</italic>, a microRNA predicted to bind to GluRIIA and GluRIIB but not GluRIIC, increases expression of GluRIIA and GluRIIB but not GluRIIC proportional to the number of predicted binding sites in each transcript. Most of the de-repressed GluR protein, however, does not appear to be incorporated into functional receptors, and only minor changes in synaptic strength are observed, which suggests that microRNAs primarily regulate <italic>Drosophila</italic> receptor subunit composition rather than overall receptor abundance or synaptic strength.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Most synaptic transmission in mammalian brains occurs via glutamate receptors (GluRs). Synthesis and localization of GluRs is essential for brain development, and GluR changes underlie learning, memory, and many different neuropathologies. Several lines of evidence suggest that GluR synthesis may be regulated by microRNAs, which suppress gene expression in a variety of organisms and tissue types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lee et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baek et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Selbach et al., 2008</xref>). First, microRNAs are particularly abundant in brains, and have recently been shown to play important roles in several aspects of nervous system development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cao et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bicker and Schratt, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fiore et al., 2008</xref>). Second, some postsynaptic proteins, possibly including GluR subunits, seem to be locally translated near postsynaptic densities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sigrist et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Job and Eberwine, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Miller et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sutton et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sutton and Schuman, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Martin and Zukin, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pfeiffer and Huber, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schuman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bramham, 2008</xref>), whereas the microRNA synthesis protein dicer and many microRNAs themselves may be enriched at synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lugli et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">2008</xref>). Finally, acetylcholine receptor abundance in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) has recently been shown to be regulated by microRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Simon et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Here, we test whether GluR synthesis in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> is regulated by microRNAs. <italic>Drosophila</italic> NMJs are glutamatergic synapses that are individually identifiable at the cellular level and experimentally accessible throughout development in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Keshishian et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Featherstone and Broadie, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ruiz-Canada and Budnik, 2006</xref>). <italic>Drosophila</italic> NMJs contain two biophysically, pharmacologically, and spatially distinct subtypes of ionotropic GluRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">DiAntonio et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Marrus et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Featherstone et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Qin et al., 2005</xref>), called &#x0201c;A type&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;B type.&#x0201d; A-type receptors contain the subunit GluRIIA but not GluRIIB, plus the subunits GluRIIC (also known as GluRIII), GluRIID, and GluRIIE. B-type receptors contain GluRIIB but not GluRIIA, plus GluRIIC, GluRIID, and GluRIIE.</p><p>Our results show that microRNAs strongly regulate the abundance of <italic>GluRIIA</italic> and <italic>GluRIIB</italic> GluR subunit mRNAs, and that this has dramatic effects on relative subunit protein abundance. In the absence of microRNA-mediated subunit repression, GluRIIA and GluRIIB proteins accumulate in the cell; in the absence of a particular microRNA&#x02014;<italic>MiR-284</italic>&#x02014;GluR subunits accumulate such that receptor subtype ratios in the synapse are dramatically changed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Because microRNAs bind to target transcripts via base pairing, a variety of computational methods have been developed that compare the sequence of putative microRNAs with predicted transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rajewsky, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Watanabe et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bartel, 2009</xref>). If appropriate complementarity is detected, an interaction between the microRNA and transcript is presumed to occur in vivo. To determine whether <italic>Drosophila</italic> NMJ GluR transcripts might be regulated by microRNAs and identify candidate microRNAs for each subunit transcript, we bioinformatically screened the entire sequence of <italic>GluRIIA</italic>, <italic>GluRIIB</italic>, <italic>GluRIIC</italic>, <italic>GluRIID</italic>, and <italic>GluRIIE</italic> transcripts for potential microRNA-binding sites. We screened the entire transcript because although it was initially thought that microRNAs selectively associated with untranslated regions (UTRs) to inhibit target translation, microRNAs might also trigger target transcript degradation by binding to complementary sites wherever they might be found in a transcript.</p><p>Unfortunately, although we tried several different tools representing several different approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Enright et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stark et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brennecke et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Krek et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rusinov et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sethupathy et al., 2006</xref>), our bioinformatics experiments did not converge toward any usable predictions. To circumvent this problem, we considered a different approach. MicroRNA synthesis requires cleavage of stem-loop precursor RNAs by a protein complex containing the type III ribonuclease &#x0201c;dicer&#x0201d; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bernstein et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hutvagner et al., 2001</xref>). Indeed, the property of being processed by dicer is one of the classical definitions of a microRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berezikov et al., 2006</xref>). Therefore, if GluR transcripts are regulated by microRNAs, then they must also regulated (indirectly) by dicer. Specifically, eliminating dicer function should increase GluR protein abundance if GluR transcripts are regulated by microRNAs. Elimination of dicer should also cause an increase in GluR mRNA abundance if microRNAs regulate GluR transcript stability (as opposed to translation).</p><p>The <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome encodes two dicer paralogues: dicer-1 and dicer-2. Dicer-1 and dicer-2 interact with different sets of proteins and have functionally distinct roles in vivo: dicer-1 preferentially cleaves precursor microRNAs after they are exported from the nucleus, whereas dicer-2 preferentially cleaves exogenous double-stranded RNA, presumably as a defense against viral infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee et al., 2004</xref>). Elimination of dicer-1 function should therefore prevent synthesis of <italic>Drosophila</italic> microRNAs, allowing us to determine whether NMJ GluRs are regulated by microRNAs. Unfortunately, consistent with the fact that dicer is required for early development in every complex organism examined to date (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Giraldez et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Murchison et al., 2005</xref>), <italic>Drosophila</italic> dicer-1 mutants (<italic>Dcr-1[d102]</italic> and <italic>Dcr-1[1147X]</italic>) died in embryogenesis before proper NMJ formation and GluR expression. We also examined &#x0201c;semiviable&#x0201d; <italic>ago1[04845]</italic> mutants. Argonaute 1 (AGO1), like dicer-1, is thought to be preferentially required for microRNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Okamura et al., 2004</xref>). However, homozygous <italic>ago1[d04845]</italic> mutants, like dicer mutants, also died before normal NMJ formation and GluR expression.</p><p>As a result, we were unable to use dicer-1 (or AGO1) mutants to test whether NMJ GluRs are regulated by microRNAs. Such an analysis would have been, in any case, complicated by possible presynaptic microRNA-dependent changes affecting transsynaptic induction of receptor expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Broadie and Bate, 1993</xref>). However, the previously described segregation of dicer-1 and dicer-2 function in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee et al., 2004</xref>) suggested another possible approach. If dicer-1 is preferentially required for microRNA synthesis, but dicer-2 is preferentially required for processing of exogenous double-stranded RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee et al., 2004</xref>), then it should be possible to knock down dicer-1 function via RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>). RNAi knockdown of dicer-1 might be more permissive for development (and thus study of GluR expression) than mutants for two reasons: (1) RNAi typically reduces, but does not eliminate, target function; and (2) RNAi transgene expression in <italic>Drosophila</italic> can be temporally and spatially restricted using the <italic>Gal4</italic>&#x02013;<italic>UAS</italic> system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brand and Perrimon, 1993</xref>), allowing us to knock down dicer-1 only in postsynaptic muscle cells while leaving all other tissues as wild type.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Tissue-specific knockdown of dicer-1 by tissue-specific expression of dicer-1 RNAi.</bold> (A) Functional segregation of <italic>Drosophila</italic> dicer-1 (required for microRNA synthesis) and dicer-2 (required for RNAi) theoretically allows knockdown of dicer-1 protein by dicer-1 RNAi. (B) Images show a portion of a single ventral body wall hemisegment in a third instar <italic>Drosophila</italic> larva. Ventral longitudinal muscles 6 and 7 (VLM 6 and VLM 7) are labeled, as are the presynaptic motor terminals (stained with anti-HRP; magenta) that innervate these muscles. In control muscles (<italic>24Bgal4/+</italic>), dicer-1 immunoreactivity (green) appears most prominently as puncta scattered throughout the muscle, but also as a faint cytoplasmic haze. In animals expressing dicer-1 RNAi in muscle cells (<italic>24BGal4/UAS-dcr1.RNAi</italic>), the intensity of the dicer-1 immunoreactive haze and the number of dicer-1 puncta are significantly reduced, which is consistent with a large reduction in dicer-1 in these cells. The differences in dicer-1 immunoreactive puncta density and overall immunofluorescence are quantified and statistically compared in C and D (<italic>n</italic> = 6&#x02013;7 for each genotype).

Global expression of this transgene using a tubulin Gal4 driver (<italic>TubGal4/UAS-dcr1.RNAi</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lee and Luo, 1999</xref>) caused early embryonic lethality, similar to that observed in dicer-1 and AGO1 mutants. In contrast, expression of dicer-1 RNAi specifically in postsynaptic body wall muscles (<italic>24BGal4/UAS-dcr1.RNAi</italic>) allowed animals to hatch, feed, and develop through third instar larval stages. To confirm that body wall muscle dicer-1 was knocked down in these animals, and to quantify that knockdown, we examined dicer-1 antibody immunoreactivity in third instar larval body wall tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, B and C</xref>). In control animals, dicer-1 immunoreactivity was prominent as distinct puncta scattered throughout body wall muscle cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>). Presumably, these puncta represent micro ribonucleoprotein complexes, with which dicer proteins are thought to associate. However, we also observed dicer-1 immunoreactivity as a faint &#x0201c;haze&#x0201d; distributed throughout the muscle cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>). Body wall muscles expressing dicer-1 RNAi showed a dramatic decrease in both haze intensity and number of dicer-1 immunoreactive puncta, which is consistent with elimination of approximately two thirds of muscle dicer-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, B and D</xref>).</p><p>MicroRNAs can repress gene expression by decreasing target transcript abundance or by suppressing translation. To test whether NMJ GluR transcript abundance is dependent on dicer-1 (and thus regulated by microRNAs), we measured <italic>GluRIIA</italic> and <italic>GluRIIB</italic> transcript abundance (using quantitative real-time RT-PCR and FISH) in control animals and in animals expressing <italic>dicer-1</italic> RNAi specifically in postsynaptic body wall muscles (<italic>24BGal4/UAS-dcr1.RNAi</italic>). We focused on these two transcripts because GluRIIA and GluRIIB are thought to be rate-limiting for formation of A- and B-type GluRs, respectively; and <italic>GluRIIA</italic> and <italic>GluRIIB</italic> are expressed only in body wall muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">DiAntonio et al., 1999</xref>). Muscle-specific knockdown of <italic>dicer-1</italic> resulted in large statistically significant increases in <italic>GluRIIA</italic> and <italic>GluRIIB</italic> transcript abundance, as measured by real-time RT-PCR, which is consistent with the idea that stability of both transcripts is regulated by microRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>). To confirm these results, we used FISH to visualize <italic>GluRIIA</italic> and <italic>GluRIIB</italic> mRNA in body wall muscles of control larvae and larvae expressing <italic>dicer-1</italic> RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>).

We conclude, based on these results, that <italic>GluRIIA</italic> and <italic>GluRIIB</italic> transcripts are targets for microRNA-mediated repression, and that the microRNAs that repress <italic>GluRIIA</italic> and <italic>GluRIIB</italic> do so, at least in part, by reducing target transcript abundance. Presumably, this also affects GluRIIA and GluRIIB protein abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 D</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Dicer-1 knockdown leads to an increase in GluR mRNA.</bold> (A) Real-time RT-PCR shows that <italic>GluRIIA</italic> and <italic>GluRIIB</italic> mRNA is increased after expression of dicer-1 RNAi in postsynaptic muscles (<italic>24BGal4/UAS-dcr1.RNAi</italic>), compared with wild-type controls (<italic>n</italic> = 9&#x02013;10 of each genotype).

In control animals, most GluRIIA and GluRIIB protein is tightly localized at synapses, which is consistent with the role of A- and B-type receptors in NMJ transmission. In contrast, very little GluRIIA and GluRIIB immunoreactivity is detectable in wild-type nonsynaptic muscle cell regions. This small amount of immunoreactivity is consistent with a low density of functional nonsynaptic GluRs measured in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nishikawa and Kidokoro, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Featherstone et al., 2000</xref>).

In control NMJs, GluRIIA and GluRIIB protein is incorporated into multimeric GluRs that are localized almost exclusively at NMJs (marked with anti-HRP; blue).

Manually dissected <italic>24BGal4/UAS-dcr1.RNAi</italic> larvae were briefly incubated with the fixable nonpermeant membrane dye FM1-43FX, in order to label plasma membranes. These preparations were then fixed and stained with GluRIIA and GluRIIB antibodies to label GluRIIA and GluRIIB protein. To determine the spatial relationship of receptor subunit proteins and the muscle plasma membranes, we imaged labeled preparations by confocal microscopy and generated 3D reconstructions of the neuromusculature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>). As expected, we observed a high concentration of GluRIIA and GluRIIB immunoreactivity at NMJs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref>, arrows), which likely represents functional synaptic A- and B-type GluRs. There was also a relatively low density of GluRIIA and GluRIIB associated with extrasynaptic plasma membrane, which is consistent with the presence of some functional extrasynaptic receptors.

To determine whether extrasynaptic intracellular GluRIIA and GluRIIB immunoreactivity might represent assembled but intracellular GluRs, we examined immunoreactivity for the essential receptor subunit GluRIIC (also known as GluRIII; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Marrus et al., 2004</xref>).

Therefore, if GluRIIC immunoreactivity in <italic>24BGal4/UAS-dcr1.RNAi</italic> larvae is not associated with nonsynaptic GluRIIA or GluRIIB immunoreactivity, then the GluRIIA and GluRIIB immunoreactivity cannot represent assembled receptors. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>, GluRIIC immunoreactivity in <italic>24BGal4/UAS-dcr1.RNAi</italic> larvae matched that observed in controls. We therefore conclude that the abundant nonsynaptic intracellular GluRIIA and GluRIIB protein observed in <italic>24BGal4/UAS-dcr1.RNAi</italic> larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figs. 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>) represents GluR subunits unable to multimerize, perhaps because of the relatively restricted availability of other required subunits.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p><bold>Knockdown of dicer-1 does not alter abundance or distribution of GluRIIC protein.</bold> GluRIIC protein distribution is normal after muscle-specific knockdown of dicer-1; all GluRIIC remains tightly localized to NMJs in both control and 24BGal4/UAS&#x02013;dicer-1.RNAi larvae.

Electrophysiology is extremely sensitive to changes in functional GluR abundance and distribution; in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval NMJ, differences of only a few dozen individual postsynaptic receptors can be reliably detected and statistically differentiated using this method. First, we measured total synaptic strength by stimulating the presynaptic motor nerve and measuring the amplitude of the resulting postsynaptic excitatory junction currents (EJCs). EJCs in <italic>24BGal4/UAS-dcr1.RNAi</italic> larvae were slightly, but not significantly, larger than those in controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 A</xref>).

However, these data do not address the possibility that regulation of GluRIIA and GluRIIB occurs indirectly (via regulation of an unknown transcript that in turn regulates GluR transcript abundance and/or receptor assembly). Nor do the data reconcile the apparent discrepancy between bioinformatic predictions and the phenotypes observed in <italic>24BGal4/UAS-dcr1.RNAi</italic> larvae.

Many published algorithms predict no microRNA-binding sites in <italic>GluRIIA</italic>, <italic>GluRIIB</italic>, or <italic>GluRIIC</italic> transcripts, which suggests that these algorithms are too restrictive. Several of these algorithms assume highly complementary microRNA&#x02013;target binding, which has subsequently been shown to not be absolutely required for microRNA-mediated transcript inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rajewsky, 2006</xref>). In contrast, the &#x0201c;MicroInspector&#x0201d; algorithm of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rusinov et al.

Using default/recommended parameters (25&#x000b0;C hybridization, &#x02212;26 kcal/mol free energy cutoff), MicroInspector (version 1.0) predicted 106 binding sites for 43 different <italic>Drosophila</italic> microRNAs in the <italic>GluRIIA</italic> transcript, 91 binding sites for 43 different microRNAs in the <italic>GluRIIB</italic> transcript, and 132 binding sites for 45 different microRNAs in the <italic>GluRIIC</italic> transcript (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200902062/DC1">Tables S1&#x02013;S3</ext-link>).

Specifically, we describe regulation of GluRIIA and GluRIIB. Our conclusion that microRNAs suppress GluRIIA and GluRIIB abundance is based on several pieces of evidence: (1) quantitative real-time PCR showing an increase in <italic>GluRIIA</italic> and <italic>GluRIIB</italic> transcript abundance after dicer-1 knockdown; (2) FISH showing an increase in microscopically visible <italic>GluRIIA</italic> and <italic>GluRIIB</italic> mRNA after dicer-1 knockdown; (3) immunohistochemistry showing a dramatic increase in GluRIIA and GluRIIB protein after dicer-1 knockdown; (4) electrophysiology showing an increase in sEJC amplitude after dicer-1 knockdown; and (5) immunohistochemistry showing an increase in GluRIIA and GluRIIB protein after genetic deletion of <italic>MiR-284</italic>. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence for regulation of GluRs by small noncoding RNAs in any organism.</p><p>Because GluRIIA and GluRIIB are rate-limiting for GluR formation, and because <italic>MiR-284</italic> regulated GluRIIB more strongly compared with GluRIIA, changes in <italic>Mir-284</italic> activity lead to changes in the postsynaptic A-type/B-type receptor ratio. A- and B-type GluRs are biophysically and pharmacologically distinct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">DiAntonio et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Marrus et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schmid et al., 2008</xref>), and the A-type/B-type receptor ratio varies developmentally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schmid et al., 2008</xref>) and along the larval ventral&#x02013;dorsal axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee et al., 2008</xref>). MicroRNA-mediated regulation of GluR subunit transcripts, and <italic>MiR-284</italic> in particular, may explain how these developmental and spatial differences are achieved.</p><p>We also showed that RNAi can effectively knock down <italic>Drosophila</italic> dicer-1, which is in agreement with the conclusion that dicer-1 and dicer-2 play largely independent roles for processing and/or synthesis of microRNA and RNAi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee et al., 2004</xref>), and demonstrated that dicer-1 is predominantly localized to distinct puncta, which is consistent with the conclusion that micro ribonucleoprotein complexes aggregate in vivo. However, dicer-1 puncta were scattered throughout postsynaptic muscle cells, and not obviously associated with any particular organelle, the perinuclear region, or postsynaptic densities, as previously described for mouse brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lugli et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, <italic>Mir-284</italic> regulated GluR protein abundance in proportion to the number of predicted binding sites in each target transcript: <italic>GluRIIB</italic> had two predicted <italic>MiR-284</italic> binding sites, and was most strongly affected by loss of <italic>MiR-284</italic>; <italic>GluRIIA</italic>, with one predicted binding site, was less affected; and <italic>GluRIIC</italic>, with no predicted binding sites, was not affected at all. This suggests that microRNA-mediated regulation of any particular transcript may depend on the number and type of individual microRNA-binding sites, where more potential binding sites lead to stronger repression. Also, interestingly, none of the predicted <italic>MiR-284</italic> binding sites in either <italic>GluRIIA</italic> or <italic>GluRIIB</italic> were in UTRs.</p><p>However, as noted, we were unable to obtain consistent a priori bioinformatic predictions regarding the number and type of microRNA-binding sites in <italic>Drosophila</italic> GluR transcripts.

Real-time PCR was then performed on mRNAs of interest (GluRIIA, GluRIIB, and the control/standard actin 5c) using a thermocycler (Opticon 2; MJ Research) with SYBR green for amplicon detection and quantitation. Quantification of starting mRNA was computed according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Horz et al., (2004)</xref>. In brief, the cycle threshold (C(t)) values for the target (GluRIIA or GluRIIB) and an actin 5C control were determined for each sample, and the target was normalized to the control using the following calculation: &#x00394;C(t)sample = C(t)target &#x02212; C(t)actin 5C. Normalized sample C(t) values were then referenced to a wild-type control sample (the &#x0201c;calibrator&#x0201d;) to determine the relative amount of target mRNA in the test sample. The formula used for determining relative target levels was: &#x00394;&#x00394;C(t)sample = &#x00394;C(t)sample &#x02013; &#x00394;C(t)calibrator. The amount of target for each sample is reported as a ratio relative to the calibrator using: 2<sup>&#x02212;&#x00394;&#x00394;C(t)</sup>. Essentially, actin 5C serves as a control for RNA isolation and amplification in each sample, and the wild type provides a standard quantity of target transcript to which all samples are referenced. Other aspects of the calculation correct for the fact that PCR product abundance is logarithmically (rather than linearly) related to the starting template.</p></sec><sec><title>FISH</title><p>RNA probes were synthesized in vitro from full-length target cDNAs, using standard methods appropriate to the cDNA vector (e.g., SP6 RNA polymerase for vectors containing an SP6 promoter). cDNAs for <italic>GluRIIA</italic> and <italic>GluRIIB</italic> were gifts from S. Sigrist (Freie Universit&#x000e4;t Berlin, Berlin, Germany); GluRIIC cDNA was obtained from the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Genomics Resource Center. After synthesis, probes were shortened using alkaline hydrolysis for better penetration of tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cox et al., 1984</xref>), and precipitated using standard methods. In most cases, the probe was labeled with digoxigenin-UTP (DIG-UTP; Roche) during transcription and then eventually visualized using anti-DIG antibodies. In some cases, the synthesis reaction included an amine-modified UTP that could be subsequently directly labeled with a fluorophore (&#x0201c;FISH tag&#x0201d; kit; Invitrogen). In situ hybridization was then performed using standard methods similar to those described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Braissant and Wahli, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sigrist et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tomancak et al., 2002</xref>). In brief, manually filleted third instar larvae were fixed for 1 h in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline, and then permeabilized using TritonX-100. After fixation, larvae were incubated with probes at 55&#x000b0;C overnight, then stained with anti-HRP antibodies to visualize NMJs, and with either anti-DIG antibodies or fluorophores with affinity to amine-modified UTP for visualization of mRNA using confocal fluorescent microscopy.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunocytochemistry and confocal microscopy</title><p>For immunocytochemistry and confocal microscopy, animals were manually dissected and fixed in Bouin's fixative, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen and Featherstone, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2005</xref>). <italic>Drosophila</italic> dicer-1 mouse polyclonal antibody (A1031a; used at 1:1,000) was generated against the dicer-1&#x02013;specific peptide TRHLYEDPRQHSPGALTDLR by the CIM antibody core at Arizona State University, but is no longer available from this source due to loss of funding. Mouse monoclonal anti-GluRIIA, from a cell line made by C. Schuster (University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany) and available from University of Iowa's Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, was used at 1:100&#x02013;1:200 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Featherstone et al., 2002</xref>). Rabbit polyclonal anti-GluRIIB and rabbit polyclonal anti-GluRIIC, first described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Marrus et al. (2004)</xref> and subsequently replicated in our own laboratory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liebl et al., 2005</xref>), were used at 1:2,000. Fluorescently conjugated anti-HRP was used at 1:100&#x02013;1:200. Immunoreactivity was visualized using FITC, TRITC, or CY5-conjugated goat anti&#x02013;mouse/rabbit secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) at 1:400. For plasma membrane staining using the fixable membrane dye FM1-43FX (Invitrogen), dissected larval preparations were exposed to 5 &#x000b5;g/ml FM1-43FX in ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline for 1 min, then fixed immediately in Bouin's fixative. For imaging, preparations were mounted on slides in Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories). All images of NMJs are from ventral longitudinal muscles 6 and 7 in abdominal segments 3 and 4. Control and experimental preparations were always stained and imaged in parallel.</p><p>Images were captured using a laser scanning confocal system (Fluoview FV500 ; Olympus) running Fluoview software 4.3 with a 40&#x000d7;/1.3 NA UPlan-FIuar or a 60&#x000d7;/1.4 NA Plan-Apochromat objective lens (Olympus). All imaging was performed at room temperature (20&#x02212;23&#x000b0;C). Quantification of staining intensity was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Featherstone et al., 2001</xref>). In brief, fluorescence intensity of relevant structures from unaltered, unsaturated confocal maximum intensity projections was measured by manually selecting the region of interest in ImageJ and measuring the mean pixel intensity of that region. To control for differences in individual preparation immunoreactivity, excitation, fluorescence attenuation, and detection, we then subtracted the mean pixel intensity of a similarly sized region of unstained &#x0201c;background&#x0201d; in the same fluorescence wavelength channel in the same image. 3D isosurface reconstructions were performed using Amira 3.1 (Mercury Computer Systems). Photoshop CS2 was then used to crop images and adjust contrast for printing.</p><p>Microscopic puncta (dicer-1 immunoreactivity or GluR mRNA aggregates detected by FISH; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figs. 1 C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2 B</xref>) were counted manually or using Particle Counting macros in ImageJ 1.42 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/">http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/</ext-link>).
