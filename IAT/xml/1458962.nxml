Of some 40 genes regulated by USF1, several are involved in the molecular pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Although the <italic>USF1</italic> gene has been shown to have a critical role in the etiology of familial combined hyperlipidemia, which predisposes to early CVD, the gene's potential role as a risk factor for CVD events at the population level has not been established. Here we report the results from a prospective genetic&#x02013;epidemiological study of the association between the <italic>USF1</italic> variants, CVD, and mortality in two large Finnish cohorts. Haplotype-tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms exposing all common allelic variants of <italic>USF1</italic> were genotyped in a prospective case-cohort design with two distinct cohorts followed up during 1992&#x02013;2001 and 1997&#x02013;2003. The total number of follow-up years was 112,435 in 14,140 individuals, of which 2,225 were selected for genotyping based on the case-cohort study strategy. After adjustment for conventional risk factors, we observed an association of <italic>USF1</italic> with CVD and mortality among females.

To adequately evaluate the impact of a gene or a risk allele on the disease risk at the population level requires a prospective follow-up study, a golden standard in traditional epidemiology, in which risk factor(s) are measured at the beginning of the follow-up, and the diagnostic endpoints are registered as the study proceeds. We have in this study used two unique cohorts from Finland, the population in which the <italic>USF1</italic> gene was identified as an FCHL gene, to address the general significance of the <italic>USF1</italic> gene as a risk factor for CVD in population-based, prospective manner.

The number of individuals recruited in the FINRISK-97 cohort was larger than in the FINRISK-92 at the baseline of the study. However, since the follow-up time was shorter for the FINRISK-97, the number of person-years was smaller for this younger cohort (54,577 person-years in FINRISK-97 versus 57,858 person-years in FINRISK-92). We selected incident cases and random subcohorts from the FINRISK cohorts for genotyping of six htSNPs as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020069-g001">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0020069-t001">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0020069-t002">2</xref>.</p><p>The genotype frequencies of all six SNPs followed Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium at the 0.05 level among the subcohorts of the FINRISK study samples. The linkage disequilibrium (LD) structure of the <italic>USF1</italic> gene and haplotype tagging properties of the genotyped SNPs were examined combining the two subcohorts. The selected six htSNPs captured the common haplotypes of <italic>USF1</italic> well (all haplotypes with frequency &#x0003e; 4&#x00025; in SeattleSNPs database (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020069-g002">Figure 2</xref>) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020069-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d;). Due to the high LD across the <italic>USF1</italic> gene locus (D&#x02032; 0.995&#x02013;1.000 between all SNP pairs), only five haplotypes were observed. Importantly, based on the distribution of the SNP alleles into various haplotypes, it was evident that the SNP alleles unequivocally specified haplotypes; thus, the selected SNPs truly represented htSNPs for this gene.</p><p>The minor allele frequencies of the <italic>USF1</italic> SNPs varied from 11&#x00025; to 41&#x00025; in the subcohorts (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0020069-t003">Table 3</xref>). In both FINRISK cohorts, SNP <italic>rs2073658</italic> showed a difference in the minor allele frequency between the female incident CVD cases and the subcohort free of CVD (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.05 for FINRISK-92 and FINRISK-97 combined). This SNP represents the variant previously associated with FCHL in Finnish pedigrees, and in both cohorts the minor allele seemed to be more prevalent among incident female CVD cases when compared to subcohort females free of CVD. For another SNP, <italic>rs2774279,</italic> located 6.8 kb 5&#x02032; from <italic>rs2073658,</italic> the minor allele frequency was higher among the subcohort females free of CVD than among incident female CVD cases (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.03 for FINRISK-92 and FINRISK-97 combined), especially in the FINRISK-92 (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.008) study sample with a longer follow-up. The minor alleles of these two SNPs both tag one haplotype of <italic>USF1</italic>. The minor allele of <italic>rs2073658</italic> tags the most common <italic>USF1</italic> haplotype, and the minor allele of <italic>rs2774279</italic> tags the second most common haplotype of <italic>USF1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020069-g002">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>Cox proportional hazards regression analysis measuring time-to-event was used to estimate the risk of an incident CVD event or mortality during the follow-up period in relation to the <italic>USF1</italic> SNPs. Allele-specific hazard ratios for the six SNPs tested are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0020069-t004">Table 4</xref> for analyses testing the two FINRISK cohorts separately and for analyses pooling the cohorts.

The increased risk was evident especially among the FINRISK-97 females; however, the hazard ratio was increased also among the FINRISK-92 females, although it did not reach statistical significance. The second SNP showing a difference in the minor allele frequency between incident cases and subcohort free of CVD, <italic>rs2774279,</italic> was also associated with increased risk of incident CVD and mortality in time-to-event analysis. Risk of mortality was increased among the female carriers of the G-allele of <italic>rs2774279</italic> (HR 4.43; 95&#x00025; CI 1.58&#x02013;12.40; <italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.005). Again, the increased risk was observed especially among the FINRISK-97 females. Also, the risk of CVD was higher among female carriers of the <italic>rs2774279</italic> G-allele (HR 4.01; 95&#x00025; CI 1.30&#x02013;12.39; <italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.02), and the effect of the SNP was observed in both FINRISK cohorts. Among FINRISK-97 females, the effect of SNP <italic>rs2774279</italic> was visible when comparing carriers of the G-allele with others (HR 15.38; 95&#x00025; CI 2.49&#x02013;94.87; <italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.003). Interestingly, among the FINRISK-92 females, the effect of SNP <italic>rs2774279</italic> was observed when comparing carriers of the A-allele with others (HR 0.33; 95&#x00025; CI 0.13&#x02013;0.85; <italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.02).</p><p>No significant associations with the risk of an incident CVD event or mortality were observed among males in combined analysis of the two cohorts. Among FINRISK-92 males, a suggestive association was obtained for risk of mortality and the T-allele of SNP <italic>rs2516839</italic> (HR 1.83; 95&#x00025; CI 1.00&#x02013;3.36; <italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.05), and including FINRISK-92 females to the analysis further strengthened the results (HR 1.86; 95&#x00025; CI 1.13&#x02013;3.05; <italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.01). Otherwise, the only association seen in the pooled analyses of males and females was a decreased risk of CVD (HR 0.53; 95&#x00025; CI 0.30&#x02013;0.95; <italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.03) observed for carriers of the <italic>rs2073658</italic> C-allele when compared to noncarriers of the allele among the FINRISK-92 cohort.</p><p>We used permutation analysis to determine a critical <italic>p</italic>-value for 5&#x00025; level of significance corrected for multiple testing for our results; we permuted the genotype while retaining the phenotype data and repeated the same analyses that were performed with the actual dataset and repeated this procedure 1,000 times. In the time-to-event analyses where FINRISK-92 males and females were pooled together, permutation analysis suggested a critical <italic>p</italic>-value of 0.005 for a 5&#x00025; level of significance for both CVD risk and mortality risk. All other critical <italic>p</italic>-values obtained from permutation analysis can be seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0020069-t004">Table 4</xref>.</p><p>In our age-stratified study samples, the average age of the onset of CVD was about the same for males and females (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0020069-t002">Table 2</xref>). Since females generally have their first CVD event at an older age than men, we tested whether the observed sex difference was primarily due to a possible difference in relative age at event for males and females in our study sample. The time-to-event analysis combined for the two cohorts was repeated for males who had their first CVD event early (before age 55; <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 70), but no associations with CVD or mortality were observed (unpublished data).</p><p>The time-to-event results of individual htSNPs suggested that the <italic>rs2073658</italic> T-allele and <italic>rs2774279</italic> G-allele increase the risk of CVD and mortality among females. From the <italic>USF1</italic> haplotypes it was obvious that the <italic>rs2073658</italic> T-allele was present only in haplotype CTCTAG (population frequency 34&#x00025;) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020069-g002">Figure 2</xref>), thus specifying it as a risk-increasing haplotype. The <italic>rs2774279</italic> G-allele was present in all other haplotypes but the CCCTAA haplotype (population frequency 29&#x00025;), thus implying a protective role for this haplotype. We wanted to investigate more closely how the carriership of these haplotypes relates to the risk of CVD and mortality. Time-to-event analysis was performed to estimate the risk of CVD for females carrying the risk haplotype CTCTAG without the protective haplotype CCCTAA. The females carrying the risk haplotype CTCTAG, but without the protective haplotype CCCTAA, had the highest CVD risk when compared to any other group of haplotype carriers<bold>,</bold> this risk being 2.8-fold (HR 2.77; 95&#x00025; CI 1.50&#x02013;5.13; <italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.001). This result remained significant after correcting for multiple testing: In permutation analysis, the critical <italic>p</italic>-value for 5&#x00025; significance level was 0.003.</p><p>Finally, we tested whether the sequence variants of <italic>USF1</italic> have an effect on lipids, body mass index (BMI), or waist-to-hip circumference ratio, the traits characteristic of FCHL and other conditions with earlier-reported associations with <italic>USF1</italic> and known contributors to the CVD risk. The obtained results support previous findings of the best association observed for lipid values in males, and are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0020069-t005">Tables 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020069-st001">S1</xref>.</p><p>When males and females were analyzed together, significant associations among incident CVD cases were seen with higher levels of cholesterol and non-high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol with the C-allele of <italic>rs2073658</italic> (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.02 and <italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.02 for cholesterol and non-HDL cholesterol, respectively), C-allele of <italic>rs2516839</italic> (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001 and <italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.0001), and G-allele of <italic>rs1556259</italic> (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.01 and <italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.03).

In 60 Finnish FCHL families the risk was associated with the common allele of <italic>rs2073658</italic> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020069-b002">2</xref>&#x0005d;, whereas in the present study the SNP haplotype CTCTAG, carrying the minor allele of <italic>rs2073658,</italic> was associated with a risk effect. However, our original FCHL study did not address the female risk allele in any detail, since the most significant association was observed in males with high triglycerides. We performed a simple analysis of the original FCHL data, choosing families (32 out of 60) in which at least 50&#x00025; of those affected were female. Among these affected FCHL females the frequency of the minor allele of <italic>rs2073658</italic> (haplotype CTCTAG seen in FINRISK females) was higher than among the unaffected females of those families (45&#x00025; versus 38&#x00025;, respectively), thus supporting our findings. In addition, the frequency of the &#x0201c;protective&#x0201d; FINRISK haplotype CCCTAA was 23&#x00025; in affected females of those families and 30&#x00025; in unaffected females. Thus the obtained results of the &#x0201c;risk allele&#x0201d; of <italic>USF1</italic> in these two studies are comparable, although we recognize that the ascertainment strategy for the FCHL families results in a biased selection of population alleles and complicates the estimation of any sex-specific effect in these rare families. Many previous studies have found the influence of <italic>USF1</italic> to be more prominent among males &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020069-b002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020069-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;, or have studied only males &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020069-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;, whereas here we saw the most significant evidence of association among females. The lack of association among males at the population level in our cohorts could be explained by environmental covariates. CVD events are more common in males, most probably due to clustering of numerous lifestyle risk factors, including smoking, obesity, and high blood pressure, this increasing the environmental &#x0201c;noise&#x0201d; and complicating genetic analyses in males compared to females.</p><p>The association of <italic>USF1</italic> with CVD in females of two distinct population cohorts supports the real involvement of <italic>USF1</italic> in CVD risk. Moreover, the trends of the hazard ratios for the risk-associated alleles of <italic>USF1</italic> were the same in both FINRISK cohorts, and the same risk alleles of <italic>USF1</italic> were associated both with CVD events and all-cause mortality among females, further supporting their significance. Finally, correcting for multiple testing with permutations providing a more stringent significance threshold for the original <italic>p</italic>-values still retained a significant association between <italic>USF1</italic> variation and the risk of CVD and mortality among females.</p><p>In the association analyses of SNPs with lipid parameters, we observed <italic>USF1</italic> htSNPs to strongly associate with plasma cholesterol levels and non-HDL cholesterol especially among the male CVD cases. These findings confirm prior reports that <italic>USF1</italic> variants contribute to differences in lipid profiles &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020069-b002">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020069-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020069-b007">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020069-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;. However, no associations with traditional risk factors were obtained that would explain the increased risk of CVD and mortality among female carriers of <italic>USF1</italic> risk alleles. The question remains whether the impact of <italic>USF1</italic> on lipid parameters among females is as powerful as among males, or if the gene variants have alternative ways of increasing the CVD risk&#x02014;for example, through inflammation-related pathways.</p><p>As noted previously, the strong LD of the <italic>USF1</italic> locus extends the critical FCHL region to 46 kb in Finnish FCHL families &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020069-b002">2</xref>&#x0005d;. This DNA region may harbor additional variants that represent true functional variants that affect CVD risk. Sequencing of the complete region in sufficiently large study samples would shed light on the risk-increasing variants of <italic>USF1,</italic> and would enable the detailed functional studies needed to establish their role. So far, functional data exist only for the most significantly associated SNP of the original FCHL study, <italic>rs2073658</italic> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020069-b001">1</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>In conclusion, here we have shown that the risk effect of a gene identified in a rare set of FCHL families who are at exceptionally high risk for cardiovascular events can be confirmed in a population-based prospective follow-up study. We observed one &#x0201c;risk&#x0201d; and one &#x0201c;protective&#x0201d; allelic haplotype of <italic>USF1</italic> that significantly contribute to the risk for CVD and all-cause mortality among females. To evaluate the significance of these results obtained in the Finnish cohorts for CVD risk more globally, other populations need to be analyzed. Still, this study demonstrates, to our knowledge for the first time, that <italic>USF1</italic> gene variation may have a long-term predictive effect on CVD risk in females, and thus adds another piece of proof to the accumulating evidence that the gene plays an important role in the progression of CVD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Study populations.</title><p>Our population cohorts were collected via the FINRISK &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020069-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d; studies. FINRISK surveys are carried out every 5 y and are designed to assess the prevalence and risk factors of cardiovascular diseases in Finland. The FINRISK-92 study contacted a random sample of 8,000 persons aged 25&#x02013;64 y from four geographical areas of Finland (Helsinki region, southwestern Finland, North Karelia, and Kuopio region) as part of the WHO MONICA Project (Multinational Monitoring of Trends and Determinants in Cardiovascular Disease, an international study conducted under the auspices of the World Health Organization) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020069-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;.

In addition, 250 females and 500 males aged 65&#x02013;74 y were included from two of the areas. At the beginning of the follow-up period, the overall response rates covering participants with all required information for the genetic study were 71&#x00025; for males and 79&#x00025; for females in the FINRISK-92 study, and 68&#x00025; for males and 74&#x00025; for females in the FINRISK-97 study, resulting in a total of 14,140 participants out of the 19,500 in the original sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020069-g001">Figure 1</xref>).

The physical examination included blood pressure, waist, hip, weight, and height measurements. The self-administered questionnaire asked respondents for information on the most established environmental cardiovascular risk factors, e.g., demographic variables, history of CVD, history of diabetes, medication, smoking, and additional lifestyle and dietary habits. Blood was collected in a &#x0201c;semifasting&#x0201d; state, i.e., the participants were instructed to fast for 4 h and to avoid fatty meals earlier during the day.

Whole blood was stored at &#x02212;20 &#x000b0;C for DNA extraction.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Case-cohort design.</title><p>We used a case-cohort design &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020069-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;, in which DNA was genotyped only for stratified random samples&#x02014;subcohorts&#x02014;of the FINRISK-92 and &#x02212;97 cohorts, and for participants experiencing death, coronary event, or stroke during the follow-up periods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020069-g001">Figure 1</xref>). In addition, DNA of participants experiencing venous thromboembolic event or reporting history of CVD at the baseline examination was genotyped (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ktl.fi/publications/morgam/cohorts">http://www.ktl.fi/publications/morgam/cohorts</ext-link>); however, venous thromboembolism and baseline CVD were not analyzed as endpoints in our genetic study. Further, participants with prevalent CVD were excluded from our genetic analyses, except when analyzing all-cause mortality, for which all subcohort members and all deaths were included regardless of their CVD history. Information about coronary and stroke events during the follow-up periods was obtained from several sources: specific myocardial infarction and stroke registers (FINAMI &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020069-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d; and FINSTROKE &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020069-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d;) complemented with record linkage of the study data with the National Causes of Death Register and the National Hospital Discharge Register. These country-wide, computerized registers cover every death of Finnish citizens and every hospitalization in Finland, and thus the coverage of follow-up for symptomatic CVD events was almost 100&#x00025;. In the National Causes of Death Register International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-9 codes 410&#x02013;414 and 798, and ICD-10 codes I21&#x02013;I25, I46, R96, R98 and R99 were taken as coronary deaths.

In the National Hospital Discharge Register ICD-9 codes 410&#x02013;411, and ICD-10 codes I21&#x02013;I22 and I20.0, were taken as nonfatal coronary events; and ICD-9 codes 433 (excluding 4330X, 4331X, 4339X) and 434 (excluding 4349X), and ICD-10 code I63, were taken as nonfatal ischemic stroke events. ICD-9 was used in Finland until 31 December 1995, and ICD-10 after that. The combination of FINAMI register and the National Hospital Discharge Register was also used to identify revascularization procedures (CABG and PTCA) during the follow-up period.
