AMACR was first found overexpressed in prostate cancer but not in benign glands and is now an established diagnostic marker for prostate cancer. Aberrant expression of AMACR was recently reported in Cca; however, little is known about how this gene is abnormally activated in cancer. By using a panel of immunostained-laser-capture-microdissected clinical samples comprising the entire colon adenoma&#x02013;carcinoma sequence, we show that deregulation of <italic>AMACR</italic> during colon carcinogenesis involves two nonrandom events, resulting in the mutually exclusive existence of double-deletion at CG3 and CG10 and deletion of CG12-16 in a newly identified CpG island within the core promoter of <italic>AMACR</italic>. The double-deletion at CG3 and CG10 was found to be a somatic lesion. It existed in histologically normal colonic glands and tubular adenomas with low AMACR expression and was absent in villous adenomas and all CCas expressing variable levels of AMACR. In contrast, deletion of CG12-16 was shown to be a constitutional allele with a frequency of 43&#x00025; in a general population. Its prevalence reached 89&#x00025; in moderately differentiated CCas strongly expressing AMACR but only existed at 14&#x00025; in poorly differentiated CCas expressing little or no AMACR. The DNA sequences housing these deletions were found to be putative <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements for Sp1 at CG3 and CG10, and ZNF202 at CG12-16. Chromatin immunoprecipitation, siRNA knockdown, gel shift assay, ectopic expression, and promoter analyses supported the regulation by Sp1 and ZNF202 of <italic>AMACR</italic> gene expression in an opposite manner. Our findings identified key <italic>in vivo</italic> events and novel transcription factors responsible for <italic>AMACR</italic> regulation in CCas and suggested these <italic>AMACR</italic> deletions may have diagnostic/prognostic value for colon carcinogenesis.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Men consuming high amounts of red meat and dairy products are at a higher risk of developing colon and prostate cancer. Alpha-methylacyl-coenzyme A racemase (AMACR) is an enzyme that helps to break down fat from these foods to produce energy. An increase in the utilization of energy from fat is a hallmark of many cancers including colon and prostate cancers. Indeed, the <italic>AMACR</italic> gene was first found to be abnormally active in prostate cancers, and its abnormal expression has become a diagnostic marker for the cancer. However, little is known about how <italic>AMACR</italic> becomes activated in cancer cells. Here, we show that <italic>AMACR</italic> is also highly expressed in certain stages of colon cancer, though not all stages. A close examination of the <italic>AMACR</italic> gene in a panel of normal and progressively malignant colon tissues reveals that deletions of specific sequences in the <italic>AMACR</italic> gene may trigger its abnormal expression during the evolution of colon cancer. We also identify unique proteins known as &#x0201c;transcription factors&#x0201d; that normally bind to these deleted sequences to maintain normal expression of the gene. Finally, we report a new deletion variant of the <italic>AMACR</italic> gene in the general population that may influence the course of colon carcinogenesis.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="15"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase (AMACR) is a peroxisomal and mitochondrial enzyme that is indispensable in the catabolism of phytol-derived, 2-methyl-branched-chain fatty acids and the synthesis of bile acids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000334-Ferdinandusse1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. In hepatocytes, AMACR catalyzes the conversion of pristanoyl-CoA and C27-bile acyl-CoAs from R- to S-stereoisomers, which are the only stereoisomers that can undergo &#x003b2;-oxidation. Bile acid intermediates undergo one round of &#x003b2;-oxidation in the peroxisomes and are secreted. In contrast, branched-chain fatty acid derivatives are transported to mitochondria, where they are further degraded to generate biological energy.

The sequences of these deletion and mutation variants were deposited to Genbank with the accession number from EF636492 to EF636496. Cluster analyses demonstrated that deletion of CG12-16 was the most common co-occurrence, followed by deletion at CG3 and CG10 (double-deletion at CG3 and CG10) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000334-g003">Figure 3A</xref>).

The higher the number of clones with two specific CG deletions, the closer they are in the dendrogram. The hotspots were restricted to CG3, 10, and 12-16.

First, bisulfite modification reduced the GC content to &#x0223c;41&#x00025; in the 222-bp <italic>AMACR</italic> promoter CGI, which made the sequencing easier to read; second, visual examination of sequencing chromatogram files showed clean and discrete peaks in the CGI region, indicating that the deletions we observed in bisulfite sequencing were not due to a GC compression artifact (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000334.s002">Figure S2A</xref>). In addition, as an internal control to ensure complete bisulfite modification, we routinely examined and found that almost 100&#x00025; of the non-CpG cytosines in this region were converted to T, indicating complete bisulfite modification.</p><p>To demonstrate that the CG12-16 deletion was not due to the PCR artifact, we used sequencing-verified plasmids with or without CG12-16 deletion as PCR templates, the PCR products showed expected size with different positions in 3&#x00025; agarose gel (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000334.s002">Figure S2B</xref>, left panel).

Results demonstrated the sizes of the amplicons derived from wild-type and deletion-variant templates were consistent, indicating that the deletion of CG12-16 was neither a PCR artifact nor a result of bisulfite-treatment.</p><p>Blast searches provide additional evidence that the CG12-16 deletion exists in the human genome, as of the two genome sequences, one is the reference assembly that corresponds to the sequence (NT_006576.15) without CG12-16 deletion and the other is the Celera assembly (NW_922562.1) exhibiting the deletion, which exactly matches what we discovered in the <italic>AMACR</italic> promoter in clinical samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000334.s002">Figure S2C</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we conducted parallel bisulfite and regular sequencing on DNA isolated from LCM-captured normal or malignant colon epithelial cells from 9 colon specimens. Identical sequence results were obtained with the two methods (data not shown). Thus, in conclusion, these control experiments and <italic>in silico</italic> analyses demonstrate that the observed deletion hotspots in this CGI exist in colon tissues and are not results of artifacts generated from bisulfite-treatment, PCR or sequencing.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Deletion of CG12-16 and Double CG3 and 10 Deletions Are Mutually Exclusive Molecular Events that Appear to Underlie AMACR Expression and CCa Development</title><p>We then investigated the relationship between deletion patterns in the <italic>AMACR</italic> promoter CGI and levels of AMACR expression (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000334-t002">Table 2, left</xref>) in 55 iLCM samples to gain insight into how these deletions might affect gene expression <italic>in vivo</italic>.

Sp1 and ZNF202 appear to regulate <italic>AMACR</italic> expression in an opposite manner.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>The main objective of this study was to elucidate the regulatory mechanism underpinning <italic>AMACR</italic> gene expression in relation to CCa development. We identified a novel CGI upstream the translation start site in the proximal core promoter of <italic>AMACR</italic>. Although aberrant methylation of promoter CGIs is a common cause of transcriptional deregulation of genes involved in tumorigenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000334-Esteller1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>, we found that <italic>AMACR</italic> activation did not occur by this mechanism during colon carcinogenesis. Instead, we found that two non-random, mutually exclusive <italic>in vivo</italic> events, involving a double-deletion at CG3 and 10 and the deletion of CG12-16, play essential but opposite roles in the process. Additionally, we discovered the differential &#x0201c;origins&#x0201d; of these two <italic>in vivo</italic> deletions by comparing sequencing data from blood DNA in a general population and those from LCM-microdissected colon samples. The deletion of CG12-16 in the <italic>AMACR</italic> 5&#x02032; CGI was found to be a constitutional allele with a frequency of 43&#x00025; in a general population. In contrast, deletions at CG3 and/or CG10 were not observed in the blood samples indicating that these are genetic events occurring in somatic cells of the colon.</p><p>We observed a strong positive correlation between AMACR expression and the sequence of adenoma-carcinoma progression, suggesting a promotional function of AMACR in colon carcinogenesis. This postulate agrees with recent studies reporting that siRNA-mediated knockdown of <italic>AMACR</italic> mRNA or inhibition of the enzyme activity effectively curbed the growth of PCa cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000334-Zha1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000334-Carnell1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Intriguingly, both gene expression and CCa progression were closely correlated with the status of two mutually exclusive deletions found in the iLCM samples. Specifically, the double CG3 and 10 deletion was found only in histologically normal colonic glands and TAs that had negligible to absent AMACR expression and was absent in VA or CCas of all grades that had variable levels of AMACR expression. More important, the simultaneous deletion of these two sites effectively negated <italic>AMACR</italic> transactivation in HCT 116. We therefore propose that deletion at CG3 and 10 may effectively obviate colon carcinogenesis, possibly by impeding AMACR expression <italic>in vivo</italic>. In this regard, adenomas harboring double-deletions of CG3 and 10 might have a low likelihood of development to CCas; its potential diagnostic value merit further study.</p><p>In contrast to CG3 and 10 double-deletions, deletions of CG12-16 were highly prevalent in well- and moderately differentiated CCas that strongly expressed AMACR. This finding is impressive because it stands in stark contrast with the classical view that deletions cause functional inactivation of genes. In this instance, the CG12-16 deletion in the <italic>AMACR</italic> promoter CGI behaves like a &#x0201c;gain-of-function&#x0201d; deletion. When viewed in this context, the CG12-16 deletion may be part of the sequential genetic changes that occur in tumor suppressors, DNA repair genes, and oncogenes during the development of CCas from adenomatous lesions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000334-Benito1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Unlike the better differentiated CCas, most poorly differentiated cancers had a low percentage of deletions at CG12-16 and lacked AMACR expression. These cancers also had very few other aberrations including the double-deletion at CG3 and 10, in their <italic>AMACR</italic> promoter CGI. Because the gene is not silenced by DNA methylation, or by irreversible genetic events such as deletions, we have to consider the possibility that these cancers may have a clonal origin different from that of the better differentiated carcinomas. Alternatively, during their evolution, these cancers may acquire a metabolic phenotype that is independent of AMACR overexpression.</p><p>Much could be learned about the relationship between the CG12-16 deletion polymorphism and CCa risk by comparing the allelic frequency of this sequence variant in blood samples (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000334-t003">Table 3</xref> &#x00026; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000334-t004">4</xref>) to those found in LCM-captured histological entities of the colon (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000334-t001">Table 1</xref>). The overall allelic frequency of this deletion amongst the 239 alleles from the various histological entities of the colon was found to be &#x0223c;42&#x00025; (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000334-t001">Table 1, row 1</xref>), which matches the allele frequency observed in the blood samples is &#x0223c;43&#x00025;. This suggests that there may not be additional somatic events altering the frequency of this constitutional sequence in the colon. Yet, the prevalence of this lesion reaches 89&#x00025; in the moderately differentiated CCas, which showed significant difference (<italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.05) compared to the normal, TA, VA and poorly differentiated but not the well differentiated samples. Collectively, these data adds up to the hypothesis that individuals with the CG12-16 deletion variant are more likely to develop CCas that are well or moderately differentiated. Conversely, those carrying the wild type variant may be more prone to develop poorly differentiated CCas. Clearly, such a provocative hypothesis would have to await a well-designed population study for confirmation.</p><p>Contributing significantly to our understanding of how <italic>AMACR</italic> is regulated, we here provide the first evidence that deletion hotspots in the <italic>AMACR</italic> promoter CGI correspond to <italic>cis</italic>-elements for Sp1 and that this transcription factor regulates AMACR expression. Our data support the regulation of <italic>AMACR</italic> by Sp1, as ChIP assays showed Sp1 binding to a region of the <italic>AMACR</italic> promoter CGI containing the predicted sites and siRNA-mediated <italic>Sp1</italic> knockdown decreased <italic>AMACR</italic> mRNA levels in HCT 116. Reporter assays revealed that single deletion at either CG3 or CG10 did not affect <italic>AMACR</italic> transcription, whereas the double-deletion significantly abrogated the promoter activity, suggesting that the integrity of one site at either CG3 or CG10 is sufficient to maintain the promoter activity.</p><p>In contrast, deletion of CG12-16 enhanced <italic>AMACR</italic> transcription, signifying the likely presence of a repressor binding site in this region. We did not perform a ChIP assay for ZNF202 because no antibody was commercially available for the immunoprecipitation. However, results from gel shift assays were highly suggestive of the existence of a non-canonical ZNF202 binding site within this sequence. Our finding that ectopic overexpression of ZNF202 reduced <italic>AMACR</italic> promoter activity lends credence to this notion. However, we are aware of the fact that these data did not provide the definitive evidence that the CG12-16 sequence contains a ZNF202 <italic>cis</italic>-element, which still awaits a formal demonstration in future investigations. It is always possible that some unknown transcription factors other than ZNF202 could be involved in this regulation.</p><p>Intriguingly, ZNF202 is a transcriptional repressor for genes affecting the vascular endothelium as well as lipid metabolism. We have examined the promoters of five other ZNF202 target genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000334-Wagner1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000334-Langmann1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000334-Stene1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref> (<italic>apoA4</italic>, <italic>apoE</italic>, <italic>lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase</italic>, <italic>lipoprotein lipase</italic>, and <italic>phospholipid transfer protein</italic>) and did not find deletions or other aberrations in their ZNF202 <italic>cis</italic>-element in colon and prostate cancer cells (unpublished data). Thus, the activation of <italic>AMACR</italic> via deletion of a ZNF202 <italic>cis</italic>-element would be a phenomenon unique to <italic>AMACR</italic> gene regulation, if the CG12-16 sequence was shown to house this element. Several epidemiologic and animal studies have observed associations between the risk of metabolic syndromes/coronary heart diseases and the prevalence of colon adenomas/carcinomas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000334-Wang1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000334-Trichopoulou1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. Perhaps the loss of ZNF202-mediated repression of specific target genes, including <italic>AMACR</italic>, is a common cause of these diseases. Apropos of this view, carcinogenesis is being recognized increasingly as a metabolic disorder characterized by a shift from glycolysis to fatty acid utilization as the energy source fueling cell growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000334-Baron1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Finally, deletion of the CCAAT enhancer resulted in the loss of promoter activity regardless of the status of other elements, indicating that CCAAT enhancers are part of the basal transcriptional complex for <italic>AMACR</italic>. However, we did not find alterations in this <italic>cis</italic>-element in the iLCM samples, suggesting that such alterations do not contribute to aberrant expression of AMACR during colon carcinogenesis.</p><p>At present, it is unclear how the deletions at in the <italic>AMACR</italic> promoter arise. However, first, we noticed that deletion hotspots at CG3 and CG10 are also methylation hotspots (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000334-t001">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000334-t004">Table 4</xref>). It has been reported that methylated CG sites are mutation hotspots <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000334-Pfeifer1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref> as suggested in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000334.s003">Figure S3A</xref>. Second, scrutiny of the CGI sequence revealed two 7 nt direct repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000334-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). We postulated that forward slipped-strand mispairing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000334-Efstratiadis1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000334-OronKarni1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref> of the repeats, may result in the CG12-16 deletion during DNA replication (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000334.s003">Figure S3B</xref>). If this mispairing happens, such slippage will cause the exact 20 bp deletion found in <italic>AMACR</italic> promoter. These proposed mechanisms speculated to be responsible for these deletions will of course have to await future experiments for corroboration.</p><p>Collectively, we identified two major types of <italic>in vivo</italic> deletions in the <italic>AMACR</italic> promoter that appear to modulate gene expression and may play contrasting roles in carcinogenesis. In essence, a double-deletion at CG3 and 10 prevents AMACR overexpression and may impede colon carcinogenesis. In contrast, carriers of sequence variants with or without the CG12-16 deletion may have different propensity to develop well/moderately differentiated CCas versus the poorly differentiated cancers. Finally, our data suggest that these deletion hotspots are <italic>cis</italic>-elements for Sp1 at CG3 or CG10 and for ZNF202 at CG12-16. The proposed mechanisms for <italic>AMACR</italic> promoter regulation and the deletion hotspots provided important platforms for the further study of <italic>AMACR</italic> gene deregulation during carcinogenesis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Samples</title><p>Archival specimens were obtained from the Department of Pathology at the University of Massachusetts Medical School.
