Since gene expression in somatic mouse tissues is highly sex specific <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001435-Wang1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001435-Yang1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, we analyzed eQTLs separately in males and females. We limited our analysis to transcripts that were expressed in at least 1/3 of the samples within each sex, using this liberal cut off so as not to omit transcripts that expressed in only one of the parental strains. The female sample had 21,798 expressed transcripts, with 17,986 (82&#x00025;) of these transcripts expressed in at least 75&#x00025; of the female samples. Due to presence of multiple probes for some genes, these 21,798 transcripts represent only 11,531 unique genes.

We used an initial suggestive LOD cutoff of &#x02265;3.0. With 2 degrees of freedom, this suggestive LOD threshold corresponds to a nominal p-value of 1&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001435-Lander1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. We calculated a genome wide p-value of 0.25 for this LOD threshold by 1000 permutations each of 10 randomly selected female eQTLs with a LOD score of 3.00. We identified a total of 9,308 eQTLs in the female mice that met this suggestive LOD threshold, and applying our genome wide p-value at this threshold, we expect &#x0223c;7000 of these eQTLs to be authentic. We characterized as cis eQTLs those in which the eQTL mapped on the same chromosome and within 20 Mb of the transcript location on the mouse genome. All of the remaining eQTLs were identified as either trans eQTLs (eQTL maps at a different locus than the transcript), or ambiguous eQTLs for which the Affymetrix probe target sequence matched to more than one genomic location. There were 1,859 cis eQTLs in the female mice, representing 20&#x00025; of the total eQTLs, and their average LOD score was 8.77. There were 6,117 trans eQTLs in the female mice, representing 66&#x00025; of the total eQTLs, and their average LOD score was 3.55.

For the 19 autosomes and the X chromosome, we identified 12,361 eQTLs with a LOD score of &#x02265;3.0. We calculated a genome wide p-value of 0.25 for this LOD threshold by 1000 permutations each of 10 male eQTLs with a LOD score of 3.00. There were 1,990 cis eQTLs, representing 16&#x00025; of the total male eQTLs, and their average LOD score was 9.46. There were 8,625 trans eQTLs, representing 70&#x00025; of the total eQTLs, and their average LOD score was 3.64. There were also 1,746 ambiguous eQTLs, representing 14&#x00025; of the total, with an average LOD score of 5.07. As our strain intercross used males from both strains, we also looked for eQTLs due to the grandparental Y chromosome, and we detected 1145 that met the LOD&#x0003e;3.0 threshold. 90&#x00025; of these were trans eQTLs, 10&#x00025; were ambiguous eQTLs, with only 4 potentially cis eQTLs, associated with probes mapping to the Y chromosome (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0001435-t001">Table 1</xref>).

There were non-random distributions in both female and male cohorts. In the female samples there were 11 hotspots of eQTLs, each having over 200 eQTLs (&#x0003e;2&#x00025; of all female eQTLs), with the largest peak on chromosome 7 in a bin that had 339 eQTLs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001435-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). There were 2 hotspots on the X chromosome in the females, and overall there were 861 eQTLs on the X chromosome (11 cis, 698 trans, and 170 ambiguous). In the males there were 13 hotspots with over 200 eQTLs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001435-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). The male data yielded three super hotspots each containing between 8.5 to 11.5&#x00025; of all the male eQTLs, one near the proximal end of chromosome 1 containing 1316 eQTLs, one on chromosome 16 containing 1434 eQTLs, and one for the entire Y chromosome containing 1145 eQTLs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001435-g001">Fig 1B</xref>). Gene ontology analysis did not detect over representation in any functional group of the transcripts in the chromosome 1 and 16 eQTL hotspots compared to all male eQTLs. For the transcripts associated with the Y chromosome eQTL hotspot compared to all eQTL associated transcripts on the autosomes and the X chromosome, the gene ontology analysis found several over represented classes including the chromosome and extracellular cellular components, the cell cycle M phase and DNA metabolic biological processes, and the microtubule motor activity molecular function (see Supplemental <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001435.s003">Table S3</xref> for full list and P values). There was only limited overlap of the eQTL hotspot positions in females and males, near the distal ends of chromosome 1 and 4, and near the proximal end of chromosomes 7 and 13. Interestingly, there were only 46 eQTLs in the male cohort that mapped to the X chromosome (20 cis, 11 trans, and 15 ambiguous), showing an unexpectedly large difference compared to the female cohort where 861 eQTLs mapped to the X chromosome.</p><fig id="pone-0001435-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0001435.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Genomic location of eQTLs.</title><p>Bone marrow derived macrophage eQTLs with LOD&#x02265;3.0 were mapped to partially overlapping 20 Mb bins in female (A) and male (B) F<sub>2</sub> mice.

Among these sex-shared cis eQTLs, the LOD scores for the female eQTLs were highly correlated with the LOD scores in males (r<sup>2</sup>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.71, p&#x0003c;0.0001), highlighting the similarity of these shared eQTLs. A very different picture emerged from the trans eQTLs, with only 71 being shared between the sexes, representing only 1.2&#x00025; and 0.8&#x00025; of the female and male trans eQTLs, respectively. Supplemental <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001435.s005">Table S5</xref> details each of these 71 shared trans eQTLs that had mean LOD scores of 4.07 and 4.13 in the female and male cohorts, respectively.

There was some clustering of these sex-shared trans eQTLs, with 7 mapping to the proximal end of chromosome 1, 11 mapping to the distal end of chromosome 1, and 7 mapping to the distal end of chromosome 4. The gene ontology associations of the sex-shared trans eQTLs were statistically compared against all of the trans eQTLs. This analysis yielded no apparent clustering based on known gene functions, or any particular pathway in the sex shared trans eQTLs. There were also 243 sex-shared ambiguous eQTLs with very high average LOD scores (11.35 and 12.7 in females and males, respectively), indicating that most of these ambiguous eQTLs were actually cis eQTLs, but their probes were not uniquely assigned to the mouse genome (Supplemental <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001435.s006">Table S6</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="pone-0001435-t004" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0001435.t004</object-id><label>Table 4</label><caption><title>eQTLs shared by male and female F<sub>2</sub> mice.</title></caption><graphic id="pone-0001435-t004-4" xlink:href="pone.0001435.t004"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" alternate-form-of="pone-0001435-t004-4"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold><italic>Count</italic></bold></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold><italic>Ave. LOD female</italic></bold></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold><italic>Ave. LOD male</italic></bold></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold><italic>&#x00025; female shared</italic></bold></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><bold><italic>&#x00025; male shared</italic></bold></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="6" align="left" rowspan="1"><bold>LOD 3.0</bold></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Total shared eQTLs</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1,599</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10.31</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">13.17</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">17.2</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">13.0</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Cis shared eQTLs</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1,285 (80.2&#x00025;)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10.47</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">11.90</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">69.1</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">64.6</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Trans shared eQTLs</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">71 (4.6&#x00025;)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.07</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.13</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.2</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.82</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Ambiguous shared eQTLs</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">243 (15.2&#x00025;)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">11.35</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">12.70</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">18.2</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">13.9</td></tr><tr><td colspan="6" align="left" rowspan="1"><bold>LOD 4.3</bold></td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Total shared eQTLs</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1,151</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">12.65</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">14.36</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">52.9</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">38.5</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Cis shared eQTLs</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">965 (83.8&#x00025;)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">12.45</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">14.09</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">73.1</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">66.8</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Trans shared eQTLs</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">9 (0.8&#x00025;)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5.97</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6.82</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.7</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.83</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Ambiguous shared eQTLs</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">177 (15.4&#x00025;)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">14.05</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">16.21</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">53.6</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">38.6</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Significant eQTLs</title><p>We repeated the eQTL analysis using a significant LOD threshold of 4.3, yielding a nominal p value of 5&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001435-Lander1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. Permutation analysis revealed that the LOD 4.3 threshold yielded a genome wide p-value of 0.02 in both males and females. In the females, 2,177 eQTLs met this LOD threshold, with 1,321 cis eQTLs, representing 61&#x00025; of the total eQTLs, and 526 trans eQTLs, representing 24&#x00025; of the total eQTLs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0001435-t001">Table 1</xref>). There were also 330 ambiguous eQTLs (15&#x00025; of the total eQTLs) that had a very high average LOD score of 10.13. Again, this indicates that the majority of these ambiguous eQTLs were actually due to strongly associated cis eQTLs, but their probes were not uniquely assigned to the mouse genome.

Thus in both male and female mice, this more stringent LOD threshold eliminated most of the trans eQTLs but retained most of the cis eQTLs.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Significant eQTL Sharing Between the Sexes</title><p>We examined the LOD 4.3 threshold eQTLs on the autosomes and the X chromosome to determine how many were shared between the female and male cohorts (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0001435-t004">Table 4</xref>). 965 cis eQTLs were shared, representing 73&#x00025; of the female and 67&#x00025; of the male cis eQTLs at this stringency. Only nine trans eQTLs at this LOD threshold in both sexes were shared in females and males, representing 1.7&#x00025; and 0.8&#x00025; of the female and male trans eQTLs, respectively. These nine shared trans eQTLs had mean LOD scores of 5.97 and 6.82 in the female and male cohorts, respectively.</p><p>This very low level of sharing could be due to most of the trans eQTLs being sex-specific, or alternatively, most of the trans eQTLs could be false positives. In order to examine this further, we assembled a new set of transcripts that were called present in &#x0003e;1/3 of the pooled male and female expression data, thus enabling new analyses on a single set of transcripts for both sexes. We repeated the eQTL analysis six more times, once using the correct sex assignment, and five times with permuted sex assignments while preserving the number of males and females. At the LOD 4.3 threshold there were 414 and 1132 trans eQTLs in the females and males, respectively, using the correct sex assignments, with a total of 1546 trans eQTLs and 40 shared in both sexes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0001435-t005">Table 5</xref>). If the trans eQTLs are primarily sex-specific, we would expect a large decrease in their numbers in the permuted datasets. There were on average 642 and 677 trans eQTLs in the permuted female and male datasets, respectively, with an average total of 1319 trans eQTLs and of 40 shared trans eQTLs in both sexes. Since the number of total trans eQTLs was only decreased by an average of 15&#x00025; in the permuted datasets compared to the correct sex assignments, it is possible that many of the trans eQTLs are false positives. However, for the male cohort, there was an average 40&#x00025; decrease in the number of trans eQTLs in the permuted datasets, suggesting that many of the male trans eQTLs may be authentic.

We pooled the male and female expression data, and set an arbitrary cutoff for expressed genes, in that the transcript must have been called expressed in 1/3 of the pooled samples. Altogether, there were 22,056 transcripts that met this criterion. We then performed non-parametric Mann Whitney tests to determine which of these were expressed differently in the male and female macrophages. Remarkably 6,719 transcripts (31&#x00025;) were expressed differently with p-values&#x0003c;2.27&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;6</sup>, meeting the conservative Bonferroni corrected p-value of &#x0003c;0.05. Since the RNA under study was derived from cells cultured two weeks <italic>ex vivo</italic>, these sex effects on gene expression are likely attributable to X and Y chromosome dosage effects, rather than to endogenous and variable sex steroids in the F<sub>2</sub> mice. About half of these (3,304) were expressed higher in female macrophages (female bias), and the other half (3,415) were expressed higher in male macrophages (male bias). These sex biased genes had a large range of fold differences between the sexes, with most having only modest effects of 1.2 to 1.5 fold, but also included 233 transcripts with 2 to 3-fold effects, 40 transcripts with 3 to 10-fold effects, and 10 transcripts with &#x0003e;10-fold effects (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0001435-t006">Table 6</xref>).

Interestingly, more of these Y chromosome eQTLs exhibited female bias (166) than male bias (133), indicating a Y chromosome effect on decreasing expression of specific transcripts in males. We mapped the genomic distribution of these sex- biased eQTLs, and they basically shared the hotspot distribution that we observed for the overall female and male eQTLs distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001435-g001">Fig 1C, D</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>In the current work, we have identified eQTLs separately from male and female bone marrow derived macrophages derived from F<sub>2</sub> mice from an AKR x DBA/2 strain intercross. These studies are subject to methodological considerations for both the microarray and QTL analyses. We chose to use Microarray Suite 5.0 (Affymetrix) for array normalization and expression levels, as this method has been shown to yield results similar to those obtained using the more conservative RMA normalization procedure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001435-Chesler1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001435-Petretto1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. We also chose not to log transform the gene expression data. Although this will give relatively more weight to the data with large gene expression values, we prefer this over giving equal weight to a doubling of gene expression at the low end of the scale (e.g. 50 vs. 100 arbitrary MAS5 units), where the precision of the measure is expected to be lower and the signal approaches the background level, versus the high end of the scale (e.g. 5,000 vs. 10,000 arbitrary MAS5 units), where the precision of the measure is expected to be higher and the signal is far above the background level. Furthermore, we did not screen the Affymetrix probe sets for SNPs polymorphic between the AKR and DBA/2 strains, but based on a prior screen for polymorphic SNPs between the C57BL/6 and DBA/2 strains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001435-Chesler1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, only a small fraction of the cis eQTLs identified may be artefactual due SNPs in the probe sequence that could alter hybridization to the array. Nevertheless, some of our cis eQTLs could be due to either a polymorphic SNP overlapping the probe sequence, or a polymorphic copy number variation for the probe target sequence; and either of these would be expected to give rise to strong and highly heritable cis eQTLs. For our QTL analysis, we used the suggestive and significant LOD thresholds of 3.0 and 4.3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001435-Lander1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, as used in prior eQTL studies of mouse strain intercrosses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001435-Schadt1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001435-Wang1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>; in addition, we performed permutation analysis to directly calculate genome wide p-values of 0.25 and 0.02, respectively, for these LOD thresholds. These genome wide p-values were the same for cis and trans eQTLs at any given LOD threshold. However, it may be argued that we are underestimating the strength of the cis eQTLs, since the genome wide permutations utilized all markers and all probesets, while only one linked marker needs to be used to test the strength of cis eQTLs. We analyzed all eQTLs in single sex cohorts, as sex has been shown be markedly affect gene expression and eQTLs in various mouse tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001435-Wang1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001435-Yang1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, and this strategy proved particularly important for trans eQTLs which were overwhelmingly sex-specific.</p><p>At the suggestive LOD threshold of 3.0, there were &#x0223c;3 to 4 times more trans eQTLs than cis eQTLs in both sexes. However, the average LOD score for the cis eQTLs was much higher than for trans eQTLs, as previously observed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001435-Schadt1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, presumably due to the direct effect of cis regulation being stronger than the indirect effect of trans regulation. At the significant LOD threshold of 4.3, there were instead more cis eQTLs than trans eQTLs. At this threshold, the vast majority of the cis eQTLs were retained from the suggestive threshold in both sexes, while only &#x0223c;10&#x00025; of the trans eQTLs were retained from the suggestive threshold. This shift from predominantly trans eQTLs at the suggestive threshold to predominantly cis eQTLs at the significant threshold was also observed in an eQTL study of adipose tissue from a mouse strain intercross <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001435-Wang1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The occurrence of eQTLs hotspots resembled prior studies in which eQTL hotspots were found <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001435-Brem1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001435-Schadt1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, the genes responsible for two trans eQTL hotspots have been identified in yeast, and both are signal transduction proteins rather than transcription factors, one is a G-protein subunit of a pheromone receptor, and the other is a protein that inactivates a transcription factor activator <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001435-Yvert1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>.

Further work would be required to confirm whether any of these candidates are in fact responsible for these eQTL super hotspots.</p><p>The third eQTL super hotspot in the males was on the Y chromosome. This is the first report, of which we are aware, of Y chromosome eQTLs. We were able to identify these due to the reciprocal nature of the strain intercross. At the LOD 4.3 threshold there were 334 Y chromosome eQTLs in the male cohort (almost all trans eQTLs), greatly outnumbering the 31 eQTLs on the X chromosome in the males. This indicates that the Y chromosome strain difference had a larger effect on gene expression in male bone marrow derived macrophages than the X chromosome strain difference. There were 171 female eQTLs mapped to the X chromosome at the LOD 4.3 threshold, also outnumbering the 31 male eQTLs mapped to the X chromosome, indicating that strain differences on the X chromosome were more important in regulating gene expression in female than in male macrophages.</p><p>Although the majority of the cis eQTLs at either LOD threshold were conserved between the male and female cohorts, we were surprised by the low level of sharing for the trans eQTLs, with only &#x0223c;1 to 2&#x00025; of female or male trans eQTLs common to both sexes. We considered two possible interpretations of this finding: 1) the sex chromosomes play an enormous role in trans regulation of gene expression; or 2) the majority of trans eQTLs are false positives and therefore not conserved between the sexes. The evidence that supports the first interpretation is: a) the trans eQTLs were identified by the same methods that found the cis eQTLs, which are robustly conserved; and b) our genome wide p-values are based upon permutation analysis which takes into account the data structure, and thus these are likely to be good estimates. However, there is also evidence to support the second interpretation: permuting the sexes did not greatly reduce the number of total trans eQTLs, although it did reduce the trans eQTLs in males by 40&#x00025;. Another group has also found that trans eQTLs are not reproducible, in this case comparing trans eQTLs discovered using an F<sub>2</sub> cohort and a panel of recombinant inbred strains derived from the same two parental strains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001435-Peirce1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, we cannot convincingly conclude at this time that the sex chromosomes are crucial in mediating trans regulation of gene expression, although our data support this concept. Our finding that 31&#x00025; of the expressed genes (&#x0003e;6700 transcripts) had a male or female expression bias (confirmed by permutation analysis) lends support for the role of the sex chromosomes in global gene regulation.</p><p>The large degree of sex bias in gene expression that we detected in macrophages can partly be attributed to the large power we had to detect highly significant sex effects on gene expression even when the absolute effect was small (&#x0003c;20&#x00025; difference) due to the large sample size (93 female and 114 male samples). This magnitude of sex biased gene expression was previously observed in mouse liver, adipose, muscle, and brain in a similar microarray study using a large F<sub>2</sub> cohort <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001435-Yang1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>.

It may be argued that some of the sex bias in gene expression in the prior study of mouse liver, adipose, muscle, and brain could be environmental rather than genetic, due to the different hormonal and metabolic environment in male and female mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001435-Wang1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001435-Yang1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. In contrast, the current study used cells that were grown and differentiated for 2 weeks <italic>ex vivo</italic> prior to RNA preparation, which should increase the genetic component of the sex bias on gene expression by eliminating the differential and fluctuating hormonal environment of the donor mouse. However, we cannot exclude the possibility of long lasting effects of hormones that may alter cell development and thus gene expression profiles.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Mice</title><p>ApoE-deficient mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001435-Plump1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref> on the C57BL/6 genetic background were bred &#x02265;10 generations onto the AKR/J and DBA/2J genetic backgrounds.
