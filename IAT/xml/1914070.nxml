While the canonical mitotic cell division entails the separation of sister chromatids, at the first meiotic division homologous centromeres segregate to opposite poles, followed by a more mitosis-like segregation of sister chromatids at meiosis II &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030113-b001">1</xref>&#x0005d;. To ensure the production of euploid gametes, pairs of homologous chromosomes must therefore successfully perform three tasks: homologous chromosomes must be paired, that pairing must be maintained to hold chromosomes together, and finally the pairing must be dissolved to move homologous centromeres to opposite poles. While the formation of chiasmata through homologous recombination is normally necessary and sufficient to maintain pairing, <italic>Drosophila</italic> can accurately segregate achiasmate chromosomes through the distributive segregation system, and a number of genes are specifically required for segregating nonexchange chromosomes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030113-b002">2</xref>&#x0005d;. In this system, paired blocks of homologous heterochromatin take the place of chiasmata to maintain chromosomal associations until prometaphase &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030113-b003">3</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>All recombination in <italic>Drosophila</italic> is completed during prophase in the first &#x0223c;36 hours of oogenesis. After the synaptonemal complex disassembles at the end of pachytene, the chromosomes remain in prophase for approximately 3&#x02013;4 days. Finally, prometaphase begins in late oogenesis with germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD) followed by chromatin-mediated spindle assembly &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030113-b001">1</xref>&#x0005d;. Mature oocytes then arrest at metaphase I with nonexchange chromosomes balanced separately on opposite sides of the spindle &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030113-b004">4</xref>&#x0005d;. The meiotic spindle then remains arrested at metaphase I until the oocyte passages through the oviduct, a process that can take from 2 hours to several days &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030113-b004">4</xref>&#x0005d;. However, live imaging reveals that in early prometaphase the movement of achiasmate chromosomes is highly dynamic. The two homologs move back and forth along the same arc of the spindle, such that both homologs, while still physically associated, are often positioned on the same half spindle &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030113-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030113-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d;. This presence of physically associated <italic>X</italic> chromosomes on the same side of the spindle during prometaphase was first observed in fixed images from <italic>nod</italic> oocytes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030113-b004">4</xref>&#x0005d;. More recently, it was also documented in <italic>ald</italic> oocytes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030113-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d; and in <italic>FM7/X</italic> wild-type oocytes. This back-and-forth movement of achiasmate bivalents is usually completed within the first several hours after GVBD in these oocytes, after which the nonexchange chromosomes achieve a stable balance on opposite sides of the spindle (S. E. Hughes, J. L. Cottita, and R. S. Hawley, unpublished data).</p><p>In order to understand the mechanism by which meiotic progression is delayed sufficiently to allow the completion of this process, and thus properly partition the achiasmate homologs on opposite half spindles, we have been studying the <named-content content-type="genus-species">Drosophila ald</named-content> gene. Hypomorphic mutations in the <italic>ald</italic> gene cause high levels of achiasmate nondisjunction (NDJ) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030113-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d; and, based on the analysis of fixed images, appear to allow the precocious entry of oocytes into anaphase I &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030113-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d;. <italic>ald</italic> was first identified in a screen for meiotic mutants causing NDJ &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030113-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d;. Although the primary defect observed in <italic>ald</italic> oocytes was in the segregation of nonexchange chromosomes, this mutation had the unusual property of causing exchange chromosomes to nondisjoin at a low rate, as well. Cytological studies of <italic>ald</italic> mutant oocytes revealed a high frequency of chromosomes that appeared to have precociously entered anaphase I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030113-g001">Figure 1</xref>), and in which achiasmate homologs were often seen as still physically associated and thus perhaps &#x0201c;trapped&#x0201d; on one side of the spindle &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030113-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><fig id="pgen-0030113-g001" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title><italic>ald</italic> Mutants and Their Effects</title><p>(A) An oocyte nucleus from a <italic>yw; ald<sup>C3</sup>/ald<sup>Exc23</sup>; pol</italic> female, showing DNA (white) and tubulin (red).

Mps1 is a widely conserved kinase present in most model organisms (except nematodes) and is a key component of the meiotic and mitotic spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030113-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d;. This checkpoint ensures proper alignment of kinetochores on the developing spindle, through monitoring of microtubule attachment, kinetochore tension, or both &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030113-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;, and includes other conserved kinetochore-associated proteins including Bub1, BubR1, Bub3, and Mad2 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030113-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;. Improper alignment results in the inhibition of the anaphase promoting complex, and ultimately the retention of sister chromatid cohesion. Without Mps1 kinase activity, the SAC cannot be activated in the presence of misaligned chromosomes. Therefore, the anaphase promoting complex degrades Securin, which frees Separase to cleave Cohesin, and nuclei spontaneously bypass normal arrest once sister chromatid cohesion is released &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030113-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Based on these observations, one could propose that the meiotic misbehavior observed in fixed images of <italic>ald</italic> oocytes is explained by the entry of these oocytes into anaphase prior to the time required to properly balance achiasmate homologs on opposite sides of the spindle. We show below that this is indeed the case. Visualization of meiosis in <italic>ald</italic> oocytes by live video microscopy revealed that shortly after spindle formation, the DNA failed to remain as a single mass at the metaphase plate, and soon entered an anaphase-like configuration where first the chromosomes and then the spindle appeared to divide into two masses, similar to what is seen in fixed images. This entry into anaphase took less time than achiasmate homologs often require to achieve proper orientation, and was never observed during prometaphase in wild-type oocytes.</p><p>The proper assembly of kinetochores is required for many cellular processes, including the SAC and chromosome attachment to microtubules &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030113-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;. Kinetochore structure has been extensively studied in mitosis, and while it can be roughly broken down into an inner and outer kinetochore plate, this likely is oversimplifying the complexity of a structure that incorporates the &#x0223c;65&#x02013;70 component proteins identified to date in yeast &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030113-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;. While orthologs for all these proteins have not yet been identified in metazoans, the larger kinetochores of these organisms likely contain an equal or greater number of components. The inner centromere includes proteins such as Aurora-B and Incenp &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030113-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;, which are chromosomal passenger complex proteins. Aurora-B and Incenp are required for the incorporation of outer kinetochore proteins, such as those involved in the SAC, and during cell division migrate to the central spindle &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030113-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;. Mps1 protein has been shown to exhibit mitotic kinetochore localization in <italic>Xenopus</italic>, mice, yeast, humans, and flies &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030113-b009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030113-b013">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030113-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;. The kinetochore localization is dynamic, as fluorescence recovery after photobleaching shows the protein cycles rapidly through kinetochores with a half-life of &#x0223c;10 s in yeast &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030113-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;. We show here that Ald also localizes to the outer kinetochore in meiosis I in female <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Curiously, these outer kinetochore structures are sometimes, but not always, highly distended, and in such cases are well-separated from the innermost centromere protein Cid, the centromere-specific histone H3 variant &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030113-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>In addition to its localization to the outer kinetochore, we also observed cytoplasmic filaments containing Ald, which appear to be forming at the same time as GVBD. While these filaments are not observed in mitotic cells, similar filaments were observed by GFP fluorescence in live oocytes bearing a <italic>polo-GFP</italic> transgene. Polo is a protein kinase that is a central regulator of many aspects of cell cycle progression through mitosis and meiosis, including regulation of Cdc25, Scc1, and the anaphase promoting complex (reviewed in &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030113-b019">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030113-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;). Fixed oocytes demonstrate colocalization of Polo-GFP and Ald, confirming that these proteins are present in the same filaments. Examination of Polo-GFP localization in flies also mutant for <italic>ald</italic> demonstrates that Polo-GFP localization to filaments is largely unaffected, indicating that the filaments do not appear to require Ald to form. However, localization of known structural proteins, including actin, tubulin, Anillin, four septins, and two lamins failed to identify any structural protein underlying these filaments. As Ald and Polo are both kinetochore components, localization of other kinetochore-associated proteins found that BubR1 also localized to filaments in a minority of cases. However, localization of the other kinetochore components Bub1, Bub3, Mad2, Incenp, and Aurora-B did not find these proteins associated with these structures.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Live Imaging of Meiosis in <italic>ald</italic> Mutant Oocytes Reveals Early Release into Anaphase</title><p>Live imaging of meiosis in <italic>ald</italic> mutant females confirmed that the loss of the SAC results in premature entry into anaphase. As in wild type, GVBD occurs, and the spindle begins to form around the oocyte nucleus. However, while wild type then proceeds to elongate the spindle while maintaining the chiasmate chromosomes at the metaphase plate, oocytes from <italic>ald</italic> mutant females do not appear to reach a stable metaphase arrest. Instead, as exemplified by individual movie frames in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030113-g002">Figure 2</xref> (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030113-sv001">Video S1</xref> for the full movie), shortly after the spindle forms the chromatin begins to separate into separate masses, as if it were prematurely losing sister chromatid cohesion. This division is not always complete, and can appear aberrant. In some oocytes, the chromatin mass elongates and appears to partially split, but remains connected by thin threads of DNA, or large DNA masses can even move back and forth across the spindle (unpublished data). Frames from these movies resemble figures obtained by studying fixed oocytes from <italic>ald</italic> mutant females &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030113-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d;, suggesting that these results are not artifacts of either fixation or live imaging. This bypass of arrest was not observed in live oocytes bearing <italic>nod</italic> or <italic>mtrm</italic> mutants (unpublished data), indicating that the defect of maintaining metaphase I arrest is not a general feature of mutations that affect nonexchange chromosomes.</p><fig id="pgen-0030113-g002" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title><italic>ald</italic> Mutant Oocytes Fail to Arrest at Metaphase I</title><p>Frames from live imaging of an <italic>FM7/yw; ald<sup>1</sup>/Df(3R)AN6</italic> oocyte nucleus entering anaphase shortly after spindle formation, with no metaphase arrest.

E. Hughes, J. L. Cottita, and R. S. Hawley, unpublished data). Out of six <italic>FM7/X</italic> achiasmate oocytes monitored for at least 45 min, plus an additional four <italic>FM7/X</italic> oocytes monitored for at least 1 h, we never observed a wild-type oocyte bypassing metaphase arrest. This is despite the fact that monitoring of some oocytes began with fully formed spindles. These movies therefore underestimate, potentially by several hours, the time expired since GVBD. Additionally, the longest an <italic>FM7/X</italic> oocyte was observed after imaging began was over 4 h, and it was able to maintain arrest for that duration. Therefore, out of ten wild-type oocytes monitored for at least the time approximately required to properly partition achiasmate chromosomes, none were observed to bypass metaphase arrest. Furthermore, of an additional 40 <italic>FM7/X</italic> and <italic>X/X</italic> wild-type oocytes imaged for shorter durations in various stages of prometaphase, none were observed to have bypassed metaphase arrest.</p><p>As noted above, pairs of nonexchange chromosomes can temporarily reside on the same half of the spindle prior to achieving proper arrest on opposite sides of the spindle. If entry into anaphase occurred before the achiasmate homologs were properly positioned on opposite half spindles, as is suggested by the fixed images in Gilliland et al. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030113-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d;, then both chromosomes would be &#x0201c;trapped&#x0201d; on the same side of the spindle, and would both go to the same pole, resulting in NDJ. This configuration was observed in fixed images, where both autosomes completely separated from their homologs, and the two <italic>X</italic> chromosomes were both present on one side of the spindle (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030113-sg001">Figure S1</xref>). Therefore, the sensitivity of nonexchange chromosomes to the loss of the SAC can be explained by these chromosomes being forced to segregate before proper biorientation can be achieved.</p><p>Different <italic>ald</italic> genotypes can have very different rates of achiasmate NDJ, ranging from a few percent up to completely random segregation &#x0005b;5,6, and our unpublished observations&#x0005d;. The mechanism underlying this range of phenotypes could be due to the more severe genotypes losing sister chromatid cohesion earlier, which would trap more nonexchange chromosomes before completing biorientation. Alternatively, more severe alleles could be more likely to lose cohesion, without affecting the duration of prometaphase. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we imaged meiosis in <italic>FM7/X</italic> oocytes from three different <italic>ald</italic> genotypes. A total of 35 oocytes were imaged from these three genotypes, of which 12 were observed exiting GVBD, and could therefore be used to determine the duration before chromosome separation could be seen. Those oocytes that did not include GVBD could still be assayed to determine if they underwent premature sister chromatid separation.

First, very similar GFP filaments could be observed in live, unfixed oocytes dissected from Polo-GFP females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030113-g006">Figure 6</xref>C). Second, Ald staining filaments were first observed in flies that did not carry Polo-GFP. Finally, a careful examination of figures from a previous study using an anti-Polo antibody in oocytes also reveals filaments of Polo staining &#x0005b;25 and K. McKim, personal communication&#x0005d;. While we have not tested the Ald and Polo antibodies in the same prep, the fact that Polo forms filaments with and without the GFP fusion construct makes it likely to not be artifactual.</p><p>It also appears that these filaments are polymerizing throughout the oocyte cytoplasm concurrently with GVBD. While we have never observed filaments in oocytes that were clearly pre-GVBD, to date we have identified three oocytes that appear to have been fixed in the process of breaking down the germinal vesicle, based on the shape of the karyosome and the &#x0201c;ruffled&#x0201d; appearance of the membrane. In these oocytes (one carrying Polo-GFP and two wild type), the filaments are shorter and more uniform in length than usual (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030113-g007">Figure 7</xref>A). This uniformity suggests that filament formation is triggered by a diffusible signal that is able to transverse the cytoplasm rapidly relative to the rate of filament formation. Furthermore, in these oocytes the filament formation has not extended into the area of the germinal vesicle. We also note that the one wild-type oocyte we have at this stage that was stained with anti-BubR1 antibodies has several notable features in the BubR1 staining. First, while most of the BubR1 staining is found in punctate foci, inside the germinal vesicle the BubR1 staining is still diffuse. This suggests that the same set of changes that result in the Ald/Polo filament formation also moves the BubR1 protein into discrete foci. Furthermore, many (but not all) Ald filaments are associated with BubR1 foci at one or both ends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030113-g007">Figure 7</xref>B).</p><fig id="pgen-0030113-g007" position="float"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>Polo-GFP Filaments Appear to Form at GVBD</title><p>(A) A 60&#x000d7; image of a <italic>polo-GFP</italic> oocyte, apparently fixed in early GVBD.

In that study, the proteins KNL-1, KNL-3, MIS-12, NDC-80, Nuf2<sup>HIM-10</sup>, and BUB-1 were reported to localize to short filaments that appeared only in female meiosis I, and disappeared by meiosis II. We note that there are several qualitative differences between those filaments and the ones highlighted by our antibody, most significantly that the worm filaments are associated with the egg cortex and spindle while the fly filaments were found throughout the oocyte cytoplasm and did not appear to associate with the spindle at all. To determine if the fly filaments were also dispersing by meiosis II, we examined live zygotes from Polo-GFP mothers at 9&#x02013;15 min post-oviposition (mean time 11.9 min).

We found no cases (0/23 zygotes) where GFP filaments could be observed, which is consistent with the filaments disassembling by meiosis II. As a control, after egg collection was finished, egg-laying females were dissected and their oocytes visualized, which confirmed that filaments could be seen in pre-activation oocytes.</p><p>Identifying proteins in common to the filaments in both species is difficult, as there is no <italic>mps1</italic> ortholog in <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. elegans</named-content>, and to the best of our knowledge Polo has not been localized in oocytes in that species.

Interestingly, the localization of both Aurora-B and Incenp proteins changed from early prometaphase to metaphase arrest. In early prometaphase, Incenp was found at kinetochores (closer to the DNA than Ald) as well as patchily distributed throughout the spindle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030113-g008">Figure 8</xref>A). By metaphase arrest, the kinetochore association is lost, and the protein is found broadly distributed along the middle of the spindle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030113-g008">Figure 8</xref>B). Similarly, Aurora-B associated weakly with kinetochores and the outer edge of the spindle in early prometaphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030113-g008">Figure 8</xref>C), then along the metaphase plate in mid-prometaphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030113-g008">Figure 8</xref>D).

For both proteins, Ald kinetochore localization persisted after Aurora-B/Incenp was no longer found at kinetochores.

In our hands, the Bub1, Bub3, and Mad2 antibodies did not localize to the meiotic spindle or the prometaphase kinetochore. That this was not simply antibody failure could be seen by localization to other structures, such as Bub1 staining present inside the germinal vesicle before breakdown, or Mad2 localizing to follicle cell nuclei surrounding the oocyte (unpublished data). BubR1 did localize to kinetochores in 21&#x00025; (6/29) of oocytes, but also localized to the surface of the chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030113-g008">Figure 8</xref>F).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3a"><title>The Role of the SAC in Facilitating the Proper Co-orientation of Achiasmate Bivalents</title><p>The progression of meiosis is a tightly temporally regulated event &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030113-b029">29</xref>&#x0005d; and the study of cell cycle regulation is greatly enhanced by being able to visualize meiosis in living cells. In our study, a defect in a kinetochore component results in the precocious entry into anaphase, presumably as a result of the early activation of Separase, as well as the mis-segregation of nonexchange chromosomes. We explain the greater sensitivity of nonexchange chromosomes to <italic>ald</italic> mutants by noting that while chiasmate chromosomes appear to co-orient immediately upon GVBD, nonexchange chromosomes require more time to achieve proper biorientation. The test of this hypothesis lies in the relative timing of these two events, data which are straightforwardly obtained from live imaging but difficult, and considerably more ambiguous, to obtain only from the examination of fixed images.</p><p>As we have observed, <italic>ald</italic> mutant oocytes can enter an anaphase-like configuration practically as soon as the spindle is formed, so we believe that this requirement is satisfied. This interpretation is strengthened by the three genotypes we examined by live imaging. For the two genotypes with the highest rates of NDJ <italic>(ald<sup>1</sup>/Df(3R)AN6</italic> and <italic>ald<sup>Exc23</sup>/Df(3R)AN6),</italic> every oocyte examined appeared to undergo premature separation, while the weakest genotype (<italic>ald<sup>1</sup>/ald<sup>1</sup>)</italic> only lost cohesion in 43&#x00025; of oocytes. This is consistent with the NDJ data, as homologs segregating at random are expected to nondisjoin half of the time, and so if the failure to maintain sister chromatid cohesion is the cause of the NDJ, it should occur at approximately twice the rate of NDJ. While the duration of prometaphase did not correlate with the propensity to nondisjoin, this may reflect a difference between the alleles. The <italic>ald<sup>1</sup></italic> oocytes contain only hypomorphic protein, while the <italic>ald<sup>Exc23</sup></italic> oocytes still contain a small amount of wild-type protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030113-g005">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p>We furthermore note that strong <italic>ald</italic> alleles also induce chiasmate NDJ at high levels, a fact underscored by the mutant screen that recovered <italic>ald<sup>C3</sup></italic> (S. L. Page and R. S. Hawley, unpublished data). This germline clone screen only recovered mutants that could cause a chiasmate autosome to nondisjoin, and <italic>ald</italic> was the most commonly hit gene, with four out of 12 recovered mutants containing new alleles of <italic>ald</italic>. The mechanism cannot be the same as that for nonexchange chromosomes, as chiasmate chromosomes appear to be properly co-oriented after GVBD, without the back-and-forth movement observed for <italic>FM7/X</italic>. One possibility is that the loss of sister chromatid cohesion when the SAC is impaired causes all chiasmata to resolve during early prometaphase. This would result in a situation analogous to mutants such as <italic>meiW68,</italic> the <italic>Drosophila</italic> homolog of <italic>spo11,</italic> where recombination has been completely abolished, which also cause high levels of NDJ &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030113-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d;.

It was surprising that in some, but not all, cases, the kinetochore staining of Ald clearly extended well outside the centromere region identified by Cid. One possibility is that the very rapid cycling of Ald through the kinetochore &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030113-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d; proceeds by transport of the protein along attached microtubules. If this is the case, the extended kinetochores highlighted by Ald staining represent protein that has been released from the kinetochore but has not yet detached from the microtubule. Alternatively, the finding of such kinetochores evokes the model of stretched centromeric DNA observed during mitosis using the LacO/LacI-GFP system in budding yeast &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030113-b033">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030113-b036">36</xref>&#x0005d;. For example, He et al. found that LacO arrays inserted closer than 9 kb away from the centromere were found to transiently separate from their homolog by up to 0.8 &#x003bc;m during metaphase, while arrays inserted 13 kb or further away from the centromere were separated by only 0.3 &#x003bc;m &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030113-b033">33</xref>&#x0005d;. They interpreted this finding as indicating the centromere-proximal chromatin was being stretched, possibly as part of how the kinetochore senses tension. In light of this finding, an alternative interpretation of our extended Ald staining result is that tension on a kinetochore is able to change its shape, and therefore the cytology may reflect the SAC being in an on or off configuration. As checkpoint signaling requires the kinase activity of Mps1 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030113-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;, finding this protein along the extended kinetochore structure means it is well positioned to perform this role.</p><p>However, we must note that we observed neither DAPI fluorescence nor Cid localization to these extended kinetochores, and cannot prove that there is DNA present in these structures. It may be that the structure highlighted by extended Ald staining was composed solely of proteins, and represents a kinetochore that is structurally different from the mitotic kinetochore. The <italic>Drosophila</italic> female meiotic kinetochore has not previously been examined by electron microscopy, and given the lack of centrosomes, the female meiotic kinetochore may have important structural differences as well. If this is the case, then the <italic>Drosophila</italic> ovary should prove well suited to the study of this kinetochore. In addition to the possibility of monitoring the relative positioning of different proteins on the spindle via immunofluorescence, the well-established use of germline clones would allow for studying the effects on meiosis of mutations in genes that would be lethal during development &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030113-b037">37</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>We also note that our localization of Aurora-B and Incenp is different from what was previously reported in mitosis. In mitosis, Aurora-B is a chromosomal passenger protein that is essential to the function of the SAC, and migrates from the kinetochore to the spindle midzone at the metaphase/anaphase transition &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030113-b038">38</xref>&#x0005d;. Here, we show that in female meiosis, this migration happens early in prometaphase, prior to checkpoint inactivation, and localizes to either the midzone (for Incenp) or to a stripe along only one side of the spindle (for Aurora-B). That these two proteins form a different final configuration shows they are no longer present in the same complex at metaphase arrest. We also note that our localization is slightly different from that previously reported by Jang et al. in <italic>Drosophila</italic> oocytes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030113-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d;. In that study, they were unable to find localization of Aurora-B and Incenp to the kinetochore during prometaphase, and they did not see a stripe of Aurora-B staining. We found kinetochore localization only during the very earliest stages of prometaphase, before the <italic>4</italic> chromosomes have begun moving out from the main chromosomal mass, which was an earlier stage than the images presented in their paper. Also, our study used achiasmate <italic>FM7/X</italic> oocytes, while Jang et al. used chiasmate <italic>X/X</italic> oocytes. That the Aurora-B stripe at metaphase arrest appeared along the side of the oocyte that the nonexchange <italic>X</italic> chromosomes were associated with suggests that this is a feature of achiasmate chromosomes, and may be why Jang et al. did not observe it. It also suggests that Aurora-B may play a role in balancing nonexchange homologs on the meiotic spindle.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Filaments of Outer Kinetochore Kinases in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Oocyte</title><p>Finally, the identification of Ald-containing filaments represents a novel structure in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> oocyte, as well as a novel functionality for both Ald and Polo kinases. That these filaments could be found in fixed and unfixed <italic>polo-GFP</italic> oocytes, as well as fixed wild-type oocytes, indicates that they are neither an artifact of fixation nor of the GFP construct. While both Polo and Ald are kinetochore-associated proteins, of the other kinetochore-associated proteins we examined (Cid, Aurora-B, Incenp, Bub1, BubR1, Bub3, and Mad2), only BubR1 localized to a minority of filaments.</p><p>The filaments appear to be sequestering Ald protein, but do not require Ald for their formation. This is clearly indicated by the <italic>Polo-GFP/&#x0002b;; ald<sup>Exc23</sup></italic> oocytes, in which filaments were barely detectable by Ald staining, but appeared unaffected when visualized by Polo-GFP staining. Therefore, we conclude that the reduction of filaments in the various mutant backgrounds must be due to a failure to detect the filaments, even though the filaments are still present. The occasional filament seen in some images confirms this interpretation, as only those filaments that incorporated enough Ald protein over a small region would be classified as a linear structure. Doing the reciprocal experiment of staining for Ald in the presence of a Polo mutant cannot be done due to the sterility of those mutants, but may be possible to conduct through the use of germline clones. Interestingly, the <italic>ald<sup>1</sup></italic> hemizygotes had fewer filaments than <italic>ald<sup>&#x0002b;</sup></italic> hemizygotes despite having similar levels of protein. One possibility is that the <italic>ald<sup>1</sup></italic> allele cannot be sequestered as efficiently as <italic>ald<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>.</italic> As Mps1 is phosphorylated during checkpoint activation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030113-b039">39</xref>&#x0005d;, one possibility is that the <italic>ald<sup>1</sup></italic> mutation disrupts a phosphorylation site. Indeed, there is an in silico-predicted phosphorylation site that is disrupted in the <italic>ald<sup>1</sup></italic> mutant for the threonine-9 codon (NetPhos 2.0 score, <italic>ald<sup>&#x0002b;</sup></italic>: 0.752, <italic>ald<sup>1</sup></italic>: 0.314.) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030113-b040">40</xref>&#x0005d;, which suggests that phosphorylation may be involved in regulating the incorporation of Ald into these filaments.</p><p>We are also interested in how these filaments are formed. We propose that the polymerization is triggered by a signal propagating through the oocyte, and that this signal occurs during germinal vesicle breakdown. However, what that signal is, and what the targets of that signal are, remain to be determined. It is also unclear whether the formation of filaments is necessary for the initiation of GVBD, or a downstream consequence of it. The presence of BubR1 foci at the tips of many of the filaments as they are forming also suggests that other proteins are involved in their construction; we note that BubR1 was the only protein (besides Ald and Polo) to incorporate into the filaments at all. A further question, as these filaments appear to disassemble by meiosis II, is what signal initiates the disassembly, and what proteins are required to respond to that signal. Finally, the function of these filaments is unknown. While we have no direct evidence for the function of these filaments, several possibilities suggest themselves. One possibility is that, because many SAC proteins (including Mps1 and Polo) are degraded as part of checkpoint inactivation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030113-b039">39</xref>&#x0005d;, the filaments may protect the maternal load of these proteins during this stage. However, this interpretation is not consistent with the filaments dispersing by meiosis II, as the proteins would still be susceptible to degradation during the syncytial nuclear divisions. Another possibility is that the filaments allow the cell to regulate the activity of these proteins during meiosis I. One approach to answer these questions would use immunoprecipitation to isolate these filaments and determine what other proteins are present, followed by examination of mutant alleles of those component proteins. The mechanism that these filaments carry out could likely be inferred by the meiotic defects of mutants in other genes involved in filament formation.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>For live imaging of DNA and tubulin, oocytes from females aged 3&#x02013;5 d in yeasted bottles with males were dissected, injected with rhodamine-tubulin (Cytoskeleton, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cytoskeleton.com">http://www.cytoskeleton.com</ext-link>) and Oli-Green DNA dye (Molecular Probes, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.invitrogen.com">http://www.invitrogen.com</ext-link>), and imaged as described (S.
