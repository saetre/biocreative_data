Over the past few years, it has emerged that cytosolic mRNAs are in a dynamic equilibrium between different functional and subcellular locations. Translating mRNAs can be found in polysomes, whereas nontranslating mRNAs often accumulate in either stress granules or P bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson and Kedersha, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Eulalio et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Parker and Sheth, 2007</xref>).</p><p>Stress granules have been primarily studied in mammalian cells and are dynamic aggregates of untranslating mRNAs in conjunction with a subset of translation initiation factors (eIF4E, eIF4G, eIF4A, eIF3, and eIF2), the 40S ribosomal subunit, and the poly(A) binding protein (Pabp; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson and Kedersha, 2006</xref>). Notable RNA binding proteins in stress granules include TIA-R, TIA-1, and G3BP, with the latter two possessing self-interaction domains that aid stress granule formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tourriere et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gilks et al., 2004</xref>). Stress granules are generally not present in normal cells and form in response to defects in translation initiation, including decreased function of eIF2 or eIF4A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kedersha et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mazroui et al., 2006</xref>). Because stress responses often involve a transient inhibition of translation initiation, stress granules accumulate during many stress responses.</p><p>P bodies are RNA protein granules containing untranslating mRNAs complexed with a set of translation repressors, the mRNA decapping machinery and the 5&#x02032;&#x02013;3&#x02032; exonuclease Xrn1. P bodies are conserved structures present in yeast, plants, nematodes, flies, and mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson and Kedersha, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Eulalio et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Parker and Sheth, 2007</xref>). P bodies have been functionally implicated in mRNA decapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sheth and Parker, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cougot et al., 2004</xref>), nonsense-mediated decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Unterholzner and Izaurralde, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sheth and Parker, 2006</xref>), mRNA storage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brengues et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bhattacharyya et al., 2006</xref>), general translation repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Holmes et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Coller and Parker, 2005</xref>), microRNA-mediated repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jakymiw et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pillai et al., 2005</xref>) and viral life-cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beliakova-Bethell et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beckham et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>P bodies and stress granules in mammalian cells dock and undock from one another in a dynamic manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kedersha et al., 2005</xref>), suggesting that mRNPs are exchanged between P bodies and stress granules. One possibility is that mRNAs exiting translation accumulate in stress granules, where they are sorted either to return to translation, or are sent to P bodies for mRNA decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kedersha et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anderson and Kedersha, 2008</xref>). Alternatively, mRNAs exiting translation may first enter P bodies, and undergo a similar sorting process resulting in either mRNA decay, storage in a translationally silenced state, or a return to translation via a stress granule mRNP state. Given the existence of P bodies and stress granules as discrete, interacting cytoplasmic compartments containing nontranslating mRNA, determining the mechanisms by which these particles assemble and interact is important for understanding how cells regulate cytosolic mRNAs.</p><p>An ideal system for studying the relationship between stress granules and P bodies is yeast, as P-body assembly can be prevented or modified in various mutant strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Coller and Parker, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Decker et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Teixeira and Parker, 2007</xref>). Recently, RNP granules containing eIF4E, eIF4G, and Pab1p, which are components of mammalian stress granules, have been described to form in yeast during glucose deprivation and to both overlap or be distinct from P bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brengues and Parker, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hoyle et al., 2007</xref>). Moreover, these granules, referred to as EGP bodies, contain mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hoyle et al., 2007</xref>). In this work, we first demonstrate that by composition and assembly mechanisms, these eIF4E-, eIF4G-, and Pab1-containing granules are analogous to mammalian stress granules. More importantly, genetic and kinetic data indicate that stress granule assembly depends upon P-body formation, whereas P bodies form independently of stress granules. Our data suggest that formation of a P-body mRNP state is the key first step in deciding the fate of mRNAs after exit from polysomes during stress, and imply that stress granules represent sites of translation reinitiation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Yeast contain a distinct RNA granule with composition similar to mammalian stress granules</title><p>An unresolved issue is whether the eIF4E-, eIF4G-, and Pab1p-containing granules observed in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> are analogous to mammalian stress. To determine this, we examined if they contained orthologues of additional mammalian proteins known to accumulate in stress granules using strains bearing a chromosomal C-terminal GFP fusion at the ORF of interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huh et al., 2003</xref>). Besides accepted yeast orthologues of mammalian stress granule proteins, other proteins were examined based on BLAST homology to other mammalian stress granule proteins (e.g., HuR and G3BP), or protein/genetic interaction data, where interactions with eIF4F factors, Pub1, Pbp1, and Ngr1 were given particular consideration. Each protein that formed foci was also examined for its localization to P bodies when coexpressing an Edc3-mCh or Dcp2-RFP fusion protein (unpublished data).</p><p>These experiments revealed that during glucose deprivation the yeast orthologues of many proteins seen in mammalian stress granules accumulate in cytoplasmic foci, which can be distinct from P bodies (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). These included the translation initiation factors eIF4GI, eIF4GII, eIF4E, and Pab1, Pub1, and Ngr1, which are the yeast orthologues of mammalian TIA-1 and TIA-R, and Pbp1, which is the orthologue of Ataxin-2, a component of mammalian stress granules required for their assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nonhoff et al., 2007</xref>; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Several other proteins also accumulate in these foci (Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200807043/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200807043/DC1</ext-link>), including Hrp1 and Gbp2, which are nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling proteins; Nrp1 and Ygr250c, predicted RNA binding proteins; and Eap1, an eIF4E binding protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cosentino et al., 2000</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Candidate yeast stress granule proteins form P body&#x02013;distinct cytoplasmic foci during glucose deprivation.</bold> Log-phase wild-type cells expressing chromosomal GFP-tagged proteins and Edc3-mCh (pRP1574) were glucose deprived and examined. No GFP foci, and only faint P bodies were observed in &#x0002b;glucose control conditions, hence display of merge only.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jcb1830441f01"></graphic></fig><p>To determine if all these proteins were components of a single granule type, we examined their colocalization with a Pub1-mCh fusion protein. We observed that Pub1-mCh colocalized almost completely with GFP fusions of Pab1, eIF4GI, eIF4GII, eIF4E, Pbp1, Ngr1, Eap1, Hrp1, Ygr250c, Gbp2, and Nrp1 (Fig. S2, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200807043/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200807043/DC1</ext-link>). This colocalization indicates that all these proteins are components of a single granule with a similar composition to mammalian stress granules. We refer to these granules as yeast stress granules and note that they are almost certainly the same RNP granules identified earlier as EGP bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brengues and Parker, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hoyle et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to results with mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson and Kedersha, 2006</xref>), yeast stress granules did not contain the Prt1 subunit of eIF3 (unpublished data) or the &#x003b1;-subunit of eIF2, the latter of which forms distinct rod-shaped foci during glucose deprivation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Campbell et al., 2005</xref>). This suggests that the multiple different types of mRNPs can accumulate to form stress granule&#x02013;like RNPs under different conditions and in different organisms. Because stress granules are dynamic assemblies of mRNPs, this implies that the specific composition observed in the granule will depend on which step in a given mRNP transition process is rate limiting, which may change under differing cellular conditions (see Discussion). Additionally, mammalian P bodies often appear docked on the periphery of stress granules, whereas in yeast, when colocalization between P-body and stress granule components occurred, the overlap was more complete.</p><p>We also noted that the translation termination factors eRF1 and eRF3 accumulated in P bodies in a subset of cells, although the majority of these proteins remain cytoplasmic (Fig. S1). This is in agreement with the finding that eRF3 localizes in P bodies during stationary phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dori and Choder, 2007</xref>), and suggests that translation termination may be coupled to assembly of P-body mRNPs.</p></sec><sec><title>Properties of yeast stress granules</title><p>Additional experiments revealed several properties of yeast stress granules. First, as in mammalian cells, the assembly of yeast stress granules is blocked by trapping mRNAs in polysomes with cycloheximide (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>), arguing that yeast stress granules require nontranslating mRNA for assembly, which is also supported by the fact that these granules contain mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hoyle et al., 2007</xref>). Second, unlike mammalian cells, we observed that several other stresses including oxidative stress (3 mM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for 15 min), hypo-osmotic stress (incubation in H<sub>2</sub>O &#x0002b; dextrose), and hyper-osmotic stress (incubation in 1 M KCL &#x0002b; dextrose) had little or no effect on the induction of yeast stress granules, although all of these stresses increased P bodies to varying degrees (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>). This suggests that most stresses in yeast that decrease translation generally lead to the accumulation of mRNAs in P bodies.</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Yeast stress granules are sensitive to cycloheximide, and stimulated by a constitutively active allele of the GCN2 kinase.</bold> (A) Log-phase yRP840 cells transformed with pRP1659 were glucose deprived and examined. Cycloheximide-treated cells (100 &#x003bc;g/ml) were preincubated with the drug for 1 min before harvest. (B) Cells identical to those in A were subject to the following stresses. Oxidative stress: shift to SC media containing 3 mM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> or a mock treatment (H<sub>2</sub>O) for 15 min. Hyperosmotic stress: shift to SC media containing 1 M KCL for 15 min. Hypotonic stress: shift to H<sub>2</sub>O containing 2% dextrose for 15 min. SC media was used as a mock osmotic control. (C) Cells similar to those in A, but additionally transformed with either pRP1663 (Gcn2c) or pRS416 (empty vector control) were glucose deprived and examined for altered stress granule/P-body assembly.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jcb1830441f02"></graphic></fig><p>We also examined the effect upon stress granule formation in yeast of expressing a constitutively active allele of the Gcn2 kinase (Gcn2c; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ramirez et al., 1992</xref>), which phosphorylates and decreases eIF2&#x003b1; function. The logic of this experiment was that in mammalian cells, stress granule assembly is often stimulated by phosphorylation of eIF2&#x003b1; at position Ser51 by stress-inducible kinases such as Gcn2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kedersha et al., 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">2002</xref>). This phosphorylation leads to decreased translation initiation rates, causing accumulation of nontranslating mRNAs in stress granules. We observed that Gcn2c expression in mid-log cultures slightly increased P-body size and brightness over the vector control, and occasional stress granules were visible, though these almost always localized with P bodies (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>; Table S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200807043/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200807043/DC1</ext-link>). More strikingly, in the presence of Gcn2c, both stress granules and P bodies were strongly enhanced during glucose deprivation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>), with stress granules being brighter, larger, and more frequent in cells compared with those expressing an empty vector control. This suggests that, as in mammalian cells, accumulation of mRNAs stalled in translation initiation due to decreased eIF2 function leads to increased formation of stress granules.</p></sec><sec><title>Specific proteins affect yeast stress granule assembly</title><p>To determine how yeast stress granules assemble, we examined how the absence of specific proteins affected the assembly of either stress granules during glucose deprivation (monitored using Pab1-GFP or Pub1-mCh) or P bodies (monitored with Edc3-mCh). An initial set of null strains were chosen based on homology to factors reported to affect mammalian stress granule assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kedersha et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nonhoff et al., 2007</xref>). We then quantified the effects of specific mutations on stress granules by blind scoring of the percentage of cells with stress granules, the average number of granules per cell, and the average size of stress granule foci (see Materials and methods, and Table S1). In these experiments, the absence of stress granules was not due to large changes in expression of the marker protein as verified by Western blot analysis or overall fluorescence levels (Fig. S3 [available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200807043/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200807043/DC1</ext-link>] and unpublished data). These experiments revealed the following important points.</p><p>First, we observed that <italic>pbp1&#x00394;</italic> strains showed a strong reduction in stress granule formation as judged by both the number of cells exhibiting Pab1 and Pub1 foci, and the average number of foci observed, although P bodies still formed at wild-type levels (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>; and see <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). This is consistent with studies of the mammalian orthologue Ataxin-2, where siRNA depletion of the protein leads to reduction in stress granules, but has no effect on P-body formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nonhoff et al., 2007</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig3"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>Mutations that inhibit stress granule assembly do not significantly affect P-body assembly.</bold> Log-phase BY4741 wild-type and isogenic knockout strains were transformed with pRP1657, glucose deprived, and examined for altered stress granule/P-body assembly. Numbers indicate average foci number per cell, and percentage of cells with foci.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jcb1830441f03"></graphic></fig><p>Second, we observed that <italic>pub1&#x00394;</italic> strains also displayed a strong decrease in the average number and percentage of cells with stress granules as judged by Pab1 localization, but with little effect on P bodies. Pub1 is the yeast homologue of TIA-1, which is thought to self-aggregate and promote stress granule assembly by virtue of a glutamine-rich prion domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kedersha et al., 1999</xref>), which is conserved in Pub1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Michelitsch and Weissman, 2000</xref>). In contrast, strains lacking the yeast orthologue of TIA-R, Ngr1, did not show a defect in stress granule formation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>), consistent with prior observations in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gilks et al., 2004</xref>). The similar role in stress granule assembly for Pbp1, Pub1, and their orthologues in mammalian cells strongly argues that yeast and mammalian stress granules are related structures.</p><p>Third, we observed that strains with decreased levels of eIF4G showed decreases in the amount of stress granules formed, again with no clear defects in P-body formation. Yeast has two genes for eIF4G. Strains lacking eIF4GII showed a strong decrease in stress granules as judged by both Pab1p and Pub1, although the degree of inhibition was not as severe as that of either <italic>pbp1&#x00394;</italic> or <italic>pub1&#x00394;</italic> strains (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, and see <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). In contrast, strains lacking eIF4GI showed a strong reduction in stress granules as judged by Pab1p (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>), but had no effect on Pub1 foci (see <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). These results indicate that both eIF4G1 and eIF4GII can affect the assembly of stress granules and that the recruitment of Pub1p into stress granules is differentially affected by the different eIF4G paralogues. Interestingly, although P bodies increase with defects in certain initiation factor mutants (ts alleles of eIF4E, eIF3, and <italic>pab1&#x00394;</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Teixeira et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brengues and Parker 2007</xref>), we did not observe an increase in P bodies with <italic>eIF4GI&#x00394;</italic> or <italic>eIF4GII&#x00394;</italic> strains, which may reflect redundancy between these paralogues, or as-yet unappreciated roles for specific initiation factors in mRNP transitions between P bodies and stress granules.</p><p>These results identify Pub1, Pbp1, and eIF4G proteins as playing important roles in the assembly of yeast stress granules, while also critically demonstrating that yeast P bodies can form independently of stress granules.</p></sec><sec><title>Stress granule formation is not required for translation repression or mRNA stabilization</title><p>Stress granule formation occurs during stresses that lead to a reduction in translation initiation rates, and it has been proposed that the formation of the stress granules might play a role in such translation repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kedersha and Anderson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anderson and Kedersha, 2008</xref>).

Thus, stress granule assembly is unlikely to function in protecting mRNAs from premature or aberrant decay.</p></sec><sec><title>Yeast stress granule formation is dependent on P-body assembly</title><p>An unresolved issue is the nature of interactions between stress granules and P bodies. During translation repression, mRNAs may be initially routed to stress granules, in which mRNAs are either retained in storage before reentry into translation, or are instead sent to P bodies for decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson and Kedersha 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">2008</xref>). An alternative possibility is that mRNAs exiting translation first assemble into an mRNP that can accumulate in P bodies, followed either by degradation, retention for storage, or reentry into translation, which might lead to the formation of stress granules when steps in translation initiation are inhibited. As discussed above, the observation that P bodies can form in the absence of stress granules argues that both P bodies and stress granules form independently, or that P bodies are precursors to stress granules. To distinguish these two possibilities, we examined how defects in P-body assembly affected stress granule formation by taking advantage of mutant strains that inhibit P-body formation by limiting aggregation of mRNPs into larger P bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Coller and Parker, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Decker et al., 2007</xref>). All images were quantified in a blind manner for the effects of each mutation on the percentage of cells with stress granules or P bodies, as well as average foci size and the average number of each foci per cell (see Materials and methods and Table S1).</p><p>To examine possible effects of P-body formation of stress granules, we first examined the effects of deletions of Edc3, which affects P-body aggregation, or the C-terminal tail of Lsm4, which has a prion-type domain that contributes to aggregation of P bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Decker et al., 2007</xref>). In addition, we examined the effects of an <italic>edc3&#x00394; lsm4&#x00394;c</italic> double mutant where P bodies are dramatically reduced. An important result was that <italic>edc3</italic>&#x00394; <italic>lsm4</italic>&#x00394;<italic>c</italic> yeast, which are greatly reduced in P-body formation, were similarly strongly inhibited for formation of stress granules as judged by Pab1-GFP (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 A</xref>) or Pub1-mCh (see <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). Occasional Pab1 or Pub1 foci were seen in a small fraction of cells, but they were fainter, smaller (Table S1), and at least in the case of Pab1, typically colocalized with what faint P bodies remained visible (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 A</xref>). The <italic>edc3&#x00394;</italic> and <italic>lsm4&#x00394;c</italic> strains also showed reductions in stress granule formation, but similar to their partial effects on P-body formation, stress granules were reduced but could still form in <italic>edc3&#x00394;</italic> and <italic>lsm4&#x00394;c</italic> strains (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 A</xref>).

We hypothesized that an <italic>edc3&#x00394; pat1&#x00394;</italic> strain might be extremely defective in P-body formation because it would (1) lack Edc3; (2) lack Pat1, which can contribute to the formation of P bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Teixeira and Parker, 2007</xref>); and (3) would be unable to use the Lsm4 C-terminal domain to assemble P bodies because the recruitment of the Lsm1-7p complex to P bodies is dependent on Pat1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Teixeira and Parker, 2007</xref>). Indeed, examination of an <italic>edc3&#x00394; pat1&#x00394;</italic> strain showed an even stronger block to P-body formation than the <italic>edc3&#x00394; lsm4&#x00394;c</italic> strain, although a few cells could still form small and faint P bodies (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 A</xref>).

One simple interpretation of these observations is that mRNAs move from P bodies to stress granules during transitions between different mRNP complexes, and that the formation of stress granules is facilitated by a preexisting pool of untranslating mRNPs in P bodies (see Discussion).</p><p>A prediction of stress granules forming from mRNAs in P bodies is that strains with enlarged P bodies should show enhanced assembly of stress granules.

One explanation for this may be that under nonstress conditions, Pub1 is removed from mRNAs in P bodies as the mRNA is degraded.</p></sec><sec><title>Temporal analysis indicates stress granules first form in conjunction with P bodies</title><p>The dependence of stress granule assembly on P-body formation suggests that stress granules may form by mRNPs in P bodies exchanging proteins to form an mRNP poised to reenter translation. This model makes two predictions. First, it predicts that stress granules would form after P bodies during stress responses. Second, it predicts that the components of stress granules would first associate with mRNPs in P bodies, followed by maturation of such a complex into a stress granule, as the translation repression/decapping complex was exchanged for translation factors. To test these predictions, we followed the formation of yeast stress granules and P bodies during glucose deprivation by time-lapse microscopy using Pab1-GFP as a marker of stress granules and Dcp2-mCh or Edc3-mCh as a marker of P bodies.</p><p>We observed that from 0&#x02013;7 min after the onset of glucose deprivation stress, P bodies were strongly induced whereas stress granules, as judged by Pab1-GFP, were predominantly absent.

As time progressed, Pab1-GFP foci became brighter within P bodies and then started to form additional cytoplasmic foci which were separate from bright preexisting P bodies.

Additionally, P bodies that become enriched with Pab1 often showed a partially decreased signal for Dcp2-mCh or Edc3-mCh over time, whereas the Pab1 signal maintains or intensifies, suggesting some type of maturation process is indeed occurring.

To examine the relationship between stress granule formation and P bodies in mammalian cells, we examined a time course of stress granule and P-body formation in HeLa cells after arsenite stress using Pabp and Rck (Dhh1 homologue) as markers of stress granules and P bodies, respectively. Similar to yeast cells, we observed that after arsenite stress in HeLa cells, P bodies first increase in number, size, and intensity within 10 min, with no initial change in Pabp distribution (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 A</xref>). However, in contrast to the strong colocalization of Pab1-GFP and P-body foci when stress granules are first forming in yeast, stress granules in mammalian cells primarily first appear as small foci distinct from P bodies, although occasional colocalization of Pabp and Rck was seen. At later time points, &#x0201c;classical&#x0201d; morphology stress granules appear that are usually docked to P bodies (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 A</xref>, &#x0201c;45 min&#x0201d;). These results suggest that stress granules in mammalian cells may form independently of P bodies, or that the biochemical activity of P bodies that enhances stress granule formation may be present in multiple small P bodies throughout the cytosol in mammalian cells (see Discussion).</p><fig position="float" id="fig8"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><p><bold>Temporal analysis of arsenite-stressed HeLa cells reveals P bodies increase in size and number before formation of stress granules.</bold> (A) HeLa cells were fixed at several time points after arsenite stress, from 0 (no arsenite added) to 60 min.

Although speculative, one possibility is that Rck may associate with mRNAs in P bodies and then play a role in those mRNAs transitioning into stress granules, perhaps as an intermediate in an mRNP remodeling process.

Moreover, these granules contain many proteins analogous to those seen in mammalian stress granules including Pub1, Ngr1, and Pbp1, orthologues of the mammalian stress granule proteins TIA-1, TIA-R, and Ataxin-2 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>).

Formally, the individual proteins within P bodies that affect stress granule formation may have separate roles in stress granule formation, although this is unlikely as many of these P-body proteins (e.g., Edc3, Lsm4, and Pat1) are not observed in stress granules. Furthermore, whenever occasional faint stress granules were detected in P body&#x02013;deficient strains, they usually colocalized with the residual faint P bodies, reinforcing the dependency of stress granule formation on P bodies (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). In addition, during inhibition of translation by glucose deprivation, P bodies form first, followed by accumulation of Pab1 in association with P bodies, with independent stress granules appearing last (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). This order of events was also observed in a parallel study, where eIF4E rather than Pab1 was used as a marker of EGP bodies, which are equivalent to yeast stress granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hoyle et al., 2007</xref>). We interpret these observations to indicate that preexisting P bodies enhance the formation of yeast stress granules.</p></sec><sec><title>mRNPs in stress granules may primarily arrive via P bodies</title><p>A simple explanation for the role of P bodies in promoting stress granule formation is that mRNAs exiting translation first enter P bodies, and then subsequently transition to a stress granule state before reentering translation (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>). This model explains both why stress granules form in proximity to P bodies, and why P bodies would enhance the formation of stress granules. A predominant directionality of mRNAs moving from P bodies into stress granules and then onto translation is also consistent with observations that <italic>PGK1</italic> mRNAs are detected in P bodies after 10 min of glucose deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Teixeira et al., 2005</xref>), and in EGP bodies (stress granules) after 30 min of glucose deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hoyle et al., 2007</xref>). Additionally, mRNAs in yeast P bodies can return to translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brengues et al., 2005</xref>), and components of P bodies function as translation repressors, and can be required for translation repression during glucose deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Holmes et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Coller and Parker, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pilkington and Parker, 2008</xref>). Moreover, we observe that translation termination factors can associate with P bodies and not stress granules (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>), which is consistent with the mRNPs in P bodies representing those that have just exited translation and those in stress granules being those preparing to reenter translation. We interpret these observations to argue that most yeast mRNAs move from P bodies to stress granules, although we cannot rule out that some mRNAs, depending on cellular context or transcript-specific factors, may move from translation directly to stress granules, or from stress granules to P bodies.</p><fig position="float" id="fig9"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><p><bold>Model for predominant cytoplasmic flow of mRNAs through P-body and stress granule mRNP states.</bold> After exit from polysomes, mRNAs are bound by P-body components, forming a P-body mRNP state that could either target the mRNA for decay, or for a return to translation, initially via transition into a stress granule mRNP state. Factors affecting this decision process may include specific mRNA binding proteins (factor &#x0201c;X&#x0201d;) or the presence of a poly(A) tail. Transition into a stress granule aggregate is favored by initial accumulation and mRNP remodeling in a P-body aggregate, though direct mRNP remodeling not involving visible cytoplasmic aggregates may also occur (dashed arrow).

First, a P-body mRNP might contain specific proteins that interact with stress granule components and promote the transition from a P-body mRNP to a stress granule state. A second model is that P bodies enhance the formation of stress granules by providing a specific location for the assembly of stress granule mRNPs, which then allows them to aggregate efficiently due to their high local concentration. In this latter model, P bodies are not required for the formation of the individual mRNPs that make up stress granules, but function to facilitate their aggregation. In either case, it is important to note that stress granules represent pools of mRNAs primarily poised to reenter translation, which is also supported by the observation that stress granules disassemble faster than P bodies when yeast are triggered to reenter growth from stationary phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brengues and Parker, 2007</xref>).</p><p>Several points argue that at least some mRNAs will move from P bodies to stress granules in mammalian cells. First, the increase in P bodies before stress granules in HeLa cells during stress (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 A</xref>) is consistent with mRNAs exiting translation first entering a P-body state. Second, mammalian mRNAs within P bodies can return to translation, suggesting they can transition from P bodies to a state associated with translation factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bhattacharyya et al., 2006</xref>). Third, mammalian P bodies can form independently of stress granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kedersha et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kwon et al., 2007</xref>), although whether stress granules are dependent on preexisting P bodies has not been tested because it has not yet been possible to abolish formation of P bodies in mammalian cells during stress. Fourth, the initial concentration of the Rck protein in P bodies followed by its accumulation in stress granules is consistent with mRNPs transitioning from P bodies to stress granules (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 B</xref>). Fifth, induction of stress granules by arsenite treatment in HeLa cells leads to a &#x0201c;burst&#x0201d; of stress granules forming in association with P bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mollet et al., 2008</xref>), which is consistent with stress granules forming from mRNAs exiting P bodies. However, in contrast to yeast, mammalian stress granules, as assessed by Pabp, primarily appear first as distinct units without interaction with P bodies (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>), suggesting mammalian stress granules might be able to form independently of P bodies, or there might be dispersed small P bodies, below microscopic detection, under these nascent stress granules.</p></sec><sec><title>Implications for the nature and function of stress granules</title><p>Our results argue that stress granules do not function in translation repression or broadly preventing mRNA degradation during stress. Evidence that stress granules are not required for translation repression is that yeast strains defective in stress granule formation are still capable of translation repression during glucose deprivation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>), and mammalian cells unable to form stress granules can still repress translation in response to inhibition of HDAC6 function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kwon et al., 2007</xref>). Similarly, the enhanced stability of mRNAs under stress is not strongly reduced in strains lacking stress granules (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref>). Finally, FRAP evidence indicating the rapid movement of both RNA binding proteins and mRNA in and out of stress granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kedersha et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mollet et al., 2008</xref>) argues against a role for stress granules in prolonged mRNA storage.</p><p>An alternative possibility is that stress granules may function to increase the translation of mRNAs, particularly during stress where initiation is limiting. Note that this might be particularly important when the rates of translation initiation are compromised, under which conditions the aggregation of stalled initiation complexes together might serve to enhance translation initiation by increasing the local concentration of translation initiation factors, and/or preventing alternative fates of the mRNA such as degradation and/or disassembly of the translation initiation complex. Strikingly, all of the factors required for yeast stress granule assembly can positively influence mRNA function: (1) eIF4G is a translation initiation factor; (2) Pub1 can stabilize and enhance the translation of some mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ruiz-Echevarria and Peltz, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Duttagupta et al., 2005</xref>); and (3) Pbp1 can enhance the translation of the HO mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tadauchi et al., 2004</xref>). However, it is worth noting that certain components of yeast stress granules have also been implicated in negatively regulating mRNA translation and stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Vasudevan et al., 2005</xref>). Important areas of future work will be to determine what role stress granule proteins play in affecting mRNP transitions between polysomes and nontranslating states, as well as the consequences to the cell when stress granules cannot form.</p></sec><sec><title>A working model for the cytosolic mRNA cycle</title><p>The observations discussed above suggest a working model for the dynamics of mRNAs in the yeast cytosol with the following properties (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>). First, mRNAs that are engaged in translation are present in polysomes and distributed throughout the cytosol. Second, when translation initiation is compromised, either due to stochastic events on individual mRNAs or in response to stress inhibition of initiation, mRNAs cease translating and assemble with translation repressors and components of P bodies forming a translationally quiescent &#x0201c;P-body mRNP&#x0201d;, which can aggregate into P bodies. Third, whether assembled into a larger aggregate or not, the P-body mRNP can either be retained in this state, be decapped and degraded, or undergo protein exchange reactions that remove the P-body components and load translation initiation factors, thereby transitioning the mRNA into the type of mRNP seen in stress granules. When translation initiation is not limiting, these mRNAs would form polysomes and fail to form stress granules. In contrast, when specific steps in translation initiation are rate limiting, the accumulation of mRNPs at this stage would lead to the formation of stress granules. An important implication of this model is that transitions in mRNP composition within P bodies will be critical in determining the fate of mRNAs.</p><p>This model for cytosolic mRNA dynamics provides explanations for many observations about cytosolic mRNP granules. First, it suggests that different mRNP granules represent a continuum of mRNP states, and that different granules may be apparent if subsets of mRNPs aggregate via different mechanisms. Second, it suggests that the composition of a given granule may vary depending on the rate-limiting step in its formation and/or resolution, which may depend on the type of cellular stress encountered. For example, stress granules in mammalian cells during arsenite stress contain eIF2 and eIF3 consistent with a late block in translation initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson and Kedersha, 2006</xref>). In contrast, stress granules in yeast induced by glucose deprivation do not contain eIF2 and eIF3, suggesting the process of translation initiation is inhibited before the joining of eIF3 and eIF2 in these conditions. Third, delays in transitions between mRNP states may cause fused or hybrid granules. Together, it suggests that it will be important in future work to consider cytosolic RNP granules as representing a continuum of mRNP states and not discreet and unique granule types.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Yeast strains and growth conditions</title><p>The genotypes of strains used in this study are listed in Table S2 (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200807043/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200807043/DC1</ext-link>).
