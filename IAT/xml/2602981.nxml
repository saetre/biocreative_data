The ATP binding cassette transporter ABCG2 is expressed in a wide variety of somatic and embryonic stem cells. However, whether it plays an important role in stem cell maintenance remains to be defined.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>Here we provide evidence to show that an increase in the level of ABCG2 was observed accompanied by ES colony expansion and then were followed by decreases in the level of protoporphyrin IX (PPIX) indicating that ABCG2 plays a role in maintaining porphyrin homoeostasis. RNA-interference mediated inhibition of ABCG2 as well as functional blockage of ABCG2 transporter with fumitremorgin C (FTC), a specific and potent inhibitor of ABCG2, not only elevated the cellular level of PPIX, but also arrest the cell cycle and reduced expression of the pluripotent gene <italic>Nanog</italic>. Overexpression of ABCG2 in ES cells was able to counteract the increase of endogenous PPIX induced by treatment with 5-Aminolevulinic acid suggesting ABCG2 played a direct role in removal of PPIX from ES cells. We also found that excess PPIX in ES cells led to elevated levels of reactive oxygen species which in turn triggered DNA damage signals as indicated by increased levels of &#x003b3;H2AX and phosphorylated p53. The increased level of p53 reduced Nanog expression because RNA- interference mediated inhibition of p53 was able to prevent the downregulation of Nanog induced by FTC treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>The present work demonstrated that ABCG2 protects ES cells from PPIX accumulation during colony expansion, and that p53 and &#x003b3;H2AX acts as a downstream checkpoint of ABCG2-dependent defense machinery in order to maintain the self-renewal of ES cells.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Embryonic stem (ES) cells are pluripotent cells derived from the inner cell mass of blastocysts.

Moreover, ES cells are unique in that unlike differentiated cells they do not accumulate DNA damage during multiple self-renewal cycles. This feature is important <italic>in vivo</italic> as a small number of ES cells can contribute the whole process of embryogenesis, therefore if DNA damage accumulated in ES cells could potentially affect development of different tissue types.</p><p>One of the major causes of DNA damage in cells is reactive oxygen species (ROS). Several studies have shown that low/moderate levels of ROS generated from cell metabolism play an important role in maintenance physiological functions of cells and in some cases are even used as the signaling mediator <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004023-Hensley1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.

In fact, it has been shown that the mutation frequency in ES cells is low because ES cells are sensitive to DNA damage and readily undergo apoptosis or differentiation in order to remove damaged cells from the self-renewal pool <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004023-deWaard1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004023-VanSloun1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover, in order to prevent excessive ROS levels ES cells express high levels of antioxidant defense enzymes as well as high activity of verapamil-sensitive multidrug transporter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004023-Maynard1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004023-Saretzki1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The ATP binding cassette transporter ABCG2 is a verapamil-sensitive multidrug transporter that is expressed in a wide variety of drug-resistant cancer cells, extrudes xenobiotics and certain drugs from cells, thereby mediating drug resistance and affecting the pharmacological behavior of many compounds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004023-Challen1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004023-Krishnamurthy1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>.

Interestingly despite the clear correlation between ABCG2 and stem cells, its exact function in these cells has not been elucidated.</p><p>Recently it has been shown that ABCG2 plays a role in enhancing the survival of haematopoetic stem cells in hypoxia, which is possibly mediated through transportation of heme and porphyrins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004023-Krishnamurthy2">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Heme is composed of iron and protoporphyrin IX (PPIX) which is s an essential component of various hemoproteins, including cytochromes involved in mitochondrial electron transfer chain and in drug metabolism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004023-Krishnamurthy3">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. Hemes are also important cofactors in oxygen storage and transport (such as hemoglobin and myoglobin), signaling mediator (nitric oxide synthases, guanylate cyclases) and in regulation of antioxidant-defense enzymes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004023-Krishnamurthy3">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004023-Ponka1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>.

Recently identified heme/porphyrin transporters such as heme carrier protein 1 (HCP1), FLVCR, ABCB6 and ABCG2 are expected to play an important role in maintaining a homeostatic level of porphyrins</p><p>Developing embryos naturally resides in hypoxic microenvironments and low level of oxygen regulates cell fate decision of embryonic stem/progenitor cells. Recent work further suggests undifferentiated mouse ES cells adapt their energy metabolism to proliferate at different oxygen tension <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004023-Powers1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Cellular adaptations to changes in oxygen levels include stimulating several hypoxia-inducible factors that mediate oxygen homeostasis and control the level of heme, a molecule whose level changes in response to changes in cellular oxygen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004023-Hofer1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004023-Ryter1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>.

We speculate PPIX homeostasis in ES cells is maintained by ABCG2 in order to adapt to changes in oxygen availability during rapid colony expansion. However, if ABCG2 function was disrupted, the accumulation of PPIX possibly lead to increased level of ROS would therefore induce DNA damage and then trigger downstream checkpoint signals, which may in turn cause the ES cell to lose its pluripotency as well as disrupting the self-renewal cycle.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Inhibition of ABCG2 leads to downregulation of Nanog in mouse ES cells</title><p>No detailed data was available regarding the expression of ABCG2 in mouse ES cells.

When mouse ES cells were treated with either 1 or 10 &#x000b5;M FTC for 72 hours, we observed that expression levels of ABCG2 remained similar to those of control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004023-g001">Fig 1B</xref>). However, Nanog expression was significantly downregulated in the 10 &#x000b5;M FTC-treated cells, as observed by both Immunofluorescence staining and real-time RT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004023-g001">Fig. 1C, F&#x02013;T</xref>). We were also able to detect expression of the early ectodermal marker Nestin in FTC treated mES cells indicating perhaps that some of the ES cells have started to undergo differentiation.</p><p>To confirm whether the downregulation of Nanog was specifically caused by inhibition of ABCG2, we designed two shRNA constructs based on RNAi Codex database <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004023-Olson1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>: shABCG2-2 and shABCG2-3, which specifically target the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; ends of ABCG2. Transfection with shABCG2-2 or shABCG2-3 reduced Nanog expression in ES cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004023-g002">Fig. 2E, G</xref>). Immunofluorescence staining confirmed the downregulation of ABCG2 by the shRNA constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004023-g002">Fig. 2C&#x02013;D</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004023-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>, GFP (a marker of transfection) colocalized with low levels of ABCG2 staining demonstrating that transfection with shABCG2-3 downregulated ABCG2 expression in these mouse ES cells. Expression of Oct-4 was not altered significantly in shABCG2-3 transfected cells, as there were no GFP-positive cells that colocalized with reduced Oct-4 staining (data not shown). However, expression of Nanog was downregulated in shABCG2-3 transfectants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004023-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>). RT-PCR of GFP-sorted transfected cells confirmed this data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004023-g002">Fig. 2E</xref>) and utilizing real-time PCR we found that transfection with both shABCG2 construct was sufficient to reduce ABCG2 expression by approximately 70&#x00025; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004023-g002">Fig. 2F</xref>). Nanog expression was reduced by approximately 60&#x00025; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004023-g002">Fig. 2G</xref>).

However, these measurements were done on ES cells that have been grown for 4 days. In order to confirm that accumulation of PPIX in ES cells was directly due to lack of PPIX-transportation by ABCG2, we needed to perform the assay over a shorter period. We decided to do this by inducing high levels of PPIX in ES cells with 1 mM ALA treatment and allowing 1 hour for efflux. Here, we observe that FTC treated as well as shABCG2 inhibited ES cells did show a reduced ability to efflux PPIX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004023-g005">Fig. 5E, G</xref>). Conversely, overexpression of ABCG2 in ES cells increased their ability to efflux PPIX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004023-g005">Fig. 5F</xref>).

We demonstrate that disruption of ABCG2 function in ES cells can lead to accumulation of PPIX over time.

Furthermore, we did not observe significant increases of apoptosis in ABCG2-inhibited ES cells. In contrast, we obtained a dramatic upregulation in the nuclear level of p53, which was able to suppress Nanog expression in ABCG2-inhibited ES cells.

In accordance with this, we speculate that the variance seen in the expression of ABCG2 in different mES cells could be correlated with their oxygen availability and proliferation rate. Indeed, from the four different mES cells tested B6 is known to have a slower proliferation rate compared to R1 and J1, which might explain the lower ABCG2 expression seen in B6 compared to R1 and J1.
