Cancer tissue is often characterized by altered energy regulation. Fatty acid-binding proteins (FABP) are involved in the intracellular transport of fatty acids (FA). We examined the level of brain-type (B) and liver-type (L) FABP mRNA and the protein expression profiles of both FABPs in renal cell carcinoma.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Paired tissue samples of cancerous and noncancerous kidney parts were investigated. Quantitative RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry and western blotting were used to determine B- and L-FABP in tumor and normal tissues. The tissue microarray (TMA) contained 272 clinico-pathologically characterized renal cell carcinomas of the clear cell, papillary and chromophobe subtype. SPSS 17.0 was used to apply crosstables (&#x003c7;<sup>2</sup>-test), correlations and survival analyses.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>B-FABP mRNA was significantly up-regulated in renal cell carcinoma. In normal tissue B-FABP mRNA was very low or often not detectable. RCC with a high tumor grading (G3 + G4) showed significantly lower B-FABP mRNA compared with those with a low grading (G1 + G2). Western blotting analysis detected B-FABP in 78% of the cases with a very strong band but in the corresponding normal tissue it was weak or not detectable. L-FABP showed an inverse relationship for mRNA quantification and western blotting. A strong B-FABP staining was present in 52% of the tumor tissues contained in the TMA. In normal renal tissue, L-FABP showed a moderate to strong immunoreactivity in proximal tubuli. L-FABP was expressed at lower rates compared with the normal tissues in 30.5% of all tumors. There was no correlation between patient survival times and the staining intensity of both FABPs.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>While B-FABP is over expressed in renal cell carcinoma in comparison to normal renal tissues L-FABP appears to be reduced in tumor tissue. Although the expression behavior was not related to the survival outcome of the RCC patients, it can be assumed that these changes indicate fundamental alterations in the fatty metabolism in the RCC carcinogenesis. Further studies should identify the role of both FABPs in carcinogenesis, progression and with regard to a potential target in RCC.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>In adults, renal cell carcinoma (RCC) represents about 4% of all malignant solid tumors. In 2008, RCC was expected to result in 54390 new cases and in 13010 deaths in the USA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The prognosis of patients with distant metastasis is very poor with a 5-year survival rate of less than 10% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], whereas patients with tumor stages pT1 and pT2 show a survival rate of 80&#x02013;90% during the first 5 years after diagnosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. An early diagnosis renders curative surgery possible and thus improves prognosis. Therefore, novel biomarkers are needed, firstly, as tools to detect tumors early and secondly, as therapeutic targets to improve treatment options [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>Cancer is characterized by an altered energy regulation. Fatty acid-binding proteins (FABPs) are involved in the uptake, the intracellular transport, and the delivery of fatty acids to beta-oxidation. FABPs are also important in cell signaling, regulation of gene expression, cell growth, and differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Currently, nine members of the FABP family have been identified named after the first tissue of isolation: (a) liver (L-FABP); (b) intestinal (I-FABP); (c) heart (H-FABP); (d) adipocyte (A-FABP); (e) epidermal (E-FABP); (f) ileal (IL-FABP); (g) brain (B-FABP); (h) myelin (M-FABP) and (i) testis (T-FABP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>The importance of FABPs for the progression of carcinomas was shown for prostate cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], bladder cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and astrocytomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Search in free available mRNA data bases revealed the brain-type FABP (B-FABP) as strongly over-expressed in RCC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. A heterogeneous expression pattern of various members of the FABP-family was demonstrated in RCC by immunoblotting and RT-PCR analyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In healthy and benign kidney parenchyma, L-FABP is localized in proximal tubules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>However, these data obtained from a limited number of cases did not allow a clear conclusion with regard to the clinical usefulness of these potential markers. Therefore, the objectives of the present study were related to clear cell RCC (ccRCC), the most common (75% of cases) renal cancer subtype with the most serious prognosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The study was aimed (a) to compare expression of B-FABP and L-FABP on protein and transcript level in noncancerous areas and RCC lesions of surgically resected kidneys, (b) to correlate these expression data with clinico-pathological parameters concerning its diagnostic value, and (c) to evaluate the immunohistochemical staining data of B-FABP on a RCC tissue-microarray with the survival outcome of RCC patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Patients (reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction)</title><p>Forty-eight matched (malignant and nonmalignant) specimens from kidney were used for total RNA isolation.

Staging met the UICC 2002 criteria. Histological classification was performed according to the WHO criteria, tumor grading was accomplished according to Fuhrman. The Fuhrman grades were G1 in 3 (6.2%), G2 in 31 (64.6%), G3 in 12 (25%) and G4 in 2 (4.2%) cases respectively. This cohort enclosed patients without (n = 28) and with metastasis (n = 20).

Then a ratio of tumor to normal tissue was calculated. The B-FABP expression in tumor tissues was classified in three groups. For six patients the calculated ratio was higher 2. The ratio was higher 1 and lower 2 for five patients and only three patients showed a ratio lower 1. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> illustrates representative blot of the three B-FABP groups and of L-FABP protein expression in normal and renal tumor extracts. Out of the 14 patients investigated, 11 patients (78%) expressed B-FABP in tumor tissue. In the corresponding normal tissues, the B-FABP was negligible or very weak. An association between the B-FABP protein expression and the tumor stage or grade was not calculated because of the small number of samples (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Western blot detection of FABP</bold>.

That effect is already statistically significant (for L-FABP Log-rank test, p = 0.038) or evident in tendency (for B-FABP Log-rank test, p = 0.107) in patients with tumor grade G1 and G2 whereas there were no correlations in those with the high tumor grades G3 and G4 (Log-rank test, p = 0.241 and p = 0.919, respectively). Using the multivariable Cox regression analysis with the variables pT stage, grade, and FABPs, the two FABPs did not arise as independent variables (Log-rank test, p = 0.283 for B-FABP; and Log-rank test, p = 0.945 for L-FABP). In a final selective model after a forward elimination procedure, only tumor grade remained as significant parameter (hazard ratio of 5.59, p &#x0003c; 0.0001).</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Kaplan-Meier survival curves for B- and L-FABP mRNA expression</bold>.

More than fifty percent of the RCC cases showed a B-FABP staining of different intensity. This staining (all intensities together) was not significantly associated with a shorter survival time (Log-rank test, p = 0.117) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>). The same was seen in the subgroup of ccRCC (Log-rank test, p = 0.236), in papillary RCC (Log-rank test, p = 0.715) and in chromophobe RCC (Log-rank test, p = 0.718).</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>Kaplan-Meier survival curves for tumor stage and Fuhrman grades in the TMA cohort</bold>. <bold>(A) </bold>Survival curves for tumor stage.

This group contained 79 clear cell, 13 papillary and 4 chromophobe type RCCs (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Because of the low number of the latter two RCC types only Kaplan-Meier analysis was done for ccRCC. In this subgroup of patients, staining of B- and L-FABP was not related to a shorter survival time (Log-rank-test, p = 0.27 and p = 0.96, respectively).

Also, the markedly increased total lipid content in renal cell carcinomas responsible for their grossly yellow appearance is considered a diagnostic hallmark of this tumor type [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Therefore, it did not come as a surprise when recently up-regulation of fatty acid synthase (FAS) in RCC with advanced pathological T stages was demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. This finding further underscores the high metabolic activities of RCC. B- and L-FABP are cytosolic proteins of the fatty acid binding protein family as briefly mentioned in the introduction. The FABP immunostaining in our TMA is a predominantly cytoplasmic, often membrane accentuated staining pattern. Nuclei are also positive in some cases, but were not taken into further consideration. At the inner side of the cell membrane, fatty acids are bound to cytoplasmic FABPs. They may actively facilitate the transport of lipids to specific compartments in the cell.</p><p>Movement of FABPs into the nucleus and interaction with nuclear hormone receptors (i.e. PPAR) is possible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. In normal renal tissue, L-FABP showed a moderate to strong immunoreactivity in proximal tubuli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. These proteins are responsible for the uptake and transport of bioactive lipids within the cells. The FABPs can bind many different groups of fatty acids and their derivates. FABPs were extensively investigated for various diseases such as acute and chronic myocardial injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], lung injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], psoriasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] and chronic kidney disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Changes of the different FABP subtypes were further shown for various tumors like prostate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], breast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], and bladder cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] as well as astrocytomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>We analyzed the B-FABP expression on the protein and transcript level in noncancerous areas and RCC lesions of surgically resected kidneys. B-FABP was over-expressed in mRNA-level in renal cell carcinoma in comparison to normal renal tissues (p &#x0003c; 0.0001). In tumors with a low grading (G1 and G2), the B-FABP mRNA was particularly high, whereas expression levels of B-FABP-mRNA were lower in poorly (G3 and G4) differentiated tumors. On protein level, B-FABP is detectable in 78% of cases in RCC tissues. Conversely, the L-FABP-mRNA was highly expressed in normal renal tissue and not detectable in RCC tissues independent on tumor grading and staging. These mRNA data corresponded with the western blot analyses as L-FABP was exclusively detectable in all (14) normal renal tissue lysates but not in RCC samples. These results provide additional evidence of altered fatty acid metabolism in RCC since the preferred FABP-type localized in the proximal tubules of the normal kidney is substituted in renal carcinomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Changed expression of FABPs was also found in other organs and cell lines. Hammamieh [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] observed an increase of L-and I-FABP in prostate and breast cancer cell lines, while A- and E-FABP were reduced in these cells compared to normal cells. Experimental blocking L-FABP resulted in the activation of antiproliferative genes like TNF-&#x003b1; and the induction of apoptosis. However, in contrast to the reduced E-FABP expression data in the cell lines, an over-expression of E-FABP was found in prostate carcinoma tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. More differentiated bladder squamous cell carcinomas exhibited higher level of E-FABP than less-differentiated tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].</p><p>Teratani et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] suggested the use of B-FABP transcripts as a novel urine marker for early detection of RCC and for monitoring RCC patients postoperatively. They also showed a significant over-expression of B-FABP gene in RCC samples depending on the tumor stage. However, our results based on matched pairs of malignant and non-malignant samples from the same tumor proved that the tumor grade more distinctly influence the expression. So it was possible to demonstrate that samples of the grades G1 and G2 displayed a 6410-fold (median) over-expression, whereas samples of the G3 and G4 showed only a 39-fold (median) over-expression. By immunoblotting and RT-PCR analyses, a heterogeneous expression pattern of various members of the FABP-family was demonstrated in RCC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. However, all these data obtained from a limited number of RCC cases did not allow a clear conclusion with regard to the clinical usefulness of these potential markers and an extensive analysis was pending.</p><p>In our study we utilized a tissue micro-array with 272 fully characterized cancer cases to provide reliable data on the immunohistochemical staining pattern of both FABPs in relation to clinico-pathological parameters and on the prognostic potential of B- and L-FABP. Our Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses with the limited number of mRNA expressions data showed that both FABPs were no independent prognostic variables for the survival of patients. The immunohistochemical analyses also demonstrated that about fifty-five percent (54.9%) of the ccRCC cases showed a B-FABP staining of different intensity but not advantage was detected concerning survival times. While the conventional prognostic markers tumor stage and tumor grade were confirmed as risk factors in our study group, the over-expression of B-FABP was not an independent prognostic marker. These results partly contrast with the data of other FABP types from other cancer types. For example, Ohlsson [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] was able to demonstrate with a TMA containing more then 2,000 cases that the loss of A-FABP in urothelial carcinomas was associated with tumor progression. These results generally suggest that FABPs could have prognostic potential at least in combination with other biomarkers.</p><p>Above all, the metabolism of fatty acids respectively lipids is markedly changed in tumors, confirming the early observation of Warburg that tumor cells are characterized by an altered energy metabolism. The over-expression suggests that B-FABP might be a potential therapeutic target in RCC. Recently, small series of A-FABP inhibitors have been identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. One member of the FABP family, L-FABP is controlled by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) family. L-FABP interacts with PPAR&#x003b1; and PPAR&#x003b3; by protein-protein contacts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] and affects, in addition to the fatty acid metabolism, drug signaling regarding the PPAR&#x003b1; activation. That effect could be assumed as general principle of the interaction of the different FABP types with the PPAR isoforms. Since expression of PPAR isoforms are commonly dysregulated in human carcinomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] and novel therapeutic options are provided by the anti-diabetic drug class of thiazolidindiones, further studies are clearly warranted to identify the role of B- and L-FABP in relation to PPAR isoforms in carcinogenesis and progression of renal cancer.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our results showed a differential expression of B-FABP and L-FABP in RCC samples both on the transcriptional and protein level. B-FABP was highly over-expressed in RCC whereas L-FABP was significantly reduced. Although the expression behavior was not related to the survival outcome of the RCC patients, it can be assumed that these changes indicate fundamental alterations in the fatty metabolism in the RCC carcinogenesis that warrants further study with regard to a potential target in RCC.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>AT coordinated the study, performed western blots and statistical analyses and wrote the paper.
