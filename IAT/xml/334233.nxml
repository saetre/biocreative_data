Induction rates in the transcriptionally active genes Gart and Notch as well as in the inactive white locus is similar. They are formed with a frequency of about one-third of that of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs). In all three genes, (6-4)PPs are repaired with the same rate and to the same extent: 31% of the (6-4)PPs are removed in 4 hours post-irradiation and after 16 hours repair is nearly complete. In none of the three genes strand-specific repair was found. Exposure of cells that were irradiated with 40 J/m2 UV to photoreactivating light for 1 hour prior to dark-repair incubation, resulted in enhanced repair of (6-4)PPs.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00229-0094-a" xlink:role="4791"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00229-0094-b" xlink:role="4791"/></fig><fig id="F3"><graphic xlink:href="nar00229-0095-a" xlink:role="4792"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00229-0092.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4789"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00229-0093.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4790"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00229-0094.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4791"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00229-0095.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4792"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00229-0096.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4793"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
