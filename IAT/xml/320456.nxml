These families were classified in groups and subgroups based on their amino acid sequences. Genes belonging to a distinct subgroup are believed to occur in the genome within clusters. We are investigating the organization of human variable region genes of the kappa type (VK genes, ref. 1) in the germline and found now for the first time that VK sequences of three of the four different subgroups are interdigitated within the VK locus. We present evidence for the interspersion of two VKIII genes and a VKII pseudogene within an array of five VKI genes. All eight VK sequences are arranged in the same orientation. An evolutionary model for the generation of this 'mixed cluster' is discussed.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00342-0014.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9229"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00342-0015.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9230"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00342-0016.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9231"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00342-0017.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9232"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00342-0018.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9233"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00342-0019.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9234"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00342-0020.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9235"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00342-0021.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9236"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
