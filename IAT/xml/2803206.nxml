In an effort to identify genes involved in nectar production, the Affymetrix<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> ATH1 GeneChip was previously used to examine global gene expression profiles in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> nectaries. One of the genes displaying highly enriched expression in nectaries was <italic>CELL WALL INVERTASE 4</italic> (<italic>AtCWINV4</italic>, At2g36190), which encodes an enzyme that putatively catalyses the hydrolysis of sucrose into glucose and fructose. RT-PCR was used to confirm the nectary-enriched expression of <italic>AtCWINV4</italic>, as well as an orthologue from <italic>Brassica rapa</italic>. To probe biological function, two independent <italic>Arabidopsis cwinv4</italic> T-DNA mutants were isolated. Unlike wild-type plants, <italic>cwinv4</italic> lines did not produce nectar. While overall nectary morphology appeared to be normal, <italic>cwinv4</italic> flowers accumulated higher than normal levels of starch in the receptacle, but not within the nectaries themselves. Conversely, wild-type, but not <italic>cwinv4</italic>, nectarial stomata stained intensely for starch. Cell wall extracts prepared from mutant flowers displayed greatly reduced invertase activity when compared with wild-type plants, and <italic>cwinv4</italic> flowers also accumulated significantly lower levels of total soluble sugar. Cumulatively, these results implicate CWINV4 as an absolutely required factor for nectar production in the Brassicaceae, specifically by maintaining constant sink status within nectaries, thus allowing them to accumulate the sugars necessary for nectar production. In addition, CWINV4 is probably responsible for the hexose-rich composition observed for many Brassicaceae nectars.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Brassica rapa</italic></kwd><kwd>cell wall invertase</kwd><kwd>invertase</kwd><kwd>nectar</kwd><kwd>nectaries</kwd><kwd>nectary</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Nectar is secreted by many angiosperms as a reward to promote pollinator visitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Simpson and Neff, 1983</xref>). This mutually beneficial process increases pollination efficiency and, ultimately, the propagation of plant species. Nectar is a complex solution that consists not only of sugars, which can range from 8% to 80% (w/w) depending on the species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baker and Baker, 1983</xref>), but also a multitude of additional components, including: amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baker and Baker, 1973</xref>), organic acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baker and Baker, 1975</xref>), terpenes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ecroyd <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>), alkaloids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Deinzer <italic>et al.</italic>, 1977</xref>), flavonoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ferreres <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>), glycosides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Roshchina and Roshchina, 1993</xref>), vitamins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Griebel and Hess, 1990</xref>), phenolics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ferreres <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>), metal ions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Heinrich, 1989</xref>), oils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Vogel, 1969</xref>), free fatty acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kram <italic>et al.</italic>, 2008</xref>), and proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carter and Thornburg, 2004</xref>). These non-sugar compounds have been shown to perform a wide variety of tasks, from acting as a deterrent to certain visitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baker, 1978</xref>), to promoting pollination by attracting cognate pollinators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carter <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Raguso and Pichersky, 1999</xref>).</p><p>Of the sugars found in nectar, the most prevalent are sucrose, glucose, and fructose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baker and Baker, 1983</xref>). The predominant forms of these three carbohydrates in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> nectar are the simple hexoses glucose and fructose. For example, it was previously reported that <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> nectar has a hexose (glucose+fructose)-to-sucrose ratio close to 33.33 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Davis <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>). Various nectars also contain multiple forms of other carbohydrates in minor concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baker and Baker, 1983</xref>), which are thought to play important roles as supplementary nutrition for potential pollinators.</p><p>The floral organ responsible for nectar synthesis and secretion is the nectary. <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> flowers contain two types of nectaries, lateral and median, with lateral nectaries being more pronounced and responsible for nearly all nectar production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Davis <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>). Furthermore, the lateral nectary is much more heavily innervated by sieve tubes than the median, which could also account for its higher level of nectar secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Davis <italic>et al.</italic>, 1986</xref>). Although it is known that the nectary is responsible for nectar production and secretion, the specific genes responsible for the underlying processes are not. With this in mind, there is a clear understanding of some of the cellular processes that take place in nectariferous cells (nectar-secreting cells) during secretion. At the initiation of secretion, vacuoles found inside these cells increase in volume, dictyosome numbers are reduced, the endoplasmic reticulum becomes more active, and mitochondrial numbers increase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhu and Hu, 2002</xref>). Along with increased organelle activity, starch grains found in the chloroplasts become reduced in size, or disappear altogether, indicating that they probably contribute to the carbohydrate component of the nectar itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ren <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhu and Hu, 2002</xref>).</p><p>With an understanding of the basic processes taking place at an ultrastructural level, a general pathway for nectar secretion out of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, and other merocrine-type, nectaries has been proposed. Starting from the phloem, pre-nectar metabolites are transported via plasmodesmata to pre-secretory nectariferous tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fahn, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pacini and Nepi, 2007</xref>). Here the pre-nectar is stored as starch grains in chloroplasts until nectar production begins; although it is also possible that some photosynthate is produced <italic>in situ</italic>, as has been reported for <italic>Brassica napus</italic> nectaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Davis <italic>et al.</italic>, 1986</xref>). When needed, starch grains are degraded and the endoplasmic reticulum and dictyosomes modify the sugars derived from degraded starch grains and package them into vesicles that fuse with the plasma membrane for secretion. It is also likely that some nectar carbohydrate, in the form of sucrose, is directly transported to secretory cells from underlying sieve tubes via plasmodesmata, and that plasma membrane transporters may play a direct role in the secretion of some nectar solutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fahn, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pacini and Nepi, 2007</xref>). The specific point of secretion from the nectary is thought to be modified stomata, which remain permanently open, providing a direct path out of the nectary (Davis AR, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bowman, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhu <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhu and Hu, 2002</xref>). Similar mechanisms for nectar production have been proposed for a number of other species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ge <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wist and Davis, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Horner <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pacini and Nepi, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ren <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>).</p><p>As described above, a number of ultrastructural and physiological aspects of nectary function are known; however, the impacts of individual genes on <italic>de novo</italic> nectar production are largely unknown. To link individual genes to nectar synthesis and secretion, the Affymetrix<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> ATH1 GeneChip was previously used to assess global gene expression profiles within nectaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kram <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). This analysis identified a large number of genes with relatively nectary-specific expression profiles. Amongst these genes, <italic>CELL WALL INVERTASE 4</italic> (<italic>AtCWINV4</italic>, At2g36190) was particularly up-regulated in nectaries. The characterization of two independent <italic>Arabidopsis cwinv4</italic> mutant lines is described here, the results of which implicate cell wall invertase activity as an absolutely required factor for nectar production in the Brassicaceae. Since nectar volume and composition can significantly affect the frequency of flower visitation by pollinators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Silva and Dean, 2000</xref>), knowledge of the genes required for nectar production may have broad implications, ranging from a better understanding of the co-evolution of plant&#x02013;pollinator interactions, to increasing pollination efficiency in multiple crop species.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Plant material and growth conditions</title><p><italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> ecotype Columbia-0 was the primary genotypic background used for this study.

This report describes initial efforts towards characterizing <italic>CELL WALL INVERTASE 4</italic>, a gene required for nectar production in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of an individual gene being required for <italic>de novo</italic> nectar production in flowering plants.</p><p>Plant invertases have been classified into several general types based upon subcellular localization and pH optima. Cell wall invertases, in particular, are adventitiously bound to cell walls and function optimally in an acidic pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sturm, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sturm and Tang, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tymowska-Lalanne and Kreis, 1998<italic>a</italic></xref>, <italic>b</italic>). The model plant <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> encodes over 20 known or putative invertases (The <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> Information Resource (TAIR), www.arabidopsis.org). Of these gene products, at least four are known or predicted to be localized to the cell wall. Significantly, cell wall invertases have been shown to exhibit both temporal and spatial specificity in their expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sherson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). Of interest in this study was <italic>AtCWINV4</italic>, which displayed exceptionally enhanced expression in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> nectaries of both pre- and post-anthesis flowers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kram <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>).

Sucrose is one of the most important products of photosynthesis, and is the form in which most carbohydrates are transported between tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Roitsch, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Roitsch and Ehness, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Winter and Huber, 2000<italic>a</italic></xref>, <italic>b</italic>). This disaccharide has also been shown to play important roles in plant signalling, growth, and developmental processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Weber <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sturm, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sturm and Tang, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Winter and Huber, 2000<italic>a</italic></xref>, <italic>b</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sherson <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berger <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). Because of the catabolic nature of invertases, it is thought that these enzymes could be prime mediators of source&#x02013;sink relationships, driving the flow of sucrose from source to sink tissues and, in turn, regulating plant growth and development.</p><p>Perhaps most significantly in this study, nectar was found to be absent in <italic>cwinv4</italic> flowers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>), which could be explained by the suggested role of invertases in establishing sucrose gradients between source and sink tissues. If this interpretation is accurate, the loss of invertase function would be paired with a reduction in the extracellular hydrolysis of sucrose into glucose and fructose. A role for CWINV4 acting in this manner was supported by the finding that <italic>cwinv4</italic> flowers displayed markedly decreased CWINV activities when compared to wild-type plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>). Such disruption of the sucrose gradient from source to sink cells would result in the cessation of sugar flow into nectaries, thus depriving nectariferous tissue of the sugars required for nectar production.</p><p>The mechanistic impact of CWINV4 activity on nectar production is perhaps 2-fold. CWINV4 may drive the movement of sucrose into nectaries from source tissues, which, in turn, is deposited as starch (supported by <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4C&#x02013;F</xref>). Significantly, starch accumulation within <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> nectaries has been previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bowman, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhu <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhu and Hu, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ren <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>); at anthesis, starch grains are reportedly degraded and are a presumed source of nectar carbohydrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ren <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). CWINV4 involvement in starch accumulation in nectaries is supported by two pieces of evidence in this study: (i) increased starch accumulation within the receptacle and pedicel of <italic>cwinv4</italic> flowers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4C, D</xref>), and (ii) intense IKI staining in the stomata of wild-type nectaries, as opposed to <italic>cwinv4</italic> flowers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4E, F</xref>). Taken together, these findings suggest that CWINV4-deficient nectaries lack the sink status necessary to accumulate starch, with excess photosynthate apparently being stored within the receptacle and pedicel instead. Significantly, pedicels have been suggested to serve as sources of nectar carbohydrate via the direct production of photosynthate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pacini and Nepi, 2007</xref>), which would also be consistent with the observed starch staining patterns observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4D</xref>. The fact that <italic>cwinv4</italic> flowers accumulated less soluble sugar than wild-type flowers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>) is a final piece of evidence suggesting a role for CWINV4 in supplying nectariferous tissue with the sugars necessary for nectar production.</p><p>A second, but non-mutually exclusive, hypothesis for CWINV4 involvement in nectar production can be posited for flowers at anthesis. Without hydrolysis of sucrose to glucose and fructose within the apoplast of nectary cells, an extracellular hexose-rich environment (high solute) would not be established and, in turn, osmotic pressure might be insufficient to draw out water&#x02014;a suggested requirement for the secretion of hexose-dominant nectars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fahn, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nicolson, 1998</xref>). Moreover, the spontaneity of sucrose transport across the plasma membrane of nectariferous cells, probably via sucrose transporters, would be greatly diminished in <italic>cwinv4</italic> nectaries. Interestingly, genes representing the full canonical sucrose biosynthesis pathway are highly up-regulated in mature <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> nectaries, along with several putative sucrose transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kram <italic>et al.</italic>, 2009</xref>). These overall findings are consistent with a mechanism for generating the high hexose-to-sucrose ratio previously reported for the nectars of multiple Brassicaceae species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Davis <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>). Indeed, it is likely that CWINV4 activity is at least partially responsible for the observed hexose-rich composition of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> nectar. Invertase activity has even been reported to occur within the nectars of multiple species, and implicated as a factor required for the generation of hexose-dominant nectar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baker and Baker, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nicolson, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Heil <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). Reports of this activity within nectar itself are also consistent with cell wall localization or, at a minimum, the secretion of invertases from nectary cells.</p><p>In sum, all current evidence indicates that cell wall invertase activity, specifically derived from AtCWINV4, plays an essential role in the production of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> nectar. The fact that an orthologue from <italic>B. rapa</italic>, <italic>BrCWINV4</italic>, displayed nearly identical expression patterns to <italic>AtCWINV4</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1B</xref>) suggests that the requirement of cell wall invertases in nectar production is conserved amongst the Brassicaceae, and possibly many other nectar-producing plants. Indeed, investigations into petunia pollination syndromes have identified a single QTL, which may encode an invertase, responsible for the control of nectar volume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Stuurman <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Galliot <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006<italic>a</italic></xref>, <italic>b</italic>). Teasing apart the proposed mechanisms of CWINV4 involvement in nectar production will require further experimentation; however, its nectary-specific expression profile, coupled with its apparent involvement in sugar metabolism, suggests it is a principal player in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> nectary function.</p></sec><sec><title>Supplementary data</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/erp309/DC1">Supplementary data</ext-link> can be found at <italic>JXB</italic> online.</p><p><bold><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/erp309/DC1">Supplementary Table S1.</ext-link></bold> Normalized Affymetrix ATH1 GeneChip<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> probe set signal intensity for <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> invertase genes expressed in nectaries (.xls format).</p><p><bold><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/erp309/DC1">Supplementary Video S1.</ext-link></bold> Projection video of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> flower expressing <italic>AtCWINV4</italic>::AtCWINV4:GFP fusion (.mov format).</p><p><bold><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jxb.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/erp309/DC1">Supplementary Video S2</ext-link></bold>.
