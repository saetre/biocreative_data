To identify the mechanisms of immune protection against these pathogens and also to evaluate promising vaccine candidates, a small animal model would be desirable. We demonstrate that primary T cell responses in mice with reconstituted human immune system components control infection with the oncogenic and persistent Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). These cytotoxic and interferon-&#x003b3;&#x02013;producing T cell responses were human leukocyte antigen (HLA) restricted and specific for EBV-derived peptides. In HLA-A2 transgenic animals and similar to human EBV carriers, T cell responses against lytic EBV antigens dominated over recognition of latent EBV antigens. T cell depletion resulted in elevated viral loads and emergence of EBV-associated lymphoproliferative disease. Both loss of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells abolished immune control. Therefore, this mouse model recapitulates features of symptomatic primary EBV infection and generates T cell&#x02013;mediated immune control that resists oncogenic transformation.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Mice are a preferred species for many avenues of immunological research in vivo. Because of the evolutionary divergence of mouse and man 65 million years ago, however, these two species have inhabited different ecological niches and have been challenged with minimally overlapping groups of pathogens. The human and mouse immune systems, evolving to meet these challenges, have therefore accumulated many differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>), making genes related to immunity, together with genes involved in reproduction and olfaction, the most divergent between the two species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>).</p><p>Pathogens that drive this divergence are those that exclusively infect either humans or mice with a high frequency of population penetration and life-threatening pathology. One such example is EBV, a human &#x003b3;-herpesvirus that infects &#x0003e;90% of the human adult population. Humans are the only known natural reservoir for EBV, and this virus is associated with malignancies of lymphocyte and epithelial cell origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>). EBV is thought to cause or contribute to these life-threatening tumors by its ability to induce proliferation and to protect infected cells from apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>). All EBV-associated lymphomas and carcinomas express latent EBV antigens, whereas lytic EBV particle production does not cause significant pathology. Latent EBV antigen expression differs between the various EBV-associated malignancies. Burkitt lymphoma expresses only the nuclear antigen 1 of EBV (EBNA1) as the sole latent gene product (latency I). In contrast, Hodgkin lymphoma and nasopharyngeal carcinoma express, in addition, one or both latent membrane proteins (LMPs), LMP1 and 2 (latency II). Only in immune-compromised patients, like HIV-infected individuals or transplant recipients, do B cell lymphomas occur that express the five additional EBNA proteins 2, 3A, B, C, and LP (latency III). In addition, all EBV-infected B cells express small nontranslated virally encoded RNAs, including the EBV-encoded RNAs (EBERs). All three types of EBV latencies can also be found in healthy EBV carriers, and this graded EBV protein expression depends on the B cell differentiation stage of the infected cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>). Healthy virus carriers therefore have already established tumor-associated latent EBV protein expression. Hence, the increased risk of immune-compromised individuals to develop EBV-associated tumors indicates loss of EBV-specific immune control that normally prevents viral tumorigenesis.</p><p>T cells constitute the decisive component of EBV-specific immune control against virus-associated malignancies because adoptive transfer of EBV-specific T cell lines can eradicate EBV-associated posttransplant lymphomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>). During primary infection, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells targeting epitopes of EBV lytic antigens make up the majority of EBV-specific T cells, but T cells targeting latent epitopes can also be detected. Different latency patterns confer different degrees of immunogenicity for recognition by cytotoxic CD8<sup>+</sup> and helper CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>). In healthy EBV carriers, the EBNA3 proteins are the dominant targets of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses, whereas EBNA1, 2, and 3C are the most consistently recognized CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell antigens. In contrast, the LMPs are subdominant T cell antigens. At least a subset of investigated CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T clones, however, recognize both dominant and subdominant specificities directly on EBV-infected cells. Both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells therefore contribute to immune control against virus-infected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>), in addition to maintenance of functional CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell memory by CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>).</p><p>The lack of an animal model of EBV infection prevents assignment of a protective value to the known T cell reactivities. Design and evaluation of vaccines against EBV-associated tumors and symptomatic primary infection, however, require knowledge about the degree of protection conferred by different EBV-specific immune responses. Mouse models that partially reconstitute human immune system components after engraftment of hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) are of particular interest to study vaccine candidates and EBV-specific immune responses in vivo. In this respect, three novel models of human immune system reconstitution are being considered. The first one uses BALB/c Rag2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> &#x003b3;<sub>c</sub><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, which reconstitute macrophages, T cells, B cells, natural killer cells, and dendritic cells after neonatal intrahepatic HPC transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>). The second model reconstitutes NOD-<italic>scid</italic> &#x003b3;<sub>c</sub><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice by intravenous injection of human HPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>), which also leads to significant development of human myeloid and lymphoid cells. Finally, the most labor-intensive model is the BLT mouse, which requires implantation of human fetal liver and thymus pieces under the kidney capsule of NOD-<italic>scid</italic> mice in addition to intravenous HPC injection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>). Immune compartment reconstitution in peripheral blood of BLT mice is very similar to human. However, although signs of primary immune responses were reported in all three of these current mouse models of human immune system reconstitution, the protective value of this immunocompetence and, thus, the potential of these in vivo systems as challenge models for vaccine development against pathogens with exclusive tropism for humans has not been evaluated. Therefore, we analyzed the ability of mice with reconstituted immune system components to exert antigen-specific T cell&#x02013;mediated control of EBV infection and EBV-associated lymphomas.</p><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Immune reconstitution of NOD-scid &#x003b3;<sub>c</sub><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice injected with human CD34<sup>+</sup> HPCs</title><p>To generate mice susceptible to EBV infection and, hence, potentially capable of generating EBV-specific human immune responses in vivo, we compared previously described mouse models for human immune system reconstitution (NOD-<italic>scid</italic> &#x003b3;<sub>c</sub><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and Rag2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> &#x003b3;<sub>c</sub><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>). For this purpose we engrafted irradiated newborn Rag2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> &#x003b3;<sub>c</sub><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and NOD-<italic>scid</italic> &#x003b3;<sub>c</sub><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice with human fetal liver&#x02013;derived CD34<sup>+</sup> HPCs. We observed higher levels of overall reconstitution and, in particular, human T and NK cell reconstitution in NOD-<italic>scid</italic> &#x003b3;<sub>c</sub><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (unpublished data), and therefore pursued this model, which we will refer to as hu-NSG mice in the remainder of the text.</p><p>We consistently achieved reconstitution of 20&#x02013;50 hu-NSG mice from the same graft with similar B and T cell frequencies in peripheral blood by 3 mo (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081720/DC1">Fig. S1 A</ext-link>). Frequencies of human CD45<sup>+</sup> cells routinely exceeded 60% of total splenocytes after 4 mo of reconstitution (Fig. S1 B), with the majority (80&#x02013;90%) being B and T cells (ratios of 2:1 for B to T cells, and 3:2 for CD4<sup>+</sup> to CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells). Additionally, CD123<sup>+</sup> plasmacytoid cells (1&#x02013;2%) and CD11c<sup>+</sup> conventional dendritic cells (1&#x02013;2%), monocytes (3&#x02013;5%), and NK cells (2&#x02013;5%) also engrafted (Fig. S1 B and not depicted). Furthermore, human CD45<sup>+</sup> cells and all major subsets of human immune cells were detected in the thymus, mesenteric lymph node, bone marrow, liver, and lung of hu-NSG mice (unpublished data). Compared with the structured architecture in human secondary lymphoid organs like lymph nodes and tonsils, immune cells in the spleens of hu-NSG mice showed a primitive organization into white and red pulp (Fig. S1 C). In line with previous findings, we therefore successfully achieved human multilineage reconstitution in NOD-<italic>scid</italic> &#x003b3;<sub>c</sub><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice after neonatal HPC transfer, thus generating a small animal model with the potential to generate human immune responses in vivo.</p></sec><sec><title>EBV infection of humanized mice</title><p>To test the reconstituted human immune system's ability to generate pathogen-specific immune control, we infected hu-NSG mice with EBV, an oncogenic human virus that is efficiently controlled by infected individuals with normal immune function. We chose an infectious dose that would approximate the number of virus particles in 100 &#x000b5;l of saliva from a symptomatic EBV converter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>). After injection of hu-NSG mice with 10<sup>5</sup> Raji-infecting units (RIU) of purified viral particles intraperitoneally, EBV-infected cells were readily detectable in the spleen 4 wk after infection by in situ hybridization for EBERs. EBER<sup>+</sup> cells were not detected in mock-infected animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>). At later time points, we also detected EBER<sup>+</sup> cells in the lymph nodes and livers of most infected animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>). In the spleens of infected animals, EBER<sup>+</sup> cells were consistently surrounded by CD3<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>). Furthermore, when EBER<sup>+</sup> cells were detected in nonlymphoid organs such as liver and kidney, these infected cells were again in close proximity to CD3<sup>+</sup> T cells, suggesting that T cells can home to similar peripheral sites as EBV-infected cells in hu-NSG mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>). To characterize the latency type of EBV-infected cells, we stained spleen sections for the two EBV-encoded proteins EBNA2 and LMP1. We did not detect any LMP1 single-positive cells, but we found similar frequencies of EBNA2<sup>+</sup> compared with EBER<sup>+</sup> cells, some of which also expressed LMP1, indicating latency III&#x02013;type EBV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>). These results indicate that hu-NSG mice establish latent EBV infection, which constitutes the basis of B cell transformation by EBV.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>EBV-infected cells are detected in hu-NSG mice in multiple organs and express EBNA2 and LMP1.</bold> (A) EBV-infected cells could be detected in the indicated organs by EBER hybridization.

For this purpose, we first analyzed the splenic lymphocyte composition of the infected animals by flow cytometry. We found dramatic expansions of CD3<sup>+</sup> T cells among the human CD45<sup>+</sup> leukocytes after EBV infection, which correlated with an increase in the percentage of CD8<sup>+</sup> cells among the human T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>). On average, there was a statistically significant twofold expansion of splenic CD3<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in 10 independent experiments with a total of 40 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>). In addition, in both the CD8<sup>+</sup> and the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell compartments, there was a marked-up regulation of HLA-DR and CD45RO surface expression, indicating an activated memory phenotype of the expanded T cells, similar to that seen in humans during symptomatic primary EBV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Expansion of human CD3<sup>+</sup> T cells after EBV infection.</bold> (A) Splenocytes from control or EBV-infected animals were harvested 6 wk after infection.

For this purpose, we first established lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) by in vitro infection of B cells derived from a littermate mouse reconstituted with cells from the same HPC donor used for reconstitution of the EBV-infected animals. B cell&#x02013;depleted splenocytes isolated from control and infected animals were incubated with these autologous LCLs, and IFN-&#x003b3; secretion was monitored by ELISPOT assays. Autologous LCLs stimulated significant amounts of IFN-&#x003b3; production, whereas responses to allogeneic LCLs were comparable to background IFN-&#x003b3; production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, A and B</xref>). Animals infected with higher doses of EBV also developed more vigorous EBV-specific T cell responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>), indicating that T cells can be primed in a dose-dependent manner in hu-NSG mice. Pretreatment of LCLs with antibodies against HLA-A/B/C, HLA-DR/DP/DQ, or both blocked their recognition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref> and not depicted).

Human immune cells and, in particular, human CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells developed in both groups of mice with similar frequencies and distributions (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081720/DC1">Fig. S2 A</ext-link>). Furthermore, transgenic expression of HLA-A2 did not influence homeostatic proliferation and survival of T cells (Fig. S2, B and C). We infected hu-NSG and hu-NSG-A2 mice with EBV, and 5 wk after infection we stimulated splenocytes from these mice with two pools of EBV-derived HLA-A2&#x02013;restricted peptides, one containing 8 lytic epitopes and one containing 12 latent epitopes (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081720/DC1">Table S1</ext-link>). We detected IFN-&#x003b3; secretion by ELISPOT after stimulation with the lytic pool in all five EBV-infected hu-NSG-A2 mice, but only in four out of five mice after stimulation with the latent pool (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 A</xref>). Notably, these latent responses were significantly lower than the lytic responses (11 vs. 70 SFU/2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> cells; P = 0.04). Moreover, no IFN-&#x003b3;&#x02013;secreting cells were detected in any of the control mice or in EBV-infected hu-NSG mice reconstituted with HLA-A2<sup>+</sup> matching (<italic>n</italic> = 2) or nonmatching (<italic>n</italic> = 8) CD34<sup>+</sup> cells against the used peptide pools ex vivo. Interestingly, after stimulation with autologous LCLs, splenocytes from both EBV-infected hu-NSG and hu-NSG-A2 mice responded similarly (107 vs. 124 SFU/2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> cells). To detect EBV-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells directly, splenocytes were stained with control tetramers (HIV GAG<sub>SLY</sub>), and two well-characterized EBV tetramers derived from a lytic epitope (BRLF1<sub>YVL</sub>) and a latent epitope (LMP2<sub>CLG</sub>), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 B</xref>). Although we did not detect any tetramer-positive cells in control hu-NSG and hu-NSG-A2 mice as well as in EBV-infected hu-NSG mice, in three out of five EBV-infected hu-NSG-A2 mice up to 2.7% of the CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells stained positive with the BRLF1<sub>YVL</sub> tetramer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 C</xref>). These tetramer-positive cells had an activated phenotype that was exclusively CD45RO<sup>+</sup>HLA-DR<sup>+</sup> (unpublished data). But, in these mice we also did not observe any cells positive for the LMP2<sub>CLG</sub> tetramer, possibly because their frequency was too low. These experiments suggest that HLA transgenic hu-NSG mice bias primary T cell responses of reconstituted human immune system components toward recognition of EBV-derived peptide epitopes that are dominant during EBV infection in humans.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p><bold>Enhanced priming of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses against dominant EBV peptides in HLA-A2 transgenic hu-NSG mice.</bold> (A) HLA-A2 transgenic and nontransgenic NSG mice were reconstituted with HLA-A2<sup>+</sup> CD34<sup>+</sup> HPCs from the same donor. 4 wk after EBV infection or mock treatment, splenocytes were restimulated for IFN-&#x003b3; ELISPOT assays with medium alone, staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB) as a positive control, the autologous EBV-transformed B cell line (LCLs), 8 lytic EBV antigen&#x02013;derived dominant CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell epitopes, and 12 latent EBV antigen&#x02013;derived CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell epitopes, which had been defined as dominant CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell epitopes in human EBV carriers.

Although we observed small splenic tumors in only 3 out of the 17 EBV-infected animals with or without isotype control antibody injection, all 11 T cell&#x02013;depleted animals developed disseminated EBV-positive tumors in the spleen, mesenteric lymph node, kidney, and/or liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 A</xref>). Histological analysis showed expansion of white pulp regions in the enlarged spleens of T cell&#x02013;depleted and EBV-infected mice, which contained almost exclusively EBER<sup>+</sup> CD20<sup>+</sup> B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 B</xref> and not depicted). Morphologically these proliferations destroyed the underlying architecture of the tissue. They consisted of a polymorphous cell population composed of atypical large transformed cells (some of which resembled Reed-Sternberg variants), plasmacytoid cells, small lymphocytes, and histiocytes. Areas of coagulative necrosis were often also present. Overall, these proliferations resembled the EBV-associated polymorphic lesions seen in bone marrow and solid organ transplant recipients. The majority of these cells expressed EBNA2, once again indicating EBV latency III (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 B</xref>). EBER<sup>+</sup> cells located in the lymph node, liver, and kidney showed a similar phenotype (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081720/DC1">Fig. S4</ext-link> and not depicted). In addition, lytic EBV replication, which was barely detectable during controlled primary EBV infection in vivo, as assessed by immunohistochemical staining for the immediate early EBV antigen BZLF1, was also increased in T cell&#x02013;depleted hu-NSG mice 4 wk after EBV infection (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081720/DC1">Fig. S5</ext-link>). Furthermore, viral DNA loads increased significantly in T cell&#x02013;depleted mice (3.2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> vs. 1.9 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> per 10<sup>6</sup> splenocytes [P = 0.003] and 1.1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>8</sup> vs. 1.6 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7</sup> per spleen [P = 0.04]), indicating uncontrolled EBV infection after T cell depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7, A and B</xref>). Notably, viral loads did not significantly differ between EBV-infected hu-NSG and hu-NSG-A2 mice (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081720/DC1">Fig. S6</ext-link>). To compare the contributions of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells to the T cell&#x02013;mediated immune control of EBV infection, we then depleted T cell subsets separately (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7, C and D</xref>). Viral titers increased significantly both after the depletion of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells compared with EBV-infected animals (EBV, 6.4 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup>; &#x003b1;CD4, 1.9 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup>; &#x003b1;CD8, 3.2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup>; and &#x003b1;CD4+&#x003b1;CD8, 1.3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7</sup> per 10<sup>6</sup> splenocytes [P &#x0003c; 0.03]; and EBV, 1.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7</sup>; &#x003b1;CD4, 7.2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7</sup>; &#x003b1;CD8, 1.2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>8</sup>; and &#x003b1;CD4+&#x003b1;CD8, 8.6 &#x000d7; 10<sup>8</sup> per spleen [P &#x0003c; 0.03]). However, neither the separate depletion of CD4 or CD8 T cells increased the viral titers as much as the depletion of both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in these experiments. Notably, we observed the occurrence of tumors in the spleens and mesenteric lymph nodes in all four pan&#x02013;T cell&#x02013;depleted and in three out of four CD8-depleted animals, but only in one out of four CD4-depleted animals. These results therefore demonstrate that hu-NSG mice are able to prime human EBV-specific T cell responses that protect mice against uncontrolled EBV infection and EBV-associated malignancies. Furthermore, both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells contribute to the successful immune control of EBV in this model.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p><bold>Development of EBV-associated tumors in EBV-infected hu-NSG mice after T cell depletion.</bold> (A) Disseminated tumors in EBV-infected animals after T cell depletion.

Cottontop tamarins were able to prime MHC class II&#x02013;restricted CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells with cytotoxicity against EBV-transformed B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>). In rhesus macaques, strong cytotoxic and IFN-&#x003b3;&#x02013;secreting T cell responses against the monkey virus homologues of the EBNA1 antigen and the immediate early lytic EBV antigen BZLF1 were consistently detected in infected animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>). In BLT mice, EBV infection elicited low levels of IFN-&#x003b3;&#x02013;secreting, HLA-restricted T cell responses against autologous EBV-transformed B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>), and in reconstituted BALB/c Rag2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> &#x003b3;<sub>c</sub><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, T cell proliferation against autologous EBV-transformed B cells was detected after EBV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>). None of these animal models, however, has investigated the protective value of EBV-specific primary T cell responses in vivo, and the level of IFN-&#x003b3;&#x02013;producing EBV-specific T cell responses was also about 5- to 10-fold lower than in the present study. In addition, we report that EBV infection in hu-NSG mice elicited cytotoxic- and epitope-specific primary T cell responses with protective effector functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>).</p><p>These primary immune responses control EBV infection at high levels of viral load, with massive expansion and activation of the CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell compartment. These features are reminiscent of symptomatic primary EBV infection, called infectious mononucleosis (IM). Such a phenotype seems to be even more pronounced in hu-NSG mice, because they carry a 10-fold elevated viral load in their splenocytes, compared with &#x0223c;10<sup>4</sup> viral DNA copies per 10<sup>6</sup> peripheral blood mononuclear cells in IM patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>). Of course, this assumes that the frequency of EBV-infected cells is similar in peripheral blood and spleen during IM, as has been shown for healthy virus carriers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>). Therefore, the reconstituted human immune system in hu-NSG mice has difficulty controlling EBV infection, similar to chronic active EBV infection in bone marrow transplantation recipients. Indeed, approximately 10<sup>5</sup> viral DNA copies per 10<sup>6</sup> peripheral blood mononuclear cells have been observed in &#x0003e;50% of chronic active EBV patients, and these also occasionally develop tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>). Nevertheless, the reconstituted human immune system protects most infected mice from EBV-associated malignancies. In contrast, T cell&#x02013;depleted mice resemble, with their 10-fold increase in EBV viral loads and the dissemination of EBV-induced B cell lymphomas to various tissues, EBV-associated lymphoproliferative disease in transplant recipients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>). In addition, in both immunocompetent and T cell&#x02013;depleted mice, we primarily detect coexpression of EBER, EBNA2, and LMP1 in EBV-infected cells. This indicates latency III&#x02013;type cells, which also form the basis of EBV-associated lymphoproliferative disease in immune-compromised patients. Furthermore, these lesions morphologically resemble those seen in the organ transplant patient population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>). Therefore, EBV-infected hu-NSG mice control EBV infection at high viral loads with hallmarks of IM and develop EBV-associated lymphoproliferative disease after T cell depletion.</p><p>Both CD8<sup>+</sup> and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells contribute to the control of viral infection. In the case of EBV, in vitro studies have demonstrated that CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells mainly kill infected cells, whereas CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells provide help for CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells but can also directly target infected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>). Based on the results of our in vivo experiments, we conclude that CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells contribute to the control of early EBV infection but are not able to restrict viral replication efficiently in the absence of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. However, viral titers are further elevated upon additional depletion of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in addition to CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, suggesting that CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells can mediate some immune control of EBV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). The inability of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells to control EBV infection on their own might reflect the requirement for CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell help during primary EBV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>). This analysis demonstrates the usefulness of our in vivo model, which allows for the first time to dissect protective mechanisms of human lymphocyte compartments in vivo.</p><p>Although we demonstrate protective primary immune responses against EBV in human immune system&#x02013;reconstituted mice, there are several limitations to this model. The most striking is probably the lack of germinal center formation and difficulty in developing efficient as well as class-switched humoral immune responses. Although we found low concentrations of human IgG accumulating in the plasma of reconstituted mice over time, we were unable to detect EBV-specific IgG or IgM responses against the viral capsid antigen in EBV-infected mice (unpublished data). We nevertheless cannot exclude that humoral responses might develop against other EBV antigens and perhaps at later time points of infection, as we have observed for EBNA1 in an experimental vaccine study using the same mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>). Indeed, IgM responses against the lytic EBV antigen BFRF3 were recently reported after 6 wk of EBV infection in a subset of NOD-<italic>scid</italic> &#x003b3;<sub>c</sub><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice with similar reconstitution of human immune compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>). Human B cell responses seem to be weak and slow in their development in hu-NSG mice. In addition, because more restricted expression patterns of EBV latent antigens have only been found in germinal center B cells of healthy virus carriers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>) and because latency I/II tumors are thought to originate from EBV-infected centrocytes or centroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>), the study of EBV-associated Burkitt and Hodgkin lymphomas and T cell responses against these malignancies might be difficult in our model. Latency II tumors, however, have been observed in EBV-infected and human B cell&#x02013;reconstituted NOD-<italic>scid</italic> mice, suggesting that these hosts allow signaling for germinal center formation. Because these mice are unable to reconstitute human T cells after HPC transfer alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>), immunological studies are not possible in this model. Encouragingly, however, latency I/II patterns were recently also described in EBV-infected BALB/c Rag2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> &#x003b3;<sub>c</sub><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice with reconstituted human immune system components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>), suggesting that the mode of EBV infection and/or of the developing EBV-specific immune control might allow different latent EBV infections even in mice with compromised germinal center development. Furthermore, the EBV-specific T cell response in hu-NSG mice seems to favor subdominant EBV-derived peptide epitopes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>), and we were unable to detect T cells of in humans dominant specificities ex vivo. A possible explanation for this might be the suboptimal selection of human T cells and their TCRs on mouse thymic epithelial cells and on human bone marrow&#x02013;derived cells. Even so, others and we have reported that human T cells recognize EBV-infected B cells after EBV infection of hu-NSG mice (this study and reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>), and this recognition can be blocked with antibodies against human MHC molecules, the selection of EBV-specific T cells on human bone marrow&#x02013;derived cells and by H2 molecules on mouse stromal cells seems to favor different affinities and specificities than those observed in humans with matching MHC type. This shortcoming of dominant EBV epitope recognition during infection in NSG mice can be overcome by introducing HLA transgenes, such as HLA-A2 in our case, into this mouse background. Accordingly, we were able to detect latent and lytic EBV antigen&#x02013;specific T cell responses against dominant peptide epitopes from EBV-infected hu-NSG-A2 mice ex vivo. Interestingly and similar to human EBV carriers, lytic EBV-specific T cells were detected with nearly 1 log higher frequencies than latent EBV antigen specificities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>). Therefore, HLA transgenes seem to overcome one of the limitations of human immune responses in hu-NSG mice, and allow this immunocompetent small animal model with human immune system components to develop protective T cell responses against EBV infection with similar specificities to human virus carriers.</p><p>Because EBV-specific T cells are considered to be the cornerstone of immune control against this oncogenic and persistent &#x003b3;-herpesvirus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>), we propose to further characterize the innate and adaptive immune responses that lead to this T cell&#x02013;based immune control. We also plan to evaluate vaccine candidates for eliciting these protective T cell responses against EBV and other pathogens with exclusive tropism for the human hematopoietic lineage.

In blocking experiments, LCL recognition by T cells was blocked by preincubation of the target cells with 10 &#x000b5;g/ml anti&#x02013;HLA-A/B/C (clone W6/32; eBioscience), anti&#x02013;HLA-DR/DP/DQ (clone T&#x000fc;39; BD), and a combination thereof.</p></sec><sec><title>Cloning of peptide- and LCL-specific T cells.</title><p>10 wk after infection, mice were sacrificed and splenocytes were isolated. Cells were then labeled with 0.5 &#x000b5;M CFSE (Invitrogen) and cultured in complete medium containing a library of 33 EBV peptides (1 &#x000b5;M each) or autologous irradiated LCLs at a ratio of 5:1, respectively. On day 6, CFSE<sup>low</sup> CD3<sup>+</sup> cells were sorted by flow cytometry and cloned by limiting dilution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref>). After initial expansion, individual clones were screened by IFN-&#x003b3; ELISPOT assays after restimulation with the library of 33 EBV peptides or autologous irradiated LCLs, respectively. Individual clones that recognized the library were further tested against a matrix of peptide subpools (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref>) to identify the specific cognate peptides.</p></sec><sec><title>Cytotoxicity assay.</title><p>To evaluate the cytotoxic activity of T cell clones against the autologous LCLs, cytotoxicity assays were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref>). In brief, target cells were labeled with PKH26 (Sigma-Aldrich) and incubated with T cell clones at the effector/target ratios. Cells were harvested after 4 h; TO-PRO-3-iodide (Invitrogen), a membrane-impermeable DNA stain, was added to each culture (0.5 &#x000b5;M final concentration); and cells analyzed by flow cytometry. Background and maximum TO-PRO-3-iodide stainings were obtained by incubation of target cells with medium and detergent, respectively. The percent specific lysis was calculated as (% TO-PRO-3-iodide<sup>+</sup>PKH26<sup>+</sup> cells in effector/target cell co-culture &#x02212; TO-PRO-3-iodide<sup>+</sup>PKH26<sup>+</sup> cells in medium)/(% TO-PRO-3-iodide<sup>+</sup>PKH26<sup>+</sup> cells in detergent &#x02212; TO-PRO-3-iodide<sup>+</sup>PKH26<sup>+</sup> cells in medium) &#x000d7; 100%.</p></sec><sec><title>Degranulation assay.</title><p>To characterize the multifunctionality of EBV-specific T cell clones, we stimulated T cell clones at an effector/target ratio of 5:1 with autologous LCLs for 6 h in the presence of anti-CD107 antibody. To detect spontaneous degranulation and cytokine production, a control without LCL was included. After 1 h, 1 &#x000b5;g/ml monensin (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to all samples. At the end of the incubation, cells were fixed, permeabilized, stained with an anti&#x02013;IFN-&#x003b3; antibody, and analyzed by flow cytometry.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis of homeostatic T cell proliferation and survival using 5-ethynyl-2&#x02032;-deoxyuridine (EdU) and annexin-V.</title><p>Reconstituted mice were injected once intraperitoneally with 100 &#x000b5;g EdU and sacrificed 24 h later. For EdU staining, cells were stained first for cell-surface antigens and then analyzed for EdU incorporation using the Click-iT EdU AF488 Cell Proliferation Assay Kit (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instruction. For annexin-V staining, cells were stained first for cell-surface antigens and then stained with annexin-V and 7-AAD using the PE Annexin V Apoptosis Detection Kit (BD) according to the manufacturer's instructions.</p></sec><sec><title>Quantification of EBV viral loads by quantitative real-time PCR.</title><p>Splenic EBV viral DNA load was quantified by real-time PCR using a TaqMan PCR kit and a sequence detector (model 7900; Applied Biosystems). DNA was extracted using the Tissue and Blood DNA kit (QIAGEN) or the Wizard SV Genomic DNA purification system (Promega), according to the manufacturer's protocol. A region from the BamHI W fragment of EBV was amplified using primers 5&#x02032;-GGACCACTGCCCCTGGTATAA-3&#x02032; and 5&#x02032;-TTTGTGTGGACTCCTGGGG-3&#x02032;, and detected with the fluorogenic probe FAM-TCCTGCAGCTATTTCTGGTCGCATCA-TAMRA. The human <italic>bcl-2</italic> gene was amplified using primers 5&#x02032;-CCTGCCCTCCTTCCGC-3&#x02032; and 5&#x02032;-TGCATTTCAGGAAGACCCTGA-3&#x02032;, and detected with the fluorogenic probe FAM-CTTTCTCATGGCTGTCC-TAMRA. The EBV BamHI W fragment copy number per cell was calculated using the formula <italic>N</italic> = 2 &#x000d7; <italic>W</italic>/<italic>B</italic>, where <italic>N</italic> is the EBV BamHI W copy number/cell, <italic>W</italic> is the EBV BamHI W copy number, and <italic>B</italic> is the bcl-2 copy number. All samples were tested in triplicates.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunohistochemistry.</title><p>Immunohistochemical staining was performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections. The antibodies used in this study included CD20 (clone L26), CD8 (clone C8/144B), CD45 (clones 2B11 and PD7/26), CD68 (clone PGM1), EBNA2 (clone PE2), LMP1 (clone CS1-4; Dako), BZLF1 (clone BZ1; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.), CD3 (clone SP7; Thermo Fisher Scientific), CD21 (clone 2G9), and CD56 (ERIC-1; Novocastra). In situ hybridization for EBV was performed using an EBER probe (Vision Biosystems). Double immunohistochemical staining and dual in situ hybridization with immunohistochemical staining was performed using the Bond Max Autostainer (Leica). Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections were deparaffinized, and endogenous peroxidase was inactivated. For the first antibody, antigen retrieval was performed using either the Bond Epitope Retrieval Solution 1 (ER1) or the Bond Epitope Retrieval Solution 2 (ER2) at 99&#x02013;100&#x000b0;C for 20&#x02013;30 min. After retrieval, the sections were incubated sequentially with the primary antibody for 25 min, the postprimary antibody for 15 min, and the polymer for 25 min (Bond Polymer Detection System; Vision Biosystems), followed by colorimetric development with diaminobenzidine (DAB; Vision Biosystems). For the subsequent staining with the second antibody, the sections were heated in either ER1 or ER2 at 99&#x02013;100&#x000b0;C for 20&#x02013;30 min, followed by blocking of endogenous alkaline phosphatase using Dual Endogenous Enzyme Block (Dako). The sections were then sequentially incubated with the second primary antibody, biotinylated link, and streptavidin&#x02013;alkaline phosphatase (LSAB 2 System-AP; Dako) for 25, 15, and 30 min, respectively, followed by red chromagen development with permanent red (Dako). With respect to dual in situ hybridization&#x02013;immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization was performed first according to the manufacturer's instructions (Vision Biosystems) with colorimetric development using DAB, followed by immunostaining as described for the second antibody. Single immunohistochemical staining was performed as described for the first primary antibody.</p></sec><sec><title>Production of GFP-expressing EBV.</title><p>GFP-expressing EBV was produced as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref>). In brief, the EBV lytic cycle was induced in EBV-positive AGS cells by addition of PMA and sodium butyrate. EBV was further purified by ultracentrifugation over a 25% sucrose step gradient and subsequently titered on Raji cells. GFP<sup>+</sup> cells were counted 2 d later and titers were calculated in RIU.</p></sec><sec><title>Tetramer staining.</title><p>To stain CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, soluble tetrameric complexes of HLA-A*0201&#x02013;peptide were produced using the methods of Busch et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref>) with the following peptides: HIV gag aa 77&#x02013;85 (SLYNTVATL), EBV LMP2 aa 426&#x02013;434 (CLGGLLTMV), and EBV BRLF1 aa 109&#x02013;117 (YVLDHLIVV). For staining with these reagents, hu-NSG splenocytes were incubated for 30 min at 37&#x000b0;C with 0.5 &#x000b5;g of HLA-A*0201&#x02013;peptide tetramers (PE-conjugated) and washed. The cells were stained with anti-CD8 mAb conjugated with FITC (BD) for 30 min at 4&#x000b0;C and washed. The samples were analyzed in a flow cytometer.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis.</title><p>Statistical analyses were performed with the paired two-tailed Student <italic>t</italic> test or the Mann-Whitney <italic>U</italic> test, as indicated in the figures.
