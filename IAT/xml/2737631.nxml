With its glycosaminoglycuronan chain, it is responsible for stabilizing inter-fibrillar organization. Type I collagen is the predominant member of the fibrillar collagen family, fulfilling both organizational and structural roles in animal ECMs. In this study, interactions between decoron (the decorin core protein) and binding sites in the d and e<sub>1</sub> bands of the type I collagen fibril were investigated through molecular modeling of their respective X-ray diffraction structures. Previously, it was proposed that a model-based, highly curved concave decoron interacts with a single collagen molecule, which would form extensive van der Waals contacts and give rise to strong non-specific binding. However, the large well-ordered aggregate that is the collagen fibril places significant restraints on modes of ligand binding and necessitates multi-collagen molecular contacts. We present here a relatively high-resolution model of the decoron-fibril collagen complex. We find that the respective crystal structures complement each other well, although it is the monomeric form of decoron that shows the most appropriate shape complementarity with the fibril surface and favorable calculated energies of interaction. One molecule of decoron interacts with four to six collagen molecules, and the binding specificity relies on a large number of hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions, primarily with the collagen motifs KXGDRGE and AKGDRGE (d and e<sub>1</sub> bands). This work helps us to understand collagen-decorin interactions and the molecular architecture of the fibrillar ECM in health and disease.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Shape is arguably one of the most important issues in biology.

On the larger scale, animal shapes are maintained by their connective tissues, or more precisely by connective tissue extracellular matrices (ECMs). The shape and organization of each ECM depends on its collagen content and architecture, other ECM components, and cells being in the right place at the right time. Cells decide where they go, but maintaining their position is an extracellular process and, in an apparent paradox, the particular ECM arrangement helps cells decide what cell type they should be <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007028-Daley1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007028-Perumal1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Collagen fibrils are the main architectural element in tissues such as cartilage, tendon, skin and bones, to which they impart mechanical and tensile strength as well as functioning as an organizational scaffold for the ECM.

In the fibril surface models, most of the strongest electrostatic contacts occur between collagen and the N and C terminal arms in preference to the central LRR's of decoron in the common conformation (in the wide conformation it is the central LRR's that dominate the interaction).

The postulated dissociation scenario is supported by the calculated energies of association of the collagen fibril-decoron complexes versus that of the decoron dimers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007028-g006">Figure 6</xref>). However, a pressing question is how does the same PG that appears relatively resistant to significant changes in curvature bind to such a wide range of fibril diameters: The curvature of the collagen fibril surface changes markedly from the very small (&#x0003c;20 nm) fibrils in developing tissue to the large &#x0003e;250 nm fibrils in aged tissue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007028-Scott3">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. For larger fibril diameters, according to the model of Perumal, Antipova and Orgel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007028-Perumal1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, constructed of straight lattice sections forming a polygon rather than a round cylinder, based partly on observations of large, polygon shaped fibrils in rat tail tendon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007028-Hulmes1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref> and the model of Hulmes et al 1995 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007028-Hulmes2">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>, the problem of decreased curvature is moot. The &#x02018;common&#x02019; model presented here (after Perumal, Antipova and Orgel), has no curvature &#x02013; it is planar. For smaller fibrils where the radius of curvature is relatively large, there is probably greater spacing between adjacent microfibrils at the fibril surface, which might resemble the &#x02018;wide&#x02019; fibril model presented here <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007028-Perumal1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Although providing a weaker attachment than the common model, it is still strong (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007028-g006">Figure 6</xref>). The significant difference between the wide and common binding conformations is in <italic>which</italic> amino acid residues are involved in the interaction and not in how decoron curvature changes to accommodate a tightly curved small fibril. Again, decoron shows redundancy in this respect; although the involvement of LRRs 4 and 10 remains consistent in both models, their relative contributions of the strength of polar interactions is not equivalent (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007028.s003">Table S1</xref>). The ligand-receptor interaction is facilitated by the establishment of a much broader hydrogen bonding network than previously envisioned &#x02013; one that covers a large part of the concave surface and the terminal &#x02018;thumb&#x02019; and &#x02018;finger&#x02019; (N and C ends). Although the significance of collagen binding primarily with 2&#x02013;3 decoron LRR's might appear diminished by these data, it is clear that the potential interaction between particular LRR's and collagen may be very strong (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007028-g003">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007028.s003">Table S1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Decorins Elasticity is in its AGAG chain, strongly anchored by the protein core</title><p>Elasticity is fundamental to the functioning of ECMs, to provide reversible deformation during use.

Although highly ordered, the type I fibril surface packing conformation must occasionally deviate marginally from the &#x02018;average&#x02019; crystallographic packing structure within each group of 4 microfibrils in both the lateral and axial planes, specifically:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>&#x02018;disorder&#x02019; determined variation in the lateral plane: There are thermal or glass-like state variations from the &#x02018;ideal&#x02019; packing lattice in the order of &#x0002b;/&#x02212; 0.31 nm in parts of the gap region <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007028-Orgel1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>, which were accounted for in the model of Perumal, Antiopva and Orgel 2008 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007028-Perumal1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. This suggests that there may be regions on the surface of the fibril where the central two collagen monomers (molecules) dock with the concave surface of the decoron molecule are as much as 0.6 nm apart, but would not move more than 0.3 nm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007028-Orgel1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref> closer to another collagen monomer from its &#x02018;ideal&#x02019; position. We have modeled here just such an average maximum displacement packing model and termed it &#x0201c;wide&#x0201d; due to the increased distance between the collagen monomers neighboring the central two monomers in contact with decoron's concave surface, providing more space for docking decorons N and C terminal &#x02018;arms&#x02019;. The &#x0201c;common&#x0201d; conformation, which represents the intrinsically normalized crystal structure, likely represents the predominant state of packing at the fibril surface. However, we recognize that there is likely to be a continuum of packing arrangements between common and wide states, albeit highly biased towards the common conformation &#x02013; or else the collagen fibril lattice could not be crystalline by definition.</p></list-item><list-item><p>non-disordered variation between <italic>e</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>d</italic> band binding sites (axial plane) is accounted for simply from the microfibrillar structure: The collagen monomers are <italic>not</italic> &#x02018;straight-rods&#x0201d; in the gap region.

Despite the fact that a single microfibril lacks the proper context and model stringency, amongst the highest ranked docking alternatives from this approach were those two binding configurations that the fibril surface allows (Dec N&#x02192;C or Dec C&#x02192;N). For consistency, these same docking orientations were reproduced for each &#x0201c;receptor-ligand&#x0201d; model, where the &#x0201c;receptor&#x0201d; was: a microfibril (or more specifically the part of monomer 4 found in the <italic>d</italic> and <italic>e</italic><sub>1</sub> bands, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007028-g001">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007028-g002">2</xref>); two side by side microfibrils (representing a minimal fibril surface model with only the decoron concave facing collagen molecules), the common fibril conformation, or the wide fibril conformation for both the <italic>d</italic> and <italic>e</italic><sub>1</sub> band sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007028-g002">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007028-g003">3</xref>). The &#x0201c;ligand&#x0201d; models for each receptor model were: a decoron monomer or decoron dimer, in the Dec N&#x02192;C or Dec C&#x02192;N orientation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007028-g001">Figures 1</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007028-g002"/><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007028-g003">3</xref>). The term &#x0201c;receptor&#x0201d; is used in this context in the main text.</p><p>Each decoron model was manually docked to within 5 &#x000c5; of each collagen binding site on the different receptor surfaces. The geometry of the receptor site ensured that two collagen monomers faced the concave interior of decorin (except for the single microfibril models that lacked the second monomer contact). The fibril surface models had in addition to the concave binding monomers, two to four monomers in position to contact the N and C-terminal tips of the decoron arms. Each model was then allowed to energy-minimize for at least 25,000 steps or until no further minimization occurred (whichever came last) with the collagen monomers set as rigid bodies, fixed in place. Following this step, the minimization was allowed to proceed a further 10,000&#x02013;20,000 steps whilst allowing all atoms within 10 &#x000c5; of the decoron molecule/s to relax.
