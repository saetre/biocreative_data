This fish mt genome, consisting of 16558 base-pairs, encodes genes for 13 proteins, two rRNAs, and 22 tRNAs, in addition to a regulatory sequence for replication and transcription (D-loop), is similar to those of the other vertebrates in both the order and orientation of these genes. The protein-coding and ribosomal RNA genes are highly homologous both in size and composition, to their counterparts in mammals, birds, amphibians, and invertebrates, and using essentially the same set of codons, including both the initiation and termination signals, and the tRNAs. Differences do exist, however, in the lengths and sequences of the D-loop regions, and in space between genes, which account for the variations in total lengths of the genomes. Our observations provide evidence for the first time for the conservation of genetic information in the fish mitochondrial genome, especially among the vertebrates.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00229-0151.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4853"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00229-0152.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4854"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00229-0153.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4855"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00229-0154.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4856"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00229-0155.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4857"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00229-0156.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4858"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
