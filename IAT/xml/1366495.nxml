Here, we use an integrated genetic, genomic, and computational strategy to comprehensively determine the molecular identities of distinct myoblast subpopulations within the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryonic mesoderm at the time that cell fates are initially specified. A compendium of gene expression profiles was generated for primary mesodermal cells purified by flow cytometry from appropriately staged wild-type embryos and from 12 genotypes in which myogenesis was selectively and predictably perturbed. A statistical meta-analysis of these pooled datasets&#x02014;based on expected trends in gene expression and on the relative contribution of each genotype to the detection of known muscle genes&#x02014;provisionally assigned hundreds of differentially expressed genes to particular myoblast subtypes. Whole embryo in situ hybridizations were then used to validate the majority of these predictions, thereby enabling true-positive detection rates to be estimated for the microarray data. This combined analysis reveals that myoblasts exhibit much greater gene expression heterogeneity and overall complexity than was previously appreciated. Moreover, it implicates the involvement of large numbers of uncharacterized, differentially expressed genes in myogenic specification and subsequent morphogenesis. These findings also underscore a requirement for considerable regulatory specificity for generating diverse myoblast identities. Finally, to illustrate how the developmental functions of newly identified myoblast genes can be efficiently surveyed, a rapid RNA interference assay that can be scored in living embryos was developed and applied to selected genes. This integrated strategy for examining embryonic gene expression and function provides a substantially expanded framework for further studies of this model developmental system.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="synopsis"><title>Synopsis</title><p>Animal development requires cells in complex organs to acquire distinct identities. During the development of the body wall musculature of the fruit fly, a pool of apparently identical cells gives rise to two types of muscle precursors, both of which are required for the appearance of functioning muscles. These identities depend on broad programs of gene expression. The authors attempt to dissect the complements of expressed genes that define these two different cell types by integrating modern methods in genetics, genomics, and informatics. By purifying informative cells from normal embryos and mutants that perturb muscle development, assaying their genomewide gene expression programs, and combining experiments statistically, they have identified fivefold more founder-specific genes than were previously suspected to characterize this cell type. The expression patterns of hundreds of genes were examined in whole embryos to test the statistical predictions, permitting the authors to estimate how many more cell type&#x02013;specific genes remain to be discovered. Finally, dozens of the genes highlighted by these methods were tested for direct involvement in muscle development, and several new players in this process are reported. The integrated strategy used here can be generalized for studying genetic programs in other complex tissues.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>Citation:</meta-name><meta-value>Estrada B, Choe SE, Gisselbrecht SS, Michaud S, Raj L, et al.

Thus, detailed knowledge of the genes that are spatially and temporally coexpressed at the cellular level in a particular developmental context will not only provide insight into the logic of transcriptional networks but also define the downstream effectors of morphogenesis. Given the cellular diversity present in most tissues, it would be ideal to derive the entire genetic program of each individual cell type and to determine the response of each differentially expressed gene to perturbations of the pathways that regulate formation of that organ. Defining such cell-specific gene expression signatures and mapping the sequential steps involved in their generation are both essential to achieving a systems-level view of development &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020016-b003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020016-b004">4</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Traditional studies have monitored only one or a few cell-type specific markers at a time using different genetic backgrounds to perturb the developmental process of interest.

However, to test the generality of hypotheses derived from the study of small numbers of genes, it is essential to acquire a comprehensive assessment of the gene expression changes occurring in response to a known set of developmental regulators.</p><p>Elaborating an integrated and systematic experimental approach to identify and functionally characterize such genes and their <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory sequences in a metazoan model organism remains a significant and largely unsolved challenge. In yeast, pooled expression profiles derived for multiple genotypes and chemical treatments have proved extremely valuable for dissecting biological pathways &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020016-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d;. In principle, it should be possible to generate equally illuminating expression profile compendia for the development of multicellular organisms.

Each FC possesses a unique identity and seeds the formation of an individual myotube by fusing with the more homogeneous population of FCMs. Of the known early muscle-specific genes, some are specific to only one myoblast type, while others are expressed in both. Many of these genes encode transcription factors that are essential for myoblast specification &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020016-b011">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020016-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;.

Wingless (Wg, a Wnt family member) and Decapentaplegic (Dpp, a member of the bone morphogenetic protein superfamily) first cooperate to render a large domain of mesodermal cells competent to respond to a subsequent inductive signal mediated by two receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), an epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (EGFR) and the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) receptor (FGFR) encoded by <italic>heartless (htl).</italic> Localized RTK activation within the competence domain stimulates the Ras pathway and the formation of Eve-expressing equivalence groups &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020016-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;.

Thus, distinct myoblast identity codes are generated by the combinatorial functions of Wg, Dpp, EGF, FGF, and Notch signals. These signaling codes are in turn mirrored in transcriptional codes that induce the changes in gene expression that are characteristic of individual FCs and FCMs. Collectively, this knowledge provides the logical foundation for genomic and computational investigations of muscle gene transcriptional regulation in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo.</p><p>Gene expression profiling of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryonic mesoderm has been undertaken in several prior studies. In one approach, mutations in early dorsoventral patterning genes were used to eliminate or overproduce mesodermal cells, and genes whose expression is enriched in the mesoderm were identified by microarray analysis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020016-b014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020016-b027">27</xref>&#x0005d;. A modification of this approach in which the Ras or Notch pathway was constitutively activated in a <italic>Toll<sup>10b</sup></italic> mutant&#x02014;a genetic background that drastically disrupts gastrulation and converts the entire embryo to mesoderm&#x02014;led to the identification of a small number of genes that are specific to FCs or FCMs &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020016-b028">28</xref>&#x0005d;. However, the latter study was limited by several factors, including the complete lack of inductive ectoderm and its differentiated derivatives in <italic>Toll<sup>10b</sup></italic> embryos, the absence of Dpp in these embryos, the disruption of normal cellular interactions within the overproduced mesoderm, independent validation of only a few microarray predictions so that a true-positive detection rate could not be reliably estimated, and the use of a cDNA microarray that represented only 40&#x00025; of the genes in the entire <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome. It is likely, therefore, that many more FC and FCM genes remain to be discovered.</p><p>To address this question, we designed a different strategy for analyzing cell type&#x02013;specific genetic programs for a complex tissue that circumvents the previously encountered difficulties and is more generally applicable. This approach integrates genetic perturbations of development, purification of primary embryonic cells of interest, microarray-based genomewide transcriptional profiling, statistical meta-analysis of the pooled gene expression datasets, and large-scale validation by in situ hybridization of gene expression patterns predicted by the computational analysis. Applying this strategy, we identified and validated several hundred genes that are uniquely expressed in FCs, FCMs, or both myoblast types. Finally, we used in vivo RNA interference (RNAi) to rapidly assess the myogenic functions of several newly identified myoblast genes. In a separate but complementary effort, information derived from the present studies was applied to a new computational method for analyzing the relative contribution of individual transcription factor binding sites to combinatorial transcriptional codes (A. A. Philippakis, B. Busser, S. S. Gisselbrecht, F. S. He, B. Estrada, A. M. Michelson, and M. L. Bulyk, unpublished data). Taken together, the systematic strategy used here provides significant new insights into embryonic myogenesis and represents an integrated experimental framework that can be applied to related investigations in other developmental contexts.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Purification of Mesodermal Cells by Flow Cytometry</title><p>To increase the sensitivity of detecting myoblast transcripts in microarray expression profiling experiments, we first developed a method to purify both wild-type and mutant cells of interest from whole <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos.

We used the binary nature of this expression system to target GFP not only in a tissue-specific manner but also such that only mutant cells would be labeled for any loss-of-function genotype. This goal was accomplished by recombining the <italic>twi</italic>-<italic>Gal4</italic> construct onto a selected mutant chromosome in one strain and the UAS-<italic>GFP</italic> reporter onto the same mutant chromosome in a second strain. Crossing these two strains results in GFP expression only in mutant mesodermal cells; neither wild-type mesoderm nor mutant nonmesodermal cells express GFP in progeny embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020016-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). Similarly, it is possible to introduce a second UAS transgene that encodes a constitutively activated or dominant negative form of a signal transduction component or transcription factor as another means of perturbing normal development &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020016-b019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020016-b024">24</xref>&#x0005d;.

Combining these results with data from the literature, we calculated a true-positive detection rate of 95.3&#x00025; for genes enriched in GFP-expressing cells.

In the few examples studied at single cell resolution, the RTK/Ras pathway was found to induce FC identities, whereas Notch had a similar function for FCMs &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020016-b014">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020016-b016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020016-b018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020016-b019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020016-b031">31</xref>&#x0005d;. To assess whether these two signals are differentially involved in the specification of all somatic myoblasts, we used a <italic>dumbfounded (duf)</italic> enhancer trap line as a global FC marker &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020016-b032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020016-b033">33</xref>&#x0005d;, and an antibody directed against Lmd as a marker of all FCMs &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020016-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020016-g002">Figure 2</xref>C). Mesodermal expression of either constitutively activated EGFR or FGFR had the same effect: FCs were markedly overproduced at the expense of FCMs in all regions of the somatic mesoderm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020016-g002">Figure 2</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020016-g002">2</xref>E). Conversely, Notch activation blocked formation of most, if not all, FCs, with either no effect or perhaps a slight increase in FCMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020016-g002">Figure 2</xref>F). Thus, the EGFR/FGFR and Notch pathways have opposing effects on the determination of virtually all FCs and FCMs. Given these results, we predicted that loss- and gain-of-function genetic manipulations of these pathways would generate global changes in myoblast-specific gene expression, as indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020016-g002">Figure 2</xref>B, and that these patterns should facilitate the rapid categorization of FC and FCM genes on a genomewide scale.</p><p>A compendium of gene expression profiles specifically targeted to muscle development was generated for mesodermal cells purified from 12 genetic backgrounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020016-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). A meta-analysis was then designed to optimize the assignment of genes to one or the other myoblast category based on each gene's collective behavior in the expression profile compendium. For example, any gene that is upregulated relative to wild-type in RTK/Ras, Dpp, or Wg pathway-activating conditions, upregulated in a <italic>Dl</italic> mutant, downregulated with Notch activation, and downregulated in a <italic>wg</italic> mutant should have a high probability of being expressed in muscle FCs. Of note, any one genotype alone detected less than 40&#x00025; of known FC genes and less than 30&#x00025; of known FCM genes (at q &#x0003d; 0.01; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020016-g003">Figure 3</xref>A), suggesting that many more genes that are specifically transcribed in each of these cell types remain to be identified. We therefore factored into the meta-analysis not only the expected trends in gene expression for each genetic manipulation but also a weight factor that reflects the relative contribution of each genotype to the detection of known myoblast-specific genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020016-sd001">Protocol S1</xref>, Analysis Method E).</p><p>To score the genes with respect to FC- or FCM-like expression response, we used a statistical metric (&#x0201c;T&#x0201d;) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020016-b034">34</xref>&#x0005d;, which is a weighted sum of the <italic>t</italic>-statistics from each genotype versus wild-type comparison (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020016-sd001">Protocol S1</xref>, Analysis Method E).

We also were able to assign significance level estimates to the T-scores by applying random permutations to the expression datasets.

Of 213 randomly selected genes from among the top-ranked 373 FC candidates, 118 (55&#x00025;) were validated as authentic FC genes, that is, actually expressed in founder cells by embryonic in situ hybridizations in the above-mentioned genetic backgrounds. When 123 of the predicted 276 FCM genes were similarly examined by in situ hybridization, 18 (15&#x00025;) were found to have FCM-specific expression patterns, while an additional 40 (33&#x00025;) were found to be expressed in both FCs and FCMs. Taken together, these findings suggest that, while FC gene predictions derived from the present experimental design are very accurate, the hypothesized specificity of the genetic manipulations for FCM genes is confounded by genes that are expressed in both myoblast types. Of note, this conclusion could only be derived from the large-scale in situ hybridization data obtained here, experiments that have not frequently been undertaken in other transcriptional profiling studies to validate microarray results.

First, isolating the tissue of interest&#x02014;even without purifying individual cell populations&#x02014;substantially increases the sensitivity of microarray experiments. Second, perturbation of multiple convergent pathways significantly augments both the statistical and biological power of the microarray compendium to resolve cell-specific expression patterns. While independent replicas of the same genotype yield statistical power, use of multiple genotypes has the additional benefit of reducing systematic biases that may be associated with a single genetic manipulation. Indeed, we found that different genotypes have distinct capacities to detect FC versus FCM genes, suggesting that perturbing multiple pathways is a more effective means to query diverse cell types present in the isolated tissue. For instance, the overall sensitivity of the approach is reflected in the high FC meta-analysis rank obtained for <italic>eve</italic> (108), even though it is expressed in less than 1&#x00025; of mesodermal cells.</p><p>Purification of specific cells and the inclusion of multiple informative genotypes in the acquisition of genomewide expression data for a particular tissue&#x02014;what we have termed a targeted expression profile compendium&#x02014;provide additional information that has not been available from prior genomic studies of mesoderm development &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020016-b014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020016-b027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020016-b028">28</xref>&#x0005d;.

Several important differences in experimental design can account for the disparate outcomes of the two approaches, including use of different numbers of genetic perturbations of FC and FCM development (two in the previous study versus 12 here), different microarray platforms representing dissimilar fractions of the genome, and the absence of Dpp as an FC determining signal in the embryos used in the earlier study &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020016-b028">28</xref>&#x0005d;. In this regard, we found that Dpp contributes significantly to FC gene identification, so its inclusion in any experimental analysis of muscle development appears to be critical.</p><p>Our findings emphasize the importance of independently validating microarray data and computational predictions of genes expressed in different cell populations. Whereas whole embryo in situ hybridizations revealed that the FC gene prediction rate was very high, the fraction of true positive FCM genes was considerably smaller when the same datasets were analyzed using a similar rationale and statistical methods. The in situ hybridization results further demonstrated that the observed difference in the accuracy of FC and FCM gene prediction rates is largely attributable to an unanticipated number of genes expressed in both myoblast types that, from the microarray data analysis alone, were incorrectly scored as FCM-specific genes. This last outcome most likely occurred because transcripts expressed in both FCs and FCMs followed an FCM-specific pattern in the genetic perturbation and microarray experiments owing to the fact that FCMs greatly outnumber FCs in the purified cell fraction. This issue notwithstanding, the integrated approach we used facilitated the efficient identification of several hundred genes having different myoblast-specific expression patterns while entailing quite manageable false positive detection rates.</p><p>The transcriptional profiling strategy elaborated here offers an information-rich approach that can be applied to other model organisms and developmental processes. Indeed, because the present experiments employed a general mesodermal <italic>Gal4</italic> driver, the existing compendium of expression profiles should be applicable to mesodermal derivatives other than somatic muscle. Consistent with this expectation, a preliminary meta-analysis using a relevant subset of the present data was effective in predicting genes with cardiac expression (SEC and AMM, unpublished results). The sensitivity and specificity of these analyses can be further optimized by using the most appropriate combination of mutants, and by selectively targeting GFP for cell purification. Perhaps most important, the collective expression data obtained from such experiments provide vast amounts of information about the various regulatory inputs to each identified gene and allow detailed molecular signatures to be derived for specific cells within a complex tissue.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Unanticipated Complexity of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Muscle Regulatory Network</title><p>Muscle FCs are specified by the convergent inputs of multiple intercellular signals &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020016-b010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020016-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;.

For example, although transcription of most FCM genes requires <italic>lmd,</italic> others are entirely <italic>lmd</italic> independent. Still other FCM genes exhibit regional differences in their responses to perturbations of Ras and Notch signaling, while some <italic>lmd</italic>-dependent genes are not expressed in all FCMs in which Lmd is found. Finally, a subset of FCM genes is differentially controlled by Ras, Notch, and Lmd in the somatic and visceral subdivisions of the mesoderm, even though both types of muscle arise through fusion of similar myoblasts &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020016-b057">57</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>FCs and FCMs were found to have gene expression signatures comprising large numbers of unique genes, as well as numerous shared transcripts. Whereas transcription factors, signal transduction components, and adhesion molecules are overrepresented in FCs, proteins associated with metabolic functions predominate in both myoblast classes. The prominent expression of regulatory genes in FCs is in agreement with prior evidence that these myoblasts contain specific determinants of muscle identity &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020016-b018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020016-b042">42</xref>&#x0005d; and suggests that cell fusion plays an important role in the acquisition of unique genetic programs by individual myotubes.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Functions of Newly Identified Myoblast Genes</title><p>The specific functions of each myoblast type are further emphasized by our RNAi results. For example, <italic>sola</italic>&#x02014;which encodes the <italic>Drosophila</italic> homolog of verprolin, an actin binding protein&#x02014;is expressed only in FCMs and is essential for myoblast fusion. Moreover, profilin, another actin binding protein encoded by <italic>chic</italic> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020016-b048">48</xref>&#x0005d;, is also restricted to FCMs. These findings imply a different function or mode of regulation of the actin cytoskeleton in FCMs as opposed to FCs during fusion. While the cytoskeleton has previously been implicated in myotube formation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020016-b058">58</xref>&#x0005d;, an asymmetrically expressed cytoskeletal component has not been uncovered, further highlighting the unique nature of the cytoskeleton in these myoblasts. In contrast, RNAi directed against the FC-specific gene <italic>suel</italic>/CG17492 causes an early myospheroid phenotype in a subset of muscles, suggesting a defect in myotube pathfinding and/or in formation of stable epidermal attachments, functions characteristic of FCs &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020016-b042">42</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Although whole-genome RNAi screens have proved to be highly informative for <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. elegans</named-content> and for cultured cells where efficient dsRNA delivery methods are available &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020016-b059">59</xref>&#x0005d;, they are technically much more difficult to apply to <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos. Restricting a whole embryo RNAi screen to a list of genes having tissue-specific expression patterns offers a more efficient approach to such functional discovery. This concept can also be applied to large-scale RNAi analysis of mouse embryonic development.</p><p>The experimental strategy presented here has provided substantial insight into the complexity of components involved in muscle development in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo. Many of our conclusions could only be drawn by examining the large, interrelated datasets that comprise a targeted expression profile compendium. Other findings are derived from more traditional studies of single genes that nevertheless depended on genomewide approaches for their identification. Further analysis of our existing results, and expansion of this database by performing similar experiments with additional informative genotypes and with smaller subsets of purified cells, should yield even greater knowledge of the architecture and function of the myogenic network. Furthermore, application of this integrated set of approaches in other developmental contexts, both in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and in other model organisms, can offer a systems-level view of cell fate specification and morphogenesis that provides a wealth of hypotheses for further testing by genetic and biochemical methods.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Fly strains and genetics.</title><p>The following <italic>Drosophila</italic> stocks were used to obtain both wild-type and genetically modified mesodermal cells expressing GFP: <italic>twi</italic>-<italic>Gal4</italic> UAS-2<italic>EGFP</italic> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020016-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d;, UAS-&#x003bb;<italic>top</italic> (constitutively activated EGFR) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020016-b060">60</xref>&#x0005d;, UAS-<italic>dof</italic> UAS-&#x003bb;-<italic>htl</italic> (constitutively activated Heartless FGFR together with Downstream of FGFR/Heartbroken/Stumps) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020016-b061">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020016-b062">62</xref>&#x0005d;, UAS-<italic>Ras1<sup>Act</sup></italic> (activated Ras) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020016-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;, UAS-<italic>pnt<sup>P2VP16</sup></italic> (activated Pointed) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020016-b024">24</xref>&#x0005d;, UAS-<italic>tkv<sup>QD</sup></italic> (activated Thick veins) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020016-b063">63</xref>&#x0005d;, UAS-<italic>arm<sup>s10</sup></italic> (activated Armadillo)&#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020016-b064">64</xref>&#x0005d;, UAS-<italic>arm<sup>s10</sup>;</italic> UAS-<italic>Ras1<sup>Act</sup>,</italic> SG24 <italic>wg<sup>CX4</sup></italic>/<italic>CyO, wg<sup>IG22</sup></italic> UAS-2<italic>EGFP,</italic> UAS-<italic>N<sup>intra</sup></italic> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020016-b065">65</xref>&#x0005d;, <italic>twi</italic>-<italic>Gal4 lmd<sup>1</sup></italic>/<italic>TM3 ftz-lacZ,</italic> UAS-2<italic>EGFP lmd<sup>2</sup>/TM3 ftz-lacZ, twi</italic>-<italic>Gal4 Dl</italic><sup>X</sup>/TM3 <italic>ftz-lacZ,</italic> and UAS-2<italic>EGFP Dl</italic><sup>X</sup>/<italic>TM3 ftz-lacZ</italic>.
