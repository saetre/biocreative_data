Our aim was to determine p70S6K and PI3K/mTOR/p70S6K pathway dependent gene expression profiles by microarrays using five breast cancer cell lines with predefined gene copy number and gene expression alterations.

The overexpression of p70S6K is associated with aggressive disease and poor prognosis of breast cancer patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. p70S6 kinase is located downstream of PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, which is activated by HER2 receptors, insulin-like growth factor receptor and estrogen receptor in breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. p70S6K itself is activated by 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK-1) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) kinase. p70S6 kinase regulates protein synthesis by activating 40S ribosomal protein S6, leading to an increased rate of translation of the class of 5'TOP (5' <underline>t</underline>erminal <underline>o</underline>ligo<underline>p</underline>yrimide) mRNA transcripts. These transcripts encode critical components of the cellular translational machinery, thus promoting protein synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Additionally, p70S6K has a crucial role in cell growth by regulating cell size and progression of cell cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Recently, p70S6K has been reported to inactivate the pro-apoptotic molecule BAD by phosphorylation, thereby also promoting cell survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway is often activated in cancer due to genetic alterations of the genes implicated in this pathway. For example, <italic>PIK3CA</italic>, <italic>PTEN</italic>, <italic>TSC1/2</italic>, <italic>HER2</italic>, <italic>AKT</italic>, and <italic>PDPK1 </italic>have been found to be frequently mutated or amplified in cancer and thereby PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway is an attractive target for therapeutics. In clinical trials, there are a number of drugs that target proteins involved in this pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. For example, flavonoid derivative Ly294002 is a PI3K inhibitor that acts in the ATP-binding site of PI3K enzyme and targets the PI3K/AKT axis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Rapamycin is an immunosuppressant and a potential clinical drug that inhibits mTOR by binding to the phosphatidic acid-binding site required for mTOR activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Thus, mTOR cannot phosphorylate p70S6 kinase resulting in G1 arrest of the cell cycle and suppression of protein synthesis. Despite the fact that PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway contains many putative therapeutic targets, the clinical trials with the pathway-specific drugs have not been as promising as previously thought. This might be due to the cross-talk of PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway with multiple other signalling pathways leading to multiple sites of regulation. Similarly, the diversity of genetic aberrations activating this pathway is likely to cause differences in drug responses.</p><p>Our aim was to identify genes that are transcriptionally altered due to PI3K/mTOR/p70S6K pathway inhibition in breast cancer cells using RNAi and small molecule inhibitors. p70S6K encoded by <italic>RPS6KB1 </italic>was knocked down using three different siRNAs in BT-474 and MCF-7 breast cancer cell lines, since these cell lines show high-level amplification and overexpression of <italic>RPS6KB1</italic>. Ly294002 and rapamycin are known to target PI3K/mTOR pathway upstream of p70S6K. Therefore, breast cancer cell lines BT-474, MCF-7, MDA-361, MDA-436 and SK-BR-3 were treated with these inhibitors to compare transcriptional signatures responsive to both <italic>RPS6KB1 </italic>and PI3K/mTOR pathway inhibitions. Our results show for the first time the genome-wide transcriptional consequences of PI3K/mTOR pathway and <italic>RPS6KB1 </italic>inhibitions in breast cancer, suggesting novel downstream targets for PI3K/mTOR pathway and p70S6 kinase.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>p70S6K suppression induces specific gene expression alterations</title><p>To identify downstream targets of p70S6K in breast cancer cells, we first examined gene expression alterations in <italic>RPS6KB1</italic>-suppressed BT-474 and MCF-7 breast cancer cell lines that normally show high-level expression of p70S6K. We used three different siRNAs to knock-down the expression of <italic>RPS6KB1 </italic>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Based on the microarray analyses, the signal log10 ratio with siRNA 1 was -0.5, resulting in 70% relative downregulation of <italic>RPS6KB1 </italic>mRNA, whereas with <italic>RPS6KB1 </italic>siRNAs 2 and 3 log10 ratios were -0.3 &#x02013; -0.5 with different probes representing <italic>RPS6KB1</italic>, indicating 50&#x02013;70% relative suppression with these two siRNAs. The signal log10 ratios of all the genes representing their mRNA expression levels are available at CanGEM (please see Availability &#x00026; requirements for more information). The <italic>RPS6KB1 </italic>knock-down also caused significant decrease in p70S6K protein expression after 72 hours in both cell lines (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Interfering the PI3K/mTOR/p70S6K signaling pathway</bold>.

Of these differentially expressed genes, 68 genes (39&#x02013;62%) were commonly down- or up-regulated in both cell lines including <italic>RPS6KB1</italic>, <italic>ABL1</italic>, <italic>PPP1R12B</italic>, <italic>PRKCQ</italic>, and <italic>STK32B </italic>[see Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>]. Sixty-nine genes (63%) were down- or up-regulated in BT-474 with all three siRNAs, whereas ninety-one genes (53%) were differentially expressed with all siRNAs in MCF-7. From these, 45 genes were differentially expressed with all siRNAs in both of the breast cancer cell lines [see Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Rapamycin and Ly294002 block Thr389 phosphorylation of p70S6K</title><p>To further study the downstream targets of PI3K/mTOR pathway, five breast cancer cell lines BT-474, MCF-7, MDA-361, MDA-436 and SK-BR-3 were treated with PI3K inhibitor Ly294002 and mTOR inhibitor rapamycin (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). We first evaluated the phosphorylation status of p70S6K after inhibitor treatments by Western blotting. Previously, we have shown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] that MCF-7, BT-474 and MDA-361 breast cancer cell lines have p70S6K amplification and protein overexpression, whereas SK-BR-3 show normal copy number and protein expression levels of p70S6K. After the inhibitor treatments with Ly294002 and rapamycin, significantly lower or no protein expression of Thr389-phosphorylated p70S6K was detected by Western blotting in all the rapamycin- and Ly294002-treated breast cancer cell lines as compared to non-treated samples (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A&#x02013;B</xref>). Our results indicate that rapamycin and Ly294002 blocked phosphorylation of Thr389, one of the amino acids essential for p70S6K activation. The total p70S6K levels were higher in MCF-7, MDA-361 and BT-474 breast cancer cell lines as compared to that of SK-BR-3 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A&#x02013;B</xref>).

SOM analysis was performed in order to detect the overall gene expression alterations in five inhibitor-treated breast cancer cell lines. In 24 h and 48 h time point treatments, 537 and 577 genes were differentially expressed in Ly294002-treated cells and 538 and 523 genes were differentially expressed in rapamycin-treated cells, respectively [see Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>]. Altogether, 38% of the differentially expressed genes were altered in both the Ly294002 and rapamycin treatments at 24 h time point. Additionally, several genes associated with PI3K/mTOR pathway were altered at the transcriptional level [see Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>]. For example, <italic>AKT1</italic>, <italic>FRAP1, EIF4E, EIF4G1, EIF4A1 </italic>and <italic>EIF4A2 </italic>were transcriptionally altered in several inhibitor-treated cell lines but not in cell lines treated with siRNAs targeting <italic>RPS6KB1 </italic>[see Additional Files <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>]. The protein expression of three of these genes, <italic>AKT1</italic>, <italic>FRAP1 </italic>and <italic>EIF4G1 </italic>(encoding AKT, mTOR and eIF4G1, respectively), were detected by Western immunoblotting and eIF4G1 showed downregulation at protein level by both rapamycin and Ly294002 treatments (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A&#x02013;B</xref>). To evaluate the biological responses to PI3K/mTOR pathway inhibitors, cell cycle and apoptosis assays were performed for inhibitor-treated breast cancer cell lines. Ly294002 treatment caused apoptosis in BT-474 and MDA-361 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A&#x02013;B</xref>) and G1 arrest of the cell cycle in MCF-7 and SK-BR-3 breast cancer cell lines [see Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>]. Rapamycin arrested cells in G1 phase in three cell lines (MCF-7, BT-474 and MDA-361) after 24 h or 48 h treatment [see Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>] without inducing apoptosis in any of the cell lines (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A&#x02013;B</xref>).

Altogether, the inhibition of PI3K and mTOR in BT-474 and MCF-7 cells by Ly294002 and rapamycin led to differential expression of a higher number of genes than with <italic>RPS6KB1 </italic>siRNAs [see Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>]. The number of differentially expressed genes after Ly294002 treatment was 530, whereas after rapamycin treatment it was 117.

with similar mechanism of action</title><p>We then explored which gene ontology classes were enriched in gene expression profiles of five Ly294002- and rapamycin-treated breast cancer cell lines [see Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5</xref>] by using Gene Ontology Categorizer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Among the twenty relatively most enriched GO classes in Ly294002-treated cell lines were functional categories involved in cell killing, mitosis, and G1 phase of the cell cycle. In rapamycin treatment, these included functional categories such as mitosis, M phase of mitotic cell cycle and translational elongation. To identify other clinically approved drugs with potentially similar mechanisms of action, we took advantage of the recently published Connectivity Map [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], where connections of chemical or biological perturbations can be identified using a web-based interface. As expected, Ly294002 gave the highest positive connectivity for Ly294002-treated samples. Similarly, rapamycin gave a high positive connectivity with fairly low p-values (&#x0003c;0.059) for rapamycin-treated samples. The novel drugs with high positive connectivity with our Ly294002- and rapamycin-treated gene expression profiles included wortmannin, trichostatin A, and rottlerin.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The 17q23 region is one of the most highly amplified regions in breast cancer and <italic>RPS6KB1 </italic>is considered one of its target genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Due to <italic>RPS6KB1 </italic>amplification and overexpression in breast cancer and the role of p70S6K as a downstream mediator of PI3K/mTOR pathway, our aim was to identify PI3K/mTOR/p70S6K pathway downstream targets using gene expression profiling for breast cancer cell lines that we have previously characterized in regard to copy number and gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Five breast cancer cell lines were treated with PI3K/mTOR pathway inhibitors, including two cell lines that were also inhibited with three <italic>RPS6KB1 </italic>siRNAs, since these two cell lines show a high-level expression of p70S6K. The gene expression signatures responsive to both PI3K/mTOR pathway and p70S6K inhibitions revealed previously unidentified genes suggesting novel downstream targets for PI3K/mTOR/p70S6K pathway.</p><p>The PI3K pathway is deregulated in a number of cancers and clinical trials are currently attempting to target different components of this pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The activation of PI3K pathway is associated with aggressive breast cancer and therefore, identification of its downstream targets may have diagnostic value [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Since p70S6K is a downstream mediator of PI3K pathway, we explored gene expression alterations caused by both p70S6K and PI3K/mTOR pathway inhibitions. Altogether, expression levels of 17 genes were altered in both <italic>RPS6KB1</italic>-suppressed and inhibitor-treated samples, including <italic>VTCN1/B7-H4</italic>, <italic>CDKN2B</italic>, <italic>SCD </italic>and <italic>ARL11</italic>. Especially, the down-regulation of <italic>VTCN1</italic>/<italic>B</italic>7-<italic>H</italic>4 is interesting, since it has recently been found to be overexpressed in a number of cancers and have also been linked to poor prognosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The expression of B7-H1, which is a member of the same protein family, has been shown to be increased due to loss of <italic>PTEN </italic>and activation of PI3K pathway, linking PTEN with immunoresistance mediated in part by B7-H1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The down-regulation of <italic>VTCN1</italic>/<italic>B</italic>7-<italic>H</italic>4 due to Ly294002 treatment suggests that similar to B7-H1, B7-H4 is also regulated by PI3K. <italic>CDKN2B</italic>, encoding for cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2B, was up-regulated after mTOR and p70S6K inhibitions in BT-474. Similarly, <italic>CDKN2A</italic>, was up-regulated in MCF-7 in response to p70S6K suppression but not with inhibition of mTOR. The p16/p15 proteins encoded by <italic>CDKN2A</italic>/<italic>CDKN2B </italic>are known to be associated with telomerase activation and cancer progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] as well as to induce cell cycle arrest by inhibition of CDK4 kinase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Interestingly, mTOR inhibition caused significant down-regulation of <italic>CCND1 </italic>suggesting that cell cycle arrest could be caused by either down- or up-regulation of genes activating or inhibiting CDK4. Additionally, <italic>SCD </italic>was down-regulated after mTOR inhibition with rapamycin and p70S6K suppression with <italic>RPS6KB1 </italic>siRNAs. <italic>SCD </italic>encodes stearoyl-CoA desaturase, which has been suggested to promote cell proliferation, invasion and inhibition of apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Our finding of <italic>SCD </italic>as a potential downstream target of PI3K/mTOR/p70S6K pathway is supported by the study of Chang <italic>et al</italic>., which reported that <italic>SCD </italic>is activated by PI3K and inhibited by Ly294002 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Most of the genes identified in our study did not have any previous interaction with PI3K/mTOR/p70S6K pathway. For example, <italic>ARL11</italic>, a gene with recently identified tumor suppressor function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], was up-regulated after both inhibiting PI3K and suppression of p70S6K. Taken together, our study suggests many novel targets potentially regulated by PI3K/mTOR/p70S6K pathway.</p><p>Overall, the number of overlapping genes between three treatments was small, which is expected, since all the inhibitors have different targets with cross-talk also with multiple other pathways. In addition to these biological reasons, there are technical differences that are likely to cause variability for gene expression changes caused by different inhibitors. These include different specificities, efficiencies and mechanisms of action of the treatments as well as differences in assay platforms. For example, Ly294002 is not exclusively selective for the PI3Ks, but is known to inhibit also other lipid kinases than just PI3K [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Secondly, possible off-target effects of <italic>RPS6KB1 </italic>siRNA knock-down or the fact that knock-down mainly resulted in 70% decrease in mRNA levels are possible reasons for variability between different experiments. Finally, inhibitor-treated samples were studied using a 17 K gene expression microarray platform, whereas siRNA-treated samples were hybridized on a 44 K microarray platform causing slight differences in the gene content of these two microarray platforms. To minimize the above-mentioned effects, we took into account only those genes that were differentially expressed by at least two different siRNAs and correlated this information with genes responsive to PI3K and/or mTOR inhibition. This led to the identification of 17 genes that are potential targets of PI3K/mTOR/p70S6K pathway.</p><p>Since PI3K/mTOR pathway has a central role in cell survival and p70S6 kinase is an important regulator of cell cycle progression through the G1/S point, we further studied the effect of Ly294002 and rapamycin on apoptosis and cell cycle. Ly294002 treatment, but not rapamycin, induced apoptosis of the breast cancer cell lines, which may be due to a number of different reasons. Ly294002 inhibits PI3K that further regulates AKT, which has a number of targets that are involved in cell death and survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In contrast, rapamycin inhibits mTOR, which is located downstream of AKT and therefore, AKT mediated effects on apoptosis should not be detected after rapamycin treatment. Additionally, mTOR has been shown to be involved in Notch1-mediated inhibition of p53-induced apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Since the majority of the breast cancer cell lines used in this study carry a mutated form of p53 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin should not affect on p53-induced cell death. Rapamycin also inhibits the phosphorylation and activation of p70S6K through mTOR inhibition. It has been observed that the breast cancer cell lines with an amplification of <italic>RPS6KB1 </italic>are more sensitive to rapamycin than cells with no amplification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Indeed, also in our study, the breast cancer cell lines BT-474, MCF-7 and MDA-361, which have an amplification of <italic>RPS6KB1</italic>, seemed to be sensitive to the rapamycin-induced G1 phase arrest. MCF-7 and BT-474 breast cancer cell lines have mutated forms of <italic>PIK3CA </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], which can render these cells resistant to Ly294002-mediated cell cycle arrest. Surprisingly, Ly294002 treatment resulted in G1 arrest in MCF-7 cells in addition to SK-BR-3 cell line. This discrepancy might be explained by the possibility that MCF-7 cell line harbor mutation with no activating function of PI3K. In contrast, no arrest was detected in BT-474, MDA-361 and MDA-436 cells. Taken together, our results confirm the previously observed effects of these inhibitors on cell cycle and suggest that different breast cancer cell lines have different biological responses to PI3K/mTOR pathway inhibitors; especially MDA-436 seems to be resistant to rapamycin- and Ly294002-induced cell cycle arrest.</p><p>The inhibition of PI3K/mTOR pathway with Ly294002 and rapamycin led to similar gene expression alterations in different breast cancer cell lines. Altogether, 38% of the differentially expressed genes were altered by both treatments. Additionally, a number of genes known to be associated with PI3K/mTOR pathway were differentially expressed. For example, the down-regulation of eIF4G1 in response to rapamycin and Ly294002 treatments was also shown at protein level. This suggests that PI3K/mTOR pathway inhibition leads to the transcriptional deregulation of a number of critical components of the translational machinery. Unlike with PI3K or mTOR inhibition, direct suppression of p70S6K did not seem to down-regulate genes involved in eIF-4F initiation complex. This might be due to the fact that p70S6K is known to regulate the rate of translation of transcripts encoding elongation factors and ribosomal proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], but inhibition of p70S6K do not affect on transcriptional activation of these genes. Gene Ontology Categorizer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] and recently published Connectivity Map [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] were further used to explore the biological processes affected by PI3K/mTOR pathway inhibition and drugs with similar mechanism of action. Indeed, GO categories involved in cell killing, mitosis, and G1 phase of the cell cycle were enriched in Ly294002-treated cells, whereas functional categories like mitosis and translational elongation were among the most enriched classes with lowest p-values in rapamycin-treated cells. Also Connectivity Map gave the highest scores for Ly294002 and rapamycin in the breast cancer cell lines treated with these inhibitors further validating the gene expression profiles responsive to these PI3K and mTOR inhibitors. Also wortmannin scored high in Connectivity Map, which is expected, due to its mechanism as a PI3K inhibitor. Other drugs with high statistical significance included rottlerin, a protein kinase inhibitor, and trichostatin A, a known HDAC inhibitor, both of which are known to inhibit proteins interacting with PI3K/mTOR pathway.</p><p>A number of studies have tried to find markers for pathway activation, since activation of PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway is known to be associated with aggressive cancer. Cancer drugs are increasingly designed to target specific signaling pathways and also in this regard microarrays have been used to identify oncogenic signatures aiming to determine the activation state of specific pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Recently, Saal <italic>et al</italic>. identified a new marker stathmin (<italic>STMN1</italic>) to be associated with PTEN mutation and PI3K activation in breast cancer. Stathmin was also found to be down-regulated due to Ly294002 treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] that is in line with our data [see Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>]. Recently, a transcriptional signature specific for AKT1 activation and subsequent mTOR inhibitor RAD001 treatment was identified in luminal epithelial cells of the mouse ventral prostate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. In another recent study, the presence of this transcriptional signature was evaluated in five publicly available microarray data sets from clinical breast tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Altogether, 57 AKT1-signature genes had p-values less than 0.01 in three breast cancer data sets, from which 34 genes were regarded as RAD001-insensitive and 23 genes as RAD001-sensitive. We also evaluated whether these genes would be differentially expressed in response to rapamycin treatment in our study. Interestingly, 21% (7/34) of the genes that positively correlated with <italic>AKT1 </italic>expression in a study by Creighton and co-workers, correlated positively with <italic>AKT1 </italic>expression also in our rapamycin-treated breast cancer cell lines. However, in Creighton's study, the expression of these genes did not change due to RAD001 treatment and therefore, these genes were considered RAD001-insensitive. In our data, these genes were down-regulated due to rapamycin treatment opposite to the observation in clinical breast tumors, in which these genes were up-regulated together with <italic>AKT1</italic>. These results support the idea that these genes are co-expressed with <italic>AKT1</italic>, although based on our data their role in rapamycin sensitivity could not be confirmed.</p><p>In the present study, we took the approach to assess transcriptional alterations in response to inhibition of PI3K/mTOR/p70S6K pathway in breast cancer cell lines with known gene copy number and gene expression alterations, since <italic>RPS6KB1 </italic>encoding p70S6K is one of the most highly amplified and overexpressed genes in breast cancer. The inhibition of PI3K/mTOR pathway by small molecule inhibitors led to similar gene expression alterations across several breast cancer cell lines with different biological outcomes. Since no specific inhibitor for p70S6K is currently available, we prompted to use three different <italic>RPS6KB1 </italic>siRNAs for inhibition of p70S6K in cell lines with high-level amplification and overexpression of <italic>RPS6KB1</italic>. Altogether, 109 and 173 genes were differentially expressed in two <italic>RPS6KB1</italic>-suppressed breast cancer cell lines, including 68 genes of which expression was altered in both cell lines and 17 genes that overlapped with genes differentially expressed after the small molecule inhibitor treatments. We suggest that these 17 genes that were differentially expressed after both PI3K or mTOR inhibitions and p70S6K inhibition with at least two siRNAs against <italic>RPS6KB1 </italic>are potential downstream targets of PI3K/mTOR/p70S6K pathway.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We identified a number of genes that were differentially expressed due to p70S6K suppression and PI3K/mTOR pathway inhibitions suggesting novel downstream targets of PI3K/mTOR/p70S6K pathway.

The effect of the inhibitors on p70S6K phosphorylation was studied using rabbit p-p70S6 kinase antibody for Thr389 phosphorylation (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in 1:1000 dilution. The total protein amount of p70S6 kinase was studied as above. We also performed protein-level validation of the microarray results with the following antibodies: Akt (1:1000, Cell Signaling), mTOR (1:500, Cell Signaling), and eIF4G1 (1:500, Abcam, Cambridge, UK).
