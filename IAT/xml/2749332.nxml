While the localization of proteins at distinct membrane domains are likely regulated in different ways, the roles of PI3K (III) and its effectors have not been extensively investigated in a polarized cell during tissue development. In this study, we examined <italic>in vivo</italic> functions of PI3K (III) and its effector candidate Rabenosyn-5 (Rbsn-5) in <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing primordial cells, which are polarized along the apical-basal axis. Knockdown of the PI3K (III) subunit <italic>Vps15</italic> resulted in an accumulation of the apical junctional proteins <italic>D</italic>E-cadherin and Flamingo and also the basal membrane protein &#x003b2;-integrin in intracellular vesicles.

This polarity is formed and maintained by distinct localization of membrane spanning and associated proteins, to apical, lateral or basal membrane domains. Membrane proteins localized to the apical or basolateral plasma membrane are endocytosed into early and apical or basolateral endosomes. For example, horseradish peroxidase (HRP) administered to the apical cell surface is incorporated into the apical early endosome. By contrast, HRP or dimeric IgA administered to the basolateral cell surface or transferring receptor (TfR) in the basolateral domain are internalized into the basolateral early endosome, which remain distinct <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007306-Apodaca1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007306-Bomsel1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Sorting of proteins for transcytosis, recycling and degradation takes place in these early endosomes. The proteins, incorporated into apical and basolateral early endosomes, meet in common endosomes, a process that can be observed within 15 min after the onset of internalization in MDCK cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007306-Bomsel1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. The significance of keeping the apical and basolateral early endosomes distinct is thought to ensure that proteins from the apical and basolateral plasma membrane remain apart before the sorting processes proceeds. Although it is plausible that the trafficking of proteins in distinct membrane domains is regulated differently, the factors involved in such a differential regulation remain elusive.</p><p>One of the key molecules regulating membrane trafficking is PI3K (III), a heterodimer of Vps34p and Vps15p/p150, which produces phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PI(3)P) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007306-Herman1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007306-Stack1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>.

Since the attachment of the dorsal and ventral wing surfaces requires the basal localization of integrins to form basal junctions, we also examined whether the abnormal localization of &#x003b2;-integrin by the single knockdown for <italic>dVps15</italic> or <italic>Rbsn-5</italic> is enhanced by their double knockdown. To demonstrate the synergistic enhancement, we induced dsRNAs weakly for either <italic>dVps15</italic> or <italic>Rbsn-5</italic> to induce only marginal defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007306-g008">Fig. 8D</xref>). Under this condition, the double knockdown resulted in obvious delocalization of &#x003b2;-integrin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007306-g008">Fig. 8D</xref>), which is consistent with the adult wing phenotype. These results support the notion that Rbsn-5 functions under the control of PI3K (III).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we have demonstrated that PI3K (III) differentially regulates the localization of proteins at distinct membrane domains. The intracellular accumulation of Fmi, <italic>D</italic>E-cadherin and &#x003b2;-integrin induced by the <italic>dVps15</italic> knockdown might be due to defects in the degradation pathway, since the maturation of MVBs and the lysosomal trafficking were defective in these cells. However, unlike these proteins, Fas III did not accumulate in the intracellular compartments, but rather accumulated at the surface of the lateral plasma membrane. It is possible that PI3K (III) regulates proteins at the lateral membrane differently from those localized at other membrane domains. It is also possible that PI3K (III) regulates Fas III in a different way, irrespective of the membrane domain to which it is localized. Whichever is the case it will be important to elucidate the mechanism underlying this difference in a future study.</p><p>We have also demonstrated that Rbsn-5, a FYVE domain-containing protein, shares a part of the functions of PI3K (III), in that it is necessary for the regulation of Fas III and &#x003b2;-integrin localization, but not that of <italic>D</italic>E-cadherin and Fmi localization. Although the <italic>Rbsn-5<sup>C241</sup></italic> null mutant clones may not completely lack Rbsn-5 activity, the requirement of Rbsn-5, or at least the requirement of an appropriate amount, differs between these proteins with respect to normal trafficking. It appears that Rbsn-5 preferentially controls the events at the basolateral regions, given that Rbsn-5 is necessary for the formation of large endosomes at the basal region, whereas it is indispensable for the formation of actin bundles at the apical surface.</p><p>PI3K (III) has been implicated in the differential regulation of vesicle trafficking at apical and basolateral regions. For instance, a reduction of PI(3)P dissociates EEA1, a FYVE-domain containing protein essential for early endosome fusion, selectively from basolateral endosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007306-Tuma1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. However, which proteins, including EEA1, regulate the different trafficking pathways downstream of PI3K (III) has remained unknown. Rbsn-5 has been proposed to be a PI3K (III) effector, since Rbsn-5 harbors a FYVE domain. Our results provide further evidence supporting a possible functional interaction between these two molecules, based on their genetic interaction on the wing morphogenesis and the PI3K (III)-dependent Rbsn-5 immunostaining. Importantly, the different requirement of Rbsn-5 for trafficking at apical junction and basolateral membrane domains suggests that Rbsn-5 may a selective regulator under the control of PI3K (III).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Fly strains</title><p>Flies were reared in vials containing a standard cornmeal medium at 25&#x000b0;C.
