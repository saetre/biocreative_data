How T<sub>regs</sub> mediate their suppressive function is unclear. Here we identified a cell surface molecule, called GARP, (or LRRC32), which within T cells is specifically expressed in T<sub>regs</sub> activated through the T cell receptor (TCR). Ectopic expression of GARP in human na&#x000ef;ve T (T<sub>N</sub>) cells inhibited their proliferation and cytokine secretion upon TCR activation. Remarkably, GARP over-expression in T<sub>N</sub> cells induced expression of T<sub>reg</sub> master transcription factor Foxp3 and endowed them with a partial suppressive function. The extracellular but not the cytoplasmic region of GARP, was necessary for these functions. Silencing Foxp3 in human T<sub>reg</sub> cells reduced expression of GARP and attenuated their suppressive function. However, GARP function was not affected when Foxp3 was downregulated in GARP-overexpressing cells, while silencing GARP in Foxp3-overexpressing cells reduced their suppressive activity. These findings reveal a novel cell surface molecule-mediated regulatory mechanism, with implications for modulating aberrant immune responses.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Regulatory T cells (T<sub>regs</sub>) were recently identified as a specialized subset of T cells that suppress auto-reactive cells to maintain immunological tolerance and inhibit autoimmunity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002705-Sakaguchi1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

Structure-function analysis of GARP revealed that the extracellular domain, but not the cytoplasmic region, was important for its function, suggesting an interaction of GARP with other signaling receptor(s).

(F) Percentage of suppression was calculated based on CFSE dilution of target T<sub>N</sub> cells in the suppression culture. The &#x00025; suppression on Y-axis is calculated as follows: We first determined the percent of CFSE labeled target cells dividing in response to the stimuli alone. We then determined the proliferative percentage of cells in the presence of suppressor (T<sub>regs</sub> or GARP expressing cells) or control effector T cells. The percent suppression was then calculated by percent reduction in proliferation of the target cells in the presence of effectors as compared to target cells alone. As an example, in one experiment 40&#x00025; of the CFSE labeled T cells divided in response to SEB stimulation. In the presence of T<sub>regs</sub> the same cells divided only 4&#x00025;.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002705-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>, silencing Foxp3 in GARP-expressing cells did not alter their suppressive ability, while downregulation of Foxp3 in T<sub>regs</sub> resulted in significant attenuation of their suppressive capability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002705-Antons1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, which was reduced to similar levels as GARP-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002705-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>).

In addition, silencing Foxp3 expression in T<sub>reg</sub> cells reduced induction of GARP upon TCR activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002705-g004">Fig. 4D</xref>), which correlated with partial loss of suppressive activity in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002705-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). These findings suggest that induction of GARP in T<sub>regs</sub> is dependent on Foxp3 expression, while its inhibitory action on T cell activation is independent of sustained expression of Foxp3.</p><fig id="pone-0002705-g004" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0002705.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>GARP functions as a downstream effector molecule of Foxp3 expression.</title><p>(A) Efficient knockdown of Foxp3 expression in GARP-transduced and T<sub>reg</sub> cells.

To test this hypothesis further, we silenced GARP expression through shRNA in Foxp3-induced Tr<sub>egs</sub>. We designed two different shRNAs against GARP, which reduced the expression of GARP between 60 to 80&#x00025; in Foxp3-induced T<sub>regs</sub> (data not shown).

Despite intense research, the mechanisms by which T<sub>regs</sub> mediate their suppressive effect are not completely understood. Here we identified a molecule, called GARP, which mediates part of the T<sub>reg</sub> suppressive activity. Ectopic expression of GARP in human T<sub>N</sub> cells resulted in a partial T<sub>reg</sub> phenotype, as determined by increased Foxp3, CD25 and CD62L expression, decreased cytokine production (IFN&#x003b3; and IL-2), impaired proliferative capacity and display of suppressive activity. Silencing GARP in Foxp3-induced T<sub>regs</sub> reduced their suppressive function. These data suggest a pivotal role for GARP in controlling aberrant or unwanted T cell activation.</p><p>GARP is highly conserved across species, suggesting that it mediates an important function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002705-Roubin1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. The mouse and human GARP amino acid sequences share 82&#x00025; identity. The similarity rises to 87&#x00025; if conservative amino acid changes are allowed, which argues the possibility for cross-reaction between mouse GARP with human GARP binding partners. Indeed, similar to the human counterpart, murine GARP was also upregulated only in mature murine T<sub>regs</sub> upon activation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002705.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Further, murine GARP-expressing human T cells exhibited a very similar phenotype as those expressing human GARP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002705.s001">Figure S1 C&#x02013;F</xref>). We conclude that both murine and human GARP are able to interact with the human GARP binding partners. Future genetic manipulation in mice to determine the role of GARP <italic>in vivo</italic> will be invaluable in understanding the role of this molecule in function and development of T<sub>reg</sub> cells.</p><p><italic>GARP</italic> gene, originally called <italic>GARP</italic>, contains two exons. The first exon encodes the signal peptide and nine amino acid residues, and the second one contains 20 repeats of the LRR motif, the transmembrane domain and a short cytoplasmic domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002705-Ollendorff2">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002705-Roubin1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. We found that deletion of LRRs in GARP results in complete loss of its function, while mutant lacking the short cytoplasmic domain behaved similarly to the WT GARP. The LRRs are generally 20&#x02013;29 residues long, with the consensus sequence LxxLxLxxN/CxL. Proteins with LRR constitute a large superfamily involved in diverse functions, such as adenylate cyclase in yeast, the proteoglycans decorin and biglycan in human, and disease resistance genes in plants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002705-Kobe1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. GARP, as an LRR containing molecule (LRRC32), shows similarity to glycoprotein V, which is one of the components forming the GPIb-IX-V complex on platelet surface famous for the interaction with von Willebrand factor complex to mediate the adhesion of platelets to injured vascular surfaces <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002705-Canobbio1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. It was recently shown that GARP is expressed on the cell surface of platelets using a polyclonal antibody raised against its extracellular portion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002705-Macaulay1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, we generated GFP-tagged versions of WT and &#x00394;SP mutant of GARP and based on image analysis of cells expressing a GFP, confirmed WT but not &#x00394;SP, appears to be localized to cell surface region (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002705.s002">Figure S2</xref>). This expression profile of GARP suggests that LRRs at the extracellular region could mediate its function, possibly through interaction with another cell surface molecule(s). We also ruled out that GARP-mediated suppression is mediated by a soluble factor since neither separating GARP-expressing cells via transwells nor adding supernatants from these cells to target cells showed any suppressive function (data not shown). Our finding that the cytoplasmic region was dispensable also strongly argues the possibility that GARP itself is not likely to be delivering intracellular signals but conceivably may interact with a receptor molecule expressed by target T cells, which deliver inhibitory signals. Alternatively, GARP may be part of a signaling surface complex similar to glycoprotein V <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002705-Canobbio1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>We found that GARP was induced in T cells ectopically expressing Foxp3 and reduced in expression when Foxp3 was silenced in natural T<sub>regs</sub>. These findings suggest that Foxp3 is a regulator of GARP expression. It remains to be determined whether Foxp3 directly activates GARP transcription or indirectly through other transcription factors. It will also be interesting to determine whether in IPEX patients or scurfy mice, which have defective expression or mutations in Foxp3, GARP expression is also reduced. Although Foxp3 appears to be required for GARP expression in T cells, silencing Foxp3 in cells forced to express GARP does not reduce their suppressive function. Furthermore, we showed that silencing of GARP in Foxp3-induced T<sub>regs</sub> diminished their suppressive function. Together these data imply that GARP is an effector molecule downstream of Foxp3 that can directly display inhibitory signaling once it is expressed.</p><p>Peripheral tolerance to self-antigens is an important secondary mechanism that prevents autoimmune reactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002705-Romagnani1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, T<sub>regs</sub> have also been proposed to play a role in pregnancy by allowing continuous release of placental antigens into the maternal circulation, thus permitting tolerance towards the semiallogeneic fetus until birth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002705-Zenclussen1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002705-Zenclussen2">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>.

Interestingly, GARP was found to be highly expressed in placenta in both mouse and human <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002705-Ollendorff2">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002705-Roubin1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. Expression of GARP in placenta might be essential in creating a &#x0201c;tolerant&#x0201d; privileged microenvironment to avoid rejection of the fetus, and this privilege could even be independent of T<sub>regs</sub>, although it remains to be determined whether GARP expression on non-T cells can also inhibit T cell activation.</p><p>In summary, GARP is highly specific to activated T<sub>reg</sub> cells, and has the ability to mediate partial T<sub>reg</sub> characteristics, importantly including their suppressive function. Identification of this T<sub>reg</sub> cell specific molecule may have implications in understanding regulation of unwanted immune responses and sustaining tolerance by T<sub>reg</sub> cells. The discovery of GARP as an immune suppressive molecule in primary human T cells may also be relevant for exploiting the function of this molecule to modulate immune responses during autoimmunity, transplantation or persistent immune activation caused by chronic infections such as HIV. Conversely, blocking GARP signals can amplify immune responses to antigens in the context of vaccine development or boost the immune response to infections and tumors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cell purification and culture</title><p>T<sub>N</sub>, T<sub>M</sub>, T<sub>Nreg</sub> and T<sub>reg</sub> cells, were purified and cultured as described before <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002705-Antons1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002705-OswaldRichter1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>.
