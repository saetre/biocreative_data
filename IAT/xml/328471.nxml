This method has been used to disrupt the 6-16 gene, an interferon (IFN)-inducible gene of unknown function, in two different human cell lines. Disruption was caused by integration of a targeting construct containing a promoterless gene for human growth hormone (hGH) which was expressed after HR with the 6-16 gene. Homologous recombinants were detected in pools of non-homologous recombinants by the appearance of hGH in the growth medium after the addition of IFN. Secondary and tertiary rounds of hGH assays were used to sib-select 9 homologous recombinants that were shown to have 1, 2 or 3 copies of the targeting construct integrated at the 6-16 locus. The method, which should be applicable to other transcribed targets, provides an alternative to selection methods, and offers advantages over other screening methods in being simple, rapid, sensitive and reliable.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00094-0056-a" xlink:role="3840"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00094-0056-b" xlink:role="3840"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00094-0051.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3835"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00094-0052.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3836"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00094-0053.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3837"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00094-0054.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3838"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00094-0055.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3839"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00094-0056.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3840"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00094-0057.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3841"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00094-0058.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3842"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
