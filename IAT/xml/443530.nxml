In many eukaryotes, meiosis-specific events that are important for the generation of genetic diversity, such as synaptonemal complex (SC) formation, homologous pairing and recombination, occur at meiotic prophase I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh654c1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh654c3">3</xref>). Meiotic recombination is initiated by double-strand breaks (DSBs) in the genomic DNA that are catalyzed in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> by the topoisomerase-like proteins Spo11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh654c4">4</xref>) and Rec12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh654c5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh654c7">7</xref>), respectively. Mutants of <italic>spo11</italic> in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> and the <italic>spo11</italic> homologs in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> and <italic>Mus musculus</italic> that are incapable of initiating homologous recombination show defects in homologous pairing and&#x0002f;or synapsis formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh654c8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh654c10">10</xref>).</p><p>Since homologous recombination is critical for the generation of viable gametes, a mechanism in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> called the pachytene checkpoint is known to prevent meiotic progression at the pachytene stage if abnormal recombination and&#x0002f;or chromosome synapsis occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh654c11">11</xref>). In contrast, a mechanism in <italic>S.pombe</italic> called the meiotic recombination checkpoint delays initiation of meiosis I chromosome segregation but does not arrest at meiotic prophase I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh654c12">12</xref>). Notably, this delay is tightly linked to the prolonged inactivation of Cdc2 due to the phosphorylation of its tyrosine 15 residues, an event that is dependent on the checkpoint <italic>rad</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh654c12">12</xref>). The proteins involved in the DNA damage checkpoint also participate in the pachytene checkpoint in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> and the event depends on the formation and processing of DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh654c13">13</xref>). This mechanism also seems to be conserved in mammals since the Atm, Atr, Rad1 and Chk1 proteins that are involved in the damage checkpoint localize to the meiotic chromosomal cores and are thought to play important roles in recombination and meiotic arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh654c14">14</xref>).</p><p>In <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic>, Hop2 plays a crucial role in the proper alignment of homologous chromosomes during meiotic prophase and functions in the same pathway with Rad51 and Dmc1, two homologs of <italic>E.coli</italic> RecA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh654c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh654c16">16</xref>). <italic>Hop2</italic> knockout mice display similar phenotypes to <italic>hop2</italic> mutant of <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> such that spermatocytes arrest at the stage of pachytene-like chromosome condensation and the meiotic DSBs fail to be repaired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh654c17">17</xref>). Thus, the Hop2 functions seem to be conserved in mammals. It should be remembered, however, that a Hop2 ortholog has not been found in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> and <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> and that recombination itself is not required for either homologous pairing or synapsis in mutants of the <italic>spo11</italic> homologues in these organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh654c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh654c19">19</xref>). Thus, the mechanisms regulating meiotic pairing and recombination in these species seem to differ from those in many other organisms.</p><p><italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> is a useful model organism for the study of meiotic recombination, checkpoint and chromosome pairing because it lacks SC formation and harbors only three chromosomes. This makes it possible to study the regulatory mechanisms of these events independent of the SC formation event. With this in mind, we have isolated many meiosis-specific genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh654c20">20</xref>) and found that one of these, <italic>meu13</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, which encodes an ortholog of Hop2, plays an important role in homologous pairing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh654c21">21</xref>). In this paper, we report the identification of an association partner of Meu13, and the functional analysis of this protein. This identification was initially made on the basis that Meu13 harbors a coiled-coil motif that is required for protein&#x02013;protein interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh654c22">22</xref>). We searched the genome database for unidentified <italic>S.pombe</italic> genes that harbor coiled-coil motifs and found one that has a meiosis-specific expression pattern. This gene is referred to as <italic>mcp7</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> (after <italic>m</italic>eiotic <italic>c</italic>oiled-coil <italic>p</italic>rotein) that encodes an ortholog of Mnd1 of <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh654c23">23</xref>), an association partner of Hop2. The <italic>mnd1</italic>-null mutant arrests in meiotic prophase with most DSBs unrepaired and homolog pairing severely reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh654c23">23</xref>). Mnd1 is suggested to be involved in strand invasion since <italic>mnd1-1</italic> mutant cells initiated recombination but did not form heteroduplex DNA or Holliday junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh654c24">24</xref>). We report here the functional analysis of <italic>mcp7</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Genetics and molecular biology of <italic>S.pombe</italic></title><p>The strains used in this study are listed in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh654tb1">1</xref>.

This plasmid construct was digested with KpnI and SacI and the resulting construct was introduced into the haploid strains, TP4-1D and TP4-5A.

To obtain the 3&#x02032; downstream region, we used the same primers as described above. The DNA fragment spanning the ORF of <italic>mcp7</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> was digested by EcoRV and this truncated form of the <italic>mcp7</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> ORF was inserted into <italic>ura4</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup>-containing pBluescriptII KS (&#x0002b;) vector via EcoRV&#x02013;NotI.

This step removes the proteins in the WCE that interact non-specifically with the beads. We then added primary antibodies specific for HA or GFP, namely, rabbit polyclonal anti-HA (MBL Inc., Japan) antibody and rabbit polyclonal anti-GFP antibody (MBL Inc., Japan) at 1 : 50 and 1 : 200 dilutions, respectively to the supernatant and incubated the mixture on a rotating wheel overnight at 4&#x000b0;C.

We then obtained DNA fragments from each of these genes and used them as probes in northern blot analysis of RNA obtained from <italic>CD16-1</italic> (<italic>h</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup>&#x0002f;<italic>h</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup>) and <italic>CD16-5</italic> (<italic>h<sup>&#x02212;</sup></italic>&#x0002f;<italic>h</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup>) cells harvested at various times after the induction of meiosis by nitrogen starvation. This analysis revealed that <italic>mcp7</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> displays meiosis-specific expression that peaks at the horsetail phase (6 h after induction), which is when homologous chromosome pairing and recombination occur (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh654f1">1</xref>A).</p><p>The production of the Mcp7 protein during meiosis was then assessed by western blot analysis. To attain a synchronized meiotic progression, we replaced <italic>mcp7</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> gene of <italic>pat1-114</italic> cell with <italic>mcp7</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup>&#x02013;<italic>3ha</italic> fusion gene that can express Mcp7 protein tagged with three copies of the HA epitope. Then, the <italic>pat1-114mcp7</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup>&#x02013;<italic>3ha</italic> diploid cells were induced to enter synchronized meiosis and their lysates were subjected to western blot analysis using an anti-HA antibody. We confirmed that the meiotic progression and spore morphology of <italic>pat1-114mcp7</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup>&#x02013;<italic>3ha</italic> diploid cells were similar to <italic>pat1-114</italic> cells. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh654f1">1</xref>B, the timing of appearance of Mcp7&#x02013;3HA protein during meiosis is the same with that of Meu13, an ortholog of the protein <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> Hop2, which is required for proper homologous pairing and recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh654c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh654c21">21</xref>). However, the timings of peaks and disappearance of Mcp7 protein are about 30 min delay as compared to those of Meu13.</p><p>Mcp7 consists of 210 amino acids and harbors a coiled-coil motif (amino acids 75&#x02013;134) and a nuclear localization signal (11&#x02013;14; KRRR) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh654f1">1</xref>C). Using the BLAST algorithm (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genome.ad.jp/">http://www.genome.ad.jp/</ext-link>), we identified putative orthologs of Mcp7 in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> (Mnd1), <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, mice and humans (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh654f1">1</xref>D). All of these orthologs bear a coiled-coil motif in the middle. The phylogenetic tree constructed by the neighbor-joining method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh654c29">29</xref>) indicates that the amino acid sequences of these five Mcp7 orthologs are closely related to one another (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh654f1">1</xref>E). Thus, Mcp7 may play a conserved role in different species.</p></sec><sec><title>Mcp7 forms a complex with Meu13 and localizes in the nucleus</title><p>Since both Mcp7 and Meu13 harbor a coiled-coil motif, we first investigated by immunoprecipitation analysis whether they form a complex <italic>in vivo</italic>. To do this, lysates of cells expressing Mcp7&#x02013;3HA and Meu13&#x02013;GFP were subjected to immunoprecipitation with an anti-GFP antibody followed by western blotting and probing with an anti-HA antibody. This revealed a band of the expected size of Mcp7&#x02013;3HA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh654f2">2</xref>A). This suggests that Mcp7 forms a complex with Meu13 <italic>in vivo</italic>. The blot also reveals the presence of another, smaller band that is apparently recognized by the anti-HA antibody. This band did not disappear when the lysates were treated with phosphatase (data not shown), which suggests that it is not a phosphorylated form of Mcp7. Instead, this band disappeared when the cell lysates were boiled just after dissolving them in the HB buffer (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh654f1">1</xref>B and Materials and Methods). Thus, it may be a degradation product because the cell lysates were kept intact overnight for immunoprecipitation, during which the lysates were exposed to proteases before they were boiled for electrophoresis.</p><p>To examine the subcellular localization of Mcp7, we constructed a Mcp7&#x02013;GFP-expressing strain, induced it to undergo meiosis and observed the GFP signal under a microscope. We considered the Mcp7&#x02013;GFP fusion protein functional because the <italic>mcp7</italic>&#x02013;<italic>gfp</italic> strain showed normal meiotic progression and spore morphology. The Mcp7&#x02013;GFP protein began to appear in the nucleus at the horsetail period (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh654f2">2</xref>B). This suggests that, like Meu13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh654c21">21</xref>), Mcp7 localizes in the nucleus during meiosis. To determine whether this nuclear localization is due to the attachment of Mcp7 to the chromosomes, we performed a chromatin spread experiment with <italic>mcp7</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup>&#x02013;<italic>gfp</italic> cells that were collected 6 h after meiotic induction. The GFP signal was observed on the chromatin in most of the chromatin spreads counted (more than 50), which suggests that Mcp7 is tightly attached to the chromatin (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh654f2">2</xref>C). The result suggests that Mcp7 may be involved in the events on chromatin during meiosis, such as pairing of homologous chromosomes, DNA recombination and&#x0002f;or formation of linear element.</p><p>When we confirmed by western blot analysis that Meu13 is expressed in <italic>mcp7</italic>&#x00394;, we found that <italic>mcp7</italic>&#x00394; cells contain less Meu13 protein compared to the <italic>pat1</italic> control strain (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh654f2">2</xref>D-i). This suggests as one of the possibilities that Meu13 is less stable when Mcp7 is absent. On the other hand, as compared to <italic>pat1</italic> control cells, <italic>meu13</italic>&#x00394; cells contain similar amounts of Mcp7&#x02013;3HA whose expression is prolonged due to the delayed meiosis of <italic>meu13</italic>&#x00394; strain (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh654f2">2</xref>D-ii). The result may also suggest that Mcp7 becomes more stable when Meu13 is absent. This difference in dependence between Mcp7 and Meu13 proteins may explain some of the phenotypic difference between <italic>meu13</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>mcp7</italic>&#x00394; cells (see Discussion).</p></sec><sec><title>The <italic>mcp7</italic>&#x00394; cells are defective in both intergenic and intragenic recombinations</title><p>To determine whether, like Meu13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh654c21">21</xref>), Mcp7 plays a role in meiotic recombination, we measured the rates of intergenic and intragenic recombinations in the <italic>mcp7</italic>&#x00394; strain.

When the <italic>mcp7</italic>&#x00394; strain was crossed, the frequency of its Ade<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> recombinant spores was 20% of the wild-type frequency (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh654f3">3</xref>B).

Thus, it appears that Mcp7 plays a significant role in meiotic recombination. It appears that it is as important in this process as Meu13 and even more important than Rad17.</p></sec><sec><title>The spores of the <italic>mcp7</italic>&#x00394; strain are abnormal</title><p>Next, we observed the spore morphology of <italic>mcp7</italic>&#x00394; cells and found that nearly 20% of the asci displayed abnormal number of ascospores, as some asci include only one, two or three ascospores (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh654f4">4</xref>A). Of the <italic>meu13</italic>&#x00394; asci, 30% also harbored abnormal number of ascospores, and the absence of both genes (the <italic>mcp7</italic>&#x00394;<italic>meu13</italic>&#x00394; double mutant strain) yielded a similar number.

However, only 12% of the <italic>rad17</italic>&#x00394; asci showed similar abnormalities, but this value increased up to 62% in the <italic>mcp7</italic>&#x00394;<italic>rad17</italic>&#x00394; double mutant. This is similar to what has been observed for the <italic>meu13</italic>&#x00394;<italic>rad17</italic>&#x00394; double mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh654c12">12</xref>). As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh654f4">4</xref>C, the spore viability of <italic>rad17</italic>&#x00394; was similar to that of the wild-type cells, whereas the <italic>mcp7</italic>&#x00394;, <italic>meu13</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>mcp7</italic>&#x00394;<italic>meu13</italic>&#x00394; mutants displayed slightly reduced spore viability. On the other hand, the <italic>mcp7</italic>&#x00394;<italic>rad17</italic> mutant showed significantly reduced spore viability compared with the corresponding single mutants.</p><p>These results indicate a close correlation between aberrant spore numbers per ascus (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh654f4">4</xref>A) and percentages of unequally segregated nuclei (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh654f4">4</xref>B), except for the <italic>mcp7</italic>&#x00394;<italic>rad17</italic>&#x00394; double mutant where there is good spore formation but many unequally-segregated nuclei. This seems to imply that Rad17 activity delays meiosis to allow some repair of fragmented DNA in <italic>mcp7</italic>&#x00394;&#x0002f;<italic>meu13</italic>&#x00394; backgrounds, but at the cost of defective spore formation. In contrast, spores form mostly normally but DNA is highly fragmented in a <italic>mcp7</italic>&#x00394;<italic>rad17</italic>&#x00394; double mutant, hence yielding the low spore viability (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh654f4">4</xref>C).</p></sec><sec><title><italic>mcp7</italic>&#x00394; cells show a delay in initiation of meiosis I chromosome segregation</title><p>We previously showed that <italic>meu13</italic>&#x00394; cells exhibit a delay in initiation of meiosis I chromosome segregation, and that this delay is dependent on <italic>rad17</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, a checkpoint <italic>rad</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh654c12">12</xref>). To determine whether <italic>mcp7</italic>&#x00394; cells also show similar defects, we monitored their meiotic progression. To synchronize meiosis, we used the <italic>pat1-114</italic> mutant, which enters meiosis in a highly synchronous manner when it is shifted to its restrictive temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh654c30">30</xref>). Thus, homozygous diploid <italic>pat1</italic>, <italic>pat1mcp7</italic>&#x00394;, <italic>pat1meu13</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>pat1mcp7</italic>&#x00394;<italic>meu13</italic>&#x00394; cells were arrested at G<sub>1</sub> stage by nitrogen starvation and then shifted to the restrictive temperature (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh654f5">5</xref>A). Meiotic recombination occurs at the horsetail stage, which is when the nucleus moves backwards and forwards several times. The horsetail stage started at similar time points in all the strains tested (&#x0223c;2 h after temperature shift, peaking at &#x0223c;3 h; data not shown). Thus, the absence of Mcp7 or Meu13 does not appear to affect the entry of <italic>pat1</italic> cells into meiotic prophase.</p><p>In the <italic>pat1 meu13</italic>&#x00394; double mutant, appearance of binucleates due to meiosis I chromosome segregation peaked at 5.25 h. This represents a delay as compared to <italic>pat1</italic> peaking at 4.75 h. To show this delay more clearly, number of cells that harbor one, two or more than three nuclei at 4.5 h or 5.25 h after temperature shift to induce meiosis were displayed by bar graphs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh654f5">5</xref>B). In contrast, the profile of meiotic progression of <italic>pat1mcp7</italic>&#x00394; mutant was similar to <italic>pat1</italic> cells, showing only a slight delay. Notably, the peak (4.75 h) of binucleate appearance of <italic>pat1mcp7</italic>&#x00394;<italic>meu13</italic>&#x00394; cells was almost equal to those of <italic>pat1</italic> cells. This indicates that the meiotic delay of <italic>meu13</italic>&#x00394; mutation was suppressed by additional <italic>mcp7</italic>&#x00394; mutation and that the checkpoint is not triggered in the absence of both Mcp7 and Meu13 (see Discussion). These meiotic progression patterns are reliable because we confirmed them by performing more than three independent experiments and averaging the results.</p><p>We further examined the profiles of meiotic progression in <italic>pat1rad17</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>pat1mcp7</italic>&#x00394; <italic>rad17</italic>&#x00394; mutants, and found that they are similar to <italic>pat1</italic> cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh654f5">5</xref>B). This suggests that the slight meiotic delay of the <italic>pat1mcp7</italic>&#x00394; cells is partly due to defective recombination or DSB repair, which is monitored by checkpoint <italic>rad</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> proteins such as Rad17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh654c12">12</xref>). We also investigated the profile of meiotic progression in <italic>rec12</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>mcp7</italic>&#x00394;<italic>rec12</italic>&#x00394; mutants and found that no meiotic delay is observed in these two mutant cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh654f5">5</xref>B). The result indicates that the delay in initiation of meiosis I chromosome segregation of <italic>mcp7</italic>&#x00394; cells is Rec12-dependent, namely, it is dependent on meiotic DSB formation. The result suggests that Mcp7 functions after meiotic DSB formation.</p></sec><sec><title>Additional <italic>mcp7</italic>&#x00394; mutation in <italic>pat1meu13</italic>&#x00394; cells abolished the delay in phosphorylation of the tyrosine 15 residue of Cdc2</title><p>We previously showed that the phosphorylated form of Cdc2 increases during the pre-meiotic S phase of <italic>pat1</italic> cells and then decreases during meiotic division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh654c12">12</xref>). Moreover, we revealed that the delay <italic>pat1meu13</italic>&#x00394; cells show in initiation of meiosis I chromosome segregation is tightly linked to a delay in the dephosphorylation of the tyrosine 15 residue of Cdc2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh654c12">12</xref>). To determine whether the suppression of meiotic delay by additional <italic>mcp7</italic>&#x00394; mutation in <italic>pat1meu13</italic>&#x00394; cells is linked to Cdc2 dephosphorylation, we performed time-course western blot analysis using an anti-phospho-Cdc2 antibody. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh654f6">6</xref>, the timing of tyrosine 15 dephosphorylation of Cdc2 in the <italic>pat1mcp7</italic>&#x00394;<italic>meu13</italic>&#x00394; triple mutant cells was almost similar to the <italic>pat1</italic> control. The delay in tyrosine 15 dephosphorylations of the <italic>pat1meu13</italic>&#x00394; cells was pronounced as we reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh654c12">12</xref>), whereas only a slight delay is observed in <italic>pat1mcp7</italic>&#x00394; cells. The results are consistent with the onset timing of meiosis I chromosome segregation in these mutant cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh654f5">5</xref>A and B). These results indicate that the suppression of meiotic delay in <italic>pat1meu13</italic>&#x00394; cells by additional <italic>mcp7</italic>&#x00394; mutation is also tightly linked to the tyrosine 15 dephosphorylation of Cdc2.</p></sec><sec><title>Mcp7 and Dmc1 act in the same pathway</title><p>We previously reported that disruption of Dmc1 function caused meiotic delay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh654c12">12</xref>). To know if <italic>mcp7</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> shows any genetic interactions with <italic>dmc1</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, we first compared the recombination rates between <italic>mcp7</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>dmc1</italic>&#x00394; mutants. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh654f7">7</xref>A, the rates of crossing over were severely reduced in <italic>mcp7</italic>&#x00394;, and <italic>dmc1</italic>&#x00394; cells.

These results suggest that Mcp7 and Dmc1 play key roles in meiotic recombination in the same pathway. Similarly in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic>, Mnd1 is supposed to operate downstream of Dmc1 binding to DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh654c24">24</xref>).</p><p>The spore viability of <italic>mcp7</italic>&#x00394; mutant was slightly lowered as compared to wild-type and <italic>dmc1</italic>&#x00394; mutants (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh654f7">7</xref>C). On the other hand, the spore viability of <italic>mcp7</italic>&#x00394;<italic>dmc1</italic>&#x00394; double mutant was a wild-type level. We also observed DNAs in the asci by staining them with Hoechst33342 and found that the percentages of the asci harboring unequally distributed DNA contents increased to 30.3 and 15.5% in <italic>mcp7</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>dmc1</italic>&#x00394; cells, respectively (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh654f7">7</xref>D).

We demonstrate here that these two proteins share the following similar properties. First, their sizes are similar (210 and 216 amino acids), and they both harbor a centrally located coiled-coil motif. Second, they are both evolutionarily conserved among species as their orthologs are found in humans, mice, plants and budding yeast, although the nematode and the fly are exceptions to this, as is discussed above. Third, they are specifically expressed during meiosis at similar time points, namely, at the pre-S phase through to meiosis II, peaking at the horsetail phase (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh654f1">1</xref>A). Fourth, they both localize to the nucleus, in particular, on chromatin (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh654f2">2</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh654f2">2</xref>C). Fifth, the phenotypes of the null mutants are similar, showing reduced recombination rates and spore viability (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh654f3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh654f4">4</xref>C). They also produce spores with abnormal morphology (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh654f4">4</xref>). Sixth, some of these properties are dependent on <italic>rad17</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, a checkpoint <italic>rad</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> gene.</p><p>Like Mnd1 and Hop2 of <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh654c23">23</xref>), we assume that Mcp7 and Meu13 cooperate during meiosis through interaction with each other. Evidence supporting this is that when they are both expressed within a cell, antibodies specific for one co-immunoprecipitate the other (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh654f2">2</xref>A). This suggests that these proteins can form a complex <italic>in vivo</italic>. The result indicates that Mcp7 and Meu13 form a complex during meiosis and as components of the Meu13 protein complex, they may cooperatively participate in homologous chromosome pairing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh654c21">21</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Mcp7 and Meu13 distinctly cooperate during meiosis</title><p>On the other hand, Mcp7 and Meu13 differ in the following properties. First, Mcp7 and Meu13 show no homology in their amino acid sequences, and Mcp7 alone harbors a nuclear localization signal. Second, their meiotic progression patterns differ slightly, namely, the delay in initiation of meiosis I chromosome segregation is less apparent in <italic>mcp7</italic>&#x00394; cells than in <italic>meu13</italic>&#x00394; cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh654f5">5</xref>A). Third, the timing of disappearance during meiosis of Mcp7 protein is 30 min after that of Meu13 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh654f1">1</xref>B). Fourth, Mcp7 protein is stable in <italic>meu13</italic>&#x00394; cells, whereas Meu13 protein is unstable in <italic>mcp7</italic>&#x00394; cells during meiosis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh654f2">2</xref>D).</p><p>It is notable that <italic>mcp7</italic>&#x00394;<italic>meu13</italic>&#x00394; double mutants exhibit no delay, not only in initiation of meiosis I chromosome segregation but also in dephosphorylating the tyrosine 15 residue of Cdc2. This phenotype can be explained as follows although it is speculative with the present results: delays in meiotic progressions in <italic>mcp7</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>meu13</italic>&#x00394; cells are due to the meiotic checkpoint that may monitor aberrant pairing between non-homologous chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh654c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh654c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh654c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh654c23">23</xref>). Mcp7 and Meu13 cooperate to form proper pairing between homologous chromosomes in wild-type cells. However, in the absence of association partners in <italic>mcp7</italic>&#x00394; or <italic>meu13</italic>&#x00394; cells, Meu13 proteins alone or Mcp7 proteins alone are considered to promote aberrant chromosome pairing in proportion to their amounts. Since the amount of Meu13 proteins in <italic>mcp7</italic>&#x00394; cells is much less than that of Mcp7 proteins in <italic>meu13</italic>&#x00394; cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh654f2">2</xref>D), a larger amount of aberrantly paired chromosome is expected to exist in <italic>meu13</italic>&#x00394; cells than <italic>mcp7</italic>&#x00394; cells. These aberrantly paired chromosomes may trigger the meiotic checkpoint machinery to delay meiotic progression before they are repaired. The extent of meiotic delay may be in proportion to the aberrantly paired chromosome to be repaired, which explains why the delay of <italic>meu13</italic>&#x00394; cells is larger than <italic>mcp7</italic>&#x00394; cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh654f5">5</xref>). The amount of aberrantly paired chromosomes, however, may be reduced because of inefficient chromosome pairing itself in the absence of both Mcp7 and Meu13 proteins, and thus no triggering of checkpoint may occur in <italic>mcp7</italic>&#x00394;<italic>meu13</italic>&#x00394; double mutant cells, explaining the absence of meiotic delay. Examination of these assumptions in <italic>S.pombe</italic> will require further technical developments.</p></sec><sec><title>Evolutionary conservation of Mcp7&#x0002f;Meu13 function</title><p>Mcp7 is an ortholog of the Mnd1 protein of <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh654c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh654c24">24</xref>). Mcp7 is similar to Mnd1 in that both proteins are meiosis-specific chromosomal proteins that harbor a coiled-coil motif and that are required for meiotic recombination. Moreover, they need at least one association partner to fulfill their functions, namely, Mcp7 interacts with Meu13 while Mnd1 interacts with Hop2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh654c15">15</xref>).</p><p>Orthologs of Mcp7 and Meu13 have been identified in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic>, <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, mice and humans as described above.

In <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic>, when SC formation is abnormal due to the defect in homologous chromosome pairing or recombination, meiosis arrests at the pachytene stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh654c23">23</xref>). In contrast, in <italic>S.pombe</italic>, meiosis is not arrested even in such abnormal cases. However, recombination-defective mutants of <italic>S.pombe</italic>, such as the <italic>meu13</italic>&#x00394; strain, will delay their initiations of meiosis I chromosome segregation, and this delay is imposed by the monitoring system that is called the &#x02018;meiotic recombination checkpoint&#x02019; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh654c12">12</xref>). Notably, orthologs of Mcp7 and Meu13 have not been identified in <italic>C.elegans</italic> and <italic>D.melanogaster</italic>. SC formation also differs in these organisms in that Spo11 is not required for synapsis in <italic>C.elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh654c31">31</xref>) and <italic>D.melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh654c32">32</xref>) but is required for synapsis in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh654c33">33</xref>), mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh654c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh654c10">10</xref>) and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh654c8">8</xref>). Thus, the mechanism regulating synapsis in <italic>C.elegans</italic> and <italic>D.melanogaster</italic> may have evolved differently. It may be that orthologs of Mcp7 and Meu13 are required only in organisms that have selected homologous recombination as an essential event in chromosome synapsis.</p><p>Our result suggests that Mcp7 forms a complex with Meu13 that plays a key role in chromosome pairing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh654c21">21</xref>) and seems to act after the formation of meiotic DSBs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh654f5">5</xref>D).
