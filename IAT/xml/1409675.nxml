This enzyme is a glycosylase/lyase and forms a Schiff base-type intermediate with the substrate after the damaged base is removed. To investigate the mechanism of its substrate recognition by X-ray crystallography, we have synthesized oligonucleotides containing 2&#x02032;-fluorothymidine glycol, expecting that the electron-withdrawing fluorine atom at the 2&#x02032; position would stabilize the covalent intermediate, as observed for T4 endonuclease V (Endo V) in our previous study. Oxidation of 5&#x02032;- and 3&#x02032;-protected 2&#x02032;-fluorothymidine with OsO<sub>4</sub> produced two isomers of thymine glycol. Their configurations were determined by NMR spectroscopy after protection of the hydroxyl functions. The ratio of (5<italic>R</italic>,6<italic>S</italic>) and (5<italic>S</italic>,6<italic>R</italic>) isomers was 3:1, whereas this ratio was 6:1 in the case of the unmodified sugar. Both of the thymidine glycol isomers were converted to the corresponding phosphoramidite building blocks and were incorporated into oligonucleotides. When the duplexes containing 2&#x02032;-fluorinated 5<italic>R</italic>- or 5<italic>S</italic>-thymidine glycol were treated with <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> endo III, no stabilized covalent intermediate was observed regardless of the stereochemistry at C5. The 5<italic>S</italic> isomer was found to form an enzyme&#x02013;DNA complex, but the incision was inhibited probably by the fluorine-induced stabilization of the glycosidic bond.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Endonuclease III (Endo III) is an enzyme that initiates base excision repair of oxidatively damaged pyrimidine bases in DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>). Its activity prevents the lethal effects of ionizing radiation. This important enzyme is highly conserved in evolution from bacteria to human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>), and <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> Endo III has been studied intensively. The major substrates for Endo III are 5,6-saturated pyrimidines, such as 5,6-dihydrothymine, 5,6-dihydro-5-hydroxythymine and thymine glycol (5,6-dihydro-5,6-dihydroxythymine), and 5-hydroxy-5-methylhydantoin, which is derived by spontaneous cyclization of fragmented thymine glycol, formed by &#x003b3;-irradiation in DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). This enzyme also recognizes 5-hydroxycytosine and 5-hydroxyuracil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>), which have an unsaturated C5&#x02013;C6 bond, deoxyribosylurea and an apurinic/apyrimidinic (AP) site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>). Recent studies revealed that hydantoins derived by further oxidation of 8-oxoguanine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>), 8-oxoguanine mispaired with guanine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>), and a pyrimidine ring-opened derivative of 1,<italic>N</italic><sup>6</sup>-ethenoadenine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>) were removed by Endo III, although this enzyme was less active for these substrates.</p><p>Endo III has two catalytic activities, i.e. DNA glycosylase and AP lyase. This enzyme removes the damaged base by the scission of its glycosidic bond first and subsequently cleaves the phosphodiester linkage on the 3&#x02032; side of the resultant AP site by a &#x003b2;-elimination reaction. After the first step, a Schiff base-type, covalently-bonded intermediate is formed between the enzyme and the substrate, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sch1">Scheme 1</xref>. This mechanism was originally found in the T4 endonuclease V (Endo V) reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>) and was demonstrated for other glycosylase/AP lyases including Endo III (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). A stable, covalent enzyme&#x02013;DNA complex can be obtained by reduction of the intermediate with sodium borohydride (NaBH<sub>4</sub>), which was used to show the presence of such a covalent intermediate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). This method was applied to crystallization of an Endo III&#x02013;DNA complex, and its tertiary structure has been determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). In this structure study, the C&#x02013;N bond of the reduced Schiff base was shown clearly, and a candidate for the amino acid side chain responsible for the &#x003b2;-elimination reaction was given from the active site structure. However, the substrate recognition mechanism of this enzyme was not elucidated because the oxidized base was lost in the reduced enzyme&#x02013;DNA complex. Therefore, an alternative crystallization method is required to understand the wide substrate specificity of Endo III.</p><p>Previously, we reported that an oligonucleotide duplex containing a 2&#x02032;-fluorinated sugar moiety at the cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer (CPD) site inhibited the T4 Endo V reaction by stabilizing the covalent enzyme&#x02013;DNA complex without the NaBH<sub>4</sub> reduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>). We reasoned that the electron-withdrawing fluorine atom at the C2&#x02032; position stabilized the cyclic hemiacetal form of the sugar moiety, which is inactive in the &#x003b2;-elimination reaction, after the N-terminal &#x003b1;-amino group of the enzyme formed a covalent bond with the 1&#x02032; carbon of the substrate. Since a crystal structure of the T4 Endo V&#x02013;DNA complex was successfully determined using a mutant enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>), this system was not applied to crystallization. Here we describe the synthesis of oligonucleotides containing 2&#x02032;-fluorinated thymidine glycol, which are possible inhibitors of the Endo III reaction and may be used for crystallization of the enzyme&#x02013;DNA complex. The enzyme reaction with the modified oligonucleotide duplexes is also reported.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>For the chemical synthesis, the general methods are basically the same as those reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>).

Because the enzyme reaction with this substrate analog was inhibited, two sets of experiments were carried out to verify the formation of an enzyme&#x02013;DNA complex with a stabilized covalent bond. In one experiment, the covalent complex was detected by SDS&#x02013;PAGE and was compared with that formed between the enzyme and a normal substrate under the NaBH<sub>4</sub>-reducing conditions. In the other experiment, the reaction with the normal substrate was inhibited by pre-treatment of the enzyme with an equimolar amount of the fluorinated analog. Although these experiments clearly showed that the 2&#x02032;-fluorine atom stabilized the covalently-bonded intermediate without the NaBH<sub>4</sub> treatment, we recently noticed an important point to be confirmed. For the SDS&#x02013;PAGE analysis, the 5&#x02032; end of the CPD-containing strand was labeled with [&#x003b3;-<sup>32</sup>P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. This means that only the 5&#x02032; side of the CPD site was proven to be intact. If there is an equilibrium between the cyclic hemiacetal and acyclic imino forms of the sugar moiety, the fluorine atom might have inhibited only the hydrolysis of the C&#x02013;N bond at the product release step, and the chain might have been cleaved because the hydrogen at the 2&#x02032; &#x02018;upper&#x02019; position that should be abstracted in the &#x003b2;-elimination reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>) was present in this substrate analog.

Formation of the stabilized intermediate in the T4 Endo V reaction was analyzed by SDS&#x02013;PAGE. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, the result of the experiment using the duplex labeled at the 3&#x02032; end (lane 4) was identical to that using the 5&#x02032;-labeled one (lane 2).</p></sec><sec><title>Synthesis of the building blocks for the incorporation of 2&#x02032;-fluorothymidine glycol (Tg<sub>F</sub>)</title><p>The lack of chain cleavage for the T4 Endo V reaction with the 2&#x02032;-fluorinated substrate analog indicated the practicality of these types of mechanism-based inhibitors for crystallographic studies.

However, NOESY crosspeaks supporting this conformation were not obtained for our current products (<bold>2a</bold> and <bold>2b</bold> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sch2">Scheme 2</xref>), probably because the sugar pucker was changed from C2&#x02032;-<italic>endo</italic> to C3&#x02032;-<italic>endo</italic> by the fluorine substitution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>).

Because the phosphitylation reaction was slow, an excess amount (three equivalents) of the chlorophosphoramidite reagent was used, and the reaction time was prolonged to 1 h.</p></sec><sec><title>Synthesis of oligonucleotides containing Tg<sub>F</sub></title><p>Assembly of oligonucleotides on a DNA synthesizer, using compounds <bold>5a</bold> and <bold>5b</bold>, was carried out in the same way as reported previously for thymidine glycol without fluorine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). The coupling yield in each cycle was monitored by a conductivity sensor on the synthesizer. Although the values obtained by this method contained relatively large errors, the coupling yields of <bold>5a</bold> and <bold>5b</bold> were between 94 and 108%, which were similar to those of the 2&#x02032;-deoxynucleoside 3&#x02032;-phosphoramidites with the normal bases. Since thymine glycol is labile under alkaline conditions used for oligonucleotide deprotection, commercially available nucleoside 3&#x02032;-phosphoramidites bearing base-labile protecting groups, i.e. phenoxyacetyl, (4-isopropylphenoxy)acetyl and acetyl groups for adenine, guanine and cytosine, respectively, were used. A 13mer, d(ACGCGATg<sub>F</sub>ACGCCA) and a 40mer, d(GCATGCCTGCACGGTg<sub>F</sub>CATGGCCAGATCCCCGGGTACCGAG), were synthesized, separately incorporating the thymine glycol isomers.</p><p>After the removal of the last DMT group on the synthesizer, the oligonucleotides were cleaved from the solid support with ammonium hydroxide at room temperature for 2 h, and the amino groups on the base moieties and the internucleotide phosphates were deprotected simultaneously by this treatment. The procedure for the subsequent removal of the TBDMS group was changed from the original method. We previously used tetrabutylammonium fluoride (TBAF) at this step and found the formation of 5-hydroxy-5-methylhydantoin as a byproduct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). Glen Research reported that removal of the TBDMS group with triethylamine trihydrofluoride, which was originally used for oligoribonucleotide synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>), did not cause this side reaction [<italic>The Glen Report</italic>, Vol. 16, No. 1, page 4 (2003)]. We adopted this method, and the results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. Because the C6 position of deprotected thymine glycol is epimerized in solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>), we describe the stereochemistry only at the C5 position for the obtained oligonucleotides. HPLC analysis on a reversed-phase column gave a single main peak in all cases. The retention times of the oligonucleotides containing 5<italic>R</italic>-thymine glycol were longer than that of each 5<italic>S</italic> counterpart. This result is identical with that obtained for the sugar-unmodified oligonucleotides in our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). The products were purified by reversed-phase HPLC, and the molecular weights of the 13mers were confirmed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis of the Endo III reaction</title><p>Using the 13mer, d(ACGCGATg<sub>F</sub>ACGCCA), the Endo III reaction with the fluorine-containing substrate analogs was analyzed. After <sup>32</sup>P-labeling, the 13mers containing the 5<italic>R</italic> and 5<italic>S</italic> isomers of Tg<sub>F</sub> were separately hybridized to the complementary strand, d(TGGCGTATCGCGT). For comparison, <sup>32</sup>P-labeled, thymine glycol-containing duplexes without fluorine were prepared in the same way. We first tried to detect the stable covalent intermediate in the reaction between <italic>E.coli</italic> Endo III and the fluorine-containing duplexes. Contrary to our expectation, however, such an intermediate was not observed in the analysis by SDS&#x02013;PAGE, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, whereas the Schiff base-type intermediate was trapped with sodium borohydride in the reaction with the non-fluorinated substrates. Then, we analyzed the binding and the incision reaction of Endo III. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, it was found by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) that <italic>E.coli</italic> Endo III formed a complex with the 13 bp duplex containing 2&#x02032;-fluoro-5<italic>S</italic>-thymidine glycol (5<italic>S</italic>-Tg<sub>F</sub>). Binding was not detected for 5<italic>R</italic>-Tg<sub>F</sub>. Cleavage of the thymine glycol-containing strand was not detected for either of the fluorinated substrate analogs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). From these results, it is concluded that the duplex containing 5<italic>S</italic>-Tg<sub>F</sub> is an inhibitor of the <italic>E.coli</italic> Endo III reaction, although the effect of the fluorine atom is not the same as for T4 Endo V.</p><p>To characterize the duplexes containing Tg<sub>F</sub> as inhibitors of the Endo III reaction further, <sup>32</sup>P-labeled, thymine glycol-containing duplexes without fluorine were treated with Endo III in the presence of the 13 bp duplex containing Tg<sub>F</sub>. Consistent with the result of the EMSAs shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, the activity of Endo III for either duplex containing 5<italic>R</italic>- or 5<italic>S</italic>-thymine glycol was inhibited by the 5<italic>S</italic>-Tg<sub>F</sub>-containing duplex in a concentration-dependent manner, but the 5<italic>R</italic>-Tg<sub>F</sub>-containing one did not work (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). This result supported the distinct binding capacities of the 5<italic>R</italic>-Tg<sub>F</sub> and 5<italic>S</italic>-Tg<sub>F</sub> duplexes for Endo III. For quantitative analysis of the inhibition by the 5<italic>S</italic>-Tg<sub>F</sub>-containing duplex, enzymatic parameters (<italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> and <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub>) and the inhibition constant (<italic>K</italic><sub>i</sub>) were determined. Comparison of the enzymatic parameters (<italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>/<italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub>) showed that the 5<italic>S</italic>-thymine glycol-containing duplex had a higher affinity for Endo III than the 5<italic>R</italic> counterpart (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). The Lineweaver&#x02013;Burk plot obtained in the presence of the 5<italic>S</italic>-Tg<sub>F</sub> competitor exhibited a feature characteristic of the competitive reaction. The <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> values without and with the 5<italic>S</italic>-Tg<sub>F</sub>-containing duplex as a competitor were comparable, whereas the <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> value with the competitor was notably higher than that without it. The inhibition constant (<italic>K</italic><sub>i</sub> = 276 nM in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) was significantly higher than the <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> values obtained for the duplexes containing 5<italic>S</italic>- and 5<italic>R</italic>-thymine glycols (31 and 132 nM, respectively), and this result shows that the 5<italic>S</italic>-Tg<sub>F</sub>-containing duplex is a relatively weak inhibitor of Endo III.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In this study, we intended to use a fluorinated sugar moiety as a mechanism-based inhibitor of Endo III. This enzyme forms a covalent Schiff base-type intermediate with the substrate DNA, in the same way as T4 Endo V (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sch1">Scheme 1</xref>). We expected that a fluorine atom attached at the 2&#x02032; position would inhibit the Endo III reaction by stabilizing the cyclic hemiacetal form of the enzyme-linked sugar moiety, and such a substrate analog would be useful for elucidation of the recognition mechanism of this enzyme by X-ray crystallography.</p><p>In the synthesis of the building block of Tg<sub>F</sub>, the OsO<sub>4</sub> oxidation of the protected 2&#x02032;-fluorothymidine resulted in formation of the (5<italic>R</italic>,6<italic>S</italic>)- and (5<italic>S</italic>,6<italic>R</italic>)-thymine glycols (<bold>2a</bold> and <bold>2b</bold>, respectively) in the ratio of 3:1. This ratio was 6:1 when thymidine with the same protecting groups was oxidized under the same conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>), and a large-scale preparation was required to obtain the (5<italic>S</italic>,6<italic>R</italic>) isomer in a yield sufficient for its incorporation into oligonucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). This change in stereoselectivity can be attributed to the C3&#x02032;-<italic>endo</italic> sugar pucker induced by the fluorine substitution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>), and the building blocks of both isomers were obtained at the same time in the present study. Since several groups have recently reported that <italic>E.coli</italic> Endo III and its mammalian counterpart distinguished the 5<italic>R</italic>- and 5<italic>S</italic>-thymine glycols in DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>), the higher yield of the (5<italic>S</italic>,6<italic>R</italic>) isomer is favorable for studies comparing the stereoisomers of this damaged base. Using the phosphoramidite building blocks (<bold>5a</bold> and <bold>5b</bold>), oligonucleotides containing Tg<sub>F</sub> were synthesized, incorporating the thymine glycol isomers separately, in the same way as those without the sugar modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). We confirmed that triethylamine trihydrofluoride prevented the side reaction in the deprotection of thymine glycol-containing oligonucleotides.</p><p>The Endo III reaction was analyzed using the 13mers synthesized in the present study. We were mainly interested in whether the duplex containing Tg<sub>F</sub> could form a stable covalent intermediate with Endo III that was similar to that obtained in our previous study on T4 Endo V (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, such an intermediate was not formed with <italic>E.coli</italic> Endo III. In this experiment, the covalent complex trapped with sodium borohydride was obtained when the thymine glycol-containing duplexes without fluorine were used, and there was a difference between 5<italic>R</italic>- and 5<italic>S</italic>-thymine glycol. The band was detected at a lower enzyme concentration in the case of the 5<italic>S</italic>-thymine glycol-containing substrate. This difference can be attributed to the higher affinity of <italic>E.coli</italic> Endo III for the 5<italic>S</italic> isomer, which was revealed in our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>). To determine why the covalent intermediate was not formed with the fluorine-containing substrate analogs, enzyme binding was analyzed by EMSAs. A complex was detected for the duplex containing 5<italic>S</italic>-Tg<sub>F</sub>, but not for the 5<italic>R</italic> isomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). The enzyme binding to the 5<italic>S</italic>-Tg<sub>F</sub>-containing duplex was confirmed by the competition experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Although <italic>E.coli</italic> Endo III has a higher affinity for the 5<italic>S</italic>-thymine glycol, as described above, these all-or-none results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref> suggest that the sugar conformation affects the substrate recognition because the fluorine atom at the 2&#x02032; position alters the sugar pucker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>). Finally, the DNA glycosylase/AP lyase reaction of Endo III was analyzed, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>. Although the enzyme bound to the duplex containing 5<italic>S</italic>-Tg<sub>F</sub>, incision of this substrate analog was not detected. These results indicate that the inhibition of the Endo III reaction by 5<italic>S</italic>-Tg<sub>F</sub> was caused by the effect of the fluorine atom that is different from the mechanism discussed in our previous study on T4 Endo V (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>). The electron-withdrawing fluorine atom at the 2&#x02032; position affects the reaction of the base excision repair enzyme in two ways. It stabilizes the glycosidic bond of the damaged base and changes the equilibrium between the cyclic hemiacetal and linear aldehyde forms of the deoxyribose at the AP site towards the former that prevents the &#x003b2;-elimination reaction. If the glycosidic bond is cleaved, backbone breakage occurs during electrophoresis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>), and the oligonucleotide containing an AP site migrates slightly faster than the intact one in the analysis by denaturing PAGE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>). In our results, both the substrate analog containing 5<italic>S</italic>-Tg<sub>F</sub> after the Endo III treatment and the untreated one migrated identically on the gel, and no shorter fragment was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, the 5<italic>S</italic>-Tg<sub>F</sub> lanes). These results indicate that the fluorine atom at the 2&#x02032; position of thymidine glycol inhibits the DNA glycosylase activity, not the AP lyase step, in the Endo III reaction, by stabilizing the glycosidic bond.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was supported by a Human Frontier Science Program Research Grant.
