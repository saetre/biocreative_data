A major class of Wnt signaling regulators is the Dickkopf (Dkk) family of secreted glycoproteins. Although the biological properties of Dickkopf 1 (Dkk1) and Dickkopf 2 (Dkk2) are well characterized, little is known about the function of the related Dickkopf 3 (Dkk3) protein in vivo or in cell lines. We recently demonstrated that Dkk3 transcripts are upregulated during photoreceptor death in a mouse model of retinal degeneration. In this study, we characterized the activity of Dkk3 in Wnt signaling and cell death.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Dkk3 was localized to M&#x000fc;ller glia and retinal ganglion cells in developing and adult mouse retina. Western blotting confirmed that Dkk3 is secreted from M&#x000fc;ller glia cells in culture. We demonstrated that Dkk3 potentiated Wnt signaling in M&#x000fc;ller glia and HEK293 cells but not in COS7 cells, indicating that it is a cell-type specific regulator of Wnt signaling. This unique Dkk3 activity was blocked by co-expression of Dkk1. Additionally, Dkk3 displayed pro-survival properties by decreasing caspase activation and increasing viability in HEK293 cells exposed to staurosporine and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. In contrast, Dkk3 did not protect COS7 cells from apoptosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These data demonstrate that Dkk3 is a positive regulator of Wnt signaling, in contrast to its family member Dkk1. Furthermore, Dkk3 protects against apoptosis by reducing caspase activity, suggesting that Dkk3 may play a cytoprotective role in the retina.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Wnt ligands are secreted glycoproteins that control a wide range of processes in the developing embryo and in adult tissues. Aberrant Wnt signaling is increasingly being implicated in numerous diseases, including malignancies, Alzheimers disease, retinal degenerations and abnormal development of the eye, limbs and skeleton [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Characterizing proteins that regulate the Wnt pathway have revealed important insights into Wnt-dependent processes and potential directions towards novel therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>The best understood of the major Wnt pathways is the canonical/&#x003b2;-catenin pathway. In the absence of Wnt ligands, &#x003b2;-catenin levels are suppressed by the APC-axin-GSK3&#x003b2; protein complex via phosphorylation and subsequent degradation by the proteosome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. &#x003b2;-catenin is a transcriptional cofactor and is also an essential component of cell-cell adhesion complexes. Wnt ligands bind to the cell surface receptors Frizzled and LDL receptor related proteins 5 and 6 (LRP5/6), leading to Disheveled activation and ultimately reducing &#x003b2;-catenin degradation. Stabilized &#x003b2;-catenin is transported into the nucleus where it binds to Tcf/Lef type transcription factors and initiates transcription of Wnt target genes.</p><p>The Dickkopf (Dkk) family of proteins, Dkk1, 2, 3 and 4 and Soggy, are secreted regulators of Wnt signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The five Dkk proteins share 37&#x02013;50% protein identity and contain two conserved cysteine-rich regions separated by a variable linker region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Dkk1, Dkk2 and Dkk4 inhibit Wnt signaling by binding to LRP5/6 and the transmembrane protein Kremen which results in LRP5/6 internalization and prevents Wnt and Frizzled from forming an active complex with LRP5/6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Dkk2 can also activate the Wnt pathway in certain situations, depending on the cell type, the presence of Wnt ligands and levels of LRP5/6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>Unlike its related family members, characterizing Dkk3 activity has been elusive. Dkk3 did not regulate Wnt signaling in various activity assays, including Wnt-dependent secondary axis induction in <italic>Xenopus </italic>embryos and Wnt1/Fz8 signaling in cultured cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Dkk3 also did not physicallyinteract with LRP5/6 or Kremen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. However, Caricasole et al demonstrated that Dkk3 was a weak inhibitor of Wnt7A signaling in PC12 cells although co-expression of LRP5 or LRP6 was required to uncover this activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Dkk3 displayed Wnt inhibitor activity in the osteocarcinoma Saos-2 cell line, measured by decreased cytoplasmic levels of &#x003b2;-catenin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], but did not inhibit Wnt reporter Tcf/Lef luciferase activity assays in a prostate cancer cell line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Therefore, the relationship between Dkk3 and Wnt signaling is unclear despite its sequence similarity to the other Dkk genes.</p><p>Dkk3 is expressed during embryonic development in many organs, including neural epithelium, limb bud, bone and heart, particularly in regions of epithelial-mesenchyme transformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Dkk3 is also widely expressed in adult tissues, with the highest levels found in the heart and brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. <italic>Dkk3</italic>-deficient mice develop normally, are fertile and have a mild phenotype that includes hyperactivity, increased immunological and hematological markers and a slight decrease in lung ventilation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The absence of severe phenotypes in Dkk3 knock-out mice may be due to compensation from the Dkk3 homolog <italic>soggy </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Alternatively, physiological stress or injury may be required for the appearance of a Dkk3-dependent phenotype.</p><p>In this study, we investigated the activity of Dkk3 in Wnt signaling and cell death. We demonstrated two novel functions for Dkk3. First, Dkk3 is a cell-specific positive regulator of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway in primary cell culture and cell lines. Second, Dkk3 protected transfected cells from apoptotic stress. We also characterized the distribution of Dkk3 in the retina and found that Dkk3 is expressed highly in M&#x000fc;ller glia and ganglion cells during retinal development and in adult retina. M&#x000fc;ller glia are the principle supportive glia in the retina and are believed to protect photoreceptors during retinal injury by secreting growth factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. We previously demonstrated that Dkk3 transcripts were increased in a mouse model of retinal degeneration, particularly during cone photoreceptor death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Furthermore, Wnt signaling is upregulated during retinal degeneration in M&#x000fc;ller glia and Wnt activators protect primary photoreceptor cultures from apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Together, these results identify for the first time that Dkk3 is a secreted pro-survival signaling protein, and suggest that Dkk3 may play a role in M&#x000fc;ller glia activity in the retina.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Dkk3 is expressed and secreted from retinal M&#x000fc;ller glia</title><p>Cellular differentiation in the mouse retina into the major neuronal and glial cell types occurs at stereotypic time-points during the neo-natal period. We used immunohistochemistry to characterize the distribution of Dkk3 during post-natal retinal development, especially during the time of M&#x000fc;ller glia differentiation. Dkk3 immunoreactivity is present diffusely at post-natal day (P) 5 and becomes concentrated in the developing synaptic layers in the outer plexiform layer (OPL) and ganglion cell layer (GCL) by P8, and then remains in these locations through the beginning of M&#x000fc;ller glia differentiation (P10-12) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). As M&#x000fc;ller glia cells continue to differentiate during P12 to P20, Dkk3 becomes more concentrated in the inner nuclear layer (INL), where nuclei of the interneurons horizontal cells, bipolar cells and amacrine cells are located, and in the narrow margin composed of the photoreceptor inner segments and the external limiting membrane. Localization to this inner segment region (IS) suggests that Dkk3 is expressed in or secreted from M&#x000fc;ller glia end-feet. By P20, Dkk3 appears associated with radial fibers extending across the retina, which correspond to M&#x000fc;ller glia processes.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Dkk3 protein is expressed in the retina during M&#x000fc;ller glial cell differentiation</bold>. Dkk3 immunoreactivity is present diffusely in the developing retina at P5 and at P8 it is localized to the outer plexiform layer (OPL), the site of synaptic processes between photoreceptors and interneurons, and the ganglion cell layer (GCL), where it remains at P10 and P12. During the later stages of retinal differentiation Dkk3 becomes predominantly localized to the inner nuclear layer (INL) and at the inner segment region (IS, arrow), consistent with localization to M&#x000fc;ller glia cell bodies and end-feet. Expression in the OPL and GCL remains high at these ages. By P20, Dkk3 appears localized along radial fibers, representing M&#x000fc;ller glia processes, extending across the retina. These fibers are particularly visible in the outer nuclear layer (ONL). IPL, inner plexiform layer.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2121-8-52-1"/></fig><p>Dkk3 remained localized in the inner nuclear layer and the ganglion cell layer in adult mouse retina (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B&#x02013;E</xref>), consistent with our previous study localizing Dkk3 transcript distribution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Dkk3 staining in the adult also remained prominent in the synaptic plexiform layers between the ONL and INL, and the INL and GCL, and the photoreceptor inner segment (IS) region. Double immunostaining using antibodies against Dkk3 and the M&#x000fc;ller glia marker glutamine synthetase (GS) indicate that Dkk3 colocalizes with GS-positive M&#x000fc;ller glia radial fibers and cell bodies (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C,E</xref>, arrows). The immunostaining in Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> used different anti-Dkk3 antibodies (see Methods) and the equivalent staining patterns confirm the specificity of Dkk3 detection. The specificity of the antibody was confirmed by Western blotting, which detected a single band at the predicted size (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A,K</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Dkk3 is expressed in adult mouse retina, primary M&#x000fc;ller glia culture and a human M&#x000fc;ller glial cell line</bold>. (A) Western blot on lysates from retina, HEK293 cells and a stable cell line expressing Dkk3 (HEK-Dkk3). A single band at 58 kDa, representing post-translationally modified Dkk3, is observed in the retina and in the Dkk3 stable cell line. Smaller bands likely represent degradation products or partially glycosylated Dkk3. (B-E) Dkk3 (green) is located in the photoreceptor inner segment region (IS), inner nuclear layer (INL) and ganglion cell layer (GCL) of adult wild type mice. There is also strong staining in the inner plexiform layer between the INL and GCL. The M&#x000fc;ller glia marker glutamine synthetase (GS) is red and DAPI-stained nuclei are blue. The outer nuclear layer (ONL) contains the photoreceptor nuclei. Dkk3 colocalizes with GS-positive M&#x000fc;ller glia radial fibers and cell bodies (Figure 2E,C arrows). (F-I) Confirmation of Dkk3 localization in M&#x000fc;ller glia. Rat primary M&#x000fc;ller glia were isolated from the retina and cultured. Dkk3 (green) is found in the same cells as the M&#x000fc;ller glia marker glutamine synthetase (red). DAPI-stained nuclei are blue and the merged image is shown. (G) Dkk3 (green) is expressed in the perinuclear region and along processes in the human M&#x000fc;ller glial cell line MIO-M1. Scale bar in B and F is 20 &#x003bc;m and in J is 100 &#x003bc;m. (H) Dkk3 is secreted from MIO-M1 cells. Precipitated proteins from the culture media were separated on a Western blot. The 58 kDa glycosylated Dkk3 is present in both cell lysate (L) and media (M) whereas the 38 kDa non-glycosylated form is not secreted and is only in the cell lysate fraction. &#x003b2;-actin was used as a control.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2121-8-52-2"/></fig><p>M&#x000fc;ller glia span the entire thickness of the tissue, ensheathing and interacting with all retinal neurons. M&#x000fc;ller glia are vital to the normal retinal function by regulating ion concentrations, signaling molecules and neurotransmitters, mediating water transport, and removing glutamate and scavenging free radicals. During retinal degeneration M&#x000fc;ller glia are believed to secrete pro-survival growth factors that protect remaining photoreceptors from injury. To confirm Dkk3 expression in glia we cultured M&#x000fc;ller glia from rat and mouse retinas. One hundred percent of the M&#x000fc;ller glia showed colocalization of Dkk3 with the M&#x000fc;ller glia marker protein glutamine synthetase (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2F&#x02013;I</xref>). Dkk3 was distributed along processes and also in a punctate peri-nuclear pattern, consistent with the endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi complex. This peri-nuclear localization is evident in a higher magnification image of the human M&#x000fc;ller glia cell line MIO-M1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2J</xref>). Western blotting confirmed that Dkk3 is secreted (M, media) from MIO-M1 cultures (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2K</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Dkk3 regulates Wnt signaling</title><p>Wnt signaling was measured using a transcriptional reporter assay with the TOP-FLASH luciferase plasmid. MIO-M1 M&#x000fc;ller glia cells were cotransfected with TOP-FLASH and LacZ plasmids along with Dkk1, Dkk3 or a control gene (GFP). At 48 hrs post-transfection, the transfected cells were incubated with Wnt3a-containing conditioned media or control conditioned media that lacks the Wnt3a ligand.</p><p>Wnt signaling was induced by Wnt3a conditioned media in the MIO-M1 human M&#x000fc;ller glia cell line (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>), indicating that these cells are Wnt-responsive, as we recently demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. The mutated control reporter FOP-FLASH did not show a response to Wnt3a, as expected (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). Dkk1 reduced Wnt3a-induced signaling in MIO-M1 cells by approximately five-fold (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>) compared with GFP expression. In contrast, Dkk3 induced approximately two-fold higher Wnt signaling compared with GFP (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). Interestingly, Dkk3 potentiating activity was cell-type specific. In contrast to the MIO-M1 cells, Dkk3 had a small inhibitory, although not significant, effect on Wnt3a-induced signaling in the COS7 cell line and reduced luciferase activity by 33%compared with control tr ansfections (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). Dkk1 decreased luciferase activity by 67% in COS7 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). This result suggests that COS7 cells do not have the molecular mechanisms to convey Dkk3 potentiating activity or that the inhibitor activity of Dkk3 is greater than, and over-rides, its potentiating activity.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Dkk3 is a positive regulator of Wnt signaling in M&#x000fc;ller glia and a negative regulator in COS7 cells</bold>.

The mutated control reporter FOP-FLASH did not show a response to Wnt3a. Induction is expressed as fold change of conditioned media containing Wnt3a to conditioned media not containing Wnt3a. (B) Luciferase reporter assays in cells transfected with Dkk1, Dkk3 and a control gene (GFP).

In these experiments we tested the activity of Dkk3 when it was added to the glia cells as conditioned media. HEK293 cells stably expressing Dkk3 were created and used as a source of Dkk3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] (see Methods). Dkk3 treatment in the absence of Wnt3a produced baseline levels of Wnt signaling and was equivalent to control media not containing Dkk3 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). Dkk3 by itself had baseline levels in all the cell types tested, indicating that Dkk3 potentiates the Wnt pathway when it is stimulated by Wnt3a but cannot initiate signaling on its own.</p><p>Incubating primary M&#x000fc;ller glia in Dkk3-containing conditioned media increased Wnt signaling by 1.8-fold (Dkk3+Wnt3a compared with Wnt3a treatment alone (control+Wnt3a)). (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). Although co-stimulation with a Wnt ligand was required to demonstrate Dkk3 activity, over-expression of Wnt receptors was not necessary, in contrast to Dkk3 activity in PC12 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>To begin to explore the mechanism of Wnt regulation by Dkk3, we tested whether Dkk1 blocks Dkk3 activity. For this experiment we used a Dkk3 stable cell line made in HEK293 cells to ensure that the majority of cells coexpressed Dkk3 and Dkk1. We previously demonstrated that Dkk3 potentiated Wnt signaling in this cell type[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>Wnt3a ligand induced significantly more Wnt signaling in the cells expressing Dkk3 than the control cell line made with the empty vector (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, compare white and black bars in cells without Dkk1). If Dkk3 acts independently from Dkk1 then we expect that Dkk1 would not fully inhibit Wnt signaling in Dkk3-expressing cells compared with the vector cell line, and that the combination of Dkk3 + Dkk1 + Wnt3a would be less inhibited and have more Wnt signaling than Dkk1 + Wnt3a in the vector cell line. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, Dkk1 inhibited Wnt3a-induced signaling to an equivalent extent in the Dkk3 and vector stable cell lines. This result suggests that Dkk3-mediated potentiation of Wnt3a signaling is dependent on, or occurs upstream from, a Dkk1-controlled pathway or receptor.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Dkk1 blocks Dkk3 activity</bold>. Dkk3 (white bars) and control (black bars) stable cell lines (HEK293 cells) were transfected with the control vector ("no Dkk1") and TOP-FLASH and LacZ plasmids then treated with Wnt3a. The Dkk3 cell line had more Wnt signaling than the vector control line (Luciferase Activity units shown). Transfection of Dkk1 completely abolished Wnt signaling in both the Dkk3 stable cell line and the control cell line. This result suggests that Dkk3 acts in a Dkk1-dependent pathway. * = p &#x0003c; 0.05.

For example, Dkk3 had opposite effects in HEK293 and COS7 cells despite both being transfected with lipofectamine, whereas Dkk3 activity was similar in MIO-M1 cells as HEK293 despite the former being transfected using electroporation.</p></sec><sec><title>Dkk3 regulates cell death</title><p>We next investigated whether Dkk3 plays a role in cell survival by testing the effect of Dkk3 expression on cell death induced by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>and staurosporine.

Dkk3 expression reduced caspase activation by 4-fold in HEK293 cells, compared with the vector control (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). Protection from apoptosis was also observed in three independent clones of HEK293 cell lines stably expressing Dkk3 (data not shown). However, Dkk3 did not reduce caspase activity in COS7 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>). Therefore, Dkk3 demonstrates cell-specific protection, similar to its cell-specific potentiation of Wnt signaling.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion and Conclusion</title><p>The function of Dkk3 and its role in Wnt signaling had been unclear despite it sharing approximately 40% protein identity to the well-characterized Dkk1 and Dkk2 Wnt inhibitors. In the present study, we found that Dkk3 is a cell-type specific regulator of Wnt signaling. Dkk3 increased Wnt activation in primary M&#x000fc;ller glia cultures, a M&#x000fc;ller glia cell line and in HEK293 cells, but not in COS7 cells. Dkk3 activity was not dependent on the method of delivery because transient and stable transfections of Dkk3 plasmids and treatment with Dkk3 conditioned media demonstrated equivalent results. Although the effect of Dkk3 on Wnt signaling may be indirect, to our knowledge this is the first demonstration that Dkk3 acts as a cell-specific positive regulator of the Wnt pathway.</p><p>Dkk3 was originally proposed to be a divergent, non-Wnt regulating Dkk family member [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] although later studies indicated that Dkk3 inhibits Wnt signaling in PC12 and osteocarcinoma Saos-2 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Discrepant effects on the Wnt pathway have been observed for other Wnt regulator genes. For example, Dkk2 activates Wnt signaling when coexpressed with certain Frizzled and LRP6 receptors but inhibits Wnt signaling in other situations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Wnt1 also activates canonical Wnt signaling in some cell lines but inhibits Wnt signaling in others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Furthermore, the non-canonical Wnt/Ca<sup>2+ </sup>pathway activator Wnt5a activates canonical Wnt signaling in HEK293 cells when the co-receptors Fz4 and LRP5 are over-expressed, but inhibits canonical signaling in the absence of these receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Therefore, Wnt signaling activation in vitro, and potentially also in vivo, is not a sole property of the ligand or regulator but appears to be related to other factors, including receptor availability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><p>Receptor context influences the regulation of canonical Wnt signaling by Dkk2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and Wnt5a [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], suggesting that specific receptor components in HEK293 and M&#x000fc;ller glia, such as a putative Dkk3 receptor, may mediate the Wnt-inducing activity of Dkk3. Absence or lower expression of these components may cause its inhibitory activity in COS7 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) and PC12 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and its inactivity in other assays. Although Dkk3 activity was blocked by Dkk1 coexpression in HEK293 cells, the mechanism of Wnt modulation by Dkk3 may differ from Dkk1 and Dkk2 because Dkk3 does not bind to Kremen or LRP proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Future studies will investigate the factors that are required for Dkk3 activity.</p><p>We demonstrated that Dkk3 has pro-survival properties in HEK293 cells but not in COS7 cells. This cellular difference between Dkk3 protection also suggests that COS7 cells lack the appropriate Dkk3 receptors, although this cell type does express endogenous Dkk3 (data not shown). Although the Wnt pathway itself is protective in most tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], Dkk3-mediated cellular protection is unlikely to be dependent on Wnt signaling because Wnt3a was not added in the apoptosis assays. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that low levels of Wnt activators are present in the culture serum.</p><p>Several reports demonstrated that Dkk3 regulates cell death in cancer cells, protecting osteocarcinoma cells against serum starvation and chemotherapy agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] but inducing apoptosis in liver cancer cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. In our study, Dkk3 expression alone did not increase basal viability, suggesting that it plays a reactive role after apoptosis has begun. Interestingly, <italic>dkk3</italic>-deficient mice did not display any phenotypes that would indicate defects in cell survival or altered Wnt signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Furthermore, these mice had normal retinal development. If Dkk3 is protective only in response to retinal injury then tissue damage may be required to reveal a phenotype. Alternatively, Dkk3-mediated protection may be limited to specific cell types in culture.</p><p>M&#x000fc;ller glia secrete pro-survival growth factors during retinal degeneration that are believed to rescue remaining photoreceptors in a toxic environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. We recently demonstrated that Wnt signaling is upregulated during retinal degeneration in M&#x000fc;ller glia and Wnt activators protect primary photoreceptor cultures from apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. The localization of Dkk3 to M&#x000fc;ller glia and its increased expression during retinal degeneration, combined with the functional properties identified above, raise the intriguing possibility that Dkk3 may be a component of M&#x000fc;ller glia-mediated retinal protection. Such protection could occur directly by acting on vulnerable photoreceptors, or indirectly by activating Wnt signaling. The glia may secrete Dkk3 in vivo which could then increase Wnt signaling in fellow glia or in neighboring cell types. Although the cell lines are not an appropriate model for photoreceptors, we have achieved our goal of defining roles of Dkk3 in cultured cells as a first approach towards determining the potential activity of Dkk3 in the retina. Manipulating Dkk3 expression in normal and degenerating retina will provide insight the role of Dkk3 in the retina.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Reagents</title><p>Dkk1 and Dkk3 expression vectors were generously provided by Dr. Niehrs (Heidelberg, Germany) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].

The Dkk3 stable cell line was established by transfecting HEK293 cells with Dkk3 in the pcDNA3 vector and selecting for clones using geneticin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The control "Vector" line was made in parallel by transfecting with the empty vector. Transfections used Lipofectamine (Invitrogen), electroporation or buffered calcium phosphate, according to standard procedures.</p><p>Canonical Wnt signaling was induced by incubation with conditioned media (CM) prepared from mouse L-cells stably expressing Wnt3a (ATCC). The CM was filtered and mixed 1:1 with normal media for use. Dkk3-containing conditioned media was prepared from HEK293 cells stably expressing Dkk3. The control conditioned media for Wnt3a was from parental L-cells and for Dkk3 it was from the HEK293 "Vector" cell line. The following primary antibodies were used: rabbit anti-glutamate synthetase (Sigma, 1:500), Dkk3 polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz, 1:100) and Dkk3 monoclonal antibody (R&#x00026;D, 1:500).</p></sec><sec><title>Wnt activity assays</title><p>Cells were co-transfected with the Dkk plasmid, the TOP-FLASH luciferase reporter plasmid (a generous gift from Dr. R.

The endogenous &#x003b2;-catenin/Tcf transcriptional complex binds to Tcf sequences upstream of the enzyme luciferase in the TOP-FLASH plasmid vector, driving luciferase expression upon Wnt pathway activation. The mutated FOP-FLASH plasmid was used as a control and did not have luciferase activity in transfected cells treated with Wnt3a (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). Forty-eight hours after transfection the cells were incubated with Wnt3a conditioned media or control conditioned media for 16&#x02013;24 hours and lysates were collected in Reporter lysis buffer (Promega). Luciferase activity was measured in a Lumistar Galaxy luminometer (BMG Labtech) and normalized to &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].

One hundred percent of the cells in the culture were identified as M&#x000fc;ller glia based on morphology and immunostaining for the M&#x000fc;ller glia marker glutamine synthetase (GS) and the lack of immunodetection for other cell-specific marker proteins.
