While the best-studied target genes are the Hox genes of the Antennapedia and Bithorax complexes, a large number of key developmental genes are also Polycomb (Pc) targets, indicating a widespread role for this maintenance machinery in cell fate determination. We have studied the linkage between the binding of PcG proteins and the developmental regulation of gene expression using whole-genome mapping to identify sites bound by the PcG proteins, Pc and Pleiohomeotic (Pho), in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo and in a more restricted tissue, the imaginal discs of the third thoracic segment. Our data provide support for the idea that Pho is a general component of the maintenance machinery, since the majority of Pc targets are also associated with Pho binding. We find, in general, considerable developmental stability of Pc and Pho binding at target genes and observe that Pc/Pho binding can be associated with both expressed and inactive genes. In particular, at the Hox complexes, both active and inactive genes have significant Pc and Pho binding. However, in comparison to inactive genes, the active Hox genes show reduced and altered binding profiles. During development, Pc target genes are not simply constantly associated with Pc/Pho binding, and we identify sets of genes with clear differential binding between embryo and imaginal disc. Using existing datasets, we show that for specific fate-determining genes of the haemocyte lineage, the active state is characterised by lack of Pc binding. Overall, our analysis suggests a dynamic relationship between Pc/Pho binding and gene transcription. Pc/Pho binding does not preclude transcription, but levels of Pc/Pho binding change during development, and loss of Pc/Pho binding can be associated with both stable gene activity and inactivity.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Cells make fate decisions as they progressively differentiate into specific cell types during development. The stability of these decisions is important and is achieved, in part, by changes to the chromatin that packages DNA in the nucleus. A key set of protein complexes that together constitute the Polycomb-group/Trithorax-group (PcG/TrxG) machinery is involved in chromatin modification and is known to operate at a large number of genes involved in developmental decisions. The PcG proteins establish stable gene repression, whereas the TrxG counteract the PcG to enable gene activation. How this PcG/TrxG balance works is not understood. By mapping PcG protein binding to chromatin in vivo, we show, in general, a relatively constant association of PcG protein at target genes during development. However, we also find changes in binding at specific genes. While some of these changes are consistent with a loss of PcG proteins associated with gene expression, we also find examples where PcG proteins are present at active genes and not present at inactive genes. Our analysis supports the idea that simply the presence of PcG proteins at a target gene does not necessarily result in gene repression and suggests a more dynamic balance between PcG protein binding and gene expression.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="15"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>As the cells of the embryo progress along developmental pathways they make fate decisions, becoming committed to particular lineages and ultimately to a specific differentiated cell state. Although cell fate decisions may be triggered by transient signals, the resultant cell states are generally stable and are maintained through time and cell division. A long-standing paradigm for understanding the mechanisms underlying the stability of cell fate decisions has been the maintenance of Hox gene expression through gene silencing by Polycomb-group (PcG) genes in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000178-Ringrose1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>). Hox gene expression domains, initiated in the early embryo through active transcriptional regulation by the transiently-expressed products of the segmentation genes, are thereafter maintained throughout the rest of development and adult life by the maintenance machinery of the PcG and Trithorax-group (TrxG) genes. The products of the PcG genes build the Polycomb Repressive Complexes (PRC1 and PRC2) that are required for gene silencing, whereas the TrxG genes are required for the maintenance of gene activation (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000178-Schuettengruber1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>). In this paradigm, the balance between gene repression and activation is set once and thereafter stably remembered.</p><p>A more dynamic view of the role of PcG silencing has recently been emerging, largely from work with embryonic stem cells, where several PcG genes have been shown to be required for both embryonic and adult stem cell maintenance (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000178-Molofsky1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>). Genome-wide analysis of the targets of PRC1 and PRC2 complex components reveals that a large number of genes with roles in cell fate decisions and cell differentiation are bound by PcG gene products in stem cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000178-Boyer1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000178-Lee1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Many of these genes are repressed by PcG proteins since loss or down-regulation of PcG genes results in their derepression. Upon stem cell differentiation many repressed genes become activated and some concomitantly lose binding of PcG complexes. In stem cells many developmental genes exhibit a &#x0201c;poised&#x0201d; bivalent chromatin organisation, carrying both repressive and active chromatin modifications <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000178-Bernstein1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000178-Mikkelsen1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. The repressive H3K27me3 histone modification, dependent on the PRC2 complex, is lost from many genes on differentiation. Thus PcG silencing appears to maintain the stem cell state via repression of cytodifferentiation genes; this repression is not permanent and can be lifted upon receipt of differentiation signals.</p><p>When the human embryonic teratocarcinoma cell line NT2/D1 is induced to undergo neural differentiation by exposure to retinoic acid, two different scenarios are observed for PcG regulation of target genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000178-Bracken1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. For PcG target genes activated during neuronal differentiation (e.g. the neuronal transcription factor ZIC1 and the neurofilament light chain gene, NEFL), PcG proteins are associated with these genes prior to activation but are lost upon differentiation. In contrast, for PcG target genes repressed during differentiation (e.g. the pro-neural transcription factors OLIG2 and NEUROG2), PcG proteins are already associated with these genes in undifferentiated cells, even though the genes are expressed, and the Polycomb complexes remain after differentiation when expression is switched off. Thus it appears that, at some genes, the association of Polycomb complexes with target genes can change dramatically upon differentiation, but the presence of Polycomb complexes does not always accord with transcriptional repression.</p><p>PcG target genes have been identified in <italic>Drosophila</italic> by genome-wide mapping of PcG protein binding in tissue culture cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000178-Schwartz1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000178-Tolhuis1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref> and by more limited genomic mapping (across 10 Mb of <italic>Drosophila</italic> euchromatin) with different developmental stages in vivo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000178-Negre1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. In this latter study, examples of target genes with clear developmental changes in PcG protein association were identified, suggesting that the chromosome association profile of Polycomb complexes in <italic>Drosophila</italic> may be more dynamic than previously thought.</p><p>Here we extend these studies, presenting a genome-wide analysis of PcG proteins in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos and in imaginal discs from the third thoracic segment.

Analysis of tissue derived specifically from the third thoracic (T3) segment allows us to examine Pc and Pho association with Hox genes that are known to be either active or inactive in this segment.

At a gross level, comparison of the binding profiles, e.g. across chromosome 3R as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000178-g001">Figure 1</xref>, reveals considerable similarity, suggesting that Pc and Pho are generally bound at the same locations and that their binding sites appear relatively constant with little change between embryo and imaginal disc.</p><fig id="pgen-1000178-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1000178.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Overview of binding profiles on chromosome 3R.</title><p>Log<sub>2</sub> enrichment ratios are plotted for Pc and Pho in embryos and T3 imaginal discs.

As well as counting binding events directly over transcription units, intergenic events were separately ascribed to the nearest transcript.

Pc is often associated with a broad binding domain extending over tens of kilobases whereas Pho binding is characterised by much narrower isolated peaks. Since the sharp Pho peaks identify relatively short regions associated with Pho binding we searched for enriched sequence motifs underlying these peaks. In addition to Pho, several other DNA-binding proteins, including GAGA factor and Zeste, are associated with PREs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000178-Dejardin1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000178-Ringrose2">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. We were interested to see if Pho-bound sequences exhibited the canonical Pho binding motif, as well as putative binding sites for these other factors.</p><p>We learned motif dictionaries from the central areas of 150 strong Pc-associated Pho peaks using various search parameters. The searches identified more than 70 partially redundant sequence motifs and we selected 18 of these for further analysis, based on their length, information content and/or similarity to known binding sites of Pho, GAGA and Zeste (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000178-g003">Figure 3</xref>, see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000178.s007">Table S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000178.s010">Dataset S1</xref>). Binding sites of additional factors known to be involved in Pc recruitment (e.g. Grainy head) could not be identified. We found Pho-type motifs comprising a core GCCAT sequence with a more or less pronounced tail of four Ts. In addition, we found a novel TGGCC motif that may be related to the Pho-type as it has a GCC core (and GCCA on the reverse strand) but which lacks the tail of Ts. We also found a frequently occurring GTT repeat and a CGCACT sequence motif. The GAGA- and Zeste-type motifs differ in that Zeste-like motifs have a pronounced &#x0201c;GAG&#x0201d;, however we recognise that this classification is somewhat arbitrary.</p><fig id="pgen-1000178-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1000178.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Sequence motifs identified in Pho-bound regions.</title><p>(A) Selection of 18 motifs chosen for further analysis. The motifs can largely be grouped into clusters of similarity to the canonical Pho, GAGA and Zeste binding sites. The TGGCC motifs form a distinct class related to the canonical Pho motif. The GAGA- and Zeste-like motifs differ as Zeste-like motifs have a pronounced &#x0201c;GAG&#x0201d;, although this classification is arbitrary. Motifs are named according to class with a suffix indicating motif length. (B) Motif over-representation heat map. For each motif, a search for sequence matches with decreasing similarity (sub-optimal bit score) was conducted. The over-representation is measured as a Z-score, comparing the number of actual Pho peaks containing the motif to the number of occurrences in a random data set. This analysis confirms the statistical over-representation of all motifs, and suggests cutoff values for the sub-optimal bit score. (C) Bi-clustering of motif occurrence in 628 embryonic Pho peaks. Each column represents one of the 18 selected motifs, each line one of 628 embryonic Pho peaks. Rows and columns are ordered according to similarity. Motif presence better than the motif-specific sub-optimal bit score is denoted as a black mark. The motif type is indicated below the diagram. Peaks in region indicated by (a) have long Pho/TGGCC motifs but lack long GAGA/Zeste motifs while the peaks in region (b) show the opposite.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pgen.1000178.g003"/></fig><p>The selected motifs were significantly over-represented when we compared their occurrence in all Pho peaks to random sets of sequences that were not occupied by Pho (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000178-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). While longer motifs with positions of low information content are mostly over-represented when allowing for mismatches, short sequence motifs are only over-represented when considering perfect matches or small sub-optimal bit scores. This over-representation approach also enabled us to derive informed cutoff values for further analyses; for each motif we identified the sub-optimal bit score for which the motif shows the strongest evidence for over-representation. Using these cutoff values, we determined the presence of the different motif types in all 628 embryonic Pho peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000178-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). The short motifs (clustered to the right of the diagram) are well represented in the Pho peak sequences; 85&#x00025; of the sequences contain Pho_6, 63&#x00025; contain GAGA_6 and 64&#x00025; contain Zeste_7. Longer Pho and TGGCC motifs occur in 51&#x00025; of the peaks and have an interesting antagonistic clustering to the longer GAGA and Zeste-type motifs; i.e. peaks containing longer Pho/TGGCC-type motifs (region A in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000178-g003">Figure 3C</xref>) cluster separately from peaks containing longer GAGA/Zeste-type (region B). Overall, the general association of Pho, GAGA and Zeste binding motifs with Pho binding is consistent with the clustering of these motifs previously used to predict PREs in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000178-Ringrose2">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref> and we add novel enriched sequences that may improve such approaches. However, we emphasise that there is considerable variability in the motif occurrence at Pho peaks as we illustrate for representative peaks in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000178.s002">Figure S2</xref>.</p><p>We were interested to determine if there was any qualitative difference in motif composition between Pc-associated and Pho-only peaks. We compared the number of peaks containing particular motifs for both these peak classes and tested for significance using chi-square statistics.

This observation highlights the potential importance of a long Pho motif at the Pho-only sites.

Despite the overall similarity comparing the embryo, T3 disc and S2 cell chromatin samples, there are clear differences in Pc occupancy for some genes indicating potential sites of differential Pc activity. To reduce the level of artificially selected differential Pc targets resulting from automatic selection of peaks in the high-throughput analysis, we visually screened the binding profiles of all differentially bound regions and restricted our further analysis to differential gene sets that show significant enrichment of GO categories. We identify three robust sets of differentially occupied genes. We find 49 genes that are bound by Pc in the embryo but are not Pc-associated in imaginal discs, 107 genes that are bound by Pc in the embryo but not in S2 cells and 119 genes that are bound by Pc in imaginal disc but not in S2 cells.</p><p>By examining the genes in these differentially-bound sets we anticipated that we might identify cell fate-determining genes for cell fate decisions in particular developmental pathways. For example, genes bound by Pc in the embryo but not in imaginal discs might represent genes released from Pc silencing on the pathway of disc development and hence might represent key cell-fate determining genes for that pathway. However, the GO analysis of these gene sets (summarised in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000178-g005">Figure 5</xref> (also see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000178.s008">Table S3</xref>)) presents a striking observation. The Pc target genes that are unoccupied by Pc in a particular tissue appear to have little to do with cell fate decisions that are relevant for that tissue. For example, the genes occupied by Pc in the embryo but not in the imaginal discs are enriched in genes involved in fate decisions in neuroblasts of the central nervous system. Similarly the genes that are occupied in embryos but not in S2 cells, which are mesodermally&#x02013;derived cells of the haemocyte lineage, are genes required for ectodermal and neural fate decisions.

For this gene set, target occupancy in the S2 cells is similar to that observed in imaginal discs with only a few targets (14&#x00025;) showing Pc binding.

Mutant clones lacking <italic>pho</italic> (together with <italic>pleiohomeotic like</italic> which functions largely redundantly with <italic>pho</italic>) show not only loss of Hox gene silencing but also growth defects that result in the elimination of the clones from the disc epithelium. Clones lacking dSfmbt lose Hox silencing but do not show growth defects. Recently, Pho was found to be bound at active genes and is strongly recruited at sites with high transcription (chromosome puffs) on salivary gland polytene chromosomes. Based on the kinetics of Pho binding at heat-shock loci a role for Pho in the repression of previously active genes was proposed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000178-Beisel1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Examination of Pc and Pho binding in the BX-C in T3 imaginal discs provides a clear test case for the linkage between occupancy and gene expression since <italic>Ubx</italic> is expressed but <italic>abd-A</italic> and <italic>Abd-B</italic> are silenced. We find significant Pc and Pho binding associated with both the expressed and the silenced genes. This provides a clear demonstration that silencing is not simply established by the presence of PcG proteins at a target site and supports previous observations of a lack of correlation between PcG binding and gene silencing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000178-Papp1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000178-Beisel1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000178-Ringrose3">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. Although the <italic>Ubx</italic> gene is associated with significant Pc and Pho binding, there is overall less binding over <italic>Ubx</italic> in comparison with the two silenced genes. Also, the Pho binding profile in the embryo, representing a mixture of gene activity states, is markedly different from the T3 disc profile; the T3 profile shows prominent peaks at the <italic>bx</italic> and <italic>bxd</italic> PREs but the other peaks seen with embryo chromatin are less prominent. Similar effects are also seen at the <italic>Antp</italic> gene, which is also active in T3 discs. Reduction and rearrangement, rather than absence, of PcG protein at active genes suggests a dynamic interaction between silencing and gene transcription. Indeed, Pc complexes have been shown to be highly dynamic with rapid exchange of PcG proteins on chromatin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000178-Ficz1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. Alteration of the Pho binding profile at Hox genes in cell lines with differential Hox expression has also been reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000178-Beisel1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref> with the striking observation of spreading of the Pho binding at active loci. Such dramatic Pho spreading is, however, not apparent in our data.</p><p>We identified a set of 49 Pc target genes that were bound by Pc in the embryo but not in the T3 imaginal discs. We had expected that such a class might contain genes required for fate decisions on the pathway to T3 imaginal disc cell differentiation and were surprised to find that this gene set was enriched in genes required for early cell fate decisions in the nervous system. We examined the expression of several of these genes and found little or no expression in the T3 discs, reinforcing the idea that Pc binding does not simply correlate with silencing of gene expression. In the case of <italic>Ubx</italic> and <italic>Antp</italic> we find that expressed genes have significant Pc binding and, with the set of genes that show Pc association in embryos but not in imaginal discs, we find inactive genes that lack Pc. This is reminiscent of an observation with the Pc target <italic>hedgehog</italic> (<italic>hh</italic>) which has an identified PRE and is silenced by PcG in the embryo and imaginal discs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000178-Maurange1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000178-Chanas1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>; in salivary gland polytene chromosomes, Chanas and Maschat found no PcG binding at the <italic>hh</italic> gene despite the fact that <italic>hh</italic> is not expressed in this tissue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000178-Chanas1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. A similar observation was made for CycA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000178-Martinez1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>. In this case we note that although <italic>hh</italic> is a clear Pc target in S2 cells and in our in vivo analysis, CycA is not <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000178-Schwartz1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. In all of these cases of differential Pc binding it is possible that the particular genes are inactive due to the absence of appropriate transcription factors to drive expression in particular tissues. This contrasts with the situation in the Hox genes where Pc is continuously required to maintain silencing against a background presence of gene activators <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000178-Busturia2">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000178-Beuchle1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>. If Pc complexes are only recruited to genes where they are required to counteract gene activation, this would provide an economical way to deploy the silencing machinery. It would also imply the existence of a mechanism that enables the PcG-machinery to identify genes that are capable of being activated. A possible basis for this mechanism could be the targeting of Polycomb complexes by non-coding RNAs; PcG proteins are recruited by non-coding RNAs in mammalian X chromosome inactivation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000178-Plath1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref> and recent studies implicate non-coding RNA in Hox gene repression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000178-Petruk1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000178-Rinn1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>. Alternatively, the lack of Pc associated with non-expressed genes may indicate that these genes are repressed through non-PcG dependent mechanisms. In the case of <italic>hh</italic> in the salivary glands, there is some support for this since attempts to activate <italic>hh</italic> by supplying activators were unsuccessful <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000178-Chanas1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, a study on histone modifications and cell lineage provided evidence for a class of genes that lose both the PcG-dependent H3K27me3 mark associated with silencing and the TrxG&#x02013;dependent H3K4me3 mark associated with activation on lineage progression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000178-Mikkelsen1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. Loss of both marks was found to be associated with gene inactivity.</p><p>In the case of the haemocyte lineage cell fate-determining genes required for plasmatocyte development, these genes are expressed in S2 cells and are found to be selectively unoccupied by Pc. This is what would be expected for a non-silenced active gene and fits with the idea that Pc is lost from PRE/TREs following switching to the active state. However it raises the question of why <italic>Ubx</italic> or <italic>Antp</italic>, as genes expressed in T3 imaginal disc cells, are still associated with significant Pc binding whereas a Pc target gene such as <italic>srp</italic> appears to lack Pc binding in haemocyte lineage cells. S2 cells are tissue culture cells whose gene regulatory systems may have deviated considerably from the endogenous state and it is therefore possible that the observed Pc status represents a tissue culture artefact. However, another possibility is that it relates to plasticity. Imaginal disc cells are relatively undifferentiated precursor cells that only differentiate fully during metamorphosis. S2 cells, on the other hand, may represent a more committed cell state. In this respect it is interesting to compare the Pc profiles observed at the BX-C in S2 cells and T3 imaginal discs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000178-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). S2 cells express high levels of <italic>Abd-B</italic> but very low levels of <italic>Ubx</italic> and <italic>abd-A</italic>. Pc binding reflects this gene expression and in particular shows no binding over an <italic>Abd-B</italic> domain that includes the four active <italic>Abd-B</italic> promoters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000178-Schwartz1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. This contrasts with the situation in T3 imaginal discs where the active <italic>Ubx</italic> gene is associated with significant Pc binding. However, it should be noted that the state of Hox gene expression in S2 cells is rather curious since these cells are thought to derive from the head mesoderm, an area of the embryo that does not express any of the genes of the BX-C. Despite this caveat, the differences in the Pc binding at active genes in S2 versus imaginal disc cells may reflect the plasticity of the undifferentiated imaginal disc cells compared to the loss of plasticity in the S2 cells. In general, we have identified two situations where Pc target genes are not bound by Pc proteins, a set of inactive genes in imaginal discs and a set of active genes in S2 cells and the common feature may be that these both represent terminal stable gene states. In these situations, loss of Pc binding may be associated with loss of plasticity and may indicate final cell commitment.</p><p>Our analysis of T3 imaginal discs enabled us to investigate the Pc occupancy of genes in this specific tissue but does not immediately reveal the developmental history of these cells in terms of which cell fate switches had been turned on and which had been turned off along the developmental pathway leading to T3 imaginal epidermal specification. The Pc target genes which exhibited no Pc binding in the T3 imaginal discs did not obviously suggest a set of fate-determining genes for T3 disc specification. In the relatively undifferentiated imaginal disc cells it is apparent that Pc occupancy by itself does not differentiate a silenced from an active state and so to map the fate switching history of a cell we will either need to find markers that provide a clearer readout of the state of gene activation or else we will have to look at more differentiated cells where the PcG system has stabilised. Our analysis of a limited set of adult tissues, where gene expression data is available, provides support for stable activation of cell fate decision genes, suggesting that examining the expression of Pc target genes in differentiated cell types can provide information on the key developmental genes that are activated on a specific developmental pathway. Although the T3 imaginal discs represent a tissue sample of limited cell fate diversity they are nevertheless a complex mixture of cells with different states of gene activity. Many of the known key genes in imaginal disc development e.g. <italic>vg, Dll, hh</italic> and <italic>tsh</italic> are active in only a subset of disc cells and therefore the Pc and Pho binding profiles we observe may represent a mixture of active and silenced states. Further analysis examining more restricted tissues will be required to investigate to what extent the Pc target genes provide a stable &#x0201c;genetic address&#x0201d; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000178-GarciaBellido1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref> specifying cell differentiation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Fly Stocks and Antibodies</title><p>The wild type strain used was OregonR.

For the Negre et al. data we follow their target criteria: a FDR less than 10&#x00025; for both Pc and Ph. Targets for the pupal stage are not plotted as, for this stage, only Pc FDR data are available. The first two columns show our Pc targets for the T3 imaginal disc and embryo chromatin, the last three columns show the Negre et al. PRC1 targets for embryo, adult female and adult male chromatin. Our data show very similar profiles of Pc binding between embryo and disc chromatin with only one gene showing differential binding. The Negre et al. embryo data show considerable overlap with our data; 5 out of 7 of our embryo targets are also identified in the Negre et al. data. The adult profiles are more divergent; however we note that two genes, CG4218 and osp, that are only bound in the adult samples in the Negre et al. data are identified as targets in our embryo data, suggesting that they are unlikely to be truly differential targets. As pointed out by Negre et al. the adult male chromatin appears to have a markedly different profile of Pc binding than the other samples.</p><p>(0.41 MB EPS)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pgen.1000178.s004.eps" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="postscript"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pgen.1000178.s005"><label>Figure S5</label><caption><p>FlyAtlas cluster diagram.</p><p>(1.44 MB EPS)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pgen.1000178.s005.eps" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="postscript"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pgen.1000178.s006"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p>Summary of Pc and Pho binding by gene.
