Our 5&#x02032;-RACE gel electrophoresis failed to reveal a PCR band for the major transcript variant v1 in brain and testis tissues, probably due to the presence of a too large exon 1 (&#x0223c;1-kb) for v1, which would result in low amplification efficiency. Thus, we performed further RT-PCR using the 5&#x02032;-RACE product of brain and testis as template and primers specific to v1 (v1F/R4 and v1F0/R4; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002990-g001">Fig. 1C right panel</xref>), to check whether v1 was expressed in normal tissues.

We did not find any obvious CGI or predicted promoter in the region upstream of the exon 1 of v2, indicating that either the v2 promoter is not a typical one or the published 5&#x02032;-end sequence of v2 is not complete yet. Thus, we focused on the role of promoter CGI methylation in the silencing of <italic>OPCML</italic>-v1. We first validated that our methylation-specific PCR (MSP) was specific, which did not give any non-specific signal for the unbisulfate DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002990-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>) and revealed the methylation of <italic>OPCML</italic>-v1 in silenced placenta tissue (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0002990.s003">Figure S2</xref>). Next, v1 promoter methylation was detected in most tumor cell lines with downregulated or silenced expression (6/6 nasopharyngeal, 15/17 esophageal, 5/5 lung, 17/17 gastric, 11/11 colorectal, 6/13

As a cell adhesion molecule, <italic>OPCML</italic> comprises several protein-protein interaction domains, such as three &#x02018;C2&#x02019; like Ig domains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002990-Shark1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref> which are more appropriately classified as &#x02018;I&#x02019; set Ig domains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002990-Sellar1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, commonly found in cell-surface-adhesion and receptor molecules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002990-Harpaz1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. Through these domains, <italic>OPCML</italic> may bind directly to growth promoting or inhibitory molecules and modulate their functions in tumor cells. Among the IgLON family, <italic>OPCML</italic> was the first member reported to possess tumor suppressor functions in epithelial ovarian cancer, being frequently silenced genetically and epigenetically at the early step of ovarian carcinogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002990-Sellar1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. This was followed by another report that another IgLON, <italic>LSAMP</italic>, is also a TSG for renal clear cell carcinoma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002990-Chen1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. Our present study further verifies that <italic>OPCML</italic> can function as a broad TSG and is frequently inactivated epigenetically in multiple carcinomas and lymphomas, including NPC, esophageal, lung, gastric, hepatocellular, colorectal, breast, cervical and prostate carcinomas. <italic>OPCML</italic> probably functions as a tumor suppressor through interacting with other IgLONs to form heterodimeric complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002990-Reed2">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref> involved in signal transduction. Loss of OPCML reduces the intercellular adhesion and heterodimeric complex formation and thus impairs the corresponding signaling pathways, thereby promoting the progress of carcinogenesis.</p><p><italic>OPCML</italic> shares the highest homology to <italic>HNT</italic> among the four IgLON family members. Notably, the coding region in exon 1 of <italic>OPCML</italic>-v1 and <italic>HNT</italic> is identical, and so is the exon 2 except for only several bases. The first Ig domains of these two proteins share 92&#x00025; identity, while the second and third Ig domains share 70&#x00025; and 66&#x00025; identity, respectively. This raises the possibility that <italic>OPCML</italic> and <italic>HNT</italic> may originate from the same ancestor by gene conversion during evolution. Thus, primers must be cautiously designed for these two genes to avoid cross-amplification with PCR-based techniques.</p><p>Our results also reveal that <italic>OPCML</italic> transcripts v1 and v2 have different tissue expression patterns. Whereas <italic>OPCML</italic>-v1 was widely expressed in normal adult tissues, <italic>OPCML</italic>-v2 showed a more tissue-specific expression profile, being highly expressed in few tissues including brain. Previously, a genome-wide searching for the neuron specific silencer REST/NRSF binding sites (RE1/NRSE) revealed that there were three NRSE located at intron 1 of <italic>OPCML</italic>-v2 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bioinformatics.leeds.ac.uk/group/online/RE1db/re1db_home.htm">http://bioinformatics.leeds.ac.uk/group/online/RE1db/re1db_home.htm</ext-link>), suggesting that v2 may be a more neuron specific transcript. We also identified other novel isoforms of <italic>OPCML</italic> (v3, v4, v5, v6), derived from alternative splicing or promoter usages. Using primers specific to the common exons of <italic>OPCML</italic> transcripts, we found the expression of <italic>OPCML</italic> in several tumor cell lines (Hep3B, H292, SW480, L1236), where the <italic>OPCML</italic>-v1 and v2 were totally silenced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002990-g001">Fig. 1F</xref>), indicating transcription of <italic>OPCML</italic> from alternative unknown promoters. Our present study mainly focused on the expression and functional analysis of transcript variant 1, whereas the mechanism of variant 2 silencing was not pursued further. Further studies are needed to characterize these novel splicing variants, their promoter usages and possible biologic functions.</p><p>Epigenetic gene silencing is associated with the onset and progression of various cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002990-Jones1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. The frequent, predominant epigenetic inactivation of <italic>OPCML</italic> in multiple malignancies points to the importance of this gene in tumorigenesis. <italic>OPCML</italic> is a stress- and p53-responsive gene, but this response was often epigenetically impaired by promoter methylation. We speculate that epigenetic silencing of <italic>OPCML</italic> would impair the cellular protective response to environmental stresses in normal cells, thus promoting the development of cancers. As promoter methylation of <italic>OPCML</italic> was pharmacologically and genetically reversible, pharmacologic demethylation therapy will restore its response to stress and p53. The role of <italic>OPCML</italic> in DNA damage repair, apoptosis and cell cycle arrest with respect to stress response remains to be further investigated. We also noticed that in some cell lines (like HCC), <italic>OPMCL</italic>-v1 was silenced without promoter methylation detected by MSP. It could be that for some cell lines, the methylation is not evenly distributed through the CGI (like HepG2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002990-g003">Fig. 3</xref>) and is thus missed by MSP analysis, or additional alternative mechanism such as histone modification is involved.</p><p>In summary, we found that the expression of <italic>OPCML</italic>-v1 (NM_002545), a major transcript of this TSG, is frequently silenced or down-regulated in multiple tumors. This inactivation is due to its promoter methylation, which further impairs its response to environmental stresses. We further demonstrated that <italic>OPCML</italic> acts as a broad tumor suppressor for multiple tumor types. The high incidence of epigenetic inactivation of <italic>OPCML</italic> in NPC and esophageal carcinoma, both prevalent in our locality, indicates that <italic>OPCML</italic> methylation could be an epigenetic biomarker for the molecular diagnosis of these tumors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cell lines, tumor and normal tissue samples</title><p>A series of tumor cell lines were studied, including nasopharyngeal-NPC, esophageal, lung, gastric, colorectal, hepatocellular, breast, cervical and prostate carcinomas, glioma, Hodgkin and non-Hodgkin lymphomas, including Burkitt lymphoma (BL), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), T-cell lymphoma (TL) and NK/T-cell lymphoma (NL) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002990-Jin1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002990-Jin2">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002990-Ying1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>.
