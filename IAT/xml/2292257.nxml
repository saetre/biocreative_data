The LIM-homeobox gene <italic>Lhx2</italic> is a candidate regulator of fetal hematopoiesis since it is expressed in the fetal liver and <italic>Lhx2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice die in utero due to severe anemia. Moreover, expression of Lhx2 in embryonic stem (ES) cell-derived embryoid bodies (EBs) can lead to the generation of HSC-like cell lines. To further define the role of this transcription factor in hematopoietic regulation, we generated ES cell lines that enabled tet-inducible expression of Lhx2. Using this approach we observed that Lhx2 expression synergises with specific signalling pathways, resulting in increased frequency of colony forming cells in developing EB cells. The increase in growth factor-responsive progenitor cells directly correlates to the efficiency in generating HSC-like cell lines, suggesting that Lhx2 expression induce self-renewal of a distinct multipotential hematopoietic progenitor cell in EBs. Signalling via the c-kit tyrosine kinase receptor and the gp130 signal transducer by IL-6 is necessary and sufficient for the Lhx2 induced self-renewal. While inducing self-renewal of multipotential progenitor cells, expression of Lhx2 inhibited proliferation of primitive erythroid precursor cells and interfered with early ES cell commitment, indicating striking lineage specificity of this effect.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The mammalian hematopoietic system continuously generate large numbers of functional erythroid, myeloid and lymphoid cells throughout life.

EryP cells are nucleated producing the embryonic form of hemoglobin and this stage of embryonic hematopoiesis is referred to as primitive hematopoiesis. The close association between hematopoietic cells and vascular endothelium in the blood islands led Sabin almost a century ago to postulate a common progenitor cell for these cell types referred to as the hemangioblast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002025-Sabin1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, and a progenitor cell with hemangioblast properties has recently been identified <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002025-Choi1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002025-Huber1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>.

The receptor tyrosine kinase c-kit and its ligand Stem Cell Factor (SCF, also c-kit ligand, Steel factor or mast cell growth factor) are essential for hematopoietic development since mice lacking functional c-kit (<italic>White Spotting</italic> or <italic>W</italic> mutants) or SCF (<italic>Steel</italic> or <italic>Sl</italic> mutants) die of a severe anemia <italic>in utero</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002025-Russell1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002025-Nocka1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>.

Thus, signalling from the c-kit receptor and the gp130 signal transducer play an import role in the development of the hematopoietic system as well as for stem and progenitor cell function, but molecular mechanisms modulating the activities of, and the interplay between these receptors in stem cells remains to be elucidated.</p><p>Analyses of early mouse development is hampered by the inaccessibility of the early embryo and the limited amount of tissues at these stages. These aspects can be circumvented by using the embryonic stem (ES) cell system since ES cells can be differentiated <italic>in vitro</italic> into cystic structures called embryoid bodies (EBs), and this process mimic the essential features of the gastrulation process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002025-Gadue1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. Similar to the embryo, the first hematopoietic precursor cell population to develop in EBs is a transient wave of the EryP lineage followed by the development of progenitor cells of the various definitive hematopoietic lineages (EryD and myeloid) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002025-Keller2">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover, a progenitor cell population showing hemangioblast characteristics that appears prior to the development of primitive and definitive hematopoietic progenitor cell populations, has been identified in the ES system as well as in the embryo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002025-Choi1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002025-Huber1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, the ES/EB system represents a reliable and reproducible model system for analysing the development and regulation of the early embryonic hematopoietic system.</p><p>We have previously shown that expression of the LIM-homeobox gene <italic>Lhx2</italic> (MGI:96785, NM_010710) in hematopoietic progenitor cells derived from ES cells differentiated <italic>in vitro</italic> can promote self-renewal of a rare SCF-responsive progenitor cells present in EBs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002025-Pintodo1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. These progenitor cells could be identified in clonal assays and used to establish SCF-dependent multipotential definitive hematopoietic progenitor cell (HPC) lines sharing many basic properties with normal early fetal HSCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002025-Pintodo1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002025-Carlsson1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. However, these experiments were carried out by retroviral delivery of the Lhx2 cDNA to the cells and a putative contribution to the observed phenotype by inactivation of tumour suppressor genes or activation of oncogenes caused by retroviral integration has not been excluded. Moreover, expression from retroviral vectors in ES cells differentiated <italic>in vitro</italic> is very inefficient <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002025-Pintodo1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002025-Laker1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>, and therefore it is not possible by using the retroviral system to systematically analyse the effects of Lhx2 expression in the ES/EB system. Thus, expression of Lhx2 can generate HSC-like cell lines but the specificity and efficiency of this event is not known.</p><p>To further address the role of Lhx2 in during embryonic development of the hematopoietic system, we have introduced Lhx2 cDNA into Ainv15 ES cells where its expression is efficiently regulated by a Tet-on system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002025-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002025-Kyba1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>. Lhx2 expression directly induce self-renewal of a distinct multipotent progenitor cell within EBs in synergy with specific signalling pathways. However, Lhx2 appears to have different and even opposite effects in other cell types as its expression completely blocks proliferation of EryP precursor cells and to some extent also EryD precursor cells, and interferes with the initial steps of ES cell differentiation.</p><fig id="pone-0002025-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0002025.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Generation of ES cell lines with inducible gene expression.

The most obvious effects of turning Lhx2 expression on in clonal assays of EB cells generated from the iLhx2 ES cell lines, were a complete block in proliferation of EryP precursor cells and an approximate 3-fold increase in the frequency of definitive CFCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002025-g002">Fig. 2A, B</xref>). Adding dox to EB cells generated from the iLhx2-GFP ES cell line only partially blocked proliferation of EryP precursor cells and did not significantly increase the frequency of definitive CFCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002025-g002">Fig. 2A, B</xref>).

The level of Lhx2 expression increased with increasing concentrations of dox (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002025-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>), and increased expression of Lhx2 expression correlated to the level of inhibition of proliferation of EryP precursor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002025-g002">Fig. 2E</xref>), and to the synergistic effect on the frequency of definitive CFCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002025-g002">Fig. 2F</xref>).

No synergistic effect of Lhx2 expression on colony formation was observed in clonal assays when EB cells were replated in SCF and epo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002025-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>), suggesting that activation of c-kit signalling is necessary but not sufficient for the synergistic effect of Lhx2 expression on colony formation. The least complex factor combination that consistently showed a pronounced synergistic effect on colony formation when Lhx2 expression was turned on was SCF/IL-6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002025-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>). Thus, simultaneous activation of c-kit and the gp130 signal transducer is necessary and sufficient for the synergistic effect on colony formation exerted by Lhx2 expression. The definitive progenitor cells normally responding to SCF/IL-6/epo generate macrophage colonies and definitive erythroid colonies usually containing megakaryocytes and/or macrophages. Mature definitive erythrocytes assessed as hemoglobinised (red) cells rarely formed in the colonies generated in the presence of dox (data not shown), suggesting that Lhx2 expression also inhibited proliferation of the EryD precursors as was also observed for the EryP precursors cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002025-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>), whereas it appears not to interfere with differentiation into mast cells, megakaryocytes, macrophages and neutrophilic granulocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002025-Pintodo1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>.

However, since we used retroviral vectors in these experiments we have not been able to exclude the contribution of secondary genetic effects caused by the fortuitous insertion of the retroviral vector into the genome leading to inactivation of tumour suppressor genes or activation of oncogenes. By using the Ainv15 ES cell lines containing the different Lhx2 constructs we could elucidate if Lhx2 expression is necessary and sufficient for generating HSC-like cell lines and the efficiency of this event. To address these issues we analysed the efficiency of establishing HSC-like cell lines from individual colonies randomly picked from the clonal assays of EBs generated from the iLhx2 and iLhx2-GFP ES cell lines (e.g. addition of dox leads to high and intermediate levels of Lhx2 expression, respectively). The generated HSC-like cell lines were denoted dox-dependent hematopoietic progenitor cell (DoxHPC) lines (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> and ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002025-Richter1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>). The most efficient way of generating DoxHPC lines (60&#x02013;69&#x00025; of the picked colonies) was to transfer colonies from the clonal assays containing SCF/IL-6/epo/dox to liquid cultures containing SCF/IL-6/dox, performed on EBs generated from the ES cells expressing the highest level of Lhx2 (iLhx2), (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0002025-t001">Table 1</xref>). A low frequency (3&#x00025; of picked colonies) of DoxHPC lines was obtained when the same approach was applied to the EBs generated from the ES cell line expressing intermediate levels of Lhx2 (iLhx2-GFP) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0002025-t001">Table 1</xref>). No DoxHPC lines could be generated when colonies from clonal assays containing SCF/epo/dox of EBs generated from either iLhx2 or iLhx2-GFP ES cell line, were transferred to liquid cultures supplemented with SCF/dox (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0002025-t001">Table 1</xref>). The relative increase in CFCs when dox is added to the clonal assays containing SCF/IL-6/epo performed on the EB cells generated from the iLhx2 ES cells is on average 3,1-fold &#x000b1;0,5 (9 independent experiments) as compared to when dox is not added to the clonal assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002025-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). With a 3,1-fold increase in colony formation, the increase corresponds to 68&#x00025; of the total number of colony forming cells. This figure is similar to the efficiency in generating DoxHPC lines from individual colonies (60&#x02013;69&#x00025;) in equivalent experiments (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0002025-t001">Table 1</xref>), whereas the efficiency in generating DoxHPC lines from individual colonies was low or non-existing where limited or no synergistic effect was observed after dox addition to the clonal assays (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002025-g004">Figure 4A to T</xref>able 1). Thus, the efficiency in generating DoxHPC lines directly correlated to the increase in CFCs in EBs.

To start to address these issues we performed clonal assays in the presence or absence of dox on EBs generated from the iLhx2 ES cell line from day 2,5 to day 8 of differentiation. These experiments revealed that the synergistic effect of Lhx2 expression on colony formation was limited to the time points when significant numbers of definitive hematopoietic progenitor cells were detected within EBs starting at day 5 of differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002025-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>). The most pronounced synergistic effect on colony formation of Lhx2 expression was obtained at day 6 of differentiation when the highest frequency of progenitor cells normally responding this factor combination was present in EBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002025-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>). After this time point the frequency of this progenitor cell rapidly declined to be undetectable at day 8 of differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002025-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>). To analyse the effect of Lhx2 expression on the hemangioblast population that is present during early EB development, we replated day 3.25 EB cells in clonal assays supplemented with SCF and VEGF, a factor combination that promotes proliferation of blast cell colony-forming cell (CFC-Blast) leading to formation of the blast cell colony that contains cells with hemangioblast characteristics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002025-Choi1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Replating of day 3,25 EBs in this factor combination in the absence or presence of dox showed that Lhx2 expression did not have a synergistic effect, but might instead have a slight negative effect of the CFC-blast population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002025-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). To elucidate whether Lhx2 expression affects committed EryP precursors and/or commitment to this lineage from the hemangioblast we added dox to day 3 and 4 EBs, when commitment to this lineage occur, and replated the day 6 EBs without dox when commitment to this lineage has normally occurred. These experiments showed that significant but reduced numbers of EryP precursors are present in day 6 EBs compared to control EBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002025-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>). The reduced number of EryP precursors might be due to residual Lhx2 expression in the clonal assay after dox withdrawal since this precursor appear to be sensitive to Lhx2 expression and it takes at least 24 hrs to decrease expression by 90&#x02013;95&#x00025; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002025-Richter1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>. To address this issue we added dox at day 3 and withdrew it at day 5 to allow the expression level to decrease significantly before the clonal assay was performed at day 6. In this experiment the frequency of EryP precursor cells in day 6 EBs was almost equal to that of control EBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002025-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>), suggesting that Lhx2 expression blocks proliferation of precursor cells committed to the EryP lineage but does not interfere with the commitment of such precursors from the hemangioblast. These results suggested that Lhx2 expression directly affects the emerging definitive multipotential hematopoietic progenitor cell population whereas it has a limited effect on pre-hematopoietic mesoderm, limited and perhaps even a slight negative effect on the hemangioblast population.</p><fig id="pone-0002025-g005" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0002025.g005</object-id><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Analyses of the effect of Lhx2 expression at different stages of ES cell differentiation.</title><p>A.

Expression of Lhx2 in ES cells cultured in ES cell medium did not significantly affect their ability to self-renew, based on growth rate and viability (data not shown). Expression of Lhx2 during early ES cell commitment, e.g. from 2 days prior to initiation of differentiation (Day -2) and on day 0 and 1 of differentiation until day 6, suppressed EB formation whereas initiation Lhx2 expression after day 2 did not significantly affect the generation of EB cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002025-g005">Fig. 5D</xref>). Moreover, expression of Lhx2 from day 0 and 1 lead to the formation of numerous secondary EBs when day 6 EBs were replated in clonal assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002025-g005">Fig. 5E</xref>), suggesting that suppression of EB formation was most likely due to that Lhx2 expression interfered with the initial commitment step in the differentiation of ES cells. Lhx2 expression from day 0 and 1 also interfered with hematopoietic commitment as almost no hematopoietic progenitor cells were detected in day 6 EB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002025-g005">Fig. 5F</xref>), and expression from day 2 slightly affects hematopoietic commitment whereas expression from day 3 instead increase the frequency of definitive hematopoietic progenitor cells in day 6 EBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002025-g005">Fig. 5F</xref>).

These data further support that Lhx2 expression mainly interferes with the initial step in ES cell differentiation leading to the reduction of EB cells as well as hematopoietic mesoderm, whereas it does not interfere with the gastrulation process per se.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Lhx2 expression in intact EBs transiently induce expansion of definitive hematopoietic progenitor cells without exogenously added growth factors</title><p>The Lhx2-induced self-renewal of hematopoietic progenitor cells in clonal assays of EB cells was strictly dependent on specific and exogenously added growth factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002025-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). The increase in CFCs in day 6 EBs when Lhx2 was turned on at day 3 compared to control EBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002025-g005">Fig. 5F</xref>), suggested that Lhx2 expression in intact EBs support self-renewal of hematopoietic progenitor cells independently of exogenously added growth factors.

Gene expression analysis of day 6 EBs generated from the iLhx2 ES cells when Lhx2 expression was turned on at day 4 showed that genes primarily expressed by definitive hematopoietic cell populations such as <italic>GATA-2</italic> and <italic>&#x003b2;-globin</italic> (Beta major) and early neuronal ectoderm (<italic>Pax6</italic> and <italic>Otx2</italic>) were significantly upregulated compared to control EBs, whereas genes expressed by EryP cells <italic>(&#x003b2;H1</italic> or <italic>Beta H1</italic>), cardiac mesoderm (<italic>Nkx2.5</italic>, <italic>Nfatc1</italic>, <italic>Tbx1</italic>), vascular endothelium (<italic>VE-cadherin</italic>, <italic>Pecam</italic>, <italic>Flk-1</italic>), endodermal cell populations (<italic>Sox17</italic>, <italic>Foxa2</italic>, <italic>GATA4</italic>), or various stem cell populations (<italic>Oct4</italic>, <italic>Rex1</italic>, <italic>Nanog</italic>, <italic>Nestin</italic>) were not changed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002025-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>). Other early hematopoietic and/or endothelial-associated genes that Lhx2 expression did not alter were <italic>CD41</italic>, <italic>CD34</italic> and <italic>CD44</italic>. Moreover, we did not detect any increased expression of the mediators of the c-kit and gp130 signalling pathways when Lhx2 expression was turned on in day 4 EBs (e.g. <italic>SCF</italic>, <italic>c-kit</italic>, <italic>IL-6</italic>, <italic>gp130</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002025-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>). The increased expression of genes associated with definitive hematopoiesis was confirmed by that the progenitor cells responding to SCF/IL6/epo had increased 5-8-fold within the intact EB when Lhx2 was expressed during this time period compared to control EBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002025-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>). Furthermore, the synergistic effect on colony formation of Lhx2 expression was also observed in the clonal assays of the day 6 EBs when Lhx2 expression was induced from day 3 or 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002025-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>), indicating both self-renewal and differentiation of the distinct progenitor cell expanded by Lhx2 expression in EBs.

The effect of Lhx2 on hematopoietic progenitor cells is most likely due to a direct effect on the emerging definitive multipotential progenitor cells in the EBs and not due to an indirect effect by increasing hematopoietic commitment from pre-hematopoietic mesoderm, or by promoting proliferation of the hemangioblast cell population. The lack of effect of Lhx2 expression in clonal assays of day 3 and 4 EBs when the hemangioblast is the dominating progenitor cell population with hematopoietic potential, whereas expression in intact EBs from day 3 and 4 to day 6 of differentiation expand definitive hematopoietic progenitor cells, would suggest that Lhx2 expression does not induce self-renewal until the hemangioblast cell has matured into a progenitor cell harbouring only definitive hematopoietic potential.

We have previously shown that the HSC-like cell lines expressing Lhx2 self-renew by a cell nonautonomous mechanism which is in agreement with the cell nonautonomous hematopoietic phenotype in <italic>Lhx2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002025-Pintodo2">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002025-Porter1">&#x0005b;64&#x0005d;</xref>. Since Lhx2 is normally expressed in a mesenchymal cell population (hepatic stellate cells) in the fetal liver and these cells are important for the differentiation, organization and expansion of all cell types in the liver including those of the hematopoietic niche <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002025-Porter1">&#x0005b;64&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002025-Wandzioch1">&#x0005b;72&#x0005d;</xref>, it would suggest that Lhx2 regulates genes in mesenchymal cells encoding mediators involved in cell-to-cell interactions. Lhx2 expression in mesenchymal cells in addition to expression in hematopoietic cells might therefore enhance the effect on hematopoietic cells in intact EBs and the transient nature of the expansion (day 3&#x02013;5 of EB development) suggests that such interactions are only possible during early EB development. Elucidation of the molecular basis for Lhx2-induced self-renewal might therefore give insights into both cell autonomous and cell nonautonomous mechanisms regulating normal HSCs function.</p><p>Another obvious effect of Lhx2 expression on hematopoietic precursors was the complete block in proliferation of committed EryP precursor cells and to some extent also of EryD precursor cells. This observation could explain the large fluctuation in erythropoiesis <italic>in vivo</italic> seen in stem cell-deficient mice engrafted with adult HSC-like cell lines expressing Lhx2, whereas generation of myeloid cells appeared to be relatively unaffected <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002025-Pintodo3">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>. Since the level of Lhx2 expression is critical for the inhibition of erythroid development, these fluctuations could simply reflect fluctuations in the level of Lhx2 expression in erythroid precursors, and hence when Lhx2 expression is below a critical threshold the erythroid precursor can escape the inhibition. We also noticed a significantly decreased mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC) in erythrocytes originating from the HSC-like cell lines in the engrafted animals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002025-Richter2">&#x0005b;73&#x0005d;</xref>, suggesting that Lhx2 expression could interfere with globin expression. The <italic>Lhx2</italic> gene encodes a LIM-domain-containing transcription factor and transcriptional regulators containing LIM-domains (Lmo2) and LIM-domain-interacting domains (Ldb1) are known to be critically involved in erythroid differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002025-ValgeArcher1">&#x0005b;74&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002025-Visvader1">&#x0005b;76&#x0005d;</xref>. Since Lhx2 is not normally expressed in hematopoietic cells, the LIM-domain of the Lhx2 protein might physically interfere with these protein interactions and depending on the amount of Lhx2 protein in the cell cause dominant negative effects leading to the block in erythroid development and/or altered globin expression.</p><p>It has been suggested that expression of the <italic>Lhx2</italic> gene is repressed in ES cells by the Polycomb complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002025-Lee1">&#x0005b;77&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002025-Boyer1">&#x0005b;78&#x0005d;</xref>, implying that Lhx2 would promote differentiation of ES cells. However, our data reveal that Lhx2 expression does not have any obvious effects on the self-renewal of ES cells but it does interfere with the early steps in ES cell differentiation leading to reduced number of EB cells and suppression of hematopoietic mesoderm. These effects are only seen if Lhx2 is turned very early during ES cell differentiation (primarily from day 0 and 1) whereas expression after day 2 has subtle effects on the differentiation. Since our differentiation protocol is prone towards mesodermal commitment and is inefficient in promoting ectodermal and endodermal commitment, our results can be interpreted in at least two different ways. Firstly, Lhx2 interferes with conversion of primitive ectoderm to more differentiated tissues. Secondly, Lhx2 expression promotes differentiation towards a lineage that is not supported by our differentiation protocol. One of the first cell types expressing Lhx2 in the developing embryo is the neuronal ectoderm of the prospective forebrain prior to E9 (unpublished observation) and gene expression analysis of the day 6 EBs when Lhx2 was turned on at day 4 revealed a significant upregulation of the forebrain markers Pax6 and Otx2. These results suggest that Lhx2 might promote neuronal differentiation which is not supported by our differentiation protocol and neuronal commitment might be more efficient if Lhx2 is turned very early during ES cell differentiation and hence cause the reduced formation of EB cell and suppression of mesodermal commitment. Which of these alternatives that are correct are presently under investigation. Collectively these results show that the effects of Lhx2 expression have striking lineage specificity and that the level of expression is important for these effects. This work provides the first attempt to understand the wide array of functions that Lhx2 have in different organs during embryonic development such as the hematopoietic system, the liver, forebrain and neuronal retina.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Generation of ES cells with inducible gene expression</title><p>The Ainv15 ES cell line was maintained on irradiated mouse embryonic feeder (MEF) cells in Dulbecc&#x000f3;s modified Eagle medium (DMEM) (Gibco-BRL, United Kingdom) supplemented with 15&#x00025; fetal calf serum (FCS) (Boehringer, Germany), 1.5&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup> M monothioglycerol (MTG) (Sigma, Germany) and LIF (Chemicon, Ca, USA).
