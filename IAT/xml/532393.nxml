MNV-1-specific staining was observed in spleen and liver 2 d postinfection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020432-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Interestingly, in the liver, Kupffer cells (resident macrophages of the liver) lining the sinusoids were specifically stained by MNV-1 immune serum (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020432-g001">Figure 1</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020432-g001">1</xref>B).

Furthermore, in some cases virus-antigen-positive M&#x003a6; were detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020432-g001">Figure 1</xref>C).</p><p>Because cells containing viral antigen in infected mice resembled M&#x003a6;, we examined whether cells of the hematopoietic lineage such as M&#x003a6; and DCs were permissive for MNV-1 replication in vitro. Bone-marrow-derived M&#x003a6; (BMM&#x003a6;) and bone-marrow-derived DCs (BMDCs) were inoculated with a MNV-1 stock derived from the brain of infected IFN&#x003b1;&#x003b2;&#x003b3; receptor<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> (IFN&#x003b1;&#x003b2;&#x003b3;R<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>) mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020432-Karst1">Karst et al. 2003</xref>). Cytopathic effect (CPE) in cell monolayers was visible within 2 d in STAT1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> BMM&#x003a6; and BMDCs, but not STAT1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020432-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). While BMDCs showed CPE even when STAT-1 was present, wild-type (wt) BMM&#x003a6; exhibited less CPE than their STAT1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> counterparts. These data showed that MNV-1 had a marked tropism for M&#x003a6; and DCs but not fibroblasts.</p><p>We used this information to screen available M&#x003a6; cell lines for growth of MNV-1, including the murine lines RAW 264.7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020432-Raschke1">Raschke et al. 1978</xref>) and J774A.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020432-Ralph1">Ralph et al. 1975</xref>), and the human/murine hybrid line WBC264-9C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020432-Aksamit1">Aksamit 1986</xref>). These cells also showed visible CPE when inoculated with the MNV-1 stock (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020432-g002">Figure 2</xref>, data not shown). Plaques were observed when infected RAW 264.7 monolayers were maintained under agarose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020432-g002">Figure 2</xref>A), allowing us to develop a plaque assay and quantitate virus titers.</p><p>STAT1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> BMM&#x003a6;, STAT1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and wt BMDCs, and RAW 264.7 cells consistently supported the growth of MNV-1, while wt BMM&#x003a6; varied in their ability to support virus growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020432-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). BMM&#x003a6; and BMDCs cells lacking STAT-1 always yielded higher MNV-1 titers than their wt counterparts. Furthermore, a low level of virus replication was observed in STAT1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> MEFs, but as reported previously, no virus growth was observed in wt MEFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020432-Karst1">Karst et al. 2003</xref>). MNV-1 replication proceeded rapidly in permissive cells, with newly synthesized infectious virions first detected in cell lysates 9 to 12 hours postinfection (h.p.i.). Taken together, these data indicated that MNV-1 could productively infect M&#x003a6; and DCs.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Verification of Viral Growth In Vitro</title><p>Several approaches were used to verify that the observed CPE and plaques were caused by MNV-1. We first performed a clonal selection from the MNV-1 stock (from infected brain tissue) with three rounds of plaque purification in RAW 264.7 cells to generate the MNV-1.CW1 strain. This strain was amplified in RAW 264.7 cells, after which virus particles were concentrated and subjected to purification by isopycnic centrifugation in CsCl. A distinct band was observed in CsCl gradients at a density of 1.35 &#x000b1; 0.01 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, consistent with that described for noroviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020432-Kapikian1">Kapikian et al. 1996</xref>). Examination of the material in this fraction by negative staining electron microscopy showed the presence of virus particles with calicivirus morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020432-g003">Figure 3</xref>A). Furthermore, SDS-PAGE analysis of this material revealed a major protein of approximately 59 kDa, consistent with the calculated mass of the MNV-1 capsid protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020432-g003">Figure 3</xref>B,C). Western blot analysis with antibodies generated against bacterially expressed MNV-1 capsid protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020432-g003">Figure 3</xref>B) and mass spectrometry (data not shown) confirmed its identity as the MNV-1 capsid protein. A genomic-sized RNA molecule of approximately 7.4 kb was detected in nucleic acid isolated from the purified virions with a probe specific for the MNV-1 genome in Northern blots (data not shown). Finally, a neutralization assay was performed with the monoclonal antibody (mAb) A6.2 specific for the MNV-1 capsid protein (see Materials and Methods). MAb A6.2 specifically bound to CsCl-purified MNV-1 virions in an immunoassay, while the isotype-matched mAb 10H2, an anti-reovirus &#x003bc;1c mAb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020432-Virgin1">Virgin et al. 1991</xref>), did not bind (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020432-g003">Figure 3</xref>D). MAb A6.2, but not the isotype control antibody 10H2, showed neutralization activity in a plaque reduction assay for both the virus in the original brain homogenate (MNV-1), and the three-times plaque-purified strain MNV-1.CW1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020432-g003">Figure 3</xref>E). Together these data confirmed that MNV-1 was the infectious agent associated with viral growth observed in the infected cell cultures.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>MNV-1 RNA and Protein Production in Permissive Cells</title><p>To compare MNV-1 replication in cells with that of other caliciviruses, we analyzed viral RNA and protein synthesis in MNV-1.CW1-infected RAW 264.7 cells. Northern blot analysis using a probe specific for the positive strand of the MNV-1 genome showed an increase in the accumulation of full-length (7.4 kb) and subgenomic-length (2.3 kb) MNV-1 genome over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020432-g003">Figure 3</xref>F). Radiolabeled MNV-1-infected RAW 264.7 cell lysates were analyzed by immunoprecipitation with serum from a MNV-1 infected mouse, and a 59-kDa protein consistent with the capsid protein was detected as early as 6 h.p.i. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020432-g003">Figure 3</xref>G). Additional proteins accumulated over time that corresponded in size to expected calicivirus nonstructural proteins such as the 76-kDa proteinase-polymerase precursor and an approximately 40-kDa NTPase protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020432-Sosnovtsev1">Sosnovtsev et al. 2002</xref>). These data showed that the viral RNA and proteins synthesized in infected cells were consistent with calicivirus replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020432-Green1">Green et al. 2001</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Ultrastructural Examination of MNV-1-Infected RAW 264.7 Cells</title><p>Positive-strand RNA viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020432-Dales1">Dales et al. 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020432-Mackenzie1">Mackenzie et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020432-Pedersen1">Pedersen et al. 1999</xref>), including caliciviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020432-Love1">Love et al. 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020432-Studdert1">Studdert and O'Shea 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020432-Green2">Green et al. 2002</xref>), are known to replicate in association with intracellular membranes. Therefore, we examined the ultrastructural morphology of MNV-1.CW1-infected RAW 264.7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020432-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Over time, virus-infected cells showed a striking change in overall morphology and intracellular organization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020432-g004">Figure 4</xref>D&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020432-g004">4</xref>L) compared to mock-infected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020432-g004">Figure 4</xref>A&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020432-g004">4</xref>C). Structures resembling virus particles were observed within or next to single- or double-membraned vesicles in the cytoplasm by 12 h.p.i. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020432-g004">Figure 4</xref>D). The vesiculated areas increased in size with time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020432-g004">Figure 4</xref>G&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020432-g004">4</xref>I), and by 24 h.p.i., large numbers of these vesicles and viral particles occupied most of the cytoplasm, displacing the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020432-g004">Figure 4</xref>J&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020432-g004">4</xref>L). In addition, a complete rearrangement of intracellular membranes with some confronting membranes occurred (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020432-g004">Figure 4</xref>J), leading to a rearrangement of the endoplasmic reticulum and loss of an intact Golgi apparatus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020432-g004">Figure 4</xref>E; data not shown). Interestingly, these smooth-membraned vesicles were often surrounded by mitochondria. A small proportion of cells also showed crystalline arrays of cytoplasmic virus particles (data not shown). These observations indicate that like other positive-strand RNA viruses, norovirus RNA replication likely occurs in association with intracellular membranes.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Characterization of the Plaque-Purified Strain MNV-1.CW1 In Vitro</title><p>To determine whether the plaque purification and sequential amplification of MNV-1 in RAW 264.7 cells had altered its growth characteristics, different cell types were infected with passage (P) 3 of MNV-1.CW1. In general, the growth of MNV-1.CW1 (P3) in wt or STAT1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> M&#x003a6; and MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020432-g005">Figure 5</xref>A) as well as RAW 264.7 cells (data not shown) was similar to that observed for the original parental MNV-1 virus stock (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020432-g002">Figure 2</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020432-g005">5</xref>A). Virus titers were reproducibly higher in STAT1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells compared to wt cells, and MNV-1.CW1 (P3) growth was consistently observed in wt BMM&#x003a6;. These data demonstrated that our plaque purification and serial passage in RAW 264.7 cells had not changed the tropism of the virus for primary DCs and M&#x003a6; and confirmed the importance of STAT-1 in controlling MNV-1 growth at the cellular level.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Cellular Factors Controlling MNV-1 Growth In Vitro</title><p>Previous studies demonstrated that a lack of STAT-1 or both IFN&#x003b1;&#x003b2;R and IFN&#x003b3;R increase susceptability to MNV-1 infection. Mice lacking individual IFNR, inducible nitric oxide (iNOS)<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>, or protein kinase R (PKR)<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> are not susceptible (Karst at al. 2003). Therefore, we determined whether molecules other than STAT-1 exhibited antiviral effects at the level of the infected cell. Primary BMM&#x003a6; from wt mice or mouse strains deficient in STAT-1, IFN&#x003b1;&#x003b2;R, IFN&#x003b3;R, IFN&#x003b1;&#x003b2;&#x003b3;R, iNOS, or PKR were directly compared for their ability to support virus replication at two different multiplicities of infection (MOIs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020432-g005">Figure 5</xref>B). Again, BMM&#x003a6; cells from both wt and STAT1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice supported MNV-1 virus replication, with higher titers observed in cells deficient in STAT-1. Cells obtained from mice lacking both Type I and II IFNR (IFN&#x003b1;&#x003b2;&#x003b3;R<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>) or Type I IFNR alone (IFN&#x003b1;&#x003b2;R<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>) supported replication of virus as efficiently as STAT1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells. In addition, wt BMM&#x003a6; and wt BMDCs secrete IFN&#x003b1; after MNV-1-infection, as determined by IFN&#x003b1; enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (data not shown). This is consistent with a direct role for IFN signaling in MNV-1 growth but does not rule out the possibility that effects of STAT-1 and IFN&#x003b1;&#x003b2;R occur in vivo prior to explantation of the bone marrow. Absence of IFN&#x003b3;R, iNOS, or PKR did not have a statistically significant effect on MNV-1 growth in BMM&#x003a6;. Together, these data demonstrate that the antiviral molecules STAT-1 and IFN&#x003b1;&#x003b2; are part of a cellular response that limits norovirus growth.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Characterization of the Plaque-Purified Strain MNV-1.CW1 In Vivo</title><p>To address the effects of cell culture adaptation on virulence, STAT1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice were infected orally with MNV-1.CW1 from three successive passages (P1, P2, and P3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020432-g006">Figure 6</xref>A).

Three nucleotide changes occurred between the parental virus and P1, with one of these resulting in an amino acid substitution (histidine to arginine) at residue 845, located within the predicted &#x0201c;3A-like&#x0201d; region of the nonstructural polyprotein. In the P2 virus, which retained virulence but at a reduced level compared to the parental and P1 viruses, a second nucleotide substitution within the predicted &#x0201c;3A-like&#x0201d; coding region was observed that caused an amino acid change (valine to isoleucine) at residue 716. The partial attenuation of virulence of the P2 virus in vivo is of interest since the homologous protein in poliovirus, the 3A protein, alters the amount of cytokines secreted from cells, with likely effects on viral pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020432-Dodd1">Dodd et al. 2001</xref>). Of note, a mixed population of A and G nucleotides was detected at position 5,941 of the P2 viral genome that could potentially yield two populations of virus with either amino acid lysine or glutamic acid at residue 296 of the capsid protein. In the P3 virus, which was avirulent in mice, the G nucleotide sequence at position 5,941 emerged as the predominant sequence. The resulting amino acid substitution was of interest because of its location within the hypervariable P2 domain, which contains the putative receptor-binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020432-Prasad1">Prasad et al. 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020432-Prasad2">1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020432-White1">White et al. 1996</xref>). However, altered virus binding to permissive cells cannot explain the attenuated phenotype since the parental virus and MNV-1.CW1 (P3) replicate to similar levels in BMDCs and BMM&#x003a6; in vitro. Similar to our findings, the P2 domain was also implicated in attenuation of porcine enteric calicivirus virulence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020432-Guo1">Guo et al. 2001</xref>). This study suggests that the norovirus capsid protein, especially the hypervariable P2 domain, and possibly the 3A-like protein, may be important sites for the development of virulence-attenuating mutations.</p></sec><sec id="s2i"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Detection of MNV-1-positive cells of the M&#x003a6; and DC lineage in infected organs of STAT1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice led to our finding that MNV-1 grows in these cell types in vitro. This provides the first tissue culture model for a norovirus. In addition, the antiviral Type I IFN response with signaling through STAT-1 is crucial for resistance to murine norovirus infection in vivo and in vitro. Taken together the previous in vivo data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020432-Karst1">Karst et al. 2003</xref>) and the tropism of this norovirus for cells of the innate immune system, underscore the importance of the innate immune response, specifically STAT-1 and Type I IFNs, in resistance against norovirus infection. These data may aid the development of a culture system for human noroviruses since neither cells of the M&#x003a6;/DC lineage nor cells with defects in the Type I IFN/STAT-1 antiviral pathway have likely been investigated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020432-Duizer1">Duizer et al. 2004</xref>). Furthermore, this MNV-1 tissue culture model will help elucidate stages of the viral life cycle and cellular factors essential for norovirus replication that may provide targets for prevention or control of an important human disease.</p><p>The demonstration of a tropism of MNV-1 for DCs was unexpected, as a calicivirus tropism for DCs has not been previously described. However, like MNV-1, other caliciviruses do interact with M&#x003a6;. Viral RNA from rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus, a lagovirus, was detected in splenic and alveolar M&#x003a6; by in situ hybridization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020432-Kimura1">Kimura et al. 2001</xref>). In addition, feline calicivirus, a vesivirus, showed a small, transient increase in viral titers in alveolar M&#x003a6; cultures, indicative of abortive infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020432-Langloss1">Langloss et al. 1978</xref>). It is possible that M&#x003a6; contribute to the spread of the virus through the host, but it must be noted that M&#x003a6; supported MNV-1 growth to a lower extent than DCs unless they lacked specific immune defense molecules such as STAT-1. This argues that M&#x003a6; may be the cell through which STAT1-dependent innate immunity limits MNV-1 virulence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020432-Karst1">Karst et al. 2003</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to M&#x003a6;, DCs were permissive even when STAT-1 was present (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020432-g002">Figure 2</xref>). DCs are sentinels of the immune system whose function is to acquire antigens and stimulate lymphocytes. Intestinal DCs are found in the gut in specialized lymphoid tissues where they can sample enteric antigens by extending their dendrites into the gut lumen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020432-Stagg1">Stagg et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020432-Kraehenbuhl1">Kraehenbuhl and Corbett 2004</xref>). We therefore speculate that DCs in humans and mice provide noroviruses access to subepithelial regions of the intestine, thereby contributing to norovirus disease pathogenesis. Further studies are in progress to address the role of M&#x003a6; and DCs in the intestine and the physiologic relevance of these cells for MNV-1 pathogenesis in general.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s3"><title>Material and Methods</title><sec id="s3a"><title/><sec id="s3a1"><title>Cell cultures and mice</title><p>MEFs were generated and cultured as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020432-Pollock1">Pollock et al. 1997</xref>).
