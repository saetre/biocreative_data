Head-to-head docked connexons provide low-resistance cell-to-cell channels between adjoining cells, clusters of which are called gap junctions. It is through gap junction channels that cells share ions, second messengers and small metabolites of up to 1 kDa in molecular mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh792c1">1</xref>). If gap-junctional communication is compromised, normal tissue function cannot be maintained and disease may ensue. Mutations in genes that encode gap-junctional proteins leading to abnormal patterns of connexin expression often correlate with diseases, such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMTX) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh792c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh792c3">3</xref>), deafness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh792c4">4</xref>), heart failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh792c5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh792c8">8</xref>) and cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh792c9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh792c12">12</xref>). Cx43 is expressed in multiple tissues including epithelium, myocardium, myometrium and other smooth muscles. Its relative abundance varies from tissue to tissue. The regulation of its expression in response to external stimuli or during development appears to be cell-type-specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh792c13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh792c17">17</xref>). This suggests that complex mechanisms may be involved in the regulation of the <italic>cx43</italic> gene.</p><p>Fishman <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh792c18">18</xref>) and Fromaget <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh792c19">19</xref>) showed that the levels of cx43 mRNA and protein concentrations increased 8&#x02013;15-fold in the rat and mouse developing heart between the early fetal period and 6 weeks after birth. Maximum cx43 mRNA levels are reached 1 week after birth while the peak in cx43 protein does not occur until the third week of life. This temporal difference in the accumulation of mRNA and protein suggests that at early stages of heart development the levels of expression of cx43 protein are regulated at the post-stranscriptional level. In addition to the temporal differences, there are also regional differences. Immunohistochemistry and <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization in rodent fetal heart showed high expression of cx43 mRNA but no detectable protein in the subepicardial layer of the ventricular free wall. In contrast, a relatively faint signal corresponding to cx43 mRNA and a relative abundant expression of cx43 protein are observed in the myocardium of the atria and the ventricular trabeculations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh792c18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh792c21">21</xref>). Adult heart is also an example of regional regulation of cx43 expression. In the ventricle, cx43 protein is abundant in the trabeculae and weak in the epicardial myocardium, despite similar mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh792c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh792c23">23</xref>).</p><p>Another example of the complex regulation of the <italic>cx43</italic> gene is found in the ovary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh792c24">24</xref>). In the primordial follicle cx43 expression is restricted to the cumulus&#x0002f;granulosa cells, and no cx43 is expressed in the prophase-arrested oocyte. Maturation of the follicle involves a series of events that require varying levels of cx43 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh792c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh792c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh792c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh792c24">24</xref>). During estrous cycle, the regulation of cx43 expression is dependent on the levels of gonadotropins. Exposure of granulosa cells to follicle stimulating hormone results in the upregulation of cx43 mRNA and protein. In contrast, luteinizing hormone (LH) elicits an inhibitory effect on cx43 synthesis in large preovulatory follicles. A decrease but not complete disappearance in cx43 mRNA is seen after long exposure to LH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh792c13">13</xref>). Altogether, these studies suggest that the <italic>cx43</italic> gene in the ovary is also regulated by cell-type-dependent transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms.</p><p>The structure of the connexin genes was initially thought to be conserved for all members of this family. It was described as consisting of two exons interrupted by a single intron of variable size. The intron was found to be 10.5 kb for the murine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh792c25">25</xref>) and 8.6 kb for the rat <italic>cx43</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh792c15">15</xref>) as characterized by restriction digestion mapping and sequencing of clones isolated from genomic libraries. In this structure, exon1 encodes most of the 5&#x02032;-untranslated region (5&#x02032;-UTR) while exon2 contains only 13 bases of the 5&#x02032;-UTR followed by the complete coding sequence and its 3&#x02032;-UTR. Recently, a few exceptions to this common structure have been found in some connexin genes. The exceptions have been classified into two groups, one involving alternative splicing of 5&#x02032;-UTRs, and the other splicing of the connexin coding region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh792c26">26</xref>). Examples of the first group include the mammalian <italic>cx32</italic> gene which consists of four exons, three of them representing alternative 5&#x02032;-UTRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh792c27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh792c29">29</xref>); the murine <italic>cx45</italic> gene consisting of three exons, two of them consecutively spliced to form its 5&#x02032;-UTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh792c30">30</xref>); the <italic>cx30</italic> gene with three exons either alternatively or consecutively spliced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh792c26">26</xref>); and the human <italic>cx40</italic> gene with three exons two of them alternatively spliced to form two alternative 5&#x02032;-UTRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh792c31">31</xref>). The second group includes the connexins hCx31.3, mCx36, hCx36 and mCx57 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh792c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh792c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh792c33">33</xref>), but most of their gene structures have not been fully described.</p><p>Even though enough evidence exists to suggest the existence of regulation of translation of the connexin genes, not much is known about the mechanisms involved. Alternate 5&#x02032;-UTRs are highly suggestive of translational control. In fact, a single point mutation in the nerve-specific 5&#x02032;-UTR of the cx32 mRNA prevents its translation in patients with CMTX disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh792c34">34</xref>). In addition, internal ribosomal entry sites (IRESs) have been found in the 5&#x02032;-UTRs of the <italic>cx32</italic> and the <italic>cx43</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh792c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh792c35">35</xref>), which have been proposed to function in maintaining connexin expression at times when cap-mediated translation is shut off (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh792c36">36</xref>). This together with our interest to understand the mechanisms of regulation of the <italic>cx43</italic> gene prompted us to further investigate whether additional 5&#x02032;-UTR sequences of the <italic>cx43</italic> gene may exist. If such alternative 5&#x02032;-UTRs exist, any investigation on <italic>connexin43</italic> gene regulation would have to take them into account. As a first step, we searched the expressed sequence tags (ESTs) database for sequences coding for cx43 but varying at their 5&#x02032; ends. This initial search led us to discover eight previously unknown 5&#x02032; UTRs in mouse cx43 mRNA, which appear to exhibit different translational efficiencies. Furthermore, two additional cell-type-specific promoters were identified which are likely to be used to differentially regulate transcription of the <italic>cx43</italic> gene. From this work, a complex gene structure emerges for <italic>cx43</italic> which suggests a rather intricate regulation of cx43 expression.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Database search and secondary structure prediction</title><p>GenBank vertebrate EST databases and rodent genomes were searched for cx43 sequences with the basic local alignment search tool (BLAST) developed by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh792c37">37</xref>).

In this system only full-length, capped mRNA is reverse transcribed. To assure this, triple oligo(dT) selected, DNA-free, RNA template is treated with calf intestinal phosphatase (CIP) to remove 5&#x02032;-phosphates from rRNA, tRNA and fragmented mRNA. The cap structure is then removed by treatment with the Tobacco Acid Pyrophosphatase (TAP) to ligate a synthetic RNA adapter oligonucleotide to the mRNA 5&#x02032; end with T4 RNA ligase. A random-primed reverse transcription reaction is then carried out to make a cDNA copy of the treated RNA. Finally, the cDNA is RNase treated and size selected by column chromatography.

However, restriction digestion and sequencing data on genomic clones had assigned a size of 10.5 kb to the mouse intron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh792c21">21</xref>). This discrepancy of 20 kb could be due to an error in the assembly of chromosome 10 sequence or to DNA rearrangements that occurred during the generation or propagation of the genomic library.</p><p>A BLAST alignment of the cx43 cDNA sequence against the murine EST database revealed a long list of sequences that perfectly matched exon2 but differed upstream from it. All these sequences mapped to a region of chromosome 10 upstream of exon2 and they all contained consensus splice junctions at their 3&#x02032; ends. Based on this information, it appeared possible that multiple mRNA species with different 5&#x02032;-UTRs are generated from the <italic>cx43</italic> gene. To confirm the existence of these predicted transcripts, total RNA from a variety of tissues expressing cx43 was analyzed using RT&#x02013;PCR. As antisense primer a sequence complementary to the coding region was used, and various forward primers were designed according to the putative 5&#x02032;-UTRs derived from the EST analysis (for details see Materials and Methods). All the predicted exons were found in mRNA obtained from six different tissues (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh792f1">1</xref>A). It appeared that the relative abundance of some of the mRNA species varied according to the source of RNA and, therefore, must constitute a tissue-specific feature. It should be noted that the RT&#x02013;PCR products representing UTR 1B<sub>L</sub> and UTR 1B<sub>S</sub>-1D run at the same position in the gel shown and thus needed to be identified by subcloning. Sequence analysis of the PCR products confirmed that each of the new exons, previously described as part of the cx43 intron, was directly linked to exon2 (coding sequence). The complete redefined exon&#x02013;intron structure of the <italic>cx43</italic> gene is shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh792f1">1</xref>B. It contains six exons, five of which code for different 5&#x02032;-UTRs, and one for the coding region. Some of the transcripts contain combinations of two exons, others three exons (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh792f1">1</xref>C). In addition, there seems to be variation in the size of some of the exons.</p><p>To investigate whether the complex structure of the <italic>cx43</italic> gene applied only to the murine gene or whether this was a general feature of the <italic>cx43</italic> gene that is conserved across species, a BLAST search of the human and other eukaryotes EST databases was carried out using either the rat or the human cDNA sequence as the query. The search did not yield any hit in the human database other than the known 5&#x02032;-UTR (GenBank accession no. NM000165). The rat EST database contained a single alternative 5&#x02032;-UTR related to the mouse exon1C sequence (GenBank accession no. CB613999). The human and rat EST databases are much smaller and therefore less complete than the mouse EST database. Thus, the lack of hits does not rule out the existence of alternative 5&#x02032;-UTRs.</p><p>RT&#x02013;PCR on different rat tissues (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh792f2">2</xref>A) indicates that four of the six exons found in mouse are also present in rat. The primers for RT&#x02013;PCR analysis were chosen by their sequence identity to the recently identified murine 5&#x02032;-UTRs and by their relative position to exon2. No equivalents of the mouse exons 1D or 1E were found. However, novel mRNA species containing both a shorter and a longer version of the exon1C, not found in mouse, were present in rat. This shows that the <italic>cx43</italic> gene in other species is transcribed into multiple mRNA species as well (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh792f2">2</xref>B). A new structure of the rat <italic>cx43</italic> gene is depicted in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh792f2">2</xref>C. No RT&#x02013;PCR was performed on human mRNA.</p></sec><sec><title>Cell-type-dependent promoter usage and alternative splicing generates a series of cx43 transcripts</title><p>Some of the newly identified exons, especially those that are located within the previously described large intron, are likely to be generated from different promoters. To determine the transcription start sites of these mRNA species, cDNA constructed from capped full-length oligo(dT)-purified mRNA from 10&#x02013;12&#x02013;day-old mouse embryos (Ambion) was subjected to 5&#x02032;-RLM-RACE analysis. The positions of the reverse primers used in this experiment are indicated in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh792f3">3</xref>A. Sequencing of the obtained PCR products revealed that there are several transcription start sites for exon 1A corresponding to cytosines at positions &#x02212;58, &#x02212;13 and &#x0002b;1. The start site for exon1B is an adenine at position &#x0002b;215, and for exon1C a thymine at position &#x0002b;1793. The nucleotide positions were numbered with respect to the previously described start site (&#x0002b;1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh792c25">25</xref>). No primer was used for exon1D since this exon always appeared linked to either exon1B or exon1C. The two start sites found for transcription of exon1A<sub>S</sub> probably are controlled by the previously known cx43 promoter, which we now call P1. However, there must be two additional promoters downstream of P1: promoter P2 located within exon1A and promoter P3 located in the intron just upstream of exon1C. The P2 sequence had been previously proposed by Carystinos <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh792c40">40</xref>) to function as an additional promoter of the <italic>cx43</italic> gene.</p><p>To test whether the P2 and P3 sequences could in fact function as promoters, we subcloned &#x0223c;200 bp of the rat genomic sequence immediately upstream of either exon1B or exon1C into the MCS of the pGL2-Basic luciferase reporter plasmid (Promega). When transfected into CHO cells both P2 and P3<sub>(0.2)</sub> constructs induced luciferase activities 8- and 3-fold, respectively, as compared to the empty vector (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh792f3">3</xref>B). Inclusion of an additional 800 bp of upstream sequence (P3 construct in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh792f3">3</xref>B) increased the activity to 13-fold, which is still below the levels provided by the previously described P1 promoter (28-fold). Insertion of inverted sequences for P2 and P3 (P2<sub>rev</sub> and P3<sub>rev</sub> constructs) failed to activate the luciferase gene. This demonstrates that P2 and P3, indeed, can function as promoters. Relative promoter strength was always P1 &#x0003e; P3 &#x0003e; P2 in all cell lines tested, which included HeLa and HC-11 (data not shown).</p><p>To study whether promoter P3 is used more prominently in certain cell types, the relative abundance of the exon1C transcript was determined in seven different tissues known to express cx43. Screened tissues included heart, uterus, ovary, brain, mammary gland, lung and liver. Semiquantitative RT&#x02013;PCR analysis suggested that among the tissues analyzed promoter P3 was most active in the ovary (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh792f3">3</xref>C). Nevertheless, RNA protection analysis showed that the percentage of transcripts produced from P3 represented only 8.5% of the total cx43 mRNA in this tissue (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh792f3">3</xref>D). This correlates well with the <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription studies which classified P1 as a more active promoter than P3 in all cell lines tested (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh792f3">3</xref>B and data not shown). It is possible that P3 activity is regulated in response to unknown signals. Furthermore, P3 activity may be limited to specific cell types within a tissue. Thus, it may be diluted by the more commonly used P1 promoter when whole tissue is analyzed. To test whether this is the case, we decided to analyze different parts of the heart which are known to contain different cell types. We chose heart because regional differences in the regulation of cx43 expression had been shown to involve both transcriptional and post-transcriptional mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh792c23">23</xref>) and also because dissection of its different parts is relatively easy. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh792f3">3</xref>E, promoter P2 seems to be active in atria and septum but not in the ventricle tip. In contrast, P3 functions only in ventricle but not in the atrium or the septum. Promoter P1 is active throughout the organ. Alternative splicing or exon choice also seems to be cell-type-specific since transcripts containing exon1B preferentially skip exon1D in the septum whereas in the atrium exon1D is included in about half of the transcripts. Inclusion of exon1E occurs preferentially in atrium and to some extent in the septum, but not at all in the ventricle.</p></sec><sec><title>Translation of cx43 is regulated by its alternative 5&#x02032;-UTRs</title><p>What is the function of these alternatively spliced 5&#x02032;-UTRs? It is possible that they provide a mechanism to regulate expression of cx43 post-transcriptionally either by increasing or decreasing the translational efficiency of the mRNA. To further investigate this possibility, each of the nine different 5&#x02032;-UTRs was cloned immediately upstream of the luciferase coding region in the CMV promoter driven pcDNA3.1 plasmid (Invitrogen). Analysis of various cell lines transiently transfected with these constructs shows that all versions of exon1A 5&#x02032;-UTRs are equally efficient in the production of protein with the exception of the exon1A&#x02013;1E combination which completely blocks luciferase expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh792f4">4</xref>A). Translation of mRNA-containing exon1B as 5&#x02032;-UTR was less efficient, and mRNA-containing exon1C was almost inactive. Only CHO cells showed some activity with exon1C-containing mRNA. Our results also show that mRNA containing the exon1B<sub>S</sub>&#x02013;1D combination has a much lower translational activity than mRNA containing only exon1B<sub>L</sub> 5&#x02032;-UTR, even though exon1B<sub>L</sub> and the exon1B<sub>S</sub>&#x02013;1D combination have a similar length, indicating that it is the 3&#x02032; moiety of the leader sequence that plays a role in the regulation of translation. The same pattern of differential activity was observed when cells were transfected with <italic>in vitro</italic> transcribed mRNA containing the various 5&#x02032;-UTRs linked to the luciferase coding region (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh792f4">4</xref>B). DNA transfection allows effects on the generation and processing of transcripts while mRNA transfection eliminates these possibilities. Thus, this result confirms that the novel 5&#x02032;-UTRs indeed play a role in regulating cx43 synthesis at the post-transcriptional level. Furthermore, the different activities linked to these alternative 5&#x02032;-UTRs do not appear to be a consequence of differential mRNA stability as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh792f4">4</xref>C by semiquantitative RT&#x02013;PCR. Varying the levels of total RNA used as template and reducing the number of cycles of PCR amplification did not alter the results (data not shown). Therefore, the observed differences in luciferase activities must be mainly due to differences in translation efficiencies.</p></sec><sec><title>Inclusion of exon1E inhibits the translation of the cx43 transcript by introducing an additional AUG in the leader sequence</title><p>As mentioned above, inclusion of exon1E in the cx43 5&#x02032;-UTR dramatically down regulates translation. This inhibitory effect could be mediated by an out-of-frame AUG triplet, located 26 nt upstream of the start codon, which is introduced into the mRNA when exon1E is included. To test whether the upstream AUG (uAUG) is responsible for this inhibitory effect, we mutated the T in the triplet to an A (1A-1EmATG). As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh792f5">5</xref>A, mutation of this AUG significantly reversed the inhibitory effect suggesting that, at least in part, the mechanism used by the cell to downregulate translation requires this uAUG. The same effect is seen when <italic>in vitro</italic> transcribed mutant 1A-1E mRNA is used for transfection (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh792f5">5</xref>B). We also noted that the secondary structure of exon1A, as determined by the mFOLD program, drastically changes when exon1E is included (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh792f5">5</xref>C). This profound change in the secondary structure of the leader sequence is accompanied by a decrease in its free energy indicative of a much more stable structure. This together with the additional AUG triplet may explain the strong inhibitory effect exon1E has on translation. Mutation of the uAUG triplet does not alter the secondary structure of the exon1A-1E 5&#x02032;-UTR (data not shown). Since this mechanism could be utilized by the cell to downregulate production of cx43, it was of interest to find out what type of cells may be using it. For this purpose semiquantitative RT&#x02013;PCR was performed on RNA from seven different tissues (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh792f5">5</xref>D). Again, ovary seemed to contain the highest expression levels of exon1E with respect to the other tissues analyzed. To more precisely quantify the percentage of transcripts containing exon1E in this tissue, ovarian RNA was subjected to RPA analysis. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh792f5">5</xref>E shows that exon1E is included only in 10% of the total cx43 message in ovary.</p></sec><sec><title>Addition of extra 5&#x02032;-UTR sequence reduces exon1A IRES activity</title><p>It had been previously shown in our laboratory that the cx43 exon1A contains IRES activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh792c35">35</xref>). Because translation efficiency was drastically reduced by the inclusion of exon1E in the transcript, we wanted to know whether it affected IRES activity. To test for IRES activity, a series of bicistronic constructs were made. They contained exon1A either with or without exon1E, or exon1A<sub>L</sub> directly upstream of the Firefly-luciferase coding sequence. In these bicistronic constructs, a <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase gene is located upstream from the Firefly luciferase gene, separated by a prominent stem&#x02013;loop to prevent ribosome scanning, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh792c35">35</xref>). As indicated by the levels of relative Firefly&#x0002f;<italic>Renilla</italic> activities, inclusion of the exon1E sequence completely inhibited the IRES activity of exon1A (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh792f6">6</xref>A). As mentioned earlier, the secondary structure of the exon1A 5&#x02032;-UTR not only changes quite drastically with the inclusion of exon1E but also becomes much more stable (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh792f5">5</xref>C).</p><p>Addition of the exon1A<sub>S</sub> sequence to exon1A significantly reduced its IRES activity (3-fold) both in CHO (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh792f6">6</xref>A) and HC-11 cells (data not shown). This result was surprising since exon1A<sub>L</sub>-containing monocistronic capped transcripts were translated with a similar efficiency (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh792f5">5</xref>A and B). Still more surprising was the finding that the inclusion of the exon1A<sub>S</sub> neither altered the structure nor affected the stability of the secondary structure of the exon1A-containing 5&#x02032;-UTR (cf. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh792f6">6</xref>B with Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh792f5">5</xref>C). However, it was noticed that even though the general secondary structure did not change much, the region next to the start codon folded into an extra stem&#x02013;loop, which could be responsible for less efficient ribosome recruitment. To test this hypothesis, the same transfection experiment was carried out in the presence of an antisense DNA complementary to nucleotides 5&#x02013;27 nt from the 5&#x02032; end (oligoA<sub>S</sub>) in the 1A<sub>L</sub> 5&#x02032;-UTR. If our model is correct and the accessibility of the AUG plays a role in the IRES activity, oligoA<sub>S</sub> should destabilize this extra stem&#x02013;loop and therefore should recover exon1A IRES activity. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh792f6">6</xref>C, the presence of oligoA<sub>S</sub> not only recovered but even surpassed the levels of IRES activity of exon1A indicating that the accessibility of the region just upstream of the start codon is indeed required for exon1A-mediated IRES activity. As a negative control, oligoA<sub>S</sub> had no effect on IRES-mediated translation of the regular exon1A mRNA which lacks this sequence.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><sec><title>Cx43 transcription starts from three different promoters</title><p>This work establishes a new more complex structure of the <italic>cx43</italic> gene, which includes three alternate promoters and six different exons and highlights the intricate regulation of the <italic>cx43</italic> gene at multiple levels: transcription, pre-mRNA splicing and translation. Our first hint of the existence of new promoters (P2 and P3) came from the mapping of the transcription start sites of the newly identified exons 1B and 1C. The P2 sequence had been shown to be involved in protein binding through footprinting studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh792c41">41</xref>). It had also been proposed as a putative promoter mediating upregulation of cx43 expression through the Ras signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh792c40">40</xref>), which is known to converge with the cAMP response pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh792c42">42</xref>). Interestingly enough, a screen of the P2 and P3 promoters for consensus transcription factor binding using the TFSearch program at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bioinformatics.vg/">http://www.bioinformatics.vg/</ext-link> yielded cAMP response elements only in P2. In contrast, Sp1 and STAT factor binding sites were found in P3 but not in P2 suggesting that promoters P2 and P3 are regulated differently.</p><p>Because P1 is the most prominent promoter in all cell types tested and tissues analyzed, we cannot answer why the <italic>cx43</italic> gene requires three alternative promoters. It is possible that the activities of the new promoters are needed by the cell for specific situations or used in a specific spatio-temporal manner, i.e. during processes such as cell differentiation and&#x0002f;or embryonic development. Alternatively they may be preferentially used in very scarce cell types, the activities of which would be diluted by the more commonly used P1 promoter when the whole tissue is analyzed. This latter possibility is supported by the regional differences observed in the heart. <italic>In situ</italic> hybridization studies using probes designed to anneal specifically either to exon1B or exon1C could help to narrow down the specific cell type(s) where P2 or P3 activities may be prominent. Thus, future studies on the mechanisms that regulate the transcription of the <italic>cx43</italic> gene should include the new promoters P2 and P3. Our incomplete knowledge of <italic>cx43</italic> gene regulation at the transcriptional level may be due to the fact that so far only P1 has been investigated.</p></sec><sec><title>Novel 5&#x02032;-UTRs may regulate cx43 expression</title><p>In addition to transcription from three different promoters, alternative splicing provides a further level of complexity to modulate expression of cx43. The diversity found at the 5&#x02032; ends of cx43 mRNAs is likely to have an important effect on the translation of the mRNA and could possibly explain the reported discrepancies between steady-state mRNA levels and protein expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh792c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh792c17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh792c23">23</xref>). In fact, even though the exon1A transcript seems to be the most abundant species in all tissues analyzed so far, we have shown that in ovary exon1A-1E and exon1C transcripts constitute &#x0223c;18.5% of the total cx43 mRNA, which is not a negligible amount. This amount may be even larger in certain ovarian cell types or in response to certain stimuli. In support of this argument, Kalma <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh792c43">43</xref>) have recently shown that LH inhibits cx43 expression by reducing its rate of translation in the ovarian follicle. Our experiments show that these new 5&#x02032;-UTR sequences lead to very different protein yields in various cell types (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh792f4">4</xref>A&#x02013;C) indicating that they contain <italic>cis</italic>-RNA elements that respond to specific factors to modulate the translational efficiency of the transcript.</p><p>Effects on mRNA stability are unlikely because transfections with DNA constructs produced the same outcome as transfections with exogenously transcribed mRNA (cf. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh792f4">4</xref>A and B). Also, semiquantitative RT&#x02013;PCR analysis indicated that mRNA levels remained constant throughout our experiments (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh792f4">4</xref>C). However, we cannot rule out the possibility that <italic>in vivo</italic> these newly identified 5&#x02032;-UTRs act in combination with other sequences within the coding region or within the 3&#x02032;-UTR to regulate mRNA turnover. Furthermore, they could influence the subcellular localization of the transcript which may be important for the final cx43 expression profile.</p></sec><sec><title>Exon1E inhibits cx43 translation</title><p>The inhibition of translation caused by inclusion of exon1E in the transcript is quite striking (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh792f4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh792f5">5</xref>). It almost completely blocks both cap-dependent and cap-independent IRES-mediated translation of 1A-transcripts. This is not the first time that a unique splicing event within a 5&#x02032;-UTR has been shown to introduce a translational control element. In fact, the presence of an additional exon (AS) included in the neuronal nitric-oxide synthase (nNOS) 5&#x02032;-UTR by alternative splicing was shown to downregulate translation by stabilizing a stem&#x02013;loop structure. In contrast to the cx43 exon1A-1E 5&#x02032;-UTR, exonAS does not introduce an uAUG in the nNOS 5&#x02032;-UTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh792c44">44</xref>).</p><p>As expected, the cx43 5&#x02032;-UTRs with higher translation efficiencies, comprising exon1A<sub>S</sub>, exon1A and exon1A<sub>L</sub>, lack upstream AUG triplets, whereas those with lowest translational activities (exon1C and exon1A-1E 5&#x02032;-UTRs) contain uAUGs with adequate Kozak consensus sequences. The remaining 5&#x02032;-UTRs, which show intermediate translation efficiencies, contain either two or three additional uAUG, but none of them fit the Kozak consensus sequence for start of translation. The presence of uAUGs has been shown to downregulate translation mainly by ribosome stalling mechanisms. Some examples of genes regulated by upstream open reading frames (uORFs) include the AdoMetDC enzyme, the C&#x0002f;EBP&#x003b2; transcription factor, the MDM2 oncoprotein and the Xenopus <italic>connexin41</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh792c45">45</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh792c47">47</xref>). Less than 10% of eukaryotic mRNAs contain uAUGs within their transcript leader regions. They are more commonly found in genes that code for regulatory proteins. Cx43 is one of the earliest expressed connexins and has been shown to play a vital role during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh792c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh792c48">48</xref>). Thus, it should not be surprising to find uAUGs regulating the expression of the <italic>cx43</italic> gene.</p><p>It has been known for years that the common exon1A cx43 mRNA is not very efficiently translated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh792c49">49</xref>). Why then would a cell transcribe other mRNAs species that are even more poorly translated as it is the case of the cx43 exon1A-1E mRNA? At present we do not have a clear answer. Perhaps it provides the cell with a way to repress cx43 expression even further at times when promoter P1 cannot be shut off. Or it represents a strategy for the cell to get ready for a sudden upregulation of cx43 triggered by a factor that binds to the 5&#x02032;-UTR thereby releasing the translational repression imposed by exon1E. Alternatively, exon1E's or any of the other exons' function <italic>in vivo</italic> could be dependent on <italic>trans</italic>-factors that are loaded onto the mRNA during splicing and later influence the efficiency of translation. In our transfection assays, we use processed mRNAs and therefore may miss these factors. In support of the latter argument, it has been shown that the nuclear history of a pre-mRNA can determine the translational activity of cytoplasmic mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh792c50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh792c51">51</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Exon1A<sub>L</sub> represses cx43 IRES activity</title><p>Another <italic>cis</italic>-RNA element that seems to modulate translation of exon1A cx43 transcripts was found within exon1A<sub>L</sub>. In contrast to exon1E, the inhibition only affects cap-independent IRES-mediated mechanisms, it barely affects the secondary structure of the 5&#x02032;-UTR and it does not introduce any uAUG (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh792f4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh792f6">6</xref>). But somehow the sequence encompassing nucleotides 5&#x02013;27 of exon 1A<sub>L</sub> from its 5&#x02032; end appears to be responsible for the inhibition since an oligonucleotide annealing to this sequence completely rescues the IRES activity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh792f6">6</xref>). It is possible that the structure of the extra stem&#x02013;loop introduced by the exon1A<sub>S</sub> sequence inhibits the IRES activity <italic>per se</italic>, or that the binding of an IRES repressor is obstructed by the presence of the anti-sense oligo. Whatever the mechanism might be we do not understand at present the biological significance of this <italic>cis</italic>-RNA element inhibitory of IRES activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Does cx43 transcription affect the downstream splicing events?</title><p>It was interesting to note that splicing of only certain exon combinations was allowed. And that exon choice seemed dependent on promoter usage and cell-type context. For example, exon1D appears linked only to exons 1B<sub>S</sub> or 1C, which are generated by transcription either from promoter P2 or P3 but it is never included in transcripts originating from promoter P1. Similarly, exon1E is only included in transcripts originating from promoter P1 but is never present in transcripts originating from either of the other two promoters. In addition, the frequency of exon skipping&#x0002f;inclusion and in consequence the relative abundance of 5&#x02032;-UTRs containing one or two exons appears to be determined by the tissue source. This can be seen when the intensities of the faster moving bands (exon skipping) and the slower moving bands (exon inclusion) corresponding to exons 1B and 1C mRNAs are compared in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh792f1">1</xref>A. It is also indicated by the more frequent inclusion of exon1E in the atria, which is rarely included in the septum and which is skipped in the ventricle. On the basis of these observations, we would like to hypothesize that during splicing of the cx43 pre-mRNA exon choice is determined by the promoter at which transcription was initiated. Recently, splicing decisions have been shown to depend on the binding of transcription factors such as the estrogen receptors to synthetic promoters that contain estrogen response elements in a hormone-dependent manner, in a process termed co-transcriptional splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh792c52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh792c53">53</xref>). Ini, a novel transcription factor cloned in our laboratory which binds to the rat cx43 promoter and which seems to play a role during splicing in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh792c54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh792c55">55</xref>) may be a good candidate to coordinate transcription and splicing and perhaps also translation of the <italic>cx43</italic> gene.</p><p>We still do not understand why the cell requires nine different mRNA species coding for cx43. The key to the answer probably resides in the necessity for finely modulating intercellular communication in a cell type and context-dependent manner. Targeted ablation of each of the new exons in mice may lead to the generation of viable individuals with specific defects that may allow us to link the requirement of these new exons with certain physiological processes.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkh792f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Identification of new connexin43 5&#x02032;-UTRs in mouse.
