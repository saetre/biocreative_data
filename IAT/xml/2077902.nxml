However, neither of these cell types express signaling lymphocyte activation molecule (CD150), which has been identified as the receptor for wild-type MV. We have infected rhesus and cynomolgus macaques with a recombinant MV strain expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP); thus bringing together the optimal animal model for measles and a virus that can be detected with unprecedented sensitivity. Blood samples and broncho-alveolar lavages were collected every 3 d, and necropsies were performed upon euthanasia 9 or 15 d after infection. EGFP production by MV-infected cells was visualized macroscopically, in both living and sacrificed animals, and microscopically by confocal microscopy and FACS analysis. At the peak of viremia, EGFP fluorescence was detected in skin, respiratory and digestive tract, but most intensely in all lymphoid tissues. B- and T-lymphocytes expressing CD150 were the major target cells for MV infection. Highest percentages (up to 30&#x00025;) of infected lymphocytes were detected in lymphoid tissues, and the virus preferentially targeted cells with a memory phenotype. Unexpectedly, circulating monocytes did not sustain productive MV infection. In peripheral tissues, large numbers of MV-infected CD11c<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> MHC class-II<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> myeloid dendritic cells were detected in conjunction with infected T-lymphocytes, suggesting transmission of MV between these cell types. Fluorescent imaging of MV infection in non-human primates demonstrated a crucial role for lymphocytes and dendritic cells in the pathogenesis of measles and measles-associated immunosuppression.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>Measles remains one of the most important causes of childhood mortality in developing countries. The virus is highly infectious and is spread via the respiratory route. According to textbook descriptions, measles virus first infects respiratory epithelial cells, followed by viremia mediated by infected monocytes. However, this order of events is inconsistent with current knowledge about receptor usage by measles virus strains. In this paper we have revisited the pathogenesis of measles by infecting non-human primates with a recombinant measles virus expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein. An important advantage of this system is that infected cells become fluorescent and can be detected with high sensitivity in living animals as well as tissue samples. Strikingly, at the peak of virus replication all lymphoid tissues were strongly fluorescent, and up to 10&#x00025; of T-lymphocytes and 30&#x00025; of B-lymphocytes were infected. In peripheral tissues the virus predominantly infected lymphocytes and dendritic cells, although to a lesser extent respiratory epithelial cells were also infected. We hypothesize that measles virus, like human immunodeficiency virus, utilizes dendritic cells as a vehicle to establish infection of the lymphoid system and cause immunosuppression. This study reshapes our basic view of measles pathogenesis.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>de Swart RL, Ludlow M, de Witte L, Yanagi Y, van Amerongen G, et al.

In submucosal tissues we detected large numbers of MV-infected lymphocytes and DCs in aggregates of inflammatory cells. Finally, MV infection was also detected in the epithelia of mouth and trachea.</p><p>We identified CD150<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> B- and T-lymphocytes as major targets for MV infection in vivo.

However, the samples used in those studies were collected after onset of rash, and these results may have reflected binding of opsonized virus particles to Fc-receptors rather than active virus replication. Our data are in accordance with the observation that non-activated human monocytes do not express CD150 and are only inefficiently infected in vitro &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030178-b010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030178-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;.

Estimations of MV-infected cells in PBMCs by an infectious center assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030178-g001">Figure 1</xref>B) or by EGFP detection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030178-g003">Figure 3</xref>) suggested that the latter method was one to two log values more sensitive. This clearly illustrates the strength of our model based on infection with an autofluorescent virus as compared to conventional pathogenesis studies.</p><p>MHC class II<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> CD11c<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DCs in the dermis of the skin and the submucosa of respiratory and digestive tracts were identified as a second major target cell population for MV infection. Since DCs are known to express CD150 and can be infected with MV in vitro, a role for this cell population in the pathogenesis of measles had been hypothesized &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030178-b041">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030178-b042">42</xref>&#x0005d;. Here we formally prove that this is indeed the case in macaques in vivo. Interestingly, infected DCs in our study were in many cases found in association with lymphoid tissue or aggregates of inflammatory cells near hair follicles and mucous glands. Theoretically DCs could also have become fluorescent by uptake of EGFP rather than by MV-infection. However, this is unlikely to result in high EGFP expression levels as those observed in our study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030178-g005">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030178-g006">6</xref>). We are currently undertaking additional studies to further characterize the phenotype and functionality of these infected DCs.</p><p>Our observation that high percentages of infected lymphocytes and DCs were detected in lymphoid tissues of infected macaques sheds new light on measles-associated immunosuppression. Measles causes lymphopenia &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030178-b003">3</xref>&#x0005d;, which has previously been attributed to apoptosis of uninfected cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030178-b040">40</xref>&#x0005d;. Our data suggest that actual depletion of the many MV-infected lymphocytes may contribute significantly to the observed lymphopenia. In addition, MV was found to preferentially infect CD150<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> lymphocytes with a memory phenotype (CD45RA<sup>&#x02212;</sup>). This is in accordance with data recently published by Condack et al<italic>.</italic>, describing the preferential MV-infection of human memory T-lymphocytes as compared to naive T-lymphocytes in ex vivo infection studies in human tonsillar tissue &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030178-b037">37</xref>&#x0005d;. Overall, these data strongly suggest that depletion of memory T- and B-lymphocytes as a direct consequence of MV infection may play an important role in immunosuppression. In addition, MV infection of DCs may lead to immune modulation as previously demonstrated in ex vivo studies &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030178-b041">41</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030178-b043">43</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Levels of MV-infected cells varied substantially between individual animals. Whereas the viral load in PBMCs of animal &#x00023;R3 resembled those detected in the other animals, the absolute percentages of EGFP-positive cells were much lower (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030178-g003">Figure 3</xref>B). This animal also had the lowest percentages of EGFP-positive cells in lymphoid tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030178-g003">Figure 3</xref>C), and no EGFP expression was macroscopically detected in the skin. This variation in responses is likely related to the use of outbred non-SPF animals, and may reflect natural variations in the course of measles in humans, where children may develop either mild or more severe measles.</p><p>The case-fatality rate of measles in humans is approximately 0.01&#x00025; in industrialized countries, but may be up to 10&#x00025; in developing countries &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030178-b044">44</xref>&#x0005d;. The increased mortality may be explained by factors such as crowding, poor supportive care, and the high pressure of opportunistic infections &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030178-b045">45</xref>&#x0005d;, which are often considered to be the ultimate cause of measles-associated mortality &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030178-b003">3</xref>&#x0005d;. However, opportunistic infections may also influence the pathogenesis of measles by another mechanism. Our data demonstrate that CD150<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> lymphocytes are major targets for MV replication. Opportunistic pathogens may cause chronic immune activation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030178-b046">46</xref>&#x0005d;, likely resulting in higher numbers of CD150<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> lymphocytes in circulation and in lymphoid tissues. This suggests that chronic immune activation from high pathogen pressure may facilitate MV replication and spread, thus increasing the severity of MV infection.</p><p>Apart from MV infection of lymphocytes and DCs, we also detected MV infection in the squamous stratified epithelium of tongue and buccal mucosa and in the ciliated epithelium of the trachea. In these tissues infection was associated with syncytium formation. Since epithelial cells do not express CD150, these observations suggest the possibility of non-CD150&#x02013;mediated MV infection and spread. In previous in vitro studies it was shown that MV could infect human primary small airway epithelial cells or lung carcinoma cells via a CD150- and CD46-independent mechanism, resulting in the formation of syncytia &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030178-b011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030178-b047">47</xref>&#x0005d;.

However, it remains unclear how the virus gains access to this organ. Given its high person-to-person transmissibility, the virus would need an easily accessible target cell in the upper respiratory or digestive tract that could &#x0201c;trap&#x0201d; the virus and subsequently transport it into lymphoid tissues. The observed substantial MV infection of DCs suggests that CD150<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DCs may fulfill this role, as has also been suggested for HIV-1 infection &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030178-b048">48</xref>&#x0005d;. Notably, DC-SIGN was recently identified as a new attachment receptor for MV, which could enhance viral transmission to CD150<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> lymphocytes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030178-b049">49</xref>&#x0005d;. Whether this process takes place at the respiratory mucosa, in the tonsillar crypts, or elsewhere will need to be determined in future studies focusing on earlier time points after MV infection.</p><p>In conclusion, our data demonstrate that in non-human primates MV targets CD150<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> lymphocytes and CD11c<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> myeloid cells, and to a lesser extent epithelial cells. In contrast to previous studies in human measles patients, circulating monocytes in peripheral blood do not sustain productive MV infection in macaques. Although the experiments described here are based on a single recombinant MV strain, and important differences may exist between the course of MV infection in humans and macaques, these data warrant re-evaluation of the tropism of MV in humans. This non-human primate model provides new opportunities to address specific aspects of measles pathogenesis in vivo.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Study design.</title><p>Three cynomolgus macaques (animals &#x00023;C1&#x02013;3) and three rhesus macaques (animals &#x00023;R1&#x02013;3) were infected by intra-tracheal inoculation with 10<sup>4</sup> cell culture infectious dose-50 of MV-IC323-EGFP diluted to a volume of 5 ml in phosphate buffered saline (PBS).

Fluorescence was detected in a FACSCalibur, obtaining approximately 500,000 events to allow detection of low-frequent EGFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> subpopulations. Lymphoid tissues were minced, and single cell suspensions were prepared by using cell strainers with 100-&#x003bc;m pore size (BD Biosciences); these cells were directly used for FACS analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4g"><title>Skin cultures.</title><p>Shaven skin sections were collected in PBS during necropsies and processed as previously described &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030178-b034">34</xref>&#x0005d; with adaptations. Briefly, tissues were incubated overnight in trypsin (0.05&#x00025;), after which dermis and epidermis were mechanically separated. The two tissues were subsequently cultured for 2 d in complete medium to allow DCs to migrate out of the tissue. The single cell suspension that remained in the medium was used for FACS analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4h"><title>Preparation of tissue samples for vibratome sectioning.</title><p>4&#x00025; (w/v) paraformaldehyde-fixed tissue samples were immersed in 0.2 M sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.2) for 20 min and embedded in 5&#x00025; (w/v) agarose (Type VII low gelling temperature, Sigma) in PBS. A vibratome (Leica Microsystems) was used to cut serial 100-&#x003bc;m sections into 0.2 M TRIS buffered saline.

Sections were incubated overnight at 4 &#x000b0;C in an appropriate primary antibody diluted in PBS with 0.1&#x00025; (v/v) TX-100 and 1&#x00025; (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA). Monoclonal antibodies to CD20 (1:100, DAKO) and CD3 (1:100, DAKO) were used to detect B- and T-lymphocytes, respectively. CAM 5.2 was used to detect cells of an epithelial origin. After incubation in primary antibodies, tissue sections were rinsed three times in PBS with 0.1&#x00025; (v/v) TX-100. Sections were incubated for 2 h at room temperature in goat anti-mouse Alexa 568 or goat anti-mouse Alexa 647 (Molecular Probes) diluted in PBS with 0.1&#x00025; TX-100 (v/v) and 1&#x00025; (w/v) BSA.

Sections were incubated in primary antibody overnight at 4 &#x000b0;C, and specific antibody-antigen binding sites were detected using an Envision-Peroxidase system with DAB (DAKO) as substrate. Single and dual labeling immunofluorescence was performed using anti-EGFP and monoclonal antibodies to the DC marker CD11c (Novacastra), the macrophage cell marker Mac387 (Abcam), and the epithelial cell&#x02013;specific marker CAM 5.2 (Becton-Dickinson). Antigen binding sites were detected with either goat anti-mouse or anti-rabbit Alexa 488 or 568 (Molecular Probes).
