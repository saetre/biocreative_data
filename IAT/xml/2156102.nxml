Some bacterial toxins mimic eukaryotic Rho GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) to inactivate mammalian GTPases, probably as a result of evolutionary convergence. An intriguing question remains whether eukaryotic pathogens or parasites may use endogenous GAPs as immune-suppressive toxins to target the same key genes as bacterial pathogens. Interestingly, a RhoGAP domain&#x02013;containing protein, LbGAP, was recently characterized from the parasitoid wasp <named-content content-type="genus-species">Leptopilina boulardi</named-content>, and shown to protect parasitoid eggs from the immune response of <italic>Drosophila</italic> host larvae. We demonstrate here that LbGAP has structural characteristics of eukaryotic RhoGAPs but that it acts similarly to bacterial RhoGAP toxins in mammals. First, we show by immunocytochemistry that LbGAP enters <italic>Drosophila</italic> immune cells, plasmatocytes and lamellocytes, and that morphological changes in lamellocytes are correlated with the quantity of LbGAP they contain. Demonstration that LbGAP displays a GAP activity and specifically interacts with the active, GTP-bound form of the two <italic>Drosophila</italic> Rho GTPases Rac1 and Rac2, both required for successful encapsulation of <italic>Leptopilina</italic> eggs, was then achieved using biochemical tests, yeast two-hybrid analysis, and GST pull-down assays. In addition, we show that the overall structure of LbGAP is similar to that of eukaryotic RhoGAP domains, and we identify distinct residues involved in its interaction with Rac GTPases. Altogether, these results show that eukaryotic parasites can use endogenous RhoGAPs as virulence factors and that despite their differences in sequence and structure, eukaryotic and bacterial RhoGAP toxins are similarly used to target the same immune pathways in insects and mammals.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>Recent data have highlighted strong similarities between insect and mammalian immune pathways, raising the question whether they might be similarly targeted by parasites/pathogens. Endoparasitoid wasps are insect mortality agents that perform their development inside their host. They are widely used in biological control, but little is known of the way in which they disable the host immune response. Here, we report the first characterization to our knowledge of a protein&#x02013;protein interaction between a parasitoid immune-suppressive factor, LbGAP, and its host targets, thus explaining its physiological effects on host immune cells. Strikingly, bacterial toxins containing a domain functionally related to that of LbGAP are known to alter human macrophages by targeting the same molecules. Demonstration that insect and mammalian pathogens/parasites, whether eukaryotic or prokaryotic, can use evolutionary convergent molecules &#x0201c;built&#x0201d; to target the same key factors in immune pathways, represents a new step in understanding the evolution of host&#x02013;pathogen interactions. In addition to the potential of discovering new bioinsectides, studying virulence strategies of insect parasites might thus help to better characterize vertebrate&#x02013;pathogen interactions and to assess the role of evolutionary convergence in the evolution of virulence.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Colinet D, Schmitz A, Depoix D, Crochard D, Poiri&#x000e9; M (2007) Convergent use of RhoGAP toxins by eukaryotic parasites and bacterial pathogens.

Insect hosts have evolved immune defenses against parasitoids that, if successful, result in the formation of a melanized capsule around the wasp egg and end with the death of the parasitoid &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030203-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030203-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d;.

Plasmatocytes are first seen attaching to the parasitoid egg and spreading around it.

In particular, parasitoid induction of changes in morphology and adhesion properties of host hemocytes has been repeatedly described &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030203-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;, as for bacterial pathogens of mammals, but still remains poorly understood. This is at least partly due to the lack of information on the molecular targets of parasitoid toxins in the host. Virulent strains of <named-content content-type="genus-species">Leptopilina boulardi</named-content>, a specialist parasitoid of <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. melanogaster</named-content>, induce changes in the morphology of host lamellocytes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030203-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d; and disrupt the encapsulation process. A RhoGAP domain&#x02013;containing protein (LbGAP, previously known as P4) was recently characterized from parasitoid female venom glands &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0030203-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;.

These results led us to investigate the function of LbGAP in the disruption of the encapsulation process, to characterize its targets inside the host and to compare LbGAP characteristics with those of bacterial GAP toxins. We first report that LbGAP enters <italic>Drosophila</italic> plasmatocytes and lamellocytes and that the quantity of LbGAP inside lamellocytes correlates with the level of morphological changes of these cells. We then demonstrate that LbGAP displays GAP activity and specifically interacts with the active, GTP-bound form of the two <italic>Drosophila</italic> Rho GTPases, Rac1 and Rac2. In addition, we show that the overall structure of LbGAP is similar to that of eukaryotic RhoGAP domains, and we identify distinct residues involved in its interaction with Rac GTPases. We thus demonstrate that eukaryotic parasites can use endogenous RhoGAPs as virulence factors and that, despite their differences in sequence and structure, eukaryotic and bacterial RhoGAPs are similarly used to target insect and mammalian host immune pathways. This result will help to assess the role of evolutionary convergence in the evolution of virulence.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>LbGAP Enters <italic>Drosophila</italic> Lamellocytes</title><p>To investigate whether LbGAP enters <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. melanogaster</named-content> hemocytes, <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae were parasitized by <named-content content-type="genus-species">L. boulardi</named-content> females and LbGAP was detected inside hemocyte cells using immunofluorescence. Using LbGAP-specific antibody, we readily detected LbGAP as spots in both plasmatocytes and lamellocytes, whereas no signal was detected in hemocytes from non-parasitized hosts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030203-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). LbGAP staining was never localized either at the periphery of the lamellocytes or on the nucleus, thus evidencing that the protein is present inside these very flat cells. Most plasmatocytes displayed a high number of LbGAP spots whatever the time post-infestation. In contrast, the number of LbGAP-stained lamellocytes, as well as the number of lamellocytes containing a high number of spots, significantly increased with the time post-infestation (chi<sup>2</sup> &#x0003d; 126.26; df &#x0003d; 3; p &#x0003c;0.001 and chi<sup>2</sup> &#x0003d; 19.9; df &#x0003d; 1; p &#x0003c;0.01, respectively). Spots were detected inside 45&#x00025; to 50&#x00025; of lamellocytes 6 hours after parasitism and inside 70&#x00025; of lamellocytes 48 hours post-infestation. The proportion of modified lamellocytes also increased with the time post-infestation, reaching more than 60&#x00025; 48 hours following parasitism. Finally, a significant correlation was observed between the level of morphological changes of lamellocytes and the number of LbGAP spots they contain when categorizing cells according to their shape and the number of recorded spots (chi<sup>2</sup> &#x0003d; 402.92; df &#x0003d; 9; p &#x0003c;0.001). Bipolar modified cells had usually considerable LbGAP staining, whereas most discoidal unmodified lamellocytes did not contain any spot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0030203-g001">Figure 1</xref>B).
