The oxidation of DNA has been shown to apparently result in either spontaneous mutagenesis or cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh214c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh214c2">2</xref>), thus causing various age-related diseases such as cancer and neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh214c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh214c4">4</xref>). Among the various types of oxidized damage in DNA, 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG), an oxidized form of guanine, can pair with adenine as well as cytosine during DNA replication, and this action is considered to be one of the spontaneous causes of a G:C to T:A transversion mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh214c5">5</xref>).</p><p>To minimize such spontaneous mutagenesis, organisms come equipped with elaborated repair enzymes, namely 8-oxoG DNA glycosylase which excises 8-oxoG opposite cytosine in DNA, and adenine DNA glycosylase which removes adenine incorporated opposite 8-oxoG in template DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh214c6">6</xref>). In <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, <italic>mutM</italic> (<italic>fpg</italic>) gene encoding the former DNA glycosylase, and <italic>mutY</italic> gene encoding the latter play important roles in the prevention of such spontaneous mutagenesis, especially in G:C to T:A transversion mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh214c7">7</xref>). Most eukaryotic cells also possess either a MutM homolog or its functional homolog, OGG1 for the repair of 8-oxoG, and a MutY homolog (MUTYH or MYH) for the repair of adenine opposite 8-oxoG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh214c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh214c8">8</xref>).</p><p>Recently, familial alterations in the human <italic>MUTYH</italic> gene have been reported to be possible causative mutations for certain types of autosomal recessive colorectal adenomatous polyposis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh214c9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh214c12">12</xref>), thus suggesting that the absence of the MUTYH function in human cells might also result in a mutator phenotype. Among the many genes involved in base excision repair (BER), <italic>MUTYH</italic> is the first candidate gene for a hereditary neoplasm in human beings. We recently generated MUTYH-null mouse embryonic stem (ES) cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh214c2">2</xref>), and reported that the spontaneous mutation rate in the MUTYH-null cells increased 2-fold in comparison to wild-type cells, thus indicating that the absence of the MUTYH function in mammalian cells results in a moderate mutator phenotype.</p><p>In human cells, we previously reported that there are three major <italic>MUTYH</italic> transcripts, namely type &#x003b1;&#x0002c; &#x003b2; and &#x003b3; with a different 5&#x02032; sequence or first exon and each transcript is alternatively spliced, thus multi-forms of human MUTYH (hMUTYH) proteins are present in the nuclei and in the mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh214c13">13</xref>). hMUTYH protein encoded by type &#x003b1; mRNA possesses a mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS), consisting of the amino terminal 14 residues which are required for its localization in the mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh214c14">14</xref>), while those encoded by type &#x003b2; and &#x003b3; mRNAs lack the MTS, and are localized in the nuclei. As a result, the subcellular localization of hMUTYH in human cells indicates that mitochondrial DNA is an important target for BER initiated by MUTYH as well as OGG1, probably because of their increased oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh214c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh214c16">16</xref>). Interestingly, rodent MUTYH proteins deduced from mouse and rat MUTYH cDNA clones lack an amino-terminal sequence corresponding to the MTS in hMUTYH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh214c17">17</xref>), thus raising the question as to whether or not mitochondrial forms of MUTYH exist in rodents.</p><p>In the present study, we identified three alternatively spliced <italic>Mutyh</italic> mRNAs from mouse ES cells and mouse tissues, and found these <italic>Mutyh</italic> mRNAs to encode two different forms of mouse MUTYH (mMUTYH) protein. An analysis of the subcellular distribution of the two mMUTYH proteins revealed that these proteins are mostly localized in the nuclei and to some extent in the mitochondria.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Oligonucleotides</title><p>Oligonucleotides shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh214tb1">1</xref>, were obtained from Greiner Japan, and Hokkaido System Science.</p></sec><sec><title>Isolation of genomic clones for <italic>Mutyh</italic></title><p>Using the <italic>Mutyh</italic> type b cDNA as a probe, three independent phage clones were obtained from the &#x003bb; phage genomic library for 129SvJ mouse (Stratagene).</p></sec><sec><title>RNA</title><p>Total RNA from the cultured cells and various tissues of C57BL6/J mice was prepared using ISOGEN (Nippon Gene), and total RNA from tissues of BALB/c mice were purchased from Clontech.</p></sec><sec><title>Quantitative RT&#x02013;PCR</title><p>RT&#x02013;PCR for <italic>Mutyh</italic> and <italic>Gapdh</italic> mRNA was performed as follows.

Sequence analysis revealed that there are three different <italic>Mutyh</italic> cDNAs (368, 440, 533 bp) corresponding to the bands shown with arrowheads in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh214f1">1</xref>C, with or without 93- and/or 74-base insertion, and that other smaller bands are incompletely elongated <italic>Mutyh</italic> cDNAs.</p><p>Based on the most 5&#x02032;-sequence of the <italic>Mutyh</italic> cDNA obtained, we further performed a RT&#x02013;PCR analysis of total RNA prepared from mouse ES cells and tissues of BALB/c mice using a primer set, mY5B1 &#x0002b; mY3A1. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh214f1">1</xref>D, three bands corresponding to 529, 436 and 362 bp fragments were detected, and thus transcripts corresponding to these cDNAs were designated as type a, b and c <italic>Mutyh</italic> mRNA, respectively. In each sample, type b mRNA was a major form of <italic>Mutyh</italic> mRNA and very low levels of type a and c mRNAs were detected, but in brain, type c was as abundant as type b. These cDNA fragments were again subcloned, and their sequences were confirmed (data not shown). To examine whether there were full-length mRNAs carrying these alternative 5&#x02032; sequences, we again performed RT&#x02013;PCR analysis of total RNA prepared from CCE28 cells and brain using a primer set, mY5B1 &#x0002b; mY3TGA. A major 1.6 kb band corresponding to the full-length type b cDNA was amplified from CCE28 RNA, while a slightly smaller band corresponding to the full-length type c cDNA, as well as the 1.6 kb band was amplified from brain RNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh214f1">1</xref>E), thus confirming that there are at least two types of full-length <italic>Mutyh</italic> mRNAs in mouse brain.</p><p>Then we isolated several independent phage clones from a &#x003bb; phage genomic DNA library derived from 129SvJ mouse, and determined sequences flanking each exon. The <italic>Mutyh</italic> gene spans 12 kb and consists of 17 exons (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh214f2">2</xref>B), and sequence comparison with the three types of <italic>Mutyh</italic> cDNA revealed that exon 2 and exon 6 are alternatively spliced to generate three types of <italic>Mutyh</italic> transcripts, namely type a, b and c (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh214f2">2</xref>A). The sequence of each exon&#x02013;intron junction was completely conserved in <italic>Mutyh</italic> gene of C57BL/6J strain &#x0005b;S.Blakey (2002) DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank accession no.

The expression level of <italic>Mutyh</italic> mRNA was determined by amplifying the common 3&#x02032;-region for the three types of <italic>Mutyh</italic> mRNA with a primer set of mY5A2 and mY3TGA, and was normalized to that of <italic>Gapdh</italic> mRNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh214f3">3</xref>, top and middle panels). Thymus, small intestine, lung and heart expressed high levels of <italic>Mutyh</italic> mRNAs, and cerebellum, large intestine, liver and cerebrum expressed slightly lower levels of <italic>Mutyh</italic> mRNA than did the former. The expression level of <italic>Mutyh</italic> mRNA in thymus was the highest among all examined tissues.</p><p>In order to compare expression levels of the three types of <italic>Mutyh</italic> mRNAs in each tissue, RT&#x02013;PCR with a primer set of mY5B1 &#x0002b; mY3A1 was performed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh214f3">3</xref>, bottom panel). In most tissues examined, type b mRNA was the major form, while in the cerebellum almost equal amounts of type b and c <italic>Mutyh</italic> mRNAs were detected. Relatively high levels of type c mRNA were detected in the cerebrum, heart, lung and thymus in addition to cerebellum, while much lower levels of type a <italic>Mutyh</italic> mRNA were detected in some tissues such as the large intestine. As a result, we concluded that three types of <italic>Mutyh</italic> mRNA formed by alternative splicing were indeed expressed <italic>in vivo</italic>, and their expression levels vary among tissues.</p></sec><sec><title>Two types of mouse MUTYH protein encoded by alternatively spliced transcripts</title><p>Among the three types of <italic>Mutyh</italic> mRNAs, type a and type b completely share their open reading frames, indicating that they encode the same mMUTYH protein, namely mMUTYH&#x003b1; (516 aa, MW: 57 686)&#x0002c; while type c mRNA shares only the C-terminal part of its open reading frame with those of type a and b (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh214f4">4</xref>A), and thus encoding mMUTYH protein with a unique N-terminus, designated as mMUTYH&#x003b2; (429 aa, MW: 47 197) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh214f4">4</xref>B). As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh214f5">5</xref>A, bands corresponding to 50&#x02013;54 kDa, which reacted with anti-hMUTYH antibody, were produced by an <italic>in vitro</italic> translation of type b <italic>Mutyh</italic> mRNA, while 45&#x02013;47 kDa bands were detected in an <italic>in vitro</italic> translation product of type c <italic>Mutyh</italic> mRNA by the anti-hMUTYH. mRNA for the nuclear type of hMUTYH produced a polypeptide which co-migrated with mMUTYH&#x003b1;.</p><p>By western blotting analysis using anti-hMUTYH (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh214f5">5</xref>B), two upper bands whose sizes were approximately 50&#x02013;54 kDa and one lower band corresponding to a 47 kDa polypeptide were detected in the wild-type ES cell line, CCE28 cells but not a MUTYH-null ES cell line, YDK15 cells. YDK&#x003b1; cells which received an expression vector for type b <italic>Mutyh</italic> cDNA restored expression of the upper bands but not the lower band, while YDK&#x003b2; cells which received an expression vector for type c <italic>Mutyh</italic> cDNA restored only expression of the lower band, thus confirming that the two forms of mMUTYH protein encoded by alternatively spliced <italic>Mutyh</italic> mRNAs were indeed expressed in ES cells. The expression of the two forms of mMUTYH protein was confirmed in thymocytes prepared from wild-type but not MUTYH-null mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh214f5">5</xref>C), although in MUTYH-null thymocytes, there was a minor 50 kDa band reactive with anti-hMUTYH. We raised antibodies against the amino-terminal region of mMUTYH&#x003b2;, namely anti-mMUTYH&#x003b2;N, and the anti-mMUTYH&#x003b2;N detected a 47 kDa band only in wild-type thymocytes, thus supporting the expression of mMUTYH&#x003b2; in wild-type mice, as expected from the RT&#x02013;PCR analysis findings shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh214f3">3</xref>.</p></sec><sec><title>Subcellular localization of two forms of mMUTYH protein in mouse ES cells</title><p>Whole cell extracts, nuclear, cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions were prepared from CCE28 and YDK15 cells, and subjected to western blot analysis using anti-hMUTYH.

However, a faint 54 kDa band was also seen in YDK15 cells. It is thus likely that a mitochondrial mMUTYH, if any, comigrates with the nonspecific band detected in YDK15 cells. A 47 kDa mMUTYH&#x003b2;, was hardly detected in any fraction, because its expression level was very low.</p><p>To further evaluate the subcellular localization of mMUTYH in mouse cells, we next prepared thin sections from fixed CCE28, YDK15, YDK&#x003b1; and YDK&#x003b2; cells and the intracellular localization of the authentic mMUTYH was analyzed by electron microscopic immunocytochemistry, using anti-hMUTYH in combination with protein A-gold (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh214f7">7</xref>A). In each of the nuclear and mitochondrial regions from CCE28 cells, specific signals were observed. However, no such signal was observed in YDK15 cells, thus confirming that mMUTYH is indeed localized in the mitochondria as well as in nuclei.</p><p>In YDK&#x003b1; and YDK&#x003b2; cells, slightly less signals were observed both in nuclei and mitochondria. We counted the number of signals in the nuclear and mitochondrial regions in each section (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh214f7">7</xref>B), and the number of both nuclear and mitochondrial signals in CCE28, YDK&#x003b1; and YDK&#x003b2; cells were significantly higher than those in YDK15 cells.</p><p>Recombinant mMUTYH&#x003b1; and mMUTYH&#x003b2; fused to EGFP were expressed in COS-1 cells, and their fluorescence was mostly detected in the nuclei and to a lesser extent in the cytoplasm, and was partly merged with MitoTracker, a mitochondrial fluorescent marker (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh214f8">8</xref>). EGFP itself was evenly distributed in COS-1 cells, while EGFP fused to COX8 mitochondrial targeting sequence was exclusively localized in mitochondria, thus indicating that mMUTYH&#x003b1; and mMUTYH&#x003b2; are both mostly localized in the nuclei and to a much lesser extent in the mitochondria in mouse ES cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Mouse MUTYH&#x003b1; specifically excises adenine opposite 8-oxoguanine and guanine, but lacks AP lyase activity</title><p>In order to characterize the biochemical properties of mMUTYH&#x003b1; and mMUTYH&#x003b2;, we expressed these proteins as thioredoxin fusion proteins (Trx-mMUTYH&#x003b1;&#x0002c; Trx-mMUTYH&#x003b2;) in <italic>E.coli</italic>.

The cleaved product after NaOH treatment comigrated with a marker oligonucleotide with the 3&#x02032;-phosphate group (19-P) but not with the 3&#x02032;-hydroxy group (19-OH), indicating that Trx-mMUTYH&#x003b1; does not possess AP-lyase activity at all.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Among three genes, <italic>MTH1</italic>, <italic>OGG1</italic> and <italic>MUTYH</italic> which play essential roles in preventing spontaneous mutagenesis due to oxidative damage in nucleic acids, <italic>MUTYH</italic> gene has been widely noticed because of its alteration in patients with autosomal recessive colorectal adenomatous polyposis and colorectal cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh214c9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh214c12">12</xref>). We recently demonstrated that a disruption of <italic>Mutyh</italic> gene in mouse embryonic stem cells resulted in a mutator phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh214c2">2</xref>), and we have obtained data supporting the view that MUTYH-null mice are indeed predisposed to colorectal adenomatous polyposis and colorectal cancer (K.Sakamoto, Y.Tominaga, K.Yamauchi, Y.Nakatsu, K.Sakumi, K.Yoshiyama, A.Asaeda, A.Egashira, S.Kura, T.Yao, M.Tsuneyoshi, H.Maki, Y.Nakabeppu and T.Tsuzuki, manuscript in preparation). In the present study, we intensively characterized the expression of mouse <italic>Mutyh</italic> gene and its products both in embryonic stem cells and various mouse tissues, to gain an understanding of the physiological role of MUTYH protein <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>The mouse <italic>Mutyh</italic> gene is located on chromosome 4, and consists of 17 exons among which exons 2 and 6 are alternatively spliced to generate three types of transcripts, type a, b and c. Type a and b transcripts of <italic>Mutyh</italic> produce 50 kDa polypeptide, namely mMUTYH&#x003b1;, while type c produces 47 kDa polypeptide, mMUTYH&#x003b2;. In human cells, the <italic>MUTYH</italic> gene encodes more than 10 transcripts generated by alternative transcription initiation as well as alternative splicing, and those mRNAs produce more than seven different forms of hMUTYH proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh214c13">13</xref>). We and others have demonstrated that hMUTYH polypeptide (522 aa) encoded by type &#x003b2;3, &#x003b2;5 or &#x003b3;3 mRNAs are localized in the nucleus and other isoforms of hMUTYH (546 aa, 536 aa, 535 aa) encoded by type &#x003b1;1, &#x003b1;2 and &#x003b1;3 mRNA are localized in the mitochondria, and that the latter possess MTS at their amino terminal ends, while the former, which are translated from an initiation codon corresponding to the second AUG in the latter, lack MTS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh214c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh214c14">14</xref>). There is a further amino-terminally truncated form of hMUTYH (429 aa) encoded by type &#x003b1;4 and type &#x003b3;4 mRNAs in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh214c13">13</xref>). mMUTYH&#x003b1; corresponds to the nuclear form of hMUTYH, while mMUTYH&#x003b2; corresponds to the last form of hMUTYH whose expression is also high in brain.</p><p>We demonstrated the expression of two forms of mMUTYH polypeptide in mouse ES cells and thymocytes as well as expression of three forms of <italic>Mutyh</italic> mRNA in various mouse tissues. The expression levels of <italic>Mutyh</italic> mRNAs are highest in the thymus, small intestine and lung among the tissues examined, and in any tissue, type b mRNA encoding mMUTYH&#x003b1; is a major form, while type a also encoding mMUTYH&#x003b1; is a minor form. The expression levels of type c mRNA encoding mMUTYH&#x003b2; are highest in the cerebellum, cerebrum, heart and lung, thus suggesting that the efficiency of alternative splicing to produce each transcript varies among those tissues.</p><p>In ES cells and thymocytes, mMUTYH&#x003b1; is more abundant than mMUTYH&#x003b2;, and both forms are mostly localized in the nuclei, and to some extent in the mitochondria in ES cells. Initially, we could not deduce any MTS-like sequence in either mMUTYH&#x003b1; or mMUTYH&#x003b2;, however, we now suggest that both forms of mMUTYH protein possess different MTS-like sequences as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh214f4">4</xref>B, which were predicted using the iPSORT prediction system (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hypothesiscreator.net/iPSORT">http://hypothesiscreator.net/iPSORT</ext-link>). In addition, it was predicted that both forms share a typical bipartite nuclear localization signal (NLS) in the common C-terminal region while mMUTYH&#x003b2; possesses an additional bipartite NLS in its unique N-terminal region, by PSORT II server (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://psort.nibb.ac.jp">http://psort.nibb.ac.jp</ext-link>) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh214f4">4</xref>B). Probably because of these NLSs, the majority of both forms of mMUTYH seem to be localized in the nuclei. Since oxidative stress is likely to be very high in the mitochondria, and thus the level of 8-oxoG in mitochondrial DNA is known to be higher than that in nuclear DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh214c23">23</xref>), mitochondria come equipped with defense enzymes such as OGG1, MUTYH and MTH1 which play essential roles in avoiding errors caused by 8-oxoG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh214c16">16</xref>). Human cell is equipped with hOGG1-2a which is exclusively located in mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh214c15">15</xref>), however, only one form of OGG1 in rodent cell is likely to be located both in mitochondria as well as nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh214c8">8</xref>). Our results indicate that MUTYH protein also behaves similarly in rodent cells, suggesting that rodent cells may have a different sorting mechanism(s) for such repair proteins between nuclei and mitochondria. Nevertheless, our data indicate that MUTYH plays an important role in maintaining the genetic information in the mitochondrial genome as well as in the nuclear genome in mammalian cells.</p><p>To investigate the biochemical function of the two forms of mMUTYH protein, we prepared their recombinant form; however, we could only obtain mMUTYH&#x003b1; as a soluble form. Using recombinant protein, we demonstrated that mMUTYH&#x003b1; efficiently excises adenine opposite 8-oxoG and guanine as expected, but it lacks AP lyase activity. In the present study, we could not show any biochemical activity of mMUTYH&#x003b2;, because of its unavailability <italic>in vitro</italic>. We expected that mMUTYH&#x003b2; expressed in mouse ES cells may be available for such an <italic>in vitro</italic> study: however, it was somehow hard to establish cell lines expressing a large amount of mMUTYH&#x003b2; in comparison to mMUTYH&#x003b1;. As a result, other expression systems should be examined for this purpose. It is noteworthy that the expression level of type c mRNA in brain or especially cerebellum is higher than in other tissues, thus suggesting that mMUTYH&#x003b2; has a tissue-specific function. It was recently reported that hypoxia induces expression of MUTYH in rat brain, and further that there are at least two isoforms of rat MUTYH (57, 50 kDa) and the 50 kDa isoform is abundant in neuronal mitochondria in the cerebrum and cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh214c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh214c24">24</xref>).</p><p>It is very likely that the 50 kDa isoform of rat MUTYH corresponds to mMUTYH&#x003b2; thus suggesting that mMUTYH&#x003b2; or its equivalents in human and rat may have some function to protect the brain or neurons from DNA damage in mitochondria caused by hypoxia. Judging by their amino acid sequence (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh214f4">4</xref>), such MUTYH isoforms may retain their binding activity to their substrate; however, it still remains to be clarified as to whether or not they retain DNA glycosylase activity, because they all lack the DNA minor groove reading motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh214c25">25</xref>).</p><p>It has now been established that patients with MUTYH mutations in both alleles are highly predisposed to tumorigenesis in the colon, and our long-term observation of MUTYH-null mice is likely to support this observation. In mice, the highest expression level of type b <italic>Mutyh</italic> mRNA was observed in the small intestine and to a lesser extent in the large intestine, where no type c mRNA was detected, thus suggesting that MUTYH&#x003b1; may be sufficient to prevent the occurrence of mutations in these tissues.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkh214f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> The detection of multiple forms of <italic>Mutyh</italic> mRNA in mouse embryonic stem cells and tissues.
