Two distinct Ogg1 isoforms are present; &#x003b1;-Ogg1, which mainly localizes to the nucleus and &#x003b2;-Ogg1, which localizes only to mitochondria. We recently showed that mitochondria from &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup> cells, which lack mitochondrial DNA, have similar 8-oxoG DNA glycosylase activity to that of wild-type cells. Here, we show that &#x003b2;-Ogg1 protein levels are &#x0223c;80% reduced in &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup> cells, suggesting &#x003b2;-Ogg1 is not responsible for 8-oxoG incision in mitochondria. Thus, we characterized the biochemical properties of recombinant &#x003b2;-Ogg1. Surprisingly, recombinant &#x003b2;-Ogg1 did not show any significant 8-oxoG DNA glycosylase activity <italic>in vitro</italic>. Since &#x003b2;-Ogg1 lacks the C-terminal &#x003b1;O helix present in &#x003b1;-Ogg1, we generated mutant proteins with various amino acid substitutions in this domain. Of the seven amino acid positions substituted (317&#x02013;323), we identified Val-317 as a novel critical residue for 8-oxoG binding and incision. Our results suggest that the &#x003b1;O helix is absolutely necessary for 8-oxoG DNA glycosylase activity, and thus its absence may explain why &#x003b2;-Ogg1 does not catalyze 8-oxoG incision <italic>in vitro</italic>. Western blot analysis revealed the presence of significant amounts of &#x003b1;-Ogg1 in human mitochondria. Together with previous localization studies <italic>in vivo</italic>, this suggests that &#x003b1;-Ogg1 protein may provide the 8-oxoG DNA glycosylase activity for the repair of these lesions in human mitochondrial DNA. &#x003b2;-Ogg1 may play a novel role in human mitochondria.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated during normal metabolism can oxidize proteins, lipids and nucleic acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh863c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh863c2">2</xref>). Oxidation of DNA is thought to be involved in tumorigenesis, aging and various degenerative disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh863c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh863c4">4</xref>). 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine (8-oxoguanine, 8-oxoG) is perhaps the best-characterized oxidative DNA adduct, and thought to be one of the most common. 8-oxoG pairs with adenine as well as cytosine in DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh863c5">5</xref>). If the adenine opposite 8-oxoG in DNA is not removed GC&#x02192;TA transversions occur during DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh863c6">6</xref>). The major pathway for the removal of 8-oxoG is base excision repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh863c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh863c8">8</xref>). Base excision repair is initiated by a lesion-specific DNA N-glycosylase that recognizes and excises the damaged base. Bacterial Fpg and eukaryotic Ogg1 proteins are the major 8-oxoG DNA glycosylases. Both enzymes possess an associated apurinic&#x0002f;apyrimidinic (AP) lyase activities, such that they remove 8-oxoG and cleave the DNA backbone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh863c9">9</xref>). The biological relevance of the 8-oxoG DNA glycosylase activity is demonstrated by a recent study showing that low Ogg1 activity strongly associates with increased risk of lung cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh863c10">10</xref>).</p><p>Mitochondria are the primary intracellular source of ROS. Particularly high levels of 8-oxoG have been detected in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh863c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh863c11">11</xref>), up to 16 times higher than in nuclear DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh863c12">12</xref>). There is a growing body of evidence that accumulation of damage and mutation in mtDNA may contribute to tumorigenesis, aging and age-associated degenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh863c13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh863c15">15</xref>). Mitochondria also possess an Ogg1 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh863c16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh863c18">18</xref>). Using <italic>OGG1</italic><sup>&#x02212;&#x0002f;&#x02212;</sup> mice, we recently demonstrated that Ogg1 is the only 8-oxoG DNA glycosylase in mouse liver mitochondria and that liver mtDNA from these animals accumulates 20 times more 8-oxoG than wild type (WT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh863c19">19</xref>). Similarly, the disruption of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae OGG1</italic> gene causes spontaneous mutations in mtDNA, doubling the rate of petite formation in comparison to WT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh863c20">20</xref>). Thus, Ogg1 appears to be essential for the maintenance of mtDNA integrity in eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh863c21">21</xref>).</p><p>The human <italic>OGG1</italic> gene has been cloned by several groups [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh863c22">22</xref>)]. It consists of eight exons and produces two major distinct transcripts via alternative splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh863c23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh863c26">26</xref>). Thus, two isoforms of human Ogg1 proteins have been identified: &#x003b1;-Ogg1 (alternatively Ogg1 type 1a), and &#x003b2;-Ogg1 (type 2a). &#x003b1;-Ogg1 mRNA is transcribed from exons 1 to 7, and &#x003b2;-Ogg1 mRNA from exons 1 to 6 plus exon 8. The &#x003b1;-isoform is a 345 amino acids (39 kDa) protein that localizes mainly in nuclei, whereas &#x003b2;-Ogg1 is a 424 amino acids (47 kDa) protein that appears to be localized exclusively in mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh863c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh863c27">27</xref>). These studies, along with one report showing an 8-oxoG DNA glycosylase activity for &#x003b2;-Ogg1 using large amounts of recombinant protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh863c25">25</xref>), led to the idea that &#x003b2;-Ogg1 provides the 8-oxoG DNA glycosylase activity detected in human mitochondrial extracts.</p><p>The first 316 amino acids are common between the two isoforms, whereas the C-termini are quite different. The &#x003b1;-Ogg1 protein has been extensively characterized biochemically and structurally. The active site for DNA glycosylase activity requires Lys-249 and Asp-268, both located in the conserved helix&#x02013;hairpin&#x02013;helix structural element that is followed by a Gly&#x0002f;Pro-rich loop and a conserved aspartic acid motif (HhH-GPD), which is essential for DNA glycosylase as well as DNA binding activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh863c28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh863c30">30</xref>). Arg-154 is required for recognition of the base opposite the damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh863c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh863c31">31</xref>). Amino acid residues 9&#x02013;26 comprise a mitochondrial location signal (MLS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh863c26">26</xref>), though a dominant nuclear localization signal (NLS) is also present in amino acids 335&#x02013;342 [Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh863f1">1</xref>; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh863c32">32</xref>)]. On the other hand, no information regarding substrate specificity, kinetic characteristics or binding activities is available for &#x003b2;-Ogg1.</p><p>Human cells that lack mtDNA (&#x003c1;<sup>0</sup>) are a particularly interesting model for studying the regulation of proteins involved in mtDNA transactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh863c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh863c34">34</xref>), nuclear&#x02013;mitochondrial cross-talk and mitochondrial physiology and biochemistry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh863c35">35</xref>). Although these cells do not have a functional electron transport chain, they still have mitochondria with a transmembrane potential and undergo mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh863c36">36</xref>). We have recently demonstrated that &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup> cells retain most mtDNA repair activities, including 8-oxoG incision activity, at levels only slightly lower than WT cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh863c37">37</xref>). Here, we found a dramatic reduction in &#x003b2;-Ogg1 protein levels in the mitochondria of &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup> cells. In order to reconcile these observations, we purified a recombinant &#x003b2;-Ogg1 protein to characterize its biochemical properties. However, we failed to detect 8-oxoG DNA glycosylase activity in the recombinant protein. Since the C-terminal region of &#x003b1;- and &#x003b2;-Ogg1 differ substantially and &#x003b2;-Ogg1 lacks an &#x003b1;O helix that has been implicated in activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh863c38">38</xref>), we investigated whether the amino acid sequence different for the &#x003b2;-isoform could account for its lack of DNA glycosylase activity. For these studies, we generated a series of mutant proteins, with specific amino acid substitutions in &#x003b1;-Ogg1 to identify the amino acid changes that could account for the inability of &#x003b2;-Ogg1 to catalyze 8-oxoG excision. Our results indicate that the C-terminal &#x003b1;O helix is necessary for Ogg1 activity. We also identified a novel amino acid, Val-317, necessary for the DNA binding and glycosylase activities of this protein.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Chemicals and reagents</title><p>Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail was purchased from Roche.

In the present study, we measured &#x003b2;-Ogg1 protein levels in mitochondria isolated from those cells. Despite similar 8-oxoG incision activities, &#x003b2;-Ogg1 protein level was significantly reduced (&#x0223c;80%) in &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup> cells as determined by western blot analysis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh863f2">2</xref>A and C). These contradictory results suggested that either &#x003b2;-Ogg1 is regulated differentially in &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup> or is not the major 8-oxoG DNA glycosylase in human mitochondria. Thus, we decided to characterize the biochemical properties of recombinant &#x003b2;-Ogg1.</p></sec><sec><title>Purification of human &#x003b2;-Ogg1 protein</title><p>Human &#x003b2;-Ogg1 has a putative membrane-binding domain in the C-terminal portion of the protein (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh863f1">1</xref>). In addition, immunohistochemical studies have suggested that the protein localizes to the inner mitochondrial membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh863c40">40</xref>). In the present study, human &#x003b2;-Ogg1 was expressed as hexa histidine- (His-) and glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tagged proteins, with the tags fused to the N-terminus of the protein. The solubility of the recombinant protein was very low, particularly for the His-tagged protein, possibly due to the acidic and hydrophobic nature of the C-terminus, and it often accumulated in inclusion bodies. To circumvent this problem, His&#x02013;&#x003b2;-Ogg1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh863f3">3</xref>A, lane 4) was co-expressed with the bacterial chaperones GroEL&#x02013;GroES. His&#x02013;&#x003b1;-Ogg1, His&#x02013;&#x003b2;-Ogg1 and GST&#x02013;&#x003b2;-Ogg1 were then purified from <italic>E.coli</italic> expression systems to near homogeneity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh863f3">3</xref>A, lanes 1, 4 and 2, respectively). The estimated molecular masses, as determined from Coomassie blue-stained gels, were in agreement with the calculated molecular masses for the fusion proteins (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh863f3">3</xref>A). The identity of the recombinant proteins was also verified by western blot with His-, GST-, or mtOgg1-antibodies (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Biochemical characterization of &#x003b2;-Ogg1 protein</title><p>&#x003b1;-Ogg1 removes 8-oxoG from DNA and cleaves the DNA strand at the 3&#x02032; side of the resulting AP site via its AP lyase activity (&#x003b2;-elimination). In order to compare the enzymatic activities of &#x003b1;- and &#x003b2;-Ogg1, we performed an incision assay with an 8-oxoG containing oligonucleotide (Supplementary Table I). While His&#x02013;&#x003b1;-Ogg1 efficiently incised the substrate at the 8-oxoG position, GST&#x02013;&#x003b2;-Ogg1 did not generate any cleaved products, even when 100-fold more recombinant &#x003b2;-Ogg1 was used (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh863f3">3</xref>B). Longer incubation times resulted only in the appearance of non-specific cleavage products (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh863f3">3</xref>C). Similar results were obtained with His&#x02013;&#x003b2;-Ogg1 (data not shown). No cleavage products were detected from oligonucleotides containing 8-oxoG&#x0002f;G, 8-oxoG&#x0002f;A, 8-oxoG&#x0002f;T, 8-oxoG&#x0002f;C, G&#x0002f;C and AP site&#x0002f;C in the &#x003b2;-Ogg1 (data not shown). We also failed to detect &#x003b2;-Ogg1 8-oxoG DNA glycosylase activity following various modifications of the assay conditions, including length of oligonucleotides (up to 50mer), pH, NaCl, Zn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> and Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> concentrations (data not shown). Recombinant &#x003b2;-Ogg1 expressed in a baculovirus expression system was also partially purified and analyzed. Again, no incision activity could be detected (data not shown), suggesting that the lack of activity is not due to some required post-translational modification specific to eukaryotic cells.</p><p>&#x003b2;-Ogg1 also did not bind to an oligonucleotide containing 8-oxoG&#x0002f;C, as determined by EMSA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh863f3">3</xref>D). Significant amounts of shifted DNA were observed in the lanes incubated with &#x003b1;-Ogg1, while incubation with &#x003b2;-Ogg1 did not produce any significant complex formation. From these observations, we concluded that the recombinant form of &#x003b2;-Ogg1 does not have 8-oxoG DNA glycosylase activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Effect of the long C-terminal tail of &#x003b2;-Ogg1 on 8-oxoG DNA glycosylase activity</title><p>To investigate the possibility that the longer C-terminal domain of &#x003b2;-Ogg1 inhibits catalytic activity, we generated a chimeric protein comprised of the &#x003b1;-Ogg1 catalytic domain (residues 1&#x02013;327) fused to the &#x003b2;-Ogg1 C-terminal tail (317&#x02013;424) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh863f4">4</xref>A). Due to the cloning strategy, two amino acids (Val&#x02013;Asp) were also inserted into the junction of the MixAB fusion protein. The recombinant chimera (total length 437 amino acids, calculated molecular mass 51.5 kDa) was partially purified as a His-tagged protein (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh863f4">4</xref>B) and quantified by western blot, using a known concentration of His&#x02013;&#x003b1;-Ogg1 as a standard. In the DNA incision assay, the MixAB protein showed similar 8-oxoG DNA glycosylase activity to that of WT &#x003b1;-Ogg1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh863f4">4</xref>C). The partially purified MixAB preparation showed two bands that cross-reacted with the anti-Ogg1 antibody, suggesting that part of the recovered protein had been cleaved into smaller species. To determine whether the glycosylase activity was due to the full length, 51.5 kDa MixAB chimera, or to the smaller, faster migrating species, we performed a NaBH<sub>4</sub>-trapping assay (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh863f4">4</xref>D). In the lanes incubated with MixAB protein, we detected a DNA&#x02013;protein complex of slower mobility (lanes 5&#x02013;7) than WT &#x003b1;-Ogg1 (lanes 2&#x02013;4), suggesting that the MixAB protein retains the 8-oxoG DNA glycosylase activity. These results indicate that the longer C-terminal tail of the recombinant &#x003b2;-Ogg1 <italic>per se</italic> does not cause the lack of 8-oxoG DNA glycosylase activity.</p></sec><sec><title>The role of the phenylalanine residue at position 319 in the C-terminal helix domain of Ogg1</title><p>The function of the unique C-terminus of &#x003b2;-Ogg1 (108 amino acid residues) is not known (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh863f1">1</xref>). Using a secondary structure prediction program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh863c39">39</xref>), we predicted the formation of an &#x003b1;-helix (&#x003b1;O) in the C-terminus of &#x003b1;-Ogg1, but no formation of this &#x003b1;-helix in &#x003b2;-Ogg1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh863f5">5</xref>A). The crystal structure of &#x003b1;-Ogg1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh863c28">28</xref>) confirmed the presence of an &#x003b1;O-helix domain in this region (amino acids 313&#x02013;323). The study of Bruner and colleagues also showed that a phenylalanine residue at position 319 interacts with 8-oxoG, and may be critical for 8-oxoG recognition by the Ogg1 protein (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh863f5">5</xref>B, adapted from Entrez Structure pdb code 1HU0). Van der Kemp and co-workers (2004) recently reported that a F319A mutant &#x003b1;-Ogg1 is deficient in 8-oxoG DNA glycosylase and binding activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh863c38">38</xref>). &#x003b2;-Ogg1 has a leucine at position 319, and thus may not form a complete &#x003b1;-helix in the C-terminus (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh863f5">5</xref>A and B). We aligned the Ogg1 amino acid sequences from various organisms (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh863f5">5</xref>A) and found that Phe-319 is highly conserved in all Ogg1 orthologues except in human &#x003b2;-Ogg1.</p><p>In order to determine whether the phenylalanine to leucine substitution in &#x003b2;-Ogg1 renders it inactive, we mutated Phe-319 in &#x003b1;-Ogg1 to the aliphatic amino acid glycine (F319G), disrupting the aromatic ring of phenylalanine, and to leucine (F319L), as found in &#x003b2;-Ogg1. We purified the His-tagged mutant proteins F319G and F319L. The DNA sequence at the mutated sites of each expression vector was verified (Supplementary Figure 1A), and each protein was purified to homogeneity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh863f6">6</xref>A). A mutant &#x003b2;-Ogg1 protein, in which Leu-319 was substituted by phenylalanine was also generated, and partially purified (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh863f6">6</xref>B).</p><p>Glycosylase activity of the mutant proteins was determined using oligonucleotides containing 8-oxoG&#x0002f;C (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh863f6">6</xref>C). The F319G substitution in &#x003b1;-Ogg1 completely abolished 8-oxoG incision activity in the mutant &#x003b1;-Ogg1 protein (lanes 5&#x02013;7), similarly to the F319A mutant reported by van der Kemp <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh863c38">38</xref>). Interestingly, the F319L substitution in &#x003b1;-Ogg1, as found in &#x003b2;-Ogg1, only partially decreased the activity, as incubation of the substrate with this mutant protein resulted in the generation of incision products (lanes 8&#x02013;10), although the specific activity was 2.1-fold weaker than WT &#x003b1;-Ogg1 (lanes 2&#x02013;4). Conversely, the mutant &#x003b2;-Ogg1 L319F did not show any significant activity (lanes 11&#x02013;13), suggesting that some other amino acid changes in &#x003b2;-Ogg1 cause the lack of glycosylase function. The DNA binding activity of the mutant proteins to 8-oxoG was also characterized (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh863f6">6</xref>D). Surprisingly, the F319L mutant &#x003b1;-Ogg1 protein did not stably bind to the 8-oxoG&#x0002f;C-containing substrate (lanes 8&#x02013;10), even though this mutant showed 8-oxoG incision activity. On the other hand, the lanes incubated with &#x003b2;-Ogg1 L319F mutant showed some DNA binding activity. To confirm that the signal observed in the EMSA gel was indeed from L319F &#x003b2;-Ogg1 mutant protein, an EMSA with cold substrate was resolved in a polyacrylamide gel and transferred to a PVDF membrane, and the membrane hybridized with anti-mtOgg1 antibody. As shown in Supplementary Figure 1B, the shifted signal in a radioactive EMSA corresponded to the western blot signal of &#x003b2;-Ogg1. These observations suggest that Phe-319 is important, but its substitution alone does not explain the lack of 8-oxoG DNA glycosylase activity in &#x003b2;-Ogg1.</p></sec><sec><title>The role of the &#x003b1;O helix domain for 8-oxoG glycosylase activity</title><p>Since the L319F substitution did not render &#x003b2;-Ogg1 an active glycosylase, we systematically mutated each amino acid in the 317&#x02013;323 region of &#x003b1;-Ogg1 to the corresponding amino acid in the &#x003b2;-Ogg1 sequence, generating the mutants V317G, F319L, S320G, A321N, D322A, L323F (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh863f7">7</xref>A). A mutant &#x003b1;-Ogg1 in which the entire 317&#x02013;323 stretch was substituted for the &#x003b2;-Ogg1 sequence was also generated (317&#x02013;323&#x0002f;&#x003b1;-&#x003b2;). To further test the effect of end-capping of the &#x003b1;O-helix domain, the R324D mutant protein was also prepared. In order to investigate a possible contribution of the C-terminal portion (amino acids 326&#x02013;345), a mutant protein lacking this region was generated (Stop325). These proteins were then expressed, partially purified and quantified by western blot. In NaBH<sub>4</sub>-mediated DNA trapping assays with 8-oxoG&#x0002f;C (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh863f7">7</xref>B), the mutant proteins V317G and F319L showed significantly weaker complex formation with 8-oxoG&#x0002f;C, indicative of lower DNA glycosylase activity. DNA&#x02013;enzyme complex trapping was completely eliminated in the 317&#x02013;323&#x0002f;&#x003b1;-&#x003b2; mutant protein. Accordingly, 8-oxoG incision (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh863f7">7</xref>C) and DNA binding (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh863f7">7</xref>D) activity were much reduced in the V317G mutant compared with WT, and completely abolished in the 317&#x02013;323&#x0002f;&#x003b1;-&#x003b2; mutant. These results suggest that Val-317 is a critical residue for 8-oxoG DNA glycosylase activity, a residue that had not been identified previously.</p><p>We next generated the corresponding &#x003b2;-Ogg1 mutant proteins in which positions 317 and 319 contained the amino acids found in &#x003b1;-Ogg1, G317V and G317V&#x0002f;L319F. However, neither substitution significantly increased 8-oxoG DNA incision or binding activities in these mutants protein (data not shown). It is possible that the &#x003b1;O-helix formation is still incomplete in these mutant proteins.</p><p>To evaluate the DNA binding activity of &#x003b1;-Ogg1 mutant proteins, EMSA was performed using a synthetic AP site analogue tetrahydrofran (THF)-containing oligonucleotide (Supplementary Figure 2). WT, F319G and F319L proteins showed efficient binding activity to THF, while V317G and 317&#x02013;323&#x0002f;&#x003b1;-&#x003b2; proteins did not. A K249Q mutant protein, previously shown to lack 8-oxoG DNA glycosylase activity and AP lyase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh863c29">29</xref>), still retained significant binding activity to THF, suggesting that this mutation does not disrupt the recognition&#x0002f;binding mechanism (summarized in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh863tb1">1</xref>). Altogether, our results suggest that Val-317 is crucial for DNA binding activity. However, since the Val-317 mutant protein loses the ability to bind to the substrate in the first place, these analyses do not allow us to speculate whether it is also critical for catalytic activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Quantification of Ogg1 protein level in human mitochondria</title><p>The results above clearly indicate that &#x003b2;-Ogg1 lacks 8-oxoG glycosylase activity, and thus this protein likely does not account for this activity in human mitochondria. We next purified mitochondria from GM1310 cells in order to evaluate the relative levels of Ogg1 isoforms in mitochondria <italic>in vivo</italic>. Before freeze-storage, mitochondria were purified as described in Materials and Methods and treated with Proteinase K to eliminate any cross-contamination of nuclear and cytosolic proteins. Purity of the mitochondrial suspensions was assessed by western blot with the abundant nuclear protein Lamin B1. As shown in Supplementary Figure 3, LaminB1 was readily detected in nuclear extracts but not detected in the mitochondrial fraction. &#x003b2;-Ogg1 protein levels in GM1310 mitochondria were quantified by western blot using polyclonal anti-&#x003b2;-Ogg1 antibody and purified GST-&#x003b2;-Ogg1 as standards (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh863f8">8</xref>A). We estimated that 100 &#x003bc;g GM1310 mitochondria contained 218.5 fmol of &#x003b2;-Ogg1. Nishioka <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh863c26">26</xref>) detected about 5 ng of &#x003b2;-Ogg1 in 100 &#x003bc;g of mitochondria from other human cell lines, corresponding to about 100 fmol &#x003b2;-Ogg1 (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh863tb2">2</xref>). Since &#x003b1;-Ogg1 also contains a mitochondrial localization signal in its N-terminus, we measured &#x003b1;-Ogg1 levels in GM1310 mitochondria by western blot (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh863f8">8</xref>B). Possible nuclear contamination was again assessed and no LaminB1 signal was detected in up to 200 &#x003bc;g of mitochondria. In the blot with anti-Ogg1 polyclonal antibody, we detected a significant signal of &#x0223c;39 kDa protein in the mitochondrial fraction. We also detected a strong signal at &#x0223c;25 kDa in the mitochondrial fraction, which is likely a non-specific cross-reacting band, since there is no report of Ogg1 isoforms of such molecular weight. From those blots, we estimated that mitochondria contain 12.3 fmoles of &#x003b1;-Ogg1 per 100 &#x003bc;g protein.</p><p>To determine the relative distribution of &#x003b1;-Ogg1 between nuclear and mitochondrial compartments, we calculated the ratio of protein content between nuclear and mitochondrial fractions in GM1310 cells, using the ratio of nuclear LaminB over mitochondrial CoxIV from the whole cell extract. The levels of these two proteins were measured in whole cell (25 &#x003bc;g), nuclear (5 &#x003bc;g) and mitochondrial (50 &#x003bc;g) extracts by western blot (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh863tb3">3</xref>). A calculated ratio of 4.2:1 (nuclear:mitochondrial) was obtained. After standardization, we calculated that the semi-quantified amounts of &#x003b1;-Ogg1 were 132.3 and 12.3 fmol in 420 and 100 &#x003bc;g of nucleus and mitochondria, respectively (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh863tb2">2</xref>). This suggests that about 10% of &#x003b1;-Ogg1 localizes to mitochondria.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>We report that recombinant &#x003b2;-Ogg1 does not show 8-oxoG DNA glycosylase activity. Two residues that are not conserved in &#x003b2;-Ogg1, Val-317 and Phe-319, were identified as necessary for DNA binding and 8-oxoG DNA glycosylase activity in &#x003b1;-Ogg1. These results explain the observation that &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup> mitochondria contained only 20% of &#x003b2;-Ogg1 protein compared with WT, despite displaying similar 8-oxoG DNA glycosylase activity. We detected significant levels of &#x003b1;-Ogg1 in human GM1310 mitochondria, implying that this isoform may be responsible for 8-oxoG repair in mitochondria.</p><p>&#x003b2;-Ogg1 has been considered to be the major 8-oxoG DNA glycosylase in human mitochondria since the observation by Nishioka <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh863c26">26</xref>) that it localizes solely to this compartment. While cloning the human Ogg1 gene, Roldan-Arjona and colleagues purified &#x003b2;-Ogg1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh863c25">25</xref>), and in that study, incision activity was detected on an 8-oxoG-containing oligonucleotide. However, those experiments employed very high concentrations of recombinant &#x003b2;-Ogg1 (1 &#x003bc;g, 20 pmol) compared to substrate (75 fmol), resulting in a specific activity of &#x003b2;-Ogg1 that was 100-fold lower than that of Fpg. We did not detect any glycosylase activity of &#x003b2;-Ogg1 in this study under any of the numerous conditions tested (see below). Our experiments with &#x003c1;<sup>0</sup> cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh863f2">2</xref>) showed that &#x003b2;-Ogg1 protein levels can decrease by 80% with no concomitant change in mitochondrial 8-oxoG incision activity. These observations suggest that &#x003b2;-Ogg1 may not be the major mitochondrial 8-oxoG DNA glycosylase. It should also be noted that &#x003b2;-Ogg1 is not present in rat and mouse [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh863c22">22</xref>)]. Using western blot detection of endogenous &#x003b1;- and &#x003b2;-Ogg1 in human GM1310 mitochondria (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh863f8">8</xref>), we detected 12.3 fmol of &#x003b1;-Ogg1 and 218.5 fmol of &#x003b2;-Ogg1 per 100 &#x003bc;g of mitochondria (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh863tb2">2</xref>). Thus, our data suggest that &#x003b1;-Ogg1 performs the 8-oxoG DNA glycosylase activity in human mitochondria. Among rat, mouse and human, the &#x003b1;-isoform of Ogg1 is highly conserved (84% identity in amino acid sequence) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh863c22">22</xref>), underscoring the importance of &#x003b1;-Ogg1 in genomic stability.</p><p>Recombinant &#x003b2;-Ogg1 was expressed and purified with two different fusion epitopes, GST and hexa-histidine, and from an <italic>fpg</italic>-deficient cell line in order to avoid contamination with endogenous <italic>E.coli</italic> Fpg protein. The His-fused &#x003b2;-Ogg1 was also co-expressed with the chaperones, GroEL and GroES, which are bacterial homologues of the human mitochondria chaperones Hsp60 and Hsp10, to facilitate proper protein folding during expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh863c41">41</xref>). To address the possibility that a post-translational modification specific to eukaryotic cells was required for activity, we also purified &#x003b2;-Ogg1 from an insect cell expression system. However, in all cases, no significant 8-oxoG DNA glycosylase activity was detected with recombinant &#x003b2;-Ogg1, although &#x003b1;-Ogg1 expressed in parallel was active under all conditions. The &#x003b2;-Ogg1 also did not display any AP-lyase activity. To investigate the strand scission, after incision reaction, we also stopped the reaction in the presence of NaOH with heat, and no cleaved product was detected (data not shown), suggesting no uncoupled glycosylase activity in &#x003b2;-Ogg1. We therefore conclude that recombinant &#x003b2;-Ogg1 may in fact not have a physiologically significant 8-oxoG DNA glycosylase activity. We have tested a wide range of relevant concentrations, buffers, conditions, and substrates.</p><p>The three-dimensional structure of the catalytic core of human Ogg1 in complex with 8-oxoG containing oligonucleotides has been solved at a resolution of 2.1 &#x0212b; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh863c28">28</xref>). This study revealed that residues Cys-253 and Phe-319 interact with opposite &#x003c0;-faces of 8-oxoG, suggesting that these amino acids form an 8-oxoG recognition pocket. 8-oxoG also forms hydrogen bonds with Gly-42, Gln-315 and two water molecules (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh863f5">5</xref>B). &#x003b2;-Ogg1 lacks the phenylalanine residue at position 319 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh863f5">5</xref>A). We used a site-directed mutagenesis approach to determine how the sequence differences between &#x003b1;- and &#x003b2;-isoforms of Ogg1 affect 8-oxoG recognition and catalysis of its removal.

(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh863c38">38</xref>) reported that a F319A mutant &#x003b1;-Ogg1 lost 8-oxoG incision ability, similar to the F319G mutant we constructed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh863f6">6</xref>C and D). Bacterial AlkA, MutY, Nth and human Ogg1 DNA glycosylases are all members of the endonuclease III family of proteins, with Trp-272 in AlkA, Met-185 in MutY and Ile-180 in Nth DNA glycosylases corresponding to Phe-319 of human Ogg1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh863c42">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh863c44">44</xref>). All these amino acids have hydrophobic side chains, suggesting that hydrophobic interactions are necessary for the formation of &#x003b1;-helix structures and for interactions with lesions in DNA. The absence of this phenylalanine residue in &#x003b2;-Ogg1 suggests that this protein lacks the critical 8-oxoG recognition structure. This conclusion is further supported by the observation that the F319L &#x003b1;-Ogg1 mutant protein lost DNA binding activity, although it retained some DNA glycosylase activity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh863f6">6</xref>C and D). Moreover, the L319F &#x003b2;-Ogg1 mutant protein showed slightly recovered DNA binding activity to 8-oxoG, but no detectable 8-oxoG DNA glycosylase activity. These observations can be reconciled if Phe-319 is critical for 8-oxoG recognition, with other critical amino acid residues present in the C-terminal &#x003b1;O helix playing a more prominent role in the base excision reaction. In this study, we found that the V317G mutant &#x003b1;-Ogg1 also lost DNA glycosylase activity. Val-317 is located in the middle of the &#x003b1;O helix, and its side chain does not face 8-oxoG, whereas the residues Gln-315 and Phe-319 do (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh863f5">5</xref>B). It is likely that Val-317 does not directly interact with 8-oxoG, however, since valine is a hydrophobic amino acid contributing to &#x003b1;-helix stabilization, V317G mutant protein likely causes disruption of the &#x003b1;O helix, preventing correct positioning of the 8-oxoG for Ogg1 activity. As summarized in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh863tb1">1</xref>, our results suggest that stable formation of the &#x003b1;O helix is critical not only for 8-oxoG DNA glycosylase activity but also for DNA binding activity.</p><p>In order to excise 8-oxoG from DNA, Ogg1 is thought to initially bend the DNA at the minor groove of undamaged DNA, searching for modifications that can promote drastic kinking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh863c45">45</xref>). 8-oxoG stimulates the bending of DNA, causing a greater distortion of the DNA double helix structure at the damage site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh863c46">46</xref>). Ogg1 then finds this distortion and likely flips the 8-oxoG residue out, allowing for the interaction of the lesion with a specific pocket in the protein. These interactions then allow the catalytic activity of Ogg1 to take place, cleaving the N-glycosylic bond and releasing 8-oxoG. Norman <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh863c47">47</xref>) investigated the structure of a catalytically inactive Ogg1 mutant (K249Q) with oligonucleotides containing either 8-oxoG or an abasic site analogue (THF) that is not cleaved by Ogg1. They suggested that substrate recognition and catalysis were coupled, observing that the &#x003b1;O-helix slightly shifted away from the active site residue Asp-268. This phenomenon would explain why the F319A mutant retains about 60% of AP lyase activity compared with WT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh863c38">38</xref>) and that the F319L mutant (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh863f6">6</xref>) looses binding activity but retains some 8-oxoG incision activity. Based on these findings, we conclude that &#x003b2;-Ogg1 lacks DNA glycosylase activity because its amino acid sequence does not support the correct assembly of the C-terminal &#x003b1;O helix. Further support for this conclusion comes from the observation that substituting seven amino acids in &#x003b1;-Ogg1 in the &#x003b1;O helix region, positions 317&#x02013;323, with the corresponding sequence in &#x003b2;-Ogg1 (317&#x02013;323&#x0002f;&#x003b1;-&#x003b2; protein, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh863f7">7</xref>) completely abrogates 8-oxoG DNA glycosylase activity.</p><p>In this study, we presented evidence that recombinant &#x003b2;-Ogg1 does not have DNA glycosylase activity due to the lack of the C-terminal &#x003b1;O helix (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh863f7">7</xref>), and &#x003b1;-Ogg1 is present in human mitochondria (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh863f8">8</xref>) and probably accounts for the 8-oxoG incision activity. The question still remains whether &#x003b2;-Ogg1 has glycosylase activity <italic>in vivo</italic>, and if not, what its biological role is. For instance, the possibility exists that &#x003b2;-Ogg1 has repair activities for novel substrates, such as base lesions and RNA substrate, or requires yet unidentified co-factors, including other proteins. It should be noted that &#x003b2;-Ogg1 contains a long tail located in the C-terminus of the protein. This tail was predicted to form a long coiled-coil structure, spanning a transmembrane domain (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh863f5">5</xref>A), which may suggest a role in anchoring the protein in membranous structures. The long tail <italic>per se</italic> did not affect 8-oxoG DNA glycosylase activity as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh863f4">4</xref>. It is also possible that &#x003b2;-Ogg1 participates in another step of base excision repair since it retains the HhH-GPD motif which is highly conserved in EndoIII DNA glycosylase family, and this is currently under investigation. We are now developing &#x003b2;-Ogg1 knock-down and&#x0002f;or over-expressing cell lines to obtain a better understanding of the biological roles of &#x003b2;-Ogg1.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL</title><p>Supplementary Material is available at NAR Online.</p><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Material]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="nar_32_18_5596__index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="nar_32_18_5596__1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkh863f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Structure of the two major human Ogg1 isoforms.
