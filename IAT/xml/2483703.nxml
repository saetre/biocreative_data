CD36 and the related receptor SR-B1 have been localized to caveolae, domains that participate in cell signaling, transcytosis, and regulation of cellular cholesterol homeostasis. Previous work has indicated that the ligand preference of CD36 may depend on the cell type in which it is expressed. To determine if the presence or absence of caveolae is the determining factor for lipoprotein preference, we treated CHO-CD36 and C32 cells with filipin. Filipin treatment rapidly increased the binding capacity of CD36 for the native lipoproteins HDL and LDL, but did not affect the binding capacity of CD36 for oxidized LDL. Filipin treatment affected the distribution of caveolin and CD36 suggesting that the presence caveolae may modulate the ligand preference of CD36. However, its molecular mechanism how CD36 and caveolin interaction in regulating lipoprotein transport remains to be further studied.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Plasma proteins mediate the transport and delivery of lipids. Alterations of the lipoprotein profile present in serum are associated with the incidence of atherosclerosis. In particular, increased production of the oxidized form of the Low Density Lipoprotein (OxLDL), is thought to precede the appearance of the arterial plaques associated with atherosclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Uptake of OxLDL is enhanced in the macrophages present in an arterial plaque and can result in cholesterol accumulation and the formation of foam cells, a process that is thought to be a key event in the development of atherosclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], while oxLDL has been directly implicated in human disease, an understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms that control the uptake and efflux of all the lipoprotein classes and their oxidized products may be central to understanding cholesterol-related diseases.</p><p>Several cell surface glycoproteins, including SR-A, MARCO, CD68, CD36 and SR-B1 are designated as scavenger receptors and contribute to the uptake of modified lipoproteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].

Further studies demonstrated that CD36 expressed in COS 7 or Sf9 cells functioned as a high affinity receptor not only for OxLDL, but also for HDL, LDL and VLDL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Several regions of CD36 have been implicated as binding domains for its different ligands, including amino acids 28&#x02013;93 as the OxLDL binding domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], and amino acids 93&#x02013;120 as the thrombospondin binding region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><p>There is increasing evidence that scavenger receptors play a role in the trafficking of both native and oxidized lipoproteins and that the receptor's membrane microenvironment may play a critical role in its function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] Caveolae are glycosphingolipid and cholesterol-enriched microdomains that contain the scaffolding protein caveolin, receptors, and signaling proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Such membrane microdomains have been implicated in cellular processes such as membrane protein sorting, signal transduction, receptor activation reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] and more recently in cholesterol homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] We have previously demonstrated that the ability of the native lipoproteins HDL and LDL, which are responsible for cholesterol efflux and influx respectively, to inhibit the binding of pRBCs to human CD36 is dependent on the cell type in which the receptor was expressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. In order to test the hypothesis that differential CD36 ligand preference is a result of the receptor's membrane microenvironment, CD36 expressed in sf9 cells (Sf9-CD36), CD36 stably transfected into CHO cells (CHO-CD36), and CD36 endogenously expressed by C32 cells was assayed for its interactions with HDL, LDL and OxLDL. We observed that all three lipoproteins could bind to CD36 expressed in Sf9 cells, however only OxLDL bound to CHO-CD36 and C32 cells. Treatment of CHO-CD36 and C32 cells with filipin, an agent that disrupts caveolae, caused the lipoprotein binding profile of C32 and CHO-CD36 cells to change to that seen in Sf9-CD36 cells. These findings suggest that the binding of native HDL and LDL to CD36 expressed in CHO or C32 cells is normally restricted and HDL and LDL only interact with CD36 when it leaves the environment present in caveolae and enters the general membrane fraction.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Chemicals and reagents</title><p>Grace's insect medium, RPM1 1640, fetal calf serum, geneticin, and trypsin-EDTA were purchased from Gibco BRL (Burlington, ON).

Ten T-75 flasks (Corning, NY) of confluent CHO-CD36 cells were collected by trypsin-EDTA treatment and centrifugation. The cells were then resuspended with 1 ml of Buffer A (0.25 M sucrose, 1 mM EDTA, 20 mM Tricine, pH7.8).

This conclusion may reconcile why CD36 was originally identified as a receptor for oxLDL, but not native HDL or LDL or acetyl LDL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>] when CD36 was expressed in 293 cells, but that recent studies using CD36 transfected Sf9 and COS-7 cells have indicated that native HDL, LDL, VLDL, as well as OxLDL all bind with high affinity to CD36 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. It is also consistent with the observation that the interaction of <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>-infected erythrocytes with CD36 is inhibited by some ligands (i.e. pRBCs and oxLDL) in all cell types, while inhibition with other ligands (i.e. LDL and HDL) were dependent on the expression system used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p><p>Our initial experiments confirmed and extended the binding studies of Calvo et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and focused on ensuring that the ligand preference of CD36 expressed in Sf9 cells, CHO cells and C32 cells was, as we and others, have described it (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). We are confident that the majority of the lipoprotein binding observed with Sf9 and CHO cells is due to the CD36 receptor that has been introduced into these cell lines since mock (either baculovirus control or vector only) cell line controls show minimal amounts of lipoprotein binding. A similar control cell line is not available for C32 cells, however: 1) the staining pattern of these cells strongly resembles that seen in CHO-CD36 cells; and 2) C32 cells support pRBC adherence in the presence of native lipoproteins, which suggests that unoxidized lipoproteins do not compete for CD36 in this system. We therefore conclude that C32 cells may reflect the ligand preferences of CD36 in vivo.</p><p>We have previously speculated that expressing human CD36 in several different cell types could lead to a common amino acid sequence but with cell type specific gylcosylation states or covalent modifications and that these may determine ligand preference. While we cannot rule out this possibility, the effect of filipin, which modifies the properties of the lipid membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>], strongly suggests that differences in native lipoprotein ligand preference do not result from covalent modification alone. Similarly, the relatively short time required to alter the ligand preference of the CHO CD36 and C32 cells suggests that alterations of the amount or structure of the receptor because of altered synthesis rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] are not involved. Filipin is able to bind to and remove cholesterol from mammalian membranes, particularly from the cholesterol enriched segments that form invaginated regions of the membrane responsible for endocytosis, mechanotransduction, signaling, cholesterol exchange [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>] and the induction of apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>].</p><p>While our results confirmed that CD36 was colocalized with the protein marker of caveolae, caveolin-1, which suggested that the entry and exit of CD36 into caveolae may function as a mechanism to control the cholesterol content of a cell. Caveolae are cell surface plasma membrane invaginations observed in different type of cells and their protein marker caveolin-1 has been implicated in the development of an atheroma and involved in regulating several signal transduction pathways and processes that play an important role in atherosclerosis[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. Fielding et al (1997, 1995) have also observed that caveolae are clathrin-free cell-surface organelles implicated in transmembrane transport. When 3H-labeled free cholesterol was selectively transferred to the cells from labeled low density lipoprotein to increase cell free cholesterol approximately 15%, there was a 6-fold increase in label in the caveolar fraction above baseline levels. When okadaic acid was used, it decreased cholesterol efflux, which indicate that caveolae represent a major site of efflux of both newly synthesized and low density lipoprotein-derived free cholesterol in cells[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. In our study, the lipoprotein binging profile of in CHO-CD36 cells was altered by filipin treatment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) and the filipin treatment could alter the redistribution of CD36 molecules in caveolae into cytoplasm.Gaus et al.(2005) demonstrated that the caveolae proteins in the depleted membrane are affected differently by detergents and the depletion of chlosterol severely alters lipid raft structure, causing the dipersal of caveolar raft-assiciated proteins into non- raft domains of the plasma membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>] However, its molecular mechanism how CD36 and caveolin interaction in regulating lipoprotein transport remains to be further studied.</p><p>Filipin treatment of CHO-CD36 cells appeared to have little effect on the capacity of CD36 to interact with oxLDL (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) or pRBC (data not shown). This may appear to contradict the findings of Frank et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>] that treatment of macrophages with cyclodextran reduces oxLDL uptake, however these results were obtained after a much longer treatment period (16 hr) and were found to be due to the regulation of CD36 expression. Short term treatments produced a translocation of CD36 accompanied by a change in the surface distribution of CD36 and an increase in the staining intensity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. Similar results were obtained with C32 cells and therefore we expect that sequestration of CD36 in caveolae may be a physiologically relevant short term mechanism of lipid traffic control. Further studies are needed to determine the specific binding sites of CD36 on caveolin molecules and their signal regulation pathways, which may provide a pathological implication in lipid-related diseases.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>HDL: High Density Lipoprotein; HEPES: 4-(2-Hydroxyethyl)-1-Piperazineethane Sulfonic acid; LDL: Low Densivity Lipoprotein; MARCO: Microphage Receptor with Collagenous Domain; oxLDL: oxidized LDL; PRBCs: Plasmodium falciparum-infected lood cells; SR-B1: Scavenger Receptor B1; VLDL: Very Low Density Lipoprotein.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>JZ performed all of the experiements and data analysis, and drafted the manuscript, WC carried out data analysis, figure formatting and manuscript proofreading, IC conceived of the study, and participated in its design and experimental instruction and the manuscript preparation.
