We demonstrate that the fission yeast protein Epe1 stabilises silent chromatin, preventing the oscillation of heterochromatin domains. Epe1 loss leads to two contrasting phenotypes: alleviation of silencing within heterochromatin and expansion of silent chromatin into neighbouring euchromatin. Thus, we propose that Epe1 regulates heterochromatin assembly and disassembly, thereby affecting heterochromatin integrity, centromere function and chromosome segregation fidelity. Epe1 regulates the extent of heterochromatin domains at the level of chromatin, not via the RNAi pathway. Analysis of an ectopically silenced site suggests that heterochromatin oscillation occurs in the absence of heterochromatin boundaries. Epe1 requires predicted iron- and 2-oxyglutarate (2-OG)-binding residues for <italic>in vivo</italic> function, indicating that it is probably a 2-OG/Fe(II)-dependent dioxygenase. We suggest that, rather than being a histone demethylase, Epe1 may be a protein hydroxylase that affects the stability of a heterochromatin protein, or protein&#x02013;protein interaction, to regulate the extent of heterochromatin domains. Thus, Epe1 ensures that heterochromatin is restricted to the domains to which it is targeted by RNAi.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>centromere</kwd><kwd>Epe1</kwd><kwd>fission yeast</kwd><kwd>heterochromatin</kwd><kwd>JmjC domain</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec disp-level="1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Heterochromatin is a conserved feature of eukaryotic chromosomes and plays an important role in chromosome segregation, genomic stability and gene regulation. In the fisson yeast <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>, heterochromatin is formed at centromeres, telomeres and the mating-type (<italic>mat</italic>) locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Verdel and Moazed, 2005</xref>). Centromeres are composed of a central domain (<italic>cnt</italic>), which has a specialised chromatin structure associated with the histone H3 variant Cnp1/CENP-A, flanked by heterochromatic outer repeats (<italic>otr</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Pidoux and Allshire, 2004</xref>). At centromeres, tRNA genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Scott <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>) and the IRCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Cam <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>) have been implicated in confining heterochromatin. At the mating-type locus, the <italic>mat2</italic> and <italic>mat3</italic> silent donor loci and the K region are packaged into heterochromatin constrained by the IR-R and IR-L barrier elements which recruit TFIIIC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Noma <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Thon <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>).</p><p>In regions of silent chromatin, histones are generally underacetylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Ekwall <italic>et al</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Mellone <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>) and are methylated at lysine 9 of histone H3 (H3K9me) by the histone methyltransferase (HMTase) Clr4, a member of the highly conserved Suv39 family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Rea <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>). The H3K9 methylation is a binding site for the chromodomain proteins: Swi6, Chp1 and Chp2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Ekwall <italic>et al</italic>, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Bannister <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Nakayama <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Sadaie <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>).</p><p>Transcription of the outer repeats by RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) generates noncoding RNA transcripts that are processed into small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) by the RNaseIII-like ribonuclease Dicer (Dcr1). siRNAs associate with the RNA-induced Initiation of Transcriptional Silencing (RITS) complex, which consists of Chp1, Argonaute (Ago1) and Tas3. The RITS complex uses the siRNAs to target it to homologous chromatin for silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Motamedi <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Noma <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Verdel <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>). Mutants in RNAi pathway proteins such as <italic>dcr1</italic>&#x00394;<italic>, ago1</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>rpb2</italic>, the second largest subunit of RNA polymerase II, lose centromeric silencing (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Verdel and Moazed, 2005</xref>). However, RNAi is dispensable for the maintenance of heterochromatin at the <italic>mat</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Jia <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Kim <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>).</p><p>Previously, we proposed that <italic>S. pombe</italic> protein Epe1 and other members of the JmjC domain family are 2-OG/Fe(II)-dependent dioxygenases that may act as histone demethylases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Trewick <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). Recently, several JmjC domain proteins have been demonstrated to have this activity (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Klose <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). Epe1 is distributed across all the major heterochromatic domains and certain meiotic genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Zofall and Grewal, 2006</xref>). The observation that Epe1 blocks heterochromatin from forming beyond the IR-L barrier at the <italic>mat</italic> locus lead to the proposal that Epe1 is a negative regulator of heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Ayoub <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>). Loss of Epe1 leads to the downregulation of genes that are known to be upregulated in cells with defective silent chromatin, suggesting that Epe1 counteracts silencing of repressed genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Isaac <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). It has also been suggested that Epe1 directly facilitates the access of RNAPII to centromeric repeats and that Epe1 has a role at heterochromatin boundaries by facilitating transcription of the IRC boundary elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Zofall and Grewal, 2006</xref>).</p><p>Here we show that contrary to previous reports, predicted Fe(II)- and 2-OG-binding residues are required for Epe1 function, suggesting that Epe1 is a 2-OG/Fe(II)-dependent dioxygenase. We also demonstrate that Epe1 acts at the chromatin level to prevent heterochromatin domains from both expanding and contracting.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Epe1 restrains heterochromatin to its normal domain</title><p>We initially identified Epe1 as an Swi6 interacting protein in a yeast two-hybrid screen. The Epe1 cDNA obtained corresponded to the region spanning from amino acid 652 to the C-terminus, indicating that the region containing the JmjC domain of Epe1 is not required for the interaction with Swi6 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 1A</xref>). Consistent with this and the observations of others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Zofall and Grewal, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Isaac <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>), GFP-tagged Epe1 was found to colocalise with Swi6 at heterochromatin. This localisation is dependent on Swi6, Clr4 and Rik1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p>As Epe1 is localised to heterochromatin, we investigated its role in heterochromatin stability using marker genes inserted within and outside centromeric heterochromatin at centromere 1 (<italic>cen1</italic>). Genes placed within the centromeres are transcriptionally silenced due to the formation of H3K9 methylation/Swi6-dependent heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Allshire <italic>et al</italic>, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Grewal and Klar, 1996</xref>). In the case of the <italic>ura4</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> marker gene, this silencing results in restricted growth on selective plates that lack uracil (&#x02212;URA) and good growth on counter-selective plates that contain 5-fluoroorotic acid (FOA). Genes inserted in the distal extremity of <italic>cen1</italic> are less silent (sites 3 and 4: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Allshire <italic>et al</italic>, 1995</xref>) and genes inserted in the euchromatin immediately adjacent to <italic>cen1</italic> are expressed well (sites 1 and 2: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A</xref>). Deletion of the gene encoding Epe1 (<italic>epe1</italic>&#x00394;) results in enhanced silencing of markers inserted at the extremities of the <italic>cen1</italic> outer repeat (sites 3 and 4), indicated by increased growth on FOA. In addition, loss of Epe1 causes significant silencing of the normally fully expressed marker genes in adjacent euchromatin (sites 1 and 2; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1B</xref>). Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis was performed to examine the level of H3K9me2, a well-characterised histone modification associated with silent chromatin. In <italic>epe1</italic>&#x00394; cells, high levels of H3K9me2 are found at the normally euchromatic region outside of the centromere (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1C</xref>). This agrees with previous observations showing that in <italic>epe1</italic>&#x00394; cells, silent chromatin extends into nearby euchromatic regions and results in gene silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Ayoub <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Zofall and Grewal, 2006</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Epe1 is required for centromeric heterochromatin integrity</title><p>Loss of Epe1 promotes spreading of silent chromatin from heterochromatin domains into euchromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Ayoub <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Zofall and Grewal, 2006</xref>). However, the effect of <italic>epe1</italic>&#x00394; on heterochromatin integrity has not been tested. To address this, we examined the effect of the <italic>epe1</italic>&#x00394; mutation on silencing of an <italic>ade6</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> gene inserted within the centromeric outer repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2A</xref>). In wild-type cells, this <italic>ade6</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> gene (<italic>cen1-otr1R(Sph</italic>I<italic>):ade6</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup>) is strongly repressed, resulting in the formation of red colonies on plates with limiting adenine, due to the accumulation of a red adenine precursor. Conversely, <italic>clr4</italic>&#x00394; cells that lack the histone H3K9 methyltransferase are unable to assemble heterochromatin, resulting in full expression of the <italic>ade6</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> marker and the formation of white colonies. Unusually, <italic>epe1</italic>&#x00394; colonies exhibit variegation, resulting in white, pink and red colonies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2B</xref>). The state of silencing of <italic>cen1-otr1:ade6</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> switches frequently in an <italic>epe1</italic>&#x00394; population, so that when white colonies are replated they often give rise to red and pink colonies and <italic>vice versa</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). Thus, although these <italic>epe1</italic>&#x00394; isolates are genetically identical, they display distinct metastable silent and expressed states, which must reflect epigenetic differences in centromeric heterochromatin integrity.</p><p>We also tested whether loss of Epe1 affects silencing of a <italic>ura4</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> gene located within centromeric heterochromatin (<italic>cen1-imr1L(Nco</italic>I<italic>):ura4</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2A</xref>). In wild-type strains, this <italic>ura4</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> gene is strongly silenced, allowing good growth on FOA and low levels of growth on media lacking uracil. In contrast, the silencing in <italic>epe1</italic>&#x00394; cells variegates (data not shown). Colonies with the <italic>ura4</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> gene in the transcriptionally silent or active states were picked from FOA or &#x02212;URA plates and their ability to grow was assessed when challenged with selective (&#x02212;URA) or counter selective (FOA) medium. <italic>epe1</italic>&#x00394; colonies expressing the <italic>ura4</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> gene (from &#x02212;URA plates) were consistently able to sustain this active state, allowing better growth on &#x02212;URA plates than similarly preselected wild-type colonies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2C</xref>). In reciprocal experiments, FOA-resistant <italic>epe1</italic>&#x00394; cells selected for silencing of <italic>imr1L(Nco</italic>I<italic>):ura4</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> gene (from FOA plates) were less capable than wild type in sustaining this repressed state resulting in more growth on &#x02212;URA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2C</xref>). Together, this indicates that silent chromatin at centromeres is less stable in the absence of Epe1.</p><p>We show that loss of Epe1 causes not only spreading of heterochromatin into euchromatic regions, but also the destabilisation of heterochromatin within the centromere. The destabilisation of silencing observed in the absence of Epe1 is inconsistent with the previously proposed role for Epe1 as a factor that acts to prevent heterochromatin spreading past specific boundary elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Ayoub <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Zofall and Grewal, 2006</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Epe1 is required for normal centromere function</title><p>It is well established that mutants with defective centromeric heterochromatin, such as <italic>swi6</italic>&#x00394;, <italic>clr4</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>rik1</italic>&#x00394;, have chromosome segregation defects; they display lagging chromosomes on late anaphase spindles and are sensitive to microtubule-destabilising drug thiabendazole (TBZ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Ekwall <italic>et al</italic>, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Ekwall <italic>et al</italic>, 1996</xref>). If loss of Epe1 leads to disruption of heterochromatin, then <italic>epe1</italic>&#x00394; cells would be expected to display similar chromosome segregation defects. <italic>epe1</italic>&#x00394; colonies in which <italic>cen1-otr1(Sph</italic>I<italic>):ade6</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> was silent (red) or expressed (white) were replated in a serial dilution assay on plates containing 15 &#x003bc;g/ml TBZ.

This indicates that TBZ sensitivity covariegates with the silent/expressed state, implying that cells with less intact silent chromatin are more prone to chromosome mis-segregation events.</p><p><italic>epe1</italic>&#x00394; cells exhibit lagging chromosomes at an elevated frequency compared to wild-type cells. A higher incidence of lagging chromosomes was observed in cultures derived from white <italic>otr1(Sph</italic>I<italic>):ade6</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> colonies than their genetically identical red/pink relatives (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2E</xref>). This indicates that the white-expressed state caused by loss of Epe1 is incompatible with normal chromosome segregation and is consistent with Epe1 being required for centromeric heterochromatin integrity and centromere function. Therefore, white <italic>epe1</italic>&#x00394; colonies, in a manner similar to <italic>swi6</italic>&#x00394; cells, exhibit defective centromeric heterochromatin, which results in loss of silencing, lagging chromosomes and TBZ sensitivity.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Loss of Epe1 causes heterochromatin to oscillate</title><p>Epe1 is required to restrict domains of heterochromatin, and in its absence heterochromatin spreads into surrounding euchromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Ayoub <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Zofall and Grewal, 2006</xref>). However, contrary to this, our analysis demonstrates that Epe1 is required for normal heterochromatin integrity since loss of Epe1 destabilises silencing at centromeres and causes chromosome segregation defects. It is surprising that these seemingly opposing effects could be caused by absence of the same protein. A possible explanation for this phenotype is that expansion of a silent domain disrupts silencing at more internal sites, perhaps by titrating away essential components of heterochromatin. An alternative explanation is that in the absence of Epe1, the silent chromatin domains oscillate, either expanding into euchromatin or retreating to allow alleviation of silencing.</p><p>To address these possibilities, a strain was constructed with a <italic>ura4</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> in a normally nonsilent euchromatic site (<italic>otr1R</italic>(<italic>Xho</italic>I):<italic>ura4</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup>) and, on the same side of the centromere, an <italic>ade6</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> gene within the silent <italic>otr</italic> region (<italic>otr1R(Sph</italic>I<italic>):ade6</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3A</xref>). Wild-type cells silence the centromeric <italic>ade6</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> gene, forming red colonies and express the euchromatic <italic>ura4</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> gene. Some <italic>epe1</italic>&#x00394; colonies form an extended heterochromatin domain, silencing the euchromatic <italic>ura4</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> gene (FOA<sup>R</sup> colonies). The majority of these <italic>epe1</italic>&#x00394; colonies are red or pink (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3A</xref>), indicating that in the absence of Epe1 centromeric heterochromatin is not disrupted when silent chromatin extends into neighbouring euchromatin.</p><p>Also, when centromeric heterochromatin is disrupted in <italic>epe1</italic>&#x00394; cells, silencing does not spread into the euchromatin. This is demonstrated by white (<italic>cen1-otr1</italic>:<italic>ade6</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> expressing) <italic>epe1</italic>&#x00394; cells which when replated showed good expression of the euchromatic <italic>ura4</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> gene (poor growth on FOA). However, occasionally, white <italic>epe1</italic>&#x00394; colonies with disrupted centromeric silencing gave rise to a few colonies on FOA plates, however, these were red/pink rather than white. This again indicates that in <italic>epe1</italic>&#x00394; cells, repression of <italic>ura4</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> outside the normal silent domain requires silencing to be intact in the adjacent outer repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3A</xref>).</p><p>A similar experiment was performed with a strain in which the <italic>ura4</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> gene was inserted at the equivalent position in the euchromatin on the opposite side of the centromere to the <italic>ade6</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> marker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3B</xref>). Again, when <italic>epe1</italic>&#x00394; cells were plated on FOA to select colonies in which heterochromatin has spread over the <italic>ura4</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> gene, the colonies formed were red or pink, indicating that <italic>ade6</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> is repressed on the other side of the centromere (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3B</xref>). Therefore, silencing must be maintained across the outer repeats on the left-hand side of the centromere to allow the expansion of the heterochromatin domain on the right-hand side.</p><p>Together, these data indicate that in <italic>epe1</italic>&#x00394; cells the spreading of heterochromatin beyond the normal centromeric domain does not destabilise silent chromatin within the centromere. It also indicates that <italic>epe1</italic>&#x00394; mutants require intact heterochromatin on both left and right centromeric <italic>otr</italic> repeats in order to form an extended heterochromatin domain. Therefore, loss of Epe1 leads to a more erratic form of silent chromatin, allowing heterochromatin to oscillate, retreating or extending over greater distances than observed in the wild-type cells.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Heterochromatin expansion occurs independently of boundaries in epe1<italic>&#x00394;</italic> cells</title><p>Epe1 has been proposed to act at boundaries because peaks of Epe1 localisation have been found to coincide with, and promote the transcription of IRC elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Zofall and Grewal, 2006</xref>). Moreover, IRC elements have been demonstrated to act as boundary elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Noma <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). However, if Epe1 functions only at boundary elements, loss of Epe1 would be expected to have no effect on an ectopically silenced locus where no known boundary elements are present. The ectopic silencer strain contains a 1.6 kb fragment from the outer repeat of centromere 3 (L5) inserted at the <italic>ade6</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4A</xref>) and has been shown to efficiently silence an adjacent <italic>ura4</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> marker gene but not the <italic>ade6</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> gene 1.3 kb downstream of the <italic>ura4</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> ORF. H3K9me2, Swi6 and Chp1 are associated with this ectopically silenced <italic>ura4</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and this silencing is dependent on RNAi and heterochromatin components. Thus, the silent chromatin formed at this ectopic site (<italic>ade6</italic>:L5-<italic>ura4</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup>) is indistinguishable from that found at the centromeric repeats themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Partridge <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Volpe <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>). In wild-type strains, silencing of this <italic>ade6:L5-ura4</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> reporter allows good growth on FOA relative to &#x02212;URA plates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4A</xref>).

An alternative possibility is that Epe1 acts independently of RNAi and functions at the chromatin level, for example by directly modifying a heterochromatin factor. To determine if Epe1 resides in the RNAi pathway, we examined hallmark criteria that distinguish between RNAi factors and heterochromatin factors.

Therefore, in the absence of Epe1, heterochromatin spreads along the centromeric repeats even without intact RNAi. Previous analyses have demonstrated that a moderate level of H3K9me2 methylation persists in an RNAi-deficient background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Sadaie <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>). The most plausible explanation for our observations is that in the absence of Epe1, silent chromatin can extend outwards using this residual H3K9 methylation as a nucleation point for the expansion of silent chromatin along the chromatin fibre without RNAi components or siRNAs.</p><p>We next examined centromeric heterochromatin formed in <italic>epe1</italic>&#x00394;<italic>, dcr1</italic>&#x00394; and an <italic>epe1</italic>&#x00394;<italic>dcr1</italic>&#x00394; double mutant.

To determine if Epe1 affects or is required for the production of these noncoding centromeric RNAs, transcript levels were assessed by Northern blot and RT&#x02013;PCR. As expected, the level of centromeric transcript in the wild type is low, but transcripts accumulate in <italic>dcr1</italic>&#x00394; cells. We observe that in <italic>epe1</italic>&#x00394;<italic>dcr1</italic>&#x00394; double mutants, the levels of transcript observed are significantly reduced compared to that of the <italic>dcr1</italic>&#x00394; background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6A</xref>).

However, in <italic>epe1</italic>&#x00394;<italic>dcr1</italic>&#x00394; cells (and also in <italic>epe1</italic>&#x00394;), the levels of centromeric transcript detected are inversely correlated with the level of phenotypic silencing.

This suggests that in <italic>epe1</italic>&#x00394; cells, the stochastic loss and formation of heterochromatin over the centromeric repeats (and the transcript promoters) regulates the amount of centromeric transcription. Therefore, the overall reduction in centromeric transcript detected in <italic>epe1</italic>&#x00394;<italic>dcr1</italic>&#x00394; cells is caused by loss of regulation of heterochromatin. This suggests that the effect Epe1 has on centromeric transcription is indirect and provides an alternative explanation for the reduced levels of RNAPII associated with the heterochromatic repeats and IRC elements observed in <italic>epe1</italic>&#x00394; cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Zofall and Grewal, 2006</xref>).</p><p>Consistent with a misregulation of heterochromatin in <italic>epe1</italic> mutants causing reduced centromere repeat transcription, Northern analyses of siRNAs homologous to centromeric <italic>dh</italic> repeats revealed that siRNAs levels are variable but lower in <italic>epe1</italic>&#x00394; cells compared to the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6C</xref>). siRNA levels do not cause the variegation in silencing as siRNA levels are not higher in cells with extended heterochromatin domains, than in cells with disrupted heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 5</xref>). Also, the low level of siRNAs is not the cause of the disruption of silencing, because <italic>epe1</italic>&#x00394; cells have defective silencing at the <italic>mat</italic> locus where siRNAs are not required to maintain silencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4C</xref>). Therefore, since we have demonstrated that in <italic>epe1</italic>&#x00394; cells the expansion and disruption of heterochromatin is independent of the RNAi pathway, the erratic behaviour of heterochromatin observed must be due to defective regulation of heterochromatin rather than reduced siRNA levels.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Epe1 requires iron- and 2-OG-binding residues for activity</title><p>Previously, we demonstrated that the JmjC domain of Epe1 can be modelled on the structure of FIH (Factor inhibiting HIF&#x003b1;) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Trewick <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>).

Epe1 contains a variant of this motif in which the second histidine is replaced with tyrosine (HXEX<sub>70</sub>Y), therefore, we predicted that Epe1 coordinates Fe(II) with the residues H297, E299 and Y370. The structural model also suggested that Epe1 would interact with its co-substrate 2-OG via K314 along with two additional amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Trewick <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>).</p><p>More recently it has been suggested that Epe1 is not an active dioxygenase enzyme.

Overexpression of either wild-type protein or Epe1 mutated in a predicted Fe(II)-binding residue causes the disruption of centromeric heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Zofall and Grewal, 2006</xref>). This suggested that the critical H297 residue, predicted to bind Fe(II), is dispensable for Epe1 function. However, this interpretation neglects the possibility that the defective silencing observed is due to Epe1 overexpression rather than Epe1 activity.</p><p>To investigate further, wild-type Epe1 and the mutant proteins Epe1-H297A and Epe1-K314A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7A</xref>), with defective Fe(II)-binding and 2-OG-interacting residues, respectively, were overexpressed from the <italic>nmt41</italic> promoter on a high copy plasmid. The Epe1-H297A and Epe1-K314A proteins are stable and expressed at a similar level to the wild-type Epe1 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7E</xref>). Overexpression of the wild-type Epe1, Epe1-H297A or Epe1-K314A in a strain containing the normally strongly repressed <italic>cen1-otr1R(Sph</italic>I<italic>):ade6</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> marker, alleviated silencing, so that mainly white colonies were formed compared with the red colonies formed with the empty plasmid control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7C</xref>). Similarly, in a strain bearing <italic>otr1R(Sph</italic>I<italic>):ura4</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, overexpression of wild-type or the Epe1 point mutants resulted in the majority of colonies exhibiting increased growth on &#x02212;URA plates, consistent with defective centromeric heterochromatin formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7D</xref>). Therefore, the H297 and K314 residues are not required for the disruption of silencing observed when Epe1 is overexpressed.</p><p>However, to determine if these critical residues are really required for Epe1 function, the same H297A and K314A alterations were made in the open reading frame of endogenous <italic>epe1</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> gene expressed from its native promoter. Interestingly, the <italic>epe1-H297A</italic> and <italic>epe1-K314A</italic> mutants have phenotypes that are indistinguishable from <italic>epe1</italic>&#x00394;. Like <italic>epe1</italic>&#x00394; cells, both <italic>epe1-H297A</italic> and <italic>epe1-K314A</italic> cells exhibit variegated expression of <italic>cen1-otr1R(Sph</italic>I<italic>):ade6</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, resulting in red, pink and white colonies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7F</xref>). Moreover, <italic>epe1-H297A</italic> and <italic>epe1-K314A</italic> cells have extended centromeric chromatin domains, H3K9me2 can spread from the centromere (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 6</xref>) resulting in silencing of a <italic>ura4</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> marker gene located in a normally expressed euchromatic site as indicated by increased growth on FOA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7G</xref>). These analyses clearly demonstrate that the <italic>in vivo</italic> activity of the Epe1 protein is abolished by the H297A and K314A mutations. This indicates that the predicted Fe(II)-binding and 2-OG-interacting residues are essential for Epe1 function. Furthermore, this is consistent with Epe1 being an active enzyme of the 2-OG/Fe(II)-dependent dioxygenase superfamily. The disruption of silencing observed when Epe1 is overexpressed is therefore not due to the enzymatic activity of Epe1. These analyses contradict previous reports that suggested that these residues are not important for Epe1 function and that Epe1 is not a 2-OG/Fe(II)-dependent dioxygenase.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here we have demonstrated that Epe1 regulates the stability of heterochromatin domains.

These silent and expressed states are metastable (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). We propose that in <italic>epe1</italic>&#x00394; cells, silent chromatin domains oscillate, expanding into the surrounding euchromatin or contracting to cause alleviation of silencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>We suggest that Epe1 acts directly to prevent the oscillation of heterochromatin domains rather than via boundary elements. Although Epe1 may have a specific role at heterochromatin boundaries, our data plainly demonstrates that Epe1 stabilises heterochromatin in the absence of known boundary elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">5D</xref>).</p><p>Epe1 could either act in the RNAi pathway or at the chromatin level to regulate the stability of heterochromatin domains. Our analyses show that Epe1 is not a component of the RNAi pathway and therefore must function at the chromatin level. Unlike RNAi factors, Epe1 is not required for the establishment of centromeric heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 3</xref>). Also, loss of Epe1 causes variegated silencing at the <italic>mat</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4C</xref>), where RNAi is dispensable for maintenance of heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Hall <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>). In fact, in <italic>epe1</italic>&#x00394; cells, heterochromatin can spread independently of RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5</xref>). We postulate that residual pockets of H3K9me2 that remain in RNAi mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Sadaie <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>) may act as nucleation sites from which, in the absence of Epe1, heterochromatin can spread. Therefore, the erratic behaviour of heterochromatin observed is due to aberrant regulation of heterochromatin rather than by an RNAi defect. Our data suggest that Epe1 does not regulate RNAPII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Zofall and Grewal, 2006</xref>), but that Epe1 regulates the integrity of heterochromatin and therefore indirectly effects access of RNAPII to centromeric chromatin.</p><p>Heterochromatin may spread along fibres in a transcription/RNAi-coupled manner. Or, in an alternative model, spreading might be caused by the polymerisation of chromatin factors in a step-wise fashion, for example, a nucleation site of Swi6, bound to H3K9me2, could recruit a histone deacetylase and Clr4, allowing H3K9 methylation of adjacent nucleosomes and binding of additional Swi6 (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Talbert and Henikoff, 2006</xref>). Our results demonstrate that in the absence of Epe1, heterochromatin can spread or collapse without active RNAi, therefore, suggesting that Epe1 may prevent heterochromatin from spreading and collapsing via the step-wise assembly mechanism. We propose that Epe1 dampens the natural tendency of silent chromatin to assemble or disassemble. Thus, in the absence of Epe1, minor fluctuations in the extent of silent chromatin domains remain unchecked and the process is unregulated, resulting in frequent expansion&#x02013;contraction of the silent domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><p>Epe1 is likely to be an active 2-OG/Fe(II)-dependent dioxygenase. Contrary to other reports, we have demonstrated that a predicted iron-binding residue (H297) and 2-OG-binding residue (K314) are essential for the <italic>in vivo</italic> activity of Epe1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7</xref>). However, no histone demethylase activity can be detected <italic>in vitro</italic> for Epe1 (unpublished observation; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Tsukada <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Zofall and Grewal, 2006</xref>). Although Epe1 could be a histone demethylase, the lack of <italic>in vitro</italic> activity leads us to propose an alternative mechanism for Epe1. It is possible that Epe1 acts analogously to another JmjC domain protein, FIH, to which Epe1 has strong structural homology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Trewick <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). FIH is a protein hydroxylase that hydroxylates Asn803 of HIF and prevents it binding to the histone acetylase p300 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Schofield and Ratcliffe, 2005</xref>). We propose that Epe1 could be a protein hydroxylase that affects the stability of a heterochromatin protein, or protein&#x02013;protein interaction, to regulate the extent and stability of heterochromatin domains. Hydroxylation of a heterochromatin factor could regulate the stability of silent chromatin, effectively buffering the extent of heterochromatin formed adjacent to a nucleation site. There are many potential substrates for Epe1. As Epe1 interacts with Swi6 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Zofall and Grewal, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Isaac <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>), it is possible that Epe1 hydroxylates Swi6. However, it is equally possible that Epe1 prevents silent chromatin from oscillating by hydroxylating other components of silent chromatin. For example, Epe1 could directly regulate the activity or stability of the Clr4 methyltransferase, histone deacetylases or another heterochromatin protein.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Fission yeast strains and genetic methods</title><p>The media and standard genetic procedures used were described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Moreno <italic>et al</italic>, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Allshire <italic>et al</italic>, 1994</xref>).

For H3K9me2 ChIP, cells were fixed with 1&#x00025; PFA for 15 min at room temperature. Cells were lysed using a bead beater (Biospec products) and sonicated using a Bioruptor (Diagenode) sonicator for a total of 15 min (30 s ON and OFF cycle). Monoclonal H3K9me2 antibody (1 &#x003bc;l) was used per ChIP. Multiplex PCR products were separated on 1.7&#x00025; agarose gels and post-stained with ethidium bromide.

The aqueous phase was chloroform extracted and the RNA ethanol precipitated. The RT&#x02013;PCR was performed using SuperScript III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen). For northern blots, RNA was extracted by resuspending cells in 50 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl pH 7.5, 10 mM EDTA pH 8, 100 mM NaCl, 1&#x00025; SDS, lysing by the addition of phenol:chloroform 5:1, acid washed beads and vortexing for 30 min at 4&#x000b0;C. The soluble fraction was extracted with phenol/chloroform and ethanol precipitated. Centromeric transcripts were precipitated with 10&#x00025; polyethylene glycol 8000 and 0.5 M NaCl on ice for 30 min followed by centrifugation. siRNAs were precipitated by addition of ethanol and sodium acetate and incubation at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C for 3 h. Transcripts were run on a 1&#x00025; agarose 6&#x00025; formaldehyde gel. siRNA samples were run on an 8&#x00025; polyacrylamide gel. To check for loading, siRNA gels were cut above the xylene cyanol band and stained with ethidium bromide. siRNA and transcript gels were blotted by capillary transfer onto Hybond-NX (Amersham) and UV crosslinked. Transcript gels were probed with a <sup>32</sup>P-labelled PCR product homologous to the <italic>dg</italic> centromeric repeats. siRNA gels were probed with a PCR product homologous to the <italic>dh</italic> repeats, and as a loading control an oligonucleotide homologous to a snoRNA.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Construction of plasmid mutants</title><p>Epe1 was cloned into the pDONR201 entry plasmid (Invitrogen).
