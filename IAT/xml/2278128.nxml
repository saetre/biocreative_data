Although successful production of animal clones from somatic cells has been achieved in various species, many problems in offspring could not be hurdled due to incomplete nuclear reprogramming [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Cross-species nuclear transfer involves transferring cell nuclei of one species into enucleated oocytes of another species, which has been shown to be a potent approach to retain the genetic viability of a certain species near extinction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. However, most embryos produced by cross-species nuclear transfer were compromised because they were unable to develop to later developmental stages. To study inefficient reprogramming of the donor nuclei in the recipient cytoplasm from another species, nuclear transfer (NT) between two fish species was used as a model in the present study. A pioneering study on fish NT was carried out by Tung et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] and extensive studies on fish cross-species NT were mainly conducted in <italic>Cyprinid </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Recently, cross-genus cloned fish derived from transgenic common carp nuclei and goldfish enucleated eggs were generated and the somitogenesis and vertebral number of the cloned fish were consistent to the egg-providing species, goldfish (<italic>Carassius auratus</italic>), instead of the donor cell species, common carp (<italic>Cyprinus carpio</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Gene expression analysis of cross-species cloned embryos will shed light on the regulatory mechanisms involved in cross-species nuclear transfer and embryonic development.</p><p>Nuclear transfer between two laboratory fish species, rare minnow (<italic>Gobiocypris rarus</italic>) and zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>), provides an ideal model for the study of cross-species nuclear transfer. Rare minnow and zebrafish belong to different subfamily &#x02013; the <italic>Gobioninae </italic>and the <italic>Danioninae </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].

Rare minnow, a special local species in China, not only shares aforementioned advantages with zebrafish, but also has many unique traits for laboratory study such as typical eurytherm and high adaptation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], and sensitivity to toxicity and virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Such advantages enable rare minnow to be an excellent type of experimental fish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>In the present study, we performed cross-subfamily nuclear transfer between zebrafish and rare minnow and obtained nuclear transfer embryos derived from zebrafish nuclei and rare minnow enucleated eggs. Using a suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) approach, we found a novel gene &#x02013; K31 over-expressed in cloned embryos, potentially participating in the improper reprogramming of transferred nuclei.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Identification of K31 as an up-regulated gene</title><p>To better understand the molecular events in cloned embryos, we performed nuclear transfer between two laboratory fish, zebrafish and rare minnow.

By using a SSH approach, we have totally screened out 50 differentially expressed genes in the cloned embryos at sphere stage. Among them, about 10% are related to redox function, such as selenoprotein W1, 5-lipoxygenase and glutaryl-coenzyme dehydrogenase <italic>etc</italic>; about 6% are responsible for cell growth and division, including geminin, daz-like gene and cofactor of BRCA2 <italic>etc</italic>. Interestingly, a novel gene, K31, was found to be up-regulated in the cloned embryos at sphere stage. Real-time RT-PCR analysis showed that the mRNA abundance of K31 gene in the cloned embryos was about 15-fold than that in normally fertilized zebrafish embryos (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), which was agreement with the dot blotting assay.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Real time PCR analysis of K31 gene</bold>.

Cross-genus cloned fish derived from common carp nuclei and goldfish enucleated eggs was given birth as reported by Sun et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In our recent study, we not only demonstrated the success of cloned embryos derived from zebrafish nuclei and rare minnow enucleated eggs, but also the success of cloned embryos derived from rare minnow nuclei and zebrafish enucleated eggs by SCAR approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Samples used in the present study were strictly chosen at sphere stage of embryogenesis as described by Kimmel et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] to ensure the accuracy. In single cloned embryo, SCAR PCR was performed with primers distinguished rare minnow from zebrafish, revealing the success of nuclear transfer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Consequently, the novel gene, K31, is certainly resulted from the nucleo-cytoplasmic interaction between zebrafish and rare minnow, excluding any artificial interfere.</p><p>Previous studies demonstrated that the majority of embryos produced by nuclear transfer were compromised because they were unable to develop past the early development stages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. A common hypothesis is that inefficient reprogramming of the donor nucleus results in inappropriate expression of genes required for embryonic development. Gene expression analysis of individual embryos will undoubtedly yield new insights into the regulatory mechanisms involved in nuclear transfer inducing reprogramming and embryonic development. In the present study, a novel gene, K31 was found to be over-expressed in cross-subfamily cloned embryos by SSH approach. To our knowledge, this is the first report of gene expression analysis in cross-subfamily cloned embryos. Interestingly, K31 transcripts were found in all embryonic development stages of zebrafish and K31 was also expressed maternally in ovum, but its ectopic over-expression caused the EPC cells to die during the cell culture. Result of sub-cellular localization indicates that K31 protein can not penetrate the nuclei, and it may be participate in signal transduction by its five putative phosphorylation sites. Previous studies indicated that the reprogramming efficiency of cloned embryos was influenced by many factors, such as epigenetic changes like DNA methylation and XCI patterns[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], failure to suppress previously active gene transcription as well as failure to activate previously inactive genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], failure of chromatin remodeling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] and mitochondria effects of proper reprogramming [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], <italic>etc</italic>. Yet, we can conclude that nucleo-cytoplasmic interaction in such cross-subfamily cloned embryos caused the over-expression of K31 gene. Further reliable studies in a comprehensive way should provide solid evidences to unveil whether K31 gene can affect the nuclear reprogramming in cloned embryos.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Cross-species nuclear transfer can be used to maintain limited populations of highly endangered species, especially when the oocytes of these species are difficult to obtain. However, most embryos produced by cross-species nuclear transfer were compromised because they were unable to develop to later developmental stages. Therefore, gene expression analysis of cross-species cloned embryos is necessary. Here we used two laboratory fish species, rare minnow and zebrafish as cross-subfamily nuclear transfer model and report K31 gene as an up-regulated gene in fish cross-subfamily cloned embryos. Importantly, ectopic over-expression of K31 gene can cause lethality of EPC cells in the cell culture, which gave hint that why most of the cloned embryos were developmentally arrested in between the stages of sphere and 50% epiboly.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Preparation of cross-subfamily cloned embryos and non-cloned embryos</title><p>The cross-subfamily cloned embryos were generated by nuclear transfer as described by Sun et al.

In brief, the samples were placed in 96 well plates and amplified in an automated fluorometer (ABI PRISM 7000 Sequence Detection System, Applied Biosystems). Each PCR proceeded in 30 &#x003bc;l SYBR Green PCR buffer (Applied Biosystems) containing 400 nM K31F and K31R primers, 1 U AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase, 2.5 mM dNTPs, 0.5 U AmpErase UNG, 3 mM MgCl<sub>2 </sub>and 50 ng cloned embryos or non-cloned embryos cDNA template. Amplification conditions were 2 min at 50&#x000b0;C, 10 min at 95&#x000b0;C, 40 cycles of 30 s at 95&#x000b0;C and 60 s at 60&#x000b0;C. All samples were analyzed in triplet and the results were expressed as relative fold of the expression of the GAPDH gene with 2 [-<italic>deltadeltaCT</italic>] method with correction for different amplification efficiencies (the amplification efficiency of cloned embryos or zebrafish embryos is 0.995 or 0.990, respectively) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Data mining and bio-information analyses</title><p>Homology search of K31 gene was performed on the sequences listed in EMBL/GenBank/DDBJ databases using PHI- and PSI-BLAST, EST-BLAST and Protein-protein BLAST (blastp) at the web site of the National Center of Biotechnology Information (NCBI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].
