However, GPR125 expression was transiently increased (almost 2-fold) at 4 h after traumatic brain injury (TBI) followed by a decrease (approximately 4-fold) from 2 days onwards in the choroid plexus as well as increased expression (2-fold) in the hippocampus that was delayed until 1 day after injury.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These findings suggest that GPR125 plays a functional role in choroidal and hippocampal response to injury.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) form one of the largest gene families in the human genome and participate in a wide range of physiological and sensory functions. Their ability to mediate specific signals over the cell membrane contributes to the fact that about 25% of the 100 top-selling pharmaceutical targets are GPCRs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. However, many of these receptors are still orphans with unknown functions. GPCRs can be classified into five main families; <italic>Glutamate</italic>, <italic>Rhodopsin</italic>, <italic>Adhesion</italic>, <italic>Frizzled/Tas2 </italic>and <italic>Secretin </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The characteristic 7TM domain is the hallmark of all GPCRs and the members within each of the five families are likely to share common descent. These main families can also be distinguished by different types of N-termini. Most of the receptors from the <italic>Glutamate</italic>, <italic>Secretin</italic>, <italic>Frizzled </italic>and the <italic>Adhesion </italic>families have long N-termini with functional domains while very few of the <italic>Rhodopsin </italic>receptors have such domains. The N-termini of the <italic>Adhesion </italic>family, also known as family B2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] or LNB-TM7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], are very different from those of the other groups since these consist of long stretches rich in serine and threonine which produce a stalk-like formation projecting from the cell membrane. This structure is probably very important for cell-to-cell interactions. Interestingly, these N-termini frequently contain multiple functional domains such as epidermal growth factor (EGF), cadherin, lectin, laminin, olfactomedin, immunoglobulin or trombospondin that are most commonly found in other types of protein such as integrins, cadherins and tyrosine kinases. While the <italic>Rhodopsin </italic>family is by far the largest GPCR family with many well studied amine and peptide binding receptors, the <italic>Adhesion </italic>family is the second largest family with 33 members in the human genome. Several of them were identified recently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and the functional roles of these are not well understood. The <italic>Adhesion </italic>GPCRs can be further subdivided into groups I-VIII based on phylogeny (sequence similarity) and virtually all of them contain the GPCR proteolytic site (GPS) domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>We previously identified three novel receptors; GPR123, GPR124 and GPR125, which phylogenetically cluster together with the <italic>Adhesion </italic>GPCR family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. These receptors form <italic>Adhesion </italic>Group III [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. GPR123 is highly expressed in cortical layer 5 pyramidal neurons and in most parts of the thalamus and the spinal cord [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. GPR124 and GPR125 are also known as tumor endothelial marker 5 (TEM5) and TEM5-like, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Members of the tumor endothelial marker family were originally identified by searching for genes with both elevated expression under tumor angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and cell surface expression to facilitate the drug design process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Originally, TEM5 (GPR124) was classified as GPCR-like while TEM5-like (GPR125) has only been discussed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Expression of both TEM5 and TEM5-like are elevated in human tumors and proteins for these genes were found to bind the human homologue of the <italic>Drosophila </italic>discs large tumor suppressor gene (hDlg) which localizes receptors to the cell surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. With respect to localization by Northern blot analysis, GPR125 (TEM5-like) was identified throughout many peripheral human tissues with a low expression in the brain but high expression in human brain tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. A second study suggested a developmental role for GPR125 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. GPR125 is found in highly proliferative adult spermatogonial progenitor cells (SPCs) and multipotent adult spermatogonial-derived stem cells (MASCs) but is downregulated after differentiation, thus suggesting GPR125 as a marker for cultivation of SPCs or MASCs which may later be used for transplantation therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>The purpose of this study was to describe the evolutionary history of GPR125 and map the mRNA expression pattern using <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization and real-time RT-PCR on mouse brain and peripheral tissues. Additionally, we used immunohistochemistry to localize GPR125 to a given cell type and animal models to determine whether expression of this new GPCR changes in response to pathophysiological stimuli.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Sequence retrieval and editing</title><p>Full-length <italic>Adhesion</italic>-sequences for human (Hs), mouse (Mm) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and chicken (Gg) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] were downloaded from previously published articles. The sequence for rat (Rn) corresponded to accession number XP_223485.4. The human sequences were truncated to include only the TM regions according to rps-blast at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST"/> (conserved domain database, CDD &#x02013; 12589 PSSMs) and served as probes against <italic>Tetraodon nigroviridis </italic>(Tn), <italic>Takifugu rubripes </italic>(Tr) and <italic>Drosophila melanogaster </italic>(Dm). Tn and Tr were both investigated using BLAST-like alignment tool (BLAT) searches against their genome at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgBlat"/>. Dm, on the other hand, was searched against its proteome with blastp searches at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST"/>. To rule out further hits, the previously obtained sequences were used as probes in new BLAT-searches against their respective genomes. The potential sequences were manually assembled in Editseq from the DNA-star package version 5.07 (DNASTAR, Madison, Wisconsin, United States) according to the canonical splice site GT...AG. The assembled sequences were then aligned with their probes in the Windows version of ClustalW 1.83 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] to confirm consistency of splice sites. The N-terminals of the selected sequences were assembled in the same manner as mentioned above but with the full-length human protein as probes. They were then searched for their domain extent in rps-blast with a cutoff value of 0.1.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>Adhesion </italic>confirmation</title><p>To confirm that the sequences of interest were <italic>Adhesion </italic>GPCR members, an in-house program was applied. The program searched the sequences against a blast database comprised of all human GPCR families (in-house dataset) and additional sequences from the <italic>Methuselah </italic>family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] and the <italic>cAMP </italic>family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The sequences had to fulfill the following criteria; that the first three hits were indeed <italic>Adhesion </italic>and that an overall of five of the first ten hits were <italic>Adhesion</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Phylogenetic analysis</title><p>The newly discovered sequences related to GPR125 and their homologs were collected into a FASTA file. The entire human <italic>Adhesion </italic>GPCR repertoire together with Gg and Mm members of group III, according to previous division of the <italic>Adhesion </italic>family conducted by Bjarnadottir and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], additional <italic>Methuselah </italic>sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] and the complete human <italic>Secretin </italic>family (in-house data) was also included in the file. Subsequent multiple alignments were performed on the file using the Windows version of ClustalW 1.83 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] with default parameter settings. Using seqboot from the Win32 version of the PHYLIP 3.65 package [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], the alignment was bootstrapped 1000 times. The output file from seqboot was then subjected to protdist from the Win32 version of the PHYLIP 3.65 package using the Jones-Taylor-Thornton matrix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The neighbour command with default settings, from the Win32 version of the PHYLIP 3.65 package, was then used to construct neighbour-joining trees from the distance file produced by protdist. In order to combine the trees into a consensus tree, the command consense from the Win32 version of the PHYLIP 3.65 package was used with the majority rule and then plotted in the Win32 version of TreeView 1.6.6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The consensus tree was then weighted in TreePuzzle version 5.2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] with the settings; Tree reconstruction, evaluate user-defined trees, exact (slow) parameter estimates, Mueller-Vingron model of substitution, gamma distributed rates as model of heterogeneity estimated from the data set and eight categories of gamma rate. The remaining parameters were kept default.</p></sec><sec><title>Experimental subjects</title><p>All experiments were approved by the institutional animal care and use committees in Sweden, Portugal and the United States. Animal care procedures followed the guidelines of Swedish regulation (Animal Welfare Act SFS1998:56) and EU legislation (Convention ETS123 and Directive 86/609/EEC).</p></sec><sec><title>Gene expression using qPCR</title><sec><title>Tissue collection</title><p>To prepare the mouse tissue panel, 4 adult, male Sv129 (Alab, Sollentuna, Sweden) were housed in a climate-controlled facility (12 hr light/dark cycle with lights on at 07.00) with constant temperature (22&#x02013;23&#x000b0;C) and 55% humidity. Animals were given 7 days to acclimatize to the local conditions and had free access to water and R36 food pellets (Labfor Lactamin, Vadstena, Sweden). Between 3 and 6 hours into the light period, animals were decapitated for dissection of brains and various peripheral tissues. Brains were placed in a brain matrix for dissection into areas indicated in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> while peripheral organs were taken in their entirety. All samples were frozen on a dry ice block before immersion into RNALater solution (Ambion). Following 1 hr of incubation at room temperature to allow complete penetration of the tissue, samples were stored at -80&#x000b0;C until further processing.</p></sec><sec><title>RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis</title><p>Tissue samples were homogenized in TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Sweden) using a Branson sonicator. Total RNA was extracted according to the manufacturer's protocol (Invitrogen, Sweden). To remove contamination, samples were treated with DNase I (Roche Diagnostics, Sweden) at 37&#x000b0;C for 4 hours followed by 15 minutes at 75&#x000b0;C to inactivate the enzyme. To confirm that there was no DNA contamination, a PCR was performed on the RNA sample using reference gene GAPDH as a positive control. If bands were detected after this PCR, DNase I treatment was repeated until no amplification was observed in the RNA. The concentration of RNA was measured with the Nanodrop<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>ND-1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, Delaware, USA). cDNA was then synthesized according to the manufacturer's protocol with M-MLV reverse transcriptase (GE Healthcare, Sweden) and random hexamers (GE Healthcare, Sweden). To ensure presence of cDNA in the samples, a PCR was run (again with GAPDH as positive control) but this time a band was expected for each sample.</p></sec><sec><title>Primer Design</title><p>Primers were designed using Beacon Designer v4.0 (Premier Biosoft, USA) and specificity was verified via a BLAST search against the genome.

For each primer pair, 50 PCR cycles were run with parameters of 95&#x000b0;C for 15 s, 58.2&#x02013;62&#x000b0;C (depending on primer) annealing for 30 s followed by extension at 72&#x000b0;C for 30 s. A melting curve analysis was performed following the cycles to ensure that a single PCR product was formed in the reaction. Primers were originally optimized by running a temperature gradient (annealing temperature from 52&#x000b0;C to 62&#x000b0;C across the rows of the plate) to give an optimal temperature of 62&#x000b0;C for mouse GPR125.</p></sec><sec><title>Normalization and data analysis</title><p>Data was obtained using the MyIQ software (Bio-Rad) and a normalization factor was calculated using the 7 reference genes and the GeNorm method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].

Rats were anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium (60 mg/kg, i. p.) and were placed in a stereotactic frame. A 4-mm craniotomy was performed on the right side of the skull to expose the dura, with the center of the opening located 3 mm posterior to bregma and 2.5 mm lateral to the midline. The velocity of impact was 5 m/sec and the duration of impact was 50 msec. The diameter of impactor's tip was 2.5 mm and the depth of brain deformation was set at 3 mm. Immediately after the insult, the scalp was closed with a nylon suture and the rats were allowed to recover in their cages. At 2, 4, 6, 24, 48 and 96 h after injury (n = 3&#x02013;6 animals per time point), samples of the lateral ventricle choroid plexus and the hippocampus ipsilateral and contralateral to the injury side were collected for qPCR analysis. qPCR results are presented as the mean number of copies of GPR125 mRNA per 100 copies of cyclophilin A mRNA &#x000b1; S.E.M.

An enlargement using a 63&#x000d7; objective (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>) clearly indicates co-localization of GPR125 in choroid plexus cells. Localization of GPR125-positive staining in the choroid plexus itself was confirmed using an antibody against glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP, dark blue) which stains GFAP-positive ependymal cells that line the ventricle walls (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>).</p><p>To demonstrate localization of the GPR125 protein in the choroid plexus, sections were labeled with the GPR125 antibody (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>).

GPR125 expression in the choroid plexus significantly changed after injury (ANOVA; F = 22.1, p &#x0003c; 0.001). At 4 h post-TBI, the level of expression of GPR125 in both the ipsilateral and contralateral plexuses was higher than those observed at 2 and 4 days (p &#x0003c; 0.01&#x02013;0.05) post-TBI. Furthermore, the expression of GPR125 in the ipsilateral choroid plexus at 6 h after injury was elevated compared to the levels found in both the contralateral and ipsilateral plexuses at 2 (p &#x0003c; 0.01) and 4 days (p &#x0003c; 0.05) post-TBI. In addition, a significant difference (p &#x0003c; 0.05) in GPR125 mRNA between the ipsilateral and contralateral plexuses was observed at 6 h post-TBI. GPR125 expression in the hippocampus was also significantly affected by injury (ANOVA; F = 13.7, p &#x0003c; 0.001). The expression of GPR125 in the contralateral hippocampus at 1 day post-TBI was increased compared to the expression levels observed in both the contralateral and ipsilateral hippocampi at 2 (p &#x0003c; 0.01) and 4 h (p &#x0003c; 0.01) after injury. Additionally, a significant difference (p &#x0003c; 0.01) in GPR125 expression between the ipsilateral and contralateral hippocampi was observed at 1 day post-TBI.

We found this gene to be present in fish, the two teleosts (<italic>Tetraodon nigroviridis </italic>and <italic>Takifugu rubripes</italic>), as well as chicken, suggesting that this gene appeared at least 450 million years ago. It is, therefore, likely to be present in most vertebrates. Moreover, all the vertebrate species we investigated had a single copy of a GPR125 gene without any duplicates. This is in contrast to GPR123 which is present in fish together with an extra copy termed GPR123-like [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and some other <italic>Adhesion </italic>GPCRs that show differences in gene repertoire between mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. GPR124, however, does not seem to be present in teleosts while it is found in chicken. Interestingly, our evolutionary mining and phylogenetic analysis identified a <italic>Drosophila </italic>sequence, DmCG15744, which is a common ancestor for the entire Group III of <italic>Adhesio</italic>n GPCRs. DmCG15744 did not group with other <italic>Drosophila </italic>sequences, other <italic>Adhesion </italic>GPCRs or the Methuselah-like GPCRs found in <italic>Drosophila </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], further supporting the notion that this is an ancestral gene to Group III. DmCG15744 had approximately 20% sequence identity to GPR123, GPR124 and GPR125 but has few introns and, thus, less complex genomic structure than its descents in fish and mammals (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). The fish genes have lower genomic complexity which suggests an increase over evolution in the number of introns in this lineage which concurs with the hypothesis that intron numbers in GPCRs are increasing through the evolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Interestingly, DmCG15744 shares Ig, LRR and HBD domains with the fish and mammalian GPR125 as well as the mammalian GPR124 (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>), providing further strong support for the suggestion that this is a common ancestor to this group. A 17.8% amino acid sequence similarity was observed to human GPR125 and both genes contain HBD, Ig and two LRR domains in the N-terminal regions. However, DmCG15744 does not contain a GPS domain which is surprising as the GPS domain is likely to be found in common ancestors to all the <italic>Adhesion </italic>GPCRs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. In addition to this, we performed a second analysis using the Amphioxus sequence published from our recent report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] and this branch coincided with DmCG15744, suggesting similar conclusions with respect to ancestry and conservation.</p><p>The study on a wide tissue panel shows that the mRNA for GPR125 was expressed in the periphery (particularly in the lung, kidney and pancreas) but also in the brain which is in line with previous studies by Yamamoto and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Our more detailed mapping of the brain found highly specific expression of GPR125 in cells of the choroid plexus in the mouse brain. The choroid plexus is the major source of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and is a site of the blood-CSF barrier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Choroid plexus cells are of epithelial origin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] and were therefore immunopositive for cytokeratin which is a protein specific for epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. In the choroid plexus, the pattern of staining for GPR125 was similar to that found for cytokeratin staining and its filamentous appearance suggests a role of this receptor in cell-cell adhesion or choroid plexus barrier function. Immunostaining for GPR125 in 3-week-old rats also confirms the expression of this receptor in the pre-adolescence period and suggests a functional role in postnatal development in addition to the previously reported early developmental properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Interestingly, a choroid plexus and cerebrospinal fluid is present in all vertebrate species but not Amphioxus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Therefore, selective localization of GPR125 in the choroid plexus concurs with our evolutionary findings and suggests a conserved function important for vertebrates.</p><p>With knowledge of the evolutionary history and localization of GPR125, it is possible to search for the function of this GPCR. The search for <italic>Adhesion </italic>receptor function is difficult and the function of very few of these receptors have been determined compared to other GPCR classes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Brain-specific angiogenesis inhibitor I (BAI1) is one <italic>Adhesion </italic>receptor of known function which recognizes phosphatidylserine on apoptotic cells and subsequently promotes engulfment of these cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. The involvement of BAI1 in tumor growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] and the report of elevated GPR125 in human tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] suggests one line of research to decipher the function of GPR125. Consultation of protein-protein interaction databases (for example, STRING; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://string.embl.de"/>) suggests interaction of GPR125 with synapse-associated protein 97 (SAP-97 or hDlg) which was previously reported in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and latrophilin, a protein involved in synaptic function and carbohydrate binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. We observed a hormone binding domain in GPR125 but it is difficult to speculate which hormone may bind to this. However, this does suggest a role of GPR125 in the transfer of a message from the periphery via some circulating hormone, thus forming the basis of our study of inflammation and response to brain injury.</p><p>Very few genes are expressed selectively in specific brain structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] or brain cell types, but our results show abundant and specific expression in cells of the choroid plexus as determined by <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization and immunohistochemistry. Although we also found some expression in the cortex and periphery, it is likely that GPR125 may serve as a specific marker for choroid plexus cells and may thus be useful for the specific targeting of choroid plexus function in transgenic animals. We have previously described the selective production of transthyretin in the choroid plexus and this protein binds the &#x003b2;-amyloid peptide which is known to accumulate during Alzheimer's disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. The selective localization of GPR125 to the choroid plexus may also suggest a role for this in the etiology of Alzheimer's.</p><p>The choroid plexus expresses a wide range of receptors and neuropeptides capable of signaling and immunological defense [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] and we hypothesized that GPR125 could be involved in one of these processes. We have previously shown that induction of an inflammatory response by peripheral injection of LPS increases mRNA expression of cytokines IL-1&#x003b2; and TNF-&#x003b1; in the choroid plexus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Inflammation itself induces expression of ICAM-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] and this adhesion molecule is thought to mediate influx of T-cells from the blood to the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. However, induction of inflammation by LPS did not change GPR125 expression at any of the time points investigated, suggesting a lack of GPR125 regulation by changes in peripheral inflammatory mediators. Despite these findings, GPR125 could be involved in signal transduction of peripheral inflammation to the brain through the choroid plexus via mechanisms not requiring alterations in gene expression.</p><p>Function of the choroid plexus declines with age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] and these differences are even more pronounced in neurodegenerative diseases. For example, patients with Alzheimer's disease have a 22% greater choroid plexus epithelial cell atrophy compared to controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] and the decrease in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) production with age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] may lead to the accumulation of &#x003b2;-amyloid peptides in the brain which could eventually form plaques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Additionally, cerebral ischemia produced by middle cerebral artery occlusion induces apoptotic cell death in the choroid plexus which spreads to the neighbouring hippocampus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Changes in GPR125 expression were measured after traumatic brain injury (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). Whereas no differences between the contralateral and ipsilateral expression (except at 6 h post-TBI) were observed in the choroid plexus, the expression transiently increased at 4 h after injury followed by a decrease from 2 days onwards. Increased expression in the hippocampus, a brain structure having a close contact with CSF, was delayed until 1 day after injury. These observations suggest that the CSF pathways may play a role in the injury-mediated regulation of GPR125 expression in both the choroid plexus and hippocampus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. These results illustrate an important difference in sensitivity between <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization and qPCR since the hippocampus was positive for mRNA of GPR125 even though expression was considerably less than the cortex. Nonetheless, TBI caused a significant induction of GPR125 mRNA in the hippocampus after initial increases in the choroid plexus (2-fold increase over basal levels). This suggests that despite low basal levels of GPR125 expression in many brain regions, the gene can be upregulated in response to challenges such as brain injury.</p><p>Real-time RT-PCR data identified mRNA for GPR125 in small quantities throughout the brain. This was confirmed by <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization data as scattered expression across the cortex (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). The expression pattern of GPR125 is very different compared to GPR123 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] despite the similarity of these receptors and classification together as Group III <italic>Adhesions</italic>. GPR125 is expressed in select regions of the brain and more widely in the peripheral organs while GPR123 was selectively expressed in the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. A difference in function is also suggested by the presence of HBD, Ig and GPS domains on GPR125 and the absence of these in GPR123 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). The expression pattern of GPR125, in human tissues corresponds somewhat to the expression pattern observed in mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Major differences include a lower expression in the human brain and virtually no expression in the human lung [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. However, it is difficult to compare and quantify differences between Northern blot measurements and qPCR results. Importantly, GPR125 is highly upregulated in tumor samples from human brains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], which also suggests a role for GPR125 in cancer or an upregulation of this in relation to cancer progression.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, GPR125 is an <italic>Adhesion </italic>GPCR which has a long evolutionary history in vertebrates. In contrast to GPR123 which is selectively expressed in the brain, GPR125 is expressed both in the brain and periphery. We have demonstrated that GPR125 expression is increased after TBI whereas no changes were observed after peripheral induction of inflammation. The connection of GPR125 expression to brain injury suggests a functional role of this receptor in response to and/or recovery from injury.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>CP and MH performed the <italic>in situ</italic>, immunohistochemistry and tissue panel PCR.
