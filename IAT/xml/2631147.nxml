Their activity is tightly controlled by epidermal protease inhibitors like the lympho-epithelial Kazal-type inhibitor (LEKTI). Defects of the LEKTI-encoding gene serine protease inhibitor Kazal type (<italic>Spink</italic>)5 lead to the absence of LEKTI and result in the genodermatose Netherton syndrome, which mimics the common skin disease atopic dermatitis. Since many KLKs are expressed in human skin with KLK5 being considered as one of the most important KLKs in skin desquamation, we proposed that more inhibitors are present in human skin. Herein, we purified from human stratum corneum by HPLC techniques a new KLK5-inhibiting peptide encoded by a member of the Spink family, designated as <italic>Spink9</italic> located on chromosome 5p33.1. This peptide is highly homologous to LEKTI and was termed LEKTI-2. Recombinant LEKTI-2 inhibited KLK5 but not KLK7, 14 or other serine proteases tested including trypsin, plasmin and thrombin. <italic>Spink9</italic> mRNA expression was detected in human skin samples and in cultured keratinocytes. LEKTI-2 immune-expression was focally localized at the stratum granulosum and stratum corneum at palmar and plantar sites in close localization to KLK5. At sites of plantar hyperkeratosis, LEKTI-2 expression was increased. We suggest that LEKTI-2 contributes to the regulation of the desquamation process in human skin by specifically inhibiting KLK5.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The skin protects us from water loss and mechanical damage. The surface-exposed epidermis, a self-renewing stratified squamous epithelium composed of several layers of keratinocytes, is most important for the barrier defense against these challenges. Keratinocytes in the outmost stratum corneum (SC) of the epidermis are shed off and replaced by newly differentiated cells originating from epidermal stem cells located in the basal layer. They undergo a specific differentiation process and form the cornified envelope, which is a rigid and insoluble protein and lipid structure with essential properties of the barrier function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004372-Kalinin1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004372-Candi1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Recent discoveries have highlighted the importance of protease-inhibitors and proteases as key players in the desquamation process and in epidermal barrier function.</p><p>Human tissue kallikreins, or kallikrein-related peptidases (KLK), are the largest family of trypsin or chymotrypsin-like secreted serine proteases encoded by 15 genes on chromosome region 19q13.4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004372-Yousef1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.

Epidermal overexpression of KLK7 resulted in pathologic skin changes with increased epidermal thickness, hyperkeratosis, dermal inflammation, and severe pruritus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004372-Hansson1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. The activity of the KLKs is regulated by the pH and specific protease inhibitors in human skin. The importance of epithelial protease inhibitors has been revealed impressively in Netherton Syndrome (NS; OMIM 256500), an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in the serine protease inhibitor Kazal-type 5 (<italic>Spink5</italic>) gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004372-Chavanas1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>.

The inhibitory functions of LEKTI are highly diverse.

Though LEKTI is absent, NS patients can still develop hyperkeratosis &#x02013; a clinical sign of inhibited desquamation.</p><p>Therefore, we speculated that more KLK inhibitors are present in human skin generating a complex network of KLKs and their inhibitors to control the desquamation process. Since KLK5 is thought to be one of the most important enzymes involved in this process, we started a preparative attempt to identify KLK5 inhibitors in human stratum corneum. Herein we report the identification of a new protease inhibitor LEKTI-2 and its gene <italic>Spink9</italic>, which specifically inhibits KLK5.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Identification of a new KLK5-inhibiting peptide in human Stratum corneum</title><p>To follow the hypothesis that specific inhibitors for KLK5 exist in human skin, extracts from healthy persons' SC were analyzed for KLK5-inhibiting activity.

Based on the generated theoretical partial DNA sequence, gene-specific primers were designed to perform 3&#x02032;- and 5&#x02032;-RACE. The full-length cDNA sequence (453 bp) was completed by combining the overlapping sequences from each PCR product and then confirmed by a long distance PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004372-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>; GenBank accession No. AY396740).

Only the P1 residue of the putative active site is different, suggesting they might have different substrate binding modes.

We identified a new peptide termed LEKTI-2 as a specific inhibitor for KLK5, which is encoded by <italic>Spink9</italic>, a novel member of the Spink gene family. Our findings give evidence for the importance of LEKTI-2 in epidermal desquamation and provide new insight to the complex protease-protease inhibitor interaction in human skin.</p><p>LEKTI-2 expression shows some similarities to the expression of LEKTI, which was demonstrated to be expressed in lamellar bodies, likely the granular-like structures in our fluorescent staining, and secreted into the intercellular space, in the uppermost stratum granulosum <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004372-Sondell1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004372-IshidaYamamoto2">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Electron microscopy studies revealed that LEKTI and KLK7 are transported separately in the lamellar granule system and are co-localized in the extracellular spaces <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004372-IshidaYamamoto2">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Our findings of LEKTI-2 and KLK5 expression are accordable to those results but need further evaluation by electron microscopy. However, LEKTI-2 expression was only detected in our studies at palmar and plantar sites where a rigid SC is needed to protect the hands and feet from mechanical damage. The fact that we did not find LEKTI-2 immunoreactivity at other sites, though low mRNA expression was detectable in skin samples, points to a minor role of LEKTI-2 in non-plantar skin compared to LEKTI, which is expressed throughout the entire skin. The circumstance that we used plantar human callus as the natural source of KLK5 inhibitors was therefore beneficial for the identification LEKTI-2. The enhanced expression of LEKTI-2 in plantar clavus corroborates the hypothesis that LEKTI-2-mediated KLK5 inhibition results in suppressed desquamation. Clavi are often induced by abnormal local mechanical pressure due to malformation of feet bones or tight footgear. It will be interesting to study how LEKTI-2 expression is induced by these mechanical forces. Mechanical stress represents an important part of signaling in skin. Indeed, <italic>in vitro</italic> it induces phosphorylation of keratin K6 and EGFR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004372-Yano1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref> and clustering of beta1-integrins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004372-Knies1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, and activates ERK1/2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004372-Yano1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref> as well as Akt, one of the kinases known to suppress apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004372-Yano2">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Most notably, LEKTI-2 exhibited only inhibiting activity against tryptic KLK5 but not against the chymotryptic KLK7, tryptic KLK14 or all other serine proteases tested including trypsin and chymotrypsin. LEKTI-2 activity differs in this respect from that of LEKTI, which contains multiple Kazal domains exhibiting highly diverse inhibitory functions beyond others against trypsin, plasmin, subtilisin A, cathepsin G, and human neutrophil elastase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004372-Mitsudo1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, the functions of both Kazal-type inhibitors are suspected to be different. Overall trypsin-like and/or chymotrypsin-like activities resulting mainly from KLKs are considerably elevated in the skin of <italic>Spink5</italic>-deficient mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004372-Descargues1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref> and in NS patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004372-Komatsu1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004372-Hachem1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. The elevated activities cause increased degradation of corneodesmosomal cadherins in NS patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004372-Descargues2">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. It was shown that KLKs are capable of cleaving corneodesmosomes, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004372-Simon1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004372-Borgono1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, Kallikrein-mediated proteolysis regulates the antimicrobial effects of cathelicidins in skin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004372-Yamasaki1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref> and contributes to the pathogenesis of rosacea <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004372-Yamasaki2">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover, KLK5 and KLK14 haven been reported to activate the protease activated receptor (PAR)-2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004372-Stefansson1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, a signaling receptor in epidermal inflammation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004372-Steinhoff1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref> and regulator of epidermal barrier function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004372-Hachem2">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. Altogether, these accumulating data strongly suggest that in skin, KLKs are desquamation-related serine proteases and that the balance between serine proteases and inhibitors may be essential, not only for steady desquamation but also for skin barrier function and inflammation. Regulation of KLKs by endogenous proteinase inhibitors like LEKTI and LEKTI-2 might therefore have therapeutic potential in inflammatory skin diseases.</p><p>The K<sub>i</sub> of LEKTI-2 against KLK5 observed herein can be considered as preliminary since more in depth analysis of inhibition was not possible in this study due to limited access to KLK5. Several LEKTI domains have been reported to inhibit KLK5 in various reports. In comparison, the determined K<sub>i</sub> of LEKTI domains to inhibit KLK5 was in the range of 3 nM (domain 8&#x02013;11) to 120 nM (domain 9&#x02013;15) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004372-Egelrud1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004372-Deraison1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004372-Schechter1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. It will be very interesting to study the inhibition of other KLKs by LEKTI-2 in future investigations. KLKs are tryptic and chymotryptic enzymes though a detailed comparison of their activities, substrates and specific inhibitors has not been done systematically. As the most intensively studied KLK, KLK3 (also known as prostate-specific antigen), is a chymotryptic enzyme, similar in this respect to KLK7, which was not inhibited by LEKTI-2. Since <italic>Spink9</italic> mRNA was detected in other organs like tonsils, testis, placenta and brain, but not in the prostate, it remains speculative what function LEKTI-2 might have in other organs. The only LEKTI-2 target enzyme identified so far is KLK5, which was reported to be expressed at high levels (100&#x02013;1000 ng/g tissue) in breast, testis, salivary glands and thyroids but in the skin at highest reported levels (above 10,000 ng/g tissue) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004372-Shaw1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. Detailed investigations of LEKTI-2 function in other organs are required to clarify its role outside the skin.</p><p>In summary, we identified a new Kazal-type inhibitor LEKTI-2 and its gene <italic>Spink9</italic> and showed its expression in human skin.

During the evaluation phase of the assay, amplicons were analyzed by 2.0&#x00025; agarose gel electrophoresis and, where necessary purified and sequenced to confirm their identity. For calculation of the relative transcripts amplification, the housekeeping gene <italic>GAPDH</italic> was performed with each cDNA in a separate PCR reaction. The data from triplicate samples were analyzed with software (GraphPad Prism 4) and expressed as mean&#x000b1;SD of mRNA in question relative to that of GAPDH. The statistical analyses were performed with One-way ANOVA method and p&#x0003c;0.05 was considered significant while p&#x0003c;0.01 was considered very significant.</p></sec><sec id="s4g"><title>Recombinant protein production</title><p>The recombinant expression of <italic>Spink9</italic> cDNA in <italic>E. coli</italic> was performed by molecular subcloning of <italic>Spink9</italic> cDNA into the prokaryotic expression vectors pET-32a (Novagen, North Ryde, Australia). The purified form of LEKTI2 (amino acid 26 to 86) was generated as PCR fragments (Primer sequences are available upon request) by using <italic>Pfu</italic> DNA polymerase (Promega, Mannhein, Germany). PCR products were double-digested with <italic>Bgl</italic>II and <italic>Not</italic>I prior to be cloned into the similarly double-digested pET-32a vectors. Clones were sequenced to check for any mutation that might have been misincorporated during the amplification. The expression construct was transformed into <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<italic>E. coli</italic>) BL21<italic>trxB</italic>(DE3)<italic>pLysS</italic> cells (Novagen) and selected on Luria-Bertani (LB) agar plates containing carbenicillin (100 &#x000b5;g/ml), chloramphenicol (34 &#x000b5;g/ml) and kanamycin (15 &#x000b5;g/ml). Protein expression was induced with 1 mM IPTG (isopropyl thio-&#x003b2;-D-galactoside) for a 3 h. After incubation, cells were harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 1&#x000d7;LEW buffer (50 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 300 mM NaCl, pH 8.0). Resuspended cells were subjected to one cycle of freeze-thawing and sonicated on ice until complete lyses. After centrifugation at 15,500&#x000d7;g for 30 min, the clarified supernatant was applied to Protino&#x000ae;Ni prepared columns (Macherey-Nagel, Dueren, Germany) and the polyhistidine-tagged protein was eluted with 1&#x000d7;elution buffer (50 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 300 mM NaCl, 250 mM imidazole, pH 8.0). The further purification of the fusion protein was achieved by reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) using preparative wide-pore C8 RP-HPLC with a column (SP250/10 Nucleosil 300-7 C8; Macherey-Nagel) that was previously equilibrated with 0.1&#x00025; (v/v) TFA in HPLC-grade water containing 10&#x00025; acetonitrile. Proteins were eluted with a gradient of increasing concentrations of acetonitrile containing 0.1&#x00025; (v/v) TFA (flow rate, 3 ml/min). Fractions containing UV (215 nm)-absorbing material were collected, lyophilized and analyzed by ESI-QTOF-mass spectrometry (Micromass, Manchester, U.K.). The His-tagged fusion protein purified from HPLC-RP8 was cleaved from its His-tag with SUMO protease according to the manufacturer's suggestion (Lifesensors Inc., Pennsylvania, USA). The digestion mixture contained 1 unit of SUMO protease per 100 &#x000b5;g of the fusion protein in a volume of 500 &#x000b5;l of 1&#x000d7;PBS buffer and was incubated for 2 h at 30&#x000b0;C. The dialyzed sample was adjusted to a pH value of 3.0 to 4.0 and then purified by centrifugation. The supernatant was collected and injected onto a Jupiter-5&#x000b5;-C4-300A HPLC column (Phenomenex, Aschaffenburg, Germany) equilibrated with 0.1&#x00025; TFA in water. Peptides were eluted with a gradient of increasing concentrations of acetonitrile containing 0.1&#x00025; (v/v) TFA (flow rate, 0.5 ml/min). Fractions of each peak were collected, lyophilized and analyzed by ESI-QTOF-mass spectrometry.</p></sec><sec id="s4h"><title>Production of antibodies</title><p>Polyclonal antiserum was generated in a goat against a full length peptide with the amino-acid sequence of human LEKTI-2 (amino acid 26 to 86).
