Apolipoprotein (ApoE)<bold><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></bold> mice fed a high-fat diet were used as a model of atherosclerosis. Vascular and autonomic functions were measured in conscious mice using telemetry. The study revealed that PARP-1 plays an important role in dyslipidemia-associated vascular and autonomic dysfunction. Inhibition of this enzyme by gene knockout partially restored baroreflex sensitivity in ApoE<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice without affecting baseline heart-rate and arterial pressure, and also improved heart-rate responses following selective blockade of the autonomic nervous system. The protective effect of PARP-1 gene deletion against dyslipidemia-induced endothelial dysfunction was associated with preservation of eNOS activity. Dyslipidemia induced PARP-1 activation was accompanied by oxidative tissue damage, as evidenced by increased expression of iNOS and subsequent protein nitration. PARP-1 gene deletion reversed these effects, suggesting that PARP-1 may contribute to vascular and autonomic pathologies by promoting oxidative tissue injury. Further, inhibition of this oxidative damage may account for protective effects of PARP-1 gene deletion on vascular and autonomic functions. This study demonstrates that PARP-1 participates in dyslipidemia-mediated dysregulation of the autonomic nervous system and that PARP-1 gene deletion normalizes autonomic and vascular dysfunctions. Maintenance of eNOS activity may be associated with the protective effect of PARP-1 gene deletion against dyslipidemia-induced endothelial dysfunction.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Atherosclerosis, a major contributor to morbidity and mortality in developed countries, is the underlying cause of a number of cardiovascular diseases and is closely associated with dyslipidemia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007430-Libby1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007430-Russell1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

Previously, our laboratory demonstrated that PARP-1 inhibition affects atherosclerotic plaque dynamics and these alterations are highly desirable for the control of plaque progression and promotion of stability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007430-OumounaBenachour1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007430-Hans1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. Dynamics of atherogenesis are confined to atherosclerotic plaques but are integral participants of overall vascular dysfunction including hypertension, myocardial infarction and heart failure. The present study is a direct continuation of our ongoing investigation of the role of PARP-1 in atherosclerosis and associated pathologies.</p><p>Alterations in central nervous system control of BP and HR are primary outcomes of dyslipidemia. Thus, devising strategies that can diminish or completely block the manifestation of these outcomes is of great clinical importance. In this study, we demonstrate that PARP-1 plays an important role in both dyslipidemia-associated vascular and autonomic dysfunction. Inhibition of this enzyme by gene knockout partially improved baroreflex sensitivity, without affecting baseline hemodynamic parameters, and improved autonomic function. It also prevented dyslipidemia-induced endothelial dysfunction, possibly through maintenance of eNOS activity. Moreover, modulation of oxidative tissue damage may underlie the observed protective effects of PARP-1 gene knockout.</p><p>The arterial baroreceptor reflex is a classic negative feedback mechanism that is critical for maintaining BP around a setpoint by sensing its fluctuations and correcting accordingly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007430-Stauss1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007430-Nasr1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. In recent years, a great deal of evidence has accumulated that supports the ability of dyslipidemia and its associated pathologies to impair SBRS in humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007430-Stauss1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007430-Nasr1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. In fact, Nasr et al. recently showed that bilateral carotid atherosclerosis in human patients is associated with an impairment of SBRS and a shift of the sympathovagal balance toward a decrease in parasympathetic-associated HR variability<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007430-Nasr1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. Many of these changes are clearly associated with elevated oxidative stress. Our laboratory previously reported that oxidative stress contributes to autonomic dysregulation in hypertensive and hypercholesterolemic mice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007430-Lazartigues1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. The negative effect of dyslipidemia on SBRS observed is consistent with our previous studies done in ApoE<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, with the effects of dyslipidemia observed in humans as well as in LDL-receptor knockout mice, as very recently reported by Campos et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007430-Campos1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. It is noteworthy that changes in SBRS regulation may be mainly mediated by parasympathetic tone, an idea also set forth by Tank et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007430-Tank1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, the parasympathetic tone seems more sensitive to dyslipidemia than sympathetic tone. A rather important and interesting finding in this study is that PARP-1 gene deletion preserved SBRS in regular diet-fed mice, but this protective effect was completely abolished in HF diet-fed animals. The mechanism through which a HF diet overwhelms the protective effect of PARP-1 gene deletion is unknown.</p><p>PARP-1 gene deletion preserved parasympathetic tone in RD-fed mice, but failed to do so in mice fed a HF diet. Conversely, PARP-1 deficiency significantly prevented exacerbated sympathetic tone not only in regular diet-fed ApoE<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, but also in HF diet-fed animals. The reason(s) for the ability of DKO mice to maintain these responses during a regular diet regimen is unclear, and the reason(s) for their ability to maintain parasympathetic tone responses during a high-fat diet is even more puzzling. These discrepancies are not unprecedented, as Rose et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007430-Rose1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref> reported that PI3K<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice displayed similar responses, which were attributed to negative regulation of cAMP by PI3K in the ventricular myocardium. Whether PARP-1 deficiency may affect the autonomic nervous system through a mechanism involving PI3K activity and cAMP is unknown, although poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of the PI3K family member, DNA-dependent protein kinase, has been shown to enhance its kinase activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007430-Kovacs1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. However, as eluded to earlier, oxidative stress has become increasingly regarded as an important participant in vascular impairments. Therefore, PARP-1 gene deletion may preserve cardiovascular function by modulating factors that instate oxidative stress. Inhibition of iNOS overexpression and subsequent nitrergic damage may be one such example.</p><p>Our data suggests that though PARP-1 gene deletion moderately increased total cholesterol levels on regular diet regimen, but HF diet induced higher total and LDL- cholesterol in ApoE<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice than DKO mice. Moreover, PARP-1 gene deletion significantly increased HDL-cholesterol, an effect which was abolished by HF diet. Interestingly, von Lukowicz et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007430-vonLukowicz1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref> reported significantly higher levels of total and LDL- cholesterol in DKO mice as compared to ApoE<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice which is in contrast to our data. However, in their study, they used 1.25&#x00025; total cholesterol in their diet which is 6 times higher than HF diet used in our studies (0.2&#x00025; cholesterol). Further mice used in our study are from homogenous background (C57BL/6J).

Interestingly PARP-1 gene deletion increased HDL by double in regular diet group, an effect which was abolished by HF diet. Though mechanism of increased HDL levels by PARP-1 gene deletion is unknown, HDL- cholesterol has independently been reported to correlate with autonomic and vascular dysfunctions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007430-Grassi1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007430-OConnell1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. <italic>ApoE<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice can develop atherosclerotic lesions while on a regular diet but require a lengthy duration </italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007430-Crauwels2">&#x0005b;<italic>40</italic>&#x0005d;</xref><italic>.

In fact, our laboratory recently demonstrated that a more complex relationship between PARP-1 and iNOS exists, as these two proteins are reciprocally regulated during airway inflammation with NF-&#x003ba;B activation serving as major component of this relationship<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007430-Naura2">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. Notably, NF-&#x003ba;B regulates the expression of iNOS during inflammation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007430-Naura1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>.

Therefore, PARP-1 deficiency may exert an antioxidant effect and maintain autonomic nervous system through a direct effect on NAD(P)H oxidase complex function. Obviously, this hypothesis needs to be confirmed through additional experimentation.</p><p>Endothelial NOS (eNOS) activity is thought to have an important influence on the activity of the sympathetic tone<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007430-Gava1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>. Pathological processes that reduce vascular NO may do so through down regulation of eNOS expression or inhibition of eNOS activity. They may also reduce vascular NO by decreasing NO bioavailability, an effect attributable to NO inactivation by radicals such as O<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup>, which generates the noxious byproduct, peroxynitrite (ONOO<sup>&#x02212;</sup>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007430-Godecke1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, increased oxidative stress in the vascular wall is a key mechanism underlying endothelial dysfunction<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007430-Godecke1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>. The increased levels of protein nitration in cardiac tissues of HF diet-fed animals is evidence for increased levels of ONOO&#x02212;, which would be suggestive of a decrease in NO bioavailability and may explain the observed endothelial dysfunction in these animals<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007430-Pacher3">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, it is tempting to speculate that the ability of PARP-1 deficiency to prevent such extensive oxidative stress and to maintain eNOS activity underlies protection against endothelial dysfunction and dysregulated autonomic nervous system.</p><p>Numerous studies of PARP-1 involvement in oxidative stress-associated endothelial dysfunction, primarily using cell culture and <italic>ex vivo</italic> systems, have demonstrated that pharmacological inhibition of PARP-1 confers protection against such dysfunction (for review<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007430-Pacher1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007430-Gero1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, using conscious animals we have demonstrated that PARP-1 participates in dyslipidemia-mediated vascular dysfunction and dysregulation of autonomic function and that PARP-1 gene deletion is protective against these defects.
