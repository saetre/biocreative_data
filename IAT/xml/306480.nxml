Unique regions near each end of the transposable element gamma-delta provide a pair of "portable" primer-specific sites for bidirectional sequencing by the dideoxy chain termination method. A set of gamma-delta insertions positioned about 200 bp apart over the entire cloned DNA allowed us to determine the sequence of both strands in a single parental plasmid without subcloning. The avtA (alanine-valine transaminase) gene of E. coli K-12 was sequenced by this approach. Surprisingly, gamma-delta insertions downstream of the coding region were found to significantly reduce avtA expression. We suggest that these nondisruptive insertions probably change the DNA topology and thereby alter gene expression.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00266-0355.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9461"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00266-0356.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9462"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00266-0357.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9463"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00266-0358.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9464"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00266-0359.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9465"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00266-0360.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9466"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00266-0361.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9467"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00266-0362.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9468"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00266-0363.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9469"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
