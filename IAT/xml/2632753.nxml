These include components of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) machinery. Disruption of subunits of ESCRT-I and &#x02013;II leads to cell-autonomous endosomal accumulation of ubiquitinated receptors, loss of apicobasal polarity and epithelial integrity, and increased cell death. Here we report that disruption of the ATPase dVps4, the most downstream component of the ESCRT machinery, causes the same array of cellular phenotypes. We find that loss of epithelial integrity and increased apoptosis, but not loss of cell polarity, require the activation of JNK signalling. Abrogation of JNK signalling prevents apoptosis in dVps4 deficient cells. Indeed double deficiency in dVps4 and JNK signalling leads to the formation of neoplastic tumours. We conclude that <italic>dvps4</italic> is a tumour suppressor in Drosophila and that JNK is central to the cell-autonomous phenotypes of ESCRT-deficient cells.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Correct receptor signalling and cell polarisation are required for proper organisation of epithelia.

The majority of class E Vps proteins constitute the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) machinery, which is conserved in metazoans, including flies and mammals. ESCRT-I, -II and -III function cooperatively in endosomal receptor sorting and MVE biogenesis. Also important in this process is the ATPase Vps4, which functions to disassemble ESCRT-III multimers, thereby allowing the recycling of subunits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004354-Raymond1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004354-Babst2">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004354-Scott1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. The role of the ESCRT machinery in whole tissues has been particularly illuminated in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster in which disruption of ESCRT-I or -II causes cell-autonomous loss of polarity, cytoskeleton disruption and apoptosis. ESCRT-deficient cells also activate Notch signalling, which triggers the release of a cytokine thus activating proliferation in adjacent, normal cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004354-Herz1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004354-Vaccari1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. In this paper, we focus on the cell autonomous effects caused by ESCRT deficiency.</p><p>Even though it is established that the ESCRTs control tissue organization, the mechanisms that mediate this activity remain unclear. Here we explore the effects of reducing the activity of Drosophila Vps4 (dVps4), the most downstream component of the ESCRT machinery. In the main, dVps4 activity was knocked down with a dominant negative construct carrying a point mutation in the catalytic site <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004354-Babst2">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Supportive evidence was also obtained with a small genomic deletion and an RNAi hairpin construct. We find that several cell-autonomous effects observed when ESCRT function is disrupted are mediated by c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) family, which has extensively been implicated in programmed cell death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004354-Davis1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref> and is misregulated in many types of mammalian cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004354-Yoshida1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004354-Ventura1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>.

Mostly small (1&#x02013;2 cells) <italic>dvps4<sup>&#x00394;7b</sup></italic> mutant clones could be recovered, probably because the FRT-mediated recombination events used to create mutant patches is triggered in individual cells and that, in isolation, <italic>dvps4<sup>&#x00394;7b</sup></italic> mutant cells undergo apoptosis faster than they can grow. In order to assess the contribution of dVps4 to the phenotype of <italic>dvps4<sup>&#x00394;7b</sup></italic> homozygous cells, we constructed a Gal4-dependent transgene to express wild type dVps4 that could be used in a rescue experiment. Expression of this transgene in wing imaginal discs caused accumulation of endocytic cargo, polarity disruption and cell death (data not shown). These are characteristics of the loss of function phenotype and it is therefore likely that overexpressed wild type protein has a dominant negative effect on ESCRT activity. Since the <italic>dvps4<sup>&#x00394;7b</sup></italic> mutant clones are so short lived and because of the possibility that the flanking genes might be affected by the deletion, we turned to RNAi-mediated knock-down <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004354-Dietzl1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref> and a dominant negative form of dVps4, dVps4-DN as means of reducing dVps4 activity. Since both the RNAi and the DN constructs can be expressed under Gal4 control and since these constructs are likely to create a hypomorphic situation, large patches of deficient tissue can be generated thus overcoming the problem of growth from a single mutant cell. As a first step, heat-shock-inducible Gal4 was used to activate the UAS-dVps4-DN transgene ubiquitously, and egg chamber phenotypes were scored. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004354-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>, this caused the accumulation of the endosome marker Hrs and conjugated ubiquitin on large structures within expressing cells. In addition we used phalloidin staining to visualize F-actin and found that the cytoskeleton was disrupted with tangles of abnormal accumulation. The same phenotype was seen in <italic>dvps4<sup>&#x00394;7b</sup></italic> patches within the follicle epithelium and was also seen in wing imaginal disc cells expressing dVps4-IR driven by 1096-Gal4, a wing pouch driver (not shown). This phenotype was not observed in egg chambers only expressing the Hs-Gal4 driver upon heat shock (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004354-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>). We conclude that, since dVps4-DN and dVps4-IR affect the endosomal distribution of ubiquitinated proteins, these constructs are likely to interfere with ESCRT activity as intended.</p><fig id="pone-0004354-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004354.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>dVps4 disruption leads to accumulation of ubiquitinated cargo and loss of cell polarity.</title><p>(A) A dVps4 eye disc mutant clone lacking GFP.

This phenotype suggests loss of cell polarity and epithelial integrity. Larvae expressing dVps4-IR or dVps4-DN in the wing disc continued to grow beyond the normal time of growth termination, became oversized and died shortly after delayed pupation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004354-g002">Fig. 2E,F</xref>).</p><p>To investigate the ultrastructural defects of dVps4-deficient cells, we performed immuno-electron microscopy (EM) on wing imaginal discs expressing dVps4-DN or dVps4-IR. As a membrane marker we used CD8-GFP (detected with gold-labeled anti-GFP) expressed from a transgene. This transgene also allowed cells expressing the knockdown construct to be identified unambiguously within the tissue. Expression of either dVps4-IR or dVps4-DN caused the formation of enlarged tubular structures, which were not seen in control discs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004354-g003">Fig. 3A,B,C</xref>). Both CD8-GFP and ubiquitin accumulated on these structures, suggesting that they represent enlarged late endosomes. Interestingly, the Notch receptor also accumulated on these structures (data not shown), which could therefore be a site of Notch signalling. As could be seen upon closer examination, in addition to accumulating ubiquitin and being positive for CD8-GFP, these enlarged MVE-like structures contained internal vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004354-g003">Fig. 3E,F,H,I</xref>). Perhaps residual dVps4 activity allows low-level endovesiculation to proceed.

Apoptosis was also enhanced in response to dVps4-IR expression (data not shown), however this was less pronounced than with dVps4-DN. This might be because the DN construct inhibits dVps4 activity more thoroughly than dVps4-IR.</p><fig id="pone-0004354-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004354.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Ultrastructural characterisation of dVps4-DN and dVps4-IR-expressing cells shows enlarged MVEs containing accumulated ubiquitinated cargo.</title><p>(A) Overview of control wing discs 1096-Gal4; CD8-GFP that contain normal MVEs as shown in the close-ups (D and G).

Little is known so far about the signalling pathway that mediates this effect. One candidate pathway is that controlled by JNK since it is known to activate apoptosis in a variety of situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004354-Noselli1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref> and references therein). Indeed, in dVps4-IR-expressing cells, the levels of phosphorylated active JNK (pJNK) were found to be upregulated in comparison to control discs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004354-g004">Fig. 4A,B</xref>). Consistent with this observation, JNK downstream targets such as &#x003b2;PS integrin (myospheroid) and matrix metalloprotease 1 (MMP1) were ectopically expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004354-g004">Fig. 4E,H</xref>), a phenotype also seen in cells that express an activated form of Hemipterous, the Drosophila JNK kinase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004354-g004">Fig. 4C,F,I</xref>). Moreover, expression of dVps4&#x02013;IR caused a similar disorganisation of the actin cytoskeleton as activated JNK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004354-g004">Fig. 4B,C,E,F</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004354-Homsy1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>.

To test this hypothesis we asked if the phenotypes caused by expression of dVps4-DN are suppressed by concomitant reduction of JNK signalling. Like dVps4&#x02013;IR, dVps4-DN caused pronounced upregulation of MMP1 and integrin expression as well as a striking disruption of the actin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004354-g005">Fig. 5A,D,G</xref>).

Therefore upregulation of actin, MMP1 and integrin expression in dVps4-DN-expressing cells is likely mediated by JNK signalling.</p><fig id="pone-0004354-g005" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004354.g005</object-id><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Downregulation of JNK signalling in dVps4-deficient cells leads to cell survival and tumour-like growth.</title><p>(A) dVps4-DN expression in wing discs marked by GFP led to upregulation of MMP1 (red) and (D) &#x003b2;-integrin (red), (D and G) disruption of actin (blue) and (G) activation of Caspase-3 (red), compared to (B, E and H) expression of Bsk<sup>DN</sup> alone.

This was noticeable in dVps4&#x02013;IR-expressing discs (not shown) and was striking in tissues expressing dVps4&#x02013;DN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004354-g005">Fig 5G</xref>). As expected, dVps4&#x02013;DN-expressing discs were much reduced in size. Such size reduction required JNK signalling since co-expression of Bsk-DN restored growth in dVps4-DN-expressing discs. In fact, discs co-expressing dVps4&#x02013;DN and Bsk-DN overgrew and reached a much larger size than control, wild type discs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004354-g005">Fig. 5J,K</xref>). A similar effect is seen in discs co-expressing dVps4&#x02013;DN and puc. Overgrowth requires inhibition of both dVps4 and JNK signalling since discs expressing either Bsk-DN or puc alone are reduced in size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004354-g005">Fig. 5K</xref>, not shown). In order to test whether suppression of JNK signalling enables overgrowth of dVps4-deficient cells by suppressing apoptosis, anti-activated Caspase-3 stainings were performed. Only sporadic low levels of activated Caspase-3 were observed in discs expressing Bsk-DN alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004354-g005">Fig. 5H</xref>). Importantly, high level staining detected in discs expressing dVps4-DN alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004354-g005">Fig. 5G</xref>) was strongly suppressed by coexpression of Bsk-DN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004354-g005">Fig. 5I</xref>). We conclude that increased apoptosis caused by loss of dVps4 function is mediated by activation of JNK signalling. However, not all phenotypes caused by dVps4 deficiency require JNK signalling. As shown in Supporting <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004354.s002">Fig. S2</xref>, the downregulation of Dlg seen following expression of dVps4-DN is not suppressed by coexpression of Bsk-DN.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study we have shown that reduced activity of the ESCRT-III regulator dVps4 causes the same array of cellular phenotypes as those seen in cells lacking ESCRT-I or -II components. These phenotypes include upregulation of MMP1 and integrin, dysregulation of the actin cytoskeleton, increased apoptosis, and loss of apico-basal polarity. In addition, we found that dVps4 knockdown also leads to activation of JNK signalling. In fact, JNK signalling appears to be a central mediator of many of the cell-autonomous phenotypes observed in dVps4-deficient cells. Indeed, all the above phenotypes, except for the loss of apico-basal polarity, are alleviated by concomitant suppression of JNK signalling.</p><p>Importantly, apoptosis in dVps4-expressing tissue was strongly counteracted by downregulation of JNK signalling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004354-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). Overexpression of Bsk-DN, or of the JNK phosphatase puc, led to a reduction of Caspase-3 staining and increased cell survival in tissue expressing dVps4-DN. By contrast, blocking JNK signalling by expressing puc did not prevent apoptosis in <italic>vps25</italic> null mutant cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004354-Herz1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. The difference could be due to the extent of loss of ESCRT function in the two situations since dVps4-DN is likely to cause a hypomorphic situation. Our results thus show that JNK is central to the induction of apoptosis under conditions of partial loss of ESCRT activity. Strikingly, simultaneous reduction of dVps4 and JNK signalling leads to the formation of neoplastic tumours. <italic>dVps4</italic> can therefore be considered a tumour suppressor gene. Importantly, such tumour suppressor activity is revealed only when activity is partially lost, perhaps because dVps4 has a pleiotropic role; complete loss of function would impede an essential cell biological activity and thus prevent growth while partial loss of function would unbridle a growth inhibiting mechanism.</p><p>Previous studies of <italic>vps25</italic> and <italic>tsg101</italic> Drosophila mutants have revealed a strong hyperplastic growth of tissue adjacent to the mutant cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004354-Herz1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004354-Thompson1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004354-Vaccari1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004354-Moberg1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. Such an effect is quite distinct from the cell autonomous overgrowth reported in this manuscript, which requires inhibition of JNK signalling. Non-autonomous overgrowth triggered by <italic>vps25</italic> and <italic>tsg101</italic> loss of function has been attributed to upregulated cytokine secretion, following autonomous activation of the Notch signalling pathway in the mutant cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004354-Herz1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004354-Thompson1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004354-Vaccari1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. We have also observed an activation of Notch signalling and cell non-autonomous hyperplastic growth in tissues flanking dVps4-IR-expressing cells (data not shown), suggesting that non-autonomous stimulation of proliferation may be a common feature of ESCRT deficiency. We suggest that both the non-cell-autonomous and the cell autonomous effects of dVps4 disruption contribute to tumourigenesis.</p><p>In conclusion, we have shown that the ESCRT-III regulator dVps4 is crucial for attenuation of signalling pathways that mediate cell-autonomous apoptosis, actin rearrangement, integrin upregulation, MMP1 upregulation and loss of polarity. With exception of the latter, all these effects can be attributed, entirely or partially, to activation of JNK. Further studies aimed at clarifying the mechanistic relationship between dVps4 inactivation and JNK activation will be required in order to fully understand the tumour suppressor function of dVps4.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Fly strains</title><p>w1118;pMR&#x0005b; w&#x0002b;, UAS-vps4/CG6842&#x0005d;-IR-2 # 35126 (Vienna Drosophila RNAi Center). dVps4DN was constructed as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004354-Rusten1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. <italic>dvps4<sup>&#x00394;7b</sup></italic> Frt19 mutant clones were generated by using yw, Ubi-GFP,w&#x0002b;, FRT19A; eyflp(II) (LO-GFP clones) from D.
