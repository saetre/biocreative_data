The outer shell is composed of pentamers of the major capsid protein, VP1, linked via their flexible carboxy-terminal arms. Its morphogenesis occurs by assembly of capsomers around the viral minichromosome. However the steps leading to the formation of mature virus are poorly understood. Intermediates of the assembly reaction could not be isolated from cells infected with wt SV40. Here we have used recombinant VP1 produced in insect cells for <italic>in vitro</italic> assembly studies around supercoiled heterologous plasmid DNA carrying a reporter gene. This strategy yields infective nanoparticles, affording a simple quantitative transduction assay. We show that VP1 assembles under physiological conditions into uniform nanoparticles of the same shape, size and CsCl density as the wild type virus. The stoichiometry is one DNA molecule per capsid. VP1 deleted in the C-arm, which is unable to assemble but can bind DNA, was inactive indicating genuine assembly rather than non-specific DNA-binding. The reaction requires host enzymatic activities, consistent with the participation of chaperones, as recently shown. Our results demonstrate dramatic cooperativity of VP1, with a Hill coefficient of &#x0223c;6. These findings suggest that assembly may be a concerted reaction. We propose that concerted assembly is facilitated by simultaneous binding of multiple capsomers to a single DNA molecule, as we have recently reported, thus increasing their local concentration. Emerging principles of SV40 assembly may help understanding assembly of other complex systems. In addition, the SV40-based nanoparticles described here are potential gene therapy vectors that combine efficient gene delivery with safety and flexibility.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>SV40, a member of polyomaviradae family, has a small double-stranded circular DNA genome of 5.2 kb. The DNA is complexed with histones, forming a nucleosomal structure similar to cellular chromatin, referred to as a minichromosome. The SV40 structure has been solved at 3.1 &#x000c5; resolution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000765-Stehle1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. The viral capsid, surrounding the viral minichromosome, is a <italic>T</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;7d icosahedral lattice &#x0223c;45 nm in diameter. It is composed of three viral-encoded proteins, VP1, VP2, and VP3. VP3 translation initiates from an internal AUG within the VP2 coding sequence utilizing the same translational frame. Thus both proteins share 234 identical amino acids at their carboxy part, and are frequently referred to as VP2/3. VP1 forms the outer shell while VP2 and VP3 bridge between the VP1 shell and the chromatin core. The VP1 monomers are tightly bound in pentamers that are readily formed in the cytoplasm following mRNA translation, through interdigitating &#x003b2;-strands <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000765-Li1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

The puzzle how the variability in contacts between the identical building blocks is achieved has been solved by the elegant X-ray crystal structure study, which has shown that the pentamers are tied together via the long flexible C-arms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000765-Liddington1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Five C-arms extend from each pentamer and insert into the neighboring pentamers in three distinct kinds of interactions.

The 75S nucleoprotein complex was found to rapidly convert to 200S pre-virions, with a full complement of capsid proteins.

For the present study we have chosen to dissociate the particles by DTT and to avoid the use of chelating agents, as they might interfere in subsequent steps of DNA binding and assembly. As observed by EM, the VLPs start dissociating at 5 mM DTT and at 15 mM they are no longer visible (not shown).</p><p>As the DNA-binding domain of VP1 is at the internal face of the capsid, we have anticipated that the pentamers would assemble around the DNA. Based on this rationale, the disassembly-assembly reaction has been planned in 3 steps: Step A, dissociation of the VLPs in DTT; step B, the addition of DNA with concomitant dilution of the DTT to allow VP1-DNA binding and assembly; and step C, stabilization of the re-assembled capsids.

As expected, control experiments showed absolute requirement for VP1 and DNA. As an additional control we used a mutant VP1, VP1&#x00394;C, with a deletion of the entire carboxy terminal arm that links between pentamers. As the DNA-binding domain is at the amino terminus of VP1, this mutant retains DNA-binding activity but cannot assemble into capsids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000765-Roitman1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>.

The particles assemble at a stoichiometry of one DNA molecule per capsid, forming uniform particles of the same size, shape and density in CsCl as wild type SV40. Convincing evidence for genuine assembly, rather than non-specific association that protects the DNA from DNase I, is also provided by the finding that VP1-&#x00394;C mutant has not been active in this reaction. This mutant VP1 retains its DNA-binding domain (localized at the N-terminus) and full DNA-binding activity, while it cannot assemble into capsids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000765-Roitman1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. Its inability to package argues against non-specific VP1-DNA interaction. True DNA packaging is also suggested by the 1:1 stoichiometry of the reaction and by the supercoiled state of the packaged DNA.</p><p>How does the present assembly reaction proceed? Our data suggest the following scenario (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000765-g007">Fig. 7</xref>): The addition of DTT to nuclear extracts leads to disassembly of the VLPs into VP1 pentamers and/or pentamer-clusters (Step A). Following the addition of supercoiled DNA we propose that a number of such units bind, in a rapid reaction, along each DNA molecule (Step B), as shown by our previous EM study with the VP1-&#x00394;C mutant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000765-RoitmanShemer1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. This increases the local concentration of VP1, facilitating concerted assembly, as seen by the high VP1 cooperativity and Hill coefficient. We predict that DNA-binding is a rapid reaction, and assembly is the rate-limiting step. It is possible that some pentamer-pentamer associations occur prior to DNA-binding, and that pentamer-clusters, rather than single pentamers, serve as building blocks for assembly. However, the possibility that the capsids assemble before they bind DNA is unlikely in view of the absolute requirement for DTT at the beginning of the reaction (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0000765-t001">Table 1</xref>). Thus the DNA appears to function as a scaffold for capsid formation, as described for CCMV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000765-Mukherjee1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>.

We propose that formation of the nucleation center is followed by binding of multiple capsomers to the minichromosome at a lower affinity. They bind at quasi-random locations, as only part of the DNA is accessible depending on nucleosomal configuration. This binding increases local capsomer concentration, facilitating the highly cooperative assembly reaction as seen here. Following the equilibrium model for virus assembly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000765-Zlotnick1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, we suggest that after the initial binding of VP1 pentamers to DNA, interpentameric bonding form and dissociate in a series of equilibrium reactions until correct configuration is achieved and the icosahedral shell is completed. During this process the DNA is compacted, VP1 pentamers rearrange around the molecule as required for capsid geometry and form the proper interpentameric links, out of three different types found in the mature virion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000765-Stehle1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

Recently, the participation of chaperone machinery in assembly <italic>in vitro</italic> of empty particles of polyomavirus and SV40 (in the absence of DNA) has been clearly demonstrated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000765-Chromy1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. Specifically those studies suggested that chaperones facilitate the fomration of uniform <italic>T</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;7 nanoparticles, since in their absence polymorphic particles, mostly of smaller size, were formed. Involvement of chaperones in the present assembly reaction is suggested by the temperature and salt profiles of the reaction and the requirements for ATP and Mg<sup>&#x0002b;&#x0002b;</sup>. In addition, our recent data (Abd-El-Latif and Oppenheim, unpublished) suggest the participation of topoisomerases, as the reaction yield was affected by the addition of Etoposide , a topo II inhibitor. Topo II most likely functions in DNA compaction, facilitating its packaging inside the particles. Indeed detailed EM studies demonstrated that in the absence of host factors, when purified capsids of polyoma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000765-Stokrova1">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref> or BK <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000765-Touze1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref> were used, the DNA molecules were attached to the capsids at their external surface rather than being packaged inside.</p><p>Additional investigations are needed for full <italic>in vitro</italic> recapitulation of the assembly process, in presence of all three capsid proteins and the viral minichromosome. Nevertheless the present <italic>in vitro</italic> reaction facilitates an insight into the assembly reaction, and will serve for further biochemical and biophysical studies using both wild type and mutant VP1, and as a basis for identification of participating host factors.</p><p>Finally, the present reaction can be utilized to produce DNA-containing nanoparticles as a safe gene therapy vector. As the DNA used here is propagated in bacteria, there is no need for the SV40 <italic>ori</italic>. The absence of competing cellular chromatin relieves the requirement for the packaging signal <italic>ses</italic> and for Sp1. Thus plasmids without any SV40 sequences may be packaged, providing the vector with additional safety margin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000765-KimchiSarfaty1">&#x0005b;57&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, the absence of histones provides space and facilitates packaging of significantly larger plasmids (plasmids as large as 17 kb were shown to be packaged <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000765-KimchiSarfaty1">&#x0005b;57&#x0005d;</xref>), another significant advantage for gene therapy vectors. Together with the development of procedures for purification and concentration, we have demonstrated efficient gene delivery of the <italic>luc</italic> reporter gene, constructed as described here, to the liver in mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000765-g001">Fig. 1C</xref> in ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000765-Arad1">&#x0005b;58&#x0005d;</xref>).
