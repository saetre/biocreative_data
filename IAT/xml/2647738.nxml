We transiently co-expressed wt-CFTR and IL-8 or NF&#x003ba;B promoters driving luciferase expression in HEK293 cells. Wt-CFTR expression in HEK293 cells suppresses both basal and IL1&#x003b2; induced IL-8, and NF&#x003ba;B promoter activities as compared to the control cells transfected with empty vector (p&#x0003c;0.05). We also confirmed these results using CFBE41o- cells and observed that cells stably transduced with wt-CFTR secrete significantly lower amounts of IL-8 chemokine as compared to non-transfected control cells. To test the hypothesis that CFTR must be localized to cell surface lipid rafts in polarized airway epithelial cells in order to mediate the inflammatory response, we treated CFBE41o- cells that had been stably transduced with wt-CFTR with methyl-&#x003b2;-cyclodextrin (CD). At baseline, CD significantly (p&#x0003c;0.05) induced IL-8 and NF&#x003ba;B reporter activities as compared to control cells suggesting a negative regulation of NF&#x003ba;B mediated IL-8 signaling by CFTR in cholesterol-rich lipid rafts. Untreated cells exposed to the CFTR channel blocker CFTR-172 inhibitor developed a similar increase in IL-8 and NF&#x003ba;B reporter activities suggesting that not only must CFTR be present on the cell surface but it must be functional.

Moreover, &#x00394;F508-mice showed 100&#x00025; survival after LPS induced inflammation, similar to the wild types. This observation can be explained by a recent report that demonstrates that murine &#x00394;F508-CFTR is more efficient at trafficking to the cell surface when compared to human &#x00394;F508- CFTR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004664-Ostedgaard1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>.

Numerous studies have shown that inflammatory signaling through the NF&#x003ba;B pathway is increased in CF lungs and that this is linked to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-8 (IL-8)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004664-Blackwell1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004664-Joseph1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. However, there is little consensus on the mechanism(s) which link CFTR or its heritable mutant forms to chronic lung inflammation. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that wild-type CFTR regulates NF&#x003ba;B activity and IL-8 chemokine secretion. Our results show that CFTR cell surface expression, lipid raft localization and uninhibited channel function correlates inversely with NF&#x003ba;B and IL-8 promoter activities, and downstream inflammatory signaling.</p><p>We first demonstrated that in both unpolarized and polarized epithelial cells, CFTR is a negative regulator of NF&#x003ba;B mediated inflammatory signaling. In a much more complex <italic>in vivo</italic> system, murine model, we confirmed that CFTR is a negative regulator of the NF&#x003ba;B mediated response and absence of CFTR results in an inherent defect in I&#x003ba;B-NF&#x003ba;B mediated innate immune response. To investigate the precise role of CFTR in regulation of NF&#x003ba;B mediated IL-8 signaling we quantified NF&#x003ba;B and IL-8 reporter activities in HEK293 and CFBE41o- cells in the presence and absence of wt-CFTR. We observed that wt-CFTR negatively regulates both NF&#x003ba;B and IL-8 promoter activities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004664-g001">Fig 1A&#x00026;B</xref>). We also confirmed that CFTR regulates IL-8 reporter activity <italic>via</italic> NF&#x003ba;B by using &#x00394;NF&#x003ba;B-IL-8 promoter and observed that deletion of NF&#x003ba;B site in IL-8 promoter releases the inhibitory effect of CFTR on IL-8 promoter activity. Moreover, we demonstrate that CFTR localization to lipid rafts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004664.s001">Fig S1</xref>) is involved in control of inflammation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004664-g003">Fig 3A</xref>). Our data supports the view that in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients with &#x00394;F508-mutation, the absence of CFTR from lipid rafts or the cell surface results in chronic inflammation and lung disease. This data indicates that CFTR has anti-inflammatory properties and that the hyper-inflammation found in CF is in part due to a disruption of the signaling link between CFTR and NF&#x003ba;B. This is contrary to the concept that inflammation in the CF lung is entirely due to the loss of chloride and sodium transport causing impaired mucociliary clearance. Further work is required to determine whether rescue of a partially functional CFTR will favorably impact the balance of physiological and inflammatory pathways. A better understanding of these pathways could lead to new treatments for inflammation in CF, resulting in prolonged better quality of life for these patients.</p><p>Although it is currently not clear how mutations in CFTR lead to abnormalities of the NF&#x003ba;B pathway, our findings demonstrate that lack of functional CFTR on cell surface and not just accumulation of misfolded CFTR in the endoplasmic reticulum or some other by-product of the CTFR mutation leads to abnormal function of the NF&#x003ba;B pathway. Weber <italic>et al.</italic> recently evaluated cells with CFTR mutations that produce proteins that are trafficked normally to the cell membrane but lack Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> channel function. The G551D and &#x00394;F508 mutations were associated with up regulation of NF&#x003ba;B activation and increased production of IL-8<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004664-Weber1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. They concluded that cell lines with defective CFTR Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> channel activity, regardless of the type of CFTR defect, have a proinflammatory phenotype. Elucidating the mechanisms by which abnormal Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> channel function deregulates NF&#x003ba;B activation in CF is an important area for further investigation. Recently, Marc Chanson, Bruce Stanton and colleagues demonstrated that deletion of the PDZ binding domain of CFTR (CFTR-&#x00394;TRL) not only compromises the ability of CFTR to localize to gap junction TNF&#x003b1; protein-complex but also results in activation of downstream NF&#x003ba;B signaling. The absence of CFTR in detergent resistant membranes (DRMs) was associated with abnormal TNFR1 signaling as verified by lack of recruitment of TNFR1 and c-Src to lipid rafts in CFTR-&#x00394;TRL cells and loss of regulation of gap junctional communication (GJIC) and IL-8 secretion<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004664-Dudez1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. These results suggest that localization of CFTR in detergent resistant and cholesterol rich lipid rafts in association with c-Src and TNFR1 provides a responsive signaling complex to regulate GJIC and NF&#x003ba;B mediated cytokine signaling. This supports the idea that when &#x00394;F508 CFTR is inefficient in trafficking, there is exaggerated NF&#x003ba;B mediated signaling due to lack of gap junctional communication (GJIC) of CFTR with TNF&#x003b1; or IL1-&#x003b2; receptors. We and others have observed that transient or stable over expression of &#x00394;F508-CFTR in HEK-293 or CFBE cells results in decreased NF&#x003ba;B transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004664.s004">Fig S4</xref>), but expression of another type of CFTR mutation does not<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004664-Bartoszewski1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004664-Rab1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>.

In addition, we observed that cell surface localization of CFTR is required for regulation of gap junction communication (GJIC) and response to pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by primary signaling receptors (TNF&#x003b1;, IL1-&#x003b2; or TLRs) of innate defense (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004664-g003">Fig 3A</xref>&#x00026;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004664-g006">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004664.s001">Fig S1</xref>).

There can be two possible scenarios where CFTR channel function can regulate proinflammatory response: 1.) cell surface or 2.) DRMs. The mechanism of first scenario is apparent but it is not clear if functional CFTR is required in DRMs, we predict that non-functional channels may be incapable of localization to DRMs in presence of proinflammatory stimulus resulting in uncontrolled inflammatory response.
