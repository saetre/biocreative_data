Occupancy of intrathymic TCP niches is believed to negatively regulate TCP importation, but the nature of this feedback mechanism is not yet resolved. We show that P-selectin and CCL25 are periodically expressed in the thymus and are essential parts of the thymic gate-keeping mechanism. Periodicity of thymic TCP receptivity and the size of the earliest intrathymic TCP pool were dependent on the presence of functional P-selectin ligand on TCPs. Furthermore, we show that the numbers of peripheral blood lymphocytes directly affected thymic P-selectin expression and TCP receptivity. We identified sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) as one feedback signal that could mediate influence of the peripheral lymphocyte pool on thymic TCP receptivity. Our findings suggest a model whereby thymic TCP importation is controlled by both early thymic niche occupancy and the peripheral lymphocyte pool via S1P.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>The thymus does not contain self-renewing T cell progenitors (TCPs) and, therefore, requires continuous importation of progenitors from the blood to sustain T cell output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>). Recruitment of TCPs to the thymus is facilitated by a multistep adhesion cascade initiated by the interaction of P-selectin glycoprotein ligand 1 (PSGL-1) expressed on TCPs, with P-selectin (CD62P) expressed on thymic endothelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>). Specific N-terminal carbohydrate modifications on PSGL-1 catalyzed by glycosyltransferases are required for binding to P-selectin. In particular, the activity of the core 2 &#x003b2;1,6-glucosaminyltransferase-I (C2GnT1) has been highlighted in selectin ligand formation on PSGL-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>). Interaction of PSGL-1 with endothelial P-selectin slows down TCPs, and allows them to respond to local chemokine gradients and to engage the endothelial adhesion molecules intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) and vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) via integrins, leading to a firm arrest of TCPs on the thymic endothelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>).</p><p>Thymic TCP importation is independent of the numbers of available TCPs in the blood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>) and is not a steady-state process, as the thymus alternates between nonreceptive and receptive periods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>). This suggests that a feedback mechanism regulates expression of recruitment signals on vascular or perivascular cells. One factor proposed to control progenitor entry into the thymus is the limited availability of intrathymic niches for which TCPs compete and, thus, gain access to survival and differentiation factors necessary for their development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>). Full thymic niches are thought to trigger a feedback signal to reduce TCP importation, but the nature of these feedback signals and how they influence thymic TCP entry is unknown.</p><p>To explore the basis of feedback signals that determine periodicity in thymic TCP receptivity, we analyzed the expression of adhesion molecules in WT mice and mouse strains with distinct thymic receptivities. We found that thymic P-selectin and CCL25 expression correlated with thymic TCP receptivity, suggesting that these molecules function as thymic gatekeepers. Furthermore, we found that P-selectin expression and thymic TCP receptivity correlated inversely with peripheral lymphocyte numbers and could be manipulated by experimentally altering peripheral lymphocyte numbers. These results show that the peripheral lymphocyte pool feeds back to thymic TCP entry sites and modifies thymic TCP importation by regulating P-selectin and CCL25 expression.</p><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Thymi of PSGL-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and IL-7R&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice are hyperreceptive for TCPs</title><p>We showed previously that P-selectin is functionally involved in thymic TCP importation and that thymic P-selectin RNA expression reversely correlated with thymic niche occupancy status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>). To further characterize the relationship of thymic P-selectin expression and TCP receptivity, we used two complementary approaches to assess thymic TCP receptivity in mice deficient for IL-7R&#x003b1;, RAG-1, C2GnT1, PSGL-1, or Psel. Short-term homing assays were performed to determine the capacity of thymi to import i.v. injected CFSE-labeled bone marrow cells from the blood stream. Long-term reconstitutions of nonirradiated hosts were performed to determine the contribution of i.v. injected bone marrow cells to the host's double-positive (DP) thymocyte pool.</p><p>Short-term receptivity of thymi was expressed as a ratio of homed cells to thymic cell numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, a and b</xref>), or per milligram of thymic weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 c</xref>), to eliminate a skewing of the data because of variations in thymic size in the different mouse strains analyzed (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20082502/DC1">Fig. S1</ext-link>).

PSGL-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice also show significantly increased receptivity for CFSE<sup>+</sup> bone marrow cells, whereas C2GnT1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> thymi did not show an increased receptivity when compared with WT mice.

To test this model, we reconstituted nonirradiated IL-7R<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice with FACS-sorted TN1, TN2, or TN3 WT thymocytes and measured thymic P-selectin expression and chimerism in the thymus and blood 12 d later (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 a</xref>; and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20082502/DC1">Fig. S3, a and b</ext-link>).

TN3 cells did not give rise to TN1 or TN2 cells (Fig. S3 c), indicating that TN3 cells and their progeny are sufficient to control thymic receptivity. These data are consistent with the niche occupancy model, and we thus expected that the differences in thymic receptivities that we observed in our study were also caused by differences in thymic niche occupancy.

In this study, we extend the knowledge about the regulation of TCP entry into the thymus and provide evidence that P-selectin and CCL25 themselves are regulated in a temporal and quantitative manner. Most TCPs described so far express functional P-selectin ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>); regulation of thymic P-selectin expression thus offers an effective way to control TCP importation on a general level but does not provide specificity to the thymic recruitment process. Chemokines are likely to provide specificity, and several studies have highlighted the role of CCL25 in TCP recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>). We show that thymic endothelial cells as well as epithelial cells produce CCL25 RNA, and that thymic CCL25 is expressed periodically in parallel with P-selectin. Hence, high expression of CCL25 should preferentially enhance the thymic homing of TCPs expressing high levels of CCR9. Such CCR9<sup>hi</sup> TCPs have been shown to be more efficient in producing T cells than their CCR9<sup>lo</sup> counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>). The elevated levels of CCL25 RNA in the thymi of PSGL-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice are thus likely the explanation for the higher receptivity we observe in PSGL-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice at time points when they express similar amounts of P-selectin as WT thymi. Increased expression of CCL25 in the thymi of IL-7R<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and PSGL-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice likely also explains the relatively high importation of Lin<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CFSE<sup>+</sup> cells in the short-term homing assays.</p><p>Although the presence of homing molecules like P-selectin and CCL25 is important in regulating the quantity and quality of TCPs entering the thymus, deficiencies in these proteins can be compensated by functional redundancy among the homing molecules and by intrathymic compensatory mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>). We show that although PSGL-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>, C2GnT1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>, and Psel<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice have reduced ETP numbers, they have normal thymic cellularity, indicating that increased intrathymic proliferation can compensate for a lack in ETP numbers. Whether the T cells that result from compensatory proliferation of a reduced ETP pool are qualitatively identical to T cells that resulted from a large ETP pool remains to be investigated.</p><p>The temporal expression of thymic P-selectin we observed is remarkably stable for the first 3 wk after birth and starts to oscillate around the time of weaning. The increase in P-selectin and CCL25 expression coincides with the second wave of postnatal TCPs that seed the thymus around days 18&#x02013;22 after birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>), a period when the neonatal immune system is highly active and develops full independence of the maternal immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>). P-selectin was expressed with a periodicity of 2 wk, in agreement with an earlier study that found a 2-wk wave-like pattern of filling, occupation, and emptying of intrathymic niches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>). However, another study showed a periodicity for thymic receptivity of about 3&#x02013;4 wk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>). This discrepancy could be caused by the use of nonsynchronized mice in our work, whereas the earlier study used irradiation or intrathymic injection of bone marrow cells to synchronize the thymi of recipient mice.</p><p>One underlying cause of the periodic expression of thymic P-selectin expression could be endothelial cell turnover. However, based on the longevity of endothelial cells, which is estimated to be in the range of months to years, it is unlikely that cell turnover causes the cyclical P-selectin expression we observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>). It is also unlikely that fluctuations in CCL25 expression are caused by a highly proliferative subset of medullary epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>), as we also observed CCL25 in cortical epithelial and, particularly, in endothelial cells that produce the bulk of thymic CCL25 RNA. Instead, our observations point to the occupation status of ETP niches as a regulator for the periodicity of homing molecule expression and thymic receptivity. We found that mice with permanently contracted ETP pools lacked the periodicity of P-selectin or CCL25, supporting a model whereby ETP numbers regulate the periodic expression of P-selectin and CCL25 via a negative feedback signal. In this model, full ETP niches would trigger a negative feedback to close the thymic gates and keep them closed for 2 wk, which is the time required for TCPs to reach the TN3 developmental stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>). ETPs reside anatomically close to their thymic entry sites in the perimedullary cortical regions and asynchronously migrate from there deeper into the cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>). Given that the steady egress of cells from the ETP sites occurs at a constant rate, the shrinking ETP pool size could indeed function as a timer to prepare the TCP entry sites to up-regulate recruitment molecules, enabling the next wave of TCPs to enter the thymus. Thus, in mice that lack functional P-selectin&#x02013;PSGL-1 interaction, TCP entry is impaired and occurs at a constant rate. Hence, ETP numbers in these mice do not change over time, leaving P-selectin and CCL25 levels relatively stable.</p><p>Although periodicity of thymic receptivity seems to be exclusively regulated by an internal negative feedback signal triggered by ETP numbers, we found that the amount of homing molecules expressed on the thymic endothelium is dynamically regulated by internal and external feedback signals. The occupation status of intrathymic niches supporting DN3 thymocytes has been proposed previously as a mechanism that could limit entry of new TCPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>). Although reconstitution of IL-7R<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice with TN3 cells was in agreement with such a mechanism, we found that C2GnT1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and PSGL-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice had the same DN thymocyte subset distribution and intrathymic niche availability but differed greatly in thymic TCP importation. This observation pointed to the existence of an additional mechanism, other than intrathymic niche occupancy, that regulates thymic Psel/CCL25 expression and receptivity. Manipulation of the peripheral lymphocyte pool led, within a relatively short period of time, to significant changes in the intensity of thymic TCP importation, providing evidence for a rapid feedback mechanism between the peripheral lymphocyte pool and thymic TCP recruitment. Such a mechanism is absent in RAG-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice that are lymphopenic but have thymi that are very low in P-selectin/CCL25 and TCP receptivity. Fundamental disturbances in thymic architecture noted previously in RAG-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice may preclude formation of proper negative feedback mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>). Although the peripheral lymphocyte pool is able to alter the intensity of thymic TCP receptivity, our data do not indicate that it also affects the periodicity of P-selectin/CCL25 expression. Furthermore, homeostatic mechanisms maintain steady lymphocyte numbers over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>), making it unlikely that the peripheral lymphocyte pool contributes to periodicity in thymic TCP importation.</p><p>Our analyses have uncovered two novel phenotypes associated with PSGL-1 deficiency, T cell lymphopenia, and a reduced exit rate of T cells from the thymus. We have shown previously that PSGL-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> T cells have &#x0223c;10% reduced homing to the spleen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>); although this reduced homing capacity may marginally skew determination of the thymic exit rate of PSGL-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> T cells, it is unlikely to translate in the 50% reduced exit rate we have determined for these cells.</p><p>We identified S1P as a potential mediator translating changes in the peripheral lymphocyte pool into altered thymic TCP receptivity. The phospholipid S1P is known to activate the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway through the S1P<sub>3</sub> receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>) and to induce transcription of cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules, including P-selectin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>). Using the mouse endothelial cell line bend.3, we showed that S1P has an opposing dose-dependent effect on P-selectin expression, in agreement with a previous study performed on human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>), suggesting that S1P might act directly on endothelial cells and that the effects we observed in vivo are not caused by indirect effects. The observation that DOP treatment also inhibits thymic TCP receptivity suggests that local S1P gradients modulate TCP importation. Furthermore, our findings expand the known pharmacological activities of DOP and FTY720, but the physiological consequences of prolonged drug treatment remain to be investigated.</p><p>The finding that boosting or depleting peripheral lymphocyte numbers correlated with rapid changes in plasma S1P levels suggests that peripheral lymphocytes and S1P metabolism interact. However, it remains to be determined whether lymphoyctes directly or indirectly modulate S1P level. Our data also show that S1P levels in lymphopenic IL-7R<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and RAG-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice were not increased compared with WT mice, which seems to contradict the data from the boost/depletion experiments. We favor the explanation that compensatory mechanisms described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>) might lead to normal S1P levels in those mice. P-selectin or PSGL-1 deficiency is associated with altered blood S1P levels, indicating that the presence of these molecules is important in S1P homeostasis. It has been shown that P-selectin&#x02013;deficient mice have an increased level of plasma high-density lipoprotein (HDL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>). Because HDL binds free S1P, thereby protecting it from degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>), the increased S1P level we observe in Psel<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice could be explained by increased plasma HDL. Furthermore, the phenotype of PSGL-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice is to some degree reminiscent of the phenotype of sphingosine-kinase&#x02013;deficient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>) in that both knockout strains have reduced S1P plasma levels and a corresponding increased S1P<sub>1</sub> expression on T cells, reduced thymic output, and reduced numbers of circulating T cells, whereas T cells in lymph nodes and spleens are normal. Collectively, these findings suggest a possible interaction between S1P metabolism and the P-selectin&#x02013;PSGL-1 axis. However, the exact nature of this mechanism needs to be further investigated.</p><p>Boost/depletion experiments revealed a surprisingly rapid feedback mechanism in the regulation of thymic TCP entry. We hypothesize that boosting or depleting the peripheral T cell pool leads to increased cell stress that in turn could trigger an acute reaction leading to altered S1P level. In support of this hypothesis are the findings that S1P levels change under stress situation and inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>). Furthermore, the observation that hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells also respond to S1P gradients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref>) suggests a potential bifunctional role of S1P in modulating thymic TCP receptivity by altering adhesion molecule expression on the thymic endothelium and by modulating the migration pattern of hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, including TCPs.</p><p>How can lymphocytes, which are only marginally involved in S1P production or degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref>), induce short-term changes in S1P levels? There is clear evidence that erythrocytes are one major source for plasma S1P, and although genetic evidence is still lacking, there are strong indications that endothelial cells are also involved in S1P homeostasis by removing S1P from circulation and/or releasing it into circulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref>). Although they do not produce S1P, platelets have been shown to store and release large amounts of S1P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref>) and may thus contribute to S1P homeostasis. We hypothesize that lymphocytes indirectly modulate S1P production or degradation by cytokine release or by direct interaction with cells that control S1P homeostasis. Interaction of peripheral lymphocytes with thymic endothelial cell&#x02013;expressed P-selectin and, thus, a direct signaling through thymic P-selectin can, however, be excluded as a possible feedback mechanism, as resting peripheral lymphocytes do not express functional P-selectin ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref>).</p><p>Based on our data, we propose a model in which thymic Psel/CCL25 expression and, consequently, thymic TCP receptivity are controlled by two feedback mechanisms. The first mechanism active under homeostatic conditions triggers a feedback signal from the thymic perivascular region, depending on the quantity and possibly also the quality of immigrated ETPs. This intrathymic signal regulates the periodicity of thymic P-selectin and CCL25 expression. Mouse strains with reduced ETP numbers, such as IL-7R<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>, RAG-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>, PSGL-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>, and C2GnT1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, have no periodic expression in thymic P-selectin and CCL25. The second mechanism triggers a feedback signal depending on the size of the peripheral lymphocyte pool and is active especially under acute conditions affecting the intensity of Psel/CCL25 expression. The thymic vascular gates thus integrate both feedback signals and control the entry of new TCPs into the thymus by adjusting the amount and periodicity of expression of recruitment molecules on thymic endothelial cells. These results provide new insights into the mechanisms that regulate periodic TCP importation into the thymus and demonstrate that the thymus responds to internal and external cues to regulate T cell formation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title/><sec><title>Mice.</title><p>C57BL/6 (CD45.2), congenic C57BL/6 (CD45.1), PSGL-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> (B6.Cg-Selplg<sup>tm1Fur</sup>), Psel<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>, IL7R<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>, and RAG-1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, all backcrossed onto a C57BL/6 background, were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory.

Labeling efficiency of thymocytes was, on average, 76%.</p></sec><sec><title>Intrathymic bone marrow injection.</title><p>Intrathymic bone marrow injection was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>). Two million WT bone marrow cells in 10 &#x000b5;l RPMI 1640 were injected into each thymic lobe of anesthetized mice using a Tridek Stepper. 10&#x02013;14 d after injection, chimerism was assessed by flow cytometry.</p></sec><sec><title>TREC analysis.</title><p>Assessment of TRECs was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">53</xref>). In brief, T cells from spleens were labeled with biotinylated anti-CD4 and -CD8 antibodies and purified using SA-coupled magnetic beads (Miltenyi Biotec), according to the manufacturer's instruction. After counting, the purified cells were put into TRIzol solution and processed according to the manufacturer's recommendations. After removing the aqueous phase, the DNA was extracted from the remaining interphase and organic phase using back extraction buffer (4 M guanidine thiocyanate, 50 mM sodium citrate, 1 M Tris). After phase separation by centrifugation, the DNA in the aqueous phase was precipitated using isopropanol and the DNA pellet was washed several times with 75% ethanol. The quantity and quality of the DNA was assessed using a Nanodrop spectrometer (ND-1000). Equal amounts of DNA were amplified with primers and detected with a fluorescent-labeled probe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">53</xref>) using the Probe Master Mix on an LC480 Lightcycler system (both from Roche). Absolute numbers of excision circles were determined using a calibration curve that was produced with known amounts of plasmids (Topo Vector; Invitrogen) containing the target sequence.</p></sec><sec><title>FTY720 and DOP treatment.</title><p>FTY720 (Cayman Chemical) stocks were prepared in DMSO and diluted in vehicle solution (PBS, 0.1% mouse serum) before injection. Mice received 1 mg/kg FTY720 or vehicle alone i.p. for three consecutive days and were analyzed 24 h after the last injection. Mice received 30 mg/liter DOP (4&#x02032;deoxypyridoxine; Sigma-Aldrich) in drinking water with 10 g/liter glucose for 3 d (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>). After FTY720 or DOP treatment, one cohort was sacrificed to analyze thymic P-selectin RNA expression, S1P level, and thymocyte subset distribution. The second cohort received a congenic bone marrow transplant to test for thymic receptivity, as described. Thymic chimerism was assessed 3 wk after bone marrow injection.</p></sec><sec><title>Bone marrow transfer.</title><p>Bone marrow was extracted from respective congenic mice by flushing femurs and tibias with RPMI 1640, 2% FCS, 2 mM EDTA. After red blood cell lysis, 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> cells in HBSS were injected i.v. into recipients. 3 wk later, thymi, lymph nodes, and spleens were harvested and analyzed for chimerism based on congenic markers (CD45.1 and CD45.2).</p></sec><sec><title>In vivo T cell depletion.</title><p>In vivo T cell depletion was performed by i.p. injection of 0.5 mg anti-CD4 and -CD8 antibodies in PBS. Control mice received PBS only. After 24 h, mice were sacrificed to analyze peripheral T cell numbers, P-selectin RNA level, and S1P level. For testing thymic TCP receptivity, mice received 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> congenic bone marrow cells 2 d after antibody injection. Thymic chimerism was assessed 3 wk after bone marrow transfer using flow cytometry.</p></sec><sec><title>S1P dose&#x02013;response using the bend.3 endothelial cell line.</title><p>The mouse endothelial cell line bend.3 (American Type Culture Collection), previously described to express P-selectin and S1PR1 and S1PR2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">55</xref>), was cultured in high-glucose DMEM containing 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 0.1 mM of nonessential amino acids, 1,000 U penicillin/streptomycin, and 10% FCS (all from Invitrogen). For the dose&#x02013;response assay, 50,000 bend.3 cells seeded per well of a 24-well plate (BD) were allowed to adhere overnight, washed several times with serum-free media containing 4% of fatty acid&#x02013;free BSA (EMD). Cells were cultured for 12 h in serum-free media (+4% of fatty acid&#x02013;free BSA) containing S1P (Cayman Chemical) at the indicated concentration. Control cells were maintained in serum-free media (+4% of fatty acid&#x02013;free BSA). Cells were lysed using TRIzol and RNA was extracted according to the manufacturer's instructions (see Real-time PCR).</p></sec><sec><title>Statistics.</title><p>Data are presented as mean values and error bars are presented as SEM.
