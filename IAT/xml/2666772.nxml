While AND-34 is widely expressed in wild type mice, histologic analysis of multiple organs in AND-34<bold><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></bold> mice is unremarkable and analyses of lymphocyte development show no overt changes. A small percentage of AND-34<bold><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></bold> mice show distinctive small white eye lesions resulting from the migration of ruptured cortical lens tissue into the anterior chamber.

Interest in this protein has focused on the ability of BCAR3 (Breast Cancer Anti-Estrogen Resistance 3), the human homolog of AND-34, to induce anti-estrogen resistance in breast cancer in concert with p130Cas (BCAR1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>]. Expression of the BCAR3/p130Cas complex is generally higher in mesenchymal than epithelial breast cancer cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>]. Overexpression of AND-34/BCAR3 in epithelial cells induces high levels of extracellular fibronectin deposition as well as increased migration and colocalization with p130CAS at the cell membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>]. Conversely, depletion of AND-34/BCAR3 in mesenchymal breast cancer cells by RNA interference inhibits cell migration and invasiveness and relocalizes p130CAS away from the membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>]. These studies have served to highlight the role of AND-34/BCAR3 and p130Cas in cell adhesion and migration signaling pathways.</p><p>AND-34/BCAR3 is a member of the NSP (novel SH2-containing protein) family of proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>]. While NSP1 is expressed in humans but not mice, NSP2 (AND-34/BCAR3) and NSP3 (CHAT [Cas/HEF1-associated signal transducer]/SHEP [SH2 domain-containing Eph receptor-binding protein 1]) are expressed in both species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>]. All NSP proteins contain an NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal SH2 (Src homology domain 2) domain, a central proline/serine-rich domain, and a COOH-terminal domain with modest homology to Ras subfamily GDP-exchange factors (GEFs). In each case, there is association with p130CAS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>] or the related p130CAS family members HEF1 or Sin (Src interacting) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>]. Just how much functional redundancy exists among the NSP homologs has not been well studied, although various splice variants have been reported in the same breast cancer cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>]. However, one study recently identified AND-34/BCAR3 but very little NSP3 or NSP1 protein in human breast cancer lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>].</p><p>As NSP family members contain a GEF-like domain, several studies have examined whether NSP proteins activate Ras subfamily GTPases. While initial transfection studies using chimeric GST (glutathione-S-transferase)-GTPase assays suggested that AND-34 could activate Ral, Rap1, and R-Ras [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>] and recent structural studies confirm that the AND-34 COOH-terminus has a Cdc25-like GEF fold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>], subsequent studies using pull-down assays have not detected robust activation of these GTPases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>]. In those studies that did identify activation of Rap1 by the murine NSP3 member CHAT, activation was likely indirect through activation of the p130Cas-associated Rap1 GEF C3G [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>]. In contrast to the generally negative results with Ras subfamily GTPases, overexpression of AND-34 in epithelial or lymphoid cell lines reproducibly activates the Rho subfamily GTPases, Rac and Cdc42 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>]. Not surprisingly, given the absence of a Dbl-like Rho subfamily GEF domain, the ability of AND-34 to activate Cdc42 and Rac is indirect and apparently dependent on PI3K (phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase) activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>]. Such PI3K dependent signaling in AND-34 overexpressing cells also induces the activation of Akt kinase as judged by serine 473 phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>].</p><p>Among the three NSP family members, only AND-34/BCAR3 induces anti-estrogen resistance in estrogen receptor (ER&#x003b1;)-positive breast cancer cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>]. Surprisingly, although Rac activation has been implicated in anti-estrogen resistance in breast cancer cells, activation of Rac or Cdc42 by AND-34 is insufficient to induce anti-estrogen resistance as overexpression of any of the three NSP family members activates these GTPases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>]. More recent comparison studies demonstrated that among the three NSP family members, AND-34 induces the most robust serine phosphorylation of p130Cas (unpublished communication). The physiologic consequences of AND-34-mediated p130Cas serine phosphorylation remain a subject of active investigation.</p><p>Given the possibility that disruption of the AND-34/p130Cas complex might be therapeutically beneficial in anti-estrogen refractory breast cancer, we sought to establish the normal physiologic role of AND-34 by using homologous recombination to eliminate expression of AND-34 in mice. Here, we report that while AND-34<bold><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></bold> mice are healthy and fertile, they display an unusual ocular lens phenotype. In an age-dependent fashion and with very high penetrance, AND-34<bold><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></bold> mice undergo rupture of the lens capsule with occasional migration of a portion of the extruded lens into the anterior or posterior chamber of the eye. Imaging and biochemical studies demonstrate that AND-34 is expressed in the equatorial lens epithelium and that disruption of AND-34-mediated signaling in this cell type results in disruption of lens fiber organization. Shortly after birth, analysis of AND-34<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice reveals cortical lens vacuolization and liquefaction followed several weeks later by rupture of the posterior lens capsule.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Lambda phage clones containing <italic>AND-34</italic></title><p>A phage library representing the 129 mouse genome (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was screened for <italic>AND-34</italic> inserts using the entire cDNA sequence as a hybridization probe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>].

Further, among those in which the genetic locus has been identified, the degree of lens rupture has not typically been as severe as that observed in AND-34<bold><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></bold> mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">33</xref>]. A strain of mice with a spontaneously occurring recessive &#x0201c;lens rupture&#x0201d; (lr) mutation were reported in 1950 and has some characteristics similar to AND-34<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref>]. This albino strain of mice had posterior rupture of the entire nucleus of the lens with 100% phenotypic penetrance at three months. In striking similarity to AND-34<bold><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></bold> mice, either the displaced nucleus or the remaining soft degenerate lens passed into the anterior chamber in 18% of cases. In a second strain of mice reported in 1963, a radiation-induced &#x0201c;ectopic&#x0201d; (ec) lens rupture mutation resulted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref>]. Unfortunately, the genetic basis for the lr and ec phenotypes was never established, and both strains of mice are now extinct. Secreted protein rich in cysteine (SPARC) is a matricellular protein whose elimination results in lens opacity at one month of age and cataract formation and lens capsule rupture at seven to eight months of age. However, overall, the severity of the SPARC<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> phenotype appears considerably less than that observed in AND-34<bold><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></bold> mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r34">34</xref>]. Loss of Abi2, a member of the Abl-interactor family of adaptor proteins, results in abnormal lens fiber orientation during development, failure of anterior and posterior lens suture formation, and posterior lens rupture at postnatal day 1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r35">35</xref>]. We have not observed major abnormalities in lens fiber orientation or suture formation in AND-34<bold><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></bold> mice, suggesting that the rupture may not occur as a result of improper alignment of developing lens fibers.</p><p>Since the first lens abnormality observed is cortical lens fiber vacuolization followed by lens fiber liquefaction, we hypothesize that disruption of normal focal adhesion complex dynamics in AND-34<bold><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></bold> lens epithelial cells and their differentiated progeny result in defective adhesion between lens fibers. Cortical lens fiber vacuolization and liquefaction is eventually followed by lens capsule rupture and extrusion of cortical lens material into the posterior chamber of the eye. As is the case with most prior reports, lens rupture in AND-34<bold><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></bold> mice occurs posteriorly where the capsule is weakest. The lens capsule is one of the thickest basement membranes in the body and is composed of collagen, laminin, fibronectin, entactin-1, and sulfated proteoglycans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r36">36</xref>]. The capsular matrix is produced and remodeled throughout life by lens epithelial cells anteriorly and by the basal ends of elongating fibers posteriorly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r37">37</xref>]. As overexpression of AND-34 augments fibronectin deposition in breast cancer epithelial cell lines, we also hypothesize that loss of AND-34 in lens epithelial cells alters the composition and strength of the lens capsule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>]. Of note, since other animal models of cataract characterized by fiber breakdown do not necessarily undergo capsular rupture, it would appear that the altered synthesis of the lens capsule is likely to play a pivotal role in the lens rupture observed in AND-34<bold><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></bold> mice. As lens fibers elongate, they maintain an apical cell-cell interaction with lens epithelial cells and a posterior cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) interaction with the lens capsule. Given that we observe an extrusion of ruptured cortical material posteriorly, loss of AND-34 may dysregulate lens fiber interaction with and maintenance of the posterior lens capsule.</p><p>Our observation that loss of <italic>AND-34</italic> expression leads to the rupture of the adult lens is unexpected and suggests that interaction of AND-34 with other components of the focal adhesion complex plays a non-redundant role in maintaining the integrity of the lens. Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) transmits signals from integrins to the p130Cas complex by binding to the p130Cas SH3 domain. FAK expression in the adult lens is restricted to those areas where lens epithelial cells exit the cell cycle and initiate differentiation (posterior germinative zone and transitional zone, respectively) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r38">38</xref>]. FAK is also present in the basal membrane complex of lens fiber cells where they attach to the lens capsule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r39">39</xref>]. FAK in turn regulates Src-mediated regulation of p130Cas signaling. Src family kinases bind by their SH2 domains to the FAK Y397 autophosphorylation site, facilitating Src kinase activation and subsequent Src-mediated phosphorylation of multiple tyrosine motifs in the substrate domain of p130Cas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r40">40</xref>]. Similar to the studies noted above with FAK, activated Src (phospho-Y527) is selectively observed in equatorial lens epithelia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r41">41</xref>]. Our studies suggest that loss of AND-34 leads to lens rupture as a result of altered p130Cas complex signaling in the same equatorial lens epithelial population identified as the site of lens-associated FAK and Src signaling. Western blot analysis confirms <italic>AND-34</italic> expression in lens epithelial cells and to a lesser extent in lens fiber cells when normalized for total protein loaded. In situ hybridization demonstrates that within the lens epithelium, the predominant site of <italic>AND-34</italic> expression is at the lens equator. Altered PAGE mobility of p130Cas in preparations derived from AND-34<bold><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></bold> mice is consistent with reduced p130Cas phosphorylation. However, while most studies of p130Cas have focused on Src-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of the p130Cas substrate domain, our own recent studies suggest that AND-34 regulates p130Cas serine phosphorylation (unpublished observation). Given limitations in the amount of protein we could obtain from primary AND-34<bold><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></bold> lens epithelia, studies with cultured lens epithelial cells from wild type and AND-34<bold><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></bold> mice will be required to confirm whether loss of AND-34 does in fact reduce lens epithelial p130Cas serine phosphorylation as well as the functional implications of such reduced phosphorylation. As the absence of <italic>AND-34</italic> transcript expression in lens fibers is an expected consequence of the general loss of transcripts from such cells and as we detect AND-34 protein expression in lens fibers by western blot analysis, it remains possible that loss of <italic>AND-34</italic> expression has an important impact on lens fiber function as well as lens epithelial cell function.</p><p>AND-34 induced Rac activation in breast cancer epithelial cell lines is dependent upon PI3K activation, most likely as a result of activation of pleckstrin homology domain-containing Rac GEFs. The same AND-34 mediated PI3K activation is associated with Akt signaling as judged by Akt Ser 473 phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>]. Both PI3K itself and PI3K dependent Rac activation are known to play important roles in lens epithelial differentiation and survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>]. Rac activation antagonizes Rho, resulting in the disassembly of actin stress fibers, a critical event in lens epithelial cell differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r42">42</xref>]. Among PI3K effector proteins, Akt is required for IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor 1) mediated protection of lens epithelial cells from apoptotic stimuli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r43">43</xref>]. PI3K signaling and Akt has also been implicated in differentiation of lens epithelial cells into secondary fiber cells in response to vitreal factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r45">45</xref>]. To examine whether an AND-34 dependent PI3K signaling pathway might be active in murine lens epithelia, we examined levels of Akt Ser 473 phosphorylation in lens epithelial lysates from wild type and AND-34<bold><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></bold> mice. Akt Ser473 phosphorylation was markedly diminished in lysates derived from AND-34 null mice despite conservation of total levels of Akt. These results support the hypothesis that loss of AND-34 disrupts a PI3K and Rac-mediated signaling pathway required for appropriate differentiation of lens epithelial cells. Further studies of AND-34 dependent PI3K and Rac signaling in cultured lens cells should help to elucidate the relationship of such signaling to lens rupture in AND-34<bold><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></bold> mice.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Our study was supported by the National Institute of Health (RO1 CA114094) and by the Logica Foundation.
