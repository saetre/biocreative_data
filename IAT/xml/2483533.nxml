Epithelial-mesenchymal transition is essential during embryogenesis for the formation of many tissues, including the formation of the mesoderm, the migration of neural crest cells, and the development of the heart valves and septa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hay, 2005</xref>). Endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a specific form of epithelial-mesenchymal transition that is initiated at embryonic day (E)&#x02013;9.5 in the atrioventricular (AV) canal and E10.5 in the outflow tract (OFT) cardiac cushions, the two sites of EMT in the developing heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Camenisch et al., 2002a</xref>). This process generates cells that contribute to the connective tissue of the valves and septa of the adult heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Eisenberg and Markwald, 1995</xref>).</p><p>Recent studies have demonstrated a critical role of the Notch signaling pathway during cardiac EMT, and disruption of this pathway has been implicated in the pathogenesis of various cardiovascular diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Iso et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Niessen and Karsan, 2007</xref>). In the mouse, targeted deletion of <italic>Notch1</italic> or its key nuclear partner <italic>CSL</italic> (<italic>CBF1/Suppressor of Hairless/Lag-1</italic>) results in cardiac cushion EMT defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Oka et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Timmerman et al., 2004</xref>). Further, targeted deletion of the downstream Notch/CSL effector <italic>Hey2</italic> or double-deficiency of <italic>Hey1</italic> and <italic>Hey2</italic> or <italic>Hey1</italic> and <italic>HeyL</italic> results in various congenital heart anomalies including cardiac cushion defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Donovan et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fischer et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">2007</xref>). In humans, mutations at the <italic>Notch1</italic> locus are associated with bicuspid aortic valve disease as well as mitral valve anomalies and tetralogy of Fallot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Garg et al., 2005</xref>). Further, patients with mutations of the Notch ligand Jagged1 develop Alagille syndrome, a polymalformative disorder which includes cardiac cushion defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Oda et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Eldadah et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>TGF-&#x003b2;&#x02013;related pathways have also been shown to be essential for proper heart development through their role in regulating EMT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Azhar et al., 2003</xref>). Of particular interest, <italic>BMP2</italic> and <italic>TGF-&#x003b2;2</italic> are expressed by the AV canal cushion myocardium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dickson et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhang and Bradley, 1996</xref>). BMP2-deficient mice die before cardiac cushion development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhang and Bradley, 1996</xref>); however, deficiency of the BMP2 receptor Alk2 results in AV canal EMT defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wang et al., 2005</xref>). <italic>TGF-&#x003b2;2</italic>&#x02013;deficient mouse embryos do not display obvious cardiac cushion EMT defects, although later remodeling of the AV canal cushion is impaired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dickson et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sanford et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bartram et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Molin et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">2003</xref>). However, using an ex vivo AV canal explant assay, TGF-&#x003b2;2&#x02013;blocking antibodies or blocking antibodies for its coreceptor <italic>T&#x003b2;RIII</italic> inhibit AV canal EMT, suggesting redundancy of this pathway in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brown et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Camenisch et al., 2002a</xref>). These data and others have established a clear role of TGF-&#x003b2;&#x02013;related pathways during mammalian cardiac cushion development.</p><p>The Snail family members <italic>Snail</italic> (also known as <italic>Snai1</italic>) and <italic>Slug</italic> (also known as <italic>Snai2</italic>) encode zinc finger&#x02013;containing transcriptional repressors that trigger EMT during embryonic development and tumor progression, in part by regulating expression of junctional proteins, most notably <italic>E-cadherin</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nieto, 2002</xref>). In the mouse, <italic>Snail</italic> has been shown to be expressed in the cardiac cushions from E9.5 onwards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Timmerman et al., 2004</xref>). Mice deficient for <italic>Snail</italic> die at E7.5, before cardiac development, and display defects in mesoderm formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carver et al., 2001</xref>). Conditional deletion of <italic>Snail</italic> after E8 results in lethality by E9.5, partially because of severe cardiovascular defects, but before the initiation of cardiac cushion EMT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Murray and Gridley, 2006</xref>). In the mouse, Slug is expressed in the cardiac cushions at E13.5, and mice deficient for <italic>Slug</italic> are viable but are growth retarded and display defects in pigmentation and hematopoiesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jiang et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Inoue et al., 2002</xref>). To date, there is no direct evidence demonstrating the requirement for any Snail family member during mammalian heart development.</p><p>In this paper, we demonstrate that <italic>Slug</italic> is first expressed by a subset of endothelial cells as well as mesenchymal cells of the AV canal at E9.5, at the initiation of EMT. In keeping with a requirement for Slug during the initiation of cardiac EMT, the AV canal cushions show markedly reduced cellularization at E9.5, which normalizes by E10.5. Concordant with the in vivo findings, AV canal explant assays demonstrate that EMT in <italic>Slug</italic>-deficient embryos is impaired at E9.5 but not E10.5, as EMT in <italic>Slug</italic>-deficient embryos is rescued by an increase in <italic>Snail</italic> expression by E10.5. Accordingly, abolishing both <italic>Slug</italic> and <italic>Snail</italic> expression results in EMT defects at E10.5. In contrast to a previous study, we show that Notch signaling, through CSL, directly regulates the <italic>Slug</italic> promoter, resulting in the up-regulation of <italic>Slug</italic>, but not <italic>Snail</italic>, in endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Timmerman et al., 2004</xref>). We further show that <italic>Slug</italic> directly binds and represses the <italic>vascular endothelial cadherin</italic> (<italic>VE-cadherin</italic>) promoter. Slug also promotes increased migration toward PDGF. In contrast, TGF-&#x003b2;2 and BMP2 induce <italic>Snail</italic> expression but minimal <italic>Slug</italic> expression. However, Notch synergistically induces <italic>Snail</italic> in concert with TGF-&#x003b2;2. Our data demonstrate that Notch-induced expression of <italic>Slug</italic> plays an important role in the initiation of EMT in the heart but that increased Snail compensates for the lack of Slug in <italic>Slug</italic>-targeted embryos as cardiac cushion morphogenesis progresses.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Activation of the Notch pathway induces <italic>Slug</italic> but not <italic>Snail</italic> in endothelial cells</title><p>It has previously been suggested that EMT initiated by Notch may proceed through the induction of Snail; however, the degenerate primers used in that study amplify both Snail and Slug (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Timmerman et al., 2004</xref>). To clarify which Snail family members are regulated by Notch signaling, we activated Notch in endothelial cells by ectopically expressing the Notch ligands Jagged1 or Dll4 or the constitutively active form of Notch1 or Notch4 (Notch1ICD and Notch4ICD, respectively), all of which are expressed in the cardiac cushion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Loomes et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Noseda et al., 2004</xref>). Activated Notch up-regulated <italic>Slug</italic>, but not <italic>Snail</italic>, in all endothelial cells tested, as demonstrated by RT-PCR (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>), quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>), and immunoblotting (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, C and D</xref>; and see <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 B</xref>). As a positive control, we confirmed that the known Notch targets <italic>Hey1</italic>, <italic>Hey2</italic>, and <italic>HeyL</italic> were induced by NotchICD (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, A and B</xref>). Additional experiments with NotchICD deletion constructs revealed that the Ankyrin repeats of Notch are required for induction of Slug (Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200710067/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200710067/DC1</ext-link>).

To investigate the reason for the normalization of cardiac cushion cellularization by E10.5, the degree of cardiac cushion apoptosis and proliferation was evaluated. AV canal endocardial and mesenchymal cell proliferation was measured by BrdU incorporation and no difference in S-phase entry was noted at E9.5 (unpublished data).

This synergistic activation of TGF-&#x003b2;&#x02013;induced <italic>Snail</italic> by Notch is consistent with the decrease in <italic>Snail</italic> expression seen in <italic>CSL</italic>-deficient embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Timmerman et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, endothelial-specific gene targeting of the BMP receptor <italic>Alk2</italic> results in cardiac cushion defects that are associated with a decrease in the expression of <italic>Snail</italic>, but not <italic>Hey2</italic> or <italic>Slug</italic>, in the AV canal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wang et al., 2005</xref>). In contrast, Notch-mediated EMT is cell autonomous and TGF-&#x003b2; independent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Noseda et al., 2004</xref>). Collectively, these findings support the data presented herein that <italic>Slug</italic> is a direct target of the Notch pathway and that <italic>Snail</italic> is a target of TGF-&#x003b2;&#x02013;related pathways.</p><p>We show for the first time that <italic>Slug</italic> is expressed in a subset of cardiac endothelial cells and the mesenchyme of the AV canal and OFT from the onset of EMT at E9.5 and is essential for initiating cardiac cushion cellularization. We further demonstrate that Slug binds and represses the <italic>VE-cadherin</italic> promoter, inducing a motile phenotype. Taken with the defect in AV canal EMT at E9.5, the ability of Slug to bind and repress the <italic>VE-cadherin</italic> promoter and induce migration suggests that the activation phase of EMT in the endocardium is impaired by loss of <italic>Slug</italic>.</p><p>Using an AV canal explant model, we demonstrate that <italic>Slug</italic>-deficient hearts have a specific defect in cardiac cushion EMT at E9.5 but not at E10.5. In <italic>Slug</italic>-deficient hearts at E10.5, cardiac EMT is compensated for by a relative increase in <italic>Snail</italic> expression. Accordingly, inducing <italic>Snail</italic> expression by treatment with TGF-&#x003b2;2 at E9.5 rescues the EMT defect in <italic>Slug</italic>-deficient mice. Conversely, abolishing both <italic>Slug</italic> and <italic>Snail</italic> expression results in EMT defects at E10.5. Consistent with a requirement for both <italic>Snail</italic> and <italic>Slug</italic> during cardiac EMT, both members are expressed during mouse and human heart development with similar localization in a subset of endothelial cells and the mesenchymal cells of the AV canal and OFT. It is of interest that deletion of <italic>Slug</italic> results in up-regulation of <italic>Snail</italic>. This finding suggests that <italic>Slug</italic> may act to repress <italic>Snail</italic>, either by directly targeting the <italic>Snail</italic> promoter or through the repression of elements of the TGF-&#x003b2;&#x02013;related or Notch pathways. Consistent with the latter hypothesis, we have seen that both <italic>Hey2</italic> and <italic>Smad7</italic> are up-regulated in <italic>Slug</italic>-deficient hearts at E11.5 (unpublished data). Additionally, it has been demonstrated that Slug does not affect <italic>Snail</italic>-promoter activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Peiro et al., 2006</xref>), which we have verified (unpublished data). Our findings are concordant with a recent study showing that Snail heterozygosity increases the penetrance of palate defects in Slug-deficient mice, suggesting that Snail also compensates for Slug deficiency during palate development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Murray et al., 2007</xref>). In addition, the finding that there is increased <italic>Slug</italic> expression in the developing palate in <italic>Snail</italic>-deficient embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Murray et al., 2007</xref>) suggests reciprocal regulation of gene expression between <italic>Slug</italic> and <italic>Snail</italic>.</p><p>The interaction between the Notch and TGF-&#x003b2; pathways likely occurs at multiple levels and may be context-dependent. Targeting of <italic>CSL</italic> results in reduced <italic>TGF-&#x003b2;2</italic> and its receptor <italic>TBRII</italic> in the mouse heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Timmerman et al., 2004</xref>). In contrast, the Notch-ligand <italic>Jagged1</italic> has been shown to be induced by TGF-&#x003b2; at the onset of EMT in epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zavadil et al., 2004</xref>). Despite our evidence showing cooperation of the TGF-&#x003b2; and Notch pathways in cardiac cushion development, several studies have suggested that constitutively active NotchICD inhibits TGF-&#x003b2; signaling through the sequestration of Smad3 or the coactivator p300 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Masuda et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sun et al., 2005</xref>). However, overexpression of NotchICD may have resulted in artifactual sequestering of TGF-&#x003b2; signaling components. Alternatively, the outcome of Notch&#x02013;TGF-&#x003b2; cross talk may be dependent on the context. Indeed, in mouse embryonic endothelial cells, BMP signaling synergizes with NotchICD through a ternary interaction between Smad5, NotchICD, and p/CAF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Itoh et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Combining the findings in this paper with published data, one can propose a model where endothelial Notch activation induces <italic>Slug</italic> and release of TGF-&#x003b2; and BMPs from the cushion myocardium activates the cardiac endothelium to up-regulate <italic>Snail</italic>, which is enhanced in Notch-activated cells. Based on the <italic>Slug</italic>-deficient hearts and RNAi studies in the AV explants, a minimal total dose of <italic>Snail</italic>/<italic>Slug</italic> is required in order for EMT to be initiated at E9.5, with a diminishing requirement at E10.5 as cushion development proceeds.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Reagents</title><p>The mouse monoclonal antibody against the FLAG epitope (M2), mouse anti&#x02013;h1-calponin, and mouse anti-tubulin were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
