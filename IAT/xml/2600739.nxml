This migration of leukocytes occurs in a multistep process that involves cognate interactions between circulating cells and the vascular wall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ley et al., 2007</xref>). The first interactive step mediated by selectins results in rolling of the leukocytes along the vascular endothelium. Exposure of leukocytes to chemokines released and presented by inflamed tissues triggers the activation of leukocyte integrins. Activated integrins therefore engage ligands on vascular endothelial cells to mediate firm adhesion of leukocytes to the vessel wall and their movement toward interendothelial junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schenkel et al., 2004</xref>). These steps precede the diapedesis of the leukocytes from the vascular lumen into the surrounding tissue by migrating through junctions between endothelial cells, and in some cases, by migrating through the endothelial cell body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Vestweber, 2007</xref>).</p><p>Several endothelial adhesion molecules act as leukocyte integrin ligands and are involved in leukocyte migration. Leukocyte firm adhesion is mediated by the interaction of endothelial vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) with the integrin &#x003b1;<sub>4</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> (VLA-4) and of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 and -2 (ICAM-1 and ICAM-2) with the integrins &#x003b1;<sub>L</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>2</sub> (LFA-1) and &#x003b1;<sub>M</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>2</sub> (Mac-1). In addition, the members of the junctional adhesion molecule (JAM) family expressed by endothelial cells have been proposed to constitute other leukocyte integrin ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bazzoni, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ebnet et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Weber et al., 2007</xref>). The JAM protein family consists of three members: JAM-A, JAM-B, and JAM-C, which are Ig superfamily molecules with two extracellular Ig domains and a short cytoplasmic tail ending with a type II PDZ-binding motif. The prototypical member of the family, JAM-A, was initially described as a tight junction molecule expressed by endothelial and epithelial cells and involved in monocyte migration in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Martin-Padura et al., 1998</xref>). JAM-A binds the leukocyte integrin LFA-1 and regulates the adhesion and transmigration of lymphocytes in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ostermann et al., 2002</xref>). In addition, JAM-A is expressed by leukocytes, platelets, and erythrocytes. The two other members of the family, JAM-B and JAM-C, were described as endothelial adhesion molecules highly expressed by high endothelial venules and lymphatic endothelial cells in lymphoid organs, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cunningham et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Palmeri et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arrate et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aurrand-Lions et al., 2001</xref>). Endothelial JAM-C can promote lymphocyte migration through homophilic interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Johnson-Leger et al., 2002</xref>) and is involved in neutrophil transendothelial migration by interacting with Mac-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chavakis et al., 2004</xref>). In addition, JAM-C has been shown to be expressed on human leukocytes and to interact with JAM-B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arrate et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Liang et al., 2002</xref>), an interaction that facilitates the binding of endothelial JAM-B to the integrin VLA-4 expressed on lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cunningham et al., 2002</xref>). Therefore, JAM family members seem to facilitate leukocyte transmigration by interacting in trans with the leukocyte &#x003b2;2 integrins LFA-1 and Mac-1, as well as with the &#x003b2;1 integrin VLA-4, through their extracellular domains, and by engaging in heterophilic interactions in trans among JAM family members.</p><p>Additional Ig superfamily members structurally related to the JAMs and potentially involved in leukocyte&#x02013;endothelial cell interactions have been identified: the coxsackie and adenovirus receptor (CAR), endothelial cell-selective adhesion molecule (ESAM), JAM-4, and JAM-L. CAR, ESAM, and JAM-4 molecules are expressed at endothelial and epithelial junctions and share a similar overall organization with JAMs: two Ig-like domains, a single transmembrane domain, and a longer cytoplasmic tail that ends in a canonical type I PDZ domain&#x02013;binding sequence. JAM-L, however, is expressed on leukocytes, and its cytoplasmic tail does not possess a PDZ-binding motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Moog-Lutz et al., 2003</xref>). ESAM is involved in the extravasation of neutrophils but not that of lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wegmann et al., 2006</xref>), and JAM-L can participate in neutrophil migration across epithelial tight junctions by interacting with CAR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zen et al., 2005</xref>). The molecular mechanisms by which JAM-L and other JAM-related molecules may facilitate the transmigration of specific leukocyte populations are still largely unresolved.</p><p>In this study, we found that JAM-L&#x02013;mediated leukocyte adhesion to endothelial cells is regulated in cis by VLA-4 integrin activation. We provide evidence that JAM-L expressed on neutrophils can directly interact with its cognate counter-receptor CAR independently of integrin activation. However, on resting monocytes and T lymphocytes, which, unlike neutrophils, express the integrin VLA-4, JAM-L constitutively associates with VLA-4. This interaction prevents the cis dimerization of JAM-L, which is required for the functional recognition of CAR. Integrin activation is thus necessary to dissociate JAM-L&#x02013;VLA-4 complexes and to promote the formation of JAM-L dimers. Our results demonstrate that the leukocyte integrin VLA-4 unexpectedly regulates JAM-L function in cis by controlling its dimerization state; they strongly suggest that VLA-4 integrin and JAM-L functions are coordinately regulated, allowing JAM-L to contribute to the strengthening of the integrin-dependent adhesion of leukocytes to endothelial cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>JAM-L expression is restricted to neutrophils, monocytes, and memory T cells</title><p>We previously identified JAM-L as a novel protein with homology to members of the JAM family. JAM-L mRNA was up-regulated in myeloid leukemia cells induced to differentiate through the granulocytic and monocytic pathways, and was expressed in normal hematopoietic cells, including neutrophils, monocytes, and lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Moog-Lutz et al., 2003</xref>). Using anti&#x02013;human JAM-L antibodies, we investigated JAM-L expression in freshly isolated human leukocytes and in cultured endothelial or epithelial cells. Consistent with the presence of JAM-L mRNA in leukocytes, JAM-L protein expression was detected at the surface of neutrophils, monocytes, and, to a lesser extent, human T lymphocytes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). However, JAM-L expression was not detected on human CD34<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> hematopoietic stem cells and progenitors freshly isolated from umbilical cord blood (unpublished data). In addition, neither JAM-L protein (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>) nor mRNA expression (not depicted) were detected in a human bone marrow microvascular endothelial cell line; nor was it detected in endothelial or epithelial cells of different origins (primary cultures of human umbilical vein endothelial cells, saphenous vein endothelial cells, and dermal microvascular endothelial cells, as well as in the brain microvessel endothelial cell line hCMEC/D3 or the epithelial cells lines T84 and Caco-2; not depicted), which strongly suggests that, unlike any other JAMs and related molecules, human JAM-L expression is restricted to mature leukocytes.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>JAM-L expression is restricted to neutrophils, monocytes, and memory T cells.</bold> (A) Neutrophils, monocytes, and T lymphocytes freshly isolated from human peripheral blood and HBMECs stained with anti&#x02013;JAM-L and analyzed by flow cytometry.

Staining with antibodies to CD45RA and CD45RO isoforms of the leukocyte common antigen, which functionally identify distinct &#x0201c;naive&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;memory&#x0201d; T cell subsets, respectively, indicates that 90% of the JAM-L&#x02013;positive cells express CD45RO<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, whereas only 30% express CD45RA. In addition, 8&#x02013;15% express CD25<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and HLA-DR<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, two markers of the activated T cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). JAM-L was therefore mainly expressed on a large subpopulation of memory T cells (30&#x02013;35% of CD45RO<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells). Interestingly, JAM-L expression was predominant on <sc>l</sc>-selectin and CC-chemokine receptor 7&#x02013;negative T cells (CD62L<sup>&#x02212;</sup> and CCR7<sup>&#x02212;</sup>) that characterize a subpopulation of effector memory T cells, which preferentially migrate to peripheral tissues, as opposed to CD62L<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and CCR7<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> central memory T cells, which preferentially migrate to lymph nodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lefrancois, 2006</xref>). In addition, JAM-L was expressed on a fraction of T cells expressing the integrin &#x003b1;4&#x003b2;7 (associated with gut homing) and of T cells expressing the cutaneous leukocyte antigen (CLA) and CC-chemokine receptor 4 (CCR4; associated with skin homing).</p><p>Collectively, these findings indicate that JAM-L is selectively expressed by the first effectors of both innate and adaptative immune responses and strongly suggest that it may directly participate in the trafficking of memory T lymphocytes to nonlymphoid organs.</p></sec><sec><title>Cis dimerization of JAM-L is required to engage in heterophilic interactions with CAR</title><p>We previously found that exogenous expression of JAM-L in myeloid cells resulted in enhanced cell adhesion to both resting and cytokine-stimulated human bone marrow endothelial cells (HBMECs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Moog-Lutz et al., 2003</xref>). Interestingly, an interaction between JAM-L and epithelial CAR has been described supporting the transepithelial migration of neutrophils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zen et al., 2005</xref>). By expressing JAM-L in the human chronic myeloid leukemia cell line K562, which lacks endogenous JAM-L, we also observed that these cells adhere specifically to CAR (Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200805061/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200805061/DC1</ext-link>). Additionally, JAM-L&#x02013;mediated adhesion of K562 cells to HBMECs was prevented by the addition of soluble CAR protein (CAR-Fc chimeric molecules), which is consistent with the idea that JAM-L can promote leukocyte adhesion to endothelial cells by interacting with CAR (Fig. S1).</p><p>Crystal structures have revealed that JAM-A molecules form homodimers in cis via a dimerization motif in the membrane distal Ig-like domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kostrewa et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Prota et al., 2003</xref>). Moreover, Cis dimerization of JAM-A was shown to be required for homophilic interaction and function in intercellular junction assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bazzoni et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Liu et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mandell et al., 2004</xref>). As this dimerization motif is conserved between JAM members and JAM-L, we questioned whether JAM-L forms homodimers in cis. For this purpose, K562 cells were cotransfected with two constructs of JAM-L bearing different tags, JAM-L-GFP and JAM-L-HA, or cotransfected with JAM-L-HA and ICAM-1&#x02013;GFP, as a control. As shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>, JAM-L&#x02013;GFP was coimmunoprecipitated with JAM-L&#x02013;HA, and vice versa. However, no coimmunoprecipitation between JAM-L&#x02013;HA and ICAM-1&#x02013;GFP was observed, therefore specifically demonstrating that JAM-L is able to homodimerize.</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Cis-dimerization of JAM-L is required for its interaction with CAR.</bold> (A) K562 cells were double transfected with vectors encoding JAM-L&#x02013;HA and JAM-L&#x02013;GFP or with JAM-L&#x02013;HA and ICAM-1&#x02013;GFP.

Cells were then loaded with CMFDA, and adhesion assays were performed on immobilized CAR-Fc or CD25-Fc proteins in RPMI medium. Cells were incubated for 40 min at 37&#x000b0;C, adherent cells were lysed, and fluorescence intensity was measured.

As CAR binding to JAM-L is mediated by an interaction between the membrane-distal Ig domain of CAR and the membrane-proximal Ig domain of JAM-L (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zen et al., 2005</xref>), this mutation is unlikely to directly perturb the interaction. We have previously shown that this mutation abolished the ability of JAM-L to promote leukocyte adhesion to an endothelial monolayer when expressed in the monocytic U937 cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Moog-Lutz et al., 2003</xref>). Using K562 cells transfected with either JAM-L&#x02013;HA or JAM-L<sup>K54D</sup>&#x02013;HA, we show here that this point mutation also abolished JAM-L&#x02013;mediated adhesion to immobilized CAR-Fc (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>), although both proteins could be detected at the cell plasma membrane by flow cytometry (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>). Because JAM-A was shown to form SDS-resistant dimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Prota et al., 2003</xref>), we analyzed the ability of the K54D point mutation to inhibit JAM-L dimerization by immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting. After immunoprecipitation with an anti-HA antibody, a monomeric form of &#x0223c;48 kD was detected in immunocomplexes from K562 cells transfected with JAM-L&#x02013;HA or JAM-L<sup>K54D</sup>&#x02013;HA. In addition, when further exposed, minor bands of &#x0223c;100 kD corresponding to dimeric forms of JAM-L were detected from K562 cells expressing JAM-L but were barely visible in the case of JAM-L<sup>K54D</sup> (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D</xref>). Furthermore, using Bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate (BS<sup>3</sup>), a noncleavable, membrane-impermeable cross-linking agent, before cell lysis and analysis by Western blotting, we observed that 80&#x02013;90% of the JAM-L molecules present in K562 cells were stabilized in a dimeric form, whereas this proportion was decreased to 30&#x02013;35% by the K54D substitution. This, therefore, clearly shows that most of the JAM-L molecules form dimers at the membrane and that the K54D mutation affects the stabilization of JAM-L dimers. These results provide the first evidence of the importance of dimerization of JAM-related proteins to engage in heterophilic interactions.</p></sec><sec><title>JAM-L&#x02013;mediated adhesion of human monocytes or T lymphocytes, but not that of neutrophils, requires integrin activation</title><p>In characterizing the JAM-L&#x02013;dependent adhesion of leukocytes to endothelial cells, we routinely performed adhesion in RPMI medium containing the cations Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, and Mn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>.

We then questioned whether this effect was caused by the activation of monocytic or endothelial integrins. For that purpose, U937 cells that conditionally express JAM-L&#x02013;HA were further transiently transfected with either GFP alone (control) or with the head domain of talin coupled to GFP (Talin F23&#x02013;GFP) to directly activate integrins in those cells through an interaction with their &#x003b2; subunit cytoplasmic tails (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tadokoro et al., 2003</xref>).

These results demonstrate that the activation of a leukocyte integrin (not endothelial integrin) is required to reveal JAM-L function in U937 cells. This effect was not caused by any increase in &#x003b2;1 or &#x003b2;2 integrin expression, nor integrin activation caused by JAM-L expression (unpublished data).</p><p>Because previous work indicated that neutrophil adhesion to CAR can occur in a cation-independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zen et al., 2005</xref>), we then analyzed the contribution of the endogenous JAM-L to the adhesion of freshly isolated neutrophils and monocytes to immobilized CAR in PBS containing EDTA.

However, the addition of soluble JAM-L&#x02013;Fc did not affect the adhesion of freshly isolated monocytes to CAR (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 C</xref>) or of T lymphocytes (not depicted), which indicates that JAM-L does not support their adhesion in the absence of integrin activation.

Integrin activation upon SDF-1&#x003b1; treatment then restored the accumulation of most of the JAM-L molecules in a dimeric form (75&#x02013;85%). These results provide evidence that the inactive form of VLA-4 controls JAM-L function by preventing the formation of JAM-L dimers at the plasma membrane. However, it is interesting to note that BS<sup>3</sup> treatment did not increase the proportion of &#x003b1;4 associated with JAM-L (unpublished data), which suggests that the integrin may not be in close contact with JAM-L or may be indirectly associated with JAM-L.</p><p>All together, our results demonstrate that VLA-4 regulates JAM-L function in cis by controlling its dimerization state. This finding suggests a mechanism through which VLA-4 integrin and JAM-L functions are coordinately regulated, allowing JAM-L to strengthen the integrin-dependent adhesion of leukocytes to endothelial cells.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Leukocyte migration from the blood to tissues involves a series of molecular interactions between leukocyte and endothelial cell adhesion molecules. It is established that the activity of these adhesion molecules must be coordinated in time and space for proper leukocyte diapedesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ley et al., 2007</xref>). Our results here demonstrate an original regulation in cis of the leukocyte adhesion molecule JAM-L function by the integrin VLA-4. Integrin activation is required to promote JAM-L&#x02013;mediated leukocyte adhesion to endothelial cells, which suggests that these molecules are coordinately regulated to optimally support the adhesion and extravasation of leukocytes.</p><p>JAMs and related molecules are known to play multiple functions. Because of their expression on endothelial and epithelial cells, leukocytes, and platelets, JAMs contribute to adhesive interactions with circulating leukocytes and platelets, tight junction formation in epithelial and endothelial cells during the establishment of cell polarity, growth factor&#x02013;mediated angiogenesis, and vascular pathologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ebnet et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Weber et al., 2007</xref>). JAM-L is related to the JAM family and has particular structural and functional properties. JAM-L does not possess the canonical PDZ-binding motif present at the C terminus of the other JAM molecules and related members, which is essential for their function in the organization of tight junctions and cell polarity in epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ebnet et al., 2004</xref>). Unlike the other JAM family members, we did not find JAM-L expressed in various endothelial or epithelial cells. We present evidence here that JAM-L is expressed on neutrophils and monocytes, which are the first line of host defense against infection by bacterial pathogens. These cells are mobilized within hours to sites of inflammation, where they mediate bactericidal activity. In addition, we show that JAM-L is predominantly expressed on effector memory T cells, negative for the expression of <sc>l</sc>-selectin and the CC-chemokine receptor 7. This observation is of particular interest because this subset of memory T cells is known to migrate in nonlymphoid and mucosal sites, where they can immediately confront the invading pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lefrancois, 2006</xref>). Moreover, JAM-L is found on T cells expressing specific homing molecules involved in trafficking to the skin and the intestinal mucosa. This cellular distribution strongly suggests a major role of JAM-L in the recruitment to peripheral tissues of the first effectors of both innate and adaptative immune responses.</p><p>Our data suggest that JAM-L promotes leukocyte adhesion to endothelial cells by interacting with CAR. This protein, structurally related to the JAMs and best known as a receptor for coxsackie B and adenoviruses, is mainly expressed in polarized epithelia at the tight junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cohen et al., 2001</xref>). Adhesive interactions between CAR and JAM-L were shown to facilitate the transepithelial migration of neutrophils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zen et al., 2005</xref>). However, little is known about the tissue and cellular distribution of CAR in human vasculature. Future studies will determine whether JAM-L interaction with endothelial CAR may facilitate the firm adhesion or transmigration of specific leukocyte populations at specific sites. In addition, our data suggest that CAR may also promote the adhesion of monocytes and T lymphocytes through an interaction with another leukocyte receptor that remains to be identified.</p><p>The most striking result of the present study is the observation that JAM-L&#x02013;mediated adhesion of leukocytes to endothelial cells is regulated in cis by the activation state of the VLA-4 integrin. Until now, evidence has been provided of a functional crosstalk between leukocyte adhesion molecules and integrins, promoting the controlled activation of specific integrins at defined steps during the leukocyte adhesion cascade: E- and <sc>l</sc>-selectin, which support leukocyte rolling, can induce an intermediate affinity conformation of the integrin LFA-1, allowing it to transiently bind to ICAM-1, and therefore to play a role in leukocyte rolling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kadono et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chesnutt et al., 2006</xref>). CD44-mediated rolling may improve VLA-4 ability to support T cell adhesion under flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nandi et al., 2004</xref>). In addition, ligation of PECAM-1 on leukocytes can lead to integrin activation and increased expression of &#x003b1;<sub>6</sub>&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> integrin on the surface of transmigrating neutrophils, enabling neutrophil migration through the endothelial basement membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dangerfield et al., 2002</xref>). Conversely, our results provide new evidence that the activation of leukocyte integrin promotes the adhesive function of another leukocyte adhesion molecule: JAM-L.</p><p>Interestingly, there is now a growing body of literature documenting coordinated functions between integrins and JAM family members: an interaction in trans between integrins and JAM family members can occur during leukocyte diapedesis, as described for JAM-A and JAM-B, which engage in trans with LFA-1 and VLA-4, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cunningham et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ostermann et al., 2002</xref>). In addition, controlled activation in cis of endothelial or epithelial integrins by JAMs was described during cell migration and growth factor&#x02013;mediated angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mandell et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Naik and Naik, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mandicourt et al., 2007</xref>). We demonstrate here that VLA-4 regulates JAM-L function in cis by controlling its dimerization state. Crystal structures revealed that JAM-A molecules form homodimers in cis via a dimerization motif in their membrane-distal Ig-like domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kostrewa et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Prota et al., 2003</xref>). The presence of a short linker sequence connecting the two Ig-like domains imposes a bent conformation, which is stabilized by hydrogen bonding. As a result, dimers emerge from the cell surface in the shape of an inverted U, enabling tetramer formation with extracellular membrane distal domains of JAMs expressed in trans by the adjacent cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Weber et al., 2007</xref>). The dimerization motif of JAM-A was therefore shown to be required for homophilic interaction and function in intercellular junction assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bazzoni et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Liu et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mandell et al., 2004</xref>). JAM-L possesses a comparable dimerization motif, which suggests that it may dimerize in a similar way. Accordingly, we show here that a dimerization-defective mutant of JAM-L abolishes JAM-L ability to form dimers and engage in heterophilic interactions with its counter-receptor CAR. These data provide evidence that cis dimerization of JAM-L is required for heterophilic interaction, as the dimerization motif of JAM-L was shown to not be directly involved in heterophilic interaction. Indeed, a previous study documented that JAM-L binding to CAR was mediated by an interaction between the membrane-distal Ig domain of CAR and the membrane-proximal Ig domain of JAM-L (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zen et al., 2005</xref>). JAM-L cis dimerization via interaction between both membrane-distal Ig domains might either unmask the CAR binding site within the membrane-proximal Ig domain of JAM-L and/or stabilize the interaction in trans between JAM-L and CAR.</p><p>How VLA-4 controls JAM-L dimerization and binding to CAR is still unclear. Our data indicate that, when present in an inactive conformation, VLA-4 is engaged in a complex with JAM-L, preventing the formation of JAM-L dimers. Integrin activation by Mn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> or a chemokine such as SDF-1&#x003b1;, which is known to induce conformational changes within the integrin extracellular domains, is accompanied by the dissociation of JAM-L&#x02013;VLA-4 complexes and the accumulation of JAM-L dimers at the cell surface. It is therefore tempting to speculate that a direct interaction between the extracellular domains of JAM-L and VLA-4 in its inactive conformation prevents the formation of JAM-L dimers. Interestingly, evidence for direct interaction between JAM and integrins has already been provided, thus strengthening our hypothesis: (1) JAM-A interaction in trans with LFA-1 integrin was shown to be mediated by the open active I domain in the &#x003b1;L subunit of LFA-1, which binds to the membrane-proximal Ig domain of JAM-A on endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fraemohs et al., 2004</xref>); and (2) VLA-4 can directly bind in trans to the distal Ig domain of JAM-B on endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cunningham et al., 2002</xref>). However, no stabilization of VLA-4&#x02013;JAM-L complexes was found in the presence of the chemical cross-linker, BS<sup>3</sup>, which suggests that VLA-4 may not be in close contact with JAM-L. It is therefore possible that VLA-4 might also indirectly affect the dimerization state of JAM-L either through an interaction with other transmembrane proteins or through an interaction with the cortical actin cytoskeleton. Indeed, because chemokine-induced integrin activation promotes specific interactions of the &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; cytoplasmic domains of integrins with components of the cytoskeleton, VLA-4 activation could contribute to the stabilization of functional JAM-L dimers by facilitating its interaction with cytoskeletal regulators. Future structural and biochemical studies will aim to identify the precise mechanisms by which VLA-4 controls JAM-L dimerization.</p><p>In addition, it is interesting to note that SDF-1&#x003b1; treatment of K562 cells expressing JAM-L slightly increased the quantity of JAM-L dimers and JAM-L&#x02013;mediated adhesion to CAR, although these cells do not express VLA-4. Therefore, we cannot exclude the possibility that another integrin may control JAM-L function to a lesser extent. In light of our present findings, it will now be of particular interest to address whether VLA-4 or other integrins control the functional activity of other adhesion molecules, and, in particular, whether VLA-4 may also control JAM-C function, as the interaction in trans between leukocyte VLA-4 and endothelial JAM-B cannot be observed in the absence of leukocyte JAM-C expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cunningham et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, by demonstrating an original regulation in cis of the leukocyte adhesion molecule JAM-L function by the integrin VLA-4, our results highlight a new degree of complexity in the post-adhesion events that strengthen leukocyte attachment to the endothelium. Although a network of adhesion molecules with overlapping functions mediate the capture, rolling, and firm adhesion of leukocytes to the vascular endothelium, this study adds a novel twist to this adhesion cascade.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Antibodies, reagents, and recombinant chimeric Fc-proteins</title><p>The anti&#x02013;human JAM-L (AMICA) antibody was obtained from R&#x00026;D Systems; anti&#x02013;integrin &#x003b1;4 (clone P4C2) and &#x003b2;1 (clone P5D2) were obtained from Millipore; anti-&#x003b2;2 activation epitope antibody (clone MEM-148) was obtained from AbD Serotec; anti&#x02013;integrin &#x003b2;1 activation epitope antibody (clone 9EG7), R-phycoerythrin&#x02013;conjugated anti-&#x003b1;4&#x003b2;7 antibody, and fluorescent-conjugated anti-CD4, anti-CD8, anti-CD45RO, anti-CD45RA, anti&#x02013;cutaneous leukocyte antigen (CLA), anti-CCR7, anti-CD25, and anti&#x02013;CC-chemokine receptor 4 (CCR4) were obtained from BD; anti-CD71 (clone DF1513) was obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.; anti-HA (clone 12CA5), anti-GFP, and VSV-g epitope tag (clone P5D4) antibodies were obtained from Roche; fluorescent-conjugated secondary antibodies, peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, and ECL reagents were obtained from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories; Alexa Fluor 488&#x02013;conjugated Phalloidin and the fluorescent cell tracker 5-chloromethylfluorescein diacetate (CMFDA) were obtained from Invitrogen; human recombinant SDF-1&#x003b1; was obtained from Abcys; digitonin and poly-<sc>l</sc>-Lysine solution were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich; recombinant Fc-chimeric proteins were all purchased from R&#x00026;D Systems; and BS<sup>3</sup> was obtained from Thermo Fisher Scientific.</p></sec><sec><title>Cells and culture conditions</title><p>HBMECs, provided by B.B.
