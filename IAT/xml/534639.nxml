Different strategies have been used to achieve ablation <italic>in vivo</italic>. Surgical ablation can be used to remove a specific organ or an embryonic precursor during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnh158c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnh158c5">5</xref>). Laser surgery can be used to ablate single cells in organisms with well-defined cell lineages and with a limited number of cells such as <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnh158c6">6</xref>). Ablation can also be achieved genetically, based on the temporal and spatial expression pattern of a transgene in a group of cells in a transgenic animal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnh158c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnh158c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnh158c8">8</xref>). Genetic ablation targeted by the expression of molecular markers can be more precise than surgical techniques, because molecular differences between adjacent cells are often not obvious anatomically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnh158c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnh158c9">9</xref>).</p><p>Genetic ablation in transgenic mice utilizes tissue-specific promoters to drive suicide genes, such as diphtheria toxin A chain (DTA) or <italic>Herpes Simplex Virus</italic> type I <italic>thymidine kinase</italic> (HSV1 <italic>tk</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnh158c1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnh158c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnh158c9">9</xref>). When DTA is used, the cells in the target tissue are killed when DTA is expressed. Embryonic expression of DTA ablates cells and tissues during development which prevents analysis of target tissues in later development or adult life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnh158c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnh158c10">10</xref>). When HSV1 <italic>tk</italic> is used, temporal control of the ablation is possible, because killing depends on the administration of a prodrug, such as ganciclovir (GCV) or 1-(-2-deoxy-2-fluoro-1-beta-<sc>d</sc>-arabino-furanosyl)-5-iodouracil (FIAU). Thus, ablation that causes embryonic or neonatal lethality can be avoided, enabling the physiological function of target cells to be examined in adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnh158c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnh158c8">8</xref>). Despite the advantages of HSV1 <italic>tk</italic>, its use is constrained by the infertility of male transgenic mice carrying HSV1 <italic>tk</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnh158c11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnh158c13">13</xref>).</p><p>Here, we described a mouse strain, <italic>pu&#x00394;tk</italic> selector, which responds to Cre expression by activating a conditional suicide gene, <italic>pu&#x00394;tk</italic>. Pu&#x00394;tk is a fusion protein between puromycin <italic>N</italic>-acetyltransferase and a truncated version of HSV1 <italic>tk</italic>, which does not cause male infertility in transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnh158c14">14</xref>). The <italic>pu&#x00394;tk</italic> selector allele can be used with the existing tissue-specific <italic>cre</italic> lines so that conditional cell ablation experiments can be performed in a variety of tissues.

The <italic>pu&#x00394;tk</italic> selector construct is driven by the PGK promoter which has a broad expression pattern at different developmental stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnh158c26">26</xref>). It was shown that the PGK promoter can drive ubiquitous expression of a reporter gene in many embryonic organs, including the liver, kidney, intestine, heart, limb and rib cartilage in the transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnh158c27">27</xref>). In an un-induced state, the PGK promoter drives a <italic>lox</italic>P flanked <italic>neo</italic> cassette. When Cre is expressed, recombination between the <italic>lox</italic>P sites deletes the <italic>neo</italic>-bpA cassette, resulting in juxtaposition of the <italic>pu&#x00394;tk</italic> cassette and the PGK promoter resulting in expression of <italic>pu&#x00394;tk</italic>. The suicide gene <italic>pu&#x00394;tk</italic> is only activated in cells which express Cre and their descendants. These cells can be killed by prodrugs, such as GCV or FIAU. These same cell lineages can also be selected <italic>in vitro</italic>, because the <italic>pu&#x00394;tk</italic> fusion gene enables positive selection in puromycin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnh158c28">28</xref>).</p><p>The <italic>pu&#x00394;tk</italic> cassette was targeted into the endogenous <italic>Hprt</italic> gene on the X-chromosome (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gnh158f1">1</xref>A and B). This locus is an excellent site for inserting transgenes, because a single copy transgene can be easily targeted to this locus in ES cells and <italic>Hprt</italic> null mice have a very mild phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnh158c29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnh158c31">31</xref>). The location of the <italic>pu&#x00394;tk</italic> construct on the X-chromosome enables this allele to be tracked in mice, reducing the need for molecular genotyping. X-inactivation in females allows partial ablation experiments to be conducted in situations where the ablated cell type is essential for survival, while complete ablation can be achieved in males.</p><p>The targeted <italic>pu&#x00394;tk</italic> selector ES cell line BC85-D4 was tested for its response to Cre following transient expression. The clone BC85-D4 was used to establish germ line chimaeras. The <italic>pu&#x00394;tk</italic> selector allele was only found in the female descendents from transmitting chimaeras consistent with its X-linkage. Hemizygous <italic>pu&#x00394;tk</italic> selector males were obtained in the next generation, and these did not show any overt phenotype and their fertility was normal. This is consistent with the previous observations of <italic>Hprt</italic> null mutant mice and the fertility of male mice carrying the <italic>pu&#x00394;tk</italic> cassette (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnh158c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnh158c31">31</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>GCV killing of proliferating chondrocytes</title><p>To test the effectiveness of the <italic>pu&#x00394;tk</italic> cassette in mediating Cre dependent ablation <italic>in vivo</italic>, compound heterozygous mice carrying the <italic>pu&#x00394;tk</italic> selector allele and chondrocyte-specific Cre cassette (<italic>Col2Cre</italic>) were generated (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gnh158f1">1</xref>C).</p><p>Heterozygous <italic>pu&#x00394;tk</italic> selector females were crossed to heterozygous <italic>Col2Cre</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnh158c18">18</xref>) males to generate progeny with all four possible genotypes. Owing to random X-inactivation, mosaic expression of the selector cassette is expected in females, and therefore only male progeny were used.

All four different genotypes of mice were treated with GCV from 2 weeks of age and as early as 3 weeks after the initiation of GCV treatment the growth in length of the long bones in compound heterozygotes had ceased. Mice of the other three genotypes were unaffected (data not shown). Whole body X-ray photographs were taken when the mice reached 8 weeks of age (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gnh158f3">3</xref>A). These revealed dwarfism, reduced bone density, dome-shaped rib cages and bowing of the extremities in GCV-treated compound heterozygous mice. Where the growth plates ought to have been increased opacity was noted. Thus, GCV ablation of proliferating chondrocytes appeared to block long bone growth.</p><p>Detailed analysis of Von Kossa stained sections from GCV-treated <italic>Col2Cre</italic>, <italic>pu&#x00394;tk</italic> mice revealed that both primary and secondary spongiosa were absent (data not shown) and that the growth plates were disorganized, with no obvious proliferating chondrocyte zone and an extended hypertrophic chondrocyte-like region (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gnh158f3">3</xref>C and D). Chondrocytes within the hypertrophic chondrocyte-like region were enlarged but did not appear to have undergone apoptosis. Blood vessel invasion was not observed, indicating that the long bone growth process was blocked. However, analysis of Von Kossa stained tibia sections indicated that the mineralization process was not affected (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gnh158f3">3</xref>C and D).</p></sec><sec><title>Abnormal hypertrophic chondrocyte differentiation</title><p>The extended hypertrophic chondrocyte-like region in the proliferating chondrocyte-ablated bigenic mice was examined in more detail. Tibia sections stained with safranin O, which stains cartilage matrix glycoprotein, showed that the cartilage matrix was relatively normal after the proliferating chondrocytes had been ablated (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gnh158f4">4</xref>).</p><p>Markers of proliferating chondrocytes (<italic>Col2&#x003b1;1</italic>) and hypertrophic chondrocytes (<italic>Col10&#x003b1;1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnh158c32">32</xref>) were tested by <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization on tibia growth plate sections. <italic>Col2&#x003b1;1</italic> transcripts were absent in the GCV-treated bigenic animals, indicating complete ablation of proliferating chondrocytes. <italic>Col10&#x003b1;1</italic> transcripts were absent in the tibia growth plates of the GCV-treated bigenic animals, suggesting that the enlarged chondrocytes observed in the extended hypertrophic chondrocyte-like region are not terminally differentiated hypertrophic chondrocytes. One possible explanation for this phenotype is that proliferating chondrocytes are essential for the proper function or differentiation of hypertrophic chondrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnh158c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnh158c33">33</xref>), implicating signalling between proliferating and hypertrophic chondrocytes.

Primary and secondary spongiosa was also observed in the tibia section after the recovery period. Thus, the GCV treatment did not kill or prevent resting chondrocytes from restoring a functional growth plate, and chondrocytes lying in the extended hypertrophic chondrocyte-like region were able to terminally differentiate into functional hypertrophic chondrocytes that could participate the long bone growth.</p></sec><sec><title>Embryonic GCV-mediated chondrocyte ablation</title><p>To test whether this conditional ablation system can be used during development, GCV was administered to <italic>pu&#x00394;tk selector</italic> females after mating with <italic>Col2Cre</italic> males. Daily GCV treatment was initiated 1 day after implantation (4.5 dpc) and the embryos were examined at E18.5. The sex of embryos was assessed based on anatomic features and was confirmed using a Y-chromosome-specific probe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnh158c36">36</xref>).</p><p>The GCV-treated bigenic 18.5 dpc embryos were smaller than their littermates (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gnh158f5">5</xref>A). On average, they were 70% of the normal length and 50% of the normal weight. They exhibited multiple cranial&#x02013;facial defects and an abnormal skin texture. The GCV-treated bigenic embryos show macroglossia (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gnh158f5">5</xref>B and C), which is commonly seen in mutants that have defects in chondrocyte development. The GCV-treated bigenic animals also exhibit an umbilical hernia (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gnh158f5">5</xref>D and E), cleft palate, (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gnh158f5">5</xref>F) and under ossified vertebrae (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gnh158f5">5</xref>G, H and I). Dome-shaped heads and other head abnormalities were observed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gnh158f5">5</xref>A, F and I). These features are reminiscent of those seen in mouse mutants with chondrocyte developmental defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnh158c37">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnh158c39">39</xref>).</p><p>We explored the consequences of initiating ablation at different embryonic stages. GCV treatment was initiated at E4.5, E12.5 and E14.5, which gave different degrees of chondrocyte ablation. GCV treatment initiated at 4.5 dpc results in the most severe phenotype. There is almost no ossification seen in the ribs and vertebrae of these embryos. These embryos also have a dome-shaped head resulting from the imbalance between the development of a membranous roof and the endochondral base of the cranium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnh158c38">38</xref>). The roof of the cranium is least affected since it is comprised of membranous bones that develop without a cartilage intermediate. Ossification defects were much less severe when ablation is initiated at 12.5 dpc or 14.5 dpc. Our results indicate that GCV can cross the placenta, and embryonic cell ablation can be performed at a variety of different embryonic stages.</p><p>The use of a bigenic system allows the regulatory element (tissue-specific <italic>cre</italic>) and the effector element (the <italic>pu&#x00394;tk</italic> selector cassette) to be separated in the parents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnh158c10">10</xref>). Such separation prevents prodrug-mediated ablation of maternal tissues in pregnant females. In these experiments, the bigenic embryos exhibited severe ablation of proliferating chondrocytes, but there was no discernable effect on the pregnant females. To our knowledge, this is the first reported use of the HSV1 <italic>tk</italic>&#x0002f;GCV to ablate cells during embryonic development <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>One limitation of HSV1 <italic>tk</italic>&#x0002f;GCV system is that GCV-mediated killing is limited to proliferating cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnh158c40">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnh158c42">42</xref>). Recently, several other conditional suicide gene&#x0002f;prodrug systems have been used in cell ablation experiments <italic>in vivo</italic>. <italic>DTB-r</italic>&#x0002f;DT and <italic>Ntr</italic>&#x0002f;CB1954 are two such systems in which killing is independent of cell proliferation, in principle these gene&#x0002f;prodrug systems can be used in place of HSVtk&#x0002f;GCV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnh158c43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnh158c44">44</xref>). Alternatively, <italic>DTA</italic>, <italic>M2</italic> and <italic>barnase</italic> suicide genes can be used with inducible expression systems (such as the Tet-on&#x0002f;Tet-off system) to mediate conditional killing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnh158c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnh158c45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnh158c46">46</xref>). It is possible to build effector strains similar to the <italic>pu&#x00394;tk</italic> selector described here, using different conditional suicide genes that can be activated by site-specific recombination systems, such as the Cre&#x0002f;<italic>lox</italic>P or Flp&#x0002f;<italic>frt</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnh158c47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gnh158c48">48</xref>).
