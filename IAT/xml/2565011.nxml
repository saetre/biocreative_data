Dissecting the dynamics of these escape mutations at a population-level would help to understand how HLA-mediated selection drives the evolution of HIV-1.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>We undertook a study of the dynamics of HIV-1 CTL-escape mutations by analyzing through statistical approaches and phylogenetic methods the viral gene <italic>gag</italic> sequenced in plasma samples collected between the years 1987 and 2006 from 302 drug-na&#x000ef;ve HIV-positive patients. By applying logistic regression models and after performing correction for multiple test, we identified 22 potential CTL-escape mutations (<italic>p</italic>-value&#x0003c;0.05; <italic>q</italic>-value&#x0003c;0.2); 10 of these associations were confirmed in samples biologically independent by a Bayesian Markov Chain Monte-Carlo method. Analyzing their prevalence back in time we found that escape mutations that are the consensus residue in samples collected after 2003 have actually significantly increased in time in one of either B or F subtype until becoming the most frequent residue, while dominating the other viral subtype. Their estimated prevalence in the viral subtype they did not dominate was lower than 30&#x00025; for the majority of samples collected at the end of the 80's. In addition, when screening the entire viral region, we found that the 75&#x00025; of positions significantly changing in time (p&#x0003c;0.05) were located within known CTL epitopes.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Across HIV Gag protein, the rise of polymorphisms from independent origin during the last twenty years of epidemic in our setting was related to an association with an HLA allele. The fact that these mutations accumulated in one of either B or F subtypes have also dominated the other subtype shows how this selection might be causing a convergence of viral subtypes to variants which are more likely to evade the immune response of the population where they circulate.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>HIV-1 evasion of immune response occurs through selection of mutations that impair recognition by immune effectors.

Then, we classified sequences according to the viral subtype and sample collection year and analyzed the frequency of those polymorphisms identified as CTL-escape mutations at three different intervals of time. Phylogenetic analysis showed that 93 (36.9&#x00025;) out of the 252 samples belonged to subtype B, 55 (21.8&#x00025;) were subtype F, and 103 (40.9&#x00025;) were BF recombinants, which is consistent with the fact that in South America, subtype B variants co-circulate with inter-subtype BF recombinants with similar prevalence. One sample belonged to subtype C. Regardless of the high prevalence of recombinant forms between subtypes B and F, the majority of them share a common recombination pattern, which allows us to classify them according to the structures of recombination; among the 103 recombinants, 68 (66&#x00025;) of them shared the same recombination pattern with a short subtype B segment of 200-bp at the 5&#x02032; of the region. In order to avoid confounding effects of recombination and to prevent the loss of analyzable samples, we eliminated those sequences that did not have the common structure and considered the remaining BF recombinants as B for those mutations located at the 5&#x02032;-B segment and F for those mutations located at the 3&#x02032;-F segment.</p><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003429-g001">Figure 1</xref> (upper panel), we found that polymorphisms identified as escape mutations have had a wide range of behaviors.

As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0003429-t002">Table 2</xref>, except for those three associations, limitations in our data set preclude the analysis to detect further associations due to the lack of sufficient statistical power. Therefore, it is possible that those associations confirming an HLA-mediated selection do exist although we were not able to detect them due to the reasons stated above. Also, the lower number of sites significantly changing in time found in subtype F compared with subtype B might be related with the lower sample size for the first group and the consequent lower statistical power to detect significant trends.</p><p>Considering that at a host-level it was shown that the majority of fixed amino acids substitutions are associated with CTL-response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003429-Allen2">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003429-OConnor1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, our results seem to show a similar phenomenon at a population-level, suggesting that the majority of gradual increases in mutations across Gag protein might be driven by HLA-mediated immune responses.</p><p>As we analyzed HIV sequences in a time period where antiretroviral therapy was developed and became progressively more efficient, we considered the possibility that the increased prevalence we observed be driven by antiretroviral therapy mediated selection. Among Gag protein, sites under selective pressure mediated by ARV drugs would be those where Protease-mediated cleavage occurs. We found that two of the mutations analyzed (those at positions 125 and 357) were located within epitopes that overlap the two cleavage sites located within the viral region analyzed in our study: VSQNY/PIVQN and KARVL/AEAMS. However, none of the mutations analyzed in our study are located within these sites and therefore their selection is likely to be independent of those selective forces acting over these cleavage sites.</p><p>It is important to mention that we are analyzing samples at the chronic stage of infection. In fact, considering the delay from infection to diagnosis that is common in our country it is likely that the majority of samples were obtained from individuals with advanced stages of infection. It could be possible that changes in escape mutations are influenced by disease progression; however it is expected that the majority of CTL-escape mutations to be selected at early stages of infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003429-Brumme1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref> and to persist after several years of infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003429-Allen2">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref> making samples collected even at advanced stages of infection suitable for prevalence analyses of CTL-escape mutations.</p><p>By classifying samples according to OR for associations with the HLA allele, it is possible to dissect the different dynamics in time for CTL-escape mutations identified through negative or positive associations. Those identified through positive associations seem to have remained constant over time at a low frequency, while those identified through negative associations (now the consensus state) have increased significantly in time. Other mutations found to have significantly changed in time and located in HLA-binding anchor residues, such as mutations at position 76 (third residue of B08-restricted epitope ELRSLYNTV<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003429-Altfeld2">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003429-Goulder4">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>) in our study, might have lost their associations with the HLA-allele as a consequence of the spreading of escape variants to individuals not harboring the selective allele, even more rapidly if the selective allele is at a relatively low prevalence in the population (as is HLA-B08 for escape at position 76). The reason underlying the trend toward accumulation or not might be related with the fitness cost of the mutations selected. Among mutations identified through positive association, T242N in B57-restricted epitope TW10 is the best characterized and was shown to dramatically diminish the replication capacity of HIV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003429-Leslie1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003429-MartinezPicado1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. Also within this group is the mutation K28QR in A03-restricted epitope RK9 that was shown to be selected in the presence of A03 allele and to revert in the absence of HLA-mediated selective pressure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003429-Allen1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003429-Geels1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. On the other hand, three out of the four mutations identified through negative associations are located in positions subjected to positive selection, therefore, able to adaptively evolve. In this sense, our analysis of dS/dN rate might shed some light on this issue as it is expected for sites that have significant relevance for viral fitness to be functionally constrained (undergoing a negative selection) while those sites that are less restricted to change may be able to evolve adaptively (undergoing positive selection). We found that while the majority of positions analyzed are subjected to negative selection (i.e. selection toward conservation of HIV genome identity), two out of the four positions (84 and 125) where escape was identified through negative ORs are subjected to positive selection. These results suggest that the accumulation of escape is possible in those positions where HIV is not highly restricted to change, while in positions undergoing negative selection, escape is more likely to revert. Also, there is evidence that mutation at position 30 (also identified through negative association) has no effect on HIV-1 replication in human T-cell lines (C.S. Adamson and E. O. Freed, personal communication).</p><p>Moreover, accumulation of these mutations in one viral subtype while dominating the other viral subtype might lead to an evolutionary convergence mediated by immune selection as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003429-g003">Figure 3</xref> and suggests that viral subtype, at least B and F in our population, might be a relevant feature regarding adaptation to immune response as the presence of the escape in the early ancestors would give the subtype harboring it an advantage at an epitope level against immune response mediated by the corresponding HLA allele. This advantage might be extended to other viral proteins. When we repeated the statistical analysis for the identification of escape mutations over <italic>pol</italic> and <italic>vpu</italic> genes, we found that 5 out of 19 potential CTL-escape mutations were characteristic of either the B or F subtypes, again showing a potential subtype-dependent advantage for immune evasion (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003429.s006">Table S4</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0003429-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0003429.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Trends in time of escape mutations identified through negative ORs in both B and F viral subtypes.</title><p>The four mutations identified are currently in the majority of circulating HIV strains, regardless of viral subtype. However, analysis of their prevalence back in time showed that in the early years of epidemic they dominated only one of either the B or F subtype while they were in a low prevalence in the other subtype. This means that they have accumulated in time and driven a convergence of viral subtypes toward variants more able to evade the immune response of the human hosts.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0003429.g003"/></fig><p>The overall idea that viruses are adapting to more efficiently evade the human immune system across time of HIV/AIDS worldwide epidemic implies that they are increasingly more fit over time. In contrast, Arien <italic>et al</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003429-Arien1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref> have shown that HIV viruses are increasingly less fit over time in the human host. Our results are not necessarily inconsistent with reports from Arien and colleagues as a reduced replicative fitness in head-to-head competition experiments are expected consequences for a virus that is progressively less virulent for the host; and the increased efficiency in evading the immune response at a population-level described in our study would lead to earlier rises in viral load, what in turn is expected to result in higher chances of transmission per event of exposure. Both, a lower virulence and an increased transmissibility are characteristics expected for viruses more fitted to the population of hosts where they circulate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003429-Arien2">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. It is important to note that higher levels of viral load may lead to higher rates of CD4-positive T-cells decline which is associated with a more virulent virus; however, it has been recently shown that a decline in CD4 count and not an increase of viral load is a better predictor of disease progression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003429-Rodriguez1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In summary, we found evidence of HLA-mediated selection in HIV variants circulating in our population and the escape mutations selected to follow three different behaviors in time: remain at a low prevalence, increase significantly in time or constantly dominate an entire viral subtype. Remarkably, only one of them (mutations at position 30 in subtype F) was found to have a decreasing trend in time, although it was not significant (<italic>p</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.106). In this sense our results shed some light into the rationality for vaccine design as the fact that some mutations have the potential to accumulate in time means that vaccines targeting epitopes containing them will eventually reduce their effectiveness. Therefore, to identify CTL escape mutations that are restricted to spread like those classified as &#x0201c;positive associations&#x0201d; in this study, should be a key factor for the development of future vaccines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003429-Altfeld3">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. We also found that HLA-mediated selection, as it is known occurs at host-level, may also account for the majority of temporal trends of residues significantly rising in time at a population-level. Finally, the presence of the escape state as part of the natural genome of a viral subtype suggests a subtype-related evolutionary advantage and shows the force of HLA-driven evolution to induce a convergence of viral subtypes to HIV variants better able to evade the immune response of the population where they circulate.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0003429.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Consensus sequence obtained for the HLA/polimorphism analysis.
