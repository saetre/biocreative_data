A substantial proportion of esophageal carcinoma is associated with infection of high-risk HPV type 16 and HPV18, the oncogenic expression of which is controlled by host cell transcription factor Activator Protein-1 (AP-1). We, therefore, have investigated the role of DNA binding and expression pattern of AP-1 in esophageal cancer with or without HPV infection.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Seventy five histopathologically-confirmed esophageal cancer and an equal number of corresponding adjacent normal tissue biopsies from Kashmir were analyzed for HPV infection, DNA binding activity and expression of AP-1 family of proteins by PCR, gel shift assay and immunoblotting respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A high DNA binding activity and elevated expression of AP-1 proteins were observed in esophageal cancer, which differed between HPV positive (19%) and HPV negative (81%) carcinomas. While JunB, c-Fos and Fra-1 were the major contributors to AP-1 binding activity in HPV negative cases, Fra-1 was completely absent in HPV16 positive cancers. Comparison of AP-1 family proteins demonstrated high expression of JunD and c-Fos in HPV positive tumors, but interestingly, Fra-1 expression was extremely low or nil in these tumor tissues.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Differential AP-1 binding activity and expression of its specific proteins between HPV - positive and HPV - negative cases indicate that AP-1 may play an important role during HPV-induced esophageal carcinogenesis.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is one of the most common cancers in the world with extremely poor prognosis due to late presentation and rapid progression. It is eighth among the most common cancers worldwide and fifth most common cancer in developing countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. ESCC shows a great variation in geographic distributions and the incidence rates are remarkably higher in distinct areas such as China, Singapore, Iran, France, South Africa, Puerto Rico, Chile, Brazil and northern and eastern Himalayan region. The wide geographical variation in the incidence reflects strong influence of environmental factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. This cancer is also a major health problem in India; particularly in Kashmir valley and is associated with characteristic food and drinking habits such as drinking of hot salted tea which contains carcinogenic compounds like nitrosamines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Besides salted tea, tobacco smoking (Hukka; local name Jajjer) is also very common in this area and is a potential risk factor for increased incidence of esophageal cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Though recent reports have documented alterations of some oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, the exact molecular and genetic basis of esophageal carcinogenesis still remains poorly understood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Several studies have demonstrated infection of human papillomaviruses (HPVs) in esophageal cancer world over [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Though prevalence of this virus varies between 10 - 70% from one geographical region to other, the infection of high risk HPV (HR-HPV) types mainly HPV type 16 and HPV18 is found to be the most common in almost all parts of the world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Our earlier study has also demonstrated that a significant proportion of esophageal cancer cases from Kashmir region are infected with HR-HPV type 16 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. This and other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] indicate an oncogenic role of HR-HPV types in esophageal carcinogenesis. Since the virus does not have its own transcriptional machinery, the expression of its two transforming oncogenes, E6 and E7, depends primarily on availability of host cell transcription factors, particularly the Activator Protein-1 (AP-1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. It has been demonstrated that a point mutation in the AP-1 consensus sequence within the binding site of upstream regulatory region (URR) of HPV16/18 leads to complete abolition of E6 and E7 gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Recent study also indicates that HPV infection may result in reciprocal alteration in AP-1 activity and its composition that could affect downstream gene expression and signaling leading to tumorigenesis of the infected cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and better prognosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. However, currently there is no study that defines the role of AP-1 in HPV induced esophageal carcinogenesis.</p><p>Considering the important role of AP-1 in a variety of epithelial cancers in general and those infected with HPV in particular, the present study has been carried out to investigate the possible relationship between HPV infection and expression profile of AP-1 family proteins in association with other etiological factors in the development of ESCC in Kashmir valley.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Patients and Specimens</title><p>A total of 150 tissue specimens comprising of 75 tumor tissues and 75 corresponding adjacent normal tissues as a control of ESCC, from 25 cases with no dysphagia and 50 cases of either grade I, II, and III dysphagia as classified earlier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], were collected for analysis in the present study [Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>]. None of these patients received any pre-operative radiation or chemotherapy. All samples were surgically resected and were collected at the Department of Cardio Vascular and Thoracic Surgery of Sher-I-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences, Soura, Srinagar, Kashmir (India). Tissue samples were divided into two parts; one part was sent to histopathological diagnosis and other half was stored in -70&#x000b0;C for molecular investigations. Histopathological grades and clinical staging were evaluated according to standard criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] by two pathologists independently with 17 cases graded as well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma (WDSSC), 45 as moderately-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma (MDSCC) and 13 as poorly-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma (PDSCC) whereas 46 patients were scored as stage I &#x00026; II and 29 as stage III &#x00026; IV. Only histopathologically confirmed cases were included for molecular analysis. Written informed consent was obtained from all the subjects included in the study and was carried out in accordance with the principles of the Helsinki Declaration.

The specificity of AP-1 binding activity was confirmed by re-testing the samples for Oct-1 which is ubiquitously active in all cells and was used as an internal control by performing cold competition assay with 100-fold molar excess of homologous AP-1 and a heterologous Oct-1 cold probe (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>).

In the present study, we demonstrate for the first time, constitutive activation of AP-1 in ESCCs and change in binding partners that form active AP-1complex in ESCCs. ESCC with HPV infections constituted a significant proportion (19%; 14/75) and interestingly all these cases harbored the most prevalent high-risk HPV type 16. Constitutive activation of AP-1 leading to its high binding activity was observed in most of the esophageal tumors, irrespective of their clinical stage and histo - pathological grade; whereas normal adjacent tissues showed low or no AP-1 activation. Aberrant AP-1 activity is one of the most frequent mechanisms of tumor promotion in epithelial tissues irrespective of the tumor site and is mediated through activation of its upstream kinases such as ERK, JNK and p38 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Similar to our observation, constitutively active AP-1 has also been observed in other epithelial cell malignancies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. But the mechanism(s) by which AP-1 or its upstream regulatory kinases get activated in ESCC is not known. Apart form physiological regulators like growth factors, cytokines or hormones, AP-1 activity is also induced by bacterial and viral infections as well as many carcinogens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Recent study showed that HPV which is found in almost all cervical cancer, can also promote AP-1 activation to a significant level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Apart from HPV, other infections such as <italic>H. pylori</italic>, prevalence of which is notably high in Kashmir region, are also known to induce AP-1 activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Another factor that could significantly contribute to constitutive activation of AP-1 is consumption of sodium-bicarbonate-brewed hot salted tea which is very widely consumed by majority of people in snow-capped Kashmir Valley [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. This salted tea it is rich in carcinogenic N-nitroso compounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] that primarily act through AP-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Interestingly, majority of ESCC cases investigated in the present study showed AP-1 activation had a high intake of salted tea.</p><p>Functional AP-1 complex is constituted either by homo- or hetero-dimerization between different members of Jun and Fos family of proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Our results demonstrate a preferential participation of JunB and c-Fos in active AP-1 complex formation in almost all tumors irrespective of HPV infection. Interestingly, HPV positive tumors demonstrated an additional participation of JunD in AP-1 DNA binding complex. Also, Fra-1 which showed minor participation in HPV negative tumors was completely absent in HPV positive cases. Apart from formation of heterodimer between Jun and Fos proteins, homodimerization of Jun proteins is also known to form active AP-1 complex but complete absence of cJun in supershift assays indicate that cJun do not participate in functional AP-1 complex formation and hence no jun homodimer formation takes place in ESCC. It is interesting to note here that though c-Jun showed elevated expression in western blotting (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>), it does not participate in DNA binding activity. It is quite possible that even if a protein is overexpressed, it may not always participate in DNA binding activity and trans-activation possibly due to mutation within the binding sites or otherwise. It can also be speculated that in addition to posttranslational modifications of c-Jun, a simple competition with JunB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] and JunD to bind with cFos, may also account for the exclusion of cJun from AP-1 complex in esophageal cancer. It is interesting to note that presence of active JunB/cFos dimers may provide a favorable niche for establishment of HPV infection and viral propagation as two AP-1 binding sites are present in URR of HPV18 that essentially require JunB containing hetrodimers for HPV transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. These observations, therefore, indicate presence of suitable co-operativity between the virus and the host for expression of viral oncogenes.</p><p>Most of the ESCC tissues irrespective of their clinical and histopathological grade showed a high expression of AP-1 family of proteins in tumor tissues as compared to their normal counterparts. Upregulated AP-1 activity is frequently associated with overexpression of its family members [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Since majority of AP-1 members are part of immediate early response genes and express differentially in non-neoplastic and neoplastic tissues as well as contribute both in early events of tumorigenesis and tumor progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], elevated AP-1 expression and activity appears to be generic carcinogenesis-associated event. Though it is well established that AP-1 regulates the expression of HPV oncogenes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], recent observations indicate that HPV reciprocally modulate AP-1 expression and its activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. We stratified expression levels of AP-1 which revealed a differentially higher expression of JunD and cFos proteins in HPV-positive tumors, whereas Fra-1 levels were characteristically low or nil in them. Fra-1 was, however, highly expressed in HPV- negative tumors. Over-expression of Fra-1 and cFos have been demonstrated in esophageal cancers in some sporadic studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. On the contrary, an <italic>in vitro </italic>study demonstrated increase of cFos in HPV16-transformed cell lines is associated with decreased expression of its negative regulator Fra-1 as well as their reduced contribution in active DNA-binding activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In an ingenious experiment, overexpression of cFos in HPV 18 positive non-tumorigenic HeLa - Fibroblast hybrid 444 cells having low or no cFos but a very high amount of Fra-1 expression resulted in tumorigenic cells which showed complete loss of Fra-1 but a high expression of cFos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. These observations perfectly match with <italic>in vivo </italic>situations in HPV-infected esophageal tumors, where Fra-1 expression was diminished or completely absent. These observations, therefore, indicate a potential antagonistic effect of HPV infection on Fra-1. Fra-1 have been proposed to have tumor suppressor function as it is located in chromosome 11q13 region which is known to harbor tumor suppressor genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] and its over-expression have recently been shown to inhibit cell proliferation, induce apoptosis and reduce tumorigenesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Moreover, change in AP-1 composition resulting in elimination of Fra-1 has been found to be associated with enhanced tumorigenesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Thus, lack of Fra-1 appears to contributing to more aggressiveness of the disease, as majority of these patients were infected with HPV and in poorly-differentiated state. This is in sharp contrast to our recent observation in oral cancer, where presence of HPV but lack of Fra-1 expression was observed mainly in well-differentiated oral squamous cell carcinomas that showed better prognosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Thus, it appears that the role of Fra-1 as a tumor suppressor or oncogene may vary from tumor to tumor and on host-virus interactions.</p><p>Considering oncogenic role of HPVs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] and their co-operative interaction with AP-1 signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], infection with HPV has been implicated as a possible etiological factor in the development of squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus. Our results demonstrated unlike cervical cancers where HR-HPV infection is an essential etiological factor, the percentage of cases with HPV infection in ESCC was small and accounted for about one fifth of total cases. Occurrence of HPV infection in esophageal cancer is variable and conflicting, ranging from complete absence to detection of up to 60 to 70% mainly of high - risk HPV types 16 and 18 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Our earlier study on different subset of samples from the same region showed similar frequency of HPV16 infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Though considerable proportions of esophageal cancers have been shown to have HPV infection and that too of high risk types, the etiological role of HPV in these cancers is not established. It is suggested that HPV infection when present may act as a co-factor or have synergistic effects with environmental carcinogens in the genesis of ESCC and/or their progression. We also demonstrate a significant correlation of HPV infection with smoking habit and intake of nitrosated compounds in salted tea [Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>]. The entry of HPV in esophageal cancers appears to be in later stages as the infection was more prevalent in clinically advanced tumors. Therefore, HPV may significantly influence the disease progression rather than initiation. In contrast to genital cancers, it has been shown that HPV infection may be associated with better prognosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] as it is found more in well-differentiated squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] and may positively influence the treatment outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Therefore, determination of HPV status in esophageal cancer may also be helpful in predicting the treatment outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Present investigation provides evidence of a constitutively activated AP-1 in esophageal cancers and demonstrates involvement of JunB, JunD and cFos as major DNA binding partners whereas it clearly negates the role of canonical AP-1 partner, cJun. Expression of AP-1 proteins and their DNA-binding activity was found to differ between HPV positive and HPV negative tumors. Considering that HR-HPV infection causes better prognosis in head and neck cancers, present findings may provide clue(s) for better understanding of HPV-mediated esophageal carcinogenesis and development of treatment strategies.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>SH carried out all experiments and primary manuscript writing.
