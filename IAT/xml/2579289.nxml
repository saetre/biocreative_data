Furthermore, taurine reduced the secretion of apoB, which is a major protein component of very low-density lipoprotein.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This is a first report to demonstrate that taurine inhibits the secretion of apoB from HepG2 cells.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Taurine, <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-sulphonic amino acid was first isolated more than 150 years ago from ox bile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Taurine is considered to be an essential nutrient for human infants and cats and distributed extensively in mammalian cells and tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Its recognized metabolic function in liver is conjugation with bile acids, which is important for bile secretion and lipid digestion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Nevertheless, taurine also has beneficial effects on the liver that include prevention and treatment of cholestasis and prevention of liver damaged due to toxic chemicals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>In past decades, much attention has been paid to the effects of taurine on bile acid metabolism. Conversely, a few studies concerning the role of taurine on the other liver lipids have been reported. Liver is the central organ of lipid metabolism. Previous in vitro studies with human hepatoblastoma cells showed that cellular levels of taurine were associated with the rate of bile acid synthesis, the reduction of free cellular cholesterol concentration and the higher expression of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Similarly, in vivo studies have shown that supplementation with taurine influences the serum cholesterol levels in the experimental animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. This was associated with the alterations of activities of 7 <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>-hydroxylase and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutarylutaryl coenzyme A reductase in the liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Thus, it appears that taurine involves not only in biliary lipid secretion, but also in cholesterol metabolism in the liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. This possibility is also supported by the previous reports showing taurine-related changes in liver lipid composition of the experimental animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>However, even though liver is the central organ of lipid metabolism, only a few studies concerning the effect of taurine on liver lipid metabolism has been reported. In addition, the mechanism for these effects has been not worked out in detail. In addition, there are controversies about the effect of taurine on serum lipid concentrations in human beings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>Taurine biosynthesis derives from the trans-sulphuration pathway originating with methionine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Liver and serum taurine levels in rats are reported to be approximately 3.62 &#x003bc;mol/g liver, and 2.5 &#x003bc;mol/ml serum, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>The liver is the organ to synthesize and secrete the lipoproteins containing apolipoprotein B100 (apoB). ApoB is an essential structural component of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) and LDL and is required for the intracellular assembly and the secretion of these lipoproteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The biological role of VLDL is primarily related to TG transport and eventually to cholesterol transport to the tissues. The synthesis of all these components occur on endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes and nascent VLDL particles are assembled from these components before the lipoprotein formation and secretion is accomplished. As the elevation of the concentration of apoB as well as of LDL cholesterol is regarded as an important risk factor for coronary artery disease. It is important to investigate the factors controlling the secretion rate of apoB-containing lipoprotein by the liver.</p><p>The present studies were designed to examine whether taurine alters apoB secretion and lipid metabolism using the human hepatoblastoma cells, HepG 2, as a model of human liver. HepG2 cells have been found to retain many typical functions of the normal human hepatocytes, including lipoprotein and apolipoprotein synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Protein content, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) cytotoxicactivity and taurine concentration in the cells</title><p>As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, the concentration of cellular taurine was increased in a dose-dependent manner by increasing concentration of taurine added to the medium.

ApoB is required for the assembly and secretion of apoB-containing lipoproteins which transport hydrophobic lipids, cholesterol ester, and TG in their cores. Regulation of the assembly and secretion of apoB-containing lipoproteins has become an active area of investigation as it is recognized that overproduction of apoB-containing lipoproteins may be responsible for coronary artery disease and hyperlipidemia.</p><p>The present study focused on examining the effects of taurine on the secretion of TG, cholesterol and apoB from HepG2 cells. Taurine had no affect on MTT activity and cellular protein content in the present cultured condition. Thus, it suggests that an addition of taurine from the concentrations of 10<sup>-5 </sup>to 10<sup>-3 </sup>M in the culture medium did not show any cytotoxic effect. When HepG2 cells contains a higher concentration of cellular TG by preincubated with oleic acid-rich medium, taurine remarkably reduced TG-mass (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) in both the cells and the medium. In the same condition, taurine reduced the incorporation of [<sup>14</sup>C] oleic acid into cellular TG (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), suggesting the inhibition of TG synthesis.</p><p>Taurine influenced cholesterol metabolism in HepG2 cells. In condition 1, taurine (10<sup>-3 </sup>M) significantly reduced not only the cellular cholesterol-mass (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) but also the synthesis and secretion of [<sup>14</sup>C] oleoylcholesterol (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>), suggesting the inhibition of cholesterol ester synthesis in the cells. It is well known that cholesterol ester formation is catalyzed by acyl-coenzyme A: cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) form free cholesterol and acyl-CoA. Reduction of the synthesis of cholesterol ester may suggest that relatively high amount taurine exerts for ACAT inhibitor.</p><p>ApoB is a major protein component of plasma VLDL and LDL. First, the effects of the concentration in the medium on apoB accumulation at the end of the incubation period were determined. We found that taurine inhibits apoB secretion from human hepatocytes preincubated with oleate medium (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). To determine if changes in intracellular lipid metabolism were responsible for the alteration on apoB secretion, appropriate radiolabeled tracer was added to the medium, the synthesis of cholesterol, cholesterol ester and TG was determined. Because high concentration of apoB has been implicated as risk factor for the development of atherosclerosis, reduction of apoB suggests the beneficial effect of taurine. Results suggest that there is an associated decrease in apoB secretion with a decrease in TG synthesis. Thus, a reduction of TG synthesis may inhibit VLDL-apoB secretion. An important factor determining VLDL-apoB secretion is the size of the intracellular TG pool [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Availability of TG for lipoprotein assembly greatly influences the size of VLDL particle secreted by the liver.</p><p>There is evidence to suggest the cholesterol ester can also regulate apoB secretion. Our group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] and Dashti [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] reported that cholesterol ester synthesis might be a critical element for regulating apoB secretion by hepatocytes. Elevation of the serum cholesterol concentration is known to increase the risk of coronary heart disease. Depressed cholesterol ester formation by taurine may be beneficial for the prevention of such diseases. Recently microsomal triacylglycerol transfer protein (MTP) has been identified as a necessary factor for the assembly of TG-rich lipoproteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. MTP is localized in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum in the liver and intestine, where it transfers TG, cholesterol ester, and phospholipids between phospholipid membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. However, effect of taurine on MTP activity remains to be determined.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Overall, the present study demonstrated that taurine inhibits the secretion of cholesterol ester, TG and apoB in HepG2 cells. The reduction of lipid secretion is partly associated with the inhibition of cellular lipid synthesis. This is the first direct demonstration that taurine inhibits the secretion of apoB in HepG2 cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>HepG2 cells culture</title><p>HepG2 cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS, penicillin (100 &#x003bc;g/ml), and streptomycin (100 &#x003bc;g/ml) at 37&#x000b0;C in an atmosphere containing 95% air and 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].
