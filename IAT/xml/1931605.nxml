Based on their tissue distribution, the low cell density, morphological features and co-immunostaining with different epithelial markers, we identified these cells as brush cells (also known as tuft, fibrillovesicular, multivesicular or caveolated cells).

By sequence homology, members of the family fall into six subfamilies (TRPC, TRPV, TRPM, TRPML, TRPP, and TRPA). There is mounting evidence that TRP channels are involved in thermosensation, mechanosensation, smell and taste. A subset of TRP channels, called 'thermo-TRPs' (TRPV1-TRPV4, TRPA1 and TRPM8), have been found to be highly temperature dependent and are directly involved in heat and cold sensation in the peripheral nervous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Several TRP channels are mechanosensitive or activated by hypotonic challenge (TRPV4, TRPA1, TRPM3, PKD1 and TRPP2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. TRPC2 is specifically expressed in the rodent sensory epithelium of the vomeronasal organ (VNO) where it plays a critical role in signaling processes triggered by pheromones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. More recently, evidence was obtained for a critical role of TRP channels in taste perception. Thus, PKD2L1 (TRPP2) and PKD1L3 are co-expressed in a subset of taste receptor cells (TRC) which are responsible for the detection of sour tastants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. TRPM5 was found to be essential for sweet, bitter and umami taste perception. TRPM5 is immunolocalized in a subset of TRC, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and two independently generated TRPM5 knock-out mouse models display diminished sweet, bitter and umami perception [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Interestingly, the sensitivity of TRPM5 to temperature was suggested to be the molecular mechanism underlying the psychophysical phenomenon of "thermal taste", i.e. enhanced sweetness perception with increasing temperature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Studies of the biophysical properties of TRPM5 in heterologous expression systems by us and other groups revealed a monovalent-selective cation channel, directly gated by intracellular calcium, which rises upon stimulation of guanine nucleotide-binding regulatory protein (G protein)-coupled receptors (GPCR) linked to phospholipases type C (PLC). Furthermore, TRPM5 is regulated by voltage and phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. TRPM4, the closest homologue of TRPM5, displays a similar activation mechanism and channel properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. TRPM4 and TRPM5 have been proposed as molecular candidates for calcium-activated nonselective (CAN) cation channels observed in many excitable and non-excitable cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. CAN channels are assumed to be involved in membrane depolarization and, consequently, in the regulation of the intracellular calcium concentration.</p><p>Mechanistically, however, the role of TRPM5 in TRC is poorly understood. Taste buds consist of four different cell types (I-IV). Type II taste receptor cells are assumed to be directly involved in sweet, bitter and umami perception [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Taste compounds stimulate GPCRs for sweet and amino acids (T1R) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] and bitter (T2R) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] resulting in activation of the G-protein gustuducin (G&#x003b1;<sub>gust</sub>). Consequently, calcium is released from internal stores via activation of PLC&#x003b2;2 and subsequent inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>) binding to IP<sub>3 </sub>receptor type III (IP<sub>3</sub>RIII). Elevated calcium levels activate TRPM5 leading to depolarization of the plasma membrane due to influx of Na<sup>+</sup>. The molecular events following TRPM5 activation are still under debate. Recently, gap junction hemichannels were proposed to be involved downstream of TRPM5 activation in taste signal transduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. It is also unknown whether TRPM5 is associated with T1R/T2R and G&#x003b1;<sub>gust </sub>as one functional unit due to sub-cellular compartmentalization, or whether TRPM5 represents an independent signaling component localized in distinct and specialized subcellular compartments of TRC.</p><p>It is assumed that the gastrointestinal and the respiratory tracts have the ability to analyze the composition of their luminal content in order to adequately respond to toxins and irritants. Thus, signaling molecules enriched in TRC have also been identified in populations of solitary epithelial cells in organs other than taste buds. For example, G&#x003b1;<sub>gust </sub>was found in brush cells of the gastrointestinal tract and in pancreatic duct cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Bitter taste receptors, T2Rs, G&#x003b1;<sub>gust</sub>, PLC&#x003b2;2 and the IP<sub>3</sub>III receptor were immunolocalized in solitary chemosensory cells (SCC) in the larynx and respiratory epithelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. G&#x003b1;<sub>gust </sub>was found to be expressed in L type enteroendocrine cells in the human colon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. These observations support the notion that a population of specialized epithelial cells is present in different organs and may constitute part of a diffuse chemosensory system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. At present, common functional, morphological and biochemical criteria defining this putative cell system or these systems are not available and are the subject of intensive investigation.</p><p>Here we report that TRPM5 is highly abundant in rodent chemosensory organs including taste buds, the olfactory epithelium and the VNO, as well as in a subset of solitary cells distributed throughout the epithelia of the respiratory system and the gastrointestinal tract. The latter cells display morphological and biochemical cell features of brush cells (also known as tuft, fibrillovesicular, multivesicular or caveolated cells). Collectively, our data suggest that TRPM5 expression defines a population of specialized chemosensory cells and, thus, may offer a new point of entry to dissect molecular mechanisms involved in the processing of environmental cues by the respiratory system and the gastrointestinal tract.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Localization of TRPM5 on the basolateral surface of taste receptor cells</title><p>To elucidate a biological role of TRPM5 we set out to study its expression pattern in rodent tissues using an immunohistochemical approach. To this end, we generated a polyclonal anti-TRPM5 antibody (AB-321) and tested its specificity in HEK 293 cells transiently transfected with the cDNA of mouse TRPM5. In Western blots of whole-cell lysates obtained from HEK 293 cells expressing either TRPM5 or YFP-TRPM5, the anti-TRPM5 antibody detected protein bands of expected sizes (~130 kDa and ~160 kDa, respectively) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). The immunoreactivity was abolished by preincubation of the antibody with the corresponding immunization peptide. Next, we tested the AB-321 antibody by indirect immunofluorescence staining of HEK 293 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). In contrast to untransfected cells, TRPM5-expressing cells displayed a fluorescent signal, which could be completely blocked by the corresponding immunization peptide. Of note, the subcellular distribution of TRPM5 immunoreactivity was similar to that observed by imaging of living HEK 293 cells expressing TRPM5 fused to a YFP tag (data not shown). To summarize, two independent approaches showed that the generated antibody AB-321 specifically recognized the mouse TRPM5 protein.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Immunolocalization of TRPM5 in taste buds of mouse papillae vallatae</bold>.

In line with recent reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], AB-321 elicited a strong immunofluorescent signal in a subpopulation of TRCs in taste buds, while the surrounding tongue tissue was negative for TRPM5. TRPM5 immunoreactivity was blocked by the corresponding immunization peptide (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F</xref>). Notably, we only detected a TRPM5 immunofluorescent signal at the basolateral membrane of some TRC. In order to confirm this observation, we performed co-localization studies of TRPM5 and the lectin Ulex Europaeus Agglutinin (UEA), a membrane marker of all taste bud cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1G&#x02013;I</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. In fact, we found that TRPM5 is mainly localized at the basolateral cell surface of TRC and is absent in the gustatory pore, readily stained by UEA.</p></sec><sec><title>Expression of TRPM5 in chemosensory organs</title><p>Due to its biophysical characteristics (activation mechanisms, fast kinetics of activation and inactivation, high temperature sensitivity) TRPM5 appears to be well suited to function in sensory cells. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that TRPM5 may be present in sensory organs other than taste buds.</p><p>While we did not detect TRPM5 in the retina (data not shown), we obtained positive signals in chemosensory organs: the olfactory epithelium and the VNO (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). In the main olfactory epithelium, we detected TRPM5 in solitary epithelial cells whose nuclei were mainly localized superficially, at the level of the supporting cell layer (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A,B</xref>). Occasionally, few nuclei of TRPM5 immunopositive cells appeared in the basal part of the epithelium (data not shown). Like typical ciliated olfactory cells, TRPM5-expressing cells have elongated cell bodies that reach both the lumen and the basal membrane (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C,D</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>TRPM5 expression in mouse main olfactory epithelium and the vomeronasal organ</bold>.

Therefore, we systematically searched rodent organs for TRPM5 protein expression by immunohistochemistry. TRPM5 could not be detected in liver, pancreas, kidney, spleen, lymph nodes, vessels, salivary glands, ovary, blood cells, fat cells, skeletal and smooth muscle (data not shown). We did, however, observe TRPM5 immunoreactive cells in the respiratory system (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) as well as in the gastrointestinal tract (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>TRPM5 is specifically expressed in brush cells of the respiratory system</bold>.

Occasionally, in some regions of the tracheal epithelium TRPM5-expressing cells appeared in clusters (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D&#x02013;F</xref>). Remarkably, the apical surface of TRPM5-positive cells contacted the lumen, while the basolateral part bore a long extension (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). Like in TRCs, TRPM5 in respiratory tract cells was restricted to the basolateral membrane (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D&#x02013;I</xref>).</p><p>The distribution and morphological characteristics of these TRPM5-expressing cells were indicative of neuroendocrine cells, neuroendocrine bodies or brush cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. In order to assign the TRPM5-expressing cells to one of these entities, we performed double immunostainings against TRPM5 and cell-specific markers.</p><p>Typical markers for neuroendocrine cells and bodies, i.e. chromogranin A, protein gene product 9, and calcitonin gene-related peptide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] were found not to co-localize with TRPM5 (data not shown). It is well established that brush cells of the respiratory system and the gastrointestinal tract display unique morphological features not observed in any other epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. First, their numerous apical microvilli are highly enriched in filaments which extend basally into the supranuclear area. Second, brush cells contain microvilli with corresponding rootlets of filaments extending from the lateral cell surface. Consequently, fluorescence microscopy enables the detection of intense immunoreactivity of villin in the apical as well as in the lateral regions of brush cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Another remarkable feature of brush cells is that their enrichment in villin is invariably accompanied by an intense immunoreactivity to cytokeratin 18 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Therefore, we used antibodies specific for villin or anti-cytokeratin 18 (CK18), for co-immunostainings of these proteins and TRPM5 in tracheal tissue sections. We noted an invariable co-localization of these protein markers and TRPM5 in the same cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D&#x02013;I</xref>) indicating that TRPM5-positive cells of the trachea are most probably brush cells. Rat alveolar epithelia contain solitary villin-positive cells considered to be brush cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Therefore, we tested whether these cells that we could detect with an anti-villin antibody, would also yield a positive TRPM5 staining. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3J&#x02013;L</xref> shows that TRPM5 and villin are invariably co-localized in solitary alveolar cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Localization of TRPM5 in the gastrointestinal tract</title><p>Brush cells are known to be expressed not only in the respiratory system, but throughout the gastrointestinal tract, and Northern blot analysis indicates a considerable enrichment of TRPM5 mRNA in the intestine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Thus, we extended our study to a detailed immunohistochemical analysis of the gut. Throughout the gastrointestinal tract, we detected solitary TRPM5-positive cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). In the stomach, TRPM5-enriched cells were readily seen in the principal part of the gastric glands, most abundantly in the cardiac region (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A,B</xref>). In the small intestine (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C,D</xref>) and colon (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4G,H</xref>) scarce solitary TRPM5-positive cells were scattered throughout the epithelial sheet with a conspicuous enrichment in the villar region in the ileum (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E,F</xref>).</p><p>Similar to their counterparts in the tracheal epithelium, the TRPM5-positive cells in the gastrointestinal tract share morphological features with brush cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>).

Unlike the surrounding gut epithelial cells, TRPM5-positive cells display a conspicuous apical microvillar tuft reminiscent of brush cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C,D</xref>). Moreover, like in TRC and respiratory brush cells, TRPM5 expression sites were confined to the basolateral cell surface.</p><p>In order to determine whether or not the cells detected were <italic>bona fide </italic>brush cells, we performed immunohistochemical co-stainings of TRPM5-positive cells with the brush cell marker CK18 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5E&#x02013;G</xref>). Most of the TRPM5-expressing cells displayed a clear co-localization with CK18. However, we found a minor CK18-negative fraction (~30%), either due to limited sensitivity, or because these cells represent a distinct subtype. Conversely, all cells staining positively for CK18 clearly expressed TRPM5.</p><p>To summarize, we found that TRPM5 is expressed throughout the gastrointestinal tract, specifically in solitary epithelial cells, which can be classified as brush cells based on cell distribution, morphological criteria and the presence of a specific marker protein.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Studies on TRP channels have significantly extended our knowledge of the molecular events underlying the sensation of temperature, mechanical force, smell and taste. Thus, TRPM5 was recently shown to be enriched in TRC and is essential for the perception of sweet, bitter and umami taste compounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. However, it is well documented in the scientific literature that the expression pattern of TRPM5 is not restricted to taste buds. These findings prompted us to test the hypothesis that TRPM5 may play a broader functional role in chemosensation than initially suggested by experiments with TRPM5-deficient mice.</p><p>To this end, we raised and tested anti-TRPM5 antibodies whose staining pattern of taste receptor cells is fully congruent with previous work by other researchers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. However, performing a more detailed analysis, we observed in addition that the basolateral plasma membrane of TRC is readily stained, whereas the apical part, the gustatory pore, is spared &#x02013; a principle applying to all other TRPM5 positive cells investigated with the notable exception of cells in the sensory epithelium of the VNO. These observations provide further insight into the function of TRPM5 in TRC. Most other TRP channels that are involved in sensory signaling are eo ipso receptors of extra- or intracellular messengers and are found at the exact location of primary signal detection. This notion holds true for both direct signal detectors like heat- or cold-sensing TRPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>] as well as for TRPC channels that are activated by a receptor and G protein-dependent signaling cascade like TRP and TRPL in the insect rhabdomere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>], the TRPC2 channel expressed in the dendritic knob of rodent VNO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] or TRPC6 expressed in microvillar cells of the main olfactory epithelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Our data suggest that TRPM5 is not directly involved in the process of taste recognition. Activation of TRPM5 may depolarize the basolateral plasma membrane resulting in the modulation of other voltage-dependent ion channels and subsequent neurotransmitter release. Alternatively, the TRPM5-mediated depolarization of the basolateral membrane could modulate the function of gap junctions, and, thus change the physiological status of neighboring cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>].</p><p>Our studies with other sensory organs strongly indicate that in addition to taste perception TRPM5 is also involved in the processing of olfactory stimuli. Accordingly, we identified TRPM5 in two chemosensory organs, VNO and olfactory epithelia.</p><p>We detected TRPM5 in solitary cells within the non-sensory epithelium and apically in the sensory epithelium of the VNO. Interestingly, another member of the TRP gene family, the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable TRPC2 is also present on the apical cell surface of the sensory epithelium of the VNO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Thus, it is imaginable that in conjunction with TRPC2, TRPM5 is required for the detection of pheromones. In this context it should be recalled that TRPM5 cDNA was isolated from the VNO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Furthermore, CAN channel activity with electrophysical properties similar to TRPM5 or TRPM4 was measured in freshly isolated VNO neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. Preliminary findings of our group using an anti-TRPM4 antibody illustrate that TRPM4 is highly expressed in the sensory epithelium of the VNO where it localizes to the apical region of sensory cells like TRPM5 (data not shown). These findings raise the possibility that in the VNO, TRPM4 and TRPM5 are co-expressed and co-localized and might therefore assemble to form heteromultimeric channels whose subcellular trafficking and functional properties could differ from either channel expressed alone in other cells.</p><p>In the olfactory epithelium, TRPM5 was found in scattered cells. The morphology and distribution of TRPM5-expressing cells are reminiscent of microvillar cells which are thought to be involved in sensing of odorants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. By means of immunohistochemical criteria, it was recently shown that microvillar cells can be classified into at least two subtypes, one of which was denoted brush cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>] that were also found to be localized in the non-sensory epithelium of the VNO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. The physiological relevance of TRPM5 expression in the VNO and the olfactory epithelium still remains to be clarified by a meticulous analysis of odorant and pheromone sensing in TRPM5-deficient mice. While this manuscript was under review, Lin W. et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>] reported expression data similar to ours for TRPM5 in the main olfactory epithelium. Furthermore, these authors provided evidence for an involvement of TRPM5 in the sensing of semiochemicals, compatible with our hypothesis that TRPM5 may take part in chemosensation.</p><p>It was recently postulated that a population of specialized cells of the respiratory epithelium and gastrointestinal tract forming the so-called diffuse chemosensory system participates in the recognition and processing of diverse environmental cues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. This assumption was recently substantiated by the immunolocalization of signaling proteins such as G&#x003b1;<sub>gust</sub>, T2R, PLC&#x003b2;2 and the IP<sub>3</sub>III receptor in solitary intestinal epithelial cells and in cells of the respiratory system.)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. In accordance with these earlier findings, Bezen&#x000e7;on et al. took advantage of TRPM5 promoter-based eGFP transgenic mice and identified GFP-positive cells in the gastrointestinal tract which partially co-express a set of taste signaling proteins mentioned above [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>].</p><p>These observations are in line with our data demonstrating TRPM5 expression in scattered epithelial cells of the respiratory system and gastrointestinal tract. The cell body of TRPM5-enriched cells is bottle-shaped. The apical elongated narrow cell pole directly contacts the lumen and protrudes beyond the neighboring epithelial cells. On the basolateral cell pole, TRPM5-expressing cells have a long process contacting the lamina propria. Thus, the distribution and morphological characteristics of TRPM5-immunopositive cells conspicuously share numerous features with brush cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. To identify the cellular origin of TRPM5-immunopositive cells, we resorted to double immunofluorescence staining using antibodies directed against villin or CK18, proteins known to be enriched in brush cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. We observed an invariable co-localization of these marker proteins with TRPM5 in the respiratory system and a predominant co-localization in the duodenum.</p><p>Brush cells were initially defined by morphological criteria, and a clear biological role of this cell population still remains elusive. Hypotheses about these cells' functional role range from absorptive processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>], mechanosensation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>], secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>] or a contribution to the local immunological defense barrier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>]. In the respiratory system and the gastrointestinal tract, brush cells may play a role in sensation of chemical compounds in the lumen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>]. The latter notion is derived from two salient observations: Firstly, brush cells display morphological features similar to TRC. Both cell types are characterized by an apical tuft of stiff microvilli with long rootlets into the cytoplasm lacking classical exocytotic vesicles or synapses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Secondly, several signaling proteins pertinent to taste perception were identified in a subset of brush cells, including &#x003b1;-gustducin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and NO-synthase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>]. To our knowledge, TRPM5 is the first protein identified to be specifically expressed in brush cells of the gastrointestinal tract and the respiratory system. These results lend further support to the view that taste cells and brush cells share a common functional principle, i.e. chemosensation, and that brush cells are an important cellular correlate for chemosensation in the periphery.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The abundant and specific expression of TRPM5 in taste receptor cells, the VNO and the olfactory epithelium is consistent with the assumption that TRPM5 has a common functional role in sensation of taste compounds, olfaction of odorants and pheromones. TRPM5 is the first protein identified to show high and invariable enrichment in brush cells of the gastrointestinal tract and the respiratory system. Our data are suggestive of brush cells as a specialized population of epithelial cells potentially involved in chemosensation and of TRPM5 as a characteristic molecular constituent of the sensory machinery of these cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Antibodies and chemicals</title><p>The following antibodies were used: mouse anti-villin (clone ID2C3, Immunotech, Coulter, Marseille, France), mouse anti-cytokeratin 18 (CK18) (clone CY-90, Sigma, St. Louis, USA), goat anti-rabbit IgG/horseradish peroxidase conjugate (Bio Rad, Munich, Germany), goat anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to Alexa488 (Molecular Probes, Leiden, Netherlands), fluorescein-isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled donkey anti-mouse antibody f(ab')<sub>2</sub>-fragment (Dianova, Hamburg, Germany) and indocarbocyanin (Cy3)-labeled donkey anti-rabbit antibody (Chemicon, Hampshire, United Kingdom).
