Sixty subjects reacted only with Arg<sub>325</sub> constructs, 31 with Trp<sub>325</sub> only, and 1 with Gln<sub>325</sub> only. The restriction to either Arg<sub>325</sub> or Trp<sub>325</sub> corresponded with inheritance of the respective C- or T-alleles. A strong gene dosage effect was also evident because both Arg- and Trp-restricted ZnT8As were less prevalent in heterozygous than homozygous individuals.

Susceptibility to the disease is associated with multiple genetic loci, most prominently HLA alleles encoding particular major histocompatibility complex class II glycoproteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>).</p><p>ZnT8 is a newly discovered target of type 1 diabetes autoimmunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>) localized to the insulin granule of the pancreatic &#x003b2;-cell. It is encoded by <italic>SLC30A8</italic>, one of nine human genes for multispanning transmembrane proteins facilitating Zn<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> efflux from the cell and sequestration into intracellular compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>). Recent genome-wide association studies demonstrate association of ZnT8 gene polymorphisms with human type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>), notably a nonsynonymous SNP encoding either Arg or Trp at aa<sub>325</sub>. The major, Arg<sub>325</sub>-encoding C-allele confers a minor risk (odds ratio 1.07&#x02013;1.18) of disease. In nondiabetic subjects with a family history of type 2 diabetes, the C-allele was associated with increased insulin sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>), increased circulating proinsulin-to-insulin ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>), and decreased insulin responses in intravenous glucose tolerance tests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>), indicating a dominant effect on insulin secretion, &#x003b2;-cell mass, or both.</p><p>We report here that the type 1 diabetes autoimmune response to ZnT8 is focused on a few key epitopes, two of which are defined by the polymorphic aa<sub>325</sub> residue. To our knowledge, this is the first reported instance where a polymorphic variant determines the specificity of the autoimmune response. It indicates that the autoreactive B-lymphocyte repertoire is restricted to a few ZnT8 epitopes and is truly self-reactive as opposed to arising as a bystander response to a foreign antigen.</p><sec><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><p>Serum samples (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 421) were obtained within 2 weeks of type 1 diabetes diagnosis from patients attending the Barbara Davis Center (median age 11.3 years &#x0005b;range 0.6&#x02013;58&#x0005d;), 87&#x00025; Caucasian, and 6.3&#x00025; Hispanic). The 150 control subjects (median age 13.1 years &#x0005b;1&#x02013;55&#x0005d;), 72&#x00025; Caucasian, and 15.1&#x00025; Hispanic) were parents and children in the Diabetes Autoimmunity Study in the Young (DAISY) general population cohort and parents of the sibling/offspring cohort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>). The male-to-female sex ratio in both groups was 0.8. Informed consent was obtained under approved institutional review board oversight.</p><p>Genomic DNA was extracted from heparinized blood from 352 of the above type 1 diabetes patients using standard procedures. Polymorphic variations in the SLC30A8 gene were determined by qPCR using Taqman probes and an ABI7000 (ABI, Waltham, MA) targeting the nonsynonymous SNPs rs13266634, rs2466295 in the 3&#x02032; untranslated region, and rs6469675 in intron 2. Ascertainment rates were &#x0003e;99&#x00025;.</p><p>ZnT8 autoantibody (ZnT8A) radioimmunoprecipitation assays used <sup>35</sup>S-Met&#x02013;labeled in vitro transcribed and translated probes of hZnT8 COOH-terminal cytosolic segments (aa268&#x02013;369) encoding the aa<sub>325</sub> codon variants CCG (Arg), TCG (Trp), and CAG (Gln) (supplementary <xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, available in an online appendix at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.2337/db08-0522">http://dx.doi.org/10.2337/db08-0522</ext-link>). Assay procedures have previously been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>). ZnT8A assay data were normalized to a panreactive positive control sera (1:50) generated in rabbits to a glutathione-S-transferase/C-term Trp<sub>325</sub> fusion protein and 16 human control sera in the same assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>). Recombinant NUS-ZnT8 fusion proteins were generated in pET43.1 (EMD Biosciences, San Diego, CA), expressed in BL-21(DE3) <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, and purified by Ni-NTA agarose chromatography (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Synthetic 20-mer peptides were from Sigma Genosys (Woodlands, TX). For preabsorption, sera (5 &#x003bc;l) were preincubated with 10 &#x003bc;g protein or peptide in 40 &#x003bc;l PBS at 20&#x000b0;C for 2 h before addition of the radiolabeled antigen to initiate the assay. Results are expressed as means &#x000b1; SD; statistical analyses were performed with the Prism 4.0 software package (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.graphpad.com">www.graphpad.com</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS</title><p>The present study was initiated to resolve a paradoxical finding that two constructs bearing the COOH-terminal antigenic region of ZnT8 with or without the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminus (supplementary Fig. 1) were recognized in a differential fashion by subsets of type 1 diabetes new-onset sera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>). The constructs were derived from different cDNAs and subsequently shown to encode the Arg (C-probe) or Trp (NC-probe) variants of aa<sub>325</sub>. To further explore this phenomenon, assays were performed in sera from newly diagnosed type 1 diabetic patients using COOH-terminal ZnT8 probes bearing Arg, Trp, or Gln at aa<sub>325</sub>: 259 of 421 individuals (61.5&#x00025;) reacted to at least one probe, with the highest response recorded in reaction to the Arg variant (53.2&#x00025;) followed by Trp (43.9&#x00025;) and Gln (33.7&#x00025;) (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001, &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup>). Analysis of the overlap in responses (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref>) shows that some individuals react to the Arg or Trp probes alone and very rarely to Gln alone; 29.7&#x00025; of individuals reacted to all three probes.</p><p>A comparison of the levels of autoantibody reactivity to the Arg and Gln probes (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>B</italic></xref>) showed that the majority of individuals either reacted equivalently to the probes (falling within the bounds of the diagonal of the <italic>x</italic>-<italic>y</italic> plot &#x000b1; 3 SD) or responded to the Arg probe alone. Trp and Gln reactivities (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>C</italic></xref>) were similarly separated. Of the 34 patients who reacted equivalently to Arg and Trp probes (within the bounds of the diagonal &#x000b1; 3 SD of <xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>D</italic></xref>), 29 (85.3&#x00025;) had an equivalent response as determined by the Gln probe. This indicated that for these individuals, the aa at position 325 was not a determinant of autoantibody reactivity. A series of preabsorption experiments was therefore performed using peptides and recombinant proteins as competing ligands (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Selected type 1 diabetes sera that reacted with the Arg probe alone were blocked by recombinant NUS-C-term Arg<sub>325</sub> protein but not by NUS-C-term Trp<sub>325</sub> or NUS-C-term Gln<sub>325</sub>. Similarly, Trp-only responses were blocked by NUS-C-term Trp<sub>325</sub> but not NUS-C-term Arg<sub>325</sub> or NUS-C-term Gln<sub>325</sub>. Sera that reacted equivalently to Arg, Trp, and Gln probes were blocked by any of the NUS-C-term ZnT8 recombinants. Overlapping 20-mer peptides spanning the ZnT8 COOH-terminal from 268&#x02013;369 did not compete for reactivity, suggesting that the epitopes were conformational rather than linear. Overall, these results suggest that ZnT8A reactivity could be accounted for by three classes of conformational epitopes: one for which Arg<sub>325</sub> was an essential determinant, a second Trp<sub>325</sub> restricted, and a third not affected by aa<sub>325</sub>.</p><p>The relationship between ZnT8 autoantibody reactivity and genetic variation at the <italic>SLC30A8</italic> locus was examined using the SNP (rs13266634) encoding the Arg/Trp<sub>325</sub> variant and two adjacent noncoding SNPs identified in a type 2 diabetes genome-wide association study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>), rs2466295, located 259 bp distally in the 3&#x02032; UTR, and rs6469675, located 19635 bp proximally in intron 2. The minor allele frequency (MAF) for rs13266634 in our type 1 diabetic population of 0.266 (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 351) approximated the reference frequency of 0.256 (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 168) for Europeans in the NLM SNP database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/snpref.cgi?rs=13266634">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/snpref.cgi?rs&#x0003d;13266634</ext-link>). The distribution of genotypes (55.3&#x00025; CC, 36.2&#x00025; CT, and 8.5&#x00025; TT) was consistent with Hardy-Weinberg distribution (53.9, 39.0, and 7.1, respectively). Similar correlations were observed for the MAF for rs6469675 (0.285 vs. 0.220 in our study vs. the NLM SNP database, respectively) and rs2466295 (0.361 vs. 0.407).</p><p>The specificity of the ZnT8A response reflected the rs13266634 genotype (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>), with little or no association observed with the adjacent rs2466295 and rs6469675 SNPs. The ZnT8A response assessed by the Gln probe showed no significant variation with the rs13266634 genotype, whereas responses to the Arg probe were highest in CC homozygotes, lowest in TT homozygotes, and intermediate in the heterozygote group. Conversely, responses to the Trp probe were highest in TT homozygotes, lowest in CC, homozygotes, and intermediate in heterozygotes. An even stronger relationship with genotype was seen in the groups having only Arg<sub>325</sub>- and Trp<sub>325</sub>-restricted responses. Arg<sub>325</sub>-only responses were observed only in individuals bearing the rs13266634 C-allele, with a 4.2-fold higher frequency in homozygotes than heterozygotes. With one exception, all Trp<sub>325</sub>-restricted responses were associated with the rs13266634 T-allele, with a 10.2-fold higher frequency in homozygotes than heterozygotes. The single Gln<sub>325</sub>-restricted ZnT8A patient (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref>) was genotyped CC, confirmed by sequencing. The small number of sera positive for both Trp<sub>325</sub> and Arg<sub>325</sub> but not Gln<sub>325</sub> probes were associated with heterozygote genotypes (11 of 13 cases) as expected (data not shown). The prevalence of insulin autoantibody, GAD antibody, or IA-2 antigen response did not change as a function of rs13266634 genotype.</p><p>The median age of onset of disease in the genotyped individuals was 11.2 years (range 0.6&#x02013;58), with more than half (57.3&#x00025;) diagnosed between ages 8 and 16 years and 88.9&#x00025; before age 18 years. A frequency distribution analysis based on binning at 4-year intervals showed no statistically significant difference in the representation of the CC, CT, and TT genotypes at any age of onset, though a trend was observed for a higher CC and lower CT genotype frequency in the youngest onset group (0.6&#x02013;4 years) compared with that of a 5- to 15-year-old reference group (Fishers exact test, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003d; 0.24; <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 219) (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>A</italic></xref>).</p><p>The prevalence of ZnT8A measured with Gln<sub>325</sub>, Arg<sub>325</sub>, and Trp<sub>325</sub> COOH-terminal probes increased with increasing age of onset, reached a plateau at 8&#x02013;16 years, and then fell (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>C</italic> and <italic>D</italic></xref>). Arg<sub>325</sub>- and Trp<sub>325</sub>-restricted responses were observed in all age-groups, but the low numbers of positive individuals did not permit ascertainment of changes in prevalence and levels of reactivity in association with age (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>D</italic></xref>). The autoantibody responses to insulin, GAD65, and IA-2 showed characteristic changes in prevalence relative to age of onset of disease, insulin autoantibody prevalence being highest in younger onset patients, IA-2 antibody tending to be higher in adolescents than children, and GAD antibody showing little variation (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>B</italic></xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The COOH-terminal domain of ZnT8 to which type 1 diabetes autoantibodies bind (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>) incorporates a conserved protein fold found in the large family of cation diffusion facilitator efflux carriers and has orthologs in all cellular organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>). Autoantibodies to ZnT8 in human type 1 diabetic patients, however, show little cross-reactivity to other human Zn transporters or even to mouse ZnT8, which is 82&#x00025; identical in sequence. Even more remarkable, we show here that the amino acid encoded by a common polymorphism in human ZnT8 at aa<sub>325</sub> is a key determinant of two of the three major conformational epitopes in the protein. Given that antibody responses in any individual are polyclonal and the structural variation in the antibody repertoire that occurs between genetically identical individuals, such epitope restriction is remarkable and, in light of this, are termed iso-epitopes. Polymorphic variants of other diabetes-related autoantigens exist, but to our knowledge none have been implicated as determinants of humoral autoreactivity, though clearly this bears further scrutiny.</p><p>The autoantibody responses to the ZnT8 Arg- and Trp-restricted isoepitopes segregated with the alleles encoding the respective variant amino acids, indicating that humoral type 1 diabetes autoimmunity to ZnT8 is directed against self and not nonself epitope determinants. This argues against the molecular mimicry hypothesis that suggests that autoimmunity is triggered by an initial immune response to a infectious agent that in turn triggers reactivity to self because of sequence homology between the pathological agent and a self protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>). Our results favor the idea that ZnT8 autoreactivity arises because of a defect in induction of self-tolerance, since the mimicry model would more likely favor one isoepitope over another, which in turn would be manifest as genetic dissociation of the encoding allele with the disease. The MAF of the rs13266634 SNP in the type 1 diabetic population under study was, however, similar to reference populations, and no association of the SNP was seen with age of diabetes onset or the prevalence of antibodies to ZnT8 or other diabetes autoantigens. We cannot, however, preclude a role for molecular mimicry in T-cell recognition of antigenic peptides or in antigen presentation to CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T-cells because antigen/antibody binding can directly influence the peptides presented from the antigen by virtue of altering intracellular proteolytic processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>).</p><p>While the rs13266634 genotype or ZnT8 isoepitope specificites may not markedly affect type 1 diabetes susceptibility or age of onset, their measurement will be important in a number of clinical settings. Since ZnT8 autoantibodies provide an independent marker of disease susceptibility in pre-diabetic individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>), measurements based on a single aa<sub>325</sub> probe would underestimate ZnT8 autoimmunity by as much as 20&#x00025; given the differences in rs13266634 SNP allele frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>) and thus affect inclusion in clinical trials. Given its high tissue specificity, ZnT8 is an attractive candidate as a component of a DNA- or peptide-based vaccine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>) to prevent or retard the onset of type 1 diabetes. In this context, it is likely to be important to match the molecular form of the antigen to the recipient because mismatching the isoepitope might lead to immunization and acceleration of disease rather than induction of tolerance.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Online-Only Appendix</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="db08-0522_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword" xlink:href="db08-0522_db08-0522[1].supplfig1.doc"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was supported by the Childhood Diabetes Foundation in Denver, the University of Colorado Health Sciences Diabetes and Endocrinology Research Center (National Institutes of Health &#x0005b;NIH&#x0005d; P30 DK57516), NIH R01 DK052068, and a Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation Center grant.
