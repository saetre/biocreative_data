It has been proposed that the <italic>ori</italic> DNA is first melted by a head-to-tail double trimer of E1 that evolves into two hexamers that encircle and unwind DNA bi-directionally. Here the role of a conserved lysine residue in the smaller tier or collar of the E1 helicase domain in <italic>ori</italic> processing is described. Unlike the residues of the AAA+ domain DNA-binding segments (&#x003b2;-hairpin and hydrophobic loop; larger tier), this residue functions in the initial melting of duplex <italic>ori</italic> DNA but not in the processive DNA unwinding of partially single-stranded test substrates. These data therefore define a new DNA-binding related activity in the E1 protein and demonstrate that separate functional elements for DNA melting and helicase activity can be distinguished. New insights into the mechanism of <italic>ori</italic> melting are elaborated, suggesting the coordinated involvement of rigid and flexible DNA-binding components in E1.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The initiation of DNA replication begins with the recruitment of specific proteins to defined sequences and is followed by the melting of the origin (<italic>ori</italic>) of replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). How initiators melt DNA is poorly understood but protein-induced looping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>), wrapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4 B5 B6">4&#x02013;6</xref>) or encircling of the DNA can distort and melt DNA. Large T antigen (LTag) and E1, the initiator proteins of SV40 and papillomavirus respectively, both encircle DNA when melting it. The replication mechanisms of these viruses have received much attention as their genomes are regulated like that of the mammalian host cells they infect, and because the papillomaviruses are important disease organisms in man. LTag and E1 both assemble as multi-protein complexes at their respective <italic>oris</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>), and melt the DNA either side of their initiator-binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>).</p><p>The bovine papillomavirus (BPV-1) replication initiation complex assembles in a stepwise fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). E1 is first recruited as a dimer to two binding sites in <italic>ori</italic> by the viral transcription factor E2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11 B12 B13">11&#x02013;13</xref>). In a subsequent ATP-dependent reaction, E2 is displaced and more E1 molecules are recruited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). The initial complex that forms is stable in the presence of ATP but does not melt the DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). The sequence-specific DNA-binding domain (DBD) of E1 performs an essential function in this process, targeting E1 to a third and fourth binding site in the E1 recognition sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). The next step in initiation is the transition from tetramer to double trimer (DT) with the concomitant melting of the <italic>ori</italic> DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>), and occupation of a fifth and sixth binding site by the E1 DBD. In a process so far unique to the DNA tumour viruses, the melted DNA then becomes the substrate upon which a replicative helicase forms from the <italic>ori</italic>-melting complex. The active form of the helicase is a hexamer and two hexamers unwind the DNA bi-directionally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). Indeed, the concerted action of two hexameric helicases is not limited to replication, as two hexameric helicases also drive branch migration during recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). This could suggest that the functioning of hexameric helicases in pairs is a more general phenomenon.</p><p>A mechanistic understanding of these processes has benefited from the determination of the three-dimensional crystal structures of the BPV-1 E1 DBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>), fragments of an E1-E2 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>), and more recently the structure of the E1 helicase domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). Like the LTag helicase domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>) the E1 helicase domain (HD, residues 299&#x02013;605) assembles to form a hexamer with a large and small tier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). With and without co-factors and DNA the N-terminal domains of E1 HD (residues &#x0223c;300&#x02013;378) form a near symmetrical ring or &#x02018;rigid collar&#x02019;, while the ATP<italic>ase</italic> or AAA+ domains (residues 379&#x02013;605) are arranged asymmetrically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). Two DNA-binding segments in the AAA+ domain have been identified; a &#x003b2;-hairpin (residues 505&#x02013;509) and a &#x02018;hydrophobic loop&#x02019; (residues 457&#x02013;467), that have functional equivalents in LTag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). A conserved lysine and phenylalanine (K506 and F464 in BPV) are critical for both helicase activity and DNA melting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). In the E1/ADP/DNA hexamer these residues form the principal contacts with ssDNA passing through a central tunnel, and follow a wave-like path correlating with ATP, ADP and apo-configurations of the nucleotide-binding sites at the subunit interfaces. Although these data illuminate an attractive mechanism for nucleotide-coupled ssDNA translocation through the helicase, models for DNA melting are fragmentary. Here I show that a conserved lysine residue, K356 in the E1 HD collar domain, that has its side chain exposed in the central tunnel of the E1 hexamer is important for the melting of duplex <italic>ori</italic> DNA but not processive DNA strand separation initiated on partially single-stranded DNA test substrates. These data suggest that the E1 HD collar and AAA+ domains both posses DNA-binding functions that act in concert when E1 melts <italic>ori</italic>. The propensity of the collar domains to form a symmetrical structure while the AAA+ domains are inherently flexible suggests a &#x02018;clamp and twist&#x02019; mechanism for dsDNA remodelling by an E1-<italic>ori</italic> complex. <fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Conserved structural features of the E1 hexamer DNA-binding tunnel.

Both of these structures project into the central tunnel formed by E1 hexamerisation and follow a wave-like trajectory along its longitudinal axis, contacting ssDNA directly in the E1/ADP/DNA crystal structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). Further inspection of this structure reveals two additional lysine residues in the smaller E1 HD N-terminal collar domain, K356 and K359, whose side chains also point directly into the tunnel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). Unlike the residues of the AAA+ domain DNA-binding sites, these amino acids do not follow a wave-like path but form a ring dictated by the near-symmetry of the collar domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A and B). Direct contacts of K356 or K359 with DNA were not observed in the E1/ADP/DNA crystal structure and no clear electron density corresponding to DNA was apparent in this domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). Alignment of papillomavirus E1 amino acid sequences reveals that lysine is highly conserved at positions analogous to BPV residues 356 and 359. With only one exception in all available sequences (glutamine), arginine is the only other amino acid frequently found at either position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C).</p></sec><sec><title>Helicase activity of E1 collar domain mutants</title><p>Helicase activity of E1 collar domain mutants was assessed by measuring the displacement of a <sup>32</sup>P-labelled 70 base DNA strand annealed to a 115 base strand, forming a substrate with a 45 base 3&#x02032; overhang (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). At the lowest concentration of protein tested (50 nM), the helicase activity of mutants K356A, K356E and K356Q was slightly lower than wild-type (reduced approximately 30% in the case of K356E), while the conservative substitution K356R and K359A appeared more active than wild-type. At 200 nM E1, the unwinding activity of wild-type E1 and all mutants (lanes 6&#x02013;20) was similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B), with inhibition of the unwinding reaction at high protein concentrations. As has been shown previously, full-length E1 proteins with mutations in the AAA+ domain DNA-binding segments (K506 and F464), purified similarly, were inactive for unwinding (data not shown). Therefore, mutation of residues K356 and K359 does not impact significantly on E1 helicase activity initiated on partially single-stranded DNA test substrates. <fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Helicase activity of E1 and collar domain mutants.

In the KMnO<sub>4</sub> assay, T residues in unwound DNA become hyper-reactive to oxidation and modified bases can be detected following cleavage with pipiridine. As has been demonstrated previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>), E1 <italic>ori</italic> melting is evident as thymidine cleavage products upstream and downstream of the E1-binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A lanes 2&#x02013;4; A/T-rich region and nucleotides 20, 26/27). Of the K356 mutants tested, the conservative substitution K356R behaved like wild-type (lanes 11&#x02013;13), while K356E failed to induce the extended permanganate hyper-reactivity over the A/T-rich region. Weak KMnO<sub>4</sub> reactivity was however apparent downstream of the E1-binding site at nucleotides 20, 26 and 27 (lanes 8&#x02013;10). The extent of <italic>ori</italic> melting by K356Q (lanes 14&#x02013;16) and K356A (lanes 5&#x02013;7) was reduced compared to wild-type, with the K356A consistently more defective than the glutamine substitution. The <italic>ori</italic>-melting activity of K359A was similar to wild-type (lanes 17&#x02013;19). The gel-shift analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B) demonstrated that of all the mutant proteins only K356E showed a modest (less than twofold) decrease in dsDNA-binding activity, hence the defects in <italic>ori</italic> melting are not a result of a primary defect in E1-<italic>ori</italic> DNA binding. However, it is notable that only lower order complexes appear to be generated in the gel-shift for K356E (lanes 8&#x02013;10), as judged by the mobility of gel-shift complexes compared to wild-type. These data therefore indicate that a basic residue at position 356 is required for efficient DNA melting, while the opposing charge (glutamate) is inhibitory. <fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Initiator activity of E1 collar domain mutants.

Substrate unwinding by mutant K356Q (lanes 18&#x02013;21) was impaired but to a lesser extent than K356A (lanes 6&#x02013;9). The fragment unwinding activities of the collar domain mutants therefore parallel the defects observed in the KMnO<sub>4</sub> DNA melting assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A). Since all mutants are capable of processive DNA unwinding, with similar activities at high protein concentrations, when unwinding is initiated directly from a substrate with an ssDNA tail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>), the fragment unwinding activities observed here are probably a measure of replication initiation.

The initial recruitment of two E1 monomers to two E1-binding sites requires the viral transcription factor E2 that is displaced upon binding of E1 to additional sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). This E1-<italic>ori</italic> complex that forms is stable, but does not effectively generate the permanganate hyper-reactivity over the A/T-rich region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Progression to a double-trimer (DT) and melting of <italic>ori</italic> are co-ordinated events requiring the DNA-binding segments of the E1 ATP<italic>ase</italic>/AAA+ portion of the E1HD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). The data presented here demonstrate the existence of an additional DNA-binding function in the collar domain of the E1 HD entailing residue K356 that is also required for <italic>ori</italic> melting. The analysis performed <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> under physiologically relevant conditions, i.e. the presence of ATP, revealed stalling of E1-<italic>ori</italic> complex formation for the mutant K356E at the level of an E1-<italic>ori</italic> pre-initiation complex.</p><sec><title>Nature of the E1-<italic>ori</italic> pre-initiation complex</title><p>Extensive high-resolution hydroxyl radical footprinting experiments have been performed with the E1 DBD and E1/E1E2 pre-initiation complexes. The periodic OH protection pattern observed for the E1-<italic>ori</italic> pre-initiation complex generated from E1E2-<italic>ori</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>), closely resembles that of the E1-<italic>ori</italic> complex that forms without nucleotide co-factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>), and for mutants in the E1HD DNA-binding domains [K356E, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref> and the AAA+ domain &#x003b2;-hairpin (K506) and hydrophobic loop (F464), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>)]. In each case, protection over the E1 recognition motif is consistent with a tetramer of E1-binding sites 1&#x02013;4 (of six) via the sequence-specific DBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>), with the additional flanking protections generated by the non-specific DNA-binding segments of the E1 HD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). The periodic nature of this OH footprinting pattern and the crystal structure of an E1 DBD tetramer bound to DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>) both indicate that encircling of the DNA is incomplete at this stage. However, structural changes in the template have begun. Distortions of the DNA helix are apparent in the E1-DNA co-crystal structure and limited KMnO<sub>4</sub> hyper-reactivity is induced by E1-<italic>ori</italic> formed without nucleotide cofactors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Permanganate hyper-reactive sites are observed at nucleotide 7934, between the A/T-rich region and E1 recognition motif, and within the downstream E2BS. The latter are also induced by the HD collar and AAA+ domain DNA-binding mutants, particularly at nucleotide 20 but also 26 and 27 [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>)]. Thus limited structural distortion of <italic>ori</italic> is a feature shared between the tetrameric pre-initiation complexes that can form under various conditions (directly from E1E2-<italic>ori</italic>, or without nucleotide cofactor) and with various mutants in the HD non-specific DNA-binding segments.</p></sec><sec><title>Nature of the collar domain DNA-binding function</title><p>Oligomerisation and encircling of ds- and ssDNA by E1-<italic>ori</italic> melting and helicase complexes is a feature associated with their respective activities. Subunit interactions are thus critical components of these DNA-binding assemblies. The data presented here demonstrate a role for K356 in dsDNA binding and melting. Unlike the previously characterised mutants in the AAA+ domain DNA-binding segments [K506 and F464 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>)], the DNA-binding defects of the K356 mutants do not correlate also with incapacitating defects in helicase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). The mutant K356E demonstrated a modest (&#x0223c;twofold) decrease in dsDNA-binding activity, while K356A and K356Q bound the <italic>ori</italic> probe as effectively as wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). This suggests a role for K356 in forming a DNA-binding site, most likely through electrostatic interactions with the DNA, as highlighted by the severity of the K356E defect in DNA melting. It is possible that the non-conservative K356 mutations also affect the oligomerisation of E1 required to assemble the DNA-binding function. The observation that K356A, K356E and K356Q all have slightly reduced helicase activities compared to wild-type at low E1 concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B; &#x0223c;30% maximum measured at 50 nM E1), may indicate a minor impairment in monomer&#x02013;monomer interactions. However, it should be noted that these defects are not commensurate with the defects in duplex DNA melting, particularly for K356E that completely fails to melt double-stranded <italic>ori</italic> DNA. Also, the K356 side chain points directly into the central tunnel generated by E1 hexamerisation and does not appear to mediate any principal monomer&#x02013;monomer contacts. More importantly, K356E and K356A have very similar helicase activities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>) but significantly different dsDNA-binding properties: K356E appears to form lower order complexes in the gel-shift assay shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B, even at high protein concentrations, generates a periodic OH footprinting pattern and completely fails to melt duplex <italic>ori</italic> DNA. On the other hand for K356A (and also K356Q), quantitative and qualitative defects in dsDNA binding are hard to discern by footprinting and gel-shift analysis, yet the defects in DNA melting are significant. Together, these observations are more readily reconcilable with a direct interaction of the K356 side chain with DNA during duplex opening, rather than a definitive contribution to monomer&#x02013;monomer interactions and oligomerisation.</p><p>It is possible that residues in the collar domain other than K356 also contribute to DNA binding, although the data rule out the conserved lysine at position 359. All non-conservative K356 mutations tested showed a partial (K356A and K356Q) or complete (K356E) inability to melt <italic>ori</italic> over the A/T-rich region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). However, only K356E generated the periodic OH protection pattern associated with the tetrameric pre-initiation complex at high protein concentrations, while all other mutants protected the DNA like wild-type. The similar OH protection patterns (absence of a partial or mixed footprint) would argue that the composition of all complexes that melt DNA is similar i.e. the DT forms. This would allow consideration of the melting activity of mutants in terms of specific activity, with various determinants contributing incrementally to generation of a stable unwound structure.</p><p>Amino-acid sequence comparisons with LTag do not readily reveal a potential functional equivalent of K356 alluding to a similar DNA-binding function in the collar domain of this protein. However, the sequences align poorly in this region and the three-dimensional arrangement of the LTag collar domain is different to E1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). None the less, the inner tunnel of the LTag hexamer is highly positively charged, indicating a likely contribution to the ss- and dsDNA-binding functions of LTag complexes.</p></sec><sec><title>Implications for the mechanism of <italic>ori</italic> melting</title><p>DNA-binding elements residing in three separate domains of E1 (DBD, collar and AAA+ domains) cooperate to melt <italic>ori</italic>, but exactly how this occurs upon DT formation is unclear. In the hexameric E1 helicase structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>) the domains of the collar adopt a symmetrical conformation while the AAA+ domains are arranged asymmetrically. Rotation of the AAA+ domains by up to 14&#x000b0; result in positional deviations of up to 7.5 &#x000c5;, and this flexibility appears to be an intrinsic feature of E1 assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). There are no structures available for the E1 DT, but the requirement for a nucleotide (ATP or ADP <italic>in vitro</italic>) in stabilising the DT complex suggests intimate contacts between subunits. It is possible that the collar domains of the E1HD adopt a symmetrical configuration, while the AAA+ domain DNA-binding segments assemble asymmetrically, tracking the DNA bases along a helical trajectory as in the E1/ADP/DNA hexamer. As such, the DNA-binding modes of the HD collar and sequence-specific DBD could be viewed as a fixed clamp, while the flexible AAA+ domains are free to rotate. A rotational movement of the AAA+ domain, stabilised by nucleotide binding, may then untwist the DNA where extended permanganate hypersensitivity is measured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). Further evaluation of the mechanism should be made possible with the new mutants described here. <fig id="F7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p>Proposed mechanism for melting of the BPV origin of replication. The DT <italic>ori</italic> melting complex is derived from a tetrameric pre-initiation complex. Three separate DNA-binding modules are required for melting: The sequence-specific DBD bound to the E1BS and binding sites in the collar and AAA+ portions of the helicase domain. On the basis of the rigid nature of the collar and DBD modules, these are proposed to form a clamp on the DNA about which rotation of the AAA+ domain induce untwisting of the DNA. A bound nucleotide (ATP or ADP) stabilises the unwound configuration.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkn041f7"/></fig></p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>This work was supported by Yorkshire Cancer Research grant S284.
