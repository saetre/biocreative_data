One theory is that multiple genetic hits to the host immune system may contribute to the susceptibility and severity of IBD. However, experimental proof of this concept is still lacking. Several genetic mouse models that each recapitulate some aspects of human IBD have utilized a single gene defect to induce colitis. However, none have produced pathology clearly distinguishable as either ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease, in part because none of them reproduce the most severe forms of disease that are observed in human patients. This lack of severe IBD models has posed a challenge for research into pathogenic mechanisms and development of new treatments. We hypothesized that multiple genetic hits to the regulatory machinery that normally inhibits immune activation in the intestine would generate more severe, reproducible pathology that would mimic either ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Methods and Findings</title><p>We generated a novel mouse line (dnKO) that possessed defects in both TGF&#x003b2;RII and IL-10R2 signaling. These mice rapidly and reproducibly developed a disease resembling fulminant human ulcerative colitis that was quite distinct from the much longer and more variable course of pathology observed previously in mice possessing only single defects. Pathogenesis was driven by uncontrolled production of proinflammatory cytokines resulting in large part from T cell activation. The disease process could be significantly ameliorated by administration of antibodies against IFN&#x003b3; and TNF&#x003b1; and was completely inhibited by a combination of broad-spectrum antibiotics.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Here, we develop to our knowledge the first mouse model of fulminant ulcerative colitis by combining multiple genetic hits in immune regulation and demonstrate that the resulting disease is sensitive to both anticytokine therapy and broad-spectrum antibiotics. These findings indicated the IL-10 and TGF&#x003b2; pathways synergize to inhibit microbially induced production of proinflammatory cytokines, including IFN&#x003b3; and TNF&#x003b1;, which are known to play a role in the pathogenesis of human ulcerative colitis. Our findings also provide evidence that broad-spectrum antibiotics may have an application in the treatment of patients with ulcerative colitis. This model system will be useful in the future to explore the microbial factors that induce immune activation and characterize how these interactions produce disease.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>Paul Allen and colleagues describe the development of a mouse model of fulminant ulcerative colitis with multiple genetic hits in immune regulation which can be moderated by anti-cytokine therapy and broad-spectrum antibiotics.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="editor"><title>Editors' Summary</title><sec id="sb1a"><title>Background.</title><p>Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), a group of disorders characterized by inflammation (swelling) of the digestive tract (the tube that runs from the mouth to the anus), affects about 1.4 million people in the US. There are two main types of IBD. In Crohn's disease, which can affect any area of the digestive tract but most commonly involves the lower part of the small intestine (small bowel), all the layers of the intestine become inflamed. In ulcerative colitis, which primarily affects the colon (large bowel) and the rectum (the part of the bowel closest to the anus), only the lining of the bowel becomes inflamed, the cells in this lining die, and sores or ulcers form. Both types of IBD most commonly develop between the ages of 15 and 35 years, often run in families, and carry an increased risk of cancer. Symptoms&#x02014;usually diarrhea and abdominal cramps&#x02014;can be mild or severe and the disorder can develop slowly or suddenly. There is no medical cure for IBD, but drugs that modulate the immune system (for example, corticosteroids) can help some people. Some people benefit from treatment with drugs that specifically inhibit &#x0201c;proinflammatory cytokines,&#x0201d; proteins made by the immune system that stimulate inflammation (for example, TNF&#x003b1; and INF&#x003b3;). When medical therapy fails, surgery to remove the affected part of the bowel may be necessary.</p></sec><sec id="sb1b"><title>Why Was This Study Done?</title><p>Exactly what causes IBD is not clear, but people with IBD seem to have an overactive immune system. The immune system normally protects the body from harmful substances but in IBD it mistakenly recognizes the food substances and &#x0201c;good&#x0201d; bacteria that are normally present in the human gut as foreign and hence reacts against them. As a result, immune system cells accumulate in the lining of the bowel and cause inflammation. Several different pathways usually prevent inappropriate immune activation, so could IBD be caused by alterations in one or several of these immune regulatory pathways? In previous studies, mice with a defect in just one pathway have developed mild intestinal abnormalities but not the problems seen in the most severe forms of IBD. In this study, therefore, the researchers have generated and characterized a new mouse line with defects in two immune regulatory pathways to see whether this might be a better animal model of human IBD.</p></sec><sec id="sb1c"><title>What Did the Researchers Do and Find?</title><p>To make their new mouse line, the researchers mated mice that had a defective TGF&#x003b2; signaling pathway in their T lymphocytes with mice that had a defective IL-10 signaling pathway. Both these pathways are anti-inflammatory, and mice with defects in either pathway develop mild and variable inflammation of the colon (colitis) by age 3&#x02013;4 months. By contrast, the doubly defective mice (dnKO mice) failed to thrive, lost weight, and died by 4&#x02013;6 weeks of age. The colons of 4- to 5-week old dnKO mice were inflamed and ulcerated (some changes were visible in 3-week-old mice) and contained many immune system cells. Mice with a single defective signaling pathway had no gut abnormalities at this age. The dnKO mice, just like people with IBD, had higher than normal blood levels of IFN&#x003b3;, TNF&#x003b1;, and other proinflammatory cytokines; these raised levels were the result of abnormal lymphocyte activation. Treatment of the dnKO mice with a combination of agents that neutralize IFN&#x003b3; and TNF&#x003b1; (anti-cytokine therapy) greatly reduced the colitis seen in these mice; neutralization of IFN&#x003b3; alone had some beneficial effects, but neutralization of TNF&#x003b1; alone had no effect. Finally, early treatment of the dnKO mice with broad-spectrum antibiotics completely inhibited colitis.</p></sec><sec id="sb1d"><title>What Do These Findings Mean?</title><p>These findings suggest that dnKO mice are a good model for fulminant (severe and rapidly progressing) ulcerative colitis and support the idea that IBD involves multiple genetic defects in immune regulation. They also indicate that the IL-10 and the TGF&#x003b2; signaling pathways normally cooperate to inhibit the inappropriate immune responses to intestinal bacteria seen in IBD. This new mouse model should help researchers unravel what goes wrong in IBD and should also help them develop new treatments for ulcerative colitis. More immediately, these findings suggest that combined anti-cytokine therapy may be a better treatment for ulcerative colitis than single therapy. In addition, they suggest that clinical studies should be started to test whether broad-spectrum antibiotics can ameliorate ulcerative colitis in people.</p></sec><sec id="sb1e"><title>Additional Information.</title><p>Please access these Web sites via the online version of this summary at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0050041">http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0050041</ext-link>.</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The Medline Plus Encyclopedia has pages on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000249.htm">Crohn's disease</ext-link> and on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000250.htm">ulcerative colitis</ext-link> (in English and Spanish)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Information is available from the UK National Health Service Direct Health Encyclopedia about <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nhsdirect.nhs.uk/articles/article.aspx?articleId=115">Crohn's disease</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nhsdirect.nhs.uk/articles/article.aspx?articleId=381">ulcerative colitis </ext-link></p></list-item><list-item><p>The US National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases provides information on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://digestive.niddk.nih.gov/ddiseases/pubs/crohns">Crohn's disease</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://digestive.niddk.nih.gov/ddiseases/pubs/colitis/">ulcerative colitis</ext-link></p></list-item><list-item><p>Information and support for patients with inflammatory bowel disease and their caregivers is provided by the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ccfa.org/">Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America</ext-link> and by the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nacc.org.uk/">UK National Association for Colitis and Crohn's Disease</ext-link></p></list-item></list></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="16"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Kang SS, Bloom SM, Norian LA, Geske MJ, Flavell RA, et al.

Although the exact mechanisms for IBD induction and progression are not completely understood, unchecked immune responses to enteric bacteria are critical for pathogenesis (reviewed in &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050041-b001">1</xref>&#x0005d;). The clinical presentation of IBD occurs over a wide spectrum from chronic indolent to acute fulminant disease. A recent hypothesis is that susceptibility to disease, including the variation in presentation, may be a result of alterations of multiple pathways that control intestinal mucosal homeostasis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050041-b002">2</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>At least ten different murine models of IBD involving single gene manipulations have been developed and demonstrate the role for proper development/maintenance of specific subsets of T cells and control of inflammatory cytokine production in regulation of disease (reviewed in &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050041-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050041-b002">2</xref>&#x0005d;), as well as revealing a crucial role for enteric bacteria in inducing disease (e.g., &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050041-b003">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050041-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d;). While a variety of existing models recapitulate aspects of human IBD, many are limited by variable penetrance, delayed development of characteristic disease pathology, and, in some cases, induction of nonspecific severe multiorgan autoimmunity &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050041-b003">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050041-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050041-b007">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050041-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;. Additionally, none of these models consistently and predictably mimics the most severe and acute presentation of either ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease. This animal-to-animal variability in disease penetrance and severity poses a significant challenge for efforts to experimentally manipulate the course of disease in these models.</p><p>Because the current number of known genetic manipulations that can produce a partial IBD phenotype is at least ten, and the minimum number of multiple genetic hits is two, the resulting number of possible two-hit combinations is 45. We chose to utilize a model involving the loss of the IL-10 signaling pathway because uncharacterized loci that increased the severity of colitis in IL-10<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice have been defined using a genetic approach &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050041-b010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050041-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;. These findings support the hypothesis that alterations of multiple loci can exacerbate pathology both in mouse models and human IBD.

In addition to documenting these pathologic findings, we further show that disease in dnKO mice is characterized by elevated proinflammatory cytokines, can be induced in recipient animals by transfer of dnKO CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells, is responsive to combined neutralization of IFN&#x003b3; and TNF&#x003b1;, and can be completely inhibited through treatment with high-dose oral ciprofloxacin and metronidazole.</p><p>Previous work has shown that the inhibitory cytokines IL-10 and TGF&#x003b2;, both known to control immune homeostasis, are associated with protection from colitis in murine models of IBD &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050041-b007">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050041-b009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050041-b031">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050041-b035">35</xref>&#x0005d;. We crossed dnTGF&#x003b2;RII mice, which have significantly attenuated TGF&#x003b2;RII signaling in T cells, with IL-10R2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. The resulting dnKO mice showed a highly reproducible, diffuse, and severe ulcerative colitis that occurred in a predictable time frame. At the same time point at which dnKO mice developed severe disease and died, all controls including WT, dnTGF&#x003b2;RII, and IL-10R2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice demonstrated little to no pathology. Similarly, work in IL-10<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice has demonstrated differential colitis severity in a C3H/HeJBir versus a C57BL/6J background and linked the differences to a region on Chromosome 3, referred to as the cytokine deficiency-induced colitis susceptibility 1 (Cdcs1) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050041-b010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050041-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;. These findings all support the idea that IBD is a complex disease influenced by multiple interacting host genetic factors.</p><p>Because both dnTGF&#x003b2;RII and IL-10R2 signaling are important for various aspects of immune regulation, the disease observed in dnKO mice was likely due to a culmination of several dysregulated parameters. The recent generation of T cell specific TGF&#x003b2;RII knockout mice revealed that this defect alone was sufficient to induce rapid, multiorgan autoimmunity. These mice demonstrated alterations in Th1 T cell differentiation, NKT cell development, and impaired maintenance, but not generation, of Foxp3 regulatory T cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050041-b036">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050041-b037">37</xref>&#x0005d;. Similarly, in dnKO mice, regulatory T cells were present at similar percentages to controls, suggesting that regulatory T cell development was also intact in these mice. Furthermore, dnKO T regulatory cells were able to inhibit naive T cell proliferation in vitro, suggesting that they still are able to function in this context. Regulation of a T cell transfer model of colitis has previously been demonstrated to depend on TGF&#x003b2; responsiveness by pathogenic naive T cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050041-b031">31</xref>&#x0005d;, emphasizing the importance of this cytokine in disease inhibition. We showed that CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells from dnTGF&#x003b2;RII mice could also transfer disease, but found that the additional loss of IL-10R2 signaling increased the severity of disease above that conferred by cells in which only TGF&#x003b2;RII signaling was disrupted. These studies, however, did not address whether the loss of IL-10R2 and TGF&#x003b2;RII signaling caused dysregulation of the naive or regulatory T cell subsets found within the CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> population &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050041-b038">38</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>In addition to impaired TGF&#x003b2;RII signaling, IL-10R2 signaling was completely absent in dnKO mice. As a result, these mice were unresponsive to IL-10, which normally inhibits antigen-presenting cell function and may play a role in converting naive CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells to those with regulatory potential &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050041-b012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050041-b014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050041-b039">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050041-b042">42</xref>&#x0005d;. The importance of IL-10 in regulation of colitis was initially demonstrated in IL-10<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice that developed spontaneous enterocolitis marked by crypt abnormalities, epithelial hyperplasia, and leukocytic infiltrates &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050041-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d;. The generation of IL-10R2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice recapitulated data from IL-10<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice in that they also spontaneously developed colitis marked by epithelial hyperplasia and leukocytic infiltrates. Interestingly, IL-10 has also been implicated in contributing to epithelial barrier integrity &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050041-b043">43</xref>&#x0005d;, which would be a critical aspect in limiting intestinal mucosal inflammation.</p><p>Because the IL-10R2 is also a redundant receptor for other cytokines, including IL-22, IL-26, IL-28, and IL-29 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050041-b044">44</xref>&#x0005d;, the effects of these cytokines on colitis development in dnKO mice could not be ruled out. While little is known about the relevance of most of these cytokines in the context of intestinal immunity, increased levels of IL-22 have been noted in human IBD patients, and IL-22 has also been demonstrated to induce IL-10 expression by colon epithelial cell lines &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050041-b045">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050041-b046">46</xref>&#x0005d;. However, abrogation of signaling in these cells may be beneficial, as IL-22 has also been shown to induce production of proinflammatory cytokines by colonic subepithelial myofibroblasts and intestinal epithelial cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050041-b045">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050041-b047">47</xref>&#x0005d;. Additionally, previous characterization of IL-10R2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice did not reveal an increased disease severity compared to what was described for IL-10<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050041-b007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050041-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;. With the given caveat that there may have been differences in enteric flora, the data from these studies suggest that IL-10, but not the other redundant IL-10R2 cytokines, plays the predominant role in colitis induction and exacerbation.</p><p>In addition to potential alterations in APC function, epithelial barrier integrity, and T regulatory-mediated suppression, a major function attributed to both IL-10 and TGF&#x003b2; is the inhibition of proinflammatory cytokine production &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050041-b012">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050041-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;.

For example, CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> lamina propria cells from patients with Crohn's disease produced increased levels of IFN&#x003b3; and TNF&#x003b1; &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050041-b024">24</xref>&#x0005d;. Furthermore, neutralization of TNF&#x003b1; via administration of infliximab resulted in clinical benefits for IBD patients and a variety of other such biologic agents are in various stages of development and clinical testing &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050041-b048">48</xref>&#x0005d;. Studies in murine colitis models have also shown reduced pathology upon neutralization of IFN&#x003b3; or TNF&#x003b1; &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050041-b049">49</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050041-b052">52</xref>&#x0005d;. In dnKO mice, impairment or loss of both TGF&#x003b2;RII and IL-10R2 signaling resulted in intestinal pathology that was associated with dramatic increases in both T cell activation and IFN&#x003b3;, TNF&#x003b1;, and IL-6 levels. Depletion of IFN&#x003b3; and TNF&#x003b1; decreased the extent of pathology seen in 4-wk-old dnKO mice as compared to controls. While anti-IFN&#x003b3; treatment alone partially ameliorated disease, anti-TNF&#x003b1; treatment alone had little to no impact on intestinal pathology. Interestingly, significant reductions in epithelial hyperplasia were only detected when the two treatments were combined, suggesting that in the dnKO model these two cytokines have redundant roles in inducing hyperplasia. Our data therefore suggest that treatment regimens that effectively neutralize multiple proinflammatory cytokines could result in more successful clinical responses.</p><p>In recent years the role of IL-12 versus IL-23 in chronic inflammation has been reevaluated upon the realization that both cytokines share the IL-12p40 subunit &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050041-b053">53</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050041-b055">55</xref>&#x0005d;. In both human trials and murine models of colitis, neutralization of the IL-12p40 subunit resulted in decreased pathology &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050041-b056">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050041-b057">57</xref>&#x0005d;. Recently, a mutation in the IL-23R has been negatively linked with human IBD, suggesting that reduced signaling through this receptor protects against disease &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050041-b058">58</xref>&#x0005d;. Additionally, a study by Yen et al. has indicated a role for IL-23, rather than IL-12, in the induction of colitis due to its ability to promote IL-17 production &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050041-b059">59</xref>&#x0005d;. However, the proinflammatory effects of IL-23 are not necessarily restricted to its effects on IL-17 producing cells as IL-23 can increase proliferation and IFN&#x003b3; production by effector/memory T cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050041-b055">55</xref>&#x0005d; and has been demonstrated to also increase Th1 responses in colitis models &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050041-b060">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050041-b061">61</xref>&#x0005d;. Because IL-17 secretion was detected in the supernatants of colon explants (unpublished data) from dnKO mice, albeit at lower levels compared to IFN&#x003b3; and TNF&#x003b1; production, IL-17 and/or IL-23 may account for the residual pathology observed in dnKO mice after neutralization of both IFN&#x003b3; and TNF&#x003b1;. Regardless, results from our study and others would suggest that large perturbations in immune homeostasis through production of excessive Th1, Th17, or Th2 cytokines all have the ability to cause intestinal pathology.</p><p>Several overlapping lines of evidence, primarily from murine models, point to involvement of enteric bacteria in inducing IBD (reviewed in &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050041-b028">28</xref>&#x0005d;). For example, intestinal pathology in a number of models including IL-10<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice was diminished in germ-free settings &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050041-b062">62</xref>&#x0005d;. Similarly, colonic inflammation due to DSS-induced injury has been shown to be reduced in germ-free and antibiotic-treated mice &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050041-b022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050041-b063">63</xref>&#x0005d;. Experiments employing antibiotics to treat murine models of spontaneous colitis have demonstrated variable degrees of success depending on the animal model and the antibiotics used (e.g., &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050041-b064">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050041-b065">65</xref>&#x0005d;). We chose to employ two orally delivered antibiotics at high dosages: ciprofloxacin, which broadly targets aerobic bacteria, and metronidazole, which is active against anaerobic organisms. Antibiotic treatment resulted in complete inhibition of disease in dnKO mice as demonstrated by survival, weight gain equivalent to controls, absence of macroscopic and microscopic signs of colitis, and near-complete abrogation of proinflammatory cytokine production. These findings dramatically demonstrate that intestinal microbes are required for disease induction in this model of ulcerative colitis.</p><p>As discussed previously, current efforts at developing treatments for various forms of IBD, particularly ulcerative colitis, have focused extensively on devising costly new biologic agents, many of which act by specifically targeting cytokines including TNF&#x003b1; and IFN&#x003b3; &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050041-b048">48</xref>&#x0005d;. Our results demonstrate that neutralization of these cytokines, particularly in combination, also produced significant amelioration of colitis in dnKO mice. Although antibiotics, including ciprofloxacin and metronidazole, are sometimes used to treat patients with IBD, research regarding their efficacy remains inadequate. Current clinical consensus holds that they are useful in managing septic complications of IBD and certain aspects of Crohn's disease. However, their utility in ulcerative colitis has not been adequately assessed &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050041-b030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050041-b066">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050041-b067">67</xref>&#x0005d;, and recommendations vary regarding usage in patients with fulminant ulcerative colitis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050041-b048">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050041-b068">68</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0050041-b069">69</xref>&#x0005d;. We know of no large, blinded, controlled clinical studies examining combined metronidazole and ciprofloxacin treatment in ulcerative colitis. Our results suggest that carefully controlled studies examining the benefits of combined ciprofloxacin and metronidazole in ulcerative colitis may be appropriate.</p><p>Overall, our studies support the hypothesis that multiple genetic hits to immune regulation have the ability to produce the most severe forms of IBD. While impairment of either TGF&#x003b2;RII or IL-10R2 signaling alone was sufficient to cause some aspects of disease, the extent of pathology was significantly increased once these deficiencies were compounded. Our data demonstrate that the mechanism was at least in part due to uncontrolled T cell activation resulting in increased proinflammatory cytokine production. We further show that the inciting stimulus for this immune activation is microbial in origin. We propose that this model will be useful in the future to evaluate the mechanism of loss/attenuation of specific mucosal barrier components (e.g., goblet cells, surface enterocyte maturation, and epithelial stem cells) that also occurs in human ulcerative colitis, to evaluate combinatorial therapies directed against the numerous proinflammatory cytokines that are elicited by disregulated leukocytes, and to elucidate the mechanisms by which enteric microbes trigger disease.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed-0050041-sg001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><title>Intestinal Pathology in dnTGF&#x003b2;RII and IL-10R2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> Mice Develops More Slowly and Has a More Variable and Focal Pattern Than the Rapid, Diffuse Disease Seen in dnKO Mice</title><p>Ceca and colons from dnTGF&#x003b2;RII and IL-10R2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice were isolated at 3&#x02013;4 mo of age.
