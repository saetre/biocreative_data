In fact, expression of hPTTG correlates with cell proliferation in a cell cycle-dependent manner. Recently it was reported that PTTG is a vertebrate analog of the yeast securins Pds1 and Cut2, which are involved in sister chromatid separation.

Furthermore, DNA double-strand breaks prevent hPTTG&#x02013;Ku association and disrupt the hPTTG&#x02013;Ku complexes, indicating that genome damaging events, which result in the induction of pathways that activate DNA repair mechanisms and halt cell cycle progression, might inhibit hPTTG&#x02013;Ku interaction <italic>in vivo</italic>. We propose that hPTTG might connect DNA damage-response pathways with sister chromatid separation, delaying the onset of mitosis while DNA repair occurs.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The pituitary tumor-transforming gene (<italic>pttg</italic>) was first isolated from clonal rat GH<sub>4</sub> pituitary tumor cells by differential display (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke237c1">1</xref>), but no homology with known protein sequences or common functional motifs was found. However, overexpression of<italic> pttg</italic> in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts showed that it induces cell transformation <italic>in vitro</italic>, and injection of these transfected cells into athymic nude mice resulted in tumor formation in all animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke237c1">1</xref>). The <italic>pttg</italic>-transfected NIH 3T3 cells also stimulated expression and secretion of basic fibroblast growth factor, a human pituitary tumor growth-regulating factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke237c2">2</xref>). Nevertheless, we found that the human counterpart of PTTG, hPTTG (which was firstly isolated by us; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke237c3">3</xref>), is also expressed in other non-pituitary tumors. Samples from patients with leukemia, lymphoma or myelodysplastic diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke237c3">3</xref>), as well as adenocarcinomas of mammary and pulmonary origins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke237c4">4</xref>) showed strong <italic>hpttg</italic> expression. Our further studies demonstrate a correlation between <italic>hpttg </italic>expression and cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke237c5">5</xref>). The hPTTG protein level is up-regulated in rapidly proliferating cells, is down-regulated in response to serum starvation or cell confluence and is regulated in a cell cycle-dependent manner peaking in mitosis. In addition, hPTTG is phosphorylated by CDC2 during mitosis.</p><p> hPTTG is a protein of 202 residues partially localized in the nucleus that has a basic N-terminal portion and an acidic C-terminal portion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke237c3">3</xref>). It has several putative SH3-binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke237c3">3</xref>) and a conserved motif localized in the N-terminal portion matches the destruction box (D-box) shared by many anaphase-promoting complex or cyclosome (APC&#x0002f;C) substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke237c6">6</xref>). Recently, PTTG has been shown to be involved in sister chromatid separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke237c7">7</xref>). Precise coordination of multiple cell cycle events is required to ensure proper mitosis. Chromosome cohesion must be maintained until all chromosomes are attached to opposite poles of the mitotic spindle and aligned at the metaphase plate. At the onset of anaphase, the activity of separins contributes to the release of cohesins from chromosomes, allowing for the segregation of sister chromatids to opposite spindle poles. Separin activity is blocked by binding to a class of proteins known as securins, whose destruction at the metaphase-to-anaphase transition is triggered by the APC&#x0002f;C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke237c8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke237c12">12</xref>). PTTG has been identified as a vertebrate securin on the basis of its biochemical analogy to the Pds1 protein of budding yeast and the Cut2 protein of fission yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke237c7">7</xref>). The vertebrate securins share extensive sequence similarity with each other but show no sequence similarity to either of their yeast counterparts. Nevertheless, as was previously reported in yeast, expression of a stable <italic>Xenopus</italic> securin mutant protein blocks sister chromatid separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke237c7">7</xref>). hPTTG bound to a putative human separin homolog of yeast separins Esp1 and Cut1, and was degraded by proteolysis mediated by APC&#x0002f;C in a D-box-dependent manner. The finding that a vertebrate securin has tumorigenic activity is somewhat anticipated because chromosome missegregation has been predicted to be a major source of genetic instability, with profound consequences for cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke237c13">13</xref>). On the basis of its function, the simplest explanation is that tumor formation is the result of aneuploidy caused by defects in the sister chromatid separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke237c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke237c14">14</xref>).</p><p> To further understand the role of hPTTG in sister chromatid separation and tumorigenesis, we searched for proteins able to bind to hPTTG using the yeast two-hybrid approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke237c15">15</xref>). This<italic> in vivo</italic> strategy was employed to provide a physiological environment in which to detect potential interactions involving hPTTG, and in this paper we demonstrate that hPTTG physically associates with Ku-70.</p><p> The Ku-70 protein associates with Ku-80 to form a heterodimeric complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke237c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke237c17">17</xref>), and together with the &#x0223c;470 kDa catalytic subunit, DNA-PKcs, form the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke237c18">18</xref>). This enzyme is involved in repairing DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) caused, for example, by physiological oxidation reactions, V(D)J recombination, ionizing radiation and certain chemotherapeutic drugs. Ku heterodimer binds to DNA ends and other types of discontinuity in double-stranded DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke237c19">19</xref>). Ku itself is probably involved in stabilizing broken DNA ends, bringing them together and preparing them for ligation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke237c20">20</xref>). Ku also recruits DNA-PKcs to DNA DSBs, activating its kinase function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke237c21">21</xref>).</p><p> Our results demonstrate that hPTTG specifically interacts with Ku-70, which forms a complex with the Ku-70&#x0002f;Ku-80 heterodimer in intact cells, and that DNA-PKcs phosphorylates hPTTG <italic>in vitro</italic>. In addition, we show that hPTTG&#x02013;Ku-70 association is prevented by DNA DSBs. The implications of these results, as well as a model of the regulation of hPTTG&#x02013;Ku-70 interaction, are discussed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plasmids and cloning</title><p>Wild-type <italic>hpttg</italic> (coding for 202 residues) and the subclones <italic>hpttg-ES</italic> (residues 1&#x02013;188), <italic>hpttg-EA</italic> (residues 1&#x02013;163), <italic>hpttg-EXb</italic> (residues 1&#x02013;124) and <italic>hpttg-XbXh</italic> (residues 123&#x02013;202), were cloned inframe with <italic>gal4-DB</italic> (DNA-binding) in the yeast pGBT9 vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke237c22">22</xref>) to yield pGBT9-hPTTG, pGBT9-hPTTG-ES, pGBT9-hPTTG-EA, pGBT9-hPTTG-EXb and pGBT9-hPTTG-XbXh, respectively.

Full-length <italic>hpttg</italic> and <italic>hpttg-HXh</italic> were cloned in frame with a <italic>6His</italic>-tag in pRSET-A and purified from bacterial lysates by affinity chromatography on Talon resin. Lysates from HL-60 cells were incubated with the resin bound to 6His fusion proteins, the resin was washed and the eluted proteins resolved on gels and immunoblotted with an anti-Ku-70 monoclonal antibody. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke237f2">2</xref> clearly shows that the Ku-70 protein from cellular extracts interacts with 6His-hPTTG, whereas there is no interaction with 6His-hPTTG-HXh or with irrelevant fusion proteins (6His-S6, 6His-RII&#x003b1; or GST). Similar results were obtained with lysates from Jurkat, Cos and HeLa cells (data not shown). These results indicate that hPTTG and Ku-70 also interact <italic>in vitro</italic>. Furthermore, the finding that 6His-hPTTG-HXh, which lacks the 86 N-terminal residues of hPTTG, no longer interacted with Ku-70 suggests that the N-terminal portion of hPTTG is responsible for the association with Ku-70. In fact, the GST-hPTTG-EXb fusion protein, containing the N-terminal moiety of hPTTG, was able to interact with Ku-70 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke237f2">2</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>hPTTG and Ku-70 form a complex in intact cells</title><p><italic>hpttg</italic> is expressed in tissues that contain highly proliferating cells, and, in fact, we can establish a correlation between<italic> hpttg</italic> expression and cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke237c5">5</xref>). For this reason, we used the HL-60 cell line as an appropriate experimental model to study the <italic>in vivo</italic> protein complexes involving hPTTG. These cells respond to specific chemical stimuli by acquiring either a granulocyte- (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke237c37">37</xref>), monocyte- or macrophage-like phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke237c34">34</xref>). The acquisition of mature phenotypes can be demonstrated by a variety of differentiation markers and leads to growth arrest. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke237f3">3</xref>A, hPTTG protein is absent in HL-60 cells treated with PMA, which induces a macrophage-like differentiation. Therefore, we have a good model to examine the relevance of the hPTTG interactions.</p><p> To know whether hPTTG and Ku-70 formed complexes in intact cells, we performed a series of co-immunoprecipitation experiments. For this purpose, NP-40 lysates from HL-60 cells were incubated with anti-hPTTG polyclonal antibody or with the preimmune serum. The resulting immunocomplexes were blotted with anti-Ku-70 and, as illustrated in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke237f3">3</xref>B, hPTTG co-immunoprecipitated with the endogenous DNA-binding subunit of DNA-PK. Furthermore, Ku-80 was also detected after reblotting the dehybridized nitrocellulose filter with anti-Ku-80 specific monoclonal antibody (mAb 111) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke237f3">3</xref>B). Similarly, <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments with 6His-hPTTG showed that the binding of Ku-80 was detected in addition to the association of hPTTG with Ku-70. However, when anti-hPTTG antibody was previously incubated with 6His-hPTTG bound to resin, and the supernatant used to immunoprecipitate proteins from HL-60 extracts, Ku-70 and Ku-80 were no longer detected (data not shown). These results suggest that binding of hPTTG to Ku-70 does not modify the formation of the Ku-70&#x0002f;Ku-80 heterodimer.</p><p> Co-immunoprecipitations using lysates from PMA differentiated HL-60 cells were also performed as controls, and no Ku-70 was detected (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke237f3">3</xref>C). As indicated above, hPTTG protein was absent in these lysates, while Ku-70 was detected in both differentiated and undifferentiated HL-60 cells. Thus, our findings show that full-length hPTTG and Ku dimer can form a complex in intact cells.</p></sec><sec><title>hPTTG is a substrate for DNA-PKcs <italic>in vitro</italic></title><p>To determine whether the catalytic subunit of the DNA-PK complex phosphorylates hPTTG, we incubated soluble 6His-hPTTG with purified DNA-PKcs and Ku in the presence of sonicated DNA. The results show strong phosphorylation of 6His-hPTTG (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke237f4">4</xref>A, lane 1). The identification of at least six potential motifs for DNA-PK phosphorylation (Ser&#x0002f;Thr-Gln or Pro-Ser&#x0002f;Thr) in hPTTG might justify this phosphorylation level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke237c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke237c39">39</xref>). In fact, experiments performed with 6His-hPTTG-EA or 6His-hPTTG-HXh subclones, that only contain three potential phosphorylation sites, revealed lower phosphorylation signals (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke237f4">4</xref>A, lanes 3 and 5). No phosphorylation was observed in the absence of sonicated DNA or using the control protein 6His-&#x00394;GMAP as substrate for DNA-PK (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke237f4">4</xref>A, lanes 2, 4 and 6&#x02013;8).</p><p> The phosphorylation of hPTTG by DNA-PK was further studied by incubating the anti-Ku-70&#x0002f;Ku-80 heterodimer immunoprecipitates with 6His-hPTTG. As shown in Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke237f4">4</xref>B, the DNA-PKcs immunoprecipitated with anti-Ku-70&#x0002f;Ku-80 also phosphorylates hPTTG in the presence of sonicated DNA.</p><p> We next sought to know whether the binding hPTTG&#x0002f;Ku-70 was affected by DNA-PK phosphorylation. To this end, eluted 6His-hPTTG was phosphorylated <italic>in vitro</italic> by the DNA-PKcs co-immunoprecipitated with anti-Ku-70&#x0002f;Ku-80 heterodimer bound to protein A&#x02013;Sepharose beads. The supernatant fraction was obtained by sedimentation of the beads. Following washing of the beads with NET-NP-40 buffer, the beads and the supernatant fraction were boiled with SDS sample buffer. The adsorbates and the supernatants were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-hPTTG and both hPTTG and phosphorylated hPTTG were bound to Ku-70 complexes (data not shown). Therefore, in these experimental conditions, the hPTTG phosphorylation has no detectable effect on hPTTG&#x02013;Ku-70 association.</p></sec><sec><title>DNA DSBs prevent hPTTG&#x02013;Ku-70 association</title><p>Since DNA-PK is involved in DNA DSB repair and V(D)J recombination, we investigated whether the presence of DNA DSBs affects the interaction between hPTTG and Ku-70. NP-40 lysates were preincubated with sonicated salmon sperm DNA or with a linear plasmid (pUC18 digested with <italic>Eco</italic>RI) at the same concentration prior to incubation with 6His-hPTTG, and western-blot analyses with anti-Ku-70 showed that sonicated DNA largely decreased the hPTTG&#x02013;Ku-70 interaction and linear plasmid completely abolished this association (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke237f5">5</xref>A). Similar results were obtained when the yeast linear plasmid pGBT9 was used (data not shown). The observed differences between the sonicated DNA and the linear plasmids may be the result of the number of breaks on the total DNA. The sonicated salmon sperm DNA has a mean size of 7 kb, as visualized in agarose gels, while pUC18 has a size of 2.8 kb. In fact, when we used twice the amount of sonicated DNA, we abolished the hPTTG&#x02013;Ku-70 interaction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke237f5">5</xref>B). In contrast, incubation of NP-40 lysates with supercoiled DNA (pUC18 or pGBT9) did not affect the binding. Furthermore, incubation of sonicated salmon sperm DNA with hPTTG&#x02013;Ku-70 complexes bound to Talon resin largely disrupted the complexes once formed (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke237f5">5</xref>C). These data suggest that the presence of DNA breaks prevents hPTTG&#x02013;Ku-70 interaction and disrupts hPTTG&#x02013;Ku-70 complexes <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Mitosis is a complex process that includes nuclear envelope breakdown, chromatin condensation and chromosome segregation. Thus, multiple events must be coordinated in order to ensure the progression of mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke237c40">40</xref>). The onset of mitosis is controlled by the activity of the mitosis-promoting factor (MPF), which induces the formation of a mitotic spindle. After anaphase, the destruction of the mitotic cyclins leads to MPF inactivation, originating spindle disassembly and cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke237c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke237c42">42</xref>). The timing of the metaphase-to-anaphase transition and the exit from mitosis is regulated by the activation of the APC&#x0002f;C, which mediates selective proteolysis of various mitotic regulators. Pds1 from <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> and Cut2 from <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> (the securins) are APC&#x0002f;C sustrates and their degradation is required for chromatid separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke237c43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke237c44">44</xref>). Pds1 and Cut2 associate with Esp1 and Cut1 (the separins), respectively, and prevent separins from promoting chromatid separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke237c45">45</xref>). hPTTG has been identified as a human securin through its association with the human separin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke237c7">7</xref>). Recently, it has been proposed that in vertebrates, a cleavage-independent pathway removes cohesin from chromosome arms during prophase, whereas a separin-dependent pathway cleaves centromeric cohesin at the metaphase-to-anaphase transition. In a HeLa cell line stably expressing a tagged version of Scc1 cohesin, it has been shown that Scc1 is cleaved and removed from centromeric regions at the metaphase-to-anaphase transition. Scc1 cleavage depends on the APC&#x0002f;C because securin proteolysis is needed for separin activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke237c46">46</xref>).</p><p> Through a two-hybrid screen in yeast using hPTTG as bait, we isolated a protein of 70 kDa that specifically interacts with hPTTG. This protein is Ku-70, the DNA-binding component of the DNA-dependent protein kinase. DNA-PK is a DNA-activated nuclear serine&#x0002f;threonine protein kinase that consists of a regulatory subunit, the heterodimeric Ku protein (composed of a 70 and 80 kDa subunit), which binds DNA ends and targets the catalytic subunit, DNA-PKcs, to DNA strand breaks. All three gene products are clearly involved in repairing ionizing radiation-induced damage and in V(D)J recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke237c47">47</xref>). The Ku-dependent repair process, called illegitimate recombination or non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), appears to be the main DNA DSB repair mechanism in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke237c48">48</xref>). hPTTG interacts both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> with Ku heterodimer and is a substrate for DNA-PKcs. In budding yeast, DNA damage induces the phosphorylation of the PTTG homolog Pds1, and this phosphorylation is specific for types of DNA damage that elicit a mitotic checkpoint arrest but not of reagents that cause a DNA replication checkpoint arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke237c49">49</xref>). The equivalent checkpoint in fission yeast and vertebrates arrests the cell cycle at the G<sub>2</sub>&#x02013;M boundary and, although the arrest point differs, the signal transduction pathway involves damage-dependent phosphorylation that is mediated by a conserved element (i.e. Mec1 in budding yeast, Rad3 in fission yeast and probably ATM in mammalian cells) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke237c50">50</xref>). We suggest that in human cells DNA damage inducing G<sub>2</sub> arrest not only leads to inhibitory phosphorylation of the kinase CDC2 via an ATM-dependent pathway, but also induces DNA-PK phosphorylation of PTTG.</p><p> Our findings that hPTTG forms a complex with Ku-70 and that this interaction is regulated by DNA DSBs allow us to propose a mechanism of regulation of hPTTG&#x02013;Ku interaction. Ku dimer interacts with the N-terminal portion of hPTTG (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke237f2">2</xref>). The C-terminal portion of hPTTG would associate with the N-terminal part of human separin, if the human system is similar to the fission yeast system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke237c51">51</xref>). Moreover, we think this is also true in metazoans, because although Pds1, Cut2 and PTTG show no sequence similarity to each other, the C-terminus of the putative human separin homolog (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke237c52">52</xref>) has 28&#x00025; identity with Esp1 and 30&#x00025; identity with Cut1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke237c53">53</xref>), and the N-terminus has no similarity. One might presume that this non-homologous region of each separin interacts with the respective securin and the similar C-terminal portions of separins would bind to homolog partners or at least to different partners with similar protein-binding motif. In response to DNA damage, Ku enhances both the strength and stability of the association with DNA and DNA-PKcs becomes activated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke237c54">54</xref>), then hPTTG dissociates from Ku-70 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke237f5">5</xref>) and is phosphorylated by DNA-PK (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke237f4">4</xref>). The phosphorylated form of hPTTG would contribute to block sister chromatid separation.</p><p> A recent publication states that telomeric DNA mutants of <italic>Tetrahymena thermophila</italic> block sister chromatid separation in mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke237c55">55</xref>). On the other hand, it is also known that Ku plays a role in maintaining chromosomal stability protecting the telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke237c56">56</xref>): yeast strains defective in Ku-70 or Ku-80 lose the majority, but not all, of their terminal telomere repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke237c57">57</xref>). Thus, through their contribution to efficient telomeric end-capping, NHEJ repair proteins help to preserve the fidelity of genetic inheritance. Therefore, we might suggest that this protective role of Ku could be mediated at least in part by the inhibition of sister chromatid separation. Further experiments will be necessary to investigate this hypothesis.</p><p> Stable transfection of NIH 3T3 cells with <italic>pttg</italic> cDNA causes anchorage-independent transformation <italic>in vitro</italic> and induces <italic>in vivo</italic> tumor formation when transfectants are injected into athymic mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke237c1">1</xref>). This suggests that misregulation of chromatid separation may contribute to generation of malignant tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke237c7">7</xref>). In this way, inactivation of the <italic>ku-70</italic> gene also leads to a propensity for malignant transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke237c58">58</xref>). <italic>ku-70</italic><italic><sup>&#x02013;&#x0002f;&#x02013;</sup></italic> mice develop T cell lymphomas and karyotyping analyses on cultured cells derived from primary T cell lymphomas reveal multiple chromosomal abnormalities (monosomies, trisomies, duplications, etc.). This might be explained<italic> in vivo</italic>, at least in part, in terms of an increased rate of sister chromatid exchange, but we cannot eliminate the possibility that defects in sister chromatid separation also play a role. Therefore, both defective regulation of hPTTG and inactivation of the <italic>ku-70</italic> gene facilitate neoplastic growth.</p><p> To summarize, our studies show that the human securin&#x0002f;hPTTG is associated with the DNA-dependent protein kinase both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> and that it is phosphorylated by DNA-PKcs. Our data also demonstrate that DNA DSBs prevent hPTTG&#x02013;Ku-70 association. Together, these observations suggest that hPTTG might connect the DNA damage&#x02013;response pathway with sister chromatid separation.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gke237f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Interaction of Ku-70 with hPTTG using the two-hybrid system.
