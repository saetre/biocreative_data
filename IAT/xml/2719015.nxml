More recently, C/EBP&#x003b1; was also reported to induce the expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 gene in hematopoietic cell lines in a manner independent of its DNA binding activity and protects Ba/F3 (a widely studied immature murine hematopoietic cell line with a pro-B lymphoid phenotype) from apoptosis on interleukin-3 withdrawal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006552-PazPriel1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. In this work, we investigate whether C/EBP&#x003b1; expression is modulated during apoptosis and whether C/EBP&#x003b1; contributes to apoptosis development in a common sense. Our observations indicate that the activation of protein kinase Cdelta (PKC&#x003b4;) upon apoptosis results in the increased proteasome-dependent degradation of C/EBP&#x003b1;, which partially contributes to PKC&#x003b4;-mediated apoptosis.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>C/EBP&#x003b1; protein is significantly reduced upon apoptosis induction in leukemic cells</title><p>To evaluate whether the C/EBP&#x003b1; protein is regulated during apoptosis induction, NSC606985 (a water-soluble camptothecin ester derivative <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006552-Rapisarda1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006552-Liu1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>) was used as an apoptosis-inducing agent. Consistent with our previous report <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006552-Song1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, the proteolytic activation of caspase-3 (a critical apoptosis effector <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006552-Porter1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>), as assessed by decreased pro-caspase-3 and increased active fragments of caspase-3, was induced by 25 nM of NSC606985 treatment for 12 hours in acute promyelocytic leukemic (APL) NB4 cells or by 50 nM of NSC606985 treatment for 36 hours in acute monocytic leukemic U937 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006552-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Concomitantly, the treatment also triggered these two cell lines to undergo apoptosis, in which NB4 cells were more sensitive than U937 cells, as estimated by percentages of annexin-V<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells and sub-G<sub>1</sub> cells on flow cytometry as well as the Wright's staining-based morphological examinations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006552.s002">Figure S1</xref>). When the activated caspase-3 was detected, more intriguingly, C/EBP&#x003b1; protein was significantly reduced to an undetectable level in NSC606985-treated NB4 and U937 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006552-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Of note, only the p42 isoform of C/EBP&#x003b1; could be clearly detected in NB4 and U937 cells, although there are two C/EBP&#x003b1; isoforms (p42 and p30) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006552-Ramji1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, C/EBP&#x003b1; protein is its p42 isoform in the following experiments. Additionally, 50 nM of NSC606985 also effectively reduced C/EBP&#x003b1; protein together with the cleaved activation of PKC&#x003b4; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006552-g001">Figure 1B</xref>) and apoptosis induction (data not shown) in primary leukemic cells from bone marrow (BM) of two AML patients. To determine whether the reduced C/EBP&#x003b1; protein is NSC606985-specific or apoptosis-dependent, other apoptosis inducers including etoposide, doxorubicin, arsenic trioxide (As<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) and ultraviolent (UV) radiation were applied to NB4 and U937 cells. All these insults could effectively induce apoptosis of these two cell lines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006552.s003">Figure S2</xref>/<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006552.s004">S3</xref>) together with proteolytic activation of caspase-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006552-g001">Figure 1C/D</xref>). Meanwhile, C/EBP&#x003b1; protein was also reduced in NB4 and U937 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006552-g001">Figure 1C/D</xref>). Notably, C/EBP&#x003b2; and p53 proteins were undetectable in NB4 and U937 cells, respectively, and both NSC606985 and etoposide failed to alter the expression of C/EBP&#x003b2; protein in U937 cells or p53 protein in NB4 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006552-g001">Figure 1A/C</xref>). All these data supported that the reduction of C/EBP&#x003b1; protein is common to apoptosis induction.</p><fig id="pone-0006552-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0006552.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>C/EBP&#x003b1; protein is significantly reduced upon the onset of apoptosis in leukemic cells.</title><p>NB4 and U937 cells were treated respectively with 25 nM and 50 nM of NSC606985 (A) or 0.5 &#x000b5;M and 1 &#x000b5;M etoposide (C).

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006552-g002">Figure 2A</xref>, half-life of C/EBP&#x003b1; protein in NB4 cells was more than 8 hours. In NSC606985 or etoposide-treated cells, however, C/EBP&#x003b1; protein disappeared or decreased to less than 50&#x00025; at 4 hours after CHX blockage of protein synthesis, indicating that the stabilization of the C/EBP&#x003b1; protein was also lowered upon apoptosis induction. Evan so, we continued to dynamically measure the mRNA level of CEBPA in NSC606985- or etoposide-treated NB4 and U937 cells by real-time quantitative RT-PCR. The results revealed that NSC606985/etoposide-treated NB4 cells also presented reduced CEBPA mRNA, which initially appeared at 6 hours and 24 hours after treatment of NSC606985 and etoposide respectively, and became more significant later (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006552-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). The reduced CEBPA mRNA could also be seen in NSC606985/etoposide-treated U937 cells, but CEBPA mRNA also experienced a rapid but temporary increase before the down-regulation in U937 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006552-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). This was also true for C/EBP&#x003b1; protein in U937 but not in NB4 cells treated by both NSC606985 and etoposide, although statistic significance was absent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006552-g001">Figure 1A/B</xref>). Furthermore, a CEBPA promoter-driven luciferase reporter assay also supported NSC606985 and etoposide significantly inhibited CEBPA gene promoter-driven luciferase transcription in both NB4 and U937 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006552-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). It should be point out that although the transitory elevation of CEBPA gene promoter-driven transcription could also be tested in U937 cells under the treatment of NSC606985 or etoposide, the early elevation of the reporter gene is very weak which indicated that there may be other mechanisms involved in the transient elevation of CEBPA mRNA. All these results proposed that both reduced transcription and increased degradation contributed to the down-regulation of C/EBP&#x003b1; expression during apoptosis induction.</p><fig id="pone-0006552-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0006552.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>The decrease of C/EBP&#x003b1; protein during apoptosis involves induction of protein degradation and inhibition of transcription.</title><p>(A) After pretreatment with 25 nM of NSC606985 or 0.5 &#x000b5;M of etoposide for 12 hours, NB4 cells were incubated with 10 &#x000b5;g/ml CHX for indicated hours.

What this band actually corresponds to remained to be explored. Also, it should be pointed out that the increase of truncated PKC&#x003b4; had a good correlation with the decrease of full-length PKC&#x003b4; after 24 hours of NSC606985 treatment in NB4 cells, but such correlation was not so remarkable in NSC606985 or etoposide-treated U937 cells.

As a result, a total of 33 proteins were found to be dysregulated in this situation and we proposed that the downregulation of N-myc downstream regulated gene 1 (NDRG1) is involved in proteolytic activation of PKC&#x003b4; during apoptosis induction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006552-Zheng1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Next, we investigated whether the down-regulation of C/EBP&#x003b1; protein is mediated by proteolytically activated PKC&#x003b4;. Our results showed that inhibition of action of PKC&#x003b4; by rottlerin and stable transfection of DN-PKC&#x003b4; partially rescured C/EBP&#x003b1; protein but not its mRNA level upon NSC606985 treatment, suggesting that the activated PKC&#x003b4; protein contributes to the increased degradation of C/EBP&#x003b1; protein but not to the reduced transcription of CEBPA by DNA-damaging agents. This notion is also supported by the fact that transfected expression of the PKC&#x003b4;-CF reduces C/EBP&#x003b1; protein but not its mRNA.</p><p>In accordance with previous reports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006552-Song1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006552-Cross1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006552-Leverrier1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>, overexpression of the PKC&#x003b4;-CF is sufficient to induce apoptosis, and proteolytic activation of PKC&#x003b4; exerts a critical role in NSC606985-induced apoptosis at least in AML cells. However, mechanisms of PKC&#x003b4;-mediated apoptosis are controversial. PKC&#x003b4; is a mobile enzyme, and its intracellular distribution is altered upon activation. This is one way to reach the appropriate targets in order to elicit its biological responses. One of the most important questions is how and where PKC&#x003b4; transduces its apoptotic signals. It appears that PKC&#x003b4; can act at several locations for apoptosis induction, including the plasma membrane, mitochondria and nucleus. Previously, we showed that NSC606985-induced PKC&#x003b4; cleavage simultaneously occurs in the cytoplasm and nuclei of both NB4 and U937 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006552-Song1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. In spite of the subcellular localization, it remains to be illustrated what are the downstream targets of PKC&#x003b4; for apoptosis induction. In response to DNA damage, as reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006552-Bharti1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>, catalytic fragment of PKC&#x003b4; can phosphorylate and inactivate DNA-dependent protein kinase, resulting in further cell death. PKC&#x003b4; can also phosphorylate p73&#x003b2;, a member of the p53 family <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006552-Ren1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>. Lamin B and phospholipid scramblase 3 were also proposed to be substrates of PKC&#x003b4; and could contribute to apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006552-Liu2">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006552-Park1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, PKC&#x003b4; can contribute to apoptosis by phosphorylating different targets that are localized in the nucleus, plasma membrane or mitochondria. However, our immunoprecipitation experiment did not support the C/EBP&#x003b1;-PKC&#x003b4; interaction and the activated PKC&#x003b4; did not appear to directly induce phosphorylation of C/EBP&#x003b1; protein (data not shown). On the other hand, the NSC606985-induced decrease of C/EBP&#x003b1; protein was significantly antagonized by specific proteasome inhibitors MG-132, epoxomicin and bortezomib. Of great importance, NSC606985 and ectopic expression of PKC&#x003b4;-CF significantly increased ubiquitination of endogenously and ectopically expressed C/EBP&#x003b1; protein, while rottlerin significantly inhibited the enhanced ubiquitination of endogenously expressed C/EBP&#x003b1; protein during NSC606985 treatment. Although the effect of the forced expression of DN-PKC&#x003b4; on ubiquitination of C/EBP&#x003b1; protein remains to be determined, all these results suggested that activated PKC&#x003b4; mediates proteasome-dependent degradation of C/EBP&#x003b1; protein, which is involved the enhanced degradation of C/EBP&#x003b1; protein upon apoptosis induction. In fact, a recent report showed that the von Hippel-Lindau tumor-suppressor protein, a ubiquitin-ligase (E3) directing proteasome-dependent degradation of targeted proteins, interacts directly with the catalytic domain of PKC&#x003b4; in cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006552-Iturrioz1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>, and PKC&#x003b4; does mediate proteasome-dependent degradation of certain proteins such as mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase-1 and p21<sup>cip1</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006552-Walker1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006552-Choi1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>. By the way, we also found that activated PKC&#x003b4; could alter the subcellular localization of C/EBP&#x003b1; protein (data not shown), which might be related to the degradation of C/EBP&#x003b1; protein.</p><p>It remains to be investigated how CEBPA mRNA was reduced during apoptosis induction. The actinomycin-inhibiting test showed that NSC606985 or etoposide treatment failed to alter the stability of CEBPA mRNA (data not shown), suggesting that the transcription of CEBPA may be regulated, which could be supported by the CEBPA promoter driven luciferase reporter assay. As reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006552-Tang1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006552-Legraverend1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>, the consensus recognition sequences of some apoptosis-related transcription factors such as sp1, myc/max and AP2&#x003b1; are present in the promoter region of CEBPA gene. Therefore, the down-regulation of CEBPA during apoptosis induction may also be associated with these factors. Additionally, the auto-activation function of C/EBP&#x003b1; protein has been reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006552-Kockar1">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, we cannot exclude the possibility that the decrease of CEBPA mRNA is due to the reduced C/EBP&#x003b1; protein although the decrease of C/EBP&#x003b1; protein but not its mRNA was partially rescued by rottlerin and the expression of PKC&#x003b4;-CF also reduced C/EBP&#x003b1; protein but not its mRNA.</p><p>The inhibition of caspase-3 by its specific inhibitor did not completely inhibit PKC&#x003b4; activation-related apoptosis, suggesting that caspase-3-independent mechanism(s) also contributes to the event <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006552-Song1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006552-Basu1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006552-Cross1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006552-Hamada1">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref>. The fact that C/EBP&#x003b1; protein was one of the down-stream effectors of the activated PKC&#x003b4; during apoptosis induction pushed us to explore its possible role in apoptotic event. Here we showed that inhibition of C/EBP&#x003b1; expression enhanced, while its over-expression inhibited, DNA-damaging agents-induced apoptosis, which could be shown by annexin-V<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells&#x00025;, especially by sub-G<sub>1</sub> cells&#x00025; and apoptosis-related morphologic analysis. These results demonstrated that the modulation of C/EBP&#x003b1; expression contributes, at least partially, to the activation of PKC&#x003b4;-mediated apoptosis. It was proposed that C/EBP&#x003b1; induces the expression of the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006552-PazPriel1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. However, this notion could not be confirmed in this work. Similarly, conditional expression of C/EBP&#x003b1; protein did not alter other apoptosis-related genes, including Bak, Bax and Mcl-1. Therefore, molecular mechanisms of anti-apoptotic effect of C/EBP&#x003b1; remain to be explored.</p><p>Taken together, our results demonstrated that C/EBP&#x003b1; expression is down-regulated in apoptotic leukemic cells partially through induction of protein degradation, the latter involving proteolytically activated PKC&#x003b4;-enhanced ubiquitination of C/EBP&#x003b1; protein. Furthermore, C/EBP&#x003b1; exerts a role in chemotherapeutic drugs-induced apoptosis. These results would shed novel sights for understanding mechanisms of PKC&#x003b4;-related apoptosis and functions of C/EBP&#x003b1; between differentiation and apoptosis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cell treatment and apoptosis assay</title><p>Leukemic cell lines, including NB4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006552-Lanotte1">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref> and U937, were grown in RPMI-1640 medium (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO) supplemented with 10&#x00025; heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco BRL, Gaithersburg, ML) in 5&#x00025; CO<sub>2</sub>/95&#x00025; air humidified atmosphere at 37&#x000b0;C.
