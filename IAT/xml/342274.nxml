The tRNA was digested completely with RNases T1 and A in the presence of alkaline phosphatase, the oligonucleotides were 3'-terminally (3H)-labeled, mapped on PEI-cellulose thin layers, isolated, and sequenced by methods based on base-specific cleavages. Overlaps were obtained by readout sequencing techniques on polyacrylamide gels and PEI-cellulose thin layers. The thin-layer readout technique was used also to locate and identify modified nucleotides. The primary structure was found to exhibit a large degree of homology (94.6%) with silkworm tRNAGCCGly but only 67.6% homology with human tRNACCCGly.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00457-0144-a" xlink:role="964"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00457-0146-a" xlink:role="966"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00457-0139.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="959"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00457-0140.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="960"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00457-0141.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="961"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00457-0142.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="962"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00457-0143.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="963"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00457-0144.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="964"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00457-0145.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="965"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00457-0146.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="966"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00457-0147.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="967"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00457-0148.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="968"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00457-0149.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="969"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00457-0150.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="970"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
