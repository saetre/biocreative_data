At the molecular level, muscle aging is known to alter the expression of a variety of genes but very little is known about the molecular effectors involved. SRF (Serum Response Factor) is a crucial transcription factor for muscle-specific gene expression and for post-natal skeletal muscle growth. To assess its role in adult skeletal muscle physiology, we developed a post-mitotic myofiber-specific and tamoxifen-inducible SRF knockout model. Five months after SRF loss, no obvious muscle phenotype was observed suggesting that SRF is not crucial for myofiber maintenance. However, mutant mice progressively developed IIB myofiber-specific atrophy accompanied by a metabolic switch towards a more oxidative phenotype, muscular lipid accumulation, sarcomere disorganization and fibrosis. After injury, mutant muscles exhibited an altered regeneration process, showing smaller regenerated fibers and persistent fibrosis. All of these features are strongly reminiscent of abnormalities encountered in aging skeletal muscle. Interestingly, we also observed an important age associated decrease in SRF expression in mice and human muscles. Altogether, these results suggest that a naturally occurring SRF down-regulation precedes and contributes to the muscle aging process. Indeed, triggering SRF loss in the muscles of mutant mice results in an accelerated aging process.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Skeletal muscle accounts for about 40&#x00025; of the mass of the adult human body and is essential for maintaining and moving the skeleton, for breathing and for thermoregulation. Skeletal muscle is also one of the most metabolically active tissues in the body. The effects of aging on skeletal muscle include gradual loss of muscle mass, decline in muscle quality and functional properties. The decline in muscle quality is characterized by the presence of intramuscular fat, tissue fibrosis and a decreased regenerative potential. These age-related modifications in skeletal muscle, which have also been called sarcopenia, can be particularly severe and can affect both quality of life and lifespan of patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003910-Pahor1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. In order to counteract these modifications both in muscle structure and function, it is essential to understand the mechanisms involved in the maintenance of muscle mass and quality.</p><p>The regulation of muscle mass depends on a fine balance between protein synthesis and protein degradation which are controlled by different growth factors and signalling pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003910-Schiaffino1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. For instance, activation of PI3Kinase/Akt/mTOR signalling downstream of IGF-1 increases protein content whereas activation of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathways through Atrogin1 and Murf1 stimulates protein degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003910-Glass1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Whilst the mechanisms involved in skeletal muscle homeostasis have been rather well described, those involved in the age-related decline in muscle quality have not yet been fully elucidated. Age-related wasting and decreased regeneration potential of muscles have been associated to the decline in satellite cell function with age rather than to their number. Components of the micro-environment, or &#x0201c;niche&#x0201d;, which supports satellite cell activation, may vary with age. These components include: molecular signals expressed or secreted by the myofiber, basal lamina structure, products secreted by local interstitial cells (such as connective tissue, micro-vasculature, neural and immune system cellular components) and systemic factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003910-Gopinath1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Indeed, recent data has demonstrated the importance of endocrine/paracrine factors and Wnt pathways in age-related changes in muscle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003910-Brack1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref> as well as in more general aging processes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003910-Yamamoto1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>At the molecular level, muscle aging is known to alter the expression of a variety of genes within the myofibers but very little is known about their molecular effectors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003910-Dennis1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003910-Giresi1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Our recent findings have emphasized the role played by Serum Response Factor (SRF) in controlling post-natal muscle growth and transcription of locally expressed growth factors that are important for satellite cell accretion to growing myofibers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003910-Charvet1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. SRF is a member of the MADS family of transcription factors that is produced in particularly large amounts in all muscles. <italic>Via</italic> binding to CArG box regulatory elements, SRF controls several extracellular stimuli-regulated genes important for cell growth, survival and migration, as well as muscle-specific genes. Moreover, several recent data -including ours- have demonstrated that SRF plays a key role in regulating the expression of many genes encoding muscle cytoskeletal and sarcomeric proteins including those for actins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003910-Charvet1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003910-Miano1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. SRF driven transcription of specific gene promoters can be regulated by different mechanisms, including modulating the level of SRF expression, SRF phosphorylation, nature and number of CArG boxes in the target gene, RhoA-mediated alterations in the cytoskeleton and association of SRF with different context or cell-specific co-factors. Several data suggest that SRF could be important when muscle mechanical loading is perturbed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003910-Fluck1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003910-Gordon1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. For example SRF transcriptional activity is up-regulated by biomechanical stimuli <italic>via</italic> pathways involving integrin signalling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003910-Carson1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. SRF could thus play a central role in modulating gene expression to adapt muscle contractility to physiological demands.</p><p>In order to investigate SRF function in skeletal muscle growth and physiology, we created a model of targeted invalidation of SRF using the Cre-LoxP system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003910-Charvet1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. However, the early and progressive evolution of the muscle phenotype, the fragility and the high degree of lethality of these mutant mice made it difficult to investigate the function of SRF in fully mature muscle physiology. By crossing mice homozygous for <italic>SRF</italic> floxed alleles (<italic>S<sup>f</sup>/S<sup>f</sup></italic>) with <italic>HSA-Cre-ER<sup>T2</sup></italic> transgenic mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003910-Schuler1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref> that express a tamoxifen (TAM) dependent Cre recombinase, exclusively in post-mitotic myofibers, we obtained a mouse model in which it is now possible to trigger at will the onset of SRF ablation in skeletal myofibers.</p><p>Here we show that mutant mice in which SRF is selectively ablated in adult post-mitotic myofibers develop a broad spectrum of alterations similar to those which have been described in age-advanced skeletal muscles. Thus, the age-related decrease in SRF that we observed in both mice and human muscles might contribute to muscle aging.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Generation of Mutant Mice</title><p>Mice homozygous for <italic>SRF</italic> floxed alleles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003910-Parlakian1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref> (abbreviated to <italic>S<sup>f</sup>/S<sup>f</sup></italic>) and <italic>HSA-Cre-ER<sup>T2</sup></italic> transgenic mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003910-Schuler1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref> have been described elsewhere.

The body temperature was maintained at about 37&#x000b0;C by means of heating lamps. The nerves innervating the muscles (proximally crushed) were stimulated with a bipolar silver electrode using a supramaximal square wave pulse of 0.1 ms duration. Measurements were made at L0 (length at which maximal tension was obtained during the twitch). Maximal tetanic force (P0; stimulation frequency of 75&#x02013;143 Hz) was recorded and analysed on a personal microcomputer, using PowerLab system and Chart 4 software (ADInstruments, Paris, France). Once the contractile measurements had been made, the animals were killed with an overdose of pentobarbital.

As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003910-g002">Fig 2B</xref>, no difference was observed in myofiber CSA distribution between controls and mutants 5 months after TAM injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003910-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). In contrast, 13 months after TAM injection, the fiber size distribution was altered in mutants, with the vast majority of the mutant muscle fibers having a CSA between 500 and 1000 &#x000b5;m2, whereas the mean myofibers CSA for control muscle fibers was between 1500 and 2000 &#x000b5;m2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003910-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>). The CSA of the muscle fibers depends on their contractile and energy metabolism status. In the plantaris muscle which is mainly composed of fibers that express MyHC-IIA and -IIB (80&#x00025;), fast/oxidative type IIA fibers have a smaller CSA than fast/glycolytic IIB fibers. Therefore, we investigated whether the distribution of oxidative/glycolytic myofiber subtypes was modified in mutant muscles, using antibodies specific to MyHC-IIA and -IIB isoforms. No significant differences were observed 5 months after TAM injection (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0003910-t001">table 1</xref>). In contrast, 13 months after TAM injection, immunostaining showed that the mutant Plantaris muscle contained fewer MyHC-IIB myofibers (38&#x00025; versus 54&#x00025; in control) and more MyHC-IIA myofibers (43&#x00025; versus 27&#x00025; in control) as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003910-g002">Fig. 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0003910-t001">Table 1</xref>. SDH staining was performed in order to assess whether the MyHC fiber type modification was accompanied by a metabolic switch from glycolytic to oxidative metabolism. In agreement with MyHC typing data, we observed an increase in the number of myofibers with high SDH staining in muscles lacking SRF since 13 months (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003910-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0003910-t001">Table 1</xref>). Moreover, measurement of the mean CSA of the various myofiber subtypes revealed a specific atrophy of MyHC-IIB fibers in mutant muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003910-g002">Fig. 2E</xref>). Hence, both a specific MyHC-IIB fiber atrophy and a switch towards a more oxidative phenotype seemed to account for the atrophy observed in mutant muscles. This phenotype is strongly reminiscent of what is observed in aged muscles, with IIB myofibers being more prone to age related muscle atrophy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003910-Lexell1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. Another classical sign of skeletal muscle aging is an increase in tissue fibrosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003910-Brack1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. We therefore investigated the presence of fibrosis by Sirius red staining in 15 months old control and mutant mice. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003910-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>, mutant muscles exhibited endomysial fibrosis, whereas such an accumulation of fibrotic tissue has never been observed in control muscles at the same age.</p><fig id="pone-0003910-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0003910.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Progressive atrophy of MyHC-IIB fibers and metabolic switch in SRF deficient muscles.</title><p>(A) Quantitative real-time PCR was performed on RNAs prepared from gastrocnemius muscles of control (white) and mutant (black) mice 5 months (5 m.) and 13 months (13 m.) after TAM injection (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;4).

We investigated a possible alteration in the lipid content of mutant muscles in comparison to aged-matched control muscles by using Oil Red O staining that highlights the accumulation of neutral lipids. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003910-g003">Figure 3B</xref>, Oil Red-O positive droplets were abundant in 15 months old mutant muscles, whereas only a weak staining was observed in age-matched control muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003910-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). Muscles lacking SRF accumulated both extracellular and intramyocellular lipids.

To determine whether intramyocelullar lipid accumulation resulted from lipogenesis in mutant muscle, we measured the protein levels of two actors of lipogenesis, the Sterol Regulatory Element Binding Protein-1c (SREBP-1c), a key lipogenic transcription factor that has been shown to regulate the transcription of genes involved in fatty acid metabolism, and <italic>Fatty Acid Synthase</italic> (<italic>FAS</italic>), one of the SREBP-1c targets. At the molecular level, lipid accumulation was shown 8 months after TAM injection (10 months old mice) in mutant muscles to be correlated with an up-regulation of the transcriptionnally active form of SREBP-1c protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003910-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>). This was correlated with an up-regulation of FAS in the mutant muscles, whereas no increase was observed in TAM-injected age-matched controls. The increase in SREBP-1c expression was not accompanied with an up-regulation of <italic>SREBP-1c</italic> mRNA, thus excluding a direct transcriptional control by SRF (data not shown). These results suggest that lipogenesis is activated in mutant muscles and can already be detected 8 months after TAM injection, which is not the case in age-matched control muscles.</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>Altered Sarcomere Ultrastructure in Mutant Muscles</title><p>Since <italic>skeletal</italic> and <italic>cardiac &#x003b1;-actin</italic> transcription was found to be profoundly decreased in mutant muscles, we investigated the consequences of SRF loss on muscle structure.

Muscle regeneration involves satellite cell activation and recruitment for fusion with damaged myofibers or for the production of new muscle fibers. As satellite cells of mutant muscles do not express the <italic>Cre-ER<sup>T2</sup></italic> recombinase, control and mutant mice were injected every three days with TAM during the regeneration process to avoid possible re-expression of SRF in myofibers after satellite cell recruitment. Before regeneration, analysis of H&#x00026;E-stained sections demonstrated no visible differences between the two types of mice regarding the histology of TA muscle (data not shown). Twenty-one days after injury, while a complete regeneration was observed in control muscles, characterized by centrally located, nuclei mutant muscles displayed increased interstitial spaces and smaller regenerated myofibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003910-g005">Fig. 5A and B</xref>). Such altered regeneration was confirmed by comparing the regenerated myofiber CSA at day 21 post-injury. As presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003910-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>, the size distribution of regenerated myofibers CSA of mutants is decreased as compared with regenerated control myofibers.

These results prompted us to analyse the expression of SRF in skeletal muscles isolated from control mice at various ages. A progressive and important decrease in SRF protein expression, up to a 70&#x00025; down-regulation at 15 months of age, could be observed in skeletal muscle with age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003910-g006">Figure 6A</xref>).

The ability to inactivate SRF at a specific and controlled time point may help us to understand its different specific functions. TAM-dependent activation of the <italic>Cre-ER<sup>T2</sup></italic> led to an efficient, but not complete deletion of the <italic>SRF</italic> gene in skeletal muscle fibers, as revealed by the presence of a small proportion of immunostained nuclei for SRF in mutant myofibers. This was confirmed by the fact that, about 20&#x00025; of <italic>SRF</italic> transcripts were detected by quantitative RT-PCR in TAM-injected mutants whereas, using the same approach, very few <italic>SRF</italic> transcripts could be detected in our previous constitutive muscle-specific SRF KO model in which the Cre was driven by the same human <italic>skeletal &#x003b1;-actin</italic> promoter (data not shown) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003910-Charvet1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. Such residual amounts of SRF might be sufficient to activate a certain sub-set of SRF-dependent genes but not others. This could explain why the transcription of the <italic>skeletal &#x003b1;-actin</italic> gene that contains 4 CArG boxes and is a major SRF target <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003910-Muscat1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref> is down-regulated by 60&#x00025;, whereas the transcription of the IGF-1 gene with one active CArG box <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003910-Charvet1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref> was not affected in this model (data not shown). Another possibility is that SRF is needed for <italic>IGF-1</italic> transcription in the context of the growing myofiber, but not in the adult. A number of studies have shown that there is an age-related decline in the level of muscle IGF-1 during sarcopenia.

Accordingly, in our model, we can exclude the implication of a loss of <italic>IGF-1</italic> expression within the myofibers in the accelerated aging process that is observed. Our data demonstrate that this inducible model of SRF ablation mimics what occurs naturally and progressively during normal mouse muscle aging. Moreover, we show that once an 80&#x00025; SRF loss has been induced in 2 months old mice, the installation of the phenotype is very progressive. The phenotype begins to be observed at 8 months after TAM injection (lipid accumulation, tubular aggregates) but all of the alterations, associated with premature aging, can only be clearly observed at 13 months after TAM injections. In 15 months old control muscles, in spite of a significant and natural decrease in SRF protein (70&#x00025;) and a concomitant down-regulation of the target <italic>actin</italic> genes, we could not observe a particular muscle phenotype. Similar but milder muscle alterations to those observed in mutant mice could only be observed in very old mice (25 months old; data not shown). Altogether these data strongly suggest that the natural and progressive decrease of SRF could contribute to some of the age-related muscle alterations and that our model of inducible SRF down expression reproduce an accelerated aging process.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Mutant Muscles Develop a Late Fiber-Type Switch and Selective IIB-Myofibers Atrophy</title><p>In steady state conditions, the residual levels of <italic>SRF</italic> and <italic>actin</italic> transcripts seem to be sufficient for the maintenance of normal mature muscle fibers for at least 5 months after TAM injection. However, with time the loss of SRF resulted in a global myofiber atrophy as evidenced by the alteration of the fiber size distribution. Since oxidative myofibers have a smaller CSA, this decrease in fiber size may be due at least in part to the overall switch towards more oxidative fibers that we observed in mutant muscles. This switch in fiber types is associated with an increase of the IIA/IIB fiber ratio which is also in line with an increased oxidative metabolism. This result is in accordance with what we previously observed in the non-inducible muscle-specific SRF KO <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003910-Charvet1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref> and data from the literature showing that SRF activates the fast/glycolytic fiber-specific MyHC IIB gene promoter and represses the fast/oxidative fiber-specific MyHC IIA promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003910-Allen1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>.

Although we cannot exclude that the slow/oxidative phenotype of mutants could be related to a physiological adaptation of muscles to the premature aging, our data support a role for SRF in maintaining the expression of the <italic>MyHC IIB</italic> gene.</p><p>Mutant muscles also develop a selective atrophy of fast MyHC IIB expressing myofibers. Interestingly, it has been reported that the age-related decrease in skeletal muscle mass observed in humans is also caused by a selective atrophy of type II fibres <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003910-Lexell1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. As the starting SRF level is lower in fast/glycolytic muscles than in slow/oxidative ones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003910-Gordon1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, we propose that the down-regulation of SRF in IIB myofibers through normal aging or TAM-induced in mutant mice have earlier impact than in other myofibers types, thus leading to specific atrophy.</p><p>The decreased expression of the <italic>skeletal</italic> and <italic>cardiac &#x003b1;-actin</italic> that occurred in mutant muscle and to a lesser extent in aging muscles could also contribute to the atrophy and to the alterations in sarcomere organization that are observed in mutants. Skeletal &#x003b1;-actin comprises about 90&#x00025; of the muscle actin in adult mouse skeletal muscle and corresponding knockout mice die during the perinatal period from abnormalities in skeletal muscle growth and force generation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003910-Crawford1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. In mutant muscles, the sarcomeric disorganisation was associated with the presence of tubular aggregates that are another sign of muscle senescence.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>A Possible Role for SRF in Controlling Muscle Lipid Content</title><p>The phenotype of sarcopenia includes a loss of muscle mass with an increase in intramuscular fat and connective tissue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003910-Lexell1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003910-Parise1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. In muscles triggered for SRF loss, we observed an important lipid accumulation. We could show that this increased muscle lipid content is due at least in part to <italic>de novo</italic> lipogenesis as the mature form of SREBP1-c is up-regulated and its target gene <italic>FAS</italic> is activated. Most interestingly, several data obtained in different cellular models have already pointed to an inverse correlation between SRF activity and the activation of an adipogenic program. Indeed, the nuclear localisation of SRF is repressed during both senescence and adipocyte differentiation of murine 3T3 mesenchymal stem cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003910-Ding1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. The anticancer drug distamycin A, which induces the adipocyte differentiation of 10T1/2 pluripotential cells, selectively inhibits the binding of SRF to DNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003910-Taylor1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. Mechanical stretch, that is known to activate SRF expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003910-Gordon1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, was shown to inhibit C2C12 myoblast-to-adipocyte differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003910-Akimoto1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. Altogether, our <italic>in vivo</italic> results strongly support an active role for SRF in inhibiting an &#x0201c;adipogenic&#x0201d; program within myofibers. When SRF loss is triggered, such an inhibition would be alleviated, leading to the up-regulation of the mature form of SREBP1-c. However, SRF does not act directly on <italic>SREBP1-c</italic> transcription, as we did not observe any up-regulation of <italic>SREBP1-c</italic> transcripts in mutant muscles. The mechanisms linking SRF to the inhibition of lipid synthesis remains to be investigated.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Role of SRF in Regeneration and Fibrosis</title><p>The regenerative potential of skeletal muscle declines with age and this impairment is associated with an increase in tissue fibrosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003910-Brack1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. In the previous non-inducible muscle-specific SRF KO, we observed that the mutant muscle fails to regenerate. In this model, before injury, muscle lacking SRF presented a myopathy characterized by a drastic myofiber hypotrophy and impaired maturation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003910-Charvet1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. In the new model of inducible SRF loss described here, we show that, 2 months after TAM injection, whereas mutant myofibers lacking SRF appear normal, the regeneration process is also altered, with the presence of smaller regenerated myofibers, persistent endomysial fibrosis and reduced strength. These results emphasize a direct role for SRF during regeneration. In this model, as in the previous one, satellite cells are not targeted by the SRF disruption and their intrinsic properties are preserved <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003910-Charvet1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, alterations in the growth of regenerated muscle fibers in mutant mice most probably stems from a modified satellite cell niche. Such modification could result from an altered myofiber signalling or environment coming from mutant myofibers. The important fibrosis observed in mutant muscles either with aging in mutant muscles or after regeneration suggests that the lack of SRF in myofibers also contributes to modify the environment in a way favouring the appearance and the maintenance of fibrosis. Consistent with this finding, myofibers from transgenic mice expressing a dominant negative form of the MRTF-A SRF co-factor that suppresses SRF activity, also displayed extensive fibrosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003910-Li1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The critical role of age-related changes in the satellite cell niche and the resulting impairment of muscle regeneration has been recently underlined <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003910-Gopinath1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. In this scope, the myofiber itself constitutes one of the main niche components and our model in which it is the only mutated component strongly supports a major role for alterations coming from the myofibers in the age-related process. The particular role of SRF within the myofiber for maintaining a proper satellite cell environment and/or profile of secreted myokines remains to be characterized <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003910-Pedersen1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Modulation of SRF Expression with Aging</title><p>The phenotype of premature aging observed in muscles triggered for SRF loss demonstrates that the significant decrease in the amount of SRF protein that we observed with time in control skeletal muscles could at least in part contribute to the aged-muscle phenotype. Importantly, we could show that SRF expression is also impaired with aging in humans. In accordance with our results, very recently, Sakuma <italic>et al.</italic> reported a decrease in both SRF and MRTF-A with aging, in the skeletal muscle of mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003910-Sakuma2">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover, the expression of SRF targets such as <italic>actin</italic> has been shown to be down-regulated during aging in rats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003910-Piec1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref> and humans (<italic>cardiac &#x003b1;-actin</italic> but also <italic>egr1</italic> and <italic>c-fos</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003910-Dennis1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, the maintenance of SRF expression seems to be critical to ensure a proper response of skeletal muscle to damaging insults and to prevent age-related abnormalities. Interestingly, the fine tuning of SRF expression and activity has also been shown to be very important for the function of the cardiac and smooth muscle tissues. In these tissues, age-related alterations in SRF levels were also associated to pathological states. Hence, in contrast to what we observed in skeletal muscle, SRF expression is increased in the hearts of old rats and mice in the basal conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003910-Azhar1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003910-Lu1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>. This age-related increase correlates with a cardiac pathogenic phenotype that is alleviated when SRF activity is down-regulated through the expression of a mutant SRF protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003910-Azhar1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>. Consistent with these finding, <italic>cardiac &#x003b1;-actin</italic> expression is up-regulated in old myocardium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003910-Jaiswal1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>. An increased expression of SRF and cognate target genes in vascular smooth muscle cells seems to account for the arterial hypercontratility observed in Alzheimer disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003910-Chow1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>. Hence the modulation of SRF expression, function and localisation seems to be very important in maintaining the integrity of muscle tissues. The aging process would alter this tissue-specific fine tuning of SRF expression and activity, leading in turn to the progressive development of further muscle alterations and sarcopenia in human skeletal muscles. Resistance training is currently the most effective known strategy to combat sarcopenia. It is interesting to note that SRF plays a central role in transducing mechanical signals from cell membranes to skeletal fiber nuclei <italic>via</italic> pathways involving integrin &#x003b2;1, RhoA and Focal Adhesion kinase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003910-Carson1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003910-Favier1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>.
