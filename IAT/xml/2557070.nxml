Since its physiological function in these tissues is unknown, we generated a <italic>Slc2a8</italic> null mouse and characterized its phenotype. <italic>Slc2a8</italic> knockout mice appeared healthy and exhibited normal growth, body weight development and glycemic control, indicating that GLUT8 does not play a significant role for maintenance of whole body glucose homeostasis. However, analysis of the offspring distribution of heterozygous mating indicated a lower number of <italic>Slc2a8</italic> knockout offspring (30.5:47.3:22.1%, <italic>Slc2a8<sup>+/+</sup>, Slc2a8<sup>+/&#x02212;</sup>,</italic> and <italic>Slc2a8<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice, respectively) resulting in a deviation (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0024) from the expected Mendelian distribution. This difference was associated with lower ATP levels, a reduced mitochondrial membrane potential and a significant reduction of sperm motility of the <italic>Slc2a8</italic> knockout in comparison to wild-type spermatozoa. In contrast, number and survival rate of spermatozoa were not altered. These data indicate that GLUT8 plays an important role in the energy metabolism of sperm cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>GLUT8</kwd><kwd>glucose transport</kwd><kwd>sperm motility</kwd><kwd>mitochondrial membrane potential</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Facilitated diffusion of glucose into mammalian cells along a concentration gradient is catalyzed by specific carriers (GLUT proteins). The GLUT family comprises 14 members and, according to sequence similarities, can be divided into three classes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Joost &#x00026; Thorens 2001</xref>). GLUT8 belongs to the class 3 transporters and is an intrinsic membrane protein that catalyzes the facilitative transport of glucose and probably also fructose and galactose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Doege et al. 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Ibberson et al. 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Joost &#x00026; Thorens 2001</xref>). A unique feature of class 3 transporters is the presence of endosomal targeting motifs that dictate their intracellular retention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Lisinski et al. 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Augustin et al. 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Schmidt et al. 2006</xref>). So far, translocation of class 3 transporters to the plasma membrane in response to a stimulus has only been demonstrated for GLUT8 in blasto-cysts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Carayannopoulos et al. 2000</xref>) and for the H<sup>+</sup>/myo-inositol transporter HMIT which belongs to the class 3 transporters due to its sequence similarities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Uldry et al. 2004</xref>).</p><p>GLUT8 is expressed predominantly in testis; smaller amounts of GLUT8 mRNA were detected in most other tissues including brain (cerebellum, brain stem, hippocampus, and hypothalamus), spleen, liver, and insulin-sensitive tissues such as heart, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue. GLUT8 was detected in preimplantation embryos, in which it was reported to be essential for the development and survival of the embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Pinto et al. 2002</xref>). In testis, the GLUT8 protein was found to be associated with the acrosomal region of mature spermatozoa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Sch&#x000fc;rmann et al. 2002a</xref>), whereas others detected GLUT8 in differentiating spermatocytes of type 1 stage but not in mature spermatozoa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Ibberson et al. 2002</xref>). GLUT8 may also play a role in adipocyte metabolism because its expression increases markedly during fat cell differentiation, and is sensitive to prolonged hypoxia and glucose deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Scheepers et al. 2001</xref>). However, in adipose cells, GLUT8 does not undergo insulin-stimulated translocation to the plasma membrane as described for the GLUT4 isoform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Lisinski et al. 2001</xref>). In liver, GLUT8 was detected in perivenous hepatocytes, indicating that GLUT8 might have a function in the regulation of glycolytic flux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Gorovits et al. 2003</xref>). Recombinant GLUT8 expressed in COS-7 cells exhibits glucose transport activity when reconstituted into lecithin liposomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Doege et al. 2000</xref>). In addition, high-affinity glucose transport activity (<italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> = 2 mM) was observed in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes after injection of GLUT8 mRNA carrying a mutation of the amino-terminal dileucine motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Ibberson et al. 2000</xref>). This activity was specifically inhibited by Dfructose and D-galactose, indicating that GLUT8 might be a multifunctional sugar transporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Ibberson et al. 2000</xref>).</p><p>In order to analyze the specific role of the intracellular GLUT8 in glucose metabolism and function of sperm cells we generated a null mutant lacking <italic>Slc2a8</italic> and examined its phenotype with the focus on number and motility. While our study was in progress, it was described that targeted disruption of the <italic>Slc2a8</italic> gene in mice caused mild alterations in brain and heart, such as an increased proliferation of hippocampal cells and a slightly impaired transmission of the electrical wave through the atrium leading to a reduction in P-wave (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Membrez et al. 2006</xref>). Here we report data demonstrating that GLUT8 is required for maintaining mitochondrial membrane potential and motility of spermatozoa. This study indicates that the intracellular compartment in which GLUT8 is expressed is needed for transport of metabolites required for energy production.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Antibody</title><p>A polyclonal antibody against two GLUT8-specific peptides corresponding to a sequence of the big intracellular loop (WGSEEGWEEPPVGAEG) and of the C-terminus (KGRTLEQVTAHFEGR) of mouse GLUT8 was raised in rabbit.</p></sec><sec><title>Inactivation of the Slc2a8 gene</title><p>To generate a floxed <italic>Slc2a8</italic> allele we constructed a targeting vector (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Ablation of GLUT8 reduces ATP levels of sperm and sperm motility which results in a slight but significant deviation of offspring from the Mendelian distribution of genotypes. However, sperm number and survival rate as well as glucose transport of sperm cells were unaffected by deletion of GLUT8. Our data give new evidence for an intracellular function of GLUT8, presumably the transfer of sugars or metabolites through membranes in order to maintain energy flow.</p><p>Motility and fertility of spermatozoa are regulated in a complex way. The role of glycolysis for ATP production is controversially discussed in the literature. An important study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Narisawa et al. (2002)</xref> has shown that under conditions of defective mitochondrial phosphorylation the sperm is still able to generate ATP and to fertilize. In addition, targeted deletion of sperm-specific GAPDH, an enzyme located in the fibrous sheath resulted in male sterility which was associated with severe aberrations in sperm motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Miki et al. 2004</xref>). On the other hand, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Ford (2006)</xref> demonstrated that glycolysis is not required to support normal sperm function. Inhibition of glycolysis by &#x003b1;-chlorohydrin did not alter mouse sperm motility. Therefore, beside energy provided by glycolysis sperm depend on production of reactive oxygen intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Fisher &#x00026; Aitken 1997</xref>) and maintenance of &#x00394;&#x003a8;m (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Marchetti et al. 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">2004</xref>). Male mice lacking the enzyme transaldolase (TAL) which indirectly contributes to the generation of NADPH are sterile because spermatozoa lost &#x00394;&#x003a8;m and mitochondrial integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Perl et al. 2006</xref>). The effects on &#x00394;&#x003a8;m and ATP levels in <italic>Slc2a8<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> males did not lead to infertility; <italic>Slc2a8</italic> knockout sperm were able to fertilize <italic>Slc2a8</italic> wild-type oocytes. In addition, no differences in the number of litters or in the number of pups born after crossing <italic>Slc2a8<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> males with <italic>Slc2a8<sup>+/+</sup></italic> females were observed in comparison to an intercross of <italic>Slc2a8<sup>+/+</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table III</xref>). However, the reduced number of motile <italic>Slc2a8</italic> knockout sperm resulted in a moderate but significant reduction of <italic>Slc2a8<sup>+/&#x02212;</sup></italic> (47.3 instead of 50%) and <italic>Slc2a8<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> (22.1 instead of 25%) offspring in the intercross of heterozygous mice when <italic>Slc2a8</italic> wild-type and <italic>Slc2a8</italic> knockout sperm competed for the oocytes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table II</xref>). Altered mitochondria condensation as detected by ultrastructural analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) might participate in the reduction of motility. We hypothesize that knockout sperm cells which exhibit defective mitochondrial condensation during development are those that are immobile after maturation. For the detection of mitochondrial membrane potiential and ATP levels all sperm cells were used including immotile sperm cells. Thereby reduced &#x00394;&#x003a8;m and ATP levels of the <italic>Slc2a8<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> spermatozoa were detected, indicating that the energy supply required for sperm motility was impaired. However, we did not detect differences in glucose uptake between <italic>Slc2a8<sup>+/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Slc2a8<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> sperm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). In addition, spermatozoa express the high-affinity glucose transporter GLUT3 at the cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Haber et al. 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Burant &#x00026; Davidson 1994</xref>). Therefore, it seems unlikely that deletion of GLUT8 which is primarily localized to intracellular membranes of all cell types (spermatocytes, spermatides, mature spermatozoa) impairs glucose uptake in Slc2a8 knockout cells. Rather, we propose that GLUT8 functions in a different, intracellular transport process which is required for mitochondrial function and generation of ATP.</p><p>The role of GLUT8 in the regulation of the energy homeostasis and the metabolism is so far poorly understood. Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Membrez et al. (2006)</xref> described a phenotypical characterization of <italic>Slc2a8<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice and observed normal embryonic and postnatal development, glucose homeostasis and response to mild stress, respectively.

We therefore conclude that GLUT8 does not play a major role in the regulation of energy balance.</p><p>GLUT8 can be expressed in blastocysts and translocated to their surface in response to insulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Carayannopoulos et al. 2000</xref>). In addition, suppression of GLUT8 expression by antisense mRNA caused increased apoptosis of blastocysts, suggesting that GLUT8 plays an essential role in early embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Pinto et al. 2002</xref>). However, our data do not confirm this conclusion. Since mating of knockout mice produced viable, normally developing off-spring in numbers comparable to those of a wild-type intercross (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table III</xref>).</p><p>In summary, our data indicate that deletion of GLUT8 results in reduced sperm motility due to impaired mitochondrial function in spermatozoa, suggesting that GLUT8 is involved in the regulation of energy metabolism of sperm cells.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (GK1208, FOR441, AU178/ 3-1).
