The remodeling of endometrial matrices is a necessary process in the coordination of gestational progress. Matrix-metalloproteinases (MMPs) like gelatinases (MMP-2 and -9) and collagenase (MMP-1) are considered to play important roles in this process. We examined MMP-2 and -9 expression using zymography, in situ hybridization, real-time PCR, and microarray analysis to clarify their roles in the bovine endometrium during gestation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Endometria, placentomes, and fetal membranes were collected from Japanese black cows that were killed on day 15 to 252 of gestation or during their estrous cycle. The gene expression of MMP-related molecules (mainly MMP-2 and -9) was examined using a custom-made microarray, real-time RT-PCR, and in-situ hybridization. Gelatinase activity was detected by zymography and film in situ zymography.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Both gelatinases were expressed in the endometrium and fetal tissues throughout gestation. MMP-2 gene expression declined with the progress of gestation, but its intensity was maintained at a high level during the peri-implantation period and increased in late gestation. The expression level of MMP-9 was stably maintained, but was relatively low compared to that of MMP-2. These gene expression patterns matched those detected by zymography for the proteins. Microarray analysis suggested that the functions of MMP-2 during implantation and the last part of gestation are closely related with those of other molecules such as tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-2, a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs (ADAMTS) 1, membrane type 1 (MT1)-MMP, and extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer (EMMPRIN).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We detected MMP-2 and -9 gene expression in the bovine endometrium and placentome throughout gestation. These data suggest that MMP-2 is one of the main endometrial remodeling factors for implantation and pre-partum in cattle. In cows, as is the case in humans and rodents, gelatinases participate in endometrial remodeling, and their activities depend on the balance of activators and inhibitors; i.e., TIMP, MT-MMP, EMMPRIN, MMP-2, MMP-9, and so on.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Implantation is a complex process and involves various factors such as cytokines and hormones. Degradation and regeneration of the endometrial extra-cellular matrix (ECM) is a vital process that involves matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). MMP, including MMP-2 (gelatinase A) and -9 (gelatinase B), play an important role in tissue remodeling in various physiological and pathological processes, such as implantation, ovarian and uterine functions during peri-partum, wound healing, cancer development etc. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Although the roles of MMP during implantation are known for invasive placentation as occurs in humans and rodents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], knowledge concerning endometrium remodeling in non-invasive placentation, as occurs in ungulates, is limited. The important roles of MMP in endometrial remodeling, especially those of MMP-1 and -2, were reported in sheep [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Interstitial cells are responsible for their production, but epithelial cells are not present in the ovine endometrium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In goats, MMP-2 activity is regulated by co-localized membrane-type 1 MMP (MT1-MMP) and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2 (TIMP-2), and they control endometrium remodeling during gestation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In cattle, trophoblast cells attach to the surface of the epithelium on the caruncle, which is a specific region for implantation, and then the trophoblast cells and endometrial epithelia fuse and make binucleate or multinucleate cells on the caruncle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Although, the roles of MMP have been reported during peri-partum, termination of gestation, and post partum in cows [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], the detailed expression profiles of gelatinases have not been clarified during implantation; namely, the proteolysis mechanisms of the endometrial ECM are still obscure during implantation in cows. Many species of MMP and related molecules participate in this process, including TIMP and MT-MMP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. During the implantation process, trophoblast cells eliminate epithelial cells, and the epithelium is reorganized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Gelatinases may play a significant role in this process. After implantation, the newly formed binucleate and multinucleate cells produce many molecules, peptides, and hormones, such as placental lactogen, pregnancy-associated glycoproteins, prolactin-related proteins, steroid hormones, and heparanase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Compared to invasive placentation, the mechanisms of this type of proteinase is unknown in cows, but it is just as important. Most embryo loss occurs during the early implantation period in cows. The cause of this usually relates to the uterine circumstances, which depend on humoral regulation and may depend on the spacio-temporal condition of the endometrium. Abnormalities in endometrial function cause early embryo loss in many species, and MMPs participate in the regulation of endometrial functions in ruminants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. In the present study, MMP-2 and -9 mRNA were analyzed quantitatively using real-time PCR and microarray analysis, and the expression of their proteins was confirmed by gelatin zymography.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Animals and tissue collection</title><p>Japanese black cows were killed on day 15 to 252 of gestation or during their estrous cycle, and placentomes, endometria, and fetal membranes were collected. Pregnancies were derived by artificial insemination (AI) (day 0 was the day of insemination). Detailed tissue collection data are shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>. Caruncular (CAR), intercaruncular (ICAR), cotyledonay (COT), and intercotyledonary (ICOT) tissues were collected separately for mRNA extraction and zymography. The tissues collection process was as follows: The caruncle area was cut out together with a small area of the intercaruncular endometrium because of the difficulty of complete mechanical separation of the caruncle and intercaruncular tissue. Therefore, the caruncle tissue samples contained a small amount of intercaruncular tissue. The placentome was mechanically divided into the mother side (caruncular septa) and fetal side (cotyledonay villi) tissues; however, they contained a small amount of tissues from the opposite side. On days 15 to 30 of gestation, the cotyledon on the fetal membrane could not be easily identified so the cotyledon samples contained both tissues. A portion of the endometrium and fetal membrane was collected and embedded in OCT compound (Tissue-Tek OCT compound, Sakura Finetechnical Co., Ltd. Tokyo, Japan) for <italic>in situ </italic>zymography. These tissues were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80&#x000b0;C until sectioning. Some uterine samples were perfused with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in 10 mmol PBS l<sup>-1 </sup>(pH 7.4) via the ovarian and uterine arteries. After perfusion, the uteri were separated into non-gravid and gravid horns. Each horn was sliced into sections of about 10 mm thickness and post-fixed in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS overnight at 4&#x000b0;C. The post-fixed tissues were dehydrated in alcohol and xylene, and embedded in paraffin wax. The mounted samples were cut into 5&#x02013;7 &#x003bc;m sections with a rotary microtome HM355 (MICROM Laborger&#x000e4;e GmbH, Heidelberg) and placed onto slides (Matsunami, Tokyo) for <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization analysis.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Tissue collection schedule.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left">Symbol of group</td><td align="left">Actual collection days</td><td align="left">No. of animals</td><td align="left">Definition for purposes</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">Estrous cycle</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">E0</td><td align="left">day 0</td><td align="left">2</td><td align="left">QPCR, in situ hybridization</td></tr><tr><td align="left">E7</td><td align="left">day 7</td><td align="left">2</td><td align="left">QPCR</td></tr><tr><td align="left">E13</td><td align="left">day 13</td><td align="left">2</td><td align="left">microarray</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Gestation</td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Day 15</td><td align="left">day 15*,19, 21*</td><td align="left">3</td><td align="left">QPCR, *zymography (<italic>in situ</italic>)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Day 21</td><td align="left">day 21</td><td align="left">1</td><td align="left"><italic>in situ </italic>hybridization</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Day 25</td><td align="left">day 25</td><td align="left">2</td><td align="left">microarray</td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="left">day 25, 32</td><td align="left">2</td><td align="left">zymography (extraction)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Day 30</td><td align="left">day 27, 30, 34</td><td align="left">3</td><td align="left">QPCR</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Day 60</td><td align="left">day 56, 56, 60, 64</td><td align="left">4</td><td align="left">QPCR, microarray</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Day 150</td><td align="left">day 97, 148, 150</td><td align="left">3</td><td align="left">QPCR, microarray</td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="left">day 144, 148,150</td><td align="left">3</td><td align="left">zymography (extraction)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">Day 250</td><td align="left">day 245, 249, 252</td><td align="left">3</td><td align="left">QPCR, microarray, zymography (extraction)</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>QPCR: Real-time RT-PCR. *: Each of them was used for <italic>in situ </italic>zymography as shown Day 15 and Day 21 in Figure 4.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>All other tissue samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80&#x000b0;C until mRNA and protein extraction.

After day 21, pregnancy was confirmed by transrectal ultrasonography (7.5 MHz linear probe, SSD-1700 Aloka, Tokyo, Japan). The viability of the fetus between days 25 and 60 of gestation was confirmed by a detectable heartbeat 2&#x02013;3 days prior to slaughter.</p></sec><sec><title>cDNA microarray</title><p>We used a custom-made utero-placental cDNA microarray that was developed in our laboratory as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. In brief, a cDNA library was constructed from mRNA isolated from endometrial (caruncular and intercaruncular endometrium) and placental tissues (cotyledonary and intercotyledonary fetal membrane) of Japanese black cows. The PCR products of about 4,000 clones from the cDNA library were robotically spotted onto glass slides. The clones were simultaneously sequenced using the MegaBACE 1000 DNA Sequencing System (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ). The array contained 3,955 spots that were clustered into 1,738 unique genes on the basis of sequence analysis. An additional 35 genes that were not included in the cDNA library but had also been spotted onto the cDNA microarray were used for the analysis since these genes have been shown to be characteristically expressed during gestation in bovines and humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. MMP related genes made up the bulk of this group. The cDNA microarray hybridization procedures were described in previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Briefly, two &#x003bc;g of poly (A)+ RNA were reverse transcribed in the presence of cyanine 3 (Cy3) or Cy5 fluorescence dye (Amersham Biosciences, Buckinghamshire, UK) using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) to make the hybridization probes. Identical samples were labeled separately with either Cy3- or Cy5-dye. Thus, two hybridization reactions could be carried out with the same sample. The arrays were sequentially washed with different concentrations of SSC solutions after 16 hr incubation at 65&#x000b0;C. The arrays were dried by centrifugation at 1,000 &#x000d7; g. Hybridization images were immediately scanned by a GenePix 4000B laser scanner (Axon Instrument, Union City, CA, USA) and analyzed with GenePix Pro 4.0 software. Data normalization was performed by previously described procedures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. The local background intensity of each array spot was smoothed by local weight regression (Lowess) and subtracted from the spot intensity data. The subtracted intensity data were subjected to non-parametric regression and local variance normalization since non-parametric regression can reduce intensity-dependent biases. The accuracy is improved over that of linear regression if the points in the scatter plot of Cy3 versus (vs.) Cy5 are not distributed around a straight line. Data for individual genes were obtained by averaging the intensity values of analogous spots on the microarray. Data were log<sub>2 </sub>transformed and used for cluster analysis. The Cluster 3.0 program was used for the hierarchical clustering. The hierarchically clustered data were visualized using the TreeView 0.99 program (M.B. Eisen's based clustering program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bonsai.ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~mdehoon/software/cluster/software.htm"/>.</p></sec><sec><title>Real time RT-PCR</title><p>The levels of MMP-2 and -9 gene expression were analyzed with real time RT-PCR using a Taqman probe as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Real time PCR primers were designed using sequence data. Partial bovine MMP-2 and -9 mRNA strands were amplified and identified as follows: Total RNA was isolated using ISOGEN (Nippon Gene, Kyoto, Japan), and one microgram of total RNA was subjected to reverse transcription of cDNA with transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After transcription, 5 &#x003bc;l were used for the PCR amplification with DNA polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim). The PCR fragments were subcloned into a TA vector (Invitrogen). Both strands were sequenced with a DNA sequence kit using a sequencer (prism 377 DNA Sequencer ABI). We used oligonucleotide primers for cDNA cloning and quantitative real-time RT-PCR analysis are listed in Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>.

The relative molecular mass (Mr) of gelatinolytic MMP were determined by comparison with SDS-PAGE molecular weight protein markers (Bio-Rad) in the adjacent lane. In order to determine the type of gelatinase observed on the zymograms, in one experiment, 10 mM ethlenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA; Ca<sup>2+ </sup>chelator) was added to the buffer during the incubation period. All procedures were performed as they were for gels without EDTA in the incubation buffer.

We propose that MMP-2 plays a vital role in the cell to cell contact and remodeling of endometrial epithelia and stoma during the implantation period in cows. To support this hypothesis, we gathered various pieces of evidence. First, zymography showed that the MMP-2 activity in the endometrium is highest during the preimplantation period. Second, <italic>in situ </italic>zymography showed that endometrial epithelia and stroma express gelatinase activity during implantation. Third, quantitative PCR revealed that the level of endometrial MMP-2 expression is more than ten-times greater than that of MMP-9. Fourth, microarray data confirmed that MMP-2 expression is higher than those of MMP-9 and other related proteins.</p><p>Endometrial remodeling is essential for successful implantation, and MMP have been shown to regulate this process in various species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. MMP are proteolytic enzymes that depend on zinc and calcium ions, and are the main degradation factors for the ECM in various tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. In non-invasive placenta species, our knowledge of the roles of MMP is limited. In bovines and sheep, the importance of gelatinase activities for placental formation and fetal growth have been reported throughout gestation, and their role in labor was confirmed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. A previous report showed no marked expression of MMP-2 or -9 proteins in the bovine placenta during late gestation, but MMP-2 appeared during labor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Specifically, MMP-2 function seems to be a key factor for the release of the placenta in cows [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. These expression patterns match those found in the present study. This suggests that endometrial gelatinases remain in ruminants during the later half of gestation, and MMP-2 activity recurs around labor. This appearance may be a necessary event for placental release after labor in ruminants, although collagenase plays the main role in the separation of the placenta [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Retention of the fetal membrane is found in bovines as a major post partum problem and collagenase treatment accelerates the release of the fetal membrane. The mechanism of regulation of this process depends on placental cell function and endocrine factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>], which may affect MMP-2 expression and regulation.</p><p>MMP-2 and MMP-9 activity declined in the caruncular area and cotyledon during late gestation but were slightly increased in the inter-caruncular area and inter-cotyledon. This suggests that gelatinases are required for fetal membrane expansion during fetal growth, but placental matrices have to be maintained until delivery to maintain gestation. TIMP-2 is an inhibitory regulation molecule for MMP-2 that is strongly expressed in the endometrium during late gestation, and it may be necessary for maintaining a balance between degradation molecules and their inhibitors.</p><p>Microarray analysis is a useful tool for elucidating the complex expression patterns of many genes simultaneously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. In fact, we examined various MMP related genes with a custom arranged bovine utero-placental cDNA array [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The data obtained suggest that the expression of various MMP-related molecules is scarce but that they each have specific activities that degrade the ECM. Their activities may have a mutual activation process in endometrial degradation. The microarray analysis suggested that ADAMTS1, TIMP-2, and EMMPRIN are involved in MMP-2 expression, but their regulatory mechanisms remain to be studied. In the bovine endometrium, MMP-2 may mediate ECM degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] since its protein production and gene expression were maintained during the implantation period. Then, its appearance decreased with the progression of gestation. ECM including collagen type-I, -IV, laminin, and fibronectin expression declined around the start of implantation both spatially and temporally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. This is compatible with findings from rodents, humans, and even bovines with a non-invasive placenta [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Therefore, MMP-2 may play significant regulatory roles for gelatin and collagen type IV during implantation, even in ruminants. In the current study, MMP-2 expression was lower during the implantation period compared to during the estrous cycle but it still maintained a high level. Zymography showed that the expression intensity of MMP-2 in the endometrium and trophoblasts was higher that of MMP-9 during the peri-implantation period and other gestational periods. These results preliminarily accorded with the microarray and real-time PCR analysis but did not completely match. As we found faint gelatinase activity in the endometrium and fetal tissues, there are discrepancies between the transcription and translation of these enzymes. <italic>In situ </italic>zymography data also suggests that the activation of these enzymes does not depend on the intensity of gene expression and also that activation processes are more important for these enzymes because they are produced from zymogenes. <italic>In situ </italic>hybridization and <italic>in situ </italic>zymography data indicate that the modified enzyme is not required in all areas of the endometrium. Around implantation, trophoblast cells displayed high MMP-2 intensity, and after implantation less than half of MMP-2 was detected in the caruncle. Endometrial stroma cells may produce less MMP-2 around implantation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], and stromal MMP-2 production is regulated by trophoblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. The cell-to-cell interaction depends on the balance of MMP production and inhibition by MT-MMP, TIMP, and EMMPRIN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. Spatial cell interaction at the feto-maternal interface occurs, and specific molecules of fetal origin participate in endometrial remodeling, and trophoblast binucleates may play an important role in this regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. In the current study, TIMP-2 gene expression increased in late gestation. It is difficult to clarify whether TIMP-2 plays a role in the inhibition of MMP-2 or a stimulatory function as a cytokine during this period. Although a microarray analysis supplies comprehensive information, the complex regulatory mechanisms that exist for matrix degradation and remodeling remain unclear. A possible way to examine the complex regulation of MMP is comparative studies in different species with microarrays, with the aim of finding various common genes profiles.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Gelatinase activity is an important factor during implantation in cows as well as in various species that have an invasive type placenta like humans and rodents. MMP-2 gene and protein expression during peri-implantation coincides with ECM degradation in cows. Quantitative PCR and microarray analysis suggest that MMP-2 also participates as a regulatory factor for placental release during labor, and its function may be adjusted by other MMP related molecules, stimulators, and inhibitors.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>KK and KU are both co-first authors and contributed equally to this study.
