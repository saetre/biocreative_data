Among these cell types, photoreceptors account for over 70% of all cells in the retina. In vertebrates, there are two classes of photoreceptors, rods and cones. Rods are sensors of dim light, while cones function in bright light and are responsible for color vision. Phototransduction, a series of signal amplifications detecting a single photon of light, is initiated by the capture of light with 11-cis-retinal, a chromophore bound by the opsin proteins: rhodopsin in rods and cone opsins in cones. The proteins that carry out phototransduction are located in an elaborate and highly specialized membranous structure, the outer segment. The outer segment appears to be relatively fragile, degenerating in response to many environmental and/or genetic perturbations. In the rodent retina, the production of specific cell types during development progresses in a general order [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Rod photoreceptor generation peaks around the time of birth. Cone photoreceptors, ganglion cells, horizontal cells and amacrine cells are generated earlier, while M&#x000fc;ller glia and bipolar cells are generated later. This production of different cell types at different times appears to derive from differences in the intrinsic properties of progenitor cells involved in the transcription or chromatin modification. Recent studies identified several important transcription factors of photoreceptor development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Two <italic>Otx </italic>family homeobox genes, <italic>Otx2 </italic>and <italic>Crx</italic>, play essential roles in early cell fate determination and terminal differentiation of photoreceptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In the absence of Otx2 function, differentiating photoreceptor cells are converted to amacrine-like neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. <italic>Crx</italic>, a downstream target of Otx2, controls the transcription of various photoreceptor cell-specific genes and is essential for the formation of outer segments, synaptic terminals, and phototransduction pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. <italic>Crx </italic>transcripts begin to be expressed in developing photoreceptors at embryonic day 12.5 (E12.5) in the mouse and a strong upregulation of <italic>Crx </italic>transcription is apparent across the differentiating photoreceptors at postnatal day 6 (P6). Photoreceptor cells in the <italic>Crx </italic>knockout (KO) mice exhibit a dramatic reduction of many photoreceptor molecules including visual pigments and develop neither photoreceptor outer segments nor a synaptic terminus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In addition, mutations of human <italic>CRX </italic>have been demonstrated to be associated with three types of photoreceptor diseases: autosomal dominant cone-rod dystrophy 2, autosomal dominant-type retinitis pigmentosa, and Leber's congenital amaurosis (LCA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. While <italic>Otx2 </italic>and <italic>Crx </italic>control general photoreceptor development, three other transcription factors, <italic>TR&#x003b2;2</italic>, <italic>Nrl</italic>, and <italic>Nr2e3 </italic>regulate the specification of photoreceptor cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>SAM domains (also known as Pointed, HLH, or SPM domains) are ~70 residues long and have been reported as common protein-protein interaction modules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. This domain is found in a large number of proteins, including Polycomb group (PcG) proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], serine threonine kinases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], Eph family receptor tyrosine kinases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], the p73 tumor suppressor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], the RNA-binding protein Smaug [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], diacylglycerol kinases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], yeast mating type signaling proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] and ETS family transcription factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. The PcG proteins are transcriptional repressors that maintain gene silencing during development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. In mammals, PcG proteins are also implicated in <italic>Hox </italic>gene regulation. Their biological activity lies in stable silencing of specific sets of genes through chromatin modifications. A member of polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1), ph, contains a SAM domain at the C-terminal, and PRC1 complex is known to form helical, head-to-tail polymers through its SAM domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. These polymeric structures mediate the formation of a higher order chromatin structure and possibly stabilize the repressed state of <italic>Hox </italic>genes.</p><p>In this study, we identified a novel gene, <italic>mr-s</italic>, which encodes a SAM domain-containing protein. The SAM domain of mr-s is most closely related to that of ph mouse ortholog, MPH1/Rae28. <italic>mr-s </italic>is predominantly expressed in retinal photoreceptors when they undergo terminal differentiation, and adult pineal gland. The expression of <italic>mr-s </italic>is directly regulated by Crx. Moreover, mr-s is localized in the nucleus and can self-associate through its SAM domain-containing region. We also found that mr-s protein fused to GAL4 DNA-binding domain functions as a transcriptional repressor. These findings suggest that <italic>mr-s </italic>functions as a member of a transcriptional repressor complex in retinal photoreceptor development.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Cloning of mouse <italic>mr-s</italic></title><p>In order to identify novel mouse genes preferentially expressed in the developing retina, we screened the National Institute for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database, UniGene, using Digital Differential Display (DDD) and found EST fragments which are frequently present in mouse retinal cDNA libraries. We found that one clone in these cDNAs encodes a protein containing a SAM domain related to that of polyhomeotic protein. A PCR fragment corresponding to this mouse clone was used to screen a mouse P0-P3 retinal cDNA library to obtain a full-length cDNA clone. Sequence analysis showed that this cDNA was a novel gene encoding a SAM domain-containing protein. We referred to this protein as mr-s (<underline>m</underline>ajor <underline>r</underline>etinal <underline>S</underline>AM domain protein). As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, a translation initiation codon is present in the same open reading frame as the SAM domain. This initiation site shows similarity to the consensus sequence proposed by Kozak [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] including the presence of the highly conserved purine at position -3. The stop codon of the predicted mr-s protein is also indicated in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>. The amino acid sequence of the SAM domain of mr-s protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, boxed sequence) exhibits homology with SAM domains of EphB2, EphA4, MPH1, TEL and Smaug (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). By phylogenetic analysis, the SAM domain of mr-s is most closely related to that of Mph1/Rae28, a mouse homolog of ph (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). Mouse mr-s protein is conserved in rat, human, chick and zebrafish, which display 91%, 70%, 36% and 26% identity with mouse mr-s, respectively (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). The SAM domains of rat, human, chick and zebrafish mr-s protein are highly conserved and display 96%, 90%, 76% and 72% identity with the SAM domain of mouse mr-s protein. The chromosomal localizations of mouse and human <italic>mr-s </italic>genes were determined by searching the mouse and human genome databases (NCBI), respectively. Mouse <italic>mr-s </italic>is mapped to chromosome 4E2, and human <italic>MR-S </italic>is mapped to chromosome 1p36.33. LCA is the most common cause of inherited childhood blindness.

No hybridization signal was detected at E9.5, E10.5 and E11.5 with an <italic>mr-s </italic>probe (data not shown). We then investigated the expression of the <italic>mr-s </italic>gene in the developing retina by section <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A&#x02013;G</xref>). No significant signal was detected in the developing retina at E13 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). A weak signal was initially detected in the outer aspect of the neuroblastic layer (NBL), a presumptive photoreceptor layer at E18 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, arrow). At P3, an <italic>mr-s </italic>transcript was clearly detected in the developing photoreceptor layer (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref>). At P6, <italic>mr-s </italic>showed peak expression in the photoreceptor layer (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2F</xref>). This pattern correlates with the rapid increase in cells expressing <italic>rhodopsin </italic>and other phototransduction genes between P6-P8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. At P9, the intensity of the <italic>mr-s </italic>signal was significantly reduced but was localized to the outer nuclear layer (ONL) (data not shown).

As a control, P7 retinal RNA was used. Four bands corresponding to 7.2-kb, 4.0-kb, 2.5-kb and 2.2-kb were detected in P7 retina. The 2.2-kb band corresponds to the cDNA characterized in this study. The larger bands, possibly alternative spliced transcripts, have not yet been characterized. The <italic>mr-s </italic>probe did not detect a band in the adult tissues examined, indicating that these tissues do not express <italic>mr-s </italic>at a level comparable to that of the developing retina.</p><p>Previous reports revealed that many photoreceptor-specific genes are also expressed in the pineal gland [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].

Although both <italic>Otx2 </italic>and <italic>Crx </italic>are expressed in developing photoreceptor cells in the embryonic retina, only <italic>Crx </italic>is highly expressed in the postnatal photoreceptors, suggesting that <italic>mr-s </italic>may be regulated by Crx. To test whether Crx regulates <italic>mr-s </italic>transcription, we performed <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization of <italic>mr-s </italic>mRNA on wild-type and <italic>Crx </italic>KO P5 retinas (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A, B</xref>). In the <italic>Crx </italic>KO retina, the <italic>mr-s </italic>transcript was dramatically reduced (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). This indicates that Crx is essential for transactivation of <italic>mr-s</italic>.

The results revealed that <italic>mr-s </italic>transcription was significantly downregulated in the <italic>Crx </italic>KO pineal gland.

This 1.2-kb region of the <italic>mr-s </italic>upstream sequence contains three Crx binding consensus sequences.

A previous report suggested that the transcriptional activity of Crx is augmented with Nrl when the <italic>rhodopsin </italic>promoter was used as a reporter gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. On the other hand, our present data showed that the luciferase gene expression was not upregulated when both <italic>Crx </italic>and <italic>Nrl </italic>expression vectors were co-introduced with Pro1.2k compared to the activity when the <italic>Crx </italic>only expression vector was introduced. This may be due to cell type differences because a cell type of retinal/pineal origin was not used in our luciferase assay. In addition, our present data showed that Otx2, which is reported to have the same binding consensus as Crx, also transactivated <italic>mr-s </italic>expression. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A&#x02013;F</xref>, the expression pattern of <italic>mr-s </italic>correlates with that of <italic>Crx</italic>. In contrast, the transcripts of <italic>Otx2 </italic>are mainly detected in the photoreceptor layer at embryonic stages. Therefore, we concluded that <italic>mr-s </italic>transcription is directly regulated mainly by Crx.</p><p>We also constructed reporter vectors in which mutations were introduced at the three Crx binding sites (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>, mut1259, mut198, mut72, mut all). Then the <italic>Crx </italic>expression vector was co-introduced with mut1259, mut198, mut72 and mut all, respectively (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3F</xref>). The transactivaton activity by Crx was clearly reduced when mut198 or mut72 was co-introduced. On the other hand, when mut1259 was co-transfected, the transactivation activity by Crx was not altered. These results suggest that the Crx binding sites 72-bp and 198-bp upstream from the transcription initiation site are crucial for the direct regulation of <italic>mr-s </italic>transcription by Crx.</p></sec><sec><title>Self-association of mr-s protein</title><p>SAM domains are known to function as protein-protein interaction modules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Although SAM domains can bind to various non-SAM domain-containing proteins, many homo-SAM and hetero-SAM domain interactions have been reported. To investigate whether the SAM domain of the mr-s protein can also function as a protein-protein interaction module, we performed yeast two-hybrid screening using full-length mr-s protein as the bait. Using this bait, we screened the transcriptional activator fusion protein library in which mouse P0-P3 retinal cDNAs were fused to the GAL4 activation domain. The most frequent positive clones (5 out of 28) were cDNA fragments containing the SAM domain of mr-s (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). This result strongly suggests that mr-s protein self-associates through SAM domain-containing regions. We then directly tested this self-association of mr-s protein in yeast. We fused full-length or truncated portions of the mr-s protein to the DNA-binding domain of the yeast transcription factor GAL4 to make bait constructs. We fused full-length or truncated portions of the mr-s protein to the GAL4 transcriptional activation domain to make prey constructs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). These constructs were transformed into yeast that contain a transgene with GAL4 binding sites upstream of the <italic>lacZ </italic>gene. We found that the full-length mr-s bait construct induced <italic>lacZ </italic>expression with the full-length mr-s prey construct (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>, full &#x000d7; full). The N-terminus 400 amino acid (aa) stretch of mr-s, which does not contain a SAM domain, does weakly activate transcription of <italic>lacZ </italic>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>, full &#x000d7; N). The N-terminus 400 aa stretch of mr-s was able to induce transcription of <italic>lacZ </italic>weakly with the same N-terminus 400 aa stretch of mr-s (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>, N &#x000d7; N). Although the N-terminus 400 aa mr-s protein weakly activates <italic>lacZ </italic>transcription with the same N-terminus portion, a much stronger activation of <italic>lacZ </italic>expression was observed with a C-terminus portion encoding the 391&#x02013;542 aa stretch of mr-s (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>, full &#x000d7; C, C &#x000d7; C). Our GAL4 assay indicated that the signal when the full-length mr-s was present in both the bait and prey contexts was weaker than when isolated SAM domains were used. This may simply reflect the tendency for the small fusion proteins to enter the yeast nucleus and occupy GAL4 binding sites. Alternatively, the SAM domain may be less accessible for interaction in the full-length protein context as previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Summary of yeast two-hybrid screening and GAL4 assay. </bold>(A) Full-length <italic>mr-s </italic>as a bait used in the yeast two-hybrid screening and positive clones are indicated.

Based on this result, we introduced two types of site-directed mutations, which correspond to the mutations introduced in ph protein, into Flag-tagged full-length mr-s (Flag-W404A and Flag-G453A). We found that Flag-W404A binding activity was significantly reduced and Flag-G453A binding activity was also slightly reduced compared to Flag-mrs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>).

Ph functions as a transcriptional repressor through its polymerization and protein-protein interaction with other sequence-specific transcriptional repressors, which can form a higher order chromatin structure. The mr-s protein also does not have an obvious DNA-binding domain. To characterize the biochemical activity of mr-s, we next performed a luciferase assay. We generated effector plasmids, which express various deletion constructs of mr-s fused to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>). We first confirmed that full-length mr-s fused to GAL4 DNA binding domain (DBD-mrs) had no effect on the pGL3 promoter plasmid lacking GAL4 binding sites (data not shown). When the 5xGAL4-pGL3 reporter plasmid was co-transfected, DBD-mrs repressed luciferase activity by about 90% in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>). As a control, GAL4 DNA-binding domain (DBD) had no significant effect on the 5xGAL4-pGL3 reporter plasmid. In addition, we confirmed that full-length mr-s without GAL4 DBD had no effect on the same reporter plasmid (data not shown). We next analyzed deletion constructs in which the N-terminus 400 aa stretch of mr-s (amino acids 1 to 400) or the C-terminus portion (amino acids 391 to 542) were fused to the GAL4 DBD (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>, DBD-N, DBD-C). While DBD-N had no repressive effect on this reporter activity, DBD-C repressed luciferase gene expression by about 65%. This result suggested to us the possibility that DBD-mrs exerts transcriptional repressive activity via self-association through its SAM domain. To investigate whether the homophilic association of mr-s is required for transcriptional repression, two site-directed mutants, DBD-W404A and DBD-G453A, either of which may reduce self-binding ability, were analyzed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C</xref>). Compared to DBD-mrs, DBD-W404A and DBD-G453A had repression activity of 72% and 87%, respectively. While the ability of mr-s self-association partially correlates with transcriptional repressive activity, these mutants do not compromise the ability to repress transcription critically. To determine the regions of mr-s involved in transcriptional repression more precisely, the C-terminus portion was divided into two regions and each was fused to the GAL4 DBD (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>, DBD-tail, DBD-SAM). As a consequence, DBD-SAM (amino acids 384 to 462) did not have a repressive effect on the 5xGAL4-pGL3 reporter plasmid. On the other hand, luciferase activity was repressed by 55% when DBD-tail (amino acids 459 to 542) was co-transfected with this reporter plasmid (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7D</xref>). To assess the transcriptional repressive activity of mr-s in cells of retinal origin, we performed similar experiments using human Y79 retinoblastoma cells. The results indicated that DBD-mrs also reduced luciferase activity significantly in Y79 retinoblastoma cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7E</xref>). However, luciferase activity was repressed by about 30% in Y79 cells, while it was repressed by 90% in HEK293T cells. This might be due to the difference in transfection efficiency between these cell lines. Another possibility is that intracellular environment in Y79 cells, a retinoblastoma cell line, is insufficient for recapitulating developing photoreceptors. In this study, we did not address the question whether or not our <italic>in vitro </italic>data reflect native mr-s transcriptional repression <italic>in vivo</italic>. However, these <italic>in vitro </italic>experiments using HEK293T and Y79 cells strongly support our hypothesis that mr-s functions as a transcriptional repressor in developing photoreceptors. Our results suggested that the C-terminal region of mr-s (amino acids 463 to 542) is required for transcriptional repression of mr-s and the SAM domain appears to be dispensable for this repressive activity. This C-terminal region of mouse mr-s is highly conserved among species (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7F</xref>). The sequence identity of the region was 93%, 73%, 41% and 40% for rat, human, chick and zebrafish, respectively (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). This strongly suggests that the C-terminal region of mouse mr-s functions as a transcriptional repressive domain in photoreceptor development. However, this region does not contain characteristic amino acid motifs and the mechanism through which the region achieves and/or maintains gene repression remains to be clarified in the future.</p><fig position="float" id="F7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p><bold>mr-s fused to GAL4 DNA binding domain functions as a transcriptional repressor in HEK293T cells. </bold>(A) Schematic drawing of the constructs used for the luciferase assay. 5xGAL4-pGL3 reporter plasmid was co-transfected into HEK293T cells with effector plasmids expressing various deletion mutants fused to GAL4-DBD.

The peak of <italic>mr-s </italic>expression in the developing retina is around P6. This expression pattern correlates with the rapid increase of <italic>Crx</italic>, <italic>rhodopsin </italic>and other photoreceptor genes around P6-P8. Around P6, the outer plexiform layer becomes visible and the outer layer of retina separates into two layers, ONL and INL. At the same time, photoreceptors begin to undergo terminal differentiation, forming the outer segment. We therefore hypothesized that <italic>mr-s </italic>is a key molecule in the late development of photoreceptors.</p><p>We previously reported that <italic>Otx2 </italic>and <italic>Crx </italic>have a critical role in photoreceptor development and that Otx2 directly regulates <italic>Crx </italic>transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. <italic>In situ </italic>hybridization and RT-PCR showed significant reduction of <italic>mr-s </italic>signal in the <italic>Crx </italic>KO retina and pineal gland. Furthermore, the luciferase assay demonstrated that Otx2 and Crx may directly upregulate the transcription of <italic>mr-s </italic>in mammalian cells. In retinal photoreceptor cells, the <italic>Otx2 </italic>transcripts are not highly expressed at P6-P9, while the <italic>Crx </italic>transcripts are strongly detected around P6. Therefore, our results strongly suggest that <italic>mr-s </italic>transcription is directly regulated by Crx. In the present study, <italic>Nrl</italic>, a photoreceptor-specific transcription factor that is highly expressed in photoreceptors at the postnatal stage, did not affect the transcription of <italic>mr-s</italic>. This finding is actually consistent with the analysis of the <italic>Nrl </italic>KO mouse which was recently reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. The expression profiles of wild-type and <italic>Nrl </italic>KO retinas at P2, P10 and 2 months were analyzed and <italic>mr-s </italic>was not included in 161 differentially expressed genes in the <italic>Nrl </italic>KO retina.</p><p>Previous reports suggested that the SAM domain is a protein-protein interaction module. The SAM domain of the mr-s protein is closely related to that of ph and TEL, whose SAM domains can form a helical, head-to-tail polymeric structure and mediate the formation of a higher order chromatin structure. To characterize the biochemical function of mr-s, we performed yeast two-hybrid screening using full-length mr-s as the bait. As a result, the most frequent positive clones (5/28) in the screening were the cDNA fragments containing the SAM domain of mr-s. This strongly suggests that mr-s self-associates through its SAM domain. An immunoprecipitation assay, using two site-directed mutants of the SAM domain of mr-s, demonstrated that the mr-s protein can self-associate through its SAM domain in mammalian cells. While we did not address the question whether the SAM domain of mr-s forms a polymeric structure in the present study, the phylogenetic analysis of SAM domain of mr-s and other SAM domain-containing molecules suggests that mr-s can form head-to-tail polymer and mediate gene silencing by spreading repressive complexes along the chromatin similar to ph and/or TEL. Although our results in the immunoprecipitation assay demonstrated that the N-terminal constructs lacking a SAM domain still interact with each other, these results do not fit into the head-to-tail polymer model. We cannot exclude the possibility that the resulting protein-protein interaction of mr-s is an artifact of the overexpression conditions. The issue of whether or not mr-s forms a polymer awaits future analysis.</p><p>A previous report indicated that TEL contains a sequence-specific DNA binding domain, namely the ETS domain, and binds to specific sites via its ETS domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. TEL could serve to nucleate a polymer, which would spread by oligomerization of the SAM domain. In contrast to TEL, ph does not contain an obvious sequence-specific DNA binding motif (16). Therefore, its initial binding to the template may require protein-protein interactions with other sequence-specific transcriptional repressors. The segmentation gene-encoding transcriptional repressors such as Hunchback have a role in recruiting SAM domain-containing PcG proteins, which can spread along the template via polymerization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Since mr-s does not contain obvious DNA binding motifs, we suppose that there is a sequence-specific transcription factor(s) which interacts with mr-s. However, we did not find any transcription factors in the present yeast two-hybrid screening.</p><p>We also found that full-length mr-s fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain (DBD-mrs) functions as a transcriptional repressor. This may support the idea that mr-s is involved in repressive complexes similar to other SAM domain-containing proteins. Our results, however, showed that the self-association of mr-s through its SAM domain is not essential for the transcriptional repressive activity. Polymerization of the SAM domain has been previously reported to be essential for the repressive functions of ph and TEL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. On the other hand, human lethal(3) malignant brain tumor (H-L(3)MBT) protein, which also contains a SAM domain at the C-terminus, was reported as a transcriptional repressor and the repressor activity of H-L(3)MBT required mainly the presence of the MBT repeats but not the SAM domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. To determine the transcriptional repressor region of the mr-s protein, we performed a luciferase assay using site-directed mutants (DBD-W404A and DBD-G453A). The result showed that the reduced binding ability of self-association partially compromises the transcriptional repressive activity of mr-s (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7D</xref>). However, the repressive effect was more significant when DBD-tail, which does not contain SAM domain, was co-introduced with the 5xGAL4-pGL3 reporter plasmid. Therefore, we conclude that a region from amino acids 463 to 542 is mainly responsible for the repressor activity in the case of mr-s. Evolutionary conservation of the C-terminal 80 aa region of mr-s from zebrafish through human may underlie the functional importance of this region.</p><p>Two distinct multiprotein PcG complexes, PRC1 and PRC2, have been identified. PRC2 is involved in the initiation of silencing and contains histone deacetylases (HDACs) and histone methyltransferases, which can methylate histone H3 lysine 9 and 27, marks of silenced chromatin. PRC1, including ph, recognizes the histone H3 lysine 27 mark set by PRC2 and maintains a stable state of gene repression in which PRC1 blocks chromatin remodeling by the trithorax group-related SWI-SNF complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. Therefore, the mechanism of repression by PRC2 is thought to be HDAC-dependent while the mechanism of repression by PRC1 appears to be HDAC-independent. Our luciferase assay also showed that transcriptional repression of DBD-mrs was not affected by the addition of various concentrations of trichostatin A, a potent HDAC inhibitor (data not shown). Therefore, we speculate that the mechanism of repression of mr-s may be HDAC-independent and more similar to that of PRC1 complex.</p><p>In the present study, the biochemical experiments demonstrate that the mr-s protein functions as a transcriptional repressor and possibly down-regulates the spatial and temporal expression of the target genes during retinal photoreceptor development. Our data also revealed that the repressive activity of mr-s is mainly due to the C-terminal region (amino acids 463 to 542). However, downstream targets of <italic>mr-s </italic>still remain unclear. <italic>In situ </italic>hybridization showed that the peak of <italic>mr-s </italic>expression is around P6, when retinal photoreceptors undergo terminal differentiation. We hypothesize that the target genes of mr-s might be non-photoreceptor genes. In this case, mr-s may suppress the expression of non-photoreceptor genes in rod and cone photoreceptors. There may be another possibility that mr-s is involved in cell fate determination of rod photoreceptors versus cone photoreceptors. While cone photoreceptors are born during the early embryonic stages of mouse retinogenesis, rod photoreceptors are born primarily in the late embryonic and early postnatal period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. The expression pattern of <italic>mr-s </italic>may suggest that <italic>mr-s </italic>is expressed in rod photoreceptors but not in cone photoreceptors as well as Nr2e3, which is known as a transcriptional repressor and is thought to down-regulate cone photoreceptor-specific genes. To clarify the biological function of <italic>mr-s</italic>, analysis of mice with targeted disruptions of <italic>mr-s </italic>will be very important.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Here we identified mouse <italic>mr-s</italic>, which is predominantly expressed in retinal photoreceptors and the pineal gland. <italic>mr-s </italic>is evolutionarily conserved from zebrafish through to human, suggesting a significant role of <italic>mr-s </italic>in photoreceptor development.

Product size was 292 bp (positions 965&#x02013;1256 of Genbank Accession Number <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="#AY458844">#AY458844</ext-link>). Primer pairs for mouse <italic>G3PDH </italic>were 5'-ACCACAGTCCATGCCATCAC-3' and 5'-TCCACCACCCTGTTGCTGTA- 3' which amplified a 452-bp product (positions 587&#x02013;1038 of Genbank Accession Number <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="#BC85275">#BC85275</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec><title>Yeast two-hybrid screening and GAL4 assay</title><p>We carried out yeast two-hybrid experiments using the MATCHMAKER GAL4 two-hybrid system 3 (BD Bioscience) as recommended by the manufacturer. We cloned the full-length mr-s into the pGBKT7 vector and used it to screen a library of mouse P0-P3 retinal cDNAs in the pGADT7 vector. Transformants that conferred growth were picked, isolated and re-introduced with the bait into AH109 to confirm interaction. Plasmid DNA was isolated from yeast using RPM Yeast Plasmid Isolation Kit (Qbiogene). In order to confirm the protein interactions, single colonies were picked and grown individually in synthetic complete media lacking leucine, tryptophan and containing X-gal. After 4&#x02013;5 days, X-gal positive clones were selected and analyzed. To test self-interaction of mr-s, we subcloned the full-length, N-terminus (amino acids 1&#x02013;400) and C-terminus (amino acids 391&#x02013;542) of mr-s into pGBKT7 and pGADT7 vectors. We assessed interactions by scoring blue color on plates of medium containing X-gal.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunoprecipitation assay</title><p>For immunoprecipitation assay, 4&#x000d7; hemagglutinin (HA) or 3&#x000d7; Flag tagged cDNA fragment encoding full-length <italic>mr-s </italic>(full-HA and Flag-mrs), a cDNA fragment encoding amino acids 1&#x02013;400 (&#x00394;SAM-HA and Flag-&#x00394;SAM), and a cDNA fragment encoding amino acids 400&#x02013;542 (Flag-SAM) were subcloned into the pcDNA3 (Invitrogen) expression vector. We also constructed two site-directed mutants, Flag-W404A and Flag-G453A, using PCR. Each of these mutations was also introduced into Flag-mr-s. We transfected HEK293T cells with 5 &#x003bc;g of plasmid DNA per 6 cm dish by calcium phosphate method. Approximately 48 hr after transfection, cells were harvested in immunoprecipitation buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 1 mM EDTA, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride [Wako], 1% Nonidet P-40, 10% glycerol) in the presence of protease inhibitor cocktail tablets (Roche). For each reaction, 1 mg of cell lysate was mixed with 0.5 &#x003bc;g of anti-Flag antibody (SIGMA, F3165) and 15 &#x003bc;l of protein G-Sepharose (Amersham) on a rotating wheel at 4&#x000b0;C for 2 hrs. Protein concentration was determined by the BCA protein assay system (Pierce). The beads were then washed three times with immunoprecipitation buffer and followed by three times with wash buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>). Proteins were then boiled for 5 min in SDS sample buffer (1% SDS, 1 mM Tris [pH 6.8], 40 mM DTT, 4% glycerol, 0.01% pyronine Y). The supernatants were fractionated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and transferred to the nitrocellulose membrane (Trans-Blot Transfer Medium, Bio-Rad). Western blotting was performed with rabbit polyclonal anti-HA antibody (Santa Cruz, #sc-805). Signals were detected with horseradish peroxidase- conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG and ECL plus Western Blotting Detection System (Amersham).</p></sec><sec><title>Subcellular localization analysis</title><p>We transfected the plasmid encoding HA-tagged full-length mr-s into HEK293T cells, seeded cells on coverslips coated with collagen 48 hr after transfection, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at room temperature for 20 min, and washed with PBS. Then we permeabilized cells in PBS containing 0.1% Triton X-100 for 15 min, washed again with PBS, and incubated in PBS containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 30 min at room temperature. We incubated cells with anti-HA antibody overnight at 4&#x000b0;C (1:200 in PBS containing 0.2% BSA). The following day, we washed cells three times with PBS and incubated with a Cy3-conjugated goat IgG against rabbit IgG (1:400 in PBS, Jackson ImmunoReseach Laboratories) for 30 min. We rinsed cells three times with PBS, followed by observation using a confocal microscope FV300 (Olympus) equipped with a 60&#x000d7; objective lens.</p></sec><sec><title>Luciferase assay</title><p>For transcriptional analysis of the 1.2-kb promoter region of mr-s, we constructed a reporter plasmid (pro1.2k) by subcloning a 1.2-kb upstream genomic fragment of <italic>mr-s </italic>gene into a pGL3 luciferase reporter plasmid (Promega). The expression vectors were constructed by subcloning full-length <italic>Crx</italic>, <italic>Otx2, Nrl </italic>genes into a pMIK expression vector (a gift from Dr. K. Maruyama), respectively. For the "mut1259" vector, the Crx binding site at the -1259 bp position was mutated by replacing GGATTA with AGATCT. For the "mut198" vector, the Crx binding site at the -198 bp position was mutated by replacing TAATCC with GAATTC. For the "mut72" vector, the Crx binding site at the -72 bp position was mutated by replacing GGATTA with GAATTC. For the "mut all" vector, all of three Crx binding sites were mutated. 5xGAL4-pGL3 Control reporter plasmid, which contains five copies of the GAL4 DNA recognition sequence positioned immediately upstream of SV40 minimal promoter, was kindly gifted from Dr. T. Noguchi and used for analysis of the transcriptional activity of mr-s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. To generate effector plasmids, various deletion fragments were produced by PCR reaction and subcloned into pGBKT7 vector, respectively. These fragments were digested with the sequence, which encodes GAL4 DNA binding domain, and inserted into pcDNA3. We transfected 0.1 &#x003bc;g of reporter plasmid DNA and 2 &#x003bc;g of the expression vector DNA per 6 cm dish into HEK293T cells using Fugene6 transfection reagent. We analyzed luciferase activity 48 hr after transfection.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>List of abbreviations</title><p>Crx, cone-rod homeobox; Otx2, orthodenticle-related homeobox 2; TR&#x003b2;2, thyroid hormone receptor beta 2; Nrl, neural retina leucine zipper; Nr2e3, nuclear receptor subfamily 2 group E member 3; EST, expressed sequence tag; EphB2, ephrin receptor B2; EphA4, ephrin receptor A4; TEL, translocation ETS leukemia.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>TI and KT performed most of the experiments, interpreted the data and wrote the first draft of the manuscript.
