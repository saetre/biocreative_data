Here, we show in mouse that Sox5 expression also continues after neural crest specification in the melanocyte lineage. Despite its continued expression, Sox5 has little impact on melanocyte development on its own as generation of melanoblasts and melanocytes is unaltered in Sox5-deficient mice. Loss of <italic>Sox5</italic>, however, partially rescued the strongly reduced melanoblast generation and marker gene expression in <italic>Sox10</italic> heterozygous mice arguing that Sox5 functions in the melanocyte lineage by modulating Sox10 activity. This modulatory activity involved Sox5 binding and recruitment of CtBP2 and HDAC1 to the regulatory regions of melanocytic Sox10 target genes and direct inhibition of Sox10-dependent promoter activation. Both binding site competition and recruitment of corepressors thus help Sox5 to modulate the activity of Sox10 in the melanocyte lineage.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Many transcription factors of the Sox protein family are widely expressed in the vertebrate embryo and represent important developmental regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Several subgroups can be distinguished, one of them is the SoxD group. SoxD proteins do not only share a high degree of amino acid similarity, but also a number of biochemical features that make them unique among Sox proteins. For one, SoxD proteins exist in several isoforms that are generated by alternative splicing from rather large genes with multiple exons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). This is uncommon for Sox proteins which are usually encoded by intronless genes or compact genes with few exons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). As a consequence, SoxD proteins exist in short and long isoforms. Only the long isoforms contain a characteristic coiled-coil domain that allows these proteins to homodimerize or heterodimerize with other SoxD proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). In fact, the long SoxD isoforms are the only Sox proteins known to exist as dimers in solution. SoxD proteins furthermore differ from other Sox proteins in that they do not appear to have a typical transactivation domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>) arguing that SoxD proteins influence transcription in other ways.</p><p>Vertebrates possess the three highly related proteins Sox5, Sox6 and Sox13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3 B4 B5">3&#x02013;5</xref>). Each of them is expressed widely during embryogenesis. All three SoxD genes have been deleted in the mouse and found to influence a wide range of developmental processes including the development of chondrocytes, oligodendrocytes, corticofugal neurons, erythrocytes, T lymphocytes, the notochord and the heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6 B7 B8 B9 B10 B11 B12 B13">6&#x02013;13</xref>). During some of these events, SoxD proteins primarily function as modulators of the SoxE proteins Sox9 and Sox10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>), whereas this is not the case in other developmental processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Sox5, in particular, has been found to influence chondrocyte development by cooperating with and reinforcing the activity of Sox9 on several of its chondrocytic target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>), whereas its impact on oligodendrocyte maturation appears to be primarily due to its ability to counteract the activity of Sox10 on several of its oligodendroglial target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). In agreement with its numerous functions, Sox5 cannot be deleted in mice without severe consequences and Sox5-deficient mice die at birth because of respiratory distress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>).</p><p>In the chicken, Sox5 is also expressed in the neural crest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). In the cranial neural crest, Sox5 was found in premigratory and migratory neural crest cells, but also in some neural crest derivatives, in particular in the glial components of the peripheral nerves and ganglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Its importance for neural crest development had furthermore been inferred from ectopic expression in the electroporated neural tube, where it promoted the generation of additional neural crest cells. Sox5 also occurs in neural crest cells of the mouse (C.S. and M.W., unpublished data). Whether its role in the neural crest involves a functional interplay with Sox9 or Sox10 has not been analyzed so far. It has to be noted, however, that both Sox9 and Sox10 are strongly expressed in the neural crest and regulate various phases of neural crest development. Sox9, for instance, is involved in defining the premigratory neural crest cell, ensures its survival and allows its epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, whereas Sox10 is essential for survival of migratory neural crest cells and maintenance of their pluripotency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Additionally, both SoxE proteins influence several cell fate decisions in the neural crest at later stages of development, with Sox9 being important for acquisition of the chondrocytic fate of cranial neural crest cells and Sox10 driving glial and melanocytic specification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>).</p><p>Melanocytes are derived from neural crest cells that migrate on a dorsolateral pathway immediately below the epidermis. Cells specified to become melanoblasts are recognizable by their expression of several markers, including the receptor tyrosine kinase c-Kit, the dopachrome tautomerase Dct and the basic helix&#x02013;loop&#x02013;helix transcription factor Mitf (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). In fact, Mitf is the master regulator of melanocyte development and the onset of its expression during development distinguishes a migrating neural crest cell from a melanoblast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Induction of <italic>Mitf</italic> expression in the specified melanoblast is dependent on Sox10 and Pax3, thus explaining why Sox10 is essential for melanocyte development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22 B23 B24">22&#x02013;24</xref>). There is good evidence that <italic>Mitf</italic> is a direct target gene of Sox10 and probably also of Pax3 in neural crest cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25 B26 B27 B28 B29">25&#x02013;29</xref>). Once induced, Mitf has to be stimulated in its activity by ERK-dependent phosphorylation upon c-Kit activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). One of the earliest genes induced by Mitf in melanoblasts is <italic>Dct</italic> and this induction occurs in synergy with Sox10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31 B32 B33 B34">31&#x02013;34</xref>). In contrast to the functions of Sox10, Mitf and c-Kit in melanoblasts, those of Dct are not known, but seem to be nonessential and different from its later role in melanin production in differentiated melanocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>).</p><p>Here, we report that Sox5 is expressed in melanoblasts during mouse development and analyze its function, in particular, in relation to Sox10 as a known major regulator of melanocyte development.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Animal husbandry, genotyping, tissue preparation, immunohistochemistry and <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization</title><p>Starting with <italic>Sox10<sup>+/lacZ</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>) on a pure C3HeB/FeJ genetic background and <italic>Sox5<sup>+/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>) backcrossed for at least four generation on the same C3HeB/FeJ background, double heterozygous mice were obtained whose intercrossing or breeding with <italic>Sox5<sup>+/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice generated offspring with various combinations of <italic>Sox5<sup>&#x02212;</sup></italic> and <italic>Sox10<sup>lacZ</sup></italic> alleles.

Depending on the studied organism, <italic>Mitf</italic> gene activation has been proposed to be one of the essential functions or the sole essential task of Sox10 during melanocyte development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). Multiple binding sites for Sox10 have been mapped within the <italic>Mitf</italic> and <italic>Dct</italic> promoters. These sites have been found to differentially contribute to overall promoter activation. In the <italic>Dct</italic> promoter, the S1 and the S4/4&#x02032; sites have been reported to be mainly responsible for the Sox10-dependent induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). The same holds true for site 5 in case of the <italic>Mitf</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). The S1 site from the <italic>Dct</italic> promoter and the site 5 from the <italic>Mitf</italic> promoter are furthermore representative of response elements recognized by Sox10 monomers, whereas S4/4&#x02032; allows binding of Sox10 dimers as evident from the mobility of the Sox10-containing complexes on these sites in EMSA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). We asked whether Sox5 has the capacity to recognize these response elements. When EMSA were performed with the long isoform of Sox5 that we had detected in melanoblasts at 10.5 dpc, binding was detected to all three sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A). From the comparable mobility of the Sox5-containing complex on site 5 and S1 relative to the S4/4&#x02032; site, it can furthermore be concluded that the L-Sox5 isoform binds to all sites as a dimer in agreement with its constitutive dimerization in solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). <fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Sox5 recognizes binding sites for Sox10 in the <italic>Dct</italic> and <italic>Mitf</italic> promoters.

For better visualization, a carboxyterminally truncated Sox10 version was used. In EMSA, only complexes were observed whose mobility corresponded to the Sox5- or the Sox10-containing complex. Additional supershift experiments with Sox5- and Sox10-specific antibodies confirmed that the complexes with Sox5- or Sox10-specific mobility indeed contained only one of the two Sox proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B&#x02013;D). Similar results were obtained when full-length Sox10 was used instead of the truncated version (data not shown). From the unchanged composition of the complexes and our failure to obtain novel complexes with intermediate or higher mobility, a mutually exclusive mode of binding is concluded. This was also confirmed in titration experiments in which increasing amounts of Sox10 were capable of displacing a fixed amount of Sox5 from S4/4&#x02032; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>E) just as increasing amounts of Sox5 were capable of displacing a fixed amount of Sox10 without the appearance of any additional complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>F).</p></sec><sec><title>Sox5 prevents Sox10 from inducing the promoters of its melanocytic target genes</title><p>We next addressed the ability of both Sox proteins to influence the activities of the <italic>Mitf</italic> and <italic>Dct</italic> promoters in luciferase reporter assays.

This agrees with previous findings that all Sox5 isoforms lack a classical transactivation domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). When reporter genes were cotransfected simultaneously with both Sox proteins, Sox10 furthermore lost its ability to efficiently activate either the <italic>Dct</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A) or the <italic>Mitf</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B).

Qualitatively similar results were also obtained in transiently transfected B16 melanoma cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C and D), although Sox10-dependent activation rates were lower, likely because of the presence of endogenous Sox10 in these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>) (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Figure10A</xref> and B). <fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>Sox5 counteracts the Sox10-dependent activation of melanocyte-specific promoters.

These studies revealed that a Sox10-specific shRNA reduced the amount of Sox10, but not of Sox5 in B16 melanoma cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>A, B, E and F), whereas a Sox5-specific shRNA reduced the Sox5, but not the Sox10 amounts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>M, N, Q and R). The Sox5-specific shRNA likewise had no influence on the Sox6 amounts in transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>A and B). Furthermore, scrambled versions of the Sox5-specific or the Sox10-specific shRNAs did not change the level of either Sox protein and served as controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>C, D, G, H, O, P, S and T). Concomitant with a reduction of endogenous Sox10 levels, there was also a dramatic reduction of Mitf amounts in &#x0003e;90% of all B16 cells transfected with a Sox10-specific shRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>I and J), thus confirming <italic>Mitf</italic> as a Sox10 target gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25 B26 B27 B28 B29">25&#x02013;29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). In contrast, &#x0003e;90% of B16 cells transfected with a Sox5-specific shRNA or the scrambled shRNA versions exhibited unaltered Mitf levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>K, L, U, V, W and X). These experiments confirm on a cellular level that on its own endogenous Sox10, but not Sox5 influences Mitf expression in melanocyte-derived cells. <fig id="F9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><p>The influence of Sox6 on melanocyte-specific gene expression in B16 melanoma cells. Immunocytochemistry was carried out on B16 melanoma cells transfected with an shRNA vector specific for Sox5 (<bold>A</bold> and <bold>B</bold>), for Sox6 (<bold>C&#x02013;J</bold>) and a combination of Sox6- and Sox10-specific shRNA vectors (<bold>K</bold> and <bold>L</bold>).

We take this as evidence that a concomitant reduction of endogenous Sox5 levels relieves the impact of decreased Sox10 amounts on <italic>Mitf</italic> expression. The fact that Mitf levels differ substantially among transfected cells is probably caused by cell-to-cell variations in the residual amounts of Sox5 and Sox10. If, for instance, Sox10 levels are lowered by shRNA below threshold levels, concomitant Sox5 reductions probably remain without effect. Nevertheless, our results are compatible with a model in which Sox5 antagonizes Sox10 target gene activation in cells of melanocytic origin.</p><p>Analogous experiments were also carried out with a Sox6-specific shRNA vector. As expected, Sox6 levels were specifically reduced by the shRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>C and D), whereas Sox5, Sox10 and Mitf levels remained unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>E&#x02013;J). Reduction of Sox6 levels, however, failed to counteract the effects of Sox10-specific shRNA on Mitf expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>K and L). This may indicate that Sox5 and Sox6 are not functionally redundant in their Sox10-modulating activity in these cells. Alternatively, both proteins are functionally redundant, but occur at substantially different amounts, with Sox6 amounts being significantly lower than Sox5 amounts in B16 melanoma.</p><p>To obtain further evidence for a Sox10-antagonizing role of Sox5, we cotransfected luciferase reporters under the control of the <italic>Dct</italic> or <italic>Mitf</italic> promoter in B16 melanoma cells with the Sox5- and Sox10-specific shRNA vectors. When luciferase activities were determined 2 days posttransfection, we observed a significantly reduced expression of both reporters in the presence of the Sox10-specific shRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Figure 10</xref>A and B). When the expression plasmids for the Sox5-specific shRNA or the scrambled control versions were cotransfected instead, activities of both <italic>Dct</italic> and <italic>Mitf</italic> promoters remained unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Figure 10</xref>A and B and data not shown). Intriguingly, simultaneous transfection of equal amounts of expression plasmids for Sox5- and Sox10-specific shRNA led to a statistically significant partial recovery of the activities of the <italic>Dct</italic> and the <italic>Mitf</italic> promoters when compared to transfections in which only the Sox10-specific shRNA was present. This argues that lowering of Sox5 amounts indeed helps to alleviate the effects of Sox10 reductions on melanocyte-specific gene expression. <fig id="F10" position="float"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><p>Sox5 binds to melanocyte-specific promoters and recruits transcriptional corepressors.

For this purpose, chromatin was prepared from B16 melanoma cells and precipitated with control antibodies or antibodies directed against Sox5 and Sox10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Figure 10</xref>C). As expected, both <italic>Dct</italic> and <italic>Mitf</italic> promoters were specifically enriched in the precipitate obtained with the Sox10-specific antibody, but not in the precipitate from control IgG reactions. Both promoters were also preferentially immunoprecipitated from chromatin when Sox5-specific antibodies were used. In contrast to the promoter region, no enrichment was observed in the immunoprecipitations for distal upstream regions of the <italic>Dct</italic> and <italic>Mitf</italic> genes or the <italic>&#x003b2;-actin</italic> promoter proving specificity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Figure 10</xref>C). Chromatin immunoprecipitation thus confirmed that Sox5 as well as Sox10 occupy the <italic>Dct</italic> and <italic>Mitf</italic> promoters in B16 melanoma cells.</p><p>Previous studies on <italic>Fgf3</italic> gene regulation in the inner ear and <italic>cyclin D1</italic> gene regulation in pancreatic &#x003b2;-cells had shown that Sox6 inhibits gene expression by recruiting the CtBP2 and HDAC1 corepressors to the respective promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>). To address whether the effects of the closely related Sox5 on melanocytic gene expression involved a similar mechanism, we first checked by chromatin immunoprecipitation whether these corepressors were also present on the <italic>Dct</italic> and <italic>Mitf</italic> promoters. Indeed, we were able to precipitate higher amounts of both promoters from B16 chromatin with anti-HDAC1 and anti-CtBP2 antisera than with control IgG, whereas no enrichment was obtained in the HDAC1- or CtBP2-specific precipitates for control fragments from the distal upstream regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Figure 10</xref>D).</p><p>Luciferase reporter assays in transiently transfected Neuro2a cells furthermore showed that HDAC1 and CtBP2 on their own had no significant effect on Sox10-dependent activation of the <italic>Mitf</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Figure 10</xref>E). Both were, however, capable of enhancing the inhibitory effects of limiting amounts of the long Sox5 isoform on Sox10-dependent promoter activation, suggesting that recruitment of these corepressors to the <italic>Mitf</italic> promoter can indeed occur via Sox5. Such a conclusion was additionally strengthened by chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments on Neuro2a cells transiently transfected with Sox5, a HA-tagged version of CtBP2 or a combination of both, as enrichment of the <italic>Mitf</italic> promoter in chromatin precipitated with an antibody against the HA tag of CtBP2 was only observed when the long Sox5 isoform was simultaneously present in the transfected cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">Figure 10</xref>F).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Here, we have shown that Sox5 is expressed in the melanocyte lineage during mouse embryonic development. This extends previous findings on the occurrence of Sox5 in early neural crest cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>) and identifies the melanocyte lineage in addition to peripheral glia as the second neural-crest-derived cell type in which Sox5 expression is maintained after the specification event. In the melanocyte lineage, Sox5 expression was restricted to melanoblasts. Sox5 was furthermore the major SoxD protein in melanoblasts where it occurred in its long isoform.</p><p>Analysis of <italic>c-Kit</italic>, <italic>Dct</italic> and <italic>Mitf</italic> as three independent markers revealed a surprisingly normal generation of melanoblasts in Sox5-deficient mice. Considering the dominance of Sox5 expression over Sox6 or Sox13 expression in melanoblasts, it appears unlikely that a melanocytic phenotype would be completely obscured in Sox5-deficient mice by other SoxD proteins, although examples of coexpression and functional redundancy exist for Sox5 and Sox6 in the development of other cell lineages such as chondrocytes and oligodendrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>). As a consequence, single mouse mutants exhibited only mild chondrocytic and oligodendrocytic phenotypes, whereas the double mutant showed severe developmental defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>).</p><p>A fairly normal generation of melanoblasts would be expected if Sox5 predominantly functioned as a modifier rather than a developmental regulator of its own. Sox5 has indeed been previously reported to modulate the function of the SoxE proteins Sox9 and Sox10. Sox5 enhances the function of Sox9 during several consecutive phases of chondrocyte development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>), but attenuates the effects of Sox9 on specification and of Sox10 on terminal differentiation during oligodendrocyte development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Sox5 also performs such a modulatory role in early development of the melanocyte lineage as indicated by the fact that the dramatically reduced generation of melanoblasts in <italic>Sox10</italic> heterozygous embryos is partially restored by additional deletion of <italic>Sox5</italic>. As already observed in the oligodendrocyte lineage, Sox5 appears to counteract the activity of Sox10.</p><p>In contrast to melanoblasts of the early mouse embryo, B16 melanoma cells not only expressed Sox5 and Sox10, but also Sox6 and Sox9. The melanoma is thus more complicated than the melanoblast. Nevertheless, our results from shRNA experiments in B16 melanoma cell cultures were fully compatible with an antagonistic effect of Sox5 on Sox10 activity.</p><p>Previous studies had failed to detect any direct protein&#x02013;protein interactions between Sox5 and Sox10 in solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). There is thus no evidence that Sox5 may function by sequestering Sox10 away from its target genes in inactive complexes. Instead, Sox5 was detected by chromatin immunoprecipitation on the same regulatory regions that have previously been shown to mediate Sox10 responsiveness to its melanocytic target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25 B26 B27 B28 B29">25&#x02013;29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32 B33 B34">32&#x02013;34</xref>). EMSA furthermore indicated that Sox5 binds to the same sequences that are Sox10 response elements. Because binding of Sox5 and Sox10 were mutually exclusive <italic>in vitro</italic>, it can be assumed that competition for binding sites may be one of the ways in which Sox5 interferes with the function of Sox10. However, it should be kept in mind that most of the Sox10-responsive promoters and enhancers contain multiple binding sites for this protein, which contribute to different extents to the overall rate of induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>). This is also the case for the melanocytic Sox10 target genes <italic>Dct</italic> and <italic>Mitf</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). Competition for binding to a particular site therefore does not exclude the possibility that both Sox5 and Sox10 are bound to different sites of the <italic>Dct</italic> or <italic>Mitf</italic> promoter at the same time. Under these conditions, it is probably essential that Sox5 recruits the HDAC1 and CtBP2 transcriptional corepressors to the promoters of melanocytic Sox10 target genes as we have shown in this study. A similar capability has previously reported for Sox6 in its role as a repressor of <italic>Fgf3</italic> gene expression in the inner ear, <italic>cyclin D1</italic> gene expression in pancreatic &#x003b2;-cells and &#x003b5;-globin expression during definitive erythropoiesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>). Corepressor recruitment may thus be a common feature of SoxD proteins.</p><p>Intriguingly, Sox5 has recently also been shown to recruit coactivators to Sox9 target genes in chondrocytes and thereby enhance Sox9 function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>). With its ability to alternatively recruit corepressors or coactivators in different developmental contexts, the ability of Sox5 to modulate the activity of SoxE proteins is clearly mechanistically complex and likely to have multiple facets.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>V.
