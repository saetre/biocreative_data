The expression pattern of nematode PQBP1 was actually unexpected, since we had expected to observe a neuron-dominant expression pattern. However it is not rare that a molecule is differentially used in different organisms even if it is highly conserved beyond species. Moreover, PQBP1 is highly conserved in Arabidopsis although the plant does not have the brain.</p><p>Our results clearly showed that nematode pqbp-1.1 is expressed in cells for lipid-storage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004104-g001">Fig. 1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004104-g002"/><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004104-g003"/><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004104-g004">4</xref>) and that pqbp-1.1 depletion links to abnormal lipid metabolism in nematode (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004104-g005">Fig. 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004104-g006">6</xref>). Mammals possess fat cells to store lipid in the body, while nematode keep lipid in intestinal cells. However, although the cell types for lipid storage are different, compositions of lipid (such as saturated or unsaturated fatty acid, triglyceride) and metabolic pathways are fundamentally conserved beyond species. In addition, the knock down experiment with shRNA showed reduction of lipid storage in mammalian white adipocyte (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004104-g007">Fig. 7</xref>). Therefore, the mutant nematodes generated in this study could be a hypothetical model for the lean body symptom of human patients linked to PQBP1 mutations. This model will be available for further analysis of the detailed molecular mechanisms underlying the lean body, and such studies might develop PQBP1 to a novel target molecule in human lipid metabolism.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Lipid metabolism in PQBP1 and polyQ pathologies</title><p>PQBP1 is known to interact with mutant Htt <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004104-Busch1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>.

However, in mammals, PQBP1 definitely functions in neurons and/or progenitor cells, and the neuronal functions are essential for understanding MR symptoms found in PQBP1-mutated patients. Here, we found that pqbp-1.1 was expressed in head ganglion cells at L1 stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004104-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>), which may correspond to neural progenitor cells in mammals. Although our preliminary observation showed no remarkable decline of locomotive activity, further analysis is needed for definite evaluation and it is essential for understanding <italic>T21D12.3</italic> function in learning and memory functions in C. elegans. Meanwhile, analysis of PQBP1 functions in neurons are now undergoing in our laboratory with Drosophila mutants and mammalian neural stem cells. Drosophila mutants show a unique type of learning impairment (unpublished observation), which is different from the long-term memory disturbance observed in transgenic fly overexpressing human PQBP1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004104-Yoshimura1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. These experiments using various animal models will promote understanding of the whole scheme of PQBP1 diseases and might lead to certain insights into basic biology in the future.</p><p>Human patients with mutations of the PQBP1 gene show mental retardation and microcephaly as major symptoms. However, PQBP1 is expressed widely in multiple tissues of mammals. Therefore, if different animal models have different advantages for analyzing multiple molecular functions of a gene, we should better take the merit. We should employ appropriate animal models for appropriate functional analyses. In this study, we took advantage of the nematode model for analyzing the phenotype in lipid metabolism. We have already constructed conditional knock out mice and RNAi-mediated knock down mice as well as fly models for analyzing neuronal functions of PQBP1, which will be reported elsewhere.</p><p>The &#x0201c;lean body&#x0201d; is not a tiny symptom because the research on this symptom might link to cell metabolism and the related disorders. Although the phenotype we observed in this study might be a downstream consequence of essential molecular functions of PQBP1, still this work shows a novel finding to suggest a possible involvement of PQBP1 in the lipid metabolism.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Plasmid construction for transgenic C. elegans expressing venus under the control of <italic>T21D12.3 enhancer/promoter</italic></title><p>An about 6.7 kb DNA fragment containing an operon of T21D12.2 (<italic>pat-6</italic>) and T21D12.3 gene was amplified from N2 genome DNA with primers <named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032;-GCCTATCAATATCAGGCACA</named-content> and <named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032;-CTTCGTCCCACCTACATAAC</named-content> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004104-g001">Fig. 1</xref>) with KOD plus (Toyobo).
