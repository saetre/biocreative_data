A truncated form of MutY (M25, residues 1&#x02013;226) retains catalytic activity; however, the C-terminal domain of MutY is required for specific binding to the 8-oxoG and is critical for mutation avoidance of oxidative damage. Using alkylation interference experiments, the determinants of the truncated and intact MutY were compared on A&#x0002f;8-oxoG-containing DNA. Several purines within the proximity of mismatched A&#x0002f;8-oxoG show differential contact by the truncated and intact MutY. Most importantly, methylation at the N7 position of the mismatched 8-oxoG and the N3 position of mismatched A interfere with intact MutY but not with M25 binding. The electrostatic contacts of MutY and M25 with the A&#x0002f;8-oxoG-containing DNA substrates are drastically different as shown by ethylation interference experiments. Five consecutive phosphate groups surrounding the 8-oxoG (one on the 3&#x02032; side and four on the 5&#x02032; side) interact with MutY but not with M25. The activities of the truncated and intact MutY are modulated differently by two minor groove-binding drugs, distamycin A and Hoechst 33258. Both distamycin A and Hoechst 33258 can inhibit, to a similar extent, the binding and glycosylase activities of MutY and M25 on A&#x0002f;G mismatch. However, binding and glycosylase activities on A&#x0002f;8-oxoG mismatch of intact MutY are inhibited to a lesser degree than those of M25. Overall, these results suggest that the C-terminal domain of MutY specifies additional contact sites on A&#x0002f;GO-containing DNA that are not found in MutY&#x02013;A&#x0002f;G and M25&#x02013;A&#x0002f;8-oxoG interactions.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> MutY protein, along with MutM and MutT, is involved in defending against the mutagenic effects of 7,8-dihydro-8-oxo-guanine (8-oxoG or GO) lesions, the most stable products known due to oxidative damage to DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd669c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd669c2">2</xref>). The short patch MutY base excision repair pathway specifically repairs A&#x0002f;GO and A&#x0002f;G to C&#x0002f;GO and C&#x000b7;G, respectively, and corrects A&#x0002f;C to G&#x022c5;C and G&#x0002f;GO to C&#x0002f;GO at a much lower rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd669c3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd669c11">11</xref>). The major function of MutY is to reduce mutation frequency caused by GO lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd669c4">4</xref>). Adenines are frequently incorporated opposite GO bases during DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd669c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd669c13">13</xref>) that subsequently leads to G&#x000b7;C to T&#x000b7;A transversions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd669c13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd669c16">16</xref>). Thus, MutY provides the defense by removing adenines misincorporated opposite GO or G following DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd669c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd669c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd669c17">17</xref>).</p><p>MutY, an adenine and a weak guanine glycosylase, is a 39&#x000a0;kDa protein with an iron&#x02013;sulfur cluster &#x0005b;4Fe&#x02013;4S&#x0005d; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd669c3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd669c11">11</xref>). The structural and functional analyses of MutY have revealed several interesting aspects. Ethylation interference studies showed that MutY interacts with at least five phosphate groups and covers ~12 bp around the A&#x0002f;G mismatch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd669c17">17</xref>). Methylation interference experiments have demonstrated that MutY specifically interacts with both mispaired A and G as well as the two bases flanking the A&#x0002f;G mismatch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd669c17">17</xref>). The MutY domain structure has been studied through proteolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd669c18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd669c20">20</xref>) and site-directed mutagenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd669c21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd669c23">23</xref>). The N-terminal domain of MutY, called cdMutY, residues 1&#x02013;226 (M25) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd669c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd669c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd669c24">24</xref>) or residues 1&#x02013;225 (p26) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd669c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd669c20">20</xref>), have been shown to retain catalytic activity. Recently, the X-ray crystal structure of a mutant of the cdMutY(D138N) with bound adenine showed that the adenine is buried in the active site of the catalytic domain and suggests that the mismatched adenine must flip out of the DNA helix for the glycosylase action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd669c22">22</xref>). In the active pocket, several amino acids (Glu37, Gln182 and Asp186) are involved in adenine binding. The N-terminal domain of MutY protein shares structural similarity with endonuclease III (endo&#x000a0;III), AlkA and human OGG1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd669c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd669c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd669c25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd669c28">28</xref>). This includes the helix&#x02013;hairpin&#x02013;helix (HhH) and Gly&#x0002f;Pro&#x02026;Asp loop motifs. Endonuclease III repairs thymine glycol and oxidized pyrimidines in DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd669c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd669c30">30</xref>), AlkA repairs methylated purines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd669c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd669c32">32</xref>), and OGG1 repairs GO and formamidopyrimidine (Fapy) when they pair with cytosine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd669c33">33</xref>). However, MutY has an additional C-terminal domain that has no counterpart in other HhH family proteins. The MutY&#x02013;DNA complex has been modeled by superimposing the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd669c22">22</xref>) onto the structure of AlkA complexed to DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd669c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd669c35">35</xref>). The model suggests that cdMutY can bind to and distort DNA in a manner similar to AlkA. The AlkA flips a 1-azaribose abasic nucleotide out of DNA and induces a 66&#x000b0; bend in the DNA with a marked widening of the minor groove (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd669c34">34</xref>).</p><p>The crystal structure of the N-terminal domain of MutY also suggests some candidate residues (Gln41, Tyr82 and Arg194) for the recognition of the base opposite the adenine. The C-terminal domain of MutY has been shown to play an important role in the recognition of GO lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd669c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd669c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd669c24">24</xref>). The truncated MutY has &#x0003e;18-fold lower binding affinities with 8-oxoG-containing mismatches than the intact MutY. MutY and M25 have similar binding affinities for an A&#x0002f;G mismatch; however, MutY has a 67-fold greater affinity to A&#x0002f;GO-containing DNA than does M25 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd669c4">4</xref>). Deletion of the C-terminal domain of MutY reduces its catalytic preference for A&#x0002f;GO-containing DNA over A&#x0002f;G-containing DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd669c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd669c24">24</xref>) and confers a mutator phenotype <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd669c4">4</xref>). Thus, repair of 8-oxoG is the major function of MutY. To further investigate the substrate recognition of MutY on A&#x0002f;GO-containing DNA and specific determinants of the C-terminal domain of MutY, methylation and ethylation interference experiments were performed to identify purine and phosphate groups on an A&#x0002f;GO-containing DNA specified by the N-terminal domain of MutY and intact MutY. Alkylation interference experiments show that the C-terminal domain of MutY contributes to the contacts with mismatched A and GO, two bases flanking the A&#x0002f;GO mismatch, and several phosphate groups 5&#x02032; to the GO. Thus, the determinants on A&#x0002f;GO-containing DNA of the C-terminal domain of MutY contribute to the 8-oxoG specificity. Our results also hint at the orientation of the C-terminal domain of MutY protein on the bound DNA substrates.</p><p>Distamycin A and Hoechst 33258 are drugs that bind to the minor groove of double-stranded DNA at the AT-rich sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd669c36">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd669c42">42</xref>). Here, we show that the activities of the truncated and intact MutY are modulated differently by these two drugs. Both distamycin A and Hoechst 33258 can inhibit, to a similar extent, the binding and glycosylase activities of MutY and M25 on A&#x0002f;G mismatches. However, binding and glycosylase activities on A&#x0002f;8-oxoG mismatches of intact MutY are less sensitive to inhibition than those of M25. The results suggest that the minor groove 5&#x02032; to the mismatched A is the target of these drugs and is involved in the DNA binding of the N-terminal domain of MutY. In conclusion, the C-terminal domain present in the intact MutY provides additional affinity to the A&#x0002f;GO mismatch and MutY activity on this mismatch is less sensitive to drug inhibition than the truncated M25.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plasmids containing MutY domains</title><p>The expression plasmid pET11a containing the entire <italic>mutY</italic> gene and the truncated <italic>mutY</italic> gene corresponding to Met1 to Gln226 (M25) have been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd669c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd669c43">43</xref>).

Dimethyl sulfate can methylate the N7 position of guanines and the N3 position of adenines. Methylation at the particular purines of DNA at the recognition sites will interfere with specific protein binding. Because M25 has much weaker binding affinity and slower glycosylase activity on A&#x0002f;GO-containing DNA than intact MutY (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd669c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd669c24">24</xref>), we expect that M25 and MutY may differentially contact A&#x0002f;GO-containing DNA. A 5&#x02032; end-labeled 40mer duplex oligonucleotide containing an A&#x0002f;GO mismatch at position 22 was used in this study to investigate the DNA contact sites of MutY and M25. There are two major problems inherent to these experiments. First, the GO base in DNA is labile to NaOH employed in the Maxam&#x02013;Gilbert A&#x0003e;G chemical sequencing reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd669c45">45</xref>). To minimize this strand cleavage, the A&#x0003e;G Maxam&#x02013;Gilbert chemical sequencing reaction was slightly modified by replacing NaOH with piperidine. Under this condition, the cleavage at GO was less extensive than the regular procedure but a high background was observed and thus only the strong interference effect could be detected. Second, the AP lyase activity of MutY renders the cleavage at the first phosphodiester bond 3&#x02032; to the mismatched adenine. To avoid this cleavage, D138N mutants of MutY and M25 were used in the experiments. The MutY(D138N) mutant has been shown to be catalytically inactive and has a similar binding affinity to A&#x0002f;GO-containing DNA as the wild-type MutY (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd669c43">43</xref>). The cdMutY(D138N) mutant is also catalytically inactive but maintains the overall structure as the wild-type domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd669c22">22</xref>).</p><p>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd669f1">1</xref> (lanes 1&#x02013;5) shows a gel image by PhosphorImager from methylation interference experiments using 40mer A&#x0002f;GO-containing DNA labeled at the 5&#x02032; end of the GO-strand with MutY(D138N) and M25(D138N). Those DNA molecules that have been methylated and have lost specific binding to the protein will be enriched in the free fraction and reduced in the bound fraction. Because of low signal to noise, the effect of methylation interference is not as pronounced. However, some interference effects were observed repeatedly in several experiments as quantitated by PhosphorImager analysis (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd669f2">2</xref>). The effect of methylation on MutY(D138N) and M25(D138N) binding is represented by white and black bars, respectively. Interference on MutY(D138N) binding was observed upon methylation of mismatched A<sub>22</sub> and G<sub>23</sub> on the A-strand and A<sub>20</sub>, A<sub>21</sub>, mismatched GO<sub>22</sub> and G<sub>24</sub> on the GO-strand (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd669f2">2</xref>). Thus, MutY interacts strongly with both mismatched bases and the two bases flanking the mispair. These residues presumably are the key determinants of MutY binding to A&#x0002f;GO-containing DNA. Since N7 groups of G<sub>23</sub> and G<sub>24</sub> are located in the major groove and N3 groups of A<sub>20</sub> and A<sub>21</sub> are located in the minor groove, MutY binds DNA in both major and minor grooves. In the stable base pair of A(<italic>anti</italic>)-GO(<italic>syn</italic>) configuration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd669c46">46</xref>), the N7 group of mismatched GO<sub>22</sub> is located in the minor groove. It appears MutY contacts A&#x0002f;GO-containing DNA in the minor groove 5&#x02032; to the mismatched A and in the major groove 3&#x02032; to the mismatched A.</p><p>In the case of M25(D138N), substantial interference could only be observed upon methylation of the G<sub>23</sub> base on the A-strand. Surprisingly, methylation at the mismatched A and GO as well as A<sub>20</sub>, A<sub>21</sub> and G<sub>24</sub> had no interference effect on binding of M25(D138N). It is suspected that some weak interactions between some of these groups and M25(D138N) may exist but their observation is hindered by a high background (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd669f1">1</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Ethylation interference</title><p>Random ethylation at the phosphate groups by ethylnitrosourea provides a tool to study the contact between proteins and DNA phosphate backbone. Because GO is more labile to NaOH than piperidine treatments, strand cleavage at the ethylated sites was carried out with piperidine. Under this condition, a high background was observed and thus only the strong interference effect could be detected. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd669f1">1</xref> (lanes 6&#x02013;10) shows a gel image by PhosphorImager from ethylation interference experiments with 40mer A&#x0002f;GO-containing DNA labeled at the 5&#x02032; end of the GO-strand with MutY(D138N) and M25(D138N). Those ethylated DNA molecules that cannot be bound specifically by the proteins will be enriched in the free fraction and reduced in the bound fraction. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd669f3">3</xref> summarizes quantitatively the results of several such experiments on both DNA strands. Ethylation interference patterns on 40mer DNA with A&#x0002f;GO mismatch suggest that MutY interacts strongly with five consecutive phosphate groups surrounding the GO, one on the 3&#x02032; side (position &#x02013;1) and four on the 5&#x02032; side (positions 0&#x02013;3) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd669f3">3</xref>, white bars). There were also weak interactions between some phosphate groups on both DNA strands. This may include the phosphates at positions 4&#x02013;6 and &#x02013;2 to &#x02013;4 on the GO-strand and at positions 2, 3 and &#x02013;2 to &#x02013;4 on the A-strand. These contribute a large amount of electrostatic interactions between MutY and phosphate groups on the GO-strand. The phosphate groups upstream of the seventh phosphodiester bond 5&#x02032; to the mismatched A may not be in contact with MutY due to different degrees of cleavage of enzyme-free and enzyme-bound DNA fractions.</p><p>When ethylation interference experiments were performed with M25(D138N), a completely different pattern was observed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd669f3">3</xref>, black bars). Contact at five phosphate groups at positions &#x02013;1 to 3 on the GO strand was diminished in M25. Surprisingly, only weak contact was observed with M25 to both strands; these probably included the phosphates at positions 2, &#x02013;2 and &#x02013;5 on the A-strand and phosphates at positions &#x02013;4, &#x02013;3 and 3&#x02013;6 on the GO strand. Due to the high background (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd669f1">1</xref>), these potential weak interactions are barely detected by our experiments.</p></sec><sec><title>Inhibition of MutY and M25 activity by DNA minor groove binding</title><p>Distamycin A and Hoechst 33258 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd669f4">4</xref>) are members of compounds that bind to the minor groove of AT-rich regions of double-stranded DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd669c36">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd669c42">42</xref>). They fit snugly within the DNA minor groove with 3&#x02013;5 AT base pairs. These drugs have been widely studied as model compounds for sequence-specific recognition of DNA. The 20mer and 40mer DNA substrates used in this study contain a sequence of AATT 5&#x02032; to the mismatched A. If MutY or M25 is in contact with the AATT region, the drugs may compete with the enzyme for binding and thus inhibit the enzyme activity.</p><p>The inhibition of DNA binding activities of MutY and M25 to A&#x0002f;G- and A&#x0002f;GO-containing DNA by distamycin A and Hoechst 33258 was examined by gel-retardation assays. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd669f5">5</xref>, both distamycin A and Hoechst 33258 inhibited the binding of MutY and M25 on A&#x0002f;G- and A&#x0002f;GO-containing DNA. The extent of inhibition by distamycin A and Hoechst 33258 is quite similar for the MutY and M25 binding with A&#x0002f;G-containing DNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd669f5">5</xref>A and C). When the concentrations of the drugs were increased from 0 to 15 &#x000b5;M, the A&#x0002f;G binding activities of MutY (7.2 nM) and M25 (14.4 nM) decreased sharply to the baseline level. The concentrations of distamycin A required to inhibit 50&#x00025; of A&#x0002f;G-binding (IC<sub>50</sub>) for MutY and M25 are 3.0 and 1.9 &#x000b5;M, respectively (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkd669tb1">1</xref>). The IC<sub>50</sub> of Hoechst 33258 inhibition on A&#x0002f;G-binding of both enzymes is 0.5 &#x000b5;M. However, the inhibition patterns were quite different for MutY and M25 when distamycin A and Hoechst 33258 were added to the binding reactions with A&#x0002f;GO-containing DNA. As with binding of MutY and M25 on A&#x0002f;G-containing DNA (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd669f5">5</xref>A and C), the A&#x0002f;GO binding activities of M25 were greatly inhibited by the drugs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd669f5">5</xref>B and D, dotted lines). The IC<sub>50</sub> values for M25 binding to A&#x0002f;GO mismatch are 2.6 and 0.9 &#x000b5;M for distamycin A and Hoechst 33258, respectively (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkd669tb1">1</xref>). In contrast, the binding activity of MutY with an A&#x0002f;GO mismatch was quite insensitive to both drugs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd669f5">5</xref>B and D, solid lines). The IC<sub>50</sub> values for MutY binding to A&#x0002f;GO mismatch are &#x0003e;30 and 26 &#x000b5;M for distamycin A and Hoechst 33258, respectively (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkd669tb1">1</xref>). It requires &#x0003e;10-fold of both drugs to achieve the same extent of inhibition on A&#x0002f;GO binding of MutY than for M25. Hoechst 33258 was more effective in inhibiting all binding activities than distamycin A.</p><p>Similar results were obtained with the inhibition of DNA glycosylase activities of MutY and M25 on A&#x0002f;G- and A&#x0002f;GO-containing DNA by distamycin A and Hoechst 33258 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd669f6">6</xref>). The IC<sub>50</sub> values of drug inhibition on cleavage activities are summarized in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkd669tb1">1</xref>. The glycosylase activity of MutY on A&#x0002f;GO mismatch was less sensitive to both drugs as compared with MutY and M25 on A&#x0002f;G mismatch and M25 on A&#x0002f;GO mismatch. It requires &#x0003e;15-fold of both drugs to achieve the same extent of inhibition on A&#x0002f;GO cleavage by MutY than for M25 and Hoechst 33258 was more effective in inhibiting all glycosylase activities than distamycin A.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The junction between the N-terminal (25 kDa) and the C-terminal (14 kDa) domains is flexible and is easily susceptible to protease digestion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd669c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd669c19">19</xref>). The N-terminal domain of MutY has catalytic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd669c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd669c18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd669c20">20</xref>) while the C-terminal domain plays an important role in GO recognition and mutation avoidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd669c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd669c18">18</xref>). The crystal structure of the catalytic domain of MutY reveals that it belongs to the HhH superfamily of DNA repair enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd669c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd669c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd669c25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd669c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd669c34">34</xref>). The C-terminal domain of MutY has no homology to other members of the HhH superfamily but shares some sequence and structure homology with MutT, which hydrolyzes 8-oxo-dGTP to 8-oxo-dGMP and pyrophosphate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd669c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd669c35">35</xref>). Among the members of this superfamily, AlkA&#x02013;DNA and hOGG1&#x02013;DNA co-crystal structures have been solved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd669c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd669c34">34</xref>). In the enzyme-bound DNA, the substrate base flips out of the DNA helix, the helix axis is sharply bent and the minor groove is widened. Although the structures of intact MutY and MutY&#x02013;DNA complex are not available, the cdMutY&#x02013;DNA model suggests that cdMutY can bind to and distort DNA in a manner similar to AlkA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd669c34">34</xref>). In this study, alkylation interference and DNA minor groove binding drugs were used to define the specific contact sites of different domains of MutY on A&#x0002f;GO-containing DNA.</p><p>The potential purine and phosphate contact sites of MutY and M25 on A&#x0002f;GO-containing DNA, as determined by alkylation interference experiments, are summarized in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd669f7">7</xref>B and C, respectively. Here, we assume that the mismatched A flips out from the DNA helix and the DNA is bent according to the DNA structure in AlkA&#x02013;DNA complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd669c34">34</xref>). Because there is no information on the MutY&#x02013;DNA structure, it is not known whether MutY and M25 can kink A&#x0002f;G- or A&#x0002f;GO-containing DNA. Nor is it known whether DNA bending can affect the alkylation interference effects. For example, base methylation may interfere protein binding because of its steric hindrance to DNA bending. MutY covers ~10 bp of the A&#x0002f;GO-containing DNA and has more contacts on the GO-strand (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd669f7">7</xref>B). MutY specifically interacts with both the mispaired A and GO as well as the two bases flanking the A&#x0002f;GO mismatch. Because the N3 groups of A<sub>20</sub> and A<sub>21</sub> on the GO-strand are located in the minor groove and the N7 groups of G<sub>23</sub> on the A-strand and G<sub>24</sub> on the GO-strand are located in the major groove, these findings suggest that MutY recognizes the minor groove 5&#x02032; to the mismatched A and the major groove 3&#x02032; to the mismatched A. It has been suggested that binding of MutY to the bases flanking the mismatches may reflect the effect of neighboring sequences on repair and cleavage efficiencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd669c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd669c47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd669c48">48</xref>). There is a considerable amount of electrostatic interaction between MutY and A&#x0002f;GO-containing DNA. At least 10 phosphate groups (the majority of which are on the GO-strand) are involved in the interactions. In light of the fact that GO may be incorporated into DNA during replication or converted from guanine by oxidation in the random DNA sequences, these backbone contacts are more important than the interactions between MutY and the purines flanking the A&#x0002f;GO mismatch.</p><p>Spatial distributions of the contacts of MutY and M25 with the distorted DNA based on the coordinates of DNA from an AlkA&#x02013;DNA co-crystal structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd669c34">34</xref>) are presented in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd669f8">8</xref>. Inspection of this model reveals several interesting features. MutY appears to interact with its DNA substrate on both sides of the double helix as well as in both the major and minor grooves. Most base determinants of MutY are accessible from one side of the helix (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd669f8">8</xref>C). The N-terminal domain of MutY contacts the widened minor groove mainly on one side of the DNA. Contacts on the other side of the helix at five consecutive phosphates (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd669f8">8</xref>A) are contributed by the C-terminal domain.</p><p>Using DNA with the same flanking sequences, we observed different patterns of contact of MutY with A&#x0002f;GO mismatch (present results) as compared to MutY with an A&#x0002f;G mismatch as reported by Lu <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd669c17">17</xref>) (compare Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd669f7">7</xref>A to B). For the base interactions, methylation at the N3 of adenine (A<sub>21</sub>) immediately 3&#x02032; to the mismatched GO strongly interferes with the MutY&#x02013;A&#x0002f;GO interactions but only slightly interferes with the MutY&#x02013;A&#x0002f;G mismatch interactions. MutY interacts weakly with G<sub>25</sub> on the G-strand and A<sub>18</sub> and A<sub>19</sub> on the A-strand of A&#x0002f;G-containing DNA but does not interact with these bases of the A&#x0002f;GO-containing DNA. It appears that MutY covers more base pairs of A&#x0002f;G-containing DNA than of A&#x0002f;GO-containing DNA. There is a substantial difference in the backbone contacts between MutY and the two substrates (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd669f7">7</xref>A and B). The ethylation patterns suggest that MutY binds to A&#x0002f;G- and A&#x0002f;GO-containing DNA in different conformations and its DNA binding sites on A&#x0002f;GO-containing DNA are shifted toward the 5&#x02032; side of GO as compared to A&#x0002f;G-containing DNA. Thus, a large component of the tight binding of MutY to the A&#x0002f;GO mismatch involves electrostatic binding energy. These base and phosphate contacts may account for the 80-fold higher MutY binding with A&#x0002f;GO-containing DNA than with A&#x0002f;G-containing DNA reported by Lu <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd669c17">17</xref>). However, a direct comparison of the present results to the data obtained by Lu <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd669c17">17</xref>) may be difficult to make because some parameters are different in these two experiments. The present results are derived from the D138N mutant of MutY using a modified Maxam&#x02013;Gilbert A&#x0003e;G chemical sequencing reaction by replacing NaOH with piperidine. The catalytically inactive D138N mutant of MutY was used in the present experiments to eliminate the cleavage at the phosphodiester bond at the 3&#x02032; of mismatched A while wild-type MutY in the presence of methoxyamine was used by Lu <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd669c17">17</xref>). Because it has been shown that the D138N mutation does not alter the overall structure of cdMutY (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd669c22">22</xref>) and does not change the DNA binding affinity of MutY (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd669c43">43</xref>), the D138N mutant of MutY may contact DNA in a manner similar to wild-type MutY. Replacing NaOH with piperidine can reduce the cleavage at GO but may increase the background levels and thus only the strong interference effects could be detected here.</p><p>We also demonstrated that by removing the C-terminal domain of MutY, it loses most of the electrostatic interactions with the DNA backbone and the tight contacts with several purine groups flanking the A&#x0002f;GO mismatch (compare Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd669f7">7</xref>B to C). This can partially explain why A&#x0002f;GO binding activity of M25 is ~70-fold lower than MutY (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd669c4">4</xref>) and the A&#x0002f;GO glycosylase activity is much faster for MutY than for M25 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd669c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd669c24">24</xref>). As determined by the methylation interference experiments, the C-terminal domain of MutY influences the contact with mismatched A and GO as well as A<sub>20</sub>, A<sub>21</sub> and G<sub>24</sub> on the A-strand. We do not expect that methylation of mismatched A interferes with MutY binding but does not interfere with M25 binding. This result does not seem to be consistent with the data derived from the X-ray crystal structure of cdMutY with bound adenine in that the flipped-out adenine is buried in the active site of the catalytic domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd669c22">22</xref>). We suggest that the adenine-binding pocket may be large enough to bind the methylated adenine or this pocket may have some conformational change in the intact MutY as compared with M25. It is interesting to note that MutY has high binding affinities to A&#x0002f;GO, G&#x0002f;GO, T&#x0002f;GO and AP&#x0002f;GO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd669c4">4</xref>). Thus, the high affinity to GO specified by the C-terminal domain of MutY may relax the base opposite to GO. Removing the C-terminal domain also alters the ethylation interference pattern. Interestingly, contacts at five consecutive phosphate groups (positions &#x02013;1 to 3) on the GO-strand by MutY were diminished in the M25&#x02013;A&#x0002f;GO interaction. These results suggest that the C-terminal domain of MutY may contact DNA directly or that the presence of the C-terminal domain may cause structural changes in the rest of the protein that enhance protein&#x02013;DNA contacts in the N-terminal region.</p><p>The competition experiments of the DNA minor groove binding drugs show that distamycin A and Hoechst 33258 can bind the AATT sequence immediately 5&#x02032; to the mismatched A and affect both binding and cleavage activities of MutY. The inhibition is particularly pronounced for MutY&#x02013;A&#x0002f;G, M25&#x02013;A&#x0002f;G and M25&#x02013;&#x02013;A&#x0002f;GO interactions. In contrast, the binding and cleavage activities of MutY with A&#x0002f;GO mismatch were quite insensitive to both drugs. The data suggest that the N-terminal domain of MutY makes some contacts in the minor groove of DNA at the 5&#x02032; of the mismatched A. This result is consistent with the X-ray crystal structure of cdMutY that shows the &#x003b1;2&#x02013;&#x003b1;3 motif is in the DNA minor groove 5&#x02032; of the mismatched A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd669c22">22</xref>). However, the methylation interference data indicate the N3 groups of two adenines 3&#x02032; to the mismatched GO are not involved in M25&#x02013;A&#x0002f;GO interaction. As for MutY, the extra contacts on A&#x0002f;GO-containing DNA derived from the C-terminal domain of MutY minimize the inhibition of distamycin A and Hoechst 33258 on the binding and nicking activities of intact MutY. Based on the alkylation interference results, the C-terminal domain may affect the binding to N3 groups of A<sub>23</sub> and A<sub>24</sub> in the minor groove; however, the majority of the determinants are on the backbone phosphates (compare Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd669f8">8</xref>C and D). Although the two drugs compete with MutY for the minor groove binding sites, not all of the contact sites of MutY are totally blocked.</p><p>The co-crystal structures of <italic>E.coli</italic> AlkA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd669c34">34</xref>) and human OGG1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd669c28">28</xref>) complexed with DNA show that these HhH proteins interact with the minor groove of DNA. Modeling studies also suggest that other HhH glycosylases including MutY can bind to DNA in a similar manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd669c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd669c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd669c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd669c49">49</xref>). These models suggest that cdMutY recognizes its DNA substrate through the DNA minor groove and the HhH motif interacts closely with phosphates at positions &#x02013;2 and &#x02013;3 on the A-strand (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd669f7">7</xref>). The Gln42 of MutY is in the proper position to bend the DNA and assist in base flipping. Molecular modeling also suggests that the orientation of the A-strand from 5&#x02032; to 3&#x02032; is arranged from the &#x0005b;4Fe&#x02013;4S&#x0005d; domain to the HhH domain, and places the &#x003b1;2&#x02013;&#x003b1;3 motif in the DNA minor groove 5&#x02032; of the mismatched A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd669c22">22</xref>). The crystal structure of the cdMutY also suggests some candidate residues (Gln41, Tyr82 and Arg194) for the recognition of the base opposite the adenine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd669c22">22</xref>). AlkA and OGG1 contact their DNA substrates mainly through interaction on the flipped-out strand. However, MutY has more base and phosphate contacts on the GO-strand. These major determinants of the mismatched GO and electrostatic interactions are dependent on the C-terminal domain of MutY. We have proposed that the DNA is embedded between the catalytic and C-terminal domains of MutY (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd669c4">4</xref>). In this model, the C-terminal domain functions like a clamp to hold the GO-containing strand and the clamp is tighter with an A&#x0002f;GO-containing DNA than with an A&#x0002f;G-containing DNA. Our data presented here support this clamp model and specifically point out the orientation of the C-terminal domain on an A&#x0002f;GO substrate.</p><p>Volk <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd669c35">35</xref>) have attempted to model a MutY&#x02013;DNA structure based on the X-ray structure of cdMutY (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd669c22">22</xref>), the coordinates of DNA from AlkA co-crystal structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd669c34">34</xref>) and a model for the C-terminal domain based upon the preliminary NMR data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd669c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd669c50">50</xref>) and the solution structure of MutT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd669c51">51</xref>). Their model is based on the assumption that the structure of the cdMutY remains the same as in the intact MutY and is similar to our clamp model. However, our data do not fully support their model regarding the orientation of the C-terminal domain. In order to contact the five phosphates at positions &#x02013;1 to 3 on the GO-strand, the C-terminal domain has to be positioned on the opposite side of the HhH motif (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd669f8">8</xref>). Based on the perspective depicted in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd669f8">8</xref>A, the mismatched adenine (labeled A) flips out into the adenine-binding pocket between the HhH and Fe&#x02013;S domains with the HhH domain lying above and the Fe&#x02013;S domain lying below the plane of DNA. The HhH motif binds to the two phosphate groups on the left (marked by arrows). The C-terminal domain begins just after the Fe&#x02013;S domain near the lower right of the figure and extends from the back of the DNA near the center of the figure to the front of DNA to cover the five phosphate groups (in red) on the GO-strand. In this orientation, the C-terminal domain tilts to some degree toward the HhH motif. In Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd669f8">8</xref>C, the DNA is rotated 180&#x000b0; from that in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd669f8">8</xref>A and the cdMutY is located at the top of the figure above the DNA. In this view, the C-terminal domain is on the front of the DNA and wraps around the DNA through the major groove near the center of the figure to reach the five phosphate groups (in red) on the GO-strand. Our results will facilitate the modeling of the MutY&#x02013;DNA structure when the MutY structure or both domains of MutY become available, but the most convincing evidence requires the solution of the MutY&#x02013;DNA co-crystal structure.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkd669f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> A representative gel image by PhosphorImager of the alkylation interference of MutY and M25.

After binding, bound (B) and free (F) DNA were separated by 4&#x00025; native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, eluted and chemically cleaved (32). Control samples were DNA treated by the same procedures without adding protein. Cleavage products were then analyzed on a 14&#x00025; DNA sequencing gel and exposed to a PhosphorImager screen.
