Incomplete erasure at genes associated with a measurable phenotype results in unusual patterns of inheritance from one generation to the next, termed transgenerational epigenetic inheritance. The <italic>Agouti viable yellow (A<sup>vy</sup>)</italic> allele is the best-studied example of this phenomenon in mice. The <italic>A<sup>vy</sup></italic> allele is the result of a retrotransposon insertion upstream of the <italic>Agouti</italic> gene. Expression at this locus is controlled by the long terminal repeat (LTR) of the retrotransposon, and expression results in a yellow coat and correlates with hypomethylation of the LTR. Isogenic mice display variable expressivity, resulting in mice with a range of coat colours, from yellow through to agouti. Agouti mice have a methylated LTR. The locus displays epigenetic inheritance following maternal but not paternal transmission; yellow mothers produce more yellow offspring than agouti mothers. We have analysed the DNA methylation in mature gametes, zygotes, and blastocysts and found that the paternally and maternally inherited alleles are treated differently. The paternally inherited allele is demethylated rapidly, and the maternal allele is demethylated more slowly, in a manner similar to that of nonimprinted single-copy genes. Interestingly, following maternal transmission of the allele, there is no DNA methylation in the blastocyst, suggesting that DNA methylation is not the inherited mark. We have independent support for this conclusion from studies that do not involve direct analysis of DNA methylation. Haplo-insufficiency for Mel18, a polycomb group protein, introduces epigenetic inheritance at a paternally derived <italic>A<sup>vy</sup></italic> allele, and the pedigrees reveal that this occurs after zygotic genome activation and, therefore, despite the rapid demethylation of the locus.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="synopsis"><title>Synopsis</title><p>There is now a reasonable amount of evidence from both epidemiological studies in humans and from genetic studies in animals and plants that information in addition to the primary DNA sequence is inherited across generations and can influence the phenotype of the offspring. Researchers refer to this information as epigenetic, and there is much interest in discovering the molecular basis for this epigenetic information. They now know a great deal about the various types of epigenetic marks that regulate the expression of the genome within the life of an organism, and these include both modifications to the DNA molecule itself, specifically DNA methylation and modifications to the proteins that package the DNA into chromosomes, termed chromatin. DNA methylation appears to be one of the most stable epigenetic modifications and has been the primary candidate for the molecule responsible for transgenerational epigenetic inheritance. The results presented here suggest that DNA methylation is not the inherited epigenetic mark, at least in the mouse model used in this study.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="7"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>Citation:</meta-name><meta-value>Blewitt ME, Vickaryous NK, Paldi A, Koseki H, Whitelaw E (2006) Dynamic reprogramming of DNA methylation at an epigenetically sensitive allele in mice.

The molecular nature of the epigenetic mark that is inherited is not known. Non-Mendelian inheritance, such as this, is of particular interest if it exists in humans, since it would have a profound effect on the inheritance of phenotypic traits.</p><p>Arguably the best characterised instance of transgenerational epigenetic inheritance in mammals occurs following female transmission of the <italic>Agouti viable yellow (A<sup>vy</sup>)</italic> allele in mice &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020049-b003">3</xref>&#x0005d;. Expression of the <italic>A<sup>vy</sup></italic> allele is controlled by an intracisternal A particle (IAP), inserted into pseudoexon 1a of the <italic>Agouti</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020049-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). A cryptic promoter within the 3&#x02032; long terminal repeat (LTR) of the IAP directs transcription of the <italic>Agouti</italic> coding exons. The activity of the <italic>A<sup>vy</sup></italic> allele is variable among isogenic littermates and correlates with epigenetic state; the silent allele is hypermethylated and produces a wild-type agouti-coloured coat (termed pseudoagouti), while the active allele is hypomethylated and produces a completely yellow coat &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020049-b003">3</xref>&#x0005d;. The activity of the allele can differ between cells, termed variegation, producing a mottled mouse, with patches of yellow and patches of pseudoagouti fur. The locus displays epigenetic inheritance following maternal transmission; yellow mothers produce more yellow offspring than pseudoagouti mothers. Interestingly, the <italic>A<sup>vy</sup></italic> allele does not display epigenetic inheritance following paternal transmission: yellow and pseudoagouti <italic>A<sup>vy</sup>/a</italic> sires produce the same proportion of phenotypes in their offspring. Why epigenetic inheritance occurs following maternal, but not paternal, transmission of the allele is not understood, but we have evidence that this is a strain background effect since transgenerational epigenetic inheritance does occur following paternal transmission of the <named-content content-type="genus-species">Axin fused</named-content> allele in the 129 background &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020049-b004">4</xref>&#x0005d;. Our hypothesis is that transgenerational epigenetic inheritance is the result of a failure to clear epigenetic marks.</p><p>It has been reported that IAPs in general appear to be resistant to epigenetic reprogramming &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020049-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d;. We were interested in learning more about both the molecular nature of this epigenetic inheritance and the stage, during gametogenesis and early embryonic development, at which the epigenetic state is reprogrammed. To this end, we have analysed the DNA methylation state of the <italic>A<sup>vy</sup></italic> allele in gametes, zygotes, and blastocysts, following both paternal and maternal transmission. This is the first report of bisulfite sequencing analysis on a nonimprinted allele, followed separately through maternal and paternal inheritance. We found that DNA methylation at the LTR of the IAP at the <italic>A<sup>vy</sup></italic> allele is reprogrammed in early development in a similar way to the maternal and paternal genomes in general. Furthermore, we found a complete clearing of DNA methylation following maternal transmission, which argues against DNA methylation being the meiotically inherited epigenetic mark. In addition, we provide independent evidence from genetic studies, using a polycomb group knockout mouse, to support this conclusion.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>A Paternally Derived <italic>A<sup>vy</sup></italic> Allele Is Subject to Rapid Demethylation Immediately Postfertilisation</title><p>The DNA methylation state at the <italic>A<sup>vy</sup></italic> allele in sperm of yellow and pseudoagouti males was determined by Southern transfer and by bisulfite sequencing. Tail and sperm DNA from yellow and pseudoagouti males were digested with BamHI, followed by MspI or HpaII. MspI and HpaII are isoschizomers that recognise the sequence CCGG. HpaII does not cut when the internal cytosine is methylated, whereas MspI cuts irrespective of methylation at this internal cytosine residue. The samples were analysed by Southern transfer, using the <italic>agouti</italic> probe (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020049-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). Each mouse carries both the <italic>A<sup>vy</sup></italic> and <italic>a</italic> alleles. The <italic>a</italic> allele is a null allele found in the C57BL/6 background. Following BamHI digestion, the <italic>agouti</italic> probe detects a 9-kb and 3.3-kb band from the <italic>A<sup>vy</sup></italic> and <italic>a</italic> alleles, respectively &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020049-b003">3</xref>&#x0005d;. As previously shown &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020049-b003">3</xref>&#x0005d;, the 9-kb BamHI band, representing the <italic>A<sup>vy</sup></italic> allele, is reduced in size following HpaII digestion of DNA from the tails of yellow mice, whereas a significant amount of the band remains uncut in the DNA from the tails of pseudoagouti mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020049-g001">Figure 1</xref>B, upper panel; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020049-sg001">Figure S1</xref>), indicating a higher degree of methylation in tail tissue of a pseudoagouti animal. Similarly, the sperm of yellow mice are less methylated than those of pseudoagouti mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020049-g001">Figure 1</xref>B and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020049-sg001">Figure S1</xref>). This result confirms our bisulfite sequencing analysis of sperm DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020049-g002">Figure 2</xref>A&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020049-g002">2</xref>C), which has been published previously &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020049-b004">4</xref>&#x0005d;. The <italic>A<sup>vy</sup></italic> allele has an average of 73&#x00025; methylation in sperm of pseudoagouti males, compared with 34&#x00025; in the sperm of yellow males. In this genetic background (C57BL/6), the range of phenotypes of the offspring of yellow and pseudoagouti males is the same &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020049-b003">3</xref>&#x0005d;. So the methylation of the <italic>A<sup>vy</sup></italic> allele in sperm reflects the phenotype of the father, rather than the range of phenotypes seen in his offspring. Therefore, at the paternally inherited allele, it appears that the epigenetic mark must be cleared and reestablished after fertilisation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020049-b004">4</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>We went on to perform bisulfite sequencing on zygotes, two-cell embryos, and blastocysts produced from pseudoagouti <italic>A<sup>vy</sup>/a</italic> sires (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020049-g002">Figure 2</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020049-g002">2</xref>C). We used a rigorous method to avoid clonal bias: within one single bisulfite conversion, clones were only included in the dataset if they could be distinguished as different by either CpG or non-CpG methylation. The bisulfite conversions were carried out on multiple separate occasions for each time point. The zygotes show a dramatic and highly significant (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001, one-tailed t-test, equal variance) decrease in methylation from the level seen in mature sperm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020049-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). We analysed zygotes 21&#x02013;23 h after the administration of human chorionic gonadotrophin, corresponding to 9&#x02013;11 h postfertilisation. DNA replication is not complete until 12 to 14 h postfertilisation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020049-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020049-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d;. Therefore the drop from 73&#x00025; to 15&#x00025; methylation that occurred in less than 11 h, and before the first cell division, is likely to be due to active demethylation. In this respect, the <italic>A<sup>vy</sup></italic> allele is behaving like the paternal genome in general &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020049-b008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020049-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;, rather than like the IAPs in general &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020049-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d;. The IAP at <italic>A<sup>vy</sup></italic> is unusual since it can be active, unlike the vast majority of IAP LTRs, which remain heavily methylated and presumably transcriptionally inactive.</p><p>The level of methylation remained low in the two-cell embryos and blastocysts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020049-g002">Figure 2</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020049-g002">2</xref>C). The blastocysts from yellow and pseudoagouti sires had equivalent levels of methylation, in contrast to the significant difference in methylation in the sperm of these males. This suggests that the clearing of methylation marks on the paternally derived allele is basically complete in the zygote. The level of methylation in blastocysts appears to be much lower than that of somatic tissue, so presumably resetting has not yet occurred.</p><p>By 12.5 days postcoitum (dpc), a full range of methylation states are observed in embryos produced from <italic>A<sup>vy</sup>/a</italic> sires (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020049-g003">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020049-sg002">Figure S2</xref>): E1 and E4 are hypomethylated, E2 is hypermethylated, and E3 is moderately methylated, as indicated by the variable amount of the 9-kb BamHI band remaining after HpaII digestion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020049-g003">Figure 3</xref>). These methylation states are similar to those seen in somatic tissue of yellow, pseudoagouti, and mottled adults (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020049-g001">Figure 1</xref>B and &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020049-b003">3</xref>&#x0005d;). This has been confirmed by bisulfite sequencing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020049-sg002">Figure S2</xref>). A similar result is seen at 10.5 dpc (unpublished data). Therefore, at the paternally inherited <italic>A<sup>vy</sup></italic> allele, it appears that the epigenetic mark is actively cleared immediately postfertilisation and reestablished in a stochastic manner before midgestation. Resetting of the epigenetic marks at the locus is likely to occur at approximately the same stage as X inactivation (6.5 dpc) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020049-b010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020049-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;; however, given the time points we have analysed, our data only allow us to place the reestablishment of the epigenetic marks between implantation and midgestation.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>A Maternally Inherited <italic>A<sup>vy</sup></italic> Allele Is Not Subject to Rapid Demethylation, but Is Completely Demethylated before Implantation</title><p>We performed bisulfite sequencing on unfertilised oocytes from yellow and pseudoagouti females, and zygotes and blastocysts from pseudoagouti females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020049-g004">Figure 4</xref>). As expected, the allele was more heavily methylated in oocytes of pseudoagouti females than in those of yellow females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020049-g004">Figure 4</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020049-g004">4</xref>D). Moreover, the level of methylation in the zygotes of pseudoagouti females was similar to that found in the unfertilised oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020049-g004">Figure 4</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020049-g004">4</xref>B). There is no rapid demethylation of the maternally transmitted <italic>A<sup>vy</sup></italic> allele in the zygote. This raises the possibility that the absence of rapid demethylation of the maternally transmitted allele contributes to the transgenerational epigenetic inheritance. However, blastocysts from pseudoagouti dams did not show any methylation at the allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020049-g004">Figure 4</xref>C). Pseudoagouti dams produce 20&#x00025; pseudoagouti offspring, whereas yellow dams do not produce any &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020049-b003">3</xref>&#x0005d;. These results suggest that DNA methylation is not the inherited mark at the <italic>A<sup>vy</sup></italic> allele, as it is inconsistent with the requirement for incomplete erasure following transmission of the allele from a pseudoagouti dam.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Transgenerational Epigenetic Inheritance at the <italic>A<sup>vy</sup></italic> Allele Is Seen following Paternal Transmission in Offspring That Are Haplo-Insufficient for Mel18</title><p>We wished to find independent evidence that DNA methylation may not be the inherited mark at the <italic>A<sup>vy</sup></italic> allele.

Consistent with this previous finding, we observe epigenetic inheritance in the mice haplo-insufficient for Mel18, but not in their wild-type littermates. The cytoplasmic environment of oocytes is established before the segregation of the diploid set of chromosomes. Therefore, the fact that this effect is not seen in the wild-type littermates argues that it is dependent on activation of the zygotic genome and, hence, events after zygotic genome activation at the two-cell stage &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020049-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;.

To enable a clearer interpretation of all the current studies, we need to understand the molecular basis of the epigenetic reprogramming at the <italic>A<sup>vy</sup></italic> allele.</p><p>We have found that DNA methylation at the <italic>A<sup>vy</sup></italic> allele is not reprogrammed during primordial germ cell development. However, during preimplantation development, the paternal allele is rapidly demethylated immediately following fertilisation, whereas the maternal allele is not.

These results are in contrast to the behaviour of the majority of IAPs, which are largely resistant to reprogramming &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020049-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d;, but are consistent with the behaviour of maternal and paternal genomes in general &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020049-b008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020049-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;. Epigenetic inheritance at this locus in this genetic background occurs following maternal transmission of the <italic>A<sup>vy</sup></italic> allele. If this were the result of incomplete clearing of DNA methylation at the allele, then there would be a requirement for some DNA methylation to remain on the maternally transmitted allele at the blastocyst stage, which we do not see. These results suggest that DNA methylation is not the inherited epigenetic mark.</p><p>We have presented independent evidence for this conclusion. We found that following paternal transmission of the <italic>A<sup>vy</sup></italic> allele, and maternal transmission of the <italic>Mel18</italic> knockout allele, mice haplo-insufficient for Mel18 displayed epigenetic inheritance, whereas their wild-type littermates did not. This implicates events after zygotic genome activation, and therefore after the complete demethylation of the <italic>A<sup>vy</sup></italic> allele, supporting our conclusion that DNA methylation does not appear to be the inherited epigenetic mark at this allele. It is interesting that in a <italic>Mel18</italic> haplo-insufficient background, there is transgenerational epigenetic inheritance, whereas in a <italic>Mel18</italic> wild-type background this is not the case. Presumably, some underlying epigenetic mark at <italic>A<sup>vy</sup></italic> is cleared in <italic>Mel18</italic> wild-type embryos but not fully cleared in <italic>Mel18</italic> haplo-insufficient embryos. However, the role played by <italic>Mel18</italic> in the clearing of this mark is not fully understood. Normally, Mel18 is part of polycomb repressive complex 1, which performs histone H2A ubiquitination, interacts with histone methyltransferases, histones, and chromatin remodelling complexes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020049-b020">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020049-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;. Polycomb complexes are dynamic in their composition &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020049-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d;, and reducing the level of Mel18 may have altered the makeup of PRC1, in turn affecting epigenetic reprogramming.</p><p>It has been known for some time that epigenetic marks can be inherited during meiosis in fission yeast, which do not methylate their DNA at all &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020049-b024">24</xref>&#x0005d;. Furthermore, in a study of the inheritance of DNA methylation patterns in humans, Silva and White found that although the level of DNA methylation was heritable in families, the methylation patterns were not identical across generations or between tissues &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020049-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d;. They concluded that DNA methylation was a secondary mark, rather than the primary inherited epigenetic mark.</p><p>If DNA methylation is not the heritable mark that produces transgenerational epigenetic inheritance, it seems likely that specific histone modifications play a role. In this regard, it is interesting that histone H4 lysine 20 trimethylation has been reported in embryonic stem cells as the major histone methylation mark of IAP LTRs &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020049-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d;. Alternatively, there may be an RNA-based mechanism that accounts for the inheritance. Unfortunately, no methods are currently available to study either chromatin state at a specific locus or small RNA molecules with sufficient sensitivity to analyse these marks at the <italic>A<sup>vy</sup></italic> allele during the very early stages of development.</p><p>Epigenetic inheritance is a controversial phenomenon, which fundamentally changes the way that we interpret inheritance of phenotypic traits. Although it is not yet clear whether it occurs in humans, epigenetic inheritance has now been reported to occur at a number of alleles in mice &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020049-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;, providing a tractable system in which to study this event. We have found that at the <italic>A<sup>vy</sup></italic> allele, DNA methylation is unlikely to be the epigenetic mark that is inherited from one generation to the next.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme digestion and Southern transfer.</title><p>DNA was prepared from tail, sperm, or embryo and digested and subjected to Southern transfer as previously described &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020049-b003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020049-b004">4</xref>&#x0005d;.

After bisulfite conversion, each agarose block was resuspended in 10 &#x003bc;L of water, and 5 &#x003bc;L was used in the primary PCR. An agarose-only control was always included, and the experiment was only used if the agarose control was negative at the end of the seminested PCR. PCR fragments were subcloned into pGEM-T Easy (Promega, Madison, Wisconsin, United States). Clones were only accepted if they differed in CpG methylation, or non-CpG methylation. Any clones with greater than 5&#x00025; non-CpG methylation were excluded from the dataset, although these made up less than 5&#x00025; of all clones sequenced. These clones tended to have very high levels of non-CpG methylation, an indication of incomplete bisulfite conversion. For the early embryos, in general, only one clone was included per sample, since they were largely unmethylated, meaning our calculation of methylation is likely be an overestimate and is therefore a conservative estimate of demethylation.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Genotyping Mel18 knockout mice.</title><p>Tail DNA was prepared as previously described &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020049-b003">3</xref>&#x0005d;.

inserted into pseudoexon 1a (grey box). A cryptic promoter within the 3&#x02032; LTR of the IAP (black arrows) directs transcription of the <italic>agouti</italic> coding exons. The BamHI (B) and MspI (M) sites are shown in the region of the unique 400-bp probe B. Tail and mature sperm from a yellow and a pseudoagouti male were collected. DNA was prepared and samples digested with BamHI followed by MspI or its isoschizomer HpaII, transferred and hybridised with the <italic>agouti</italic> probe &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020049-b003">3</xref>&#x0005d;. The <italic>A<sup>vy</sup></italic> allele produces a 9-kb BamHI band, while the <italic>a</italic> allele produces a 3.3-kb band. Membranes were stripped and rehybridised with a murine <italic>&#x003b1;-globin</italic> probe to check for equal digestion within the tissue samples (shown in &#x0005b;B&#x0005d;). These results represent experiments performed on sperm and tail DNA from seven yellow and five pseudoagouti males, a further one of each are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020049-sg001">Figure S1</xref>. Mature sperm were isolated from both epididymes of the male (each sample contained in the order of 10<sup>6</sup> to 10<sup>7</sup> spermatocytes). Sperm samples were checked by light microscopy and found to be greater than 95&#x00025; spermatocytes. The methylation state of the tissues is indicated by the ratio of the 9-kb BamHI band to the 7-kb band remaining after HpaII digestion. The 9-kb band is marked by an asterisk. The methylation state of the sperm reflects the phenotype of the father rather than the range of phenotypes seen in the offspring.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pgen.0020049.g001"/></fig><fig id="pgen-0020049-g002" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Methylation of the <italic>A<sup>vy</sup></italic> Allele following Paternal Transmission</title><p>The methylation status of each CpG dinucleotide was determined by sequencing PCR clones of bisulfite-converted DNA &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020049-b004">4</xref>&#x0005d;.
