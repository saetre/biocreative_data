The comprehension of the basal role of the synapsin family is hampered in vertebrates by the existence of multiple synapsin genes. Therefore, studying homologous genes in basal chordates, devoid of genome duplication, could help to achieve a better understanding of the complex functions of these proteins.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In this study we report the cloning and characterization of the <italic>Ciona intestinalis </italic>and amphioxus <italic>Branchiostoma floridae </italic>synapsin transcripts and the definition of their gene structure using available <italic>C. intestinalis </italic>and <italic>B. floridae </italic>genomic sequences. We demonstrate the occurrence, in both model organisms, of a single member of the synapsin gene family. Full-length synapsin genes were identified in the recently sequenced genomes of phylogenetically diverse metazoans. Comparative genome analysis reveals extensive conservation of the SYN locus in several metazoans.

Moreover, we hypothesize that, during the evolution of synapsin proteins, new domains are added at different stages probably to cope up with the increased complexity in the nervous system organization. Finally, we demonstrate that protochordate synapsin is restricted to the post-mitotic phase of CNS development and thereby is a good marker of postmitotic neurons.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Synapsins are neuronal phosphoproteins that constitute a small family of synaptic molecules specifically associated with synaptic vesicles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Synapsins regulate the balance between the readily-releasable pool and the reserve pool of synaptic vesicles and are involved in the neurotransmitter release and synaptic plasticity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>In vertebrates, synapsins are encoded by three distinct genes (<italic>syn1-syn3</italic>) that give rise to ten distinct alternative transcripts (<italic>synIa/b, synIIa/b, synIIIa-f) </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Invertebrate and vertebrate synapsin transcripts share similarity among three conserved domains known as A, C and E domains. In particular, the N-terminal region shows a stretch of homology in the A-domain containing the unique phosphorylation site for cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase I/IV (CaMK I/IV) common to all the synapsins, although the most extensive homology is found within the C-domain in a large region that represents the core of the synapsin transcript. A third conserved domain is located at the COOH-terminus (E domain) and it is shared by the a-type isoforms of synapsin I, II and III. In the last decades, a number of new functions have been proposed for synapsin family proteins, in addition to the classical role in neurotransmitter release. An involvement in maintaining vesicle integrity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and in regulating the proportion of functional vesicles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] has been hypothesized.</p><p>Synapsins also modulate neuronal development such as establishment of neuronal polarity, neurite elongation and synapse formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. In mammals, the three synapsin genes show a distinct temporal pattern of expression in neurons: synapsin III is expressed early during neuronal development and its expression is downregulated in mature neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], whilst the product of the other two synapsin genes are upregulated at the onset of synaptogenesis and remain elevated in mature neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>Urochordates (i.e. ascidians and other tunicates) and cephalochordates (amphioxus) are chordate groups basal to vertebrates, with urochordates being the closest relatives to vertebrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Ascidian and amphioxus larvae posses simple central and peripheral nervous systems that reproduce well the basic organization of chordate nervous system and are therefore good models to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the chordate nervous system development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In fact, in spite of the few neurons that constitute their nervous systems, a number of molecular studies have pointed out the expression, in both ascidian and amphioxus, of at least one member for virtually all the gene families identified in vertebrate development. Thus, synapsin genes, which are preferentially expressed in neurons, are useful markers for the investigation of neuron-specific gene expression.</p><p>In this study we have analyzed synapsin homologues in the ascidian <italic>C. intestinalis </italic>and amphioxus <italic>B. floridae</italic>, from a genomic and a developmental point of view. We demonstrate the occurrence, in both model organisms, of a single member of the synapsin family, and the presence of an alternative transcript exclusively in amphioxus. Furthermore, we have carried out a comprehensive comparative analysis of the exon-intron structure of the synapsin gene locus in humans and several metazoan phyla, and demonstrated a high level of conservation of its genomic organization. Such analysis was also extended to the proteins to reconstruct the domain evolution of synapsin along several metazoans. We conclude that protochordate synapsin is a neuronal-specific marker, which is expressed in several cell types of PNS (epidermal sensory neurons) and in many, if not all, CNS neurons during the final embryonic differentiation stages and in the fully developed embryonic nervous system.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>A single synapsin gene is present in basal chordates and in the sister-group of the bilaterian metazoans</title><p>The amphioxus <italic>B. floridae </italic>and the ascidian <italic>C. intestinalis </italic>genomes contain a single synapsin gene (<italic>AmphiSyn </italic>and <italic>Ci-Syn</italic>) that shows a high degree of sequence conservation with vertebrate synapsins. The full length <italic>Ci-Syn </italic>cDNA was 1682 bp long and contained a protein-coding region of 1560 bp. The <italic>Ci-Syn </italic>cDNA translates into a polypeptide of 519 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 58 kDa. The exon/intron organization of the gene encoding <italic>Ci-Syn </italic>was deduced by comparing its cDNA sequence with the genomic sequences of scaffold 53 (release version 1.0) and chromosome 5 (release version 2.0) (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). The exonic sequences in the genomic database and the corresponding regions of the transcript were 98% identical. <italic>Ciona </italic><italic>Ci-Syn </italic>ORF was encoded in ~24 kb of genomic DNA in both scaffolds, and distributed in 10 exons with sizes between 58 and 271 bp (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Genomic organization of the synapsin locus in human and several invertebrate species</bold>. The conservation of nested gene organization was really high when different species were compared. In all examined species, the TIMP gene is nested within the intron of Syn gene in reverse orientation, with the exception of <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>. <italic>Ciona intestinalis </italic>and <italic>Strongylocentrotus purpuratus </italic>are characterized by a peculiar nested organization of SYN-TIMP locus because more than one TIMP sequence was found (two TIMP in <italic>C. intestinalis </italic>and ten TIMP in <italic>S. purpuratus</italic>). Alternative transcripts generating by use of different exons are shown for <italic>Homo sapiens </italic>(isoforms a and b of <italic>SYNI</italic>, <italic>II</italic>; isoforms a-f of <italic>SYNIII</italic>), <italic>Branchiostoma floridae </italic>(long and short isoforms), <italic>Drosophila melanogaster </italic>(isoforms a, c and e), <italic>C. elegans </italic>(isoforms a and b).

However, PCR assay on amphioxus embryonic cDNA library yielded two synapsin isoforms generated by alternative splicing of the same gene. These two cDNAs result in a long protein, termed AmphiSyn-long and a short truncated protein termed AmphiSyn-short, respectively of 474 and 447 amino acids. The <italic>AmphiSyn-long </italic>transcript consists of 12 exons (size between 36 and 248 bp) spanning 36 kb of genomic DNA of the scaffold 37 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). The <italic>AmphiSyn-short </italic>transcript differs from the long form for the deletion of exon 10 and 11.</p><p>The ancestral condition of a single synapsin gene was previously demonstrated in some invertebrate species such as two ecdysozoans (the fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster </italic>and the nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and three lophotrochozoans (the mollusks: <italic>Loligo pealei</italic>, <italic>Aplysia californica </italic>and <italic>Helix pomatia</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Our results confirm that it was likely that a single synapsin gene was present in the chordate ancestor. Beyond analyzing the conservation at the chordates origin, we tested whether this conservation could be further extended in evolution. Systematic searches for synapsins-related sequences were carried out in the genome of a deuterostome (echinoderm <italic>Strongylocentrotus purpuratus</italic>), a lophotrochozoan (annelid <italic>Capitella capitata</italic>), and a diploblast, the cnidarian sea anemone <italic>Nematostella vectensis</italic>, representing one of the morphologically simplest metazoans. Such analysis confirmed that synapsin genes are metazoan genes present in a single copy per genome, except for vertebrates (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Genomic organization of SYN locus</title><p>In mammals, each of the synapsin genes is associated with a single specific <italic>TIMP </italic>(tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases) gene (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The members of the TIMP family are specific endogenous polypeptide inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), degrading enzymes that participate in the extracellular matrix turnover. In mammals, four <italic>TIMP </italic>(1-4) genes are known, three of which are nested with a specific <italic>SYN </italic>gene (<italic>SYN1-TIMP1</italic>, <italic>SYN2-TIMP4</italic>, <italic>SYN3-TIMP3</italic>), whereas a single <italic>TIMP </italic>(<italic>TIMP2</italic>) is independent of the SYN locus (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). The nested TIMP proteins are similar in size and are encoded by five exons. In mammals, the gene structure of the SYN locus is highly conserved because the nested TIMPs are found at the same locations. To gain a more complete understanding of synapsin biology, we examined the evolutionary history of synapsin genes through genomic analysis of SYN locus of some protostome and deuterostome species and searched the genome sequences for member of TIMP families and identified independent TIMPs in some invertebrates (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). The nested SYN-TIMP organization appears to be maintained throughout metazoan evolution, with the only exception of the SYN locus of the <italic>C. elegans </italic>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). A comparative analysis of the SYN-locus of several <italic>Caenorhabditis </italic>species together with that of the parasitic nematode <italic>Brugia malayi </italic>confirms that the absence of nested TIMP is a specific feature of the nematode's clade (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). Furthermore, a multi-alignment of the synapsin proteins shows that the location of nested TIMP sequences is conserved in all analyzed species (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>) even if they are encoded by different introns. The SYN locus of amphioxus, <italic>Capitella</italic>, <italic>Drosophila </italic>and <italic>Nematostella </italic>is characterized by a single TIMP sequence within a single intron of the synapsin gene. Instead, the <italic>Ciona </italic>and <italic>Strongylocentrotus </italic>SYN loci possess two or multiple copies of TIMPs within one intron of the synapsin gene. Moreover, we identified independent and dependent TIMPs in both the amphioxus and <italic>Nematostella </italic>genomes, as well as in humans. However, due to the extreme divergence of both nested and independent TIMP sequences in invertebrates, it is not possible to identify their orthology with vertebrate TIMPs based on their amino acid sequences.</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Structure of the synapsin proteins domains and synapsin genes in representative metazoan phyla</bold>. <bold>A</bold>: A multialignment of synapsin proteins corresponding to the bordering exons containing the introns encoding for TIMP sequences.

All human synapsin genes exhibit similarities in their exon structure in both the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal and central regions, whereas the COOH-terminal regions are more variable. In fact, the COOH-terminal region of the human paralogs is involved in alternative splicing of synapsin genes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p><p>Comparison of the conservation of the exon/intron boundaries from representative metazoan phyla revealed the presence of several introns in conserved positions. Furthermore, several orthologous exons, in which the predicted amino acid sequences from invertebrates and humans can be aligned over the entire length (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>), were observed. We referred to the conservation of the protein domains (A-, C- and E-domains) that can be recognized in all species, although the relative position of B and D domains of human synapsin Ia were also considered.</p><p>The coding sequences of the C domain are conserved with respect to its exonic location, except for <italic>Ciona </italic>and <italic>Drosophila </italic>where the C domain begins with the third exon. The A domain is encoded by a sequence within the first exon; the only exception is found in <italic>Ciona </italic>and <italic>Drosophila </italic>synapsins in which the A domain begins respectively seven and thirteen amino acid residues from the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminus of the protein, and in <italic>Nematostella </italic>synapsin that does not have a clear counterpart of A domain in its first exon. The E domain is contained within the last exon in all sequences, although <italic>Nematostella </italic>has a highly divergent E domain.</p><p>The gene architecture of the C-domain is well conserved in terms of both intron phases and exon sizes in all analyzed metazoans (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). However, some conserved intron loss events were observed. For instance, amphioxus has an exon 2 that is split in two exons in other species, whereas <italic>Ciona</italic>, <italic>Drosophila </italic>and <italic>Nematostella </italic>show a single exon (respectively 7, 7 and 6) corresponding to the mammal orthologous exons 6 and 7. Furthermore, <italic>Ciona </italic>has an intron loss at exon 8, that is also shown by <italic>Capitella</italic>. However, in general the C-domain intron loss events are well conserved across different invertebrate species.</p><p>Comparison of exon/intron organization at C domain level between human synapsin I and the invertebrate sequences shows that the organization of <italic>S. purpuratus </italic>is the most conserved (eight exons completely conserved in length), followed by the C-domain of amphioxus with six exons, <italic>Nematostella </italic>and <italic>Capitella </italic>with five exons completely conserved plus one orthologous exon that differs for very few nucleotides, and by <italic>Ciona </italic>with four completely conserved exons. The situation varies widely in <italic>Drosophila </italic>and <italic>Caenorhabditis </italic>that show highly divergent exonic sequences.</p></sec><sec><title>Protein sequence and phylogenetic analysis</title><p>Vertebrate synapsins are a mosaic of multiple protein domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. While the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal portion contains two highly conserved domains named A and C, connected by the slightly less conserved domain B, the COOH-terminal portion arises from the combinatorial arrangement of numerous individual domains (domains D-J), including the highly conserved E domain which is shared among the a isoforms of the three human synapsin genes. Synapsins are excellent substrates for a variety of protein kinases. Protein phosphorylation sites have been extensively characterized in human synapsins. At least eight sites (sites 1-8) have been demonstrated experimentally in human synapsin I (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Sequence analysis allowed us to identify the three classical conserved domain A, C and E in the <italic>Ciona </italic>synapsin and in the two amphioxus isoforms. To gain a better understanding of the evolution of synapsin domains, we analyzed a multiple alignment of synapsin isoforms from <italic>Homo sapiens </italic>and several invertebrates (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>). Such analysis revealed that the highest degree of sequence conservation occurs in the C domain while a lower identity is found in E and A domains. However, there were no significant similarities with the other human domains.</p><p>Using pair-wise comparison, we found that both amphioxus and <italic>Ciona </italic>possess between 32-40%, 62-68%, 51-62%, identity to the A, C and E domains of humans, respectively (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>). At the same time, lophotrochozoans also share significant sequence identity in the three conserved domains. Interestingly, even if <italic>Nematostella </italic>seems to lack a true comparable A domain, and possesses a highly divergent E domain, it shares between 57-61% sequence identity with the C domain of humans, while <italic>Drosophila </italic>and <italic>Caenorhabditis </italic>display only 50% and 30% identity (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>).</p><p>The highly conserved C domain is the largest of the synapsin domains (approximately 300 amino acids). Studies on the crystal structure of the domain C suggest that it is structurally similar to ATP utilizing enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], with an ATP-binding domain. Such domain was detected in all analyzed synapsin proteins (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>). Moreover, all analyzed synapsins contain residues that are known to be responsible for ATP binding in mammals (Lys<sup>225</sup>, Lys<sup>269 </sup>and Gly<sup>276 </sup>in human synapsin I), except for <italic>Caenorhabditis </italic>synapsin in which there are Lys<sup>225 </sup>Arg and Lys<sup>269 </sup>Ser substitutions (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>).</p><p>The B-domain, as well as the domain connecting the C- and the E- domains, show little primary sequence identity between vertebrate synapsin I and invertebrate synapsins (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>). However, the proline-rich region between C- and E-domains is maintained in almost all invertebrate synapsins, although it is shorter than in human synapsins. The only exception was found in <italic>Nematostella</italic>, in which the linker region between C- and E-domains is too short to be considered as an effective proline-rich domain (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>).</p><p>The E-domain is a quite evolutionary-conserved region, especially for its COOH-terminal portion (~16 amino acids, see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>), supporting the finding that this region is of functional significance. In fact, the COOH-terminal region of E domain seems to be involved in modulating neurotransmitter release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>We also predicted the putative phosphorylation sites in the various invertebrate sequences by using PredPhospho and NetPhosK 1.0 and compared them with those of humans (Additional files <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>). The most conserved consensus site is site 1 within A domain, which is a predicted site for phosphorylation by PKA and CaMKI/IV in all invertebrate synapsins except for <italic>Nematostella</italic>, which has a very divergent domain A (Additional files <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>). The two phosphorylation sites for mitogen-activated protein kinase-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (MAPK/ERK) in the B-domain (sites 4, 5) are well conserved across invertebrate species, especially site 5, that is absent only in <italic>Ciona </italic>(Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>). Interestingly, our prediction highlighted the presence of other putative phosphorylation sites in the C-domain (named A, B, C, D and E) and in E domain (named X and Y) (Additional files <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>) that appear to be conserved in most of the analyzed species.</p><p>To investigate the evolutionary history of synapsin family, we carried out phylogenetic analyses with sequences from representative species using both NJ and ML methods, yielding very similar results (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). In this study, we presented only the ML tree with bootstrap values from both NJ and ML analyses. Phylogenetic analysis using several invertebrate and vertebrate synapsin proteins locates Ci-Syn in proximity of the vertebrate clade synapsins, while AmphiSyn results shifted nearest the chordate common ancestor.

Transcripts were first detected in 14-hour neurulae in four cell clusters of the neural plate (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A-C</xref>). Such clusters are periodically arranged following the boundary of the somites, beginning at S1/2 and extending to S4/5. Closer examination of such embryos in cross section (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>) revealed that transcripts were primarily confined on either side of the ventral midline. The same periodicity was also maintained in 16-hour neurulae even if, in front of S1/S2 boundary, a further rostral cluster of cells appeared (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>). As development proceeded, <italic>AmphiSyn </italic>expression extended in the posterior neural tube, but the periodicity of positive cell clusters became less evident (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E</xref>). Cross sections localized the expressing cells throughout the ventral extent of the neural tube (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4F-I</xref>) except for few positive dorsal nerve cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4G</xref>) that increased just after the first dorsal ocellus (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E</xref>). By 18 hr, a new expressing domain became evident in single epidermal cells located ventro-laterally along the body of the embryo. Such epidermal cells were preferentially localized in the sub-epidermal layer (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4F, H, J, K</xref>), although few labeled cells also appeared to reside in the epidermal sheet (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4H, I</xref>). Two distinct cell populations in the sub-epidermal sheet were found: the first one was characterized by spherical cells preferentially localized in the mid-ventral region (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4J</xref>); the second consisted of elongated cells residing in the ventro-lateral region (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4H, J, K</xref>). At the late-neurula stage (20 hr), the expression in epidermal cells shifted in a more dorsal region (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4L</xref>). At this stage, we observed a synchronized development between the epidermal cells expressing <italic>AmphiSyn </italic>and the underlying somites (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4L</xref>).

Our analysis revealed that protochordates, as well as several invertebrates, possess a single synapsin gene, whereas higher vertebrates have three synapsins genes. It is, therefore, safe to assume that prior to the two rounds of vertebrate genome duplication (2R hypothesis) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], only a single synapsin gene existed. On the other hand, at least two synapsin genes have been identified in the lamprey and three genes are present in higher vertebrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Moreover, synapsin genes from lower organisms appeared to have a genomic architecture similar to the vertebrate synapsins. Such conservation has mainly occurred in the C-domain, although some conserved introns loss events were observed.</p><p>A comparison of the synapsin locus between mammals and several invertebrate species showed that the nested organization of TIMP and synapsin is a general feature that has been conserved during evolution. A well-conserved guest/host relationship is that of the TIMPs within the synapsin gene family (<italic>Syn1/TIMP-1</italic>, <italic>Syn3/TIMP-3 </italic>and <italic>Syn2/TIMP4</italic>), which is maintained from <italic>Drosophila </italic>to human [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Here we demonstrate that such genomic organization arose very early during metazoan evolution, being also present in the sea anemone, <italic>N. vectensis</italic>. These data match the new theory that before the emergence of bilateral animals, cnidarians split from the main animal lineage and their genome retained many of the features present in the last common ancestor of animals.</p><p>In addition, our results demonstrate that the ancestral Syn-TIMP locus has undergone different duplication events. In fact, TIMP not nested within a synapsin gene, previously demonstrated only in vertebrates, was also found in <italic>Nematostella </italic>and amphioxus. Interestingly, two deuterostomes not having an independent TIMP, such as sea urchin and <italic>Ciona</italic>, possess a peculiar TIMP organization with more than one TIMP within the intron of the synapsin gene. Such data support the view that the ancestral organization of SYN locus resembles much more that of amphioxus and <italic>Nematostella</italic>, whereas the genomic organization of urochordates and echinoderms was lineage-specific and more divergent. We conclude that strong stabilizing pressures have been enforced throughout metazoan evolution to maintain the comparable genomic organization of present-day synapsin gene locus across diverse taxa.</p></sec><sec><title>Evolutionary conserved domain architecture of synapsin proteins</title><p>In the present work, we show that almost all invertebrate synapsins share similarities among the evolutionary conserved domains A, C and E, even if <italic>Nematostella </italic>lacks a clear A-domain. Therefore, the multiple synapsin domains seem to have evolved at different rates throughout evolution. During the evolution of vertebrates, at least two gene duplication events can be hypothesized to give rise to the synapsin gene family and these events were probably accompanied by the emergence of additional domains (D-J).</p><p>In order to obtain a more exhaustive characterization of the evolution of synapsin domain architecture and their relationships in metazoans, we took advantage of the wide range of genomes now available (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5</xref>). BLAST searching in the current genomic and EST databases of other basal, <italic>i.e</italic>. diploblastic, animals failed to identify synapsin-related sequences in sponges (<italic>Amphimedon queenslandica</italic>), while positive results were obtained from other cnidarians species including <italic>Hydra magnipapillata </italic>and <italic>Acropora millepora</italic>. Unfortunately, these sequences are clearly incomplete, due to gap in the genome and EST and/or difficulties to predict complete open reading frame. In addition, no synapsin sequences have been identified in the <italic>Trichoplax adhaerens</italic>, representing the basal metazoan phylum <italic>Placozoa</italic>, as well as the choanoflagellate <italic>Monosiga brevicollis</italic>, which branches as the closest known outgroup to metazoans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Outside metazoans, synapsin-related sequences were retrieved from protozoans: in the amoeba-flagellate <italic>Naegleria gruberi </italic>and in the amoebozoa <italic>Entamoeba histolytica </italic>(Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5</xref>). Interestingly, the sequences identified in these two protozoans encode for two proteins characterized by a single domain sharing significant sequence identity with the C-domain of invertebrates and vertebrates synapsins (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S6">6</xref>).</p><p>Thus, one possible hypothesis on the evolution of synapsin proteins is that new domains were added at various stages of evolution probably to cope up with the increased complexity in protein functions which paralleled the increased complexity of the nervous system (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). In particular, we suggest that: 1) a single C-domain was already present in protozoans; 2) the E-domain appeared to have co-evolved with C-domain in basal metazoans. The conservation of the E-domain over such a wide phylogenetic distance, suggests that it shares a function common to all eumetazoans (cnidarians + bilaterians); 3) three conserved domains (A, C and E) appeared with protostomia and subsequently were maintained in deuterostomia and chordates (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). Thus, the emergence of E domain appears to be correlated with the beginning of the genesis of nervous organization, since the simplest metazoans known to possess a nervous system are those of the phylum <italic>Cnidaria </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>].</p><fig id="F8" position="float"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p><bold>Schematic diagram showing the possible evolution of synapsin protein domains</bold>.

In amphioxus, we demonstrated the occurrence of a short and a long isoforms in the comparable region of squid synapsin (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>). The amphioxus short isoform differs from the long form for the deletion of exons 10 and 11 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p><p>Looking at the splicing events impacting known functional domains of the synapsins, we can suggest that invertebrate isoforms are not comparable to those of the vertebrates (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>). In fact, the major splicing events in vertebrate synapsin transcripts encode for truncated proteins, missing the COOH-terminal end of the E-domain. In contrast, some invertebrate alternative splice forms (such as those of <italic>Drosophila </italic>and <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic>), involving the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal coding region, affect the A-domain, whereas others (such as those of amphioxus and squid) alter the domain that follows C domain. Only the isoform c of <italic>Drosophila</italic>, lacking the last part of E domain, shares some similarity with the alternative splice form Ib of human synapsin (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>). Finally, the highly sequence identity within the E-domains of vertebrate synapsins Ia, IIa, IIIa, and the evolutionary conservation of such domain provide evidence that the ancestral synapsin gene encoded for an a-like synapsin isoform.</p></sec><sec><title>Synapsin expression in post-mitotic phase of CNS development in amphioxus and <italic>Ciona</italic></title><p>Early during development, some organisms, such as nematodes and ascidians, show a remarkably invariant pattern of cell divisions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>], and the pattern is so stereotyped that each cell can be individually named. Such type of developmental process has been extensively used to precise embryonic origins of the various neuronal types in these model organisms.</p><p>Since ascidian embryos show such invariant pattern of early cleavage, it has been possible to trace a mitotic descendant map of cells forming the CNS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Interestingly in <italic>Ciona</italic>, all cells that express <italic>Ci-Syn </italic>had ceased their mitotic activity. Cells within the prospective sensory vesicle cease division as 13<sup>th</sup>-generation, with the exception of four cells that become post-mitotic in their 10<sup>th </sup>(1), 11<sup>th </sup>(2), or 12<sup>th </sup>(1) generation. The position of the two <italic>Ci-Syn </italic>positive cells in mid-neurula embryos is compatible with that of the A/A10.57 cells, which had ceased mitotic activity in their 10<sup>th </sup>generation. In initial tailbud embryos, the observed positive spots most probably correspond to the A/A11.117 and A/A11.118 cells, daughters of A/A10.59, which had entered the post-mitotic phase in their 11<sup>th </sup>generation. Up to this stage, <italic>Ci-Syn </italic>transcripts are restricted in cells of the "A" line. By mid tailbud stage, after neurulation is completed, other cells become post-mitotic, including cells of the "a" line of prospective central nervous system, and in parallel <italic>Ci-Syn </italic>expression extends to these territories. In fact, in mid tailbud embryos <italic>Ci-Syn </italic>transcripts are present in the dorsal anterior sensory vesicle in the precursors of otolith and ocellus (a/a 10.97) and in two more rostral small cells, near the opening of the neuropore, most probably a/a 10.102, that will contribute to form the neurohypophyseal complex of the larva. Moreover, at this stage <italic>Ci-Syn </italic>is expressed in a row of cells in the floor plate of the posterior sensory vesicle, corresponding to A/A 10.27 and A/A 10.28 post mitotic cells. By this stage, an additional pair of cells becomes post-mitotic in the prospective visceral ganglion: the A/A 12.239 cells. Together with the A/A 10.57, the A/A 11.117 and the A/A 11.118, that had ceased mitotic activity in earlier stages, form a group of eight paired neurons located in the ventro-lateral position of the visceral ganglion, where cholinergic motor neurons have been identified in hatching larva [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Thus, cholinergic neurons are the first ones to differentiate in the embryos. Other post mitotic cells derive from A/A 10.63 and are located at the caudal tip of the neural tube. These cells clearly correspond to the <italic>Ci-Syn </italic>positive ones observed in tail and complete the pattern of <italic>Ci-Syn </italic>expression in mid tailbud embryos. Moreover, in embryos up to this stage, all post-mitotic cells are <italic>Ci-Syn </italic>positive and all <italic>Ci-Syn </italic>positive cells are post mitotic. Therefore, <italic>Ci-Syn </italic>expression can be considered an early marker of neuronal specification.</p><p>On the contrary, amphioxus, as well as vertebrates, do not possess this type of determinate cell lineage. More recently, the marker of cell division 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) has been used in amphioxus to assess developmental cell proliferation, showing that only some regions of the neural plate are BrdU labeled during neurogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. In particular in mid-neurulae, only a region in the most anterior and posterior-third of the neural plate contained proliferating cells. During the subsequent phase of development, few dividing cells were present in the middle of cerebral vesicle at level of the neuropore and in some scattered cells along the posterior neural tube. A comparison between expression patterns of <italic>AmphiSyn </italic>and BrdU data suggests that during CNS development BrdU labeled cells correspond to the <italic>AmphiSyn</italic>-negative zone. Therefore, we can argue that <italic>AmphiSyn </italic>is a marker for postmitotic cells that have been committed to a neuronal phenotype. Although at present it is not possible to establish where the first neurons to be born are located, the most interesting observation is that the earlier expression of <italic>AmphiSyn </italic>corresponded to the region of the neural plate where the locomotory control system will develop. In such region, several interneurons and motor neurons have been demonstrated to be cholinergic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Such assumptions are quite intriguing when compared with tunicates, in which, as above stated, the first neurons which differentiate are cholinergic. Our results shown that <italic>AmphiSyn </italic>and <italic>Ci-Syn </italic>are restricted to the post-mitotic phase of CNS development and probably are good markers of postmitotic neurons.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>AmphiSyn </italic>expression in the CNS</title><p>The central nervous system of amphioxus lacks an anatomical partition into fore-, mid- and hind-brain regions although several studies suggested the presence of specific anatomical domains of vertebrate brains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. The amphioxus CNS consists of a cerebral vesicle (the swelling at the anterior end of the nerve cord), corresponding to a diencephalic forebrain and a possible midbrain region, and a posterior hindbrain followed by a spinal cord.</p><p>From an evolutionary point of view, the most significant observation of the earlier <italic>AmphiSyn </italic>expression is its segmental organization into the area in which the hindbrain region develops. On the other hand, the expression in amphioxus embryos of motor neuron markers (such as <italic>islet, shox, AmphiKrox, AmphiMnx </italic>and <italic>AmphiErr</italic>) suggests the occurrence of a segmental organization of cell types in the hindbrain region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. Therefore, even if the amphioxus hindbrain homologous lacks a clear anatomical subdivision in rhombomeres, the segmental expression of several genes in such region seems to be regulated by adjacent somites as proposed by Mazet and Shimeld [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. The importance of the somites for segmental neuron organization during amphioxus neurogenesis is also confirmed by the present work. In fact, <italic>AmphiSyn </italic>expression shows a clear segmental arrangement with cell pairs at the junctions between somites, at least at the early stage of neuronal differentiation.</p><p>At larval stage, <italic>AmphiSyn </italic>expression was confined in some very anterior cells of the cerebral vesicle, likely photoreceptor cells of the frontal eye complex, and in cells of the posterior cerebral vesicle. In the latter, a zone of motor neurons and large interneurones also known as primary motor centre (PMC), has been described. The PMC has been homologized to the reticulospinal neurons in the midbrain and hindbrain of craniates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>], and probably represents the region where neurotransmission via chemical synapses is most abundant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>].</p><p>The present data on <italic>AmphiSyn </italic>expression seems also to support the absence of typical chemical synapses in the central region of cerebral vesicle. The staining gap in the cerebral vesicle corresponds to the region where the preinfundibular region is found. The preinfundibular region, a set of ciliated accessory cells, lacks typical chemical synapses, and a paracrine release has been postulated as the preferential modality of transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>].</p><p><italic>AmphiSyn</italic>-labeled cells were also identified more widely in the posterior larval nerve cord in the hindbrain-like region. Such cells are arranged as rows positioned ventrolaterally in the nerve cord, representing both motor neurons and interneurons. Several types of neurons in this region have been demonstrated to be cholinergic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Few labeled cells located dorsally in the nerve cord are mainly found posterior to the first dorsal ocellus, except for some very anterior cells located in the posterior cerebral vesicle at the level of the lamellar body. In the latter, dopaminergic neurons have been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title><italic>AmphiSyn </italic>expression in PNS</title><p><italic>AmphiSyn </italic>expression appears in the general ectoderm in single cells scattered along the body of the mid-neurulae and its expression increases during the elongation of the embryo. These cells probably correspond to the epidermal sensory neurons belonging to the PNS. The PNS of amphioxus is composed of several types of neurons, and at least two types of epidermal sensory cells, widely distributed along either sides of the body, have been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. The type I receptors are primary sensory neurons having axons projecting to CNS, whereas the type II receptors are axonless secondary sensory neurons with synaptic terminals arising at short distances from the cell body. The former begin to differentiate at neurula stage while the latter start differentiation at early metamorphic larval stage. In amphioxus, differentiating type I receptors express several neuronal markers (<italic>AmphiTrk, AmphiHu/Elav, AmphiCoe, AmphiPOU-IV, SoxB, AmphiTlx</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>], as well as <italic>AmphiSyn</italic>.</p><p>In mid-neurulae, <italic>AmphiSyn</italic>-labeled cells first appeared as single epidermal cells located ventro-laterally. The cross sections revealed that most of labeled cells are found in the space between the epidermis and the deeper tissue layer. In some cases these cells exhibit a round shape, whilst in others they are elongated, probably indicating two distinct phases of sensory neuron differentiation.</p><p>The appearance of new <italic>AmphiSyn</italic>-expressing cells in the more dorsal position of the animal body in later neurula stages, strictly resembles the expression pattern of <italic>Amphi-Trk</italic>, <italic>AmphiHu/Elav </italic>and <italic>AmphiCoe </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>]. The migration of the positive signal from ventral regions to the dorsal area and from the external layer to the subepidermal one during development, raises the question of whether this effect is due to cell migration or represents a gene expression shift. A first attempt to demonstrate such hypothesis was tentatively proved by DiI labeling experiments on amphioxus, showing that ventrally-located cells migrate toward dorso-lateral sides of the embryo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. More recently, the origin, migration, and differentiation of type I receptors in amphioxus have been described by SEM investigation and expression studies of <italic>AmphiTlx </italic>gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>]. Such data support the idea that primary sensory neurons, developing directly from the ventral epidermis, migrate into the subepidermal sheet. During migration from ventral to dorso-lateral position, cells morphology changes: firstly round cells located ventrally lose the cilium and extend pseudopodia, subsequently elongated cells that have reached the flanks of the body give rise to an axon before reinserting their perikaria in the epidermal sheet. <italic>AmphiTlx </italic>is the first gene that shows clearly nascent type 1 receptors in the process of delaminating from the general epidermis and entering the subepidermal space. However, <italic>AmphiTlx </italic>expression is downregulated before receptor cell erupts in the epithelium.</p><p><italic>AmphiSyn </italic>gene is interesting because it turns on moderately early in the migrating sensory neurons and evidently continues to be transcribed during axogenesis (and perhaps during reinsertion of the perikaria into the epidermis). On the other hand, clear examination of cross sections of the same embryo (mid-neurulae and late-neurulae) showed <italic>AmphiSyn-</italic>positive cells located either in the epidermis or just beneath it. Therefore, precursors of type I receptors begin to express <italic>AmphiSyn </italic>as they start to migrate and continue to strongly express the gene also after their complete differentiation.</p><p>Another interesting point is the observation that, in late neurulae, <italic>AmphiSyn</italic>-labeled cells are in register with the somites. Such arrangement is also visible in the SEM specimens reported by Kaltenbach and coworkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>], where the migrating sensory cells appear situated at an indentation of epidermal cells at the level of intersomitic junctions. Thus, it is possible that the direction of cell migration is controlled by the somite borders. However, more work needs to be done to elucidate the patterning of amphioxus type I receptors in relation to the mesoderm.</p><p>In early larvae, the number of epidermal <italic>AmphiSyn</italic>-labeled cells increases in the more dorsal middle of the body, as well as in more posterior and anterior regions. In the rostral region, two large cell bodies lying at some distance from the mouth, just behind and below the preoral pit, are strongly labeled. Such cells belong to the oral nerve plexus surrounding the amphioxus larva mouth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. The expression pattern in the epidermal cells also persists in later stages of larval development in individual cells arranged as rows along the midline of the flanks of the body. At this stage, expression is also visible in the most anterior tip of the larva in the presumptive primary sensory neurons belonging to the corpuscles of de Quatrefages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>], structures having some similarities to the vertebrate olfactory placodes.</p></sec><sec><title>Expression of <italic>Ci-Syn </italic>in CNS and PNS</title><p>In late tailbud embryos <italic>Ci-Syn </italic>is broadly expressed in all the prospective central nervous system, as the number of mature neurons increases and the single cells can not be identified any longer. In the larva, <italic>Ci-Syn </italic>transcripts are present in both CNS and PNS. In the sensory vesicle, <italic>Ci-Syn </italic>expression is present in all major clusters of neurons, including the photoreceptor cells, the eminens cells and the coronet cells. These cells have bulbous protrusions extending in the lumen of the sensory vesicle, express <italic>Ci-TH </italic>and were suggested to be related to the vertebrate hypothalamic primordium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>]. <italic>Ci-Syn </italic>transcripts were also found in the area of the otolith, which seems to be a static mechanoreceptor.</p><p><italic>Ci-Syn </italic>transcripts are completely absent in the most anterior part of the sensory vesicle (anterior to the otolith), where only glial cells have been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>], and are particularly abundant in the posterior region. This region has been recently named "posterior brain" (PB) by Horie and coworkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] to distinguish it from the anterior region consisting of the ventricular cavity and surrounding cells, including sensory organs. The PB contains a number of diverse interneurons, some of which form synaptic connections within the PB, and others send projections to the visceral ganglion. They presumably form neural circuits for sensory information processing and motor regulation, since many sensory neurons send axons that gather in the PB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>]. The widespread expression of <italic>Ci-Syn </italic>is a further evidence of the large amount of neuronal connections present in this area. In histological sections, the distribution of <italic>Ci-Syn </italic>transcripts in this area is characteristically uneven and probably labels specific subpopulations of neurons whose function is still to be investigated. Notably, in this area several types of chemically-identified neuronal types have been reported, including glutamatergic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>], cholinergic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] and GABAergic neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. To account for the high number of neurons described in this region, neurons may be present also in <italic>Ci-Syn</italic>-negative areas. The expression of synaptotagmin, another synaptic vesicle protein expressed in the ascidian nervous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], in later stage is partially overlapping with the synapsin one, particularly in the sensory vesicle and the visceral ganglion, but it is detectable also in earlier stages. At the larva stage, synaptotagmin is widely expressed in the sensory vesicle, in some visceral ganglion motor neurons, in all the antero-trunkal epidermal neurons as well as in the caudal epidermal neurons (CEN). Thus, it is possible that a differential distribution of synapse-specific proteins exists in the PNS. In fact, the ARTENa and ARTENp, some ventral RTEN and the CEN do not express <italic>Ci-Syn</italic>, but they are synaptotagmin-positive. We can suppose that synaptotagmin, as others synaptic proteins, should contribute to similar function during development in different cells types and nervous regions.</p><p>At larval stage, the most interesting data show the presence in the nerve cord of <italic>Ci-Syn </italic>in the cell soma of the planate neurons, near the base of the tail as well as along its length. These neurons are monopolar with elongated somata aligned along the trajectory of the ventrolateral nerve bundles, whose axon projects in either caudal or rostral direction, and the most distal of them lay halfway along the tail [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. This is consistent with our finding, since <italic>Ci-Syn </italic>expression reaches the level of bipolar epidermal neurons in the middle of the tail.</p></sec><sec><title>Protochordate and vertebrate synapsins: a comparative overview</title><p>Synapsins are expressed throughout the central and peripheral nervous systems, and their expression varies across synapse types and brain regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">73</xref>]. In mammals, synapsins I and II are expressed predominantly in adult brain, whereas synapsin III appears more abundant in the fetal brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Moreover, synapsin III is required for initial cell elongation and early axon outgrowth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. <italic>AmphiSyn </italic>and <italic>Ci-Syn </italic>are both expressed in CNS starting at the neurula stage, where they seem to have a role in neuronal differentiation. In particular, the early expression of <italic>AmphiSyn </italic>and <italic>Ci-Syn </italic>in the developing motor neurons suggests a role for these genes in the formation of neuromuscular synapses, as already demonstrated for synapsins I and II in the <italic>Xenopus </italic>embryo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">74</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Moreover, human synapsin I has been found in afferent nerve calyces surrounding type I hair cells and in sensory endings of taste buds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">75</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B77">77</xref>]. At the same time, synapsins in protochordates are expressed in PNS, namely in specific subpopulations of general (non-CNS) ectoderm, representing primary sensory neurons.</p><p>In mammals, synapsin I and II are not expressed in the ribbon synapses of the retina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B78">78</xref>], and in some invertebrates, synapsins seem to be present only in interneurons of the visual system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B79">79</xref>]. On the contrary, both amphioxus and <italic>Ciona </italic>show a high concentration of synapsin transcripts in different types of the photoreceptive system, i.e. the ocellus-related cells in ascidian and the frontal eye complex and Hesse organ in amphioxus. On the other hand, the vertebrate retina is constituted by two distinct types of vesicle-containing synapses: conventional synapses, found in amacrine cells, and ribbon synapses (peculiar of vertebrates), found in photoreceptor and bipolar cells. Mandell and coworkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B78">78</xref>] described in several vertebrate species the absence of synapsins I and II immunoreactivities from all retina ribbon-synapses, but a high abundance of synapsin proteins in the conventional synapses of amacrine cells. However, synapsins have been identified in both cone and rod cells of bovine retina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B80">80</xref>], suggesting that the complement of vesicle-associated proteins can vary between species.</p><p>Moreover, there are further CNS structures of amphioxus and <italic>Ciona </italic>having a similar distribution of synapsin transcripts, and such structures show a certain degree of similarity. For example, the sensory vesicle of the ascidian has been considered the counterpart of the cerebral vesicle of amphioxus. In particular, the otolith and ocellus are homologized with the balance organ and the lamellar body of amphioxus larvae, a clear parallel has also been suggested between the visceral ganglion of tunicate and the primary motor centre of amphioxus larva [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B81">81</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Herein, we assembled and analyzed experimentally cloned and computationally predicted amino acid sequences of the synapsin genes from mammals, protochordates and several invertebrate species.
