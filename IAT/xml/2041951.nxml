Steroidogenic cells from Day -6 bovine corpus luteum (CL) were isolated and transfected to reduce PKCepsilon expression after 48, 72 and 96 h. A third tested hypothesis was that an increase in intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca(2+)]i) is the cellular mechanism through which PGF2alpha inhibits luteal progesterone. The hypothesis was tested with two pharmacological agents. In the first test, the dose-dependent effects on raising the [Ca(2+)]i with the ionophore, A23187, on basal and LH-stimulated P4 secretion in cells collected from early (Day -4) and mid-cycle (Day -10) bovine CL was examined. In the second test, the ability of PGF2alpha to inhibit LH-stimulated P4 secretion in Day-10 luteal cells was examined under conditions in which an elevation in [Ca(2+)]i had been buffered by means of the intracellular calcium chelator, Bapta-AM.</p><p>PKCepsilon expression was reduced 65 and 75% by 72 and 96 h after transfection, respectively. In cells in which PKCepsilon expression was ablated by 75%, the inhibitory effect of PGF2alpha on LH-stimulated P4 secretion was only 29% lower than in the LH-stimulated group. In contrast, it was reduced by 75% in the group where PKCepsilon expression had not been reduced (P &#x0003c; 0.05). Real time PCR analysis indicated that there were no differences in the expression of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), aldoketoreductase 1B5 (AKR1B5), prostaglandin E synthase (PGES), hydroxyprostaglandin-15 dehydrogenase (PGDH) and PGE2 -9-reductase as a function of PKCepsilon down-regulation. Finally, LH stimulated secretion of P4 at each luteal stage (Day -4 and -10), and PGF2alpha inhibited this only in Day -10 cells (P &#x0003c; 0.05). When A23187 was used at concentrations greater than 0.1 &#x003bc;mol, the induced elevation in [Ca(2+)]i inhibited the effect of LH on secretion of P4 in Day -4 and -10 cells (P &#x0003c; 0.05, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). The inhibitory effect of PGF2alpha on LH-stimulated P4 in Day -10 cells was reduced if an increase in [Ca(2+)]i was prevented with Bapta-AM. These results support the hypothesis that differential expression of PKCepsilon and an elevation of [Ca(2+)]i are important for acquisition of luteolytic response to PGF2alpha.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The corpus luteum (CL) is a transient endocrine gland whose primary secretory product is progesterone (P4). The life span of the CL and consequently the amount of P4 it secretes is regulated according to reproductive physiological status. Substances reducing P4 secretion and shortening the luteal life span are said to be luteolytic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>In most species, including human beings, PGF<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; is recognized as an important if not the main luteolytic factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. During the ovarian cycle, the transition from early to mid-luteal phase is associated with changes in resistance/susceptibility to the luteolysin PGF<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1;; in cows, the CL is resistant to exogenous PGF<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; prior to day 5 of the estrous cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The cellular basis controlling luteal function during these physiological transitions, although studied intensely, is incompletely understood.</p><p>In steroidogenic cells of the ruminant CL, PGF<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; activates its plasma membrane G-protein-coupled receptor, which in turn activates the membrane-bound phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C (PLC), yielding inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>) and diacylglycerol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Indeed, in bovine luteal cells, PGF<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; stimulated phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate hydrolysis and mobilized intracellular Ca<sup>2+ </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Accordingly, calcium and protein kinase C (PKC) have been shown to be the intracellular mediators of PGF<sub>2</sub>&#x003b2; actions in luteal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The regulatory effects of intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]i) on progesterone might be biphasic as there is also evidence for a calcium requirement to support P4 synthesis by bovine luteal cells and LH, a luteotrophic hormone, increases IP<sub>3</sub>, and [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]i in bovine luteal cells and in porcine granulosa cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Therefore, there might exist thresholds of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]i that support or inhibit P4 synthesis.</p><p>Choudhary et al, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] tested the ability of increasing concentrations of PGF<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; to increase the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]i in large (LLC) and small (SLC) bovine luteal cells as function of development. Day-10 steroidogenic cells were more responsive to PGF<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; than Day-4 cell. Response amplitudes and number of responding cells were significantly affected by agonist concentration, luteal development and cell type. Response amplitudes were greater in LLC than in SLC; responses of maximal amplitude were elicited with lower agonist concentrations from Day-10 than from Day -4 cells. Furthermore, on Day-10, as concentrations of PGF<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; increased, larger percentages of SLC responded. Based on those results Choudhary et al proposed that the lower efficacy of PGF<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; in the early CL was likely related to signal transduction differences associated with the PGF<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; receptor at those two developmental stages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>The array of PKC isozymes expressed in whole bovine CL includes &#x003b1;, &#x003b2;I, &#x003b2;II, &#x003b5; and &#x003bc;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]; and it has been demonstrated that the amount of PKC&#x003b5; expressed in the Day-10 CL is greater than in the Day-4 CL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. The latter observation led Sen et al, to propose that differential expression of PKC&#x003b5; as a function of development could play a role in the observed transitional resistance/susceptibility to PGF<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1;-induced luteal regression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Sen et al, had further hypothesized that regulation of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]i was a cellular mechanism through which PKC&#x003b5; could mediate actions of PGF<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; on P4 secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Additionally, there is evidence indicating that when bovine follicular theca cells are isolated and their luteinization is induced under in vitro tissue culture conditions, they express PKC&#x003b4; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. As PKC&#x003b4; has been reported to play an important role in other species such as in rabbits and rodents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], this PKC isozyme might also be important for the physiology of the bovine ovary.</p><p>Endothelial cells of the bovine CL do not express PKC&#x003b5;, although they do express the other PKC isozymes described in the bovine CL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Data obtained with Western blot and immunohistological assays indicated that steroidogenic cells are the main source of PKC&#x003b5; in the bovine CL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Therefore, in experiment 1, in order to assess the potential physiological role of PKC&#x003b5;, we have used a siRNA strategy to down- regulate the expression of this PKC isozyme in luteal steroidogenic cells. In experiment 2, we used the PKC&#x003b5; down-regulated cells to test two hypotheses. Our first working hypothesis was that PKC&#x003b5; expression was necessary for PGF<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; to inhibit LH-stimulated P<sub>4 </sub>secretion in vitro. The second working hypothesis was that PKC&#x003b5; was necessary for the expression of key genes of prostaglandin synthesis/metabolism that would favor PGF<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; synthesis; whereas in PKC&#x003b5; down regulated cells, the expression of key genes of prostaglandin synthesis/metabolism would be such that synthesis of PGE2 would be favored. Finally, in experiment 3, we tested the hypothesis that [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]i is the cellular mechanism through which PGF<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; inhibits luteal progesterone. We reasoned that if a pharmacological treatment is used to increase [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]i, this should inhibit luteal progesterone secretion with equally effectiveness, regardless of the developmental stage of the CL. Therefore, we used a pharmacological agent to increase [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]i and examine its effects on LH-induced P<sub>4 </sub>secretion in luteal cells collected from early (Day -4) and mid-cycle (Day -10) bovine CL. Furthermore, this hypothesis was also tested by using a pharmacological agent to buffer any increase in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]i and examine, under conditions of low [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]i, the anti-steroidogenic effect of PGF<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; on LH-induced P4 synthesis/secretion in cultures of luteal cells collected from mid-cycle (Day -10) CL.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Tissue collection</title><p>Non-lactating beef (experiments 1 and 2) or dairy (experiment 3) cows were observed visually for estrus twice daily at approximately 12-h intervals for a minimum of 30 min per observation. The day when standing estrus was observed was designated as Day 0 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. For experiments 1 and 2, the CL from four beef cows on Day-6 of the estrous cycle were collected in ice-cold saline and transported to the laboratory for luteal cell dispersion as described below. For experiment 3, 14 non-lactating dairy cows were synchronized with 25 mg PGF<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; analog (Lutalyse<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>; Pfizer Animal Health., New York, NY) and ovaries on Day -4 (n = 4) or CL on Day -10 (n = 10) were collected surgically as described below and transported to the laboratory in ice-cold saline for dissociation and luteal cell enrichment as described below. The surgical procedure was performed via supravaginal incision under epidural anesthesia. For the epidural anesthesia, 6&#x02013;9 ml 2% lidocaine were administered for cows weighing 450&#x02013;700 kg (Butler Company, Columbus, OH). After surgery, penicillin (300,000 units) was administered intramuscularly to protect against post-surgical infection. The CL or ovary was collected into ice-cold phosphate buffered saline (PBS) at pH 7.4 and transported to the laboratory within 15 to 30 min after collection. The Animal Care and Use Committee of West Virginia University approved all procedures for these experiments (ACUC protocol # 06-0401).</p></sec><sec><title>Luteal cell dispersion and purification</title><p>In the laboratory, the CL was dissected free of connective tissue, weighed, placed into cell dispersion medium (CDM, M-199 containing 0.1% BSA, 25 mM Hepes, 100 U/ml fungicide), and cut into small (about 1 mm<sup>3</sup>) fragments. The tissue fragments were processed for tissue dissociation as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].

The cell population designated as steroidogenic cells represented a heterogeneous population of cells including fibroblasts, pericytes, lymphoid and possibly few endothelial cells not removed by the separation procedure. Cell viability and density were determined using Trypan Blue exclusion and a hemocytometer; luteal cell viability was usually greater than 96%.</p><sec><title>Experiment 1</title><p>Validation of siRNA methodology for specifically down-regulating PKC&#x003b5; expression in enriched steroidogenic luteal cells.</p><p>Day-6 dissociated luteal steroidogenic cells were cultured overnight at a cell density of 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6 </sup>cells/well in 35 mm 24 &#x02013; well culture dishes (Corning Inc, Corning NY) containing 1 ml Medium 199 supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum (FCS, GIBCO) at 37&#x000b0;C (95% air, 5% CO<sup>2</sup>). The next day cells were transiently transfected with PKC&#x003b5;-specific siRNA kit (Upstate Cell Signaling solutions, Lake Placid NY) using lipofectin 2000 kit (Invitrogen Life Technologies) following the procedure recommended by the manufacturer. After transfection for 4 hr, the cultures were provided with M199 supplemented with 10% FCS, and incubated for a total of 48, 72 or 96 hours. After each of these time points, the cells were collected by adding 2 ml M199 containing 0.25% trypsin (GIBCO) to cover the monolayer and leaving the culture dish for about 1 min at room temperature. The cells were aspirated and washed one time with M199 containing 5%FCS and once with M199 without FCS. Cells collected from duplicate wells were pooled and the efficiency of transfection at 48, 72 and 96 h was analyzed by RT-PCR and Western blot analysis. Control groups included cells cultured in presence of M199 alone, M199 and transfecting reagent, and cells treated with non-specific siRNA duplex (non-specific siRNA).</p></sec><sec><title>Experiment 2</title><p>Effects of down-regulating PKC&#x003b5; expression by the siRNA protocol on: A) the ability of PGF<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; to inhibit the LH-stimulated P4 accumulation, and B) on the expression of key genes involved in prostaglandin synthesis and metabolism.</p><p><italic>Hypothesis 1</italic>: PKC&#x003b5; is necessary for PGF<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; to be able to inhibit P<sub>4 </sub>secretion. To examine the ability of PGF<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI) to inhibit LH-induced progesterone accumulation, the siRNA transfected and control cells (not treated with PKC&#x003b5; siRNA) were treated, after 96 h, with100 ng/ml of LH, 1000 ng/ml of PGF<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1;, or a combination of LH and PGF<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; for 4 hrs. After this time, the cell free medium was collected from each treatment and frozen until determination of P4 by radioimmunoassay (RIA). The RIA used for measurements of P4 in the culture media has been described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. The standard curve for this RIA ranged from 10 pg/ml to 800 pg/ml, and the intra- and interassay coefficients of variation were 9.2% and 12.8%, respectively.</p><p><italic>Hypothesis 2</italic>: PKC&#x003b5; is necessary for the expression of key prostaglandin biosynthetic/metabolizing enzymes. For the real time quantitative determination of gene expression of key prostaglandin biosynthetic/metabolizing enzymes in PKC&#x003b5; down-regulated and control (not down-regulated) cells, RNA samples were obtained from the cells collected in the experiment described under Hypothesis 1. The genes examined were: aldoketoredutase 1B5 (AKR1B5), prostaglandin-15 dehydrogenase (PGDH), prostaglandin E synthase (PGES), prostaglandin E-2-9-redutase, and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2). Enriched steroidogenic cells were treated with the PKC&#x003b5; siRNA protocol and after 96 h of culture the cells were treated with LH (100 ng/ml), PGF<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; (1000 ng/ml), or a combination of LH and PGF<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; for 4 h. The cells were collected by a brief trypsin treatment and total RNA was isolated with Trizol reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (GIBCO). Total RNA was quantified spectroscopically at 260 nm and integrity of the RNA was determined by 2% agarose gel electrophoresis. Specific primers were designed by using primer 3 software. The primer sequences and their accession numbers are shown in table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>. The single-step RT-PCR was carried out and cDNA product for each gene was column purified. Ten-fold serial dilutions of cDNA for each of the genes were used as templates to generate standard curves. Total RNA samples were reverse transcribed and used as templates in an iQ5 cycler (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). The 25 &#x003bc;l reaction mixture contained 12.5 &#x003bc;l SYBER green mix (Bio-Rad Laboratories), 2 &#x003bc;l cDNA sample, 2.5 &#x003bc;l each sense and antisense primers (0.5 &#x003bc;mol) and 5.5 &#x003bc;l of RNAse -free H<sub>2</sub>O. The standard curves of threshold cycle (ct value) versus log starting quantity for the genes of interest were obtained. The conditions used were as follows: inactivation of RT enzyme, 95&#x000b0;C/3 min; denaturation, 95&#x000b0;C/30 sec; annealing, 55&#x000b0;C/30 sec; and extension, 72&#x000b0;C/1 min with fluorescence acquisition. The melt-curves were generated from 55&#x000b0;C to 95&#x000b0;C with 0.5&#x000b0;C increments in temperature. The melt-curves were observed for presence of single amplification product. The slope and intercept values obtained from the standard curve were used to determine the starting quantity for each gene using linear regression equation and gene expression for the desired gene was normalized using &#x003b2;-actin as the reference gene.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Primer sequence, accession number, product size and annealing temperature of investigated genes</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left">Gene</td><td align="left">Primers</td><td align="left">Acc#</td><td align="left">Size</td><td align="left">Annealing</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">&#x003b2;-Actin</td><td align="left">F5'GACATCCGCAAGGACCTCTA3'<break/>R5' ACGGAGTACTTGCGCTCAG3'</td><td align="left"><underline>BC102948</underline></td><td align="left">100</td><td align="left">*</td></tr><tr><td align="left">PGDH</td><td align="left">F5'GGAAAGCTGGACATCTTGGT3'<break/>R5'GCAAATTGCGTTCAGTCTCA3'</td><td align="left"><underline>BC102458</underline></td><td align="left">150</td><td align="left">60&#x000b0;C</td></tr><tr><td align="left">PGES-1</td><td align="left">F 5'GAACGACCCAGATGTGGAA3'<break/>R5'ATACGGCCCAGGAAGAAGAC3'</td><td align="left"><underline>NM_174443</underline></td><td align="left">153</td><td align="left">59&#x000b0;C</td></tr><tr><td align="left">AKR1B5</td><td align="left">F 5' GACCTTGGGTACCGTCACAT3'<break/>R5'TCTTTCTCACTGGGAATCACG3'</td><td align="left"><underline>S54973</underline></td><td align="left">150</td><td align="left">59&#x000b0;C</td></tr><tr><td align="left">PGE2 9- Reductase</td><td align="left">F 5'AAGAAATGCAGCCGTGAACT3'<break/>R 5' GCTCCTTCTTCTGGGCTTTT 3'</td><td align="left"><underline>BC102943</underline></td><td align="left">155</td><td align="left">59&#x000b0;C</td></tr><tr><td align="left">COX-2</td><td align="left">F5'CATGATGTTCTTTGTTGGCATT3'<break/>R 5' GCGAATTCCAACTTTCCATC3'</td><td align="left"><underline>AF031698</underline></td><td align="left">154</td><td align="left">60&#x000b0;C</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>&#x02022; Actin was amplified under the same conditions as gene of interest</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec><sec><title>Experiment 3</title><p>The working hypothesis was that a rise in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]i is the cellular mechanism through which PGF<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; inhibits luteal P4.</p><p><italic>Effect of a pharmacological increase in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] i on the LH-stimulated P4 synthesis/secretion in Day-4 and -10 luteal steroidogenic cells</italic>.

The cell-free media were collected and frozen until later measurements of P4 by RIA. The concentrations of A23187 used were based on single-cell studies, in which a concentration of 1 &#x003bc;mol A23187 was usually effective in increasing [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]i to values comparable to those seen when cells were stimulated with PGF<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; at a concentration of 1000 ng/ml. The concentration range used of the Ca<sup>2+ </sup>ionophore should assure a very good probability of eliciting a wide range in increases in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]i that would allow testing its effect on the LH-stimulated P4 synthesis/secretion in Day-4 and -10 steroidogenic cells.</p><p><italic>If the PGF</italic><sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; <italic>-stimulated increase in [Ca</italic><sup>2+</sup><italic>]i is prevented, PGF</italic><sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; <italic>T will not be able to inhibit P4 synthesis/secretion</italic>. This experiment examined the ability of PGF<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; to inhibit LH-stimulated P4 secretion in Day-10 luteal cells under conditions in which elevations in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]i were buffered. This was accomplished by testing the effect of 1,2-bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-N, N, N', N'-teyracetic acid tetrakis acetomethyl ester, Bapta-AM (Invitrogen Detection Technologies, Carlsbad, CA), an effective pharmacological agent known to buffer changes in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]i [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. The concentration range chosen, 0.1 to 1000 &#x003bc;mol, was based on preliminary single-cell studies indicating that at the concentration of 10 &#x003bc;mol, Bapta-AM effectively prevented the typical increase in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]i induced by PGF<sub>2 </sub>in luteal steroidogenic cells. The enriched Day-10 steroidogenic cells (1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5 </sup>cells/well) isolated as described above were cultured overnight in 15 mm 24 -well culture plates in medium M199 supplemented with 0.1% BSA and 0.5% FCS. The next morning, the cells were treated in duplicate wells for 24 hr with M199 (control), LH (100 ng/ml), PGF<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1;, (1.0 &#x003bc;g/ml), and a combination of LH and PGF<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; with increasing concentration of Bapta-AM (0.1, 1, 10, 100 or 1000 &#x003bc;mol). The effect of each treatment on basal and LH -stimulated P4 synthesis/secretion was tested in duplicate wells. The medium for the control group contained 0.1% dimethylsufoxide (DMSO, Pierce Rockport, IL), the solvent used for PGF<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; and Bapta. The cell-free media were collected and frozen until later measurements of P4 by RIA.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Semi-quantitative RT-PCR</title><p>The time-course effectiveness of the siRNA treatment in down-regulating PKC&#x003b5; mRNA expression was determined by a semi-quantitative RT-PCR procedure (RT-PCR, Qiagen, Valencia, CA) previously validated and described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. In this RT-PCR assay, PKC&#x003b5; expression was normalized to the expression of GAPDH as the reference gene. The sequence of the PKC&#x003b5; and GAPDH primers were those previously published: [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], sense 5'-AGCTTGAAGCCCACAGCCTG-3'; antisense 5'-CTTGTGGCCGTTGACCTGATG-3'; and (34), sense 5'- TGTTCCAGTATGATTCCACCC-3'; antisense 5'- TGTTCCAGTATGATTCCACCC-3' respectively. The specificity for these primer sets have been documented (17, 24), and confirmed here by using the nucleotide database of National Center for Biotechnology Information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] with BLAST software. The RT-PCR assay conditions were as follows: 50&#x000b0;C for 30min for reverse transcription reaction, 95&#x000b0;C for 15min for inactivation of RT enzyme, and then for PCR cycles consisted of 95&#x000b0;C for 50seconds for denaturing, 58&#x000b0;C for 30seconds for annealing, 72&#x000b0;C for 1min for extension and a final extension of 5min at 72&#x000b0;C. The RT-PCR products were electrophoresed on 2% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide and viewed using the Fluro-S MultiImager (Bio-Rad Laboratories). Data were collected using densitometric analysis of Quantity One quantification software package (Version 4, Bio-Rad Laboratories).

This effect of LH was completely inhibited by PGF<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; (21.1 &#x000b1; 2.1, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Importantly, basal P4 accumulation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>) was not affected by the Bapta-AM treatment, not even the highest concentration used (20.9 &#x000b1; 4.1). When Bapta-AM was used at 0.1, 1, 10 and 100 &#x003bc;mol in combination with LH, the values on P4 accumulation became intermediate between those observe for basal and LH alone (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>); and the stimulatory effect of LH was completely eliminated by 1000 &#x003bc;mol Bapta (data not shown).

As discussed below, these studies were designed to test the effects of ablating PKC&#x003b5; expression in order to examine its hypothesized function. Previous studies had indicated that a potential function for PKC&#x003b5; might be to regulate quantitatively the intracellular calcium signal initiated by PGF<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; on one of its luteal targets, the steroidogenic cells. The present studies validate the effective and specific down-regulation of PKC&#x003b5; by siRNA technology and provide strong evidence about the function of this PKC isozyme in luteal physiology. The data support the overall hypothesis that down-regulating expression of PKC&#x003b5; reduces the effectiveness of PGF<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; in reducing progesterone synthesis/secretion. This observation extends the report that when PKC&#x003b5; was inhibited with PKC&#x003b5;-specific inhibitors, the PGF<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; &#x02013; induced rise in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]i was decreased in LLC and SLC and that this in turn had consequences (at least in part) in the ability of PGF<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; to inhibit LH-stimulated P4 secretion at this developmental stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. As previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], LH induced an increase in the amount of P4 secretion. Interestingly, in the group where PKC&#x003b5; expression was down -regulated, the inhibitory effect of PGF<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; on LH-stimulated P4 secretion was significantly mitigated (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). This observation has an important physiological corollary: both PGF<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1;-receptors and PKC&#x003b5; are expressed in the same luteal cell type. Therefore, the isozyme PKC&#x003b5; has an important compatible time (mid-luteal phase) and place (small and large luteal steroidogenic cells) of expression, for it to have a role in the luteal transition from resistance to sensitivity to luteolytic actions of PGF<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1;. Furthermore, if PKC&#x003b5; expression is down -regulated (this study) or if its activation is inhibited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], the anti-steroidogenic effect of PGF<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; on LH-stimulated P4 secretion is impaired.</p><p>Experiment 2 also tested the hypothesis that down-regulating PKC&#x003b5; could influence the expression of key PG metabolizing enzymes that, in turn, could influence the balance of PG production from luteo-protective or luteotrophic to luteolytic. The mechanism for luteal resistance is not exactly known. However there is now evidence that regulation of key PG metabolizing enzymes observed during physiological states in which the life span of the CL is modified is likely to play an important role in this complex process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. The selection of the examined genes was based on the available evidence that, because of their key positions in the PG biosynthetic pathway, these genes have been shown to determine the accumulation of luteolytic or luteotrophic classes of PG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. For example, we examined the effects of down-regulating PKC&#x003b5; on the expression of PGE<sub>2 </sub>and F synthases because of their more direct effect on determining whether PGH2 is metabolized to PGE<sub>2 </sub>or PGF<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1;. The results obtained were unexpected; the prediction was that because of low expression of PKC&#x003b5;, exogenous PGF<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; would not be able to induce high increases in the cytosolic concentration of calcium, and consequently, the expression of PGE<sub>2 </sub>synthase/PGF<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; synthase ratio would favor PGE<sub>2 </sub>synthesis. The above conditions would favor luteal function. However, it is worth pointing out the importance of looking beyond steady states of mRNA encoding these enzymes; sometimes regulation may be at the level of protein or even enzyme activity and additional work is necessary before rejecting the tested hypothesis.</p><p>The developmental significance of a regulatory role played by cytosolic calcium concentrations in mediating the inhibitory actions of PGF<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; is documented by results obtained in experiment 3. As reported in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], PGF<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; reduced LH-stimulated P4 secretion in Day-10 cells only. Basal P4 secretion was not affected by the PGF<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1;-treatment at any of the two developmental stages tested. As the working hypothesis predicted, the pharmacological increase in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]i induced by A23187 effectively mimicked the inhibitory effect of PGF<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; in Day -10 steroidogenic cells. Furthermore, as predicted by the working hypothesis, the A23187 treatment also inhibited LH-stimulated P4 secretion in Day -4 steroidogenic cells. This inhibitory effect of A23187 is most likely due to its demonstrated effect in increasing the intracellular concentration of calcium ions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] in these cells and not due to other non-specific effects. This interpretation is also supported by the observation that treatment with A23187 had no negative effect on basal P4 secretion at any of the two developmental stages tested.</p><p>Further support for the significance of a regulatory role played by the increase in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]i in mediating the inhibitory actions of PGF<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; is documented by results obtained in experiment 3 where the cytoplasmic calcium buffering capacity of the cells was increased by Bapta-AM. At lower concentrations (0.1 and 1.0 &#x003bc;mol), the calcium buffering capacity of Bapta-AM was, most likely, at values that still allowed a PGF<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1;-stimulated increase in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]i; which in turn, preserved the ability of PGF<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; to inhibit LH-stimulated P4 secretion (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). However, as the calcium buffering capacity in the cytoplasm of the steroidogenic cells was increased by increasing the concentration of Bapta-AM (10 and 100 &#x003bc;mol), the calcium signaling feature of activating the PGF<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; receptors was most likely eliminated or at least reduced, and consequently, the ability of PGF<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; to inhibit LH-stimulated P<sub>4 </sub>secretion was also significantly reduced (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Similar effects of Bapta-AM on basal and hormonal-stimulated steroidogenesis have been reported in MA-10 Leydig cells (34). Therefore, the results of experiment 3 stress the calcium requirement for PGF<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; to inhibit LH-stimulated P<sub>4 </sub>secretion in the mid-phase CL and support the reported observation that the lower efficacy of PGF<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; to inhibit P<sub>4 </sub>secretion in the early CL is related to the reduced ability of PGF<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; to increase the cytoplasmic concentration of calcium at this developmental stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Taken together, the results obtained in the A23187 and Bapta-AM experiments, strongly support the proposed hypothesis that an attenuation of the luteolytic actions of PGF<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; is associated with a compromise in the ability of PGF<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; to induce a rise in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]i [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Therefore these studies provide a strong linkage between the signal transduction utilized by the PGF<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; receptor at different developmental stages and quantitative aspects of the known intracellular mediator of PGF<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; actions in the CL, [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]i. In this regard, species differences do exist, as in rat luteal cells the antigonadotropic action of PGF<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; is not mediated by elevated cytosolic calcium levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. It appears that the bovine CL therefore, has the following commonalities with human CL: 1) in both species, PGF<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; is luteolysin, 2) the luteolytic effect of PGF<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; appears only during mid- and late-luteal phase, and 3) in both, the humans and cows, changes in intracellular calcium appear to regulate luteal function ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>] and this study).</p><p>In summary, the evidence presented here strongly supports the idea that PKC&#x003b5;, an isozyme highly expressed in steroidogenic luteal cells with acquired luteolytic response to PGF<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1;, has an important regulatory role in the ability of PGF<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; to inhibit LH-stimulated P4 secretion in vitro at this developmental stage. The data presented strongly support the hypothesis that luteal resistance to the luteolytic actions of PGF<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; is associated with a compromised ability of PGF<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; to induce a rise in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]i. If the PGF<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; receptor and its associated signal transduction is bypassed with a pharmacological agent to increase the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]i, the LH-stimulated P4 secretion in Day -4 steroidogenic cells is eliminated, an action that cannot be induced by PGF<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; at this developmental stage. Conversely, if the increase in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]i typically induced by PGF<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; on Day-10 steroidogenic luteal cells is buffered by a pharmacological agent, then the ability of PGF<sub>2</sub>&#x003b1; to inhibit the LH-stimulated P4 secretion is abrogated.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>MPG and AS made equal contributions to this study.
