This enzyme belongs to the membrane-associated proteins in eicosanoid and glutathione metabolism (MAPEG) family of integral membrane proteins, and because of its link to inflammatory conditions and preferential coupling to cyclooxygenase 2, it has received considerable attention as a drug target. Based on the high resolution crystal structure of human leukotriene C<sub>4</sub> synthase, a model of mPGES-1 has been constructed in which the tripeptide co-substrate glutathione is bound in a horseshoe-shaped conformation with its thiol group positioned in close proximity to Arg-126. Mutation of Arg-126 into an Ala or Gln strongly reduces the enzyme's prostaglandin E synthase activity (85&#x02013;95%), whereas mutation of a neighboring Arg-122 does not have any significant effect. Interestingly, R126A and R126Q mPGES-1 exhibit a novel, glutathione-dependent, reductase activity, which allows conversion of prostaglandin H<sub>2</sub> into prostaglandin F<sub>2&#x003b1;</sub>. Our data show that Arg-126 is a catalytic residue in mPGES-1 and suggest that MAPEG enzymes share significant structural components of their active sites.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><label>*</label><p>The work was supported by <grant-sponsor>Swedish Research Council</grant-sponsor> Grants <grant-num>10350</grant-num>, <grant-num>20854</grant-num>, <grant-sponsor>Linn&#x000e9;us</grant-sponsor> Grant <grant-num>CERIC</grant-num>, and <grant-num>2001-2553</grant-num>, the <grant-sponsor>CIDaT consortium</grant-sponsor> (Vinnova), the <grant-sponsor>S&#x000f6;derberg Foundation</grant-sponsor>, and <grant-sponsor>European Commission FP6</grant-sponsor> Grant <grant-num>LSHM-CT-2004-005033</grant-num>.

Biosynthesis of PGE<sub>2</sub> proceeds from arachidonic acid, which is converted to the unstable endoperoxide, prostaglandin H<sub>2</sub>, by cyclooxygenase type 1 and 2. PGH<sub>2</sub> is further isomerized into PGE<sub>2</sub> by three distinct enzymes, cytosolic PGE synthase, microsomal PGE synthase type 1 (mPGES-1), and microsomal PGE synthase type 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>). Although cytosolic PGE synthase and microsomal PGE synthase type 2 seem to provide a basal synthesis of PGE<sub>2</sub>, mPGES-1 appears to account for PGE<sub>2</sub> synthesis under proinflammatory conditions. Thus, mPGES-1 is up-regulated by mitogens and cytokines and is functionally coupled to cyclooxygenase type 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>). Due to its key role in PGE<sub>2</sub> synthesis, mPGES-1 has attracted attention as a potential drug target in the areas of inflammation, pain, fever, and cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>).</p><p>mPGES-1 is a member of the MAPEG superfamily of enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>), which also includes two key proteins in the leukotriene cascade, viz. 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein and leukotriene C<sub>4</sub> synthase (LTC4S). Since all MAPEG members are integral membrane proteins, structural information on this family has been scarce. Recently, however, significant progress has been made in this area, and several high and low resolution structures have been solved by three-dimensional as well as two-dimensional crystallography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>). The crystal structures of human LTC4S clearly provided the most detailed structural information, <italic>inter alia</italic> a unique, horse-shoe shaped binding conformation of GSH, a hydrophobic crevice presumably binding the lipid substrate leukotriene A<sub>4</sub>, and an Arg residue, possibly involved in the activation of the GSH thiol. Here we used a homology model, based on the LTC4S structure, and site-directed mutagenesis to identify Arg-126 as a key catalytic residue in mPGES-1. Our data are consistent with the notion that MAPEG members share a structurally similar binding site to accommodate a horseshoe-shaped GSH involved in different catalytic reactions.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><p><italic>Materials</italic>&#x02014;The I.M.A.G.E. clones were obtained from the Medical Research Council Geneservice (Cambridge, UK).

Since this enzyme is an integral membrane protein, information on structure-activity relationships has been scarce and essentially limited to a projection map obtained by two-dimensional crystallography, demonstrating a trimeric quaternary structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>). However, a rapid and significant progress in this area was recently achieved when the crystal structures of MGST-1, 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein, and LTC4S were reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>). In particular, the LTC4S structures allowed a detailed view of the enzyme's active center and revealed a hydrophobic cleft that accommodates the lipid substrate and a deeper pocket for GSH bound in a horseshoe-shaped conformation. In addition, an Arg residue seemed to be positioned for activation of the GSH thiol and formation of a thiolate anion.</p><p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>FIGURE 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Model structure of the active site of mPGES-1 and comparison with LTC4S.</bold><italic>A</italic>, co-substrate GSH in its binding pocket in the x-ray structure of LTC4S (<italic>right</italic>) and in the homology model of mPGES-1 (<italic>left</italic>). <italic>B</italic>, estimated distance between the free thiol group of bound GSH and residue Arg-126 in mPGES-1.

When compared with the structure of LTC4S, the lipid binding crevice appears wider (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>), as one would expect from the chemistry of PGH<sub>2</sub> as compared with leukotriene A<sub>4</sub>. The co-substrate GSH is bound in a horseshoe conformation, and Arg-126 has a position compatible with a role in catalysis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). In the primary structure, mPGES-1 contains two additional amino aids in the stretch Tyr-117 to Arg-126, as compared with LTC4S. This difference between mPGES-1 and LTC4S has been disregarded in the model, since the two residues do not appear to have any impact on the &#x003b1;-helical structure carrying Arg-126.</p><p><fig position="float" id="fig3"><label>FIGURE 3.</label><caption><p><bold>PGE<sub>2</sub> synthase activity of nonmutated and mutated mPGES-1.</bold> PGE<sub>2</sub> production when microsomes (&#x0223c;70 &#x003bc;g of total protein) were incubated in 0.3 ml with 10 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> PGH<sub>2</sub> and 2.5 m<sc>m</sc> GSH for 5 min on ice (<italic>A</italic>) or microsomes (&#x0223c;70 &#x003bc;g), after extensive washing to remove residual GSH, were incubated with 10 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> PGH<sub>2</sub> and 2.5 m<sc>m</sc> GSH or the indicated GSH analogue (<italic>B</italic>).

As a control, a neighboring Arg-122 was also mutated into an Ala or Gln residue, respectively. Microsome preparations from yeast cells expressing nonmutated and mutated enzyme were assayed for PGE<sub>2</sub> synthase activity. Nonmutated mPGES-1 converted almost all added PGH<sub>2</sub> (10 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>) to PGE<sub>2</sub> when incubated on ice for 5 min. However, when R126A or R126Q mPGES-1 were incubated with PGH<sub>2</sub>, a pronounced loss (85&#x02013;95%; <italic>n</italic> = 6) of conversion into PGE<sub>2</sub> was observed (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>A</italic></xref>). In contrast, R122A and R122Q mPGES-1 retained the activity measured for wild type enzyme.</p><p><italic>Exchange of GSH for Its Ethylester Is Compatible with Catalysis, whereas Substitution for a Thiolester Does Not Allow any PGE<sub>2</sub> Synthase Activity</italic>&#x02014;To gain further mechanistic information, we exchanged GSH for various analogues during the incubation with PGH<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>B</italic></xref>). <italic>S</italic>-methyl-GSH did not result in any PGE<sub>2</sub> formation, indicating that the thiol group of GSH is crucial for the reaction. Incubations with GSH-ethylester (esterified at the C&#x003b1; of Glu), on the other hand, did still result in some PGE<sub>2</sub> production (about 28% of nonmutated), which suggests that minor changes of the GSH binding conformation, at least near its Glu carboxylate, still allows a productive position of the GSH free thiol. These data support the proposed role of the thiolate anion as the attacking species of GSH during conversion of PGH<sub>2</sub> to PGE<sub>2</sub>.</p><p><italic>Mutation of Arg-126 Allows a Reductase Activity That Converts PGH2 into PGF<sub>2&#x003b1;</sub></italic>&#x02014;Interestingly, when microsome preparations containing mutants of Arg-126 were incubated with PGH<sub>2</sub>, we detected a reductase activity rather than an isomerase activity, such that PGF<sub>2&#x003b1;</sub> appeared as the major product in the gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis (Figs. <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref> and <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">5<italic>A</italic></xref>). Both R126A and R126Q mPGES-1 converted PGH<sub>2</sub> to PGF<sub>2&#x003b1;</sub>, a prostanoid with a distinct spectrum of bioactions, different from those of PGE<sub>2</sub>. This reductase activity also required the presence of GSH and its free thiol, as assessed from incubations with GSH and <italic>S</italic>-methyl-GSH (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>B</italic></xref>).</p><p><italic>Putative Mechanism of mPGES-1</italic>&#x02014;Conversion of PGH<sub>2</sub> into PGE<sub>2</sub> by mPGES-1 is GSH-dependent and involves cleavage of the endoperoxide O&#x02013;O bond and elimination of the C-9 hydrogen as a proton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>). The mechanism of this conversion may involve glutathione thiolate as a base in the deprotonation step. Alternatively, it has been suggested that glutathione thiolate attacks the C-9 carbon to produce a thiohemiketal intermediate, which spontaneously rearranges to PGE<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>). A third possibility would involve attack by glutathione thiolate on the C-9 endoperoxide oxygen, forming a mixed sulfide. Subsequent deprotonation at C-9 and cleavage of the O&#x02013;S bond would lead to the formation of PGE<sub>2</sub> and regeneration of the glutathione thiolate (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). It is noteworthy that the mixed sulfide intermediate of this mechanism would be prone to reduction (<italic>e.g.</italic> it could be attacked by a second glutathione thiolate to produce PGF<sub>2&#x003b1;</sub> and oxidized glutathione) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). In light of our present data, it seems possible that an important function of the active site amino acid structure of mPGES-1 is to prevent such reduction from taking place and that the Arg-126 mutants are defective in this respect and therefore produce PGF<sub>2&#x003b1;</sub> rather than PGE<sub>2</sub>. This notion is also supported by the structural implications of replacing Arg-126, as illustrated in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>. Both R126A and R126Q mPGES-1 leave more space around the GSH thiol group, thereby allowing for a second GSH molecule to approach in agreement with the observed PGF<sub>2&#x003b1;</sub> formation.

The identity of the amino acid(s) represented by <italic>Enz-B</italic> is presently unclear. Arg-126 is a candidate, but since R126A and R126Q mPGES-1 retained PGE synthase activity and also exhibited a GSH-dependent PGF synthase activity, other residues must also be involved in the activation of the GSH thiol.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="zbc0050962130006"></graphic></fig></p><p>From the crystal structure of LTC4S in complex with GSH, it was suggested that Arg-104 is critical for the activation of the GSH thiol and stabilization of the thiolate anion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>). Since our data show that mutation of the corresponding Arg-126 is detrimental for the PGE<sub>2</sub> synthase activity, it is tempting to speculate a similar role for this residue. However, the mutants R126A and R126Q mPGES-1 actually retained a very small, albeit detectable, isomerase activity and also exhibited a significant, GSH-dependent reductase activity, which is likely also to involve formation of a thiolate anion (Figs. <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). Hence, our data suggest that the primary role of Arg-126 is not activation of the GSH thiol. Further structure-function studies with crystallography and mutagenesis will hopefully clarify the precise role of Arg-126 and other residues involved in the molecular mechanism of mPGES-1 catalysis.</p><p><fig position="float" id="fig7"><label>FIGURE 7.</label><caption><p><bold>Model of structural consequences caused by mutations of Arg-126 in mPGES-1.</bold> In the homology model, Arg-126 (<italic>green</italic>, <italic>left</italic>) has been replaced by Ala (<italic>orange</italic>, <italic>middle</italic>) or Gln (<italic>violet</italic>, <italic>right</italic>).

GSH was found to bind in a U-shaped conformation, and, interestingly, the authors could not find an access path for PGH<sub>2</sub> to the bound GSH molecule, indicating that the protein was in a closed conformation and that dynamic changes, involving helices 1 and 4, occur at the active site during binding and turnover of the lipid substrate. A putative structure of an open conformation of the active site, with a critical Arg residue (Arg-126), was obtained through modeling against the crystal structure of human LTC4S.
