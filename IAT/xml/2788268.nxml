For example, Gregor Mendel used pericarp pigmentation in maize to verify his work on inheritance ratios in peas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008231-Coe1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008231-Correns1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. It was in 1869 when Mendel observed the F<sub>2</sub> segregation from a hybrid cross between two <italic>Zea mays</italic> parents that had colorless and brick-red phlobaphene pigmentation on the pericarp. Decades later, R.A.

Nearly a century later, the molecular basis for tissue-specific expression of <italic>p1</italic> alleles is becoming clear. The major exception is <italic>P1-mm</italic>, which unlike <italic>P1-vv</italic>, has escaped molecular examination for all these years. The variegated pericarp and cob glumes of <italic>P1-vv</italic> was shown to be attributable to excisions of an <italic>Activator</italic> (<italic>Ac</italic>) transposable element from a <italic>P1-rr</italic> allele <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008231-Barclay1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>.

Accordingly, the lack of cob pigmentation in the endogenous <italic>P1-rw</italic> allele has been attributed to the absence of this enhancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008231-Zhang2">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The basis for the pericarp pigmentation in <italic>P1-wr</italic> was examined by comparing its gene structure and DNA methylation levels with <italic>P1-rr</italic>. The <italic>P1-wr</italic> allele from the W23 inbred line was shown to have six tandemly-arranged gene copies, each containing a proximal promoter and coding sequence that share 99&#x00025; sequence similarity with the single copy <italic>P1-rr</italic> allele <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008231-Chopra1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>.

In both cases, <italic>P1-wr</italic> is hypermethylated as compared with <italic>P1-rr</italic>, however, the presence of a dominant epigenetic modifier <italic>Unstable factor for orange1</italic> (<italic>Ufo1</italic>) leads to a decrease in DNA methylation at <italic>P1-wr</italic>. The reduction in DNA methylation correlates with an increase in ectopic pericarp pigmentation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008231-Chopra2">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>A critical question pertains to how the copy numbers and structures of <italic>p1</italic> alleles influence their epigenetic states. In order to address this, we set out to identify endogenous alleles that had variations of the copy number of <italic>P1-wr</italic> &#x0005b;W23&#x0005d;. It was suspected that <italic>P1-mm</italic> might have multiple copies because the gain of pericarp pigmentation in <italic>P1-wr</italic> plants in the presence of a dominant modifier <italic>Ufo1</italic> can be variegated or mosaic. Examination of the gene structure revealed that <italic>P1-mm</italic> has a tandem repeat gene structure like <italic>P1-wr</italic>; however, it has a reduced copy number. We show that two gene copies are highly similar to <italic>P1-wr</italic>, while other two copies contain a structurally-distinct region in the second intron. Interestingly, <italic>P1-mm</italic> is also missing the tightly-linked paralogous <italic>pericarp color2</italic> gene, which is located over 100 kb upstream from the <italic>p1</italic> gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008231-Zhang3">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. Since it is known that tandemly-repeated sequences are prone to epigenetic gene silencing, we investigated whether <italic>P1-mm</italic> has an altered DNA methylation state. We show here that, as compared to <italic>P1-wr, P1-mm</italic> has a distinct DNA methylation profile; a distal enhancer, shown to be important for pericarp and cob pigmentation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008231-Zhang1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008231-Sidorenko1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008231-Sidorenko2">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008231-Sekhon1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, is devoid of methylation in <italic>P1-mm</italic>. Conversely, the region immediately downstream from the transcription start site is hypermethylated in <italic>P1-mm</italic>. These opposing DNA methylation modifications suggest that both transcriptional enhancing and suppressing epigenetic mechanisms are responsible for the unique expression patterns of <italic>P1-mm</italic>.

In agreement with previous studies, we found that <italic>P1-mm</italic> ears may have zones of entirely colorless kernels amongst the red variegated regions. The location of pericarp pigmentation was highly unpredictable and some ears completely lacked pigmentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008231-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Such an absence of pericarp pigmentation was unstable, as the progeny of ears with colorless pericarp expressed a range of variegated pericarp pigmentation. In the unstable stocks of <italic>P1-mm</italic> a relationship was evident between the pigmentation levels in different tissue types. For instance, the presence of pericarp pigmentation correlated with the presence of silk pigmentation. Similarly, the weak cob glumes pigmentation correlated with a low level of tassel glumes pigmentation. All of these tissues were pigmented in the self-red revertant <italic>P1-mm</italic> stocks (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008231-g001">Figure 1B</xref>).

Interestingly, the red cob pigmentation sectors often laid below kernels that had a uniform &#x0201c;silk scar&#x0201d; pigmentation pattern on the pericarps. Thus, the uniform pericarp phenotype correlated with red cob pigmentation. Conversely, variegated or colorless pericarp pigmentation occurred above colorless or very light pink cob glumes. These results suggest that a common mechanism affects both pericarp and cob glumes pigmentation; albeit the suppression of pigmentation in cob glumes is usually more pronounced.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title><italic>P1-mosaic</italic> Resembles <italic>P1-wr</italic></title><p>R.A.

The region of the tandem array of <italic>P1-mm</italic> that is most structurally unique could be discerned based on the presence of several <italic>P1-mm</italic>-specific bands (indicated with asterisks on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008231-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Particularly with <italic>Dra</italic>I and <italic>Bam</italic>HI digestions, the polymorphic region could be inferred. With intron 2 probe F8C, <italic>Dra</italic>I produces two unique bands of approximately 3.8 and 4.0 kb size in <italic>P1-mm</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008231-g002">Figure 2B</xref>).

These results indicate that structural difference in <italic>P1-mm</italic> reside within a 1.3 kb region downstream from a <italic>Dra</italic>I site and upstream from a <italic>Bam</italic>HI in the large (4.6 kb) intron 2 (see grey-shaded box in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008231-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). Gel blots carrying <italic>Kpn</italic>I digested genomic DNA also indicate that there are structural differences at this location. For example, in <italic>P1-wr</italic> &#x0005b;W23&#x0005d;, probes F15, F8B, and F8C are all contained within the same 7.7 kb <italic>Kpn</italic>I fragment. However, in <italic>P1-mm</italic>, additional <italic>Kpn</italic>I bands were observed: fragments F8C and F15 detect two bands of approximately 5.0 and 6.3 kb, whereas fragment F8B detects a single 2.8 kb band (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008231-g002">Figure 2</xref>). This suggests that <italic>Kpn</italic>I site(s) separate intron 2 fragments 8B and 8C in two unique <italic>P1-mm</italic> copies. One likely scenario is that these unique <italic>P1-mm</italic> copies could contain end deletions of the <italic>p1</italic> tandem gene array. The absence of the upstream-linked <italic>p2</italic> gene in <italic>P1-mm</italic> could be explained by an extensive deletion that also affects the 5&#x02032; end of the <italic>p1</italic> tandem gene array. However, to accurately assemble the structure of the unique <italic>P1-mm</italic> copies, their sequencing will be required. It is important here to re-emphasize that the expected band sizes found in the tandem array of <italic>P1-wr</italic> are also found in <italic>P1-mm</italic>, meaning that some copies are structurally similar to <italic>P1-wr</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title><italic>P1-mosaic</italic> Exhibits a Reduced Copy Number Relative to <italic>P1-wr</italic></title><p>The missing <italic>p1</italic> homologous bands in <italic>P1-mm</italic> indicated that some of the <italic>P1-wr</italic> gene structure is absent from <italic>P1-mm</italic>. Consequently, we considered the possibility that <italic>P1-mm</italic> may have a reduced copy number in its tandem gene array. To test this hypothesis, <italic>P1-wr</italic> &#x0005b;W23&#x0005d; and <italic>P1-mm</italic> genomic DNA were digested with <italic>Bam</italic>HI and hybridized with the distal floral organ enhancer probe fragment 15.

The 2.7 and 2.05 kb bands can be considered as internal DNA loading controls, showing that all lanes had equal loading except the <italic>P1-rw</italic> lane, which has a reduced DNA loading. We inferred that the signal intensity in <italic>P1-mm</italic> of an expected 7.7 kb band was much reduced, as compared with <italic>P1-wr</italic> &#x0005b;W23&#x0005d;. However, the intensity was only slightly greater than the signal derived from the single copy <italic>P1-rr-4B2</italic> allele.

The <italic>Kpn</italic>I restriction bands of 5.0 and 6.3 kb present in <italic>P1-mm</italic> and absent from <italic>P1-wr</italic> are derived from the two unique <italic>P1-mm</italic> gene copies.

In <italic>P1-wr</italic>, the multiple tandemly-arranged copies may similarly associate to direct heterochromatin formation. Evidence that supports this copy paring hypothesis in <italic>P1-wr</italic> was presented for a <italic>Mu</italic> transposon insertion allele called <italic>P1-wr-mum6</italic> that contains a <italic>Mu1</italic> transposon in the 5&#x02032;UTR of one of the <italic>P1-wr</italic> gene copies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008231-Robbins1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>. <italic>P1-wr-mum6</italic> exhibits ectopic pericarp pigmentation that was shown to arise from the increased expression of gene copies that were not interrupted by the transposon. Furthermore, the stable gain of pericarp expression in <italic>P1-wr-mum6</italic> correlated with the hypomethylation of a distal floral organ enhancer. Thus, disruption of a single <italic>P1-wr</italic> gene copy can lead to the loss of suppression of other wildtype copies, which suggests for a possible association between these gene copies.</p><p>In opposition to longstanding dogma in the <italic>P1-mm</italic> literature, our genetic and molecular data suggest that the characteristic mosaic pigmentation of <italic>P1-mm</italic> arises by a mechanism that does not involve active transposon insertions or excisions. Rather, the unique gene structure of <italic>P1-mm</italic> itself may influence its variable expression states. We showed that both <italic>P1-mm</italic> and <italic>P1-wr</italic> have tandemly-repeated gene copies; however, <italic>P1-mm</italic> had a significantly lower copy number and was missing <italic>p1</italic> homologous sequences that are predicted to be linked.

The absence of <italic>p2</italic> suggests a deletion 5&#x02032; at the <italic>p1</italic> gene in <italic>P1-mm</italic>. Such deletion(s) may have also affected the tandem array of <italic>P1-mm</italic> since two gene copies of <italic>P1-mm</italic> were found to be structurally unique from <italic>P1-wr</italic> at an intron 2 region. These unique copies in <italic>P1-mm</italic> may be truncated versions of previously functional copies that could have been required for stable tissue-specific expression patterns. It is possible that the unique <italic>P1-mm</italic> copies could be a source of aberrant transcripts that initiate siRNA-based silencing in a variable fashion to yield the mosaic pigmentation patterns. For example, a truncated copy of the tandemly repeated barley <italic>Mlo</italic> gene produces siRNA that functions to block the expression from wild type copies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008231-Piffanelli1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The location of the structural difference in the intron 2 region of <italic>P1-mm</italic> may be critical for governing its phenotype.

The DNA hypermethylation of this 168 bp sequence was correlated with the loss of cob pigmentation in an epiallele of <italic>P1-wr</italic> called <italic>P1-wr&#x0002a;</italic>. Therefore, the disruption of this region in <italic>P1-mm</italic> may lead to suppression of cob pigmentation that is typical of most <italic>P1-mm</italic> ears. Our <italic>P1-mm</italic> phenotypic association data also showed that the absence of cob pigmentation was strictly related with the mosaic suppression of pericarp pigmentation. Thus, in addition to cob pigmentation, the structural difference in the intron 2 region could have engendered colorless sectors on <italic>P1-mm</italic> pericarp. The mosaic pericarp pigmentation in <italic>P1-mm</italic> may reflect variable activity of a suppression mechanism associated with the presence of multiple gene copies.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Competing Transcriptional Enhancing and Suppressing Epigenetic Mechanisms May Be Responsible for the Unique Expression Patterns of <italic>P1-mm</italic></title><p>Nearly 30 years ago, Drew Schwartz proposed a presetting and erasure model for the expression of pigmentation in <italic>P1-vv</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008231-Schwartz1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>. Pigmentation in the kernel gown was immediately preset to a suppressed state; however the suppression on the kernel crown and cob glumes was not set until the subsequent generation. The suppressed state of the kernel gown in <italic>P1-vv</italic>, could usually be erased to a <italic>P1-rr</italic> state if progeny were sown from kernels exhibiting full crown pigmentation. Based on these observations, Schwartz hypothesized that the <italic>p1</italic> gene contains distinct cis-regulatory regions for kernel crown, kernel gown, and cob glumes pigmentation. We now know that such temporal, non heritable and tissue-specific differences in expression can all be explained by changes to the epigenetic state of a gene. More recent studies have begun to shed light on how the epigenetic state of specific regulatory regions of <italic>p1</italic> correlates with allelic expression differences.</p><p>Herein, we found that DNA methylation levels did not correlate with pericarp pigmentation levels of <italic>P1-mm</italic>. We showed that <italic>P1-mm</italic> plants with pigmented, colorless, or self-red revertant pericarps exhibited no difference in DNA methylation. However, the extensive DNA methylation differences between <italic>P1-wr</italic> and <italic>P1-mm</italic> would be predicted to affect their respective chromatin structures. In other words, the DNA methylation status of <italic>P1-mm</italic> may report for relatively unstable chromatin structure. Relative to <italic>P1-wr, P1-mm</italic> was shown to be both hypermethylated and hypomethylated, depending on which region was assayed. The DNA of <italic>P1-mm</italic> was hypermethylated downstream from the transcription start site, but was devoid of methylation at a distal floral organ enhancer. The opposing DNA methylation modifications at these distinct regulatory regions may respectively direct the placement of <italic>P1-mm</italic> in euchromatin and heterochromatin. Thus, for unstable <italic>P1-mm</italic> alleles, epigenetic enhancing and suppressing mechanisms may compete to dictate the outcome of gene expression and pigmentation.</p><p>The aforementioned hypothesis for the competition between <italic>cis</italic> regulatory regions is strengthened when the regions exhibiting DNA methylation differences in <italic>P1-mm</italic> are taken into account. In several studies, elevated <italic>P1-wr</italic> expression that results in pericarp pigmentation is correlated with the hypomethylation at a distal floral organ enhancer. For example, several <italic>P1-wr</italic> alleles that have pericarp pigmentation confined to the kernel gown are partially hypomethylated at this enhancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008231-Brink1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008231-Cocciolone1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008231-Robbins2">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>. Additionally, both <italic>P1-wr-mum6</italic> and <italic>P1-wr Ufo1</italic> plants that have ectopic pericarp pigmentation also exhibit partial hypomethylation in this region <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008231-Chopra2">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008231-Robbins1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, DNA hypomethylation at the distal floral organ enhancer has been suggested to be conducive to pericarp pigmentation. It was therefore interesting to discover that the substantial hypomethylation of the distal floral organ enhancer did not always correlate with the presence of variegated pericarp pigmentation in <italic>P1-mm</italic>. Such variability in pigmentation was not explainable until other regions of <italic>P1-mm</italic> were examined for DNA methylation. The DNA hypermethylation downstream from the transcription start site in <italic>P1-mm</italic> parallels results found for the <italic>P1-wr&#x0002a;</italic> epiallele <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008231-Sekhon2">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>. In both <italic>P1-wr&#x0002a;</italic> and <italic>P1-mm</italic> this hypermethylation was correlated with the suppression of cob pigmentation. However, in <italic>P1-mm</italic>, we showed that the suppression of cob pigmentation was correlated with the instability of pericarp pigmentation. Thus, the hypermethylation downstream from the transcription start site may have a suppressing affect on both pericarp and cob glumes pigmentation.</p><p>Hypermethylation has typically been associated with heterochromatin and transcriptional suppression, whereas hypomethylation is associated with euchromatin and transcriptional activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008231-Gehring1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>. In this model, the hypomethylation at the distal floral organ enhancer would report for the involvement of a mechanism that induces euchromatin formation and gene expression. Meanwhile, the hypermethylation downstream from the transcription start site would suggest for the involvement of a mechanism that induces heterochromatin formation and transcriptional suppression. The interplay between the unique gene structure and DNA methylation may have rendered <italic>P1-mm</italic> a rather recalcitrant target for the heterochromatin machinery. However, it is likely that chromatin states of <italic>P1-mm</italic> can become more stable though the continued selection of either heavy of light pigmentation levels in self pollinated progeny. For example, the <italic>P1-mm-H</italic> allele with dark mosaic pigmentation would be expected to have a more relaxed chromatin structure than the <italic>P1-mm-L</italic> allele that produces light mosaic pigmentation. The self-red revertant alleles may be the outcome of infrequent events, in which the chromatin structure changed so that the aforementioned suppression mechanism is no longer active. We conclude that mosaic pericarp pigmentation of <italic>P1-mm</italic> is likely induced by the absence or modification of some of its tandemly-repeated gene copies that were present in a <italic>p1</italic> ancestral allele. Such structural modifications in <italic>P1-mm</italic> may have led to the variable activity of the epigenetic silencing mechanism that in <italic>P1-wr</italic> stably regulates the suppression in pericarp tissue. This study paves the way for the future cloning of <italic>P1-mm</italic> and the further dissection of the epigenetic mechanism that governs its unique expression patterns.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title><italic>P1-mosaic</italic> Stocks</title><p>The mosaic and self-red revertant stocks of <italic>P1-mm</italic> were introgressed into <italic>p1-ww</italic> &#x0005b;4co63&#x0005d; by R.A.

RT-qPCR was performed in the ABI7500 fast real-time PCR system, using SYBR Green I (Roche, Indianapolis, IN) as the detection system and the default program: 10 minutes of pre-incubation at 95&#x000b0;C followed by 40 cycles for 15 seconds at 95&#x000b0;C and one minute at 60&#x000b0;C. Each RT-qPCR reaction was carried out in 20 &#x000b5;l volumes containing 100 ng of genomic DNA from each genotype, 1 &#x000b5;M RTF8B-1 primers and 2X SYBR Green I master mix. Real-time PCR oligonucleotide primers which located on the <italic>p1</italic> F8B fragment are designed to amplify a 60 bp fragment (positions 8299&#x02013;8359 of EF165349) using Primer Express 3.0 (Applied Biosystems). The &#x00394;Ct was calculated as follows &#x00394;Ct&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;Ct (<italic>P1-rr-4B2</italic>, <italic>P1-wr</italic> or <italic>P1-mm</italic>)-Ct (<italic>P1-rr</italic>) for each genotype. <italic>P1-rr</italic> served as a reference genotype because it is known to have one gene copy. Hence, the results for copy number are expressed in N-fold (N&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;2<sup>&#x02212;&#x00394;Ct</sup>) changes relative to <italic>P1-rr-4B2</italic>. Standard errors were calculated using three independent preparations of genomic DNA and three technical replicates for each genomic DNA preparation.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0008231.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Alignment of 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; cDNA sequences obtained form three <italic>P1-mm</italic> alleles with known sequences of <italic>P1-wr</italic>, <italic>P1-rr</italic>, and <italic>p2</italic>.</p><p>(0.04 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0008231.s001.doc" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0008231.s002"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p>Sequences of PCR primers used in this study.</p><p>(0.04 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0008231.s002.doc" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank Dr. Thomas Peterson, Iowa State University and the Maize Genetics Cooperation - Stock Center for the generous gift of <italic>P1-mm</italic> stocks.
