To extend this finding, we analyzed DC-SIGN expression on B cells that were purified from PBMC of 33 normal donors by sorting with anti-CD19 monoclonal antibody (mAb)-coated magnetic beads. Flow cytometric results showed that DC-SIGN was expressed on 7.9 &#x000b1; 1.8&#x00025; (mean &#x000b1; standard error &#x0005b;SE&#x0005d;) of purified, peripheral blood CD20<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> B cells (representative example, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020070-g001">Figure 1</xref>B, T0; cumulative results, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020070-g001">Figure 1</xref>C, T0).</p><p>We next addressed whether expression of DC-SIGN on this subset of B cells was related to a state of cellular activation.

In contrast, treatment with a combination of different concentrations of IL-4 and CD40L had a synergistic effect on expression of DC-SIGN and CD23 on B cells, with the greatest increase in the number of B cells expressing DC-SIGN being induced by stimulation with 1,000 U/ml of IL-4 and 1 &#x003bc;g/ml of CD40L for 24 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020070-g001">Figure 1</xref>D, top and bottom, respectively; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0020070-sg001">Figure S1</xref>B, bottom). This treatment was therefore used for stimulation of B cells in subsequent experiments.</p><p>Cumulative data from 33 normal donors showed that expression of DC-SIGN by purified, peripheral blood CD20<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> B cells significantly increased after stimulation of the cells for 24 h with IL-4 and CD40L (representative example, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020070-g001">Figure 1</xref>B) from a mean level of 7.9 &#x000b1; 1.8&#x00025; to 28.2 &#x000b1; 3.3&#x00025; (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.0001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020070-g001">Figure 1</xref>C).

B cells from five of seven normal donors (donors 1, 2, 4, 5, and 7) had large, 6.1- to 122.4-fold increases in levels of DC-SIGN mRNA, accompanied by an increase in surface expression of DC-SIGN (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-0020070-t001">Table 1</xref>). B lymphocytes from the other two donors (donors 3 and 6) had low-to-moderate, 1.1- to 2.1-fold increases in DC-SIGN mRNA levels together with increases in surface expression of DC-SIGN after stimulation.</p><p>We next examined whether HIV-1 infection altered the number of B cells expressing DC-SIGN in the peripheral blood of HIV-1&#x02013;infected persons, and the capacity of their B cells to respond to stimulation with IL-4 and CD40L. We found that the percentage of DC-SIGN<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> B cells in the blood of HIV-1&#x02013;infected persons with chronic HIV-1 infection who were antiretroviral therapy (ART) naive or those who had suppressed viral infection on ART was similar to uninfected persons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020070-g001">Figure 1</xref>C). However, expression of DC-SIGN was not enhanced on B cells from the HIV-1&#x02013;infected subjects on ART in response to stimulation with IL-4 and CD40L, whereas DC-SIGN expression was enhanced in B cells from HIV-1&#x02013;uninfected persons and ART-naive, HIV-1&#x02013;infected subjects.</p><p>Next we compared the level of expression of DC-SIGN to other surface molecules that are known to increase during B cell activation and that play an important role in the interaction between B and T lymphocytes. Flow cytometry analysis of purified, IL-4&#x02013; and CD40L-stimulated B cells for expression of DC-SIGN, CD23, the B cell signal transduction molecule CD22, and T cell co-stimulatory molecules CD58, CD80, and CD86 showed that there was an increase in coexpression of all of these markers with DC-SIGN at 24 h compared to 0 h (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.005; T0 and T24, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020070-g002">Figure 2</xref>A) or mock-stimulated B cells at 24 h (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05; unpublished data).</p><p>Finally, we determined the expression of CD4 and the chemokine receptors CXCR4 and CCR5 on B cells, which are the primary receptor and coreceptors involved in HIV-1 <italic>cis</italic> infection. Although a small subset of B cells from the blood expressed low levels of CD4, this marker was not detectable after 24 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020070-g002">Figure 2</xref>B) or 48 h (unpublished data) of stimulation of the B cells with IL-4 and CD40L.

Levels of HIV-1 p24 increased from undetectable, &#x0003c;1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>1</sup> pg per ml on day 4, to &#x02265;5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup> pg of p24 per ml on day 16 at the highest input MOI (i.e., 10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup>), and &#x0003e;1.7 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup> and &#x0003e;8 &#x000d7; 10<sup>3</sup> pg per ml at the lower, 10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup> and 10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup> MOI, respectively. Virus did not replicate at any of these input concentrations in B cells or T cells alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020070-g004">Figure 4</xref>B).</p><p>We next investigated whether expression of CD4, CXCR4, or CCR5 by B cells was related to <italic>trans</italic> infection of T cells.

Furthermore, this <italic>trans</italic> infection was not related to CD4, CXCR4, or CCR5 expression on the B cells. The fact that these were purified B cells from HIV-1&#x02013;negative persons indicates that HIV-1 immune complexes and other types of cells were not involved in this process.

To address this hypothesis, we first examined the relationship between DC-SIGN expression on purified B cells and uptake of HIV-1. Virus was expressed together with DC-SIGN in activated B cells after 2 h of exposure of the cells to virus as detected by immunofluorescent microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020070-g005">Figure 5</xref>A).

Thus, after exposure of IL-4&#x02013; and CD40L-activated B cells to HIV-1, the virus is associated with DC-SIGN<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> but not DC-SIGN<sup>&#x02212;</sup> B cells, and there is no alteration in DC-SIGN expression in these cells as detected by flow cytometry.</p><p>We next determined the role of DC-SIGN on B cells in <italic>trans</italic> infection of T cells by treating IL-4&#x02013; and CD40L-activated B cells with anti&#x02013;DC-SIGN mAb or two nonspecific IgG as controls, one with the same isotype as the anti&#x02013;DC-SIGN mAb (IgG2b) and the other of a different isotype (IgG1), prior to incubation with HIV-1 X4 or HIV-1 R5 and co-culture with T cells. The results show that pretreatment of B cells with anti&#x02013;DC-SIGN mAb inhibited HIV-1 X4 and R5 replication in the B&#x02013;T cell co-cultures, whereas pretreatment with the control IgG had no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020070-g006">Figures 6</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020070-g006">6</xref>B). Also, inhibition of HIV-1 transmission by anti&#x02013;DC-SIGN mAb was dose-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020070-g006">Figure 6</xref>C). Because T cells do not express DC-SIGN &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020070-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;, this virus-inhibitory effect was related to blocking of DC-SIGN on the activated B cells.

We treated activated B cells with anti-CXCR4 mAb or an IgG control, and showed that this did not inhibit HIV-1 X4 <italic>trans</italic> infection of T cells, whereas <italic>trans</italic> infection was blocked by pretreatment of the B cells with anti&#x02013;DC-SIGN mAb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020070-g006">Figure 6</xref>D).</p><p>Taken together, these results show that DC-SIGN expression on purified, IL-4&#x02013; and CD40L-activated, peripheral blood B cells is directly related to <italic>trans</italic> infection of T cells. We hypothesized that this process could occur during B&#x02013;T cell interactions in lymphatic tissues. In support of this, we found that DC-SIGN was expressed by 26.4 &#x000b1; 6&#x00025; (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 5) of single-cell suspensions of purified tonsil B cells (representative example, T0, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020070-g007">Figure 7</xref>A). In contrast to blood B cells, there was little coexpression of CD23 by freshly purified, tonsil B cells, but comparable up-regulation of CD23 and coexpression with DC-SIGN after 24-h stimulation with IL-4 and CD40L (T24, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020070-g007">Figure 7</xref>A). Importantly, <italic>trans</italic> infection of T cells was mediated by the stimulated tonsil B cells, as demonstrated by an increase in p24 levels from &#x0003c;1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>1</sup> pg per ml at day 4 to &#x0003e;3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>3</sup> pg per ml at days 8 to12 in the B&#x02013;T cell co-cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020070-g007">Figure 7</xref>B). Over 90&#x00025; of this virus replication was blocked by pretreatment of the B cells with anti&#x02013;DC-SIGN mAb. Thus, both DC-SIGN expressing blood and lymphatic tissue B cells can mediate efficient <italic>trans</italic> infection of T cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>HIV-1 Is Internalized in Activated B Cells</title><p>HIV-1 is predominantly found within cytoplasmic vacuoles in DC after binding to DC-SIGN &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020070-b003">3</xref>&#x0005d;. This could relate to different pathways of HIV-1 that are required for subsequent <italic>trans</italic> infection of T cells. We therefore conducted a series of experiments to assess whether HIV-1 was internalized by B cells. We first examined the physical association of HIV-1 with purified, activated B cells and DC by electron microscopy. As expected, no viral particles were observed in activated B cells not loaded with HIV-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020070-g008">Figure 8</xref>A). Activated B cells incubated with HIV-1 for 1 h at 4 &#x000b0;C had viral particles bound only to their outer surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020070-g008">Figure 8</xref>B). However, activated B cells exposed to HIV-1 for 2 h at 37 &#x000b0;C had viral particles internalized in vacuoles of the cell cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020070-g008">Figure 8</xref>C), with no intracellular virus apparent outside of vacuoles. Both intact viral particles and possible degraded virions were present in the vacuoles, similar to those observed after internalization of HIV-1 in DC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020070-g008">Figure 8</xref>D; &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020070-b003">3</xref>&#x0005d;).</p><p>To prove further that HIV-1 particles were localized inside B lymphocytes and not merely bound to their surface, we incubated activated B cells with AT-2 inactivated HIV-1 X4 particles for 2 h at 37 &#x000b0;C to allow internalization, and then treated the cells with trypsin to cleave virions still bound on the cell surface. The culture medium was removed, and the cells were washed and lysed. HIV-1 p24 contained in the wash supernatants and cell lysates was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Under these conditions, essentially all of the p24 was found in the whole cell lysate, as very little was detected in the cell culture supernatants collected after the trypsin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020070-g008">Figure 8</xref>E). To prove that internalized virus and not surface-bound virus was transferred from B cells to the T cells, we next performed a protease protection transmission assay. Cells were loaded with HIV-1 R5 at 4 &#x000b0;C (wet ice) for 1 h, washed, and then shifted to 37 &#x000b0;C for the times indicated prior to treatment with trypsin or medium (mock treatment). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020070-g008">Figure 8</xref>F, very brief proteolysis of the B cells that had been exposed to HIV-1 at 4 &#x000b0;C to inhibit virus entry and then shifted to 37 &#x000b0;C (i.e., 0 min incubation) prevented transmission of HIV-1 to the T cells. In contrast, proteolysis of the HIV-1&#x02013;loaded B cells after shifting to 37 &#x000b0;C for 30 min did not prevent <italic>trans</italic> infection of the T cells. These data support that HIV-1 was internalized by the activated B cells prior to transmission to T cells.</p><p>Finally, we examined the ability of HIV-1 to remain infectious in B cells over time, as has been shown for HIV-1 infection of DC &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020070-b032">32</xref>&#x0005d;. For this, we exposed activated B cells to infectious X4 or R5 strains of HIV-1 for 2 h at 37 &#x000b0;C, and then either mixed them immediately with T cells or kept them at 37 &#x000b0;C for 2 d before mixing with T cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020070-g009">Figure 9</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020070-g009">9</xref>B, B cells that were loaded with HIV-1 and cultured alone for 2 d could still transmit virus to T cells, although at a lower efficiency then when T cells were added immediately to the HIV-1&#x02013;exposed B cells. Taken together, these results indicate that HIV-1 was captured and internalized in activated B cells, where it remained infectious for T cells for at least 2 d.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our results demonstrate that activated B lymphocytes derived from peripheral blood and lymphatic tissue express DC-SIGN, and that these cells mediate HIV-1 <italic>trans</italic> infection of T lymphocytes. Evidence for <italic>trans</italic> infection was an increase of HIV-1 p24 from undetectable levels (&#x0003c;1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>1</sup> pg/ml) to &#x0003e;10<sup>3</sup>&#x02013;10<sup>4</sup> pg/ml after 12&#x02013;16 d of co-culture of the activated B cells with autologous CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells. The <italic>trans</italic> infection was not due to direct <italic>cis</italic> infection of the B cells, as virus replication was not detectable in B cells alone after exposure to HIV-1. Likewise, there was little or no detectable replication of HIV-1 after direct infection of T cells alone with the low input of HIV-1 used in our experiments. Expression of DC-SIGN by the B cells was associated with this enhanced HIV-1 infection of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells in <italic>trans</italic>. That is, treatment with IL-4 and CD40L, which are mediators of B cell activation by CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020070-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;, enhanced DC-SIGN expression on the B cells. A total of 80&#x00025; of the HIV-1&#x02013;infected B cells were DC-SIGN<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> by flow cytometry. This was supported by immunofluorescence microscopy analysis showing that DC-SIGN and HIV-1 were coexpressed in the B cell cytoplasm. Association of virus with a small portion of non-DC-SIGN&#x02013;expressing B cells could be related to expression of other C-type lectin receptors by B cells that bind gp120 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020070-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;. Most importantly, DC-SIGN expression by the B cells was required for <italic>trans</italic> infection of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells with both X4 and R5 tropic strains of HIV-1, as we could block essentially all of the <italic>trans</italic> infection by pretreating the B cells with mAb specific for DC-SIGN.</p><p>In further support of a central role for DC-SIGN on B cells in HIV-1 <italic>trans</italic> infection, we found that the number of DC-SIGN molecules expressed on activated B cells was similar to that known to be sufficient to sustain capture of HIV-1 and <italic>trans</italic> infection of T cells by DC &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020070-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d;. Notably, the mechanism of <italic>trans</italic> infection of T cells by B cells did not involve HIV-1 infection of B cells by the conventional, CD4-CXCR4/CCR5 pathway. This was supported by the fact that B cells expressed little or no CD4 and did not express CCR5. Moreover, although B cells expressed high levels of CXCR4, treatment with anti-CXCR4 mAb prior to virus binding to the B cells did not inhibit <italic>trans</italic> infection of the T cells. Thus, although other C-type lectin receptors are expressed on B cells and can bind gp120 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020070-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;, our results support a requirement for DC-SIGN in B cell&#x02013;mediated, <italic>trans</italic> infection of T cells.</p><p>HIV-1 was internalized by B cells as determined by resistance of B cell&#x02013;associated virus to treatment with trypsin, and predominance of virus particles in cytoplasmic vacuoles of B cells after binding to DC-SIGN.

Internalized and not extracellularly bound virus resulted in <italic>trans</italic> infection of T cells, which was demonstrated by lack of effect of trypsin treatment of HIV-1&#x02013;loaded B cells on their ability to mediate <italic>trans</italic> infection.

Stimulation for 24 h with IL-4 and CD40L resulted in an increase in the number of B cells expressing DC-SIGN (i.e., 28&#x00025;) and the level of DC-SIGN expression on the B cells. Approximately 80&#x00025; of the DC-SIGN<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> B cells in blood also expressed the type II C-type lectin receptor and B cell activation marker, CD23, which increased to 86&#x00025; after stimulation in vitro with IL-4 and CD40L. Activation of these stimulated, DC-SIGN<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> B cells was confirmed by elevated levels of T cell coreceptors CD58, CD80, and CD86, as well as increases in coexpression of the B cell signal transduction molecule CD22. Expression of DC-SIGN was not restricted to blood B cells, as we found that approximately 26&#x00025; of tonsil B cells constitutively expressed DC-SIGN, and that this increased to 39&#x00025; after stimulation of the cells with IL-4 and CD40L. Interestingly, our study showed that few B cells directly isolated from the tonsils expressed CD23, but that this number increased after stimulation with IL-4 and CD40L. Expression of CD23 on some but not all DC-SIGN<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> B cells could be related to differential expression of CD23 by B cells in distinct areas of tonsils &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020070-b036">36</xref>&#x0005d;, and a pronounced cleavage and shedding of soluble CD23 by activated B cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020070-b037">37</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Of interest is that there was a comparable number of DC-SIGN&#x02013;expressing B cells in the blood of uninfected persons as in those with chronic HIV-1 infection who were treatment naive or receiving ART. In support of these findings, although B cells can harbor HIV-1 in blood &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020070-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d;, we found that HIV-1 did not kill B cells or inhibit DC-SIGN expression within 24&#x02013;48 h of exposure to virus in vitro. Our observation that IL-4 and CD40L stimulation of B cells from persons receiving ART failed to enhance expression of DC-SIGN suggests a negative effect of ART on this process. This could be related to the reported inhibitory effect of protease inhibitors, which are common components of ART, on expression of DC-SIGN &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020070-b038">38</xref>&#x0005d;, and requires further study.</p><p>Expression of DC-SIGN on B cells suggests that it is operative in their normal function.

Quantification was performed by converting the geometric mean channel fluorescence (GMCF) into ABC. The kit contains five microbeads of uniform size coated with different amounts of goat anti&#x02013;mouse IgG (Fc-specific) on their surface that have different abilities to bind mouse antibodies (ranging from 0 to about 250,000 molecules). Both beads and cells were labeled with saturating amounts of FITC-conjugated, anti&#x02013;DC-SIGN mAb, processed, and analyzed by flow cytometry under identical conditions. A calibrating curve was derived from the bead samples using QuickCal (Bangs Laboratories). The GMCF of the samples was converted to ABC per cell by comparison with the regression curve generated with the beads. Samples were also evaluated for fluorescence intensity as expressed by MESF units, using the Quantum MESF kit (Bangs Laboratories). The kit consists of five bead populations having different levels of FITC fluorescence intensity. As described above, a regression curve was generated by plotting the GMCF of the beads against their known MESF using QuickCal. The MESF of the cell samples was then determined as described above for ABC.</p></sec><sec id="s4f"><title>Real-time RT-PCR measurement of DC-SIGN mRNA.</title><p>Total RNA was extracted from cells using Trizol (Invitrogen Life Sciences, Carlsbad, California, United States) according to the manufacturer's instructions, DNAse-treated (Ambion, Austin, Texas, United States) and affinity column purified (RNAeasy, Qiagen, Valencia, California, United States).
