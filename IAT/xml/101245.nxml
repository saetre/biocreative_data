In the case of the imprinted <italic>H19</italic> gene, a 2 kb imprinting control region (ICR) is subject to differential methylation, as it is methylated only on the silenced paternal allele. This region has previously been shown to act as a silencer element at the endogenous locus. The proteins that bind at the <italic>H19</italic> differentially methylated domain (DMD) and mediate transcriptional silencing have yet to be identified, although a family of proteins containing a methyl-CpG-binding domain (MBD), of which MeCP2 is the best characterised, are obvious candidates. MeCP2 can bind to a single methylated CpG dinucleotide through its MBD and also contains a transcriptional repression domain (TRD). The TRD interacts with Sin3a and histone deacetylases (HDACs) <italic>in vivo</italic>, forming a repressive complex. Here we show that MeCP2 is recruited to the <italic>H19</italic> DMD <italic>in vivo</italic> and can silence a reporter gene regulated by the <italic>H19</italic> DMD in a methylation-dependent manner. This repression can be alleviated by deletion of the TRD from MeCP2 or by inhibition of HDAC activity. These data indicate that transcriptional silencing from the <italic>H19</italic> ICR involves recruitment of MeCP2 and presumably an associated protein complex with deacetylase activity. This complex may also be recruited to the ICR <italic>in vivo</italic>, resulting in a compact, repressive chromatin structure capable of silencing the paternal <italic>H19</italic> allele.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Genomic imprinting is responsible for the parental allele-specific expression of a subset of genes in the mammalian genome. Silencing of one of the parental alleles requires DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf210c1">1</xref>) and chromatin structural modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf210c2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf210c5">5</xref>). A strong correlation exists between CpG methylation and transcriptional repression at a number of genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf210c6">6</xref>). However, the precise mechanisms by which these epigenetic modifications induce transcriptional repression at imprinted loci are poorly understood. In the case of the <italic>H19</italic> gene the paternally inherited allele is silenced. A 2 kb CpG-rich differentially methylated domain (DMD) upstream of the <italic>H19</italic> gene is essential for repression and a 1.2 kb region within the DMD functions specifically as a silencer element on the methylated paternal chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf210c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf210c8">8</xref>). The proteins that bind at the <italic>H19</italic> DMD and mediate this silencing have yet to be identified, although a family of proteins containing a conserved methyl-CpG-binding domain (MBD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf210c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf210c10">10</xref>), of which MeCP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf210c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf210c12">12</xref>) is the best characterised, are obvious candidates.</p><p>MeCP2 can bind to a single methylated CpG dinucleotide through its MBD and interacts with Sin3a and histone deacetylases (HDACs) through a transcriptional repression domain (TRD) <italic>in vivo</italic>, forming a repressive complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf210c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf210c14">14</xref>). The TRD is also capable of interacting with TFIIB, a component of the basal transcription machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf210c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf210c16">16</xref>), suggesting that it may also be capable of causing repression independently of HDAC activity.</p><p>In mice, MeCP2 is particularly abundant in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf210c17">17</xref>) and mutations in MeCP2 have recently been shown to contribute to Rett syndrome in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf210c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf210c18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf210c21">21</xref>), an X-linked neurodevelopmental disorder that is one of the most common causes of mental retardation in females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf210c22">22</xref>). These mutations affect the ability of the protein to repress transcription either by impairing selectivity for methylated DNA binding or by decreasing the stability of the protein <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf210c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf210c24">24</xref>). MeCP2 is required for normal post-natal neurological development in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf210c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf210c26">26</xref>). However, its role in regulating gene expression earlier in development is unknown and this role may be difficult to establish accurately because of possible functional redundancy amongst the MBD family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf210c27">27</xref>).</p><p>In this study we have investigated whether MeCP2 mediates transcriptional repression from the <italic>H19</italic> DMD. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) with an anti-MeCP2 antibody, coupled with PCR amplification of the immunoprecipitated DNA, we show that MeCP2 is recruited to the <italic>H19</italic> DMD <italic>in&#x000a0;vivo</italic>. Using a HeLa cell transfection assay we also demonstrate that transcriptional repression from the DMD is mediated by MeCP2 in a methylation-dependent manner and requires the TRD of the protein. Transcriptional repression can be almost completely alleviated by inhibition of HDAC activity. These data demonstrate that <italic>in vivo</italic> silencing of the paternal <italic>H19</italic> allele from the DMD involves DNA methylation and the possible recruitment, through MeCP2 and Sin3a, of a HDAC, which presumably acts to ensure an inactive repressed chromatin state.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>HeLa cell transfection reporter assay</title><p>Regions from the mouse <italic>H19</italic> DMD were amplified by PCR and cloned into the <italic>Mlu</italic>I site in the pGL3-Promoter vector (Promega), upstream of an SV40 promoter driving a firefly luciferase reporter gene, and sequenced to confirm integrity and orientation. The following PCR primers were used: full-length DMD, 4S (5&#x02032;-TGCCTACAGTTCCCGAATCACC-3&#x02032;) and 2AS (5&#x02032;-CGGCATCGTCTGTCCATTTAGC-3&#x02032;); 5&#x02032;-DMD, 4S and 2.8AS (5&#x02032;-GCTTTTCTGCTTTCTGGCATCG-3&#x02032;); 3&#x02032;-DMD, 2.8S (5&#x02032;-AGCCGTTGTGAGTGGAAAGACC-3&#x02032;) and 2AS; mid DMD, 3.1S (5&#x02032;-AACCGCCAACAAGAAAGTCTGG-3&#x02032;) and 2.6AS (5&#x02032;-GCTTCGGACATTGCTGTGGG-3&#x02032;); down DMD, 2.6S (5&#x02032;-AAGCCGCTATGCCTCAGTGG-3&#x02032;) and 2AS.</p><p>An aliquot of 2 &#x000b5;g of these DNA constructs was transfected into HeLa cells which were cultured for 20 h.

The firefly luciferase values were normalised against 0.2 &#x000b5;g co-transfected <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase reporter gene driven by a thymidine kinase (TK-Renilla) promoter, as described in the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System protocol (Promega). Each construct was tested in triplicate in each experiment, and the experiments were repeated a minimum of three times. The constructs were either unmethylated or fully methylated at all CpGs by incubation with <italic>Sss</italic>I methylase (NEB) in the presence of 160 &#x000b5;M <italic>S</italic>-adenosylmethionine in NEB buffer 2 (50 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl pH 7.9, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM DTT) at 37&#x000b0;C for 16 h. Cells transfected with TK-Renilla alone demonstrated no firefly luciferase activity.</p><p>To test the effect of MeCP2 expression, constructs were generated containing full-length human MeCP2 or MeCP2 lacking the TRD (residues 207&#x02013;310), designated MeCP2 &#x00394;TRD, cloned between the <italic>Kpn</italic>I and <italic>Xho</italic>I sites of the mammalian expression vector pcDNAI (Invitrogen). The inserts were generated by PCR from the plasmid Actin5C.MeCP2 (a gift of S.&#x000a0;Kudo). The Rett mutation, R306C, was introduced into the MeCP2 construct using the QuikChange mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). All constructs were checked by automated DNA sequencing. The Ezh1 expression construct (pKW2T&#x0002f;Ezh1&#x00023;10) consists of a CMV promoter, the Ezh1 open reading frame and SV40 poly(A) tail and was a gift from T.

The nuclei were crosslinked with 1&#x00025; formaldehyde (added from a 38&#x00025; stock; Sigma) at room temperature with gentle shaking for 15 min and the reaction was then quenched with 125 mM glycine (added from a 2.5 M stock). After 5 min further incubation at room temperature the nuclei were collected by centrifugation (5000 r.p.m. for 5 min at 4&#x000b0;C in a Sorvall SS34 rotor), washed twice in ice-cold buffer (2 mM potassium phosphate, pH 7.4, 0.15 M NaCl) and resuspended in 0.25 ml lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 140 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1&#x00025; v&#x0002f;v Triton X-100, 0.1&#x00025; w&#x0002f;v sodium deoxycholate) supplemented with protease inhibitors (0.24 mg&#x0002f;ml aminoethylbenzenesulphonyl fluoride, 1 &#x000b5;g&#x0002f;ml leupeptin, 1 &#x000b5;g&#x0002f;ml aproteinin, 1.56 mg&#x0002f;ml benzamidine, 20 &#x000b5;g&#x0002f;ml tosyl-<sc>l</sc>-chloroketone; all from Sigma). The nuclei were sonicated in an ice&#x02013;water bath to shear the chromatin with three 8 s pulses of 2.5 kV with a rest interval of 20 s; the resulting average DNA size was &#x0223c;0.6 kb (range &#x0223c;0.25&#x02013;2.0 kb).

Sepharose&#x02013;protein A beads (15 &#x000b5;l) (Pharmacia) were added and the samples mixed for a further 2 h at 4&#x000b0;C. The beads, with bound chromatin fragments, were collected by centrifugation (1 min at 13 000 r.p.m. in a microfuge at 4&#x000b0;C); the unbound fraction was retained for analysis by western blotting (see below).

The aim of this <italic>in vitro</italic> study was to analyse the direct effect of MeCP2 on transcriptional regulation from the <italic>H19</italic> DMD, which may not be possible with targeted mutations <italic>in vivo</italic> due to functional redundancy amongst the MBD-containing proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf210c27">27</xref>).</p><p>The full-length mouse <italic>H19</italic> DMD was cloned upstream of an SV40 promoter-driven firefly luciferase reporter gene (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf210f1">1</xref>A) and transfected into HeLa cells, which lack endogenous MeCP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf210c29">29</xref>). When unmethylated this construct (designated <italic>H19</italic> DMD) gives &#x0223c;2-fold repression over the corresponding construct containing the promoter alone (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf210f1">1</xref>B). Methylation of the <italic>H19</italic> DMD (<italic>H19</italic> DMD<sup>m</sup>) caused a significant increase in repression, which can only be partially attributed to direct methylation-mediated silencing of the SV40 promoter (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf210f1">1</xref>B). Co-transfection of a human MeCP2-expressing vector with the methylated promoter sequence alone did not mediate further significant silencing (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf210f1">1</xref>B, SV40 promoter<sup>m</sup> &#x0002b; MeCP2). This observation is consistent with the continued repression seen from a methylated SV40 promoter in MeCP2<sup>&#x02013;&#x0002f;&#x02013;</sup> cells, just as in wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf210c26">26</xref>), and suggests that MeCP2 does not mediate significant repression on the promoter alone. In contrast, co-transfection of the MeCP2-expressing vector with the methylated <italic>H19</italic> DMD reporter construct caused an &#x0223c;5.5-fold increase in repression of the reporter gene (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf210f1">1</xref>B), corresponding to &#x0223c;200-fold repression over the unmethylated SV40 promoter alone. Significantly, MeCP2-mediated silencing is dependent on methylation of the <italic>H19</italic> DMD, since no repression occurred in the absence of DNA methylation. The repression is also dose dependent, as shown by proportionate reductions in repression when 200, 100 and 50 ng of the <italic>MeCP2</italic> vector, respectively, were co-transfected (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf210f1">1</xref>B).</p><p>To examine the specificity of the MeCP2-mediated silencing we also tested the effect of <italic>Ezh1</italic>, a member of the Polycomb group of heterochromatin proteins, which has a role in gene silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf210c30">30</xref>). Co-transfection of a mouse <italic>Ezh1</italic> expression construct with either the unmethylated or methylated <italic>H19</italic> DMD construct caused no additional repression (data not shown). We also examined MeCP2-mediated repression from four sub-regions of the <italic>H19</italic> DMD (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf210f1">1</xref>A). In contrast to the full-length DMD, none of the methylated sub-regions exhibited significant repression when MeCP2 was co-transfected in this assay (data not shown), despite the approximately equivalent density of CpGs between all the sub-regions and full-length DMD (1 CpG dinucleotide every 30&#x02013;41 nt; see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf210f1">1</xref>A). This observation is in agreement with our previous <italic>in vivo</italic> studies, where methylation of a 1.1 kb segment from the 5&#x02032;-region of the DMD alone is not sufficient for silencing of <italic>H19</italic> in many tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf210c7">7</xref>), suggesting that the total number of CpGs is important for repression. It is also possible that the size of the region from the DMD, or its spacing relative to the SV40 promoter, are important for repression, as the sub-regions are all smaller than the full-length DMD.</p></sec><sec><title>Inhibition of HDAC activity relieves <italic>H19</italic> DMD-mediated repression</title><p>To determine whether MeCP2-mediated repression at the <italic>H19</italic> DMD requires the TRD of MeCP2, a deletion mutant of MeCP2 (&#x00394;TRD), lacking the TRD, was tested in the transfection assay.

The TRD of MeCP2 has been shown to interact with the co-repressor molecule Sin3a and HDACs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf210c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf210c14">14</xref>). To test whether the recruitment of HDACs to the <italic>H19</italic> DMD is responsible for repression from this control region in this assay we analysed expression of the transfected reporter construct in the presence of co-transfected MeCP2-expressing vector and trichostatin A (TSA), a known inhibitor of HDAC activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf210c31">31</xref>). TSA had no effect on expression of the unmethylated <italic>H19</italic> DMD&#x02013;SV40&#x02013;<italic>luc</italic> reporter construct (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf210f2">2</xref>B). However, repression of the methylated reporter construct in the presence of MeCP2 was alleviated by &#x0003e;95&#x00025; by TSA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf210f2">2</xref>B), suggesting that histone deactylation is the predominant mechanism of repression from the <italic>H19</italic> DMD.</p></sec><sec><title>MeCP2 is associated with the <italic>H19</italic> differentially methylated domain <italic>in vivo</italic></title><p>To investigate whether endogenous MeCP2 was recruited to the <italic>H19</italic> DMD <italic>in vivo</italic>, we used ChIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf210c32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf210c33">33</xref>) with an anti-MeCP2 antibody. The antibody we raised specifically detects MeCP2 in adult rat liver nuclei, where a single band is observed at &#x0223c;68&#x000a0;kDa, corresponding to MeCP2 (which migrates anomalously slowly, <italic>M</italic><sub>r</sub> &#x0223c;53 kDa), and in formaldehyde-crosslinked and sonicated chromatin (data not shown). MeCP2 is immunoprecipitated by the antiserum, but not by the preimmune serum. In experiments on both adult and neonatal mouse liver, a 0.5 kb region from the <italic>H19</italic> DMD (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf210f3">3</xref>A) could be amplified from the immunoprecipitated DNA (after reversal of the crosslinks), showing that MeCP2 was recruited to this region in both tissues (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf210f3">3</xref>B). In neonatal liver, <italic>H19</italic> is predominantly expressed only from the maternal allele and silenced on the paternal allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf210c7">7</xref>). The association of MeCP2 therefore correlates both with general repression in adult tissue and with repression in a tissue in which <italic>H19</italic> is imprinted. MeCP2 can also be detected by ChIP at the region upstream of the <italic>H19</italic> gene in rat liver and brain, but not at the ubiquitously expressed <italic>GAPDH</italic> gene in these tissues (data not shown).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>At the mouse <italic>H19</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>Igf2</italic> genomic locus the DMD upstream of <italic>H19</italic> acts as a <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory imprinting control region (ICR). The activity of the DMD is modified depending on its methylation status. On the maternal chromosome it is unmethylated and is proposed to act as an insulator, capable of disrupting the interaction of downstream enhancers with the <italic>Igf2</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf210c34">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf210c37">37</xref>). Conversely, on the paternal chromosome the methylated DMD contains a silencer element responsible for repression of <italic>H19</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf210c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf210c37">37</xref>). Here we show that repression from this silencer element is mediated by recruitment of MeCP2 and possibly an associated protein complex containing HDACs, capable of modifying chromatin structure.</p><p>Recent studies have revealed that in the <italic>H19</italic>&#x0002f;<italic>Igf2</italic> imprinted domain it is only in the DMD&#x0002f;promoter region of the <italic>H19</italic> gene that there is a correlation between DNA methylation, histone H4 hypoacetylation and transcriptional repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf210c3">3</xref>). Our data demonstrate that MeCP2 is recruited to the <italic>H19</italic> DMD <italic>in&#x000a0;vivo</italic>. This factor can facilitate silencing of a reporter gene from this <italic>cis</italic>-acting ICR in a transfection assay <italic>in vitro</italic>. DNA methylation is required for MeCP2-mediated repression and this repression is therefore likely to occur <italic>in vivo</italic> only on the methylated paternal <italic>H19</italic> allele (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf210f3">3</xref>C). Sub-regions of the methylated DMD are not sufficient to mediate additional repression when MeCP2 is co-expressed. As the 3&#x02032;-DMD fragment we tested overlaps extensively with the silencer region identified by deletion <italic>in vivo</italic> (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf210f1">1</xref>A), this suggests that transcriptional repression at the endogenous <italic>H19</italic> locus may be mediated by other <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors in addition to MeCP2. Different members of the MBD-containing family of proteins are obvious candidates for this role. Indeed, the existing genetic evidence points to some level of functional redundancy amongst these factors <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf210c27">27</xref>). While our study does not address the role of MeCP2-mediated repression from the <italic>H19</italic> ICR directly on the endogenous <italic>H19</italic> promoter, we have previously shown that deletion of the MeCP2-binding region at the DMD <italic>in vivo</italic> results in reactivation of endogenous H19 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf210c7">7</xref>). In addition, transgenic studies have demonstrated that the silencer region from the DMD is capable of repressing transcription both from the <italic>H19</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf210c8">8</xref>) and heterologous promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf210c38">38</xref>), indicating that the repression is not promoter specific but may be a consequence of promoter proximity to the <italic>H19</italic> ICR silencer.</p><p>The silencing mediated by MeCP2 via the full-length <italic>H19</italic> DMD in the transfection assay can be almost completely alleviated by inhibition of HDAC activity, suggesting that deacetylases play a major role in facilitating repression. The targets of this repressive deacetylation activity at the endogenous locus are likely to include the tails of histones located within or close to the <italic>H19</italic> ICR on the paternal allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf210c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf210c5">5</xref>; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf210f3">3</xref>C). It is known that at the endogenous <italic>H19</italic> locus the level of acetylation on histones H3 and H4 is important for gene regulation, as the silenced paternal allele is hypoacetylated and the expressed maternal allele is hyperacetylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf210c5">5</xref>). In our model, the absence of DNA methylation on the maternal <italic>H19</italic> allele would prevent binding of the repressive complex, facilitating acetylation of histones and potentially allowing the recruitment of factors necessary for transcriptional activation of the gene (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf210f3">3</xref>D). The existence of differentially methylated genomic regions at a number of genes exhibiting allele-specific expression will make it of interest to examine whether similar mechanisms of transcriptional regulation are employed at other imprinted loci.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkf210f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> MeCP2 represses transcription from the methylated <italic>H19</italic> DMD in a HeLa cell transfection assay.
