A key branchpoint enzyme is the T-synthase, which directs synthesis of the common core 1 O-glycan structure (T-antigen), the precursor structure for most mucin-type O-glycans in a wide variety of glycoproteins. Formation of active T-synthase, which resides in the Golgi apparatus, requires a unique molecular chaperone, Cosmc, encoded on Xq24. Cosmc is the only molecular chaperone known to be lost through somatic acquired mutations in cells. We show that Cosmc is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)&#x02013;localized adenosine triphosphate binding chaperone that binds directly to human T-synthase. Cosmc prevents the aggregation and ubiquitin-mediated degradation of the T-synthase. These results demonstrate that Cosmc is a molecular chaperone in the ER required for this branchpoint glycosyltransferase function and show that expression of the disease-related Tn antigen can result from deregulation or loss of Cosmc function.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used in this paper: CD: cytoplasmic domain; DSS, disuccinimidyl suberate; ERAD, ER-associated degradation; GalNAc, N-acetylgalactosamine; Gal-T, galactosyltransferase; GlcNAc, N-acetylglucosamine; HPC, human protein C; PNS, Postnuclear supernatant; TMD, transmembrane domain.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Metabolic pathways are commonly regulated at key steps termed branchpoints, in which several key pathways diverge from a single precursor. Such a branchpoint occurs in the biosynthesis of O-glycans of animal cell glycoproteins, in which the common precursor to all mucin-type O-glycans, N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) &#x003b1;1-Ser/Thr (Tn antigen), may be modified by one of several enzymes to generate different core structures known as core 1, core 2, core 3, etc. The core 1 O-glycan is generated by the T-synthase, also known as the core 1 &#x003b2;3 galactosyltransferase (Gal-T), which adds galactose to the Tn antigen to generate Gal&#x003b2;1-3GalNAc&#x003b1;1-Ser/Thr (T-antigen; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ju et al., 2002a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">b</xref>). This is a key precursor for all core 1 and 2 mucin-type O-glycans in vertebrates and invertebrates.</p><p>The overall pathway of mucin glycosylation regulated by the branchpoint T-synthase function is developmentally important because disruption of the <italic>T-synthase</italic> in mice is embryonic lethal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Xia et al., 2004</xref>). Alternatively, another branchpoint enzyme that utilizes the Tn antigen is the <italic>C3GnT</italic> (core 3 &#x003b2;3-<italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosaminyltransferase), specifically expressed in the GI tract, which generates the disaccharide N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) &#x003b2;1-3GalNAc&#x003b1;1-Ser/Thr. Disruption of the core 3 O-glycan biosynthesis by eliminating <italic>C3GnT</italic> in mice is associated with increased susceptibility to colitis and colorectal tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">An et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>We observed that some cells and tissues in patients with Tn syndrome or in some tumor cells lack T-synthase activity, although they have the T-synthase transcript, and express the Tn antigen, indicating a lack of branchpoint enzyme activity. In deciphering the regulation of the T-synthase, we discovered that the T-synthase requires a unique and apparently client-specific chaperone that we termed Cosmc (core 1 &#x003b2;3&#x02013;Gal-T specific molecular chaperone), which is required for formation of active T-synthase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ju et al., 2002a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">b</xref>). Thus, the expression of the Tn antigen in patients with Tn syndrome and in human tumor cells results from mutations in <italic>Cosmc</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ju and Cummings, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ju et al., 2008</xref>). These discoveries prompted us to explore the molecular nature of the potential chaperone function for Cosmc and its role in assisting the T-synthase in acquiring its active form.</p><p>Somatic mutations in <italic>Cosmc</italic> result in loss of T-synthase activity, apparently because of degradation of newly synthesized T-synthase via proteasome-dependent pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ju and Cummings, 2002</xref>). Cosmc appears to be specific for the T-synthase because expression of many other glycosyltransferase activities is unaffected by loss of functional Cosmc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Piller et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ju and Cummings, 2002</xref>), and the only consequence in terms of glycoconjugate biosynthesis in cells accompanying loss of function in Cosmc is an increase in Tn and Sialyl Tn antigen expression. However, the precise location and function of Cosmc as a specific molecular chaperone in T-synthase biosynthesis has not yet been elucidated.</p><p>In this paper, we report that Cosmc predominantly localizes in the ER and that the T-synthase is mainly localized in the Golgi apparatus. Importantly, Cosmc has ATP-binding activity that is consistent with its chaperone function for maturation of T-synthase. When the T-synthase is expressed in cells expressing a mutated Cosmc that results in loss of function or in insect cells that constitutively lack Cosmc, the enzyme aggregates and is subsequently degraded in the proteasome. Thus, Cosmc serves a unique function in the ER as the key posttranslational regulator for expression of the T-synthase and may represent a new type of chaperone functioning in regulating protein glycosylation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Human <italic>Cosmc</italic> and <italic>T-synthase</italic> are expressed coordinately in human tissue</title><p>To define whether <italic>Cosmc</italic> and the <italic>T-synthase</italic> are coordinately expressed, we examined expression using Northern blot analysis of multiple human tissue samples. <italic>Cosmc</italic> is expressed in all tissues examined (Fig. S1 A, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200711151/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200711151/DC1</ext-link>), with the highest expression in heart, skeletal muscle, kidney, liver, and placenta, which mirrors the expression of T-synthase (Fig. S1 B; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ju et al., 2002a</xref>). The coordinate expression of <italic>Cosmc</italic> and <italic>T-synthase</italic> in human tissues is consistent with a close relationship between these two proteins.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>Cosmc</italic> only exists in vertebrates and is highly conserved across species</title><p>Upon BLASTP searching in the National Center for Biotechnology Information database using human Cosmc, we identified Cosmc orthologues in monkey, cow, mouse, rat, dog, bird, frog, and zebrafish (Fig. S2, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200711151/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200711151/DC1</ext-link>). No orthologues were found in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> or <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. All Cosmc orthologues are predicted to be type II transmembrane proteins, with a short N-terminal cytoplasmic domain (CD) and transmembrane domain (TMD) and a large C-terminal domain (Fig. S2). Human and primate Cosmc both have 318 aa, and there is only a single amino acid difference at V191I. In contrast, rodent Cosmc contains 316 aa and has &#x0003e;95% identity to human Cosmc but has a 2-aa gap between positions 33 and 34. These 2 aa are located at the beginning of the lumenal domain, which we show to be the functional domain of Cosmc. Frog Cosmc is a 317-aa protein with a gap in the sequence at position 33 compared with human. Zebrafish Cosmc lacks 3 aa at the C terminus compared with human Cosmc, ending at position 315. Except for mouse Cosmc, which can act as a molecular chaperone for both human and mouse T-synthase, the functions of other Cosmc orthologues have not been tested.</p><p>Interestingly, T-synthase orthologues were identified in both vertebrates and invertebrates such as <italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>. Whereas T-synthase in some lower vertebrates has nonconserved N-glycosylation sites, mammalian T-synthases lack N-glycosylation sites. In contrast, invertebrate T-synthases, as in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ju et al., 2002a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">2006</xref>), contain multiple N-glycosylation sites, some of which appear to be conserved. Expression of invertebrate T-synthase in insect cells does not require Cosmc for active protein formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ju et al., 2006</xref>), which may suggest that the presence of N-glycosylation on invertebrate T-synthases may allow them to be folded in a Cosmc-independent pathway.</p></sec><sec><title>Human Cosmc localizes in the ER and T-synthase localizes to the Golgi apparatus in CHO K1 cells</title><p>To explore the subcellular localization of Cosmc and T-synthase, we prepared a C-terminal HA-tagged Cosmc (Cosmc-HA) and a C-terminal human protein C (HPC) 4&#x02013;tagged T-synthase (T-synthase&#x02013;HPC4). CHO K1 cells were transiently transfected with both constructs and immunostained with anti-HA and anti-HPC4 antibodies. Anti-HA staining revealed a perinuclear pattern of expression for HA-Cosmc, and a merge of this image showed colocalization with calnexin, an ER marker (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, A&#x02013;C</xref>). In contrast, anti-HPC4 staining revealed a punctate pattern for T-synthase that was coincident with the localization of &#x003b1;&#x02013;mannosidase II, a Golgi marker (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, D&#x02013;F</xref>). These results demonstrate that human Cosmc localizes in the ER, whereas the T-synthase localizes to the Golgi apparatus.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Localization of human Cosmc and T-synthase</bold>.

(G and H) Sucrose gradient subcellular fractionation. 293T cells transiently transfected with HPC4-Cosmc were harvested and homogenized. The postnuclear supernatant (PNS) was loaded onto a sucrose gradient. After ultracentrifugation, 16 fractions (&#x0223c;0.6 ml/fraction) were collected and measured for both T-synthase and &#x003b2;4&#x02013;Gal-T activity (G) and analyzed on Western Blot with anti-HPC4 and anti-KDEL (H).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jcb1820531f01"></graphic></fig><p>We also stained with Alexa 488&#x02013;labeled anti-HA (Fig. S3, green, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200711151/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200711151/DC1</ext-link>) and Alexa 568&#x02013;labeled Anti-HPC4 (Fig. S3, red) in the same cotransfected cells. Cosmc expression was perinuclear, corresponding to ER localization, and T-synthase stained in a punctate pattern, corresponding to Golgi localization (Fig. S3), which is consistent with the results from <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>. This result further demonstrates that Cosmc and T-synthase localize to different cellular compartments. To confirm the localization of Cosmc in the ER and T-synthase in the Golgi apparatus, we stained human 293T and MDA-MB-231 cells with rabbit polyclonal IgG prepared against peptides from human Cosmc and T-synthase. The staining pattern for anti-Cosmc was similar to that for anti-Calnexin (ER marker), whereas the staining pattern for anti&#x02013;T-synthase was similar to that for anti&#x02013;mannosidase II (Golgi marker; unpublished data). These results are consistent with our observations using anti&#x02013;epitope-tagged forms of Cosmc and T-synthase and further support the conclusion that Cosmc is primarily localized in the ER and T-synthase is in the Golgi apparatus.</p></sec><sec><title>Cosmc is in heavy membrane fractions corresponding to the ER and T-synthase is in lighter membrane fractions corresponding to the Golgi apparatus</title><p>To further establish the localization of Cosmc in the ER, we performed subcellular fractionation on sucrose gradients of 293T cells expressing full-length HPC4-Cosmc. T-synthase activity was mainly recovered in fractions 12&#x02013;14, corresponding to the fractions containing the Golgi enzyme marker &#x003b2;4&#x02013;Gal-T (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 G</xref>). In contrast, HPC4-Cosmc was recovered primarily in fractions 6&#x02013;9, corresponding to fractions containing the ER markers GRP78 and GRP94 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 H</xref>). These results indicate that Cosmc is primarily localized in the ER, whereas the T-synthase is primarily localized in the Golgi apparatus, which is consistent with the immunofluorescent data (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, A&#x02013;F</xref>). Some Cosmc was observed in light membrane fractions and may reflect a small fraction that shuttles between the ER and Golgi during potential retrieval, but this remains to be explored.</p></sec><sec><title>Soluble Cosmc with an engineered ER retention signal promotes T-synthase activity equivalently to wild-type Cosmc</title><p>To test whether the TMD of Cosmc was important to localization and function, we made two constructs: one encoding a soluble N-terminal HPC4-tagged Cosmc (HPC4-sCosmc) and the other encoding a soluble Cosmc with a C-terminal KDEL-ER retention sequence (HPC4-sCosmc-KDEL). Cosmc function is generally rate limiting for T-synthase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ju and Cummings, 2002</xref>). Therefore, we cotransfected human 293T cells with either HPC4-tagged full-length T-synthase alone or in addition to the Cosmc constructs. Endogenous T-synthase activity was only slightly promoted by HPC4-sCosmc, whereas coexpression with the HPC4-sCosmc-KDEL significantly increased T-synthase activity (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). The HPC4-sCosmc was mainly secreted into the media, whereas HPC4-sCosmc-KDEL was mainly retained in cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, B and C</xref>). These results show that in the absence of the CD, TMD, and an ER retention signal, Cosmc is secreted from cells. The slight promotion of T-synthase activity by HPC4-sCosmc may result from the small amount of protein that transiently resides in the ER during its biosynthesis. Importantly, both HPC4-sCosmc and HPC4-sCosmc-KDEL were functional in insect cells in rescuing T-synthase activity (unpublished data). As a control, we coexpressed T-synthase with sCosmc lacking its engineered signal sequence. That form of the protein, which would be expected to remain in the cytosol, had no effect on T-synthase activity either in mammalian cells or insect cells (unpublished data). Together, these results show that the CD and TMD of Cosmc are important for ER retention but are not important in chaperone function and that a C-terminal KDEL retention signal is as effective as the full-length protein in its chaperone function toward T-synthase.</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>KDEL-tagged soluble form of Cosmc functions as wtCosmc and localizes in ER.</bold> (A&#x02013;C) Function of KDEL-tagged soluble form of Cosmc. 293T cells were transiently transfected with plasmids encoding T-synthase&#x02013;HPC4, HPC4-sCosmc, HPC4-sCosmc-KDEL, and wtCosmc.

The HPC4-sCosmc-KDEL was expressed in a perinuclear pattern that generally overlapped that of the ER marker calnexin, a transmembrane protein (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, D&#x02013;F</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Wada et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bergeron et al., 1994</xref>). Some lack of overlap in HPC4-sCosmc-KDEL expression and calnexin could result from the fact that the HPC4-sCosmc-KDEL is soluble, and some escapes to the Golgi and is secreted to media (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>).</p><p>Cosmc contains a single potential site of N-glycosylation in its extreme C terminus at N313. Thus, we examined whether Cosmc was N-glycosylated. About one-third of HPC4-sCosmc and HPC4-sCosmc-KDEL were N-glycosylated (unpublished data), based on sensitivity to Peptidyl N-glycanase F, an enzyme that removes N-glycans. However, the normal transmembrane form of Cosmc was not detectably N-glycosylated because there was no change of electrophoretic mobility upon treatment with Peptidyl N-glycanase F (unpublished data). Inefficient N-glycosylation of Cosmc may result from the fact that the potential N-glycosylation site is very close to the C terminus and is surrounded by acidic amino acids, which can impair the efficiency of N-glycosylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Whitley et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Nilsson and von Heijne, 2000</xref>).</p><p>To test whether N-glycosylation might be important to Cosmc function, we eliminated the N-glycosylation sequon by substitution of N313 to Q313 (N313Q-Cosmc). The chaperone function of N313Q-Cosmc was similar to that of the wtCosmc both in mammalian cells and insect cells (unpublished data). Thus, N-glycosylation of Cosmc is not required for its function, which is consistent with the fact that membrane form or full-length Cosmc is inefficiently N-glycosylated.</p></sec><sec><title>Cosmc itself does not have T-synthase activity</title><p>A previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kudo et al., 2002</xref>) indicated that the gene we initially reported as <italic>Cosmc</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ju and Cummings, 2002</xref>) possibly encoded a second T-synthase (termed core 1 &#x003b2;3&#x02013;Gal-T2), based upon some sequence identity (&#x0223c;22%) with T-synthase and apparent restoration of T-synthase activity in human Jurkat and LSC cells, which lack T-synthase activity. To clarify this point, we directly tested whether HPC4-sCosmc contained core 1 &#x003b2;3&#x02013;Gal-T activity. Cosmc lacked any detectable activity (Fig. S4, A and B, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200711151/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200711151/DC1</ext-link>), whereas the soluble form of T-synthase contained high enzymatic activity (Fig. S4, A and B). Thus, Cosmc is not a second T-synthase. This is consistent with our recent analysis of mouse null mutants lacking the T-synthase, in which all T-synthase activity in the homozygous animals is missing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Xia et al., 2004</xref>). Although Cosmc may have an evolutionary sequence relationship to T-synthase, Cosmc functions as a chaperone, and not as a second T-synthase.</p></sec><sec><title>Cosmc binds ATP</title><p>Many chaperones have ATP binding or ATPase activity, some with low affinity. Thus, we tested whether Cosmc has ATP binding activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Itoh et al., 1995</xref>). Cosmc binds to ATP-Sepharose and can be eluted with ATP, although the protein does not bind well (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>). In contrast, there was no significant binding of recombinant T-synthase to ATP-Sepharose. To further test whether Cosmc binds ATP directly, we performed photolabeling using 8-azido &#x003b1;-[<sup>32</sup>P]ATP. Under ultraviolet exposure, the activated azido group directly cross-links to the peptide bond in the ATP binding region of Cosmc. Purified Cosmc, but not T-synthase, could be photo&#x02013;cross-linked with 8-azido &#x003b1;-[<sup>32</sup>P]ATP. This binding is specific because it was significantly inhibited by excesses of cold ATP or GTP (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>).

Human recombinant T-synthase from LSB cell extract was enzymatically active and full length (&#x0223c;45 kD); however, T-synthase from LSC cell extracts was smaller (&#x0223c;38 kD), inactive, and there was a reduced protein expression (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>), potentially caused by truncation or cleavage of the peptide from its N terminus by an unknown protease. The low level of protein expression could be caused by either a low rate of protein expression or high rate of degradation. Interestingly, the <italic>C. elegans</italic> T-synthase, which does not require mammalian Cosmc, is expressed at equal levels recombinantly in both LSB and LSC cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ju et al., 2006</xref>). Therefore, to explore whether degradation was involved in reduced T-synthase expression in LSC cells, the cells were treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG-132. In the presence of MG-132, more full-length T-synthase was recovered, although it was still inactive (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, A and B</xref>). In contrast, the steady-state level of T-synthase expression in LSB cells and activity of the protein remained unchanged. The truncated N-terminal peptide in LSC cells could result in a soluble T-synthase, which might be secreted into the media. Thus, the media was Western blotted with HPC4 mAb. There was no T-synthase detected in the media from LSC cells; however, a substantial amount of soluble T-synthase was secreted into the media from LSB cells (Fig. S5, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200711151/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200711151/DC1</ext-link>). These data indicate that T-synthase synthesized in LSC cells is rapidly degraded by the proteasome because degradation was blocked by MG-132. Interestingly, truncated T-synthase from LSC cells was the same size as the soluble form of T-synthase from LSB cell media, suggesting that the truncation of T-synthase in LSC cells results from loss of the cytoplasmic and TMDs.</p><fig position="float" id="fig4"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p><bold>Characterization of T-synthase expressed in LSC cells containing a dysfunctional Cosmc.</bold> (A and B) MG-132 causes accumulation of full-length T-synthase protein in LSC cells but failed to restore its activity.

The fractions were collected and the activities of &#x003b2;4&#x02013;Gal-T and T-synthase in fractions were determined (C).

As controls, calnexin and 20S proteasome &#x003b1;1-subunit were also analyzed by Western blotting with their respective antibody (K and L). T-synthase was purified from LSC and LSB cells and Western blotted with anti-HPC4 (M) and anti-KDEL (GRP78; N).

To explore the localization of the inactive T-synthase in LSC cells, we performed subcellular fractionation using sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation. Both LSC and LSB cells were transfected to express human T-synthase-HPC4. Because of the low expression of T-synthase in LSC cells and less clear/organized images of the ER/Golgi in these tumor cells, we used sucrose gradient subcellular fractionation to localize Cosmc and the T-synthase in these cells. Subcellular fractionation studies, by Western blotting against the HPC4 epitope, showed that both the protein and activity of T-synthase from LSB cells were in the light membrane fractions (fractions 10&#x02013;13) as is the Golgi marker &#x003b2;4&#x02013;Gal-T (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, C and D</xref>). Interestingly, truncated T-synthase from LSC cells was recovered in the heavy membrane fractions (fractions 5&#x02013;8; <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 E</xref>), along with the ER markers 20S proteasome &#x003b1;1-subunit, GRP94, and GRP78 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, G and H</xref>). In addition, the full-length T-synthase from LSC cells treated with lactacystin was mainly retained in heavy membrane fractions, with a small amount found in the light membrane fractions corresponding to the Golgi (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 F</xref>). These data support the conclusion that Cosmc functions as an ER chaperone to assist the folding and/or acquisition of T-synthase activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Truncated T-synthase from LSC cells resides in the lumen of the rough ER associated with GRP78</title><p>The soluble, truncated, and inactive forms of T-synthase from LSC cells were recovered in heavy membrane fractions; however, they could be present in the lumen of the ER or associated with the cytosolic face of the ER membrane. To address this question, we treated the membranes with trypsin in the absence or presence of Triton X-100. We anticipated that the soluble truncated T-synthase in LSC cells might be associated with the proteasome on the cytosolic side of the ER. Unexpectedly, T-synthase from LSC cells, which was recovered in heavy ER membranes, was not cleaved by trypsin in the absence of Triton X-100 but was susceptible to trypsin action in the presence of Triton X-100 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 I</xref>). As expected, T-synthase from LSB cells, which is Golgi localized, was insensitive to trypsin in the absence of Triton X-100 but was quantitatively lost by trypsin treatment in the presence of Triton X-100 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 J</xref>). Calnexin, a type-I ER membrane protein containing a cytoplasmic tail of 87 aa, was cleaved by trypsin with a shift of &#x0223c;10.5 kD and retained the intact transmembrane and lumenal domains (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 K</xref>). In contrast, the 20S proteasome &#x003b1;1-subunit, which associates with the cytosolic side of the ER, was sensitive to trypsin (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 L</xref>). Similarly, calnexin and the 20S proteasome &#x003b1;1-sunbunit from both of the cell types were digested by trypsin in the presence of Triton X-100 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, I&#x02013;L</xref>). T-synthase from LSC cell extracts (in the presence of Triton X-100) was decreased significantly even without trypsin treatment, which might be caused by partial digestion by cellular (perhaps lysosomal) proteases. Collectively, these results show that T-synthase from LSC cells, which is inactive, is mainly retained within the ER lumen.</p><p>In spite of the data in the previous paragraph, T-synthase lacks any described ER retention signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gomord et al., 1999</xref>). Thus, we considered whether retention of the inactive and misfolded T-synthase in the ER of LSC cells might be a result of nonproductive association with known molecular chaperones. Many chaperones, such as calnexin/calreticulin and the UDP-Glc:glycoprotein glucosyltransferase system, retain misfolded N-glycosylated proteins in the ER and help them fold correctly. However, this system cannot function with human T-synthase because it lacks N-glycans. Thus, we tested whether the GRP78 or BiP machinery might associate with the inactive T-synthase in the ER of LSC cells. We conducted coimmunoprecipitation experiments in which the HPC4-tagged T-synthase expressed in LSC cells was purified, and this material was analyzed by Western blot to probe for coprecipitating chaperones. GRP78 was coimmunoprecipitated with T-synthase from LSC cells but not from LSB cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, M&#x02013;O</xref>). We did not detect HSP40 in this coprecipitation, but it is possible that it might be present because the antibody to HSP40 has low affinity. More comprehensive proteomic approaches will be needed to identify all the proteins that coprecipitate with inactive T-synthase. Nevertheless, these results show that inactive T-synthase in LSC cells is associated with a protein chaperone, but that association clearly cannot productively result in active folded enzyme.</p></sec><sec><title>T-synthase purified from LSC cells treated with MG-132 is partially ubiquitinated</title><p>The results in the previous section show that misfolded T-synthase is degraded by an ER-associated degradation (ERAD) pathway, which usually requires ubiquitination. To probe whether the misfolded T-synthase is ubiquitinated, we performed a Western blot using anti-ubiquitin antibody against the affinity-purified full-length HPC4-tagged T-synthase from LSC cells treated with MG-132. The gels were intentionally overloaded to enhance detectability of ubiquitinated species. No ubiquitinated protein was detected in T-synthase purified from LSB cell extracts with or without MG-132 treatment (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, A and B</xref>). In contrast, a portion of the inactive T-synthase from LSC cells treated with MG-132 was observed as high molecular mass species. Importantly, high molecular mass species from LSC cells in the presence of MG-132 were stained with ubiquitin antibody. These results demonstrate that a fraction of the T-synthase that accumulates in LSC cells in the presence of a proteasome inhibitor is ubiquitinated.</p><fig position="float" id="fig5"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p><bold>T-synthase expressed in LSC Cells is partially ubiquitinated</bold>.

The T-synthase from LSB cells, which have normal wtCosmc, appears mainly as a monomer under reducing conditions and as both monomers and dimers in nonreducing gels (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 A</xref>).

The T-synthase from LSB cells was mainly found in dimeric form in the presence of DSS (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 B</xref>, lanes 7 and 8). However, most of the T-synthase from LSC cells was recovered as high molecular mass aggregates in the presence of DSS (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 B</xref>, lanes 3 and 4). To confirm these results, we explored the oligomeric state of T-synthase generated in an insect expression system, which lacks a Cosmc orthologue. We examined T-synthase under reducing conditions in both intact Sf-9 cells and cell extracts treated with permeable DSS. In the absence of DSS or Cosmc, T-synthase is recovered primarily as a monomer in cells and extracts (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 C</xref>, lanes 2 and 7). When coexpressed with Cosmc, we also recovered T-synthase mainly as a monomer (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 C</xref>, lanes 4 and 9). In contrast, treatment with DSS of cells expressing T-synthase but lacking Cosmc coexpression resulted in a quantitative shift of T-synthase to high molecular mass complexes (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 C</xref>, lanes 3 and 8). However, coexpression of Cosmc and T-synthase rescued much of the T-synthase from cross-linking and a significant amount of T-synthase monomer was recovered (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 C</xref>, lanes 5 and 10). These results indicate that in the absence of Cosmc, T-synthase appears in oligomeric and inactive complexes, whereas in the presence of Cosmc, T-synthase appears as a monomer and dimer, demonstrating that Cosmc helps to prevent nonproductive oligomerization of T-synthase.</p><p>We also explored the effects of blocking proteasomal degradation on the oligomeric state of T-synthase in LSC and LSB cells. When LSB cells were treated with lactacystin, there was little change in the amount of monomeric T-synthase recovered (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 B</xref>, lane 9), and after DSS treatment of cells, there were increased amounts of the dimeric form, as expected because natural T-synthase is a homodimer, and a small amount of oligomers form perhaps because of limited endogenous Cosmc (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 B</xref>, lane 10). In contrast, treatment of LSC cells with lactacystin caused a larger increase in total T-synthase (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 B</xref>, lane 5), with enhanced recovery of high molecular mass aggregates of T-synthase in DSS-treated cells (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 B</xref>, lane 6). These results show that T-synthase in cells expressing functional Cosmc is primarily in active monomeric and dimeric forms, whereas in the absence of Cosmc, the T-synthase is partly degraded and recoverable in high molecular weight complexes, and no dimeric active forms of enzyme are present, indicating that proteolysis occurs in the context of the oligomeric complexes.</p></sec><sec><title>Cosmc directly interacts with T-synthase</title><p>Many molecular chaperones function to prevent protein oligomerization by directly interacting with their client proteins. To investigate the nature of Cosmc and T-synthase interaction, we purified soluble HPC4-tagged T-synthase and His-tagged Cosmc from Hi-5 cells and tested for their direct interaction in vitro. As a control, we used galectin-3, which would not be expected to bind Cosmc. After mixing Cosmc with either of these proteins, Cosmc was quantitatively captured by adsorption on Ni-NTA beads and eluted with imidazole. The input (loading), unbound, and bound materials were analyzed by Western blot with anti-Cosmc, anti-HPC4, or anti&#x02013;galectin-3 antibodies. Cosmc was quantitatively bound by Ni-NTA beads, whereas T-synthase did not bind to Ni-NTA beads (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7, A and B</xref>).

In addition, the Tn and sialyl-Tn antigen are recognized as tumor-associated antigens in mucins and other glycoproteins from many human tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Springer, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Nakagoe et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Schietinger et al., 2006</xref>). In examining human Jurkat cells that lacked T-synthase activity, we found that expression of the T-synthase transcript was normal but, surprisingly, active forms of recombinant T-synthase could not be expressed in cells. This led to our finding of Cosmc as a required molecular chaperone for active T-synthase formation and the finding that the X-linked <italic>Cosmc</italic> gene [Xq24] is mutated in cells lacking T-synthase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ju and Cummings, 2002</xref>). Thus, acquired somatic or potentially inherited mutations in <italic>Cosmc</italic> could account for the defects in core 1 O-glycan biosynthesis and expression of Tn antigen. We recently showed that mutations in <italic>Cosmc</italic> are associated with Tn antigen expression in patients with Tn syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ju and Cummings, 2005</xref>) and in human tumor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ju et al., 2008</xref>). Expression of the Tn and sialyl-Tn antigens in human tumors are associated with poor prognosis, including human breast carcinoma, and colorectal and esophageal cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Springer, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Nakagoe et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Schietinger et al., 2006</xref>). However, until now the nature of Cosmc function in providing active T-synthase was unknown. We originally considered that Cosmc might be a &#x0201c;subunit&#x0201d; of the T-synthase, but we found that purified active T-synthase from rat liver and purified recombinant soluble form of T-synthase from 293T cell media were fully active and devoid of Cosmc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ju et al., 2002a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">b</xref>). Thus, Cosmc is not a required cofactor or subunit of active T-synthase enzyme.</p><p>Our studies demonstrate that Cosmc is a resident ER protein that binds ATP, whereas the T-synthase is a resident Golgi protein. In the absence of Cosmc, the T-synthase is retained in the ER lumen and accumulates as an enzymatically inactive oligomeric disulfide-bonded complex associated with GRP78. Proteins that are misfolded are eliminated from the ER by an ERAD pathway, in which misfolded proteins are targeted for reverse translocation out of the ER, where they are ubiquitinated, and then disposed of in the cytoplasmic proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahner and Brodsky, 2004</xref>). The inactive T-synthase is subjected to degradation by the ERAD pathway, as indicated by the presence of ubiquitinated T-synthase, which accumulates in the presence of proteasome inhibitors. The ER retention of Cosmc requires its transmembrane and cytosolic domains because soluble Cosmc is secreted from cells. However, soluble Cosmc engineered to contain a KDEL ER-retrieval signal is retained in the ER and functions as a chaperone for T-synthase. Human Cosmc and T-synthase are coordinately expressed in human tissues, indicating the close relationship between these two proteins. Active T-synthase cannot be expressed without the presence of functional Cosmc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ju and Cummings, 2002</xref>). More importantly, purified recombinant Cosmc directly interacts with purified recombinant T-synthase (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). Thus, Cosmc is an ER-localized molecular chaperone that prevents degradation and aggregation of mammalian T-synthase, and the overall proposed pathway is shown in <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>. It is important to note that Cosmc itself does not have any T-synthase activity, which is in contrast to a previous study that erroneously concluded that the <italic>Cosmc</italic> gene encoded a second core 1 &#x003b2;3&#x02013;Gal-T (T-synthase) in humans named C1Gal-T2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kudo et al., 2002</xref>). The T-synthase activity is encoded by a single gene, which is consistent with our studies in this paper showing that loss of Cosmc function is associated with a complete loss of T-synthase activity, that deletion of <italic>T-synthase</italic> in mice eliminates all T-synthase activity and results in embryonic death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Xia et al., 2004</xref>), and that mutations in <italic>Cosmc</italic> are associated with loss of T-synthase in patients with Tn syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ju and Cummings, 2005</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig8"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><p><bold>Working model for Cosmc function.</bold> Human Cosmc is localized predominantly in the ER where it interacts with the nascent polypeptide of human T-synthase. Cosmc, along with other ER chaperones such as HSP70 (BiP)/HSP40 and protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), assists its folding properly. Native T-synthase, which occurs mainly as a homodimer, exits to the Golgi apparatus, where it functions in synthesizing core 1 O-glycans (T-antigen). When Cosmc is mutated and dysfunctional, the nascent polypeptides of T-synthase form inactive aggregates or oligomers, which are associated with GRP78 (BiP), and subsequently proceed to the ERAD pathway where they are retrotranslocated from the ER to the cytosol, ubiquitinated, and subsequently degraded by the proteasome.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jcb1820531f08"></graphic></fig><p>The T-synthase is not a glycoprotein and has no canonical motifs for N-glycosylation, which is in contrast to most glycosyltransferases. Thus, the T-synthase, unlike other newly synthesized glycoproteins in the ER, cannot interact with the known quality control systems composed of several lectin-based chaperones, such as the calnexin/calreticulin system, and other glycan-recognizing or modifying proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ruddock and Molinari, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Schroder, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Otsu and Sitia, 2007</xref>). The absence of such interactions may underscore the molecular function of Cosmc in specifically preventing oligomerization and inactivation of the T-synthase and provides the first specific evidence for the quality control of nonglycosylated protein folding in the ER.</p><p>It is interesting that although the ER contains many chaperones that can promote proper protein folding, in the absence of Cosmc these chaperones are not successful in promoting folding of the T-synthase. We found that GRP78 (BiP) could be coimmunoprecipitated with inactive T-synthase generated in the absence of Cosmc. GRP78 is known to associate with unfolded proteins in the ER to aid in their exit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kleizen and Braakman, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ni and Lee, 2007</xref>). The inactive oligomers of T-synthase accumulate within the ER in the absence of Cosmc and reside within disulfide-bonded complexes. We also found that Cosmc binds directly to ATP, thus indicating that Cosmc is a chaperone. In other experiments, when we purified the T-synthase from rat liver microsomes, which included the ER and Golgi compartments, we found that both Cosmc and HSP40 copurified in early steps with the T-synthase (unpublished data). Although this further supports a role for Cosmc as a T-synthase chaperone, it also indicates that HSP40 could be a cochaperone for Cosmc as it is for HSP70 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kleizen and Braakman, 2004</xref>).</p><p>In order for the misfolded T-synthase to be ubiquitinated by ubiquitination system, it must be retrotranslocated from the lumen back to the cytosol. However, little is known about the mechanisms of retrotranslocation for type II membrane proteins and how such unfolded proteins that accumulate in the ER are degraded by ERAD pathway. The degradation of T-synthase, the first identified enzyme with a deficiency in its ER chaperone protein that leads to disease, may provide a novel system to explore these pathways.</p><p>Thus, Cosmc represents a protein-specific quality control factor and joins a growing number of such chaperones in the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hendershot and Bulleid, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ellgaard and Helenius, 2003</xref>). Cosmc is not a T-synthase subunit, lacks glycosyltransferase activity, and, among glycosyltransferases, it is only known to associate with the inactive T-synthase. We noted that Cosmc does not associate with fully folded T-synthase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ju and Cummings, 2002</xref>), but it can be coimmunoprecipitated with a subset of T-synthase proteins, likely representing folding intermediates in the pathway to fully active enzyme. Most importantly, we have shown that purified recombinant Cosmc can directly interact with purified T-synthase. As expected, only a small fraction of recombinant T-synthase coprecipitated with purified recombinant His-tagged Cosmc, which could result from the possibility that only a fraction of purified recombinant T-synthase might be in unfolded state upon purification. This fraction therefore transiently interacts with active recombinant His-tagged Cosmc, supporting the fact that Cosmc is an ER molecular chaperone, but this issue will require extensive studies, including exploring the role of ATP in these interactions. Loss-of-function of Cosmc results in the formation of misfolded aggregates of T-synthase polypeptide, which would be predicted to be retrotranslocated back to the cytosol where ubiquitination occurs, and the ubiquitinated protein is then degraded in the proteasome, as shown in the model (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>). Overall, our study shows that Cosmc is a key regulator of the expression of functional T-synthase, which represents a novel mechanism for controlling a branchpoint glycosyltransferase in O-glycan biosynthesis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title><p>GalNAc-&#x003b1;-phenyl, UDP-Gal, GlcNAc-&#x003b2;-S-pNp, and ATP-Sepharose were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich.
