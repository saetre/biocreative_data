Here, we quantify the concentration of PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub> as &#x0223c;6 mol% in the cytoplasmic leaflet of plasma membrane microdomains at sites of docked vesicles. At this concentration of PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub> soluble NSF attachment protein receptor (SNARE)&#x02013;dependent liposome fusion is inhibited. Inhibition by PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub> likely results from its intrinsic positive curvature&#x02013;promoting properties that inhibit formation of high negative curvature membrane fusion intermediates. Mutation of juxtamembrane basic residues in the plasma membrane SNARE syntaxin-1 increase inhibition by PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub>, suggesting that syntaxin sequesters PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub> to alleviate inhibition. To define an essential rather than inhibitory role for PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub>, we test a PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub>&#x02013;binding priming factor required for vesicle exocytosis. Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-dependent activator protein for secretion promotes increased rates of SNARE-dependent fusion that are PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub> dependent. These results indicate that PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub> regulates fusion both as a fusion restraint that syntaxin-1 alleviates and as an essential cofactor that recruits protein priming factors to facilitate SNARE-dependent fusion.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used in this paper: CAPS, Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-dependent activator protein for secretion; DOPC, 1,2-dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine; DOPS, 1,2-dioleoyl phosphatidylserine; LPC, lysophosphatidylcholine; NBD-PE, N-(7-nitro-2-1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl)-1,2-dipalmitoyl phosphatidylethanolamine; PA, phosphatidic acid; PC, phosphatidylcholine; Pf, protein-free; PH, pleckstrin homology; PI 4-P, phosphatidylinositol-4-monophosphate; PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub>, phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate; PS, phosphatidylserine; Rh-PE, <italic>N</italic>-(lissamine rhodamine B sulfonyl)-1,2-dipalmitoyl phosphatidylethanolamine; SNAP-25, 25-kD synaptosome-associated protein; VAMP-2, vesicle-associated membrane protein 2.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub>) is a minor but key phospholipid mainly on the cytoplasmic leaflet of the plasma membrane that regulates a wide variety of processes, including exocytic and endocytic membrane traffic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Martin, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cremona and De Camilli, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ungewickell and Hinrichsen, 2007</xref>), ion channel and transporter function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hilgemann et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Suh and Hille, 2005</xref>), enzyme activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">McDermott et al., 2004</xref>), and protein recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lemmon, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Janmey and Lindberg, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Balla, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Takenawa and Itoh, 2006</xref>).

Several PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub>&#x02013;binding proteins potentially involved in stages of vesicle exocytosis have been identified, including rabphilin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chung et al., 1998</xref>), Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-dependent activator protein for secretion (CAPS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Loyet et al., 1998</xref>), SCAMP2 (secretory carrier membrane protein 2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liao et al., 2007</xref>), and synaptotagmin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bai et al., 2004</xref>); but it is unclear which of these or other proteins might mediate the essential role of PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub> in vesicle-priming reactions.</p><p>The physical properties of PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub> make it an unlikely candidate for a phospholipid that exerts a positive role in membrane fusion. As an inverted cone-shaped lipid in the cytoplasmic leaflet, PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub> is anticipated to antagonize the high negative membrane curvature required for the formation of a hemifusion intermediate that transitions to full fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chernomordik and Zimmerberg, 1995</xref>). SNARE function and membrane fusion have been reconstituted in proteoliposomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Weber et al., 1998</xref>) of various phospholipid compositions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brugger et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Vicogne et al., 2006</xref>) but the effects of PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub> on fusion have not been specifically determined. In the current work, we quantified the concentrations of PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub> at sites of vesicle docking (&#x0223c;6 mol%) on the plasma membrane and found that these concentrations strongly inhibited SNARE-dependent liposome fusion. However, we found that inclusion of a priming protein (CAPS) in the minimal fusion assay dramatically enhanced the rates and extent of SNARE-dependent fusion dependent on PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub>. We conclude that PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub>, at concentrations present in membrane microdomains, intrinsically acts to restrain membrane fusion but also serves as an essential cofactor to mediate protein recruitment, which promotes stimulation of SNARE-dependent membrane fusion.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Sites of vesicle docking correspond to high concentration PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub>&#x02013;containing microdomains</title><p>To determine the location and size of PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub> pools potentially required for regulated vesicle fusion, we incubated the monovalent PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub>&#x02013;binding PLC&#x003b4;<sub>1</sub>&#x02013;PH-GFP protein with plasma membrane sheets prepared from PC12 cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>).

The punctate distribution of PLC&#x003b4;<sub>1</sub>&#x02013;PH-GFP contrasted with a very different pattern observed with lipophilic fluorescence stains such as FM4-64 or octadecyl rhodamine B (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, C and D</xref>). Although some of the membrane puncta labeled with PLC&#x003b4;<sub>1</sub>&#x02013;PH-GFP exhibited FM4-64 staining, likely representing endocytic structures, the majority did not (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, B</xref> vs. C).

Triple colocalization studies revealed that &#x0223c;50% of CAPS clusters on the plasma membrane colocalized with PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub> and docked vesicles (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, J and K</xref>, middle). Sites containing both PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub> and CAPS had a high likelihood (&#x0223c;70%) of containing a docked vesicle (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, J and K</xref>, bottom), and &#x0223c;20% of the docked vesicles were present at these sites (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 K</xref>, top).

We incorporated PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub> at 5&#x02013;10 mol% (95&#x02013;90 mol% phosphatidylcholine [PC]) into plasma membrane&#x02013;like SNAP-25/syntaxin-1&#x02013;containing acceptor liposomes that were tested for fusion with PC/phosphatidylserine (PS) (85:15) donor liposomes containing VAMP-2 and fluorescent phospholipids <italic>N</italic>-(7-nitro-2-1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl)-1,2-dipalmitoyl phosphatidylethanolamine (NBD-PE) and <italic>N</italic>-(lissamine rhodamine B sulfonyl)-1,2-dipalmitoyl phosphatidylethanolamine (Rh-PE) at self-quenching concentrations. Parallel assays were conducted with SNAP-25/syntaxin-1&#x02013;containing acceptor liposomes composed of PC/PS (85:15). SNARE-containing PC/PS liposomes exhibited a time-dependent increase in NBD fluorescence characteristic of SNARE-dependent lipid mixing as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Weber et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>), which was reduced to background by cleaving VAMP-2 with botulinum toxin B (not depicted). In contrast, SNAP-25/syntaxin-1 acceptor liposomes that contained PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub> exhibited decreased rates and extent of lipid mixing with donor VAMP-2&#x02013;containing PC/PS liposomes. NBD fluorescence at 120 min was reduced by 25&#x02013;30% in PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub>&#x02013;containing liposomes compared with PS-containing liposomes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). The extent of inhibition by 10 mol% PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub> varied with assay conditions but reached 40&#x02013;60% when a greater extent of SNARE-dependent fusion was driven at higher liposome concentrations (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>). The inhibition of SNARE-dependent fusion occurred over a range of PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub> concentrations that encompassed the 6 mol% that was measured in the cytoplasmic leaflet microdomains of PC12 cell plasma membranes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>). Because protein-free (Pf) PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub>&#x02013;containing liposomes can mix phospholipids under certain conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Summers et al., 1996</xref>), we also tested Pf acceptor liposomes.

Indeed, we found a similar inhibition of SNARE-dependent fusion when phosphoinositides were incorporated into either donor or acceptor liposome populations (see Fig. 3 E, open bars, for PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub>). Overall, the results indicated that concentrations of PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub> equivalent to those measured in cytoplasmic leaflet microdomains on the plasma membrane inhibit SNARE-mediated vesicle fusion, but the underlying mechanism of inhibition was unclear.</p><p>Two potential mechanisms for inhibition were considered. The first involves the intrinsic positive curvature&#x02013;promoting properties of PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub> as an inverted cone lipid with a large charged hydrophilic head group. Inverted cone lipids inhibit membrane fusion because packing in the contacting leaflets of bilayers (positive curvature) is energetically unfavorable for the formation of a hemifused stalk intermediate (negative curvature) necessary for full fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chernomordik and Zimmerberg, 1995</xref>). This mechanism would predict that PI 3,4-P<sub>2</sub> was equally inhibitory, whereas PI 4-P was less inhibitory than PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub> as we had shown (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>). Favoring this mechanism, we found that inverted cone lipids, such as lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), inhibited SNARE-dependent fusion of PC/PS liposomes to a similar extent as inclusion of PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub>, and that inhibition by LPC and PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub> was nonadditive (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D</xref>). Other inverted cone lipids have similarly been found to inhibit SNARE-dependent liposome fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Melia et al., 2006</xref>). A mechanism for inhibition of fusion by PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub> involving curvature promotion would not exhibit donor or acceptor membrane specificity, which is what we observed (see <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 E</xref>).</p><p>A second possible mechanism for inhibition is direct interactions between PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub> and SNARE proteins. Syntaxin-1 and VAMP-2 possess juxtamembrane stretches of basic amino acids, which typically exhibit high affinity interactions with negatively charged PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kweon et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wang et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lam et al., 2008</xref>). The highly basic juxtamembrane region of syntaxin-1 is positioned at the head group layer of the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kweon et al., 2002</xref>), and interactions with PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub> are likely responsible for the reported immobilization of SNAP-25/syntaxin-1 heterodimers in PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub>&#x02013;containing supported bilayers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wagner and Tamm, 2001</xref>). This mechanism is based on charge interactions that would not distinguish inositide bisphosphates but would predict their greater inhibitory efficacy compared with PI 4-P, which we had observed (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>). To test this mechanism for inhibition by PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub>, we generated mutant syntaxin-1 proteins with lysine to alanine substitutions in the juxtamembrane region (Stx1A-K252,253A, Stx1A-K264,265A, and Stx1A-K252,253,264,265A), which were incorporated with SNAP-25 to produce acceptor liposomes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 E</xref>). Wild-type and mutant syntaxins were indistinguishable in fusion assays that used PC/PS liposomes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 E</xref>), which indicated that properties of syntaxin-1 essential for SNARE-mediated fusion were preserved in the mutants. In contrast, wild-type and syntaxin-1 mutants exhibited different properties in fusion assays that used PC/PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub> liposomes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 E</xref>). 10 mol% PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub> inhibited SNARE-dependent liposome fusion with wild-type syntaxin-1, but this inhibition was substantially greater with the mutant syntaxins (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 E</xref>). Thus, mutant syntaxins exhibited loss of function in fusion in PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub>&#x02013; but not in PS-containing liposomes. The results indicate that wild-type syntaxin-1 interacts with PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub> via its membrane-proximal basic domain. The results also indicate that wild-type syntaxin-1 interactions with PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub> function to counteract the inhibition of fusion by PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub>. PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub> may interfere with the formation of a high curvature membrane fusion intermediate, and syntaxin-1, by sequestering PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub> in cis-interactions, may enable transition of this intermediate to full fusion. Similar, direct interactions of PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub> with basic regions of VAMP-2 might also function to counteract the inhibitory effects of PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub> in fusion.</p></sec><sec><title>The stimulatory role of PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub> on fusion mediated by CAPS</title><p>The preceding results on the inhibition of fusion by PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub> in the minimal system for reconstituted membrane fusion are incompatible with the characterized positive essential role of PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub> in regulated vesicle exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hay et al., 1995</xref>). This previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hay et al., 1995</xref>) found that degradation of PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub> inhibits rather than stimulates triggered vesicle fusion. Thus, we considered the possibility that additional factors missing from the minimal system were needed to reconstitute the positive role of PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub> in fusion. A previous study identified CAPS as an essential factor for reconstituting triggered vesicle exocytosis in permeable cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Walent et al., 1992</xref>). CAPS binds PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Loyet et al., 1998</xref>), and the activity of CAPS is dependent on PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub> synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Grishanin et al., 2004</xref>).

This was confirmed by the full inhibition of CAPS-stimulated fusion by cleavage of VAMP-2 with botulinum neurotoxin B (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>) or by inclusion of a soluble syntaxin-1 cytoplasmic domain protein that blocks SNARE complex formation (not depicted). These results indicated that CAPS increased liposome fusion by a PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub>&#x02013; and SNARE-dependent mechanism.</p><p>To analyze the kinetics, initial rates of fusion for either PC/PS or PC/PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub> acceptor liposomes were measured over a range of CAPS concentrations (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>). CAPS increased rates of SNARE-dependent fusion in this study about fivefold with an EC<sub>50</sub> of &#x0223c;1 &#x003bc;M in CAPS with PC/PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub> acceptor liposomes but exerted little stimulation with PC/PS acceptor liposomes. Increased rates of SNARE-mediated fusion by CAPS were largely dependent on the presence of PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub> with an EC<sub>50</sub> of &#x0223c;3 mol% in SNAP-25/syntaxin-1 liposomes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 D</xref>). Maximal stimulation of rates by CAPS was observed at 5 mol% PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub>, which corresponded closely to estimates for concentrations present in cytoplasmic leaflet microdomains at sites of docked vesicles (&#x0223c;6 mol%). Determinations of the final extent of liposome fusion (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 D</xref>, inset) revealed that CAPS also counteracted the PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub> inhibition of fusion and promoted an increased extent of fusion. Overall, the data suggest that CAPS exerts multiple PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub>&#x02013;dependent effects on fusion. Although CAPS may counteract PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub> inhibition in a manner similar to syntaxin-1 by sequestering the phosphoinositide, it also dramatically increased rates of SNARE-dependent fusion, which suggests a direct or indirect effect of CAPS on SNARE protein function after its PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub>&#x02013;dependent membrane recruitment.</p><p>Whereas the inhibition of SNARE-dependent fusion by PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub> was observed to be symmetric in donor and acceptor liposomes, the PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub>&#x02013;dependent stimulation of fusion by CAPS was found to be highly asymmetrical (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 E</xref>). CAPS counteracted the inhibition observed with PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub> in VAMP-2&#x02013;containing donor liposomes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 E</xref>), which is consistent with a sequestration mechanism for relieving inhibition. However, CAPS failed to accelerate rates or stimulate the final extent of fusion with PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub> in the VAMP-2&#x02013;containing donor liposomes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 E</xref>). In contrast, CAPS accelerated rates and stimulated the extent of fusion with PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub> in SNAP-25/syntaxin-1&#x02013;containing acceptor liposomes or with PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub> in both donor and acceptor liposomes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 E</xref>). The asymmetry observed for CAPS stimulation, with a requirement for PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub> in cis with syntaxin-1 and SNAP-25, corresponds to the known dominant localization of SNAP-25, syntaxin-1, and PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub> in the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aikawa et al., 2006</xref>), to the observed PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub>&#x02013;dependent binding of CAPS to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Grishanin et al., 2004</xref>), and to the colocalization of CAPS with PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub> microdomains in the plasma membrane (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 J</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>The CAPS PH domain mediates the stimulatory role of PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub> in fusion</title><p>CAPS contains a PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub>&#x02013;binding PH domain that is essential for CAPS function in vesicle exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Grishanin et al., 2002</xref>). Because CAPS stimulation of SNARE-dependent liposome fusion was largely PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub> dependent, we determined whether PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub> binding by the PH domain was sufficient to stimulate liposome fusion. A PH domain fusion protein failed to stimulate fusion even at high concentrations (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>), which indicates that binding to PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub> per se is not sufficient to accelerate SNARE-dependent fusion. The PH domain fusion protein did inhibit the acceleration of SNARE-dependent fusion by CAPS (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>). A high molar excess of the fusion protein was required for inhibition, but this likely reflects the attenuated PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub>&#x02013;binding affinity of this GST fusion protein compared with CAPS. Nonetheless, the results suggest that binding to PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub> is essential for CAPS stimulation of fusion. PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub> may function by recruiting CAPS via its PH domain to the acceptor liposome membrane. Because the PH domain of CAPS also binds PI 3,4-P<sub>2</sub> and, to a lesser extent, PI 4-P (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref>), we tested the activity of CAPS in accelerating fusion with acceptor liposomes that contained these phosphoinositides. Consistent with the phosphoinositide-binding properties of the CAPS PH domain, we found that CAPS promoted an eightfold increase in the rate of liposome fusion with 5 mol% PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub> or PI 3,4-P<sub>2</sub> in SNAP-25/syntaxin-1 acceptor liposomes but only a 4.7-fold increase with 5 mol% PI 4-P in liposomes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 C</xref>). The similar phosphoinositide-binding properties of the CAPS PH domain and the CAPS acceleration of fusion are consistent with a role for the PH domain in mediating the membrane recruitment of CAPS for SNARE-dependent fusion. A lack of headgroup specificity of the CAPS PH domain for inositide bisphosphates may not be relevant in cells where PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub> but not PI 3,4-P<sub>2</sub> is highly enriched in the plasma membrane. In contrast, binding to PI 4-P is likely relevant in cells where the priming of vesicle exocytosis by PI 4-P has been characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Olsen et al., 2003</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig4"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p><bold>CAPS acceleration of fusion requires a functional PH domain.</bold> (A) CAPS PH domain fails to accelerate fusion but inhibits CAPS stimulation.

Mechanisms responsible for this essential role of PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub> in triggered vesicle fusion have not been elucidated. The current studies revealed that plasma membranes from PC12 cells contain microdomains of PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub>, which confirms previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Laux et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aoyagi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Milosevic et al., 2005</xref>). A substantial fraction of docked vesicles colocalized with PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub>&#x02013;containing (&#x0223c;35%) or CAPS/PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub>&#x02013;containing (&#x0223c;20%) microdomains, and these vesicles may correspond to the ready-release pool at which preferential triggered vesicle fusion occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aoyagi et al., 2005</xref>). A direct calibrated determination of PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub> concentrations in cytoplasmic leaflet microdomains labeled with a PLC&#x003b4;<sub>1</sub>&#x02013;PH-GFP protein indicated that &#x0223c;6 mol% PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub> was present at these sites, contrasted with &#x0223c;1 mol% in interdomain regions. If these diffraction-limited microdomains are smaller than &#x0223c;200 nm, they would contain concentrations of PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub> &#x0003e;6 mol%. These determinations provide the first estimate of PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub> concentrations that may be relevant for membrane-localized events regulated by PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub>. However, these determinations are based on the assumption that the PLC&#x003b4;<sub>1</sub>-PH domain probe binds equally well to PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub> in the plasma membrane and in supported bilayers. Nonetheless, consistent with our estimate for PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub> concentrations in microdomains, reconstituted endocytic budding from liposomes was found to require &#x0223c;6 mol% PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kinuta et al., 2002</xref>), and the reconstituted CAPS stimulation of fusion described here was optimal at 5 mol% PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 D</xref>).</p><p>We found that concentrations of PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub> in this range inhibited SNARE-dependent fusion in liposomes in the absence of CAPS. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Vicogne et al.

Conversely, PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub> in donor liposomes stimulated fusion with PA-containing acceptor liposomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Vicogne et al., 2006</xref>). In our assays, PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub> consistently inhibited SNARE-dependent fusion symmetrically when present in either donor or acceptor liposomes. Aside from the absence of PA, our assays contained lower SNARE densities (e.g., &#x0223c;100 copies of VAMP-2 per liposome), which likely accounts for differences between our results and those of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Vicogne et al. (2006)</xref>. At high SNARE densities, PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub>&#x02013;containing liposomes can coaggregate in trans because of charge-mediated interactions. At the PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub> concentrations and SNARE densities we used, liposomes did not aggregate as determined by light scattering studies (see Materials and methods).</p><p>In spite of the lack of aggregation, inclusion of PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub> resulted in an inhibition of SNARE-dependent fusion. Because PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub> immobilizes SNAP-25/syntaxin-1 heterodimers in supported bilayers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wagner and Tamm, 2001</xref>), we considered the possibility that charge-mediated interactions between SNAREs and PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub> may be responsible for the observed inhibition of fusion. However, we found that liposomes containing syntaxin mutants with a reduced number of juxtamembrane basic residues exhibited more profoundly inhibited rates of fusion. This indicates that syntaxin-1 interactions with PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub> play a positive role in reducing inhibition. Because inverted cone lipids that exert positive curvature on the solvent-exposed leaflet are also inhibitory for SNARE-dependent fusion (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D</xref>), it is likely that PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub> inhibits fusion by a similar mechanism. Consistent with this mechanism, we found that PI 3,4-P<sub>2</sub> similarly inhibited fusion whereas PI 4-P was less inhibitory. Inverted cone lipids antagonize the formation and transition of a high negative curvature stalk intermediate that is essential for full fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chernomordik and Zimmerberg, 1995</xref>). Positively charged juxtamembrane regions of SNAREs may sequester PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub> from membrane regions that undergo high curvature transitions during fusion. High curvature was also reported to be needed to fully zipper trans-SNARE complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Melia et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, SNAREs may help promote the curvature needed for completion of SNARE complex formation and for the transition of a hemifusion intermediate to full fusion. Interactions between PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub> and the juxtamembrane regions of SNAREs might provide important coupling between the state of membrane curvature and trans-SNARE complex formation.</p><p>Syntaxin-1 mutants harboring charge-neutralizing substitutions in the juxtamembrane region would be anticipated to reduce evoked vesicle fusion in neuroendocrine cells because of increased PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub> inhibition and reduced transition probabilities of hemifusion intermediates to full fusion. In accord with this, a recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lam et al., 2008</xref>) showed that replacement of wild-type syntaxin with syntaxin1A-R262,263A or syntaxin1A-K260,R262,R263,K264,K265A mutants reduced evoked vesicle fusion that was partially reversed by inducing favorable membrane curvature. Vesicle exocytosis in the cells harboring syntaxin mutants also exhibited prolonged pre-spike feet in amperometric recordings of catecholamine release, which may indicate delays in fusion pore expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lam et al., 2008</xref>). Although these properties are consistent with the cell-free fusion results on PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub> reported here, there is some uncertainty about which acidic phospholipids in cells are responsible for these observed effects on fusion.</p><p>Because the intrinsic properties of PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub> resulted in inhibition in a minimal fusion assay, we sought additional factors that might mediate the well-characterized essential positive role for PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub> in vesicle fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hay et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Holz et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Olsen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Milosevic et al., 2005</xref>). CAPS is one such factor having previously been characterized as a PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub>&#x02013;binding protein that is required for a late step in vesicle exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Grishanin et al., 2004</xref>). Inclusion of CAPS in the minimal fusion assay containing PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub> resulted in a marked stimulation of rates of SNARE-dependent liposome fusion. The stimulation of fusion by CAPS required its phosphoinositide-binding properties based on the dependence of its activity in fusion on inclusion of phosphoinositides in acceptor liposomes, the ability of a phosphoinositide-binding PH domain fusion protein to inhibit CAPS activity in fusion, and the strong loss of function observed for CAPS PH domain mutants. Although the CAPS PH domain interacts equally well with PI 3,4-P<sub>2</sub> and PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub>, the selectivity for its membrane recruitment to sites of exocytosis in cells would be dictated by cytoplasmic leaflet microdomains of PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub>. Although the concentrations and distribution of PI 4-P in the plasma membrane remain unknown, PI 4-P binding by CAPS may mediate the characterized activity of this phosphoinositide in priming vesicle exocytosis in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Olsen et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>Phosphoinositide binding by CAPS appeared to be essential for its promotion of SNARE-dependent fusion, but it was not sufficient based on the lack of activity of its PH domain. We also eliminated the possibility that full-length CAPS might be a multivalent PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub>&#x02013;binding protein that could aggregate liposomes to promote fusion (see Materials and methods). Although CAPS alleviated the inhibition of fusion by PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub> incorporated in VAMP-2 donor liposomes, it also strongly stimulated rates of fusion well beyond an alleviation of inhibition, but only when PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub> was incorporated in SNAP-25/syntaxin-1 liposomes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 E</xref>). The selective effect of PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub> in acceptor liposomes for mediating CAPS-stimulated fusion suggests that CAPS may exert additional actions on SNAP-25 and/or syntaxin-1 in cis on liposomes to accelerate SNARE-dependent fusion and that these actions are not provided by CAPS PH domain. Future studies will need to discover the full basis for CAPS regulation of SNARE-dependent fusion.</p><p>The current work suggests two mechanisms by which PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub> regulates membrane fusion. The first of these mechanisms is inhibitory, mediated by the intrinsic positive curvature&#x02013;promoting properties of PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub>. SNAREs may counteract this restraint on membrane fusion by sequestering PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub> via membrane proximal basic domains. In the second mechanism, PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub> strongly facilitates rates of membrane fusion by recruitment of PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub>&#x02013;binding proteins such as CAPS that possess additional properties to promote SNARE function in fusion. Given the precedent for clathrin-dependent endocytosis in which at least six PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub>&#x02013;binding proteins function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ungewickell and Hinrichsen, 2007</xref>), this mechanism for PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub> in membrane fusion may extend to proteins such as synaptotagmin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bai et al., 2004</xref>), rabphilin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chung et al., 1998</xref>), and other PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub>&#x02013;binding proteins containing basic residue-rich regions or C2 and PH domains.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title><p>1,2-dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine (DOPC), 1,2-dioleoyl phosphatidylserine (DOPS), NBD-PE, rhodamine-PE, PI 4,5-P<sub>2</sub>, and PI 4-P were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc.

Lipid mixing was reported by the loss of fluorescence resonance energy transfer between fluorescent lipids (NBD-PE and Rh-PE) concentrated in the VAMP-2 liposomes that occurs upon fusion with the non-fluorescent SNAP-25/syntaxin-1 liposomes. The standard assay used 0.45 mM of acceptor and 0.225 mM of donor liposomes in a total volume of 75 &#x003bc;l of reconstitution buffer without glycerol. CAPS protein was added at concentrations indicated in the figure legends. 90&#x000b0; light scattering and dynamic light scattering studies did not detect any aggregation of liposomes during the fusion reactions. Blank reactions were prepared for all conditions by substituting SNAP-25/syntaxin-1 acceptor liposomes with Pf liposomes to detect non-SNARE&#x02013;mediated lipid mixing. Reactions were assembled on ice and flick mixed before addition to 96-well FluoroNunc plates.

We normalized raw fluorescence lipid-mixing data to eliminate non-SNARE&#x02013;dependent fluorescence changes. Parallel reactions with Pf liposomes substituting for SNAP-25/syntaxin-1 liposomes provide a measure of non-SNARE&#x02013;mediated lipid mixing at all time points. SNARE-dependent lipid mixing was obtained as the difference between the raw fluorescence observed for SNARE-containing liposomes and an identical lipid mixing assay containing Pf liposomes after scaling raw fluorescent values based on maximal fluorescence after detergent addition. This normalization method generates values with units that are also &#x0201c;percentage NBD fluorescence of max&#x0201d; and are comparable to conventional data but have an important background subtracted.
