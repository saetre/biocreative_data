Transgenic plants expressing constitutively active (CA) forms of ROP (Rho-of-plants) GTPases have been shown to cause the disruption of root hair polarity likely as a result of the alteration of actin filaments (AF) and microtubules (MT) organization. Towards understanding the mechanism by which ROP controls the cytoskeletal organization during root hair tip growth, we have screened for <italic>CA-rop2</italic> suppressors or enhancers using CA1-1, a transgenic line that expresses <italic>CA-rop2</italic> and shows only mild disruption of tip growth. Here, we report the characterization of a <italic>CA-rop2</italic> enhancer (<italic>cae1-1</italic> CA1-1) that exhibits bulbous root hairs. The <italic>cae1-1</italic> mutation on its own caused a waving and branching root hair phenotype. <italic>CAE1</italic> encodes the root hair growth-related, ARM domain-containing kinesin-like protein MRH2 (and thus <italic>cae1-1</italic> was renamed to <italic>mrh2-3</italic>). Cortical MT displayed fragmentation and random orientation in <italic>mrh2</italic> root hairs. Consistently, the MT-stabilizing drug taxol could partially rescue the wavy root hair phenotype of <italic>mrh2-3</italic>, and the MT-depolymerizing drug Oryzalin slightly enhanced the root hair tip growth defect in CA1-1. Interestingly, the addition of the actin-depolymerizing drug Latrunculin B further enhanced the Oryzalin effect. This indicates that the cross-talk of MT and AF organization is important for the <italic>mrh2-3</italic> CA1-1 phenotype. Although we did not observe an apparent effect of the <italic>MRH2</italic> mutation in AF organization, we found that <italic>mrh2-3</italic> root hair growth was more sensitive to Latrunculin B. Moreover, an ARM domain-containing MRH2 fragment could bind to the polymerized actin <italic>in vitro</italic>. Therefore, our genetic analyses, together with cell biological and pharmacological evidence, suggest that the plant-specific kinesin-related protein MRH2 is an important component that controls MT organization and is likely involved in the ROP2 GTPase-controlled coordination of AF and MT during polarized growth of root hairs.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Root hairs are long, thin tubular-shaped outgrowths from root epidermal cells. Root hair development has been conceptually divided into several phases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001074-Carol1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001074-Sieberer1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. The first phase is specification of the hair-producing cells called trichoblasts. Trichoblasts undergo longitudinal growth and are morphologically distinct from non-hair-producing cells called atrichoblasts. The fate specification process is determined by the positional information in alternating cell files. The second phase is root hair growth initiation where trichoblast cell polarity is established, manifested by the bulge formation close to the basal end of the trichoblast. The third phase is tip growth. This phase is characterized by the early-stage slow outgrowth from the bulge to form a swelling of up to about 20&#x02013;40 &#x000b5;m in length (transition to tip growth) and the subsequent rapid elongation of hairs (tip growth). Significant cellular activities at this phase include extended cytoskeleton (re)organization, rapid exocytosis, nuclear migration toward the tip, and vacuolation. At the end, tip growth arrests, resulting in the fully-grown, mature hairs.</p><p>Accumulating evidence show that root hair tip growth is a highly dynamic process, requiring the well-organized cytoskeletons, such as actin filaments (AF) and microtubules (MT), to facilitate active organelle and vesicle transport <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001074-Grierson1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001074-Samaj1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>.

The critical roles of AF and MT in root hair tip growth have been demonstrated by the alterations of tip growth that are caused by the changes in AF and MT organization. Both drugs and genetic mutations or transgenic modifications have been used to disrupt AF and MT organizations. The drugs include those that disrupt polymerization/deploymerization dynamics of actin (such as Latrunculin B abbreviated here as LatB, and cytochalasin D) and MT (such as Oryzalin abbreviated here as Ory, and taxol) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001074-Baluska1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001074-Lloyd1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, while the genes mutated or overexpressed include those encoding critical components of actin (such as Actin2, PFN1, FH8 and ADF1) or MT (&#x003b1;&#x02013;tubulin, MOR1, MRH2) organization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001074-Bao1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001074-Yi1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. These studies have led to a general hypothesis: while AF are involved in both tip growth and polarity control, MT are not required for tip growth but important for maintaining the growth direction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001074-Carol1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001074-Sieberer1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001074-Bibikova1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001074-Ketelaar1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, AF and MT together form a dynamic network which is important for root hair tip growth. For example, a 30-min pulse application of cytochalasin D broadened the tip of growing hairs, but after the application the tip was quickly recovered to the original growth direction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001074-Ketelaar1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. However, if the root hairs were also treated by Ory (which almost completely disrupted MT organization but did not inhibit hair elongation rates), the growth occurred in a random direction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001074-Ketelaar1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>.

However, how ROP GTPases regulate the AF and MT organization in root hair tip growth remains elusive. Studies from pollen tube tip growth and leaf pavement cell morphogenesis suggest a conserved function of Rho family GTPases in yeast, animals and plants, but specific features of the biochemical mechanisms mediated by ROP-regulated AF and MT assembly (such as plant-unique Rop effector proteins called RICs) seem to differ from those of Cdc42/Rac-dependent mechanisms in yeast and animals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001074-Fu1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001074-Gu1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001074-Gu2">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>To identify the regulatory components involved in the ROP2 control of AF and MT organization during root hair tip growth, we decided to screen for enhancers or suppressors of the CA1-1 transgenic line expressing <italic>CA-rop2</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001074-Jones2">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>.

The putative kinesin MRH2 contains a conserved motor domain (amino acids 102&#x02013;449) close to the N-terminus, followed by nine coiled-coil (CC) domains in the middle, and three Armadillo/&#x003b2;-catenin-like (ARM) repeats (amino acids 792&#x02013;915) close to the C-terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001074-g002">Figure 2A</xref>, lower panel).

KHC belongs to Kinesin-1 family kinesins that can transport vesicles or organelles along with MT, by forming a tetramer with itself and kinesin light chain molecules.

However, given by the subtle phenotype of the <italic>MRH2</italic> T-DNA knockout lines, it would be difficult to envision its function in the ROP2-controlled root hair tip growth as reported here. Through an enhancer screen, we have provided further evidence that MRH2 has a predominant role in the control of root hair growth.

Importantly, although the promoter is also active in leaf trichomes and pavement cells, the <italic>MRH2</italic> mutation does not alter trichome and pavement cell morphogenesis in both Col and <italic>CA-rop2</italic> plants (data not shown). In addition, we have found that a T-DNA knockout mutant (Salk_124908) for one (encoded by At1g01950) of the two <italic>MRH2</italic>-closely related, ARM domain-containing kinesins does not exhibit any root hair growth defect (data not shown).</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>A role for MRH2 in coordinating MT and AF during root hair tip growth</title><p>Our observations that the <italic>MRH2</italic> mutation causes cortical MT to be randomly oriented and fragmented and greatly enhances the <italic>CA-rop2</italic>-activated disruption of MT organization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001074-g004">Figure 4</xref>) suggest that MRH2 is important for stabilizing MT or maintaining MT orientation. This role is further supported by the drug studies in which the MT stabilization drug, taxol, can partially rescue the wavy root hair phenotype of <italic>mrh2-3</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001074-g005">Figure 5</xref>) and the MT depolymerization drug, Ory, can mimic the effect of <italic>mrh2-3</italic> in enhancing the CA1-1 root hair tip growth effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001074-g006">Figure 6</xref>).

Taken together, these results show that MRH2 is important for stabilizing cortical MT or maintaining normally longitudinal orientation of MT during root hair tip growth. However, the mechanism by which MRH2 regulates MT organization remains unknown. MRH2 contains the ARM domain which is believed to be involved in protein-protein interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001074-Miki1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001074-Coates1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>, raising the possibility that this domain might facilitate the MRH2 function in MT organization or transport.

In this hypothesis, the ARM domain of MRH2 might interact with an unknown regulatory protein involved in MT organization or an unknown cargo-binding protein involved in vesicle/organelle transport.</p><p>Unexpectedly, we have found that MRH2 is possibly involved in the coordination of MT and AF organization or dynamics in root hairs. Results from the drug experiments indicate a possible role for MRH2 in the control of AF organization or dynamics or the coordination of AF and MT. First, <italic>mrh2</italic> root hairs were more sensitive than wild-type to LatB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001074-g007">Figure 7</xref>). Second, the addition of LatB enhanced the Ory effect in mimicking the effect of the <italic>MRH2</italic> mutation in CA1-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001074-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Although we did not observe any dramatic alterations in AF organization in <italic>mrh2-3</italic>, or in <italic>mrh2-3</italic> CA1-1 compared to CA1-1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001074.s002">Figure S1</xref>), this might be due to either the subtle changes in AF organization which could not be revealed by the ABD2-GFP marker, or the transient or dynamic AF changes which need to be studied further. The possibility that the increased sensitivity to LatB might be secondary effect can not be excluded, although LatB is a relatively specific actin depolymerization drug which acts by forming a high affinity complex with monomeric actin. Interestingly, we have observed that the ARM domain-containing MRH2 fragment (MRH2<sup>649-1051</sup>) could bind to the polymerized actin in an <italic>in vitro</italic> high-speed co-sedimentation assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001074-g008">Figure 8</xref>), although its affinity was 50&#x00025; lower than that in AtFIM1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001074-Kovar1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. The binding of this truncated MRH2 fragment to actin is less likely the result of non-specific aggregation with the polymerized actin, because it did not seem to co-sediment with the polymerized tubulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001074-g009">Figure 9</xref>). This finding is a surprise to us, as MRH2 does not contain any known actin binding domain. It has been reported that several <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> kinesins contain the actin-binding CH domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001074-Richardson1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001074-Lee1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001074-Preuss1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>, as in the case of a CH domain-containing cotton kinesin (GhKCH1) which is shown to bind to the polymerized actin <italic>in vitro</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001074-Preuss1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>. However, none of these <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> kinesins has been demonstrated to bind to the polymerized actin <italic>in vitro</italic>. Indeed, it remains unknown if any of the 61 members of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> kinesins is directly involved in the control of AF organization. Therefore, one of the future directions is to confirm the MRH2-actin binding <italic>in vivo</italic> and determine its functional significance.</p><p>The mechanism by which MRH2 might coordinate MT and AF organization remains unclear. Studies using MT and AF drugs suggest that AF and MT together form a dynamic network during root hair tip growth: on the one hand, MT are important for maintaining the growth direction, and alterations in MT lead to changes in AF organization; on the other hand, AF are involved in both tip growth and polarity control, and AF can specify the MT direction of cell expansion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001074-Carol1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001074-Sieberer1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001074-Bibikova1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001074-Ketelaar1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Although how MRH2 coordinates AF and MT organization or dynamics remains to be determined, MT organization is the basis for MRH2 involvement in the MT and AF cross-talk during root hair tip growth. This is because LatB alone had no effect in the CA1-1 root hair phenotype, but it could further stimulate the Ory enhancement effect in CA1-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001074-g006">Figure 6</xref>). This type of indirect interaction between kinesin and actin has been reported in the yeast tip growth model. In this model, Tea2p, a kinesin-like motor protein, redirects actin assembly through the &#x0201c;polarisome&#x0201d; complex that interacts with a formin called For3p <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001074-Martin1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, some of the yeast &#x0201c;polarisome&#x0201d; components have homologs in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001074-Sieberer1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001074-Bisgrove1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>, and therefore, MRH2 might act through a similar mechanism for its cross-talk with AF during root hair tip growth. However, the possibility for a direct interaction between MRH2 and AF can not be excluded, as we have shown the <italic>in vitro</italic> interaction between MRH2<sup>649-1051</sup> and the polymerized actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001074-g008">Figure 8</xref>). The presence of the ARM domain might facilitate the direct binding of MRH2 to AF, but whether such binding occurs <italic>in vivo</italic> remains to be determined.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Hypothetical models for the ROP2-MRH2 functional interaction in the control of MT and AF cross-talk</title><p>Our genetic evidence provides a functional link between ROP2 GTPase and the putative kinesin MRH2 in the control of MT and AF cross-talk during root hair tip growth, but the mechanism of their functional interaction remains unknown. We have observed that the combination of LatB and Ory treatments in CA1-1, but not in <italic>mrh2-3</italic>, could mimic the <italic>mrh2-3</italic> CA1-1 phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001074-g006">Figure 6</xref> and data not shown). This suggests that regulation of the ROP2 GTPase activity is essential for the control of root hair tip growth. We further show that inactivation of MRH2 alone and constitutive activation of ROP2 alone could similarly disrupt MT organization and their combination completely disrupted MT organization and root hair tip growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001074-g004">Figure 4</xref>). There exist at least two possibilities for the functional interaction between MRH2 and ROP2. One possibility is that MRH2 might act as a common, negative component of ROP2 signaling in the control of MT organization and MT-AF cross-talk. In this case, ROP2 might regulate MT organization through MRH2. It has been demonstrated in leaf epidermal cell morphogenesis that localized ROP2 activation can interact with and suppress its effector protein RIC1 which is required for the formation of MT bundles at neck regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001074-Fu1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, the RIC1-mediated MT organization in turn suppresses ROP2 activation in the indentation zone, leading to the suppression of RIC4 which promotes AF formation in the regions of growing lobes and the ultimate determination of leaf epidermal cell shape <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001074-Fu1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. If similar ROP-RIC signaling pathways operate in root hair tip growth, MRH2 might be regulated by certain member of RICs, resulting in the control of MT organization. Consequently, the MRH2-mediated MT organization then feedback regulates AF organization, or MRH2 might directly bind to AF to coordinate AF and MT. Alternatively, the MRH2-controlled MT organization might affect the ROP2 GTPase signaling in the regulation of MT and AF organization through RICs. Therefore, testing the role of RICs in root hair tip growth and isolating the MRH2 protein complex in the future will help to address the essential question regarding how MRH2 interacts with the ROP2 GTPase pathway in the control of MT and AF cross-talk in the polarized growth of root hairs.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Plant materials and growth conditions</title><p><italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> Columbia (Col), transgenic plants and mutants were used in this study.

Actin concentration was determined by spectrometry (A290 of 0.63 being equivalent to 1 mg/mL). The procedure was briefly described here. All proteins were preclarified at 200,000g before the experiment. In a 100-&#x000b5;L reaction volume, 3.0 &#x000b5;M of the polymerized actin was incubated with 0.5 &#x000b5;M of GST-MRH2<sup>649-1051</sup>, AtFIM1, and GST, respectively, in 1&#x000d7; KMEI-buffer (50 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM EGTA, and 10 mM imidazole-HCl, pH 7.0). 3.0 &#x000b5;M of the polymerized actin alone, and 0.5 &#x000b5;M of GST-MRH2<sup>649-1051</sup> alone, AtFIM1 alone, or GST alone were also used for the controls. After 1 h-incubation at 22&#x000b0;C, samples were centrifuged at 200,000 g for 1 h in a TL-100 centrifuge (Beckman, Palo Alto, CA, USA) at 4&#x000b0;C. The resulting supernatant was then transferred, and the protein loading buffer was added to the supernatant and the pellet. Equal amounts of the pellet and supernatant samples were separated by 12.5&#x00025; SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R. The band intensities were quantified by densitometry using Image J software (V.1.3; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij">http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij</ext-link>), and after the background subtraction, the percentage of proteins in the pellet was calculated.</p><p>For <italic>in vitro</italic> binding of GST-MRH2<sup>1-449</sup> and GST-MRH2<sup>649-1051</sup> to MT, a high-speed co-sedimentation assay, as described elsewhere <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001074-Mao1">&#x0005b;62&#x0005d;</xref> and similar to that described above, was performed to determine their binding to MT.

GST-MAP65-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001074-Mao1">&#x0005b;62&#x0005d;</xref>, a generous gift of Mao Tonglin (China Agricultural University), was used as a positive control.

Ten &#x000b5;M AMP-PNP was added for the binding to MT. After 30 min of incubation at room temperature in darkness, samples were centrifuged at 52,000 g in the Allegan 64R centrifuge with a Beckman F1202 rotor (Beckman, Palo Alto, CA, USA) for 15 min. Equal amounts of the pellet and the supernatant samples were separated and visualized as described above.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0001074.s001"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p>Primers used in PCR reactions.</p><p>(0.04 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0001074.s001.doc" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0001074.s002"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>AF organization in wild-type (Col), <italic>mrh2-3</italic>, CA1-1 and <italic>mrh2-3</italic> CA1-1 root hairs.
