Correspondingly, both the genetic lack of CB1 and the pharmacological blockade of CB1 inhibited the effect of ghrelin on AMPK activity. Ghrelin increased the endocannabinoid content of the hypothalamus in wild-type mice and this effect was abolished by rimonabant pre-treatment, while no effect was observed in CB1-KO animals. Electrophysiology studies showed that ghrelin can inhibit the excitatory inputs on the parvocellular neurons of the paraventricular nucleus, and that this effect is abolished by administration of a CB1 antagonist or an inhibitor of the DAG lipase, the enzyme responsible for 2-AG synthesis. The effect is also lost in the presence of BAPTA, an intracellular calcium chelator, which inhibits endocannabinoid synthesis in the recorded parvocellular neuron and therefore blocks the retrograde signaling exerted by endocannabinoids. In summary, an intact cannabinoid signaling pathway is necessary for the stimulatory effects of ghrelin on AMPK activity and food intake, and for the inhibitory effect of ghrelin on paraventricular neurons.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Ghrelin is a brain-gut peptide that stimulates appetite and also has direct effects on the regulation of energy balance in the periphery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001797-Higgins1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

A large body of evidence points to the role of the cannabinoid system in the hypothalamic neuronal regulation of appetite and body weight: tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), a plant-derived cannabinoid, and the endogenous cannabinoids anandamide (AEA) and 2-arachydinoyl glycerol (2-AG), have been shown to increase food intake via a specific receptor, CB1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001797-Kirkham1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001797-Matias1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>.

The corticotropin-releasing hormone- and thyrotropin-releasing hormone-secreting parvocellular neurons of the PVN are known to have an inhibitory effect on food intake <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001797-Gao1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. In the current study we have hypothesized that the appetite-inducing effects of ghrelin are mediated by the endogenous cannabinoid system. We have investigated the interaction between ghrelin and the cannabinoid systems on the mechanisms underlying appetite regulation by <italic>in vivo</italic> studies using rimonabant, a known antagonist of CB1, and by a genetic approach using CB1-knockout (CB1-KO) mice; we have also utilized an <italic>in vitro</italic> electrophysiological system to study the interaction of the two systems on parvocellular neurons of the PVN of mice. We show here that ghrelin does not induce appetite in CB1-KO mice. Furthermore, while ghrelin stimulates hypothalamic AMPK activity in wild-type mice, it has no effect on AMPK in CB1-KO or in CB1 antagonist-treated mice. The electrophysiological studies show that ghrelin can inhibit the excitatory inputs in the parvocellular neurons of the PVN and that this effect can be abolished by administration of a CB1 antagonist or THL, an inhibitor of the 2-AG synthesizing enzyme DAG lipase. The effect is also lost in the presence of BAPTA, an intracellular calcium chelator, which inhibits the endocannabinoid synthesis in the recorded cell and therefore blocks retrograde signaling exerted by endocannabinoids. Thus, the effect of ghrelin on hypothalamic AMPK, on neuronal activity in the PVN and ultimately on appetite, are dependent on CB1, and these data would be compatible with the existence of a ghrelin&#x02192;endocannabinoid&#x02192;CB1&#x02192;AMPK&#x02192;appetite signaling cascade.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>A) Food intake</title><p>Central administration of 1 &#x000b5;g ghrelin significantly increased the 2 h food intake in wild-type (WT) animals (ghrelin vs. control in WT mice: 1.02&#x000b1;0.08 g vs. 0.62&#x000b1;0.15 g Kruskal-Wallis test: n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;5&#x02013;9, df&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;3, overall T&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;14.4, overall P&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.0024; for individual comparison &#x0005b;Conover-Inman test&#x0005d;: critical t (21 df)&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;2.07, ghrelin vs. control P&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.0045, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001797-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>).

These data provide evidence that an interaction between ghrelin and the cannabinoid systems is crucial for the appetite-inducing effect of ghrelin.</p><p>We have previously shown that rimonabant inhibits the orexigenic effect of ghrelin in the rat when ghrelin is administered directly into the PVN <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001797-Tucci1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, and more recently chronic administration of rimonabant was also shown to suppress the orexigenic effect of the ghrelin-mimetic hexarelin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001797-Rigamonti1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. As rimonabant has certain CB1 receptor-independent actions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001797-Batkai1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001797-Fride1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, we used CB1-KO animals to show that the ghrelin effects involve the CB1 receptor. On the other hand, our rimonabant data in wild-type animals suggest that the lack of effect of ghrelin in CB1-KO animals is not due to compensatory mechanisms induced during embryonic development. Our study conclusively establishes the critical role of CB1 in mediating the effects of ghrelin on AMPK and appetite. We have now demonstrated that the orexigenic effect of ghrelin is absent in CB1-KO mice, substantiating the involvement of the cannabinoid system in the effects of ghrelin. Ghrelin's effects on AMPK, thought to mediate its orexigenic effects, are now also definitively shown to be CB1-dependent. Numerous studies have established that AMPK is involved in appetite regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001797-Minokoshi1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref> and we have reported, for the first time, that cannabinoids stimulate hypothalamic AMPK activity while we and others have shown that ghrelin also has similar effect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001797-Andersson1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001797-Kola1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. Our present data demonstrate that the effect of ghrelin on hypothalamic AMPK activity is also CB1-dependent. Ghrelin did not affect AMPK activity in CB1-KO hypothalamus, and pre-administration of the CB1 antagonist rimonabant blocked the stimulatory effect of ghrelin on AMPK activity, indicating that the ghrelin-AMPK interaction requires an intact cannabinoid signaling system in the hypothalamus. The concordance between the effects of rimonabant and the findings in CB1-KO animals at the level of food intake, AMPK activity and cannabinoid content clearly supports our hypothesis. Therefore, the effect of ghrelin on both AMPK and appetite is clearly dependent on an intact cannabinoid pathway.</p><p>Based on these data, we suggest the possibility that ghrelin may activate CB1 by increasing the synthesis of endocannabinoids. Endogenous hypothalamic cannabinoid levels have been reported to increase with fasting and to decrease immediately after re-feeding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001797-Kirkham1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, suggesting that they may play a role in determining hunger and satiety.

In addition, glucocorticoids have also been shown to influence the endocannabinoid content of the hypothalamus and exert an inhibitory effect on glutamate release onto parvocellular neurons of the PVN via an increase in the synthesis of endogenous cannabinoids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001797-Di1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001797-Di2">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. The implication of the endogenous cannabinoid system on the effects of the melanocortin system is contradictory, as &#x003b1;-MSH, at doses which lead to inhibition of food intake, does not inhibit endocannabinoid levels, although the MC4R receptor antagonist HS014 has a late stimulatory effect on 2-AG and AEA levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001797-Matias2">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, the appetite stimulatory effect of another MC4R antagonist, JKC-363, has previously been shown to be attenuated by CB1 receptor blockade <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001797-Verty1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. Similarly, the orexigenic effect of orexin A/hypocretin 1 is also blocked by rimonabant administration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001797-Crespo1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. The effect of insulin on hypothalamic endocannabinoid content, at doses which would inhibit food intake, has not been reported, but insulin at lower doses which lead to inhibition of hepatic glucose output does not affect hypothalamic endocannabinoid content <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001797-Matias2">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. In this study we have shown that ghrelin also influences the hypothalamic endocannabinoid content: ghrelin significantly increased 2-AG content in the hypothalamus of WT mice, suggesting that the effect of ghrelin involves an increase in 2-AG synthesis, which then can stimulate CB1. The activated CB1 receptor then leads to an increase in AMPK activity, and we suggest ultimately an increase in appetite. Ghrelin exerts its hypothalamic effects via the growth hormone secretagogue receptor type 1a, which is a Gq-PKC pathway-coupled receptor. It has recently been suggested that other receptors using this pathway may also stimulate endocannabinoid synthesis in neuronal cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001797-Turu1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, rimonabant administration blocked the stimulatory effect of ghrelin on 2-AG content and ghrelin had no effect on cannabinoid content of the hypothalamus in CB1-KO animals. These data suggest not only that CB1 is necessary for the effect of ghrelin on AMPK and appetite, but also that there may be a positive feedback between the CB1 and the endogenous 2-AG synthesis. This novel finding is compatible with recent data which showed increased extracellular 2-AG levels in rat hypothalamus in response to cannabinoid-agonist stimulation and decreased 2-AG levels after 10 mg/kg ip rimonabant treatment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001797-Bequet1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. In concordance, with our data, 3 mg/kg rimonabant did not have an effect on extracellular 2-AG and AEA levels but it antagonized the effect of the CB1 agonist WIN55,212-2 on the endocannabinoid release. Bequet et al. also suggest that rimonabant doses up to 10 mg/kg do not affect hypothalamus tissue content of endocannabinoids. Interestingly in this study, AEA release was stimulated by 10 mg/kg rimonabant, suggesting a different regulation and possibly different physiological roles for AEA and 2-AG <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001797-Bequet1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. The effects of ghrelin seem to be mediated predominantly by 2-AG as this has been the endocannabinoid affected predominantly by ghrelin and our electrophysiology data with a 2-AG synthesis inhibitor THL also supports the 2-AG mediation.</p><p>The positive feed-back between CB1 receptor and endocannabinoid synthesis suggested by these data could explain the lack of effect of ghrelin in the CB1-KO. Di Marzo et al. previously showed that there is no difference in hypothalamic cannabinoid levels between WT and CB1-KO mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001797-DiMarzo2">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref> and our data correspond to these findings. We postulate that in WT mice ghrelin would increase endocannabinoid synthesis, whose levels are then further amplified by CB1 stimulation, thus leading to further endocannabinoid biosynthesis. In this way, the presence of both ghrelin and CB1 receptors would be necessary. The effect of ghrelin on endocannabinoid synthesis could also be an indirect one through stimulation of NPY. Similarly to ghrelin, the orexigenic effect of NPY is abolished by rimonabant administration and is totally lost in CB1-KO mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001797-Poncelet1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, CB1 activation stimulates NPY release <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001797-Gamber1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref> therefore a positive feed-back loop between endocannabinoids and ghrelin-induced NPY would partly explain the lack of effect in CB1-KO animals. Conversely, tonic CB1 receptor stimulation alone, without concomitant ghrelin receptor stimulation, necessary to trigger both NPY and endocannabinoid synthesis, might not be sufficient to increase sufficiently the endogenous 2-AG levels, and this might explain why CB1-KO mice do not exhibit lower endocannabinoid levels in the hypothalamus.</p><p>In this study, we show that the AMPK-stimulating effect of cannabinoids is also CB1-dependent as it can be blocked by rimonabant and it is absent in CB1-KO animals. These data suggest that the CB1-dependent effects of ghrelin on AMPK activity and appetite are related. The lack of an orexigenic effect of ghrelin in CB1-KO animals could contribute to their lean phenotype.</p><p>Since in the hypothalamus ghrelin preferentially stimulated the synthesis of 2-AG, the endocannabinoid that primarily acts in the excitatory synapses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001797-Katona1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, we have studied the influence of ghrelin on the excitatory input of parvocellular neurons in the PVN. We observed that ghrelin inhibits the excitatory input on PVN neurons and this effect is blocked by the co-administration of the DAG lipase inhibitor, THL or CB1 antagonist, AM251, suggesting that 2-AG synthesis and functional CB1 is required for ghrelin to result in this effect. As we have hypothesized that endocannabinoid synthesis in the recorded PVN neurons themselves may play an important role in the effect of ghrelin, and as endocannabinoid synthesis is calcium dependent, we blocked intracellular calcium by using BAPTA in the recording electrode. Extracellular ghrelin treatment together with the intracellular BAPTA administration failed to inhibit the excitatory input to the postsynaptic neurons of the PVN. This finding suggests that the blockade of endocannabinoid synthesis by BAPTA in the postsynaptic cell itself results in blockade of endocannabinoid release and subsequent lack of stimulation on the presynaptic CB1, leading to a loss of inhibition of the excitatory glutamate release from the presynaptic terminal. An outline of the suggested pathway is shown on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001797-g004">Fig. 4</xref>.

Hypothalami from the second experiment were processed for measurement of endogenous cannabinoid content. All injections were performed between 0900 h and 1200 h.</p><p>In a third experiment, WT and CB1-KO mice were implanted with an intracerebroventricular (icv) cannula <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001797-Fekete1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. WT and CB1-KO mice were implanted with 25-gauge stainless steel guide cannula (Small Parts Inc., Miami Lakes, FL) into the lateral cerebral ventricle under stereotactic control (coordinates from Bregma anteroventral &#x02212;0.2; lateral 1.0; dorsoventral 2.0) through a burr hole in the skull <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001797-Fekete1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. The cannula was secured to the skull with &#x02018;Crazy Glue&#x02019; (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Fort Washington, PA) and dental cement, and temporarily occluded with a dummy cannula. Bacitracin ointment was applied to the interface of the cement and the skin. Animals were weighed daily and those showing signs of illness or weight loss were removed from the study and euthanized. One week after icv cannulation, both WT and CB1-KO mice were divided into two groups and received either vehicle or 1 &#x000b5;g of ghrelin icv in 4 &#x000b5;l aCSF between 0900h and 1000h in the light phase: food intake was measured at 2 h. The mice had free access to food before and during the experiment.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>AMPK activity assay</title><p>The kinase assay for AMPK activity has been previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001797-Kola1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001797-Hawley1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. Briefly, hypothalami of mice were weighed and homogenized with Precellys 24 using CK14 tubes containing ceramic beads (Stretton Scientific, Stretton, UK) at 6000rpm for 1 cycle of 20 sec in lysis buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, 50 mM NaF, 5 mM Na pyrophosphate, 1 mM EDTA, 250 mM sucrose, 1&#x00025; Triton X-100, 1 mM DTT, 1mM benzamidine, 0.1 mM phenylmethane sulfonyl fluoride, 5 &#x000b5;g/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor, and the tissue protein content was determined using BCA assay (Pierce, Rockford, USA).

The amount of anandamide, 2-AG and 1-AG in the samples was determined by using inverse linear regression of standard curves. Values were calculated as pmol or fmol per mg of wet tissue.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Whole-cell clamp experiments</title><p>WT mice were killed by cervical dislocation and were decapitated. The brain was removed in less than 1 min, and then immersed in ice cold artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF; NaCl 140 mM, KCl 3 mM, MgSO<sub>4</sub> 1.3 mM, NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> 1.4 mM, CaCl<sub>2</sub> 2.4 mM, glucose 11 mM, HEPES 5 mM, pH 7.25 with NaOH) bubbled with O<sub>2</sub>. Hypothalamic blocks were dissected from the mouse brains and 300 &#x000b5;m thick slices containing the PVN were sectioned with a VT-1000S vibratome (Leica GmBH, Germany) using a sapphire knife (Delaware Diamond Knives Inc., Wilmington, DE) in ice-cold oxygenated aCSF. The slices were bisected along the third ventricle and equilibrated in aCSF saturated with O<sub>2</sub> at room temperature for 1.5 h. In order to record postsynaptic currents in the neurons, the equilibrated hemi-slices were placed in an immersion-type recording chamber. The brain slices were oxygenated, during recording at RT, by bubbling the aCSF with O<sub>2</sub> gas during recording at room temperature. The cells were voltage clamped at room temperature using a whole-cell clamp configuration. The instruments used for electrophysiology were as follows: Axopatch 200B patch clamp amplifier, Digidata-1322A data acquisition system and pCLAMP 9.2 software (Axon Instruments-Molecular Devices Co., Sunnyvale, CA). The headstage of the amplifier was fitted to a MHW-3 hydraulic micromanipulator (Narishige Co., Japan). The cells were visualized by a BX51WI upright microscope (Olympus Co. Japan) equipped with infrared-DIC optics and a Cohu 4912 CCD camera (Cohu Inc. San Diego, CA) driven by a Scion Image for Windows Beta 4.0.2 software (Scion Co., Frederick, MD). The microscope and the micromanipulator were fitted to an S'Table antivibration table equipped with a Petra platform (Supertech Co., Hungary-Switzerland). The patch electrodes (OD&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;1.5mm, thin wall, Garner Co., U.S.A.) were pulled with a Flaming-Brown P-97 horizontal puller (Sutter Instrument Co., Novato, California, U.S.A.) and polished with an MF-830 microforge (Narishige). The resistance of the patch electrodes was 2&#x02013;3 M&#x003a9;.</p><p>The intracellular pipette solution used for electrophysiological recording contained HEPES 10 mM, K-gluconate 120 mM, KCl 10 mM, NaCl 1 mM, MgCl<sub>2</sub> 1 mM, EGTA 1 mM, Mg-ATP 2 mM, Na-GTP 0.3 mM, pH 7.25 with KOH, osmolarity was set to 290&#x02013;295 mOsm using D-sorbitol. In order to block intracellular calcium-dependent signal transduction pathways, intracellular calcium was chelated by substituting EGTA with 10 mM BAPTA (1,2-Bis(2-aminophenoxy)ethane-<italic>N,N,N&#x02032;,N&#x02032;</italic>-tetraacetic acid) in the intracellular pipette solution. When BAPTA was used in the intracellular solution, we waited 15 min after establishing a stable whole-cell clamp configuration in order to equilibrate the intracellular matrix and the electrode solution containing BAPTA. The holding potential was &#x02212;70 mV. Pipette offset potential, series resistance and capacitance were compensated before recording. Only cells with low leakage and stable baseline were used for electrophysiological measurements. The cells requiring any leak subtraction were omitted. The PVN parvocellular cells were identified in the acute brain slices by their apparent topographic location in the PVN. After establishing a stable whole-cell clamp configuration the cells were identified as neurons by evoking action potential by injecting &#x0002b;10pA current with &#x02212;10pA prepulse in current clamp mode. In order to block voltage sensitive Na-channels and inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) 1 &#x000b5;M tetrodotoxin (TTX, Tocris) and 100 &#x000b5;M picrotoxin (Sigma) were added to the aCSF 10 min before the start of recording of excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs). When the CB1-antagonist AM251 (1 &#x000b5;M, Tocris) or the DAG lipase inhibitor THL (tetrahydrolipstatin, 5 &#x000b5;M, Sigma) were used, they were added to the aCSF containing TTX and picrotoxin. In order to determine the effect of ghrelin, first a control measurement of the mEPSCs was carried out in a neuron. Then ghrelin (100 nM) was added to the aCSF and 15min later the mEPSCs were recorded again. Each recording lasted 258sec. In order to block excitatory inputs of the neurons examined, the glutamate receptor inhibitor kynurenic acid (5 mM, Sigma) was applied in the extracellular solution after recording control EPSCs.</p><p>In order to demonstrate the effect of ghrelin, four parameters of the mEPSCs were analyzed: <bold>amplitude</bold> of the pulses; the <bold>interevent interval</bold> representing the period between the peaks of the current and the previous event; the <bold>instantaneous frequency</bold> representing event frequency at the rate of the current and the previous event; and the <bold>event frequency</bold> representing event frequency over the entire data set (i.e. over the 258sec recording).</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data were analyzed using the Student's t-test, the ANOVA followed by the Newman-Keuls test or the Kruskal-Wallis test followed by Conover-Inman comparison, as appropriate (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA). Electrophysiological recordings were carried out on at least 8 cells for each experimental group. Baseline correction of the mEPSC recordings was carried out using the Corrector software (L. Tatai, G. L&#x00151;csei and B. Wittner, KOKI, Budapest). Event detection was performed using the Clampfit module of the PClamp 9.2 software (Molecular Devices, Union City, CA). Significance was taken at P&#x0003c;0.05. The data are expressed as mean&#x000b1;standard error (SEM), n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;6&#x02013;8 in each treatment group, except where differently specified.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We
