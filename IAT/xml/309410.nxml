Northern blot analysis showed that 3'rTS1 corresponded to a cytoplasmic 1.8 kb RNA found in several tumor cell lines. The remaining 5'region of this antisense RNA was cloned by a RACE (Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends) procedure. A full length cDNA (i.e., rTS, 1811 nt) was generated by splicing 3'rTS1 with RACE-generated cDNA. rTS RNA is likely a mRNA that contains four open reading frames. Based upon sequence analysis of the RACE cDNAs and the rTS cDNA, rTS RNA is likely processed from a gene containing at least six introns. Northern blot analysis indicates rTS RNA is expressed in a variety of human tumor cell lines and an aberrant from is expressed in a methotrexate-cell line.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00057-0070-a" xlink:role="1749"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00057-0071-a" xlink:role="1750"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00057-0068.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1747"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00057-0069.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1748"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00057-0070.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1749"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00057-0071.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1750"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00057-0072.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1751"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00057-0073.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1752"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
