RAV1 and RAV2 contain two distinct amino acid sequence domains found only in higher plant species. The N-terminal regions of RAV1 and RAV2 are homologous to the AP2 DNA-binding domain present in a family of transcription factors represented by the Arabidopsis APETALA2 and tobacco EREBP proteins, while the C-terminal region exhibits homology to the highly conserved C-terminal domain, designated B3, of VP1/ABI3 transcription factors. Binding site selection assays using a recombinant glutathione S-transferase fusion protein have revealed that RAV1 binds specifically to bipartite recognition sequences composed of two unrelated motifs, 5'-CAACA-3' and 5'-CACCTG-3', separated by various spacings in two different relative orientations. Analyses using various deletion derivatives of the RAV1 fusion protein show that the AP2 and B3-like domains of RAV1 bind autonomously to the CAACA and CACCTG motifs, respectively, and together achieve a high affinity and specificity of binding. From these results, we suggest that the AP2 and B3-like domains of RAV1 are connected by a highly flexible structure enabling the two domains to bind to the CAACA and CACCTG motifs in various spacings and orientations.</p></abstract></article-meta></front></article>
