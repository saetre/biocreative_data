GFI1 is upregulated in the earliest thymocyte precursors, while GFI1B expression is restricted to T lymphopoiesis stages coincident with activation. Transgenic expression of GFI1 potentiates T-cell activation, while forced GFI1B expression decreases activation. Both mice and humans with mutant <italic>Gfi1</italic> display lymphoid abnormalities. Here we describe autoregulation of <italic>Gfi1</italic> in primary mouse thymocytes and a human T-cell line. GFI1 binding to <italic>cis</italic>-element sequences conserved between rat, mouse and human <italic>Gfi1</italic> mediates direct and potent transcriptional repression. In addition, dramatic regulation of <italic>Gfi1</italic> can also be mediated by GFI1B. These data provide the first example of a gene directly targeted by GFI1 and GFI1B. Moreover, they support a role for auto- and trans-regulation of <italic>Gfi1</italic> by GFI1 and GFI1B in maintaining the normal expression patterns of <italic>Gfi1</italic>, and suggest that GFI1B may indirectly affect T-cell activation through repression of <italic>Gfi1</italic>.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Growth factor independence-1 (<italic>Gfi1</italic>) and <italic>Gfi1B</italic> are two closely related oncogenes that play different but pivotal roles in hematopoiesis. <italic>Gfi1</italic>-deficient mice display both thymic and peripheral T lymphopenia, with severe abnormalities in pre-T-cell development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh570c1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh570c3">3</xref>). Furthermore, mutation of <italic>Gfi1</italic> in humans induces defects in T lymphocyte function and development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh570c4">4</xref>). <italic>Gfi1B</italic> is necessary for the development of megakaryocytes and for definitive erythropoiesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh570c5">5</xref>). <italic>Gfi1B</italic> deficiency is embryonic lethal by day E15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh570c5">5</xref>). Subsequently, no thymic or T-cell phenotype has been reported for <italic>Gfi1B</italic> deficiency; however, forced expression of GFI1B induces perturbed T-cell development and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh570c6">6</xref>). In accordance with the distinct hematopoietic phenotypes of <italic>Gfi1</italic> and <italic>Gfi1B</italic> deficiency, one or the other factor is predominantly expressed in hematopoietic tissues of normal adult animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh570c7">7</xref>). <italic>Gfi1</italic> is highly expressed in thymus, the site of T-cell development, while <italic>Gfi1B</italic> is the predominant factor expressed in spleen. Both factors are expressed in bone marrow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh570c7">7</xref>).</p><p>The distinct physiological functions of <italic>Gfi1</italic> and <italic>Gfi1B</italic> may seem somewhat surprising given the similarities of their defined biochemical functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh570c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh570c8">8</xref>). GFI1 and GFI1B are two members of a family of zinc-finger transcriptional repressors that are characterized by the presence of the SNAG (found in the <underline>Sna</underline>il and <underline>G</underline>FI1 family of proteins) repression domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh570c8">8</xref>). Transcriptional repression by both GFI1 and GFI1B requires an intact SNAG domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh570c8">8</xref>). Specifically, transient transcription assays demonstrate that mutation of proline to alanine at amino acid 2 (P2A) ablates transcriptional repression of GFI1 and GFI1B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh570c8">8</xref>). Furthermore, having nearly identical zinc-finger DNA binding domains, GFI1 and GFI1B bind the same consensus DNA sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh570c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh570c9">9</xref>). Despite the extensive similarities of these proteins, each contains a region unique in amino acid sequence, the activities of which are yet to be defined. We therefore expect that these two factors have both redundant and unique biological roles in blood cell development.</p><p>GFI1 is expressed throughout T-cell development, and transgenic expression of GFI1 in T cells causes an increase in the response to activation mediated through the T-cell receptor (TCR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh570c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh570c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh570c11">11</xref>) or interleukin 2 (IL-2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh570c6">6</xref>). GFI1B is induced at stages of T lymphopoiesis that are coincident with TCR activation, and forced transgenic expression of GFI1B in T cells leads to decreased T-cell activation in both mature T cells <italic>in vitro</italic> and in thymocytes <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh570c6">6</xref>). While GFI1B transgenic mice display normal thymic cellularity, they share with <italic>Gfi1</italic>-deficient mice the characteristic of peripheral T lymphopenia. In addition, GFI1B transgenics display thymic abnormalities, including a defect in the formation of CD8 SP cells that can be partially corrected by simultaneous transgenic expression of GFI1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh570c6">6</xref>). Therefore, some of the observed GFI1B-mediated effects on T lymphopoiesis may result from the disruption of normal functions of GFI1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh570c6">6</xref>).</p><p>The antagonistic roles of GFI1 and GFI1B in T-cell biology might have been predicted from the frequency with which these two factors are activated in Moloney Murine Leukemia Virus (MoMLV)-induced T-cell tumors. <italic>Gfi1</italic> is the second most frequently activated target of MoMLV insertion mutagenesis in T-cell malignancies, leading to overexpression of wild-type <italic>Gfi1</italic>; however, <italic>Gfi1B</italic> is rarely activated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh570c12">12</xref>). Because overexpression of <italic>Gfi1</italic> is tumorigenic, we decided to examine the normal regulation of the <italic>Gfi1</italic>locus. Here we show that homologous regions of the rat, mouse and human <italic>Gfi1</italic> loci contain GFI1 recognition sequences that mediate autoregulation in both primary and transformed T lymphocytes. Moreover, such binding sites may also be targeted by GFI1B to repress <italic>Gfi1</italic> expression directly.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Mice</title><p>The GFI1 and GFI1B transgenic mice were as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh570c6">6</xref>).

The identification of <italic>Gfi1</italic> as an oncogene in rat T-cell leukemia lines provided a biological impetus for studying the transcriptional regulation of rat <italic>Gfi1</italic>. We therefore sought to examine the rat <italic>Gfi1</italic> locus for regions of transcriptional control. Genomic clones from the rat locus were analyzed by restriction endonuclease digestion, followed by Southern blotting with <italic>Gfi1</italic> cDNA probes and sequencing. We determined both the exon&#x02013;intron boundaries of the gene (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh570f1">1</xref>A) and the organization of the rat <italic>Gfi1</italic> locus (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh570f1">1</xref>B). Specifically, examination of the sequence of exon&#x02013;intron boundaries revealed the presence of seven exons and six introns. The exon&#x02013;intron boundary sequences are homologous to the previously published mouse locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh570c21">21</xref>), with minor exceptions. The genomic organization of rat <italic>Gfi1</italic> is shown as a diagram in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh570f1">1</xref>B and spans 9.5 kb of sequence. These data were corroborated by the recently available rat genomic sequence in DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank (data not shown).</p><p>To determine potential regulatory regions, DNase hypersensitivity assays were performed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh570f1">1</xref>C) with two different genomic probes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh570f1">1</xref>B, I and II). Analysis of the <italic>Gfi1</italic> locus in rat Nb2 and A2 leukemia cell lines with probe I revealed hypersensitive sites clustering around exon 1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh570f1">1</xref>B, arrows). Many of these sites occur within the first intron, but the major site of DNase hypersensitivity is just upstream of the first exon (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh570f1">1</xref>B, longer arrow, and C, arrow). In LE3Spl cells, two downstream hypersensitive sites were also identified with probe II (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh570f1">1</xref>C) and are indicated by arrows in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh570f1">1</xref>B. With either probe, the pattern of DNase hypersensitivity was similar with or without prolactin addition to prolactin-dependent Nb2 cells, and with or without IL-2 addition to the IL-2-dependent LE3Spl cell line (data not shown). Thus, these regulatory regions are unlikely to be growth-factor dependent.</p><p>We next mapped the start site of transcription of the rat <italic>Gfi1</italic> gene. The mouse <italic>Gfi1</italic> locus has both a major transcription start site 5&#x02032; of exon 1a, and a minor one in the first intron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh570c21">21</xref>). We therefore performed RNase protection analysis to locate the transcriptional start site(s) in the rat <italic>Gfi1</italic> gene. In RNA from rat Nb2 lymphoma cells, a sequence proximal to exon 1 was identified as the single start site of transcription in the rat <italic>Gfi1</italic> gene (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh570f2">2</xref>D). This sequence (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh570f1">1</xref>D, TCAGAGC) corresponds to the consensus sequence of an initiator element (Inr) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh570c22">22</xref>). Inr elements are commonly utilized as transcription start sites in TATA-less lymphoid-specific genes such as terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh570c23">23</xref>). In agreement with this, we found no evidence of a canonical TATA box in the sequence of this region. Moreover, the relative position of the Inr corresponds to the major site of DNaseI hypersensitivity. In contrast to both mouse and human <italic>Gfi1</italic>, which generate multiple sized transcripts, the rat locus generates a single transcript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh570c16">16</xref>). Unlike murine <italic>Gfi1</italic>, no start sites were detected in the first intron of the rat gene (data not shown).

The extent of sequence homology is unusual given that the nearest protein coding sequences are at least 1.6 kb distal, emphasizing the probable importance of this region in the transcriptional control of <italic>Gfi1</italic>.</p><p>The Inr sequence is conserved in the mouse locus, and is located near the previously mapped start site of transcription for mouse <italic>Gfi1</italic>.

Transcription factor binding sites conserved among all three species are illustrated (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh570f2">2</xref>). These include nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), interferon response factor 2 (IRF2) and GATA, all of which respond to exogenous signals in T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh570c26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh570c28">28</xref>). Additional putative regulatory sites include recognition sequences for E4BP4/NFIL3, HoxA9, SP-1, and the Ets factors ETS1 and ELK1. Strikingly, several putative GFI1 binding sites that are conserved between mouse, rat and human loci were identified (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh570f2">2</xref>). Alignment of sequences in the first intron of the rat locus with mouse and human <italic>Gfi1</italic> revealed extensive homology in rodents and two potential GFI1 binding sites (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Endogenous <italic>Gfi1</italic> is repressed by ectopic expression of GFI1 in murine primary thymocytes and in human Jurkat T cells</title><p>The presence of GFI1 recognition sequences in the <italic>Gfi1</italic> promoter suggested autoregulation.

We therefore examined the levels of endogenous <italic>Gfi1</italic> transcript in these GFI1-transgenic thymocytes. Northern analysis with a murine <italic>Gfi1</italic> 3&#x02032;-untranslated-region probe on Poly-A<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>-selected RNA from three GFI1-transgenic mouse thymi revealed an average 40&#x00025; reduction in the level of endogenous <italic>Gfi1</italic> transcript (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh570f3">3</xref>B). The modest effect on endogenous <italic>Gfi1</italic> levels is in accord with the low level of transgene expression. As expected, western blot analysis of thymocyte whole-cell lysates revealed similar levels of overall GFI1 protein in GFI1-transgenic and littermate control thymocytes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh570f3">3</xref>C). Analysis of CD2 promoter-driven GFI1 transgenic thymocytes revealed similar results (data not shown).</p><p>To determine if human <italic>Gfi1</italic> could be autoregulated, we transfected a human T-cell line (Jurkat) with a selectable marker and the <italic>Lck</italic>-promoter GFI1-transgene construct (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh570f3">3</xref>A), and selected stable clones. Northern analysis of Poly-A<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>-selected RNA with a human <italic>Gfi1</italic>-specific probe revealed profoundly reduced levels of endogenous <italic>Gfi1</italic> message in multiple independent GFI1-transfected clones, two of which are shown (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh570f3">3</xref>D). Western analysis confirmed high levels of GFI1 protein in the clones compared with control Jurkat cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh570f3">3</xref>E). To ensure that the observed repression is not the result of artifact induced by integration of the transgene or antisense generated by transgene concatemers, we repeated our analysis with independent clones of Jurkat T cells that were transduced with a GFI1-expressing retroviral vector (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh570f3">3</xref>F). Again, northern analysis revealed a profound decrease in endogenous <italic>Gfi1</italic> expression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh570f3">3</xref>G). Western analysis revealed increased expression of GFI1 in the transduced cell lines (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh570f3">3</xref>H). Therefore, both mouse and human <italic>Gfi1</italic> respond to the level of GFI1 in a manner consistent with autoregulation.</p></sec><sec><title>GFI1 binds to the <italic>Gfi1</italic> promoter in living Jurkat T cells</title><p>To determine a molecular basis for the regulation of <italic>Gfi1</italic> by forced GFI1 expression, we performed ChIP in Jurkat T cells. Cross-linked chromatin was immunoprecipitated with two independent antisera that are specific for GFI1. In templates generated from either antiserum immunoprecipitation, products of the amplification reaction were seen with primers directed to the rat/human homologous sequences in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh570f2">2</xref> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh570f3">3</xref>I, top and middle panels). In contrast, no product was seen in amplification reactions from control-antiserum templates (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh570f3">3</xref>I, top and middle panels), emphasizing the specificity of the immunoprecipitation. Furthermore, primers specific for a region of the <italic>Gfi1</italic> locus that does not contain GFI1 binding sites by our analyses did not amplify a product (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh570f3">3</xref>I, bottom panel). GFI1 is expressed in U937 myeloid monocytic cells and ChIP analyses have shown that it is bound to several promoters in this cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh570c20">20</xref>). Nonetheless, primers directed to the promoter of <italic>Gfi1</italic> failed to amplify a product from U937 chromatin that had been immunoprecipitated with goat anti-GFI1 antibody (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh570f3">3</xref>J), and forced expression of GFI1 in U937 cells did not lead to silencing of <italic>Gfi1</italic> transcription (data not shown). Therefore, in living Jurkat T cells, but not in U937 myeloid cells, GFI1 is specifically bound to the human <italic>Gfi1</italic> sequences shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh570f2">2</xref>.</p></sec><sec><title>GFI1 binds to sequences in the <italic>Gfi1</italic> promoter <italic>in vitro</italic></title><p>The GFI1/GFI1B consensus binding site is defined as TA<underline>AATC</underline>AC(A/T)GCA, with an absolute requirement for the AATC core (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh570c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh570c9">9</xref>). Mutation of AATC to GGTC ablates DNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh570c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh570c9">9</xref>). To determine which of the putative sites illustrated in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh570f2">2</xref> can be bound by GFI1, we designed 30&#x000a0;bp oligonucleotide probes for use in electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) with nuclear extracts from human Jurkat or rat NB2 cell lines (data not shown). Both extracts shifted the same probes. A synthetic GFI1 binding site that has been shown to be active in transient transcription assays (B30) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh570c8">8</xref>) was included for comparison. Incubation of Jurkat nuclear extract with the B30 probe resulted in the formation of two prominent protein&#x02013;DNA complexes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh570f4">4</xref>A, lane 2). As reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh570c9">9</xref>), excess unlabeled B30 oligonucleotide, but not excess &#x02018;AATC to GGTC&#x02019; mutant B30, was able to compete for binding to the radiolabeled B30 oligonucleotide (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh570f4">4</xref>A, lanes 3 and 4).</p><p>Several different protein&#x02013;DNA complexes were seen with individual probes from the mouse/rat/human homologous <italic>Gfi1</italic> sequences in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh570f2">2</xref>, most of which were relatively minor in intensity and did not display GFI1-specific interaction. For simplicity, these minor GFI1-non-specific sites are not shown. However, T-cell nuclear extracts retarded the mobility of probes containing sites labeled 2 and 4 in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh570f2">2</xref>, and the sites in the first intron (I) in a GFI1-dependent manner (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh570f4">4</xref>A, lanes 6, 11 and 16). Binding of both radiolabeled probes 2 and I was competed by adding excess unlabeled self or excess unlabeled B30, but not by adding excess unlabeled &#x02018;AATC to GGTC&#x02019; mutant B30 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh570f4">4</xref>A, lanes 7&#x02013;9 and 17&#x02013;19). Surprisingly, binding of Jurkat nuclear extract to radiolabeled probe 4 was competed only by adding excess unlabeled probe 4, and not by adding either excess unlabeled B30 or mutant B30 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh570f4">4</xref>A, lanes 12&#x02013;14). We therefore conclude that the probes bind to three distinct protein complexes, two of which recognize sequences in the B30 probe, the other of which does not.</p><p>To determine whether these complexes contain GFI1, we performed supershift and competition analysis on each of the three probes (2, 4 and I). Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh570f4">4</xref>B shows the results of these analyses performed with probe 2, which contains a single GFI1 binding site corresponding to &#x02013;701 of the rat promoter (relative to the Inr). This probe shifts in a doublet pattern in the presence of Jurkat nuclear extract (lane 2), and the shift was ablated when the nuclear extract was pre-incubated with anti-GFI1 antibody (lane 3), whereas a control antibody had no effect (lane 4). Furthermore, while binding was competed away in the presence of excess cold probe 2 (lane 5), there was no competition in the presence of excess cold mutant 2 (lane 6). When the mutant probe 2 was radiolabeled and used alone, the doublet was not seen (lane 7). To confirm that GFI1 binds directly to probe 2, we performed EMSA with IVT FLAG-epitope-tagged GFI1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh570f4">4</xref>B), or DNA-binding-deficient GFI1 (data not shown). IVT GFI1 formed a complex with probe 2 that migrated at a significantly higher rate than that of complexes formed with Jurkat nuclear extract (compare lanes 2 and 9). Furthermore, pre-incubation of IVT GFI1 with anti-FLAG antibody resulted in the formation of a supershift, while a control antibody had no effect (lanes 10 and 11, respectively). DNA-binding-defective IVT GFI1 did not form a complex with probe 2 (data not shown). Taken together, these data suggest that GFI1 in Jurkat nuclear extract binds directly to probe 2 in the context of a larger complex, rather than as a monomer.</p><p>The same analysis was performed with probe 4, which contains two GFI1 binding sites at &#x02013;434 and &#x02013;421 of the rat promoter. Pre-incubation of Jurkat nuclear extract with anti-GFI1 antibody abated complex formation, whereas a control antibody did not (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh570f4">4</xref>C, lanes 3 and 4), and pre-incubation of IVT GFI1 with anti-FLAG antibody resulted in a supershift, whereas a control antibody did not (lanes 14 and 15). These results are similar to those observed with probe 2. Further analysis revealed that only one of the two GFI1 binding sites is necessary for GFI1 from Jurkat nuclear extract to bind to probe 4. Each site was mutated independently (4a mutant &#x0003d; M1 and 4b mutant &#x0003d; M2) or both sites were mutated together (M3), and these mutants were used in competition analyses. Both wild-type and M2 oligonucleotides effectively competed away the complex (lanes 5 and 7), whereas M1 and M3 had no effect (lanes 6 and 8). Furthermore, when the mutant oligonucleotides were labeled and used as probes, M1 and M3 did not form a complex, while M2 formed the same complex as the wild-type probe 4. These analyses clearly demonstrate that only site 4a binds to GFI1 in Jurkat nuclear extract, and that site 4b is dispensable for this binding.</p><p>The same analysis was performed with probe I, which contains two GFI1 binding sites from the first intron of rat <italic>Gfi1</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh570f4">4</xref>D). These sequences are conserved between mouse and rat genes. The results of this analysis were similar to those obtained with probe 4. Pre-incubation with antibodies showed ablation of binding to Jurkat nuclear extract and supershift of IVT GFI1 (lanes 3 and 14, respectively), and competition analysis showed that only one of two putative GFI1 binding sites is necessary for the formation of complexes (lanes 5&#x02013;11). We therefore conclude that GFI1 in protein complexes can bind to cognate binding sites that are present in mouse/rat/human conserved sequences shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh570f2">2</xref>, and in the first intron that is conserved in rodent genomes.</p></sec><sec><title>GFI1 directly represses <italic>Gfi1</italic></title><p>To determine if the GFI1-binding sites in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh570f4">4</xref> mediate GFI1-responsive transcriptional repression, we performed transient transcription analyses. We constructed a CAT reporter driven by the rat <italic>Gfi1</italic> promoter and first intron (&#x02013;808 bp up to the beginning of exon 2), containing all of the DNase hypersensitive sites identified in the 5&#x02032; end of the gene (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh570f1">1</xref>). Co-transfection of 293T cells with this reporter and a GFI1-expression construct resulted in repression of reporter activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh570f5">5</xref>A). However, co-transfection with a plasmid encoding a SNAG-repression-domain mutant of GFI1 (P2A) had no effect (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh570f5">5</xref>A). Furthermore, co-transfection of this reporter with increasing amounts of a plasmid encoding a fusion protein that consists of the herpes simplex virus VP16 transactivator and the zinc fingers of GFI1 results in dose-dependent activation of the <italic>Gfi1</italic> reporter (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh570f5">5</xref>B). Therefore, the region of rat <italic>Gfi1</italic> containing the proximal promoter and first intron is capable of binding and being repressed by GFI1 in 293T cells.</p><p>To permit similar experiments in Jurkat T cells, we changed to a luciferase reporter. We constructed a Click Beetle Luciferase reporter with the rat <italic>Gfi1</italic> sequences (&#x02013;808 bp up to the beginning of exon 2). Co-transfection of this reporter with an expression plasmid encoding GFI1 resulted in a decrease of reporter activity to an average of 55&#x00025; of control. We next examined the requirement for sites 2, 4 and I, which bound GFI1-containing complexes during EMSA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh570f4">4</xref>). Surprisingly, mutation of either site 2 or site 4 individually had little or no effect on GFI1 repression. In contrast, mutation of both sites 2 and 4 decreased the GFI1-mediated repression of the reporter, such that the activity was an average of 75&#x00025; of the control. Furthermore, mutation of GFI1 binding site I also decreased GFI1-mediated repression to a level comparable to that seen in the site 2 and 4 double mutant. Finally, mutation of GFI1 binding sites 2, 4 and I resulted in a complete lack of exogenous GFI1-mediated repression of this luciferase reporter. We conclude that promoter or intronic sites are sufficient for GFI1-mediated repression, but all sites are necessary for efficient GFI1-mediated repression.</p></sec><sec><title>GFI1B binds directly to the <italic>Gfi1</italic> promoter and represses <italic>Gfi1</italic> in T cells</title><p>Transgenic expression of GFI1B (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh570f6">6</xref>A) engenders defects in T lymphopoiesis, some of which can be rescued by simultaneous forced expression of GFI1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh570c6">6</xref>). Because GFI1 and GFI1B have nearly identical DNA binding domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh570c7">7</xref>), we previously reasoned that GFI1B may alter T lymphopoiesis by competing with endogenous GFI1 for DNA binding on specific promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh570c6">6</xref>). We therefore sought to determine the extent to which transgenic expression of GFI1B disturbs the stoichiometry of GFI1/GFI1B in thymocytes. Dramatically, northern (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh570f6">6</xref>B) and western (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh570f6">6</xref>C) analysis of GFI1B-transgenic thymocytes revealed undetectable levels of GFI1. Thus, instead of competing with GFI1 for binding sites of target genes, transgenic GFI1B may occupy all of these binding sites in the absence of GFI1.</p><p>We next determined whether GFI1B directly represses <italic>Gfi1</italic> in a manner similar to GFI1. First, we examined Jurkat T cells cotransfected with the GFI1B transgene construct and a selectable marker. Northern analysis of independent clones revealed that ectopic expression of GFI1B in Jurkat cells resulted in repression of endogenous <italic>Gfi1</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh570f6">6</xref>D). Notably, higher levels of GFI1B protein correlated with lower levels of <italic>Gfi1</italic> message (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh570f6">6</xref>E). Next, we examined the ability of GFI1B to bind sites 2, 4 and I. In fact, IVT GFI1B binds efficiently to all three probes, as shown by EMSA analysis with supershift (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh570f6">6</xref>F). Moreover, like GFI1, GFI1B expression constructs are capable of repressing the <italic>Gfi1</italic>-CAT reporter in 293T cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh570f6">6</xref>G) and in Jurkat T cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh570f6">6</xref>H). Finally, this repression is abrogated upon mutation of the GFI1 binding sites 2, 4 and I (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh570f6">6</xref>H). Therefore GFI1B may also regulate <italic>Gfi1</italic> through the same sequences used by GFI1.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>GFI1 is a transcriptional repressor protein that plays important biological roles in hematopoietic and neuronal cell development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh570c1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh570c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh570c29">29</xref>). <italic>Gfi1</italic> was originally identified in a screen for genes that, upon deregulated expression by MoMLV insertion, engender progression of T-cell leukemias to IL-2-independent growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh570c16">16</xref>). While the frequency of MoMLV insertion in the <italic>Gfi1</italic> locus indicates some selective advantage of forced GFI1 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh570c12">12</xref>), validation of the oncogenic potential of GFI1 came from studies in transgenic mice. Transgenic overexpression of GFI1 is poorly oncogenic alone, but potently collaborates with either MoMLV infection or transgenic expression of MYC or PIM oncoproteins to cause leukemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh570c30">30</xref>). Therefore, cellular context may determine GFI1 oncogenic function. These data implicate GFI1 in T-cell biology. Indeed, mutation of <italic>Gfi1</italic>in mice and humans leads to lymphopenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh570c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh570c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh570c4">4</xref>). Since <italic>Gfi1</italic> expression is critical for normal hematopoiesis, and overcoming regulatory control of <italic>Gfi1</italic> accelerates oncogenesis, the transcriptional control of <italic>Gfi1</italic> is of great interest. Here we have shown that GFI1, and the closely related GFI1B, both repress transcription of <italic>Gfi1</italic>. This is the first example of a gene targeted directly by GFI1, and the first example of a gene targeted by both GFI1 and GFI1B.</p><p>We present several lines of evidence supporting a direct mechanism of <italic>Gfi1</italic> repression by GFI1. First, GFI1 binding sites in the rat <italic>Gfi1</italic> promoter are conserved in the mouse and human <italic>Gfi1</italic> loci. The conservation of these sequences is striking because the nearest coding sequence is at least 1.6 kb 3&#x02032; of the Inr. Secondly, in primary thymocytes, transgenic expression of GFI1 correlates with lower levels of endogenous <italic>Gfi1</italic> steady-state mRNA levels. Thirdly, in the human Jurkat T-cell line, forced overexpression of GFI1, either by the <italic>Lck</italic> promoter or retroviral LTR, correlates with reduced endogenous <italic>Gfi1</italic> steady-state mRNA levels. Fourthly, in EMSA analysis, <italic>in vitro</italic>-transcribed/-translated GFI1 and endogenous GFI1-containing nuclear complexes bind directly to sequences in <italic>Gfi1</italic>. Fifthly, mutation of these binding sites in reporter constructs ablates transcriptional response to GFI1 expression. Finally, ChIP analyses with two different antisera indicate that GFI1 binds specifically to mouse/rat/human conserved sequences in living Jurkat T cells. These <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> analyses provide strong support for the hypothesis that <italic>Gfi1</italic> is autoregulated. In fact, <italic>Gfi1</italic> autoregulation is evolutionarily conserved, as <italic>pag-3</italic>, the <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> ortholog of <italic>Gfi1</italic>, is autoregulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh570c31">31</xref>).</p><p>GFI1 binds to mouse/rat/human conserved sequences in living Jurkat T cells, but not in U937 myeloid cells. Interestingly, <italic>Gfi1</italic><sup>&#x02013;/&#x02013;</sup> mice, which completely lack GFI1, have severe lymphopenia and profound neutropenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh570c1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh570c3">3</xref>), while humans that carry a heterozygous dominant-negative mutation in <italic>Gfi1</italic> display severe congenital neutropenia (SCN), but only mild lymphopenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh570c4">4</xref>). It is possible that expression of mutant GFI1 proteins in SCN patient T cells might lead to de-repression of the wild-type <italic>Gfi1</italic> allele, providing compensatory expression of wild-type GFI1 and sufficient GFI1 activity in T cells. In contrast, the myeloid progenitor cell line U937 does not appear to exhibit <italic>Gfi1</italic> autoregulation. If similar myeloid cells in SCN patients do not have compensation by the wild-type <italic>Gfi1</italic> allele, then these cells would effectively lose most or all GFI1 function. This possibility warrants future investigation to determine if cell-type specific <italic>Gfi1</italic> autoregulation provides an explanation for the differences in phenotype observed in <italic>Gfi1</italic><sup><italic>&#x02013;/&#x02013;</italic></sup> mice when compared with SCN patients with a mutation in a single allele of <italic>Gfi1</italic>.</p><p>GFI1B can control <italic>Gfi1</italic> expression. The abilities of GFI1 and GFI1B to repress endogenous <italic>Gfi1</italic> seem comparable. Similar expression levels of the two factors in stably transfected Jurkat T cells resulted in similar repression. Both factors bound to the same DNA binding sites in EMSA analyses. Co-transfection of equal amounts of GFI1 and GFI1B expression plasmids with a <italic>Gfi1</italic> promoter-driven reporter resulted in nearly equal levels of repression in 293T cells, and the repression was dependent on the same binding sites in Jurkat T cells. Thus, GFI1B is capable of regulating <italic>Gfi1</italic>.</p><p>The repression of <italic>Gfi1</italic> by GFI1B potentially provides new insight into the transient expression of GFI1B in thymocytes that have been recently signaled for positive selection. Namely, GFI1B may be present to temporally repress <italic>Gfi1</italic>. Indeed, the expression of GFI1B during beta selection is followed by a decrease in GFI1 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh570c32">32</xref>). In contrast, forced expression of GFI1 in immature double-positive thymocytes has been shown to be detrimental, resulting in a block to beta selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh570c32">32</xref>). The coincident expression of GFI1B at this stage of development may be necessary to maintain appropriate levels of <italic>Gfi1</italic>, thereby allowing the progression through this critical checkpoint.</p><p>GFI1B antagonism to GFI1-mediated T-cell activation may be understood as follows. First, in normal thymocytes the expression level of GFI1B is sufficiently low such that it does not completely repress <italic>Gfi1</italic>, and both GFI1 and GFI1B are expressed. This simultaneous expression results in competition for DNA-binding sites on target genes, which would allow proper signaling and selection of developing thymocytes. However, transgenic expression of GFI1B disrupts GFI1/GFI1B stoichiometry and results in the complete repression of <italic>Gfi1</italic> transcription. Consequently, common target genes are occupied by GFI1B. Since GFI1 increases T-cell activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh570c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh570c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh570c11">11</xref>), GFI1B expression may indirectly inhibit T-cell activation through the repression of <italic>Gfi1</italic>. Additionally, GFI1B may have effects distinct from those of GFI1 on at least some target genes, as presumed occupancy by GFI1B does not necessarily result in the same effects as occupancy by GFI1.</p><p>The demonstration of GFI1 and GFI1B regulation of <italic>Gfi1</italic>, together with promoter analyses, suggests a very complex regulatory network controlling the expression of <italic>Gfi1</italic>. The extent of sequence homology between the rat <italic>Gfi1</italic> promoter and murine and human <italic>Gfi1</italic> loci emphasizes the probable importance of this region in the transcriptional control of <italic>Gfi1</italic>. Indeed, <italic>C.elegans</italic> and <italic>Caenorhabditis briggsae</italic> display extensive sequence homology in the promoter regions for the <italic>Gfi1</italic> ortholog <italic>pag-3</italic>, even though they diverged 20&#x02013;50 million years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh570c33">33</xref>). Thus, the GFI family may be conserved signal transduction proteins that mediate pathways initiated by other transcription factors.
