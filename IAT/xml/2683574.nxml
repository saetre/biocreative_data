Previous studies have shown that PINK1 influences both mitochondrial function and morphology although it is not clearly established which of these are primary events and which are secondary. Here, we describe a novel mechanism linking mitochondrial dysfunction and alterations in mitochondrial morphology related to PINK1. Cell lines were generated by stably transducing human dopaminergic M17 cells with lentiviral constructs that increased or knocked down PINK1. As in previous studies, PINK1 deficient cells have lower mitochondrial membrane potential and are more sensitive to the toxic effects of mitochondrial complex I inhibitors. We also show that wild-type PINK1, but not recessive mutant or kinase dead versions, protects against rotenone-induced mitochondrial fragmentation whereas PINK1 deficient cells show lower mitochondrial connectivity. Expression of dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) exaggerates PINK1 deficiency phenotypes and Drp1 RNAi rescues them. We also show that Drp1 is dephosphorylated in PINK1 deficient cells due to activation of the calcium-dependent phosphatase calcineurin. Accordingly, the calcineurin inhibitor FK506 blocks both Drp1 dephosphorylation and loss of mitochondrial integrity in PINK1 deficient cells but does not fully rescue mitochondrial membrane potential. We propose that alterations in mitochondrial connectivity in this system are secondary to functional effects on mitochondrial membrane potential.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="18"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Several inherited diseases have been identified that share the core clinical characteristics of rigidity, bradykinesia and resting tremor with Parkinson's disease (PD) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005701-Cookson1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

In contrast, measuring mitochondrial connectivity in mammalian cells, we find that decreasing Drp1 had a suppressive effect and, measuring fusion, we observed slower loss of pA-GFP in PINK1 deficient cells. One possible explanation for the apparent difference between our results, which are consistent with some other results in human neuroblastoma cell lines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005701-Exner1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005701-Dagda1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, and those in <italic>Drosophila</italic> models is that the effects of PINK1 on mitochondrial morphology are indirect. It has been suggested that excess fusion can buffer accumulated damage in parkin-deficient fly muscle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005701-McBride1">&#x0005b;58&#x0005d;</xref> and is a response to the damage rather than a cause.

If the primary event is accumulation of compromised mitochondria, then the effects on morphology are secondary and may vary depending on tissue type and stage. In the case of the mammalian cells used here, the output is a loss of connectivity due to secondary effects on Drp1.</p><p>Using electron microscopy, we see an approximate doubling in the number of cells with mitochondria that contained swollen cristae. Similar results are also seen in other cell lines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005701-Marongiu1">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref>, and in one recent study using EM an association of autophagic vacuoles with mitochondria with fewer cristae per unit length was noted <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005701-Dagda1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>.

Whether this is related to fission or fusion is unclear, as swelling might be independent of either process, but this does indicate that some aspects of mitochondrial dysfunction are conserved in different species when PINK1 is removed. It is also important to note that parkin can rescue PINK1 deficiency in both <italic>Drosophila</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005701-Clark1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005701-Park1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref> and in mammalian cell lines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005701-Exner1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005701-Dagda1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. However, there are clear species and/or tissue differences with respect to the effects of PINK1, as experiments in mouse brain have not revealed any obvious changes in mitochondrial morphology in the absence of exogenous stressors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005701-Gautier1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>It is possible that the effect of PINK1 is to influence mitochondrial fusion, in which case the effects of Drp1 would be antagonistic but indirect. In an attempt to address this directly, we used photoactivatable mitochondrially directed GFP and measured the rate of loss of pA-GFP, which should correlate to decreased rates of fusion. However, this data is not straightforward to interpret if PINK1 plays a role, for example, in mitochondrial transport. We have recently described that PINK1, probably on the cytoplasmic face of mitochondria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005701-Zhou1">&#x0005b;59&#x0005d;</xref>, interacts with Milton and Miro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005701-Weihofen1">&#x0005b;60&#x0005d;</xref>, two proteins involved in mitochondrial transport. Therefore, the decreased pA-GFP may relate to either a decreased mitochondrial transport rate, decreased mitochondrial fusion or both. Further experiments, perhaps using dual labeled mitochondria, are required to resolve this issue. However, what is relatively clear is that loss of PINK1 does not result in increased mitochondrial fusion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005701-Deng2">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>, at least in this model system.</p><p>An important point that arises from comparing different studies on mitochondrial function under circumstances where PINK1 activity has been depleted is that there are many different assays to address function and morphology of this complex organelle. In the current study, we principally used FRAP and pA-GFP as ways to interrogate mitochondria in living cells, which we chose so that we could avoid the influence of fixation or other processing steps. However, each of these methods has important advantages and disadvantages that should be considered in terms of the physical nature of mitochondria. For example, in some experiments we measured mitochondrial length and found that, as expected, lowering Drp1 levels increases mitochondrial length. However, at the light microscope level it is difficult to separate two nearby and juxtaposed mitochondria from one convoluted organelle, given their morphology. Therefore, we used FRAP to estimate total connected matrix volume, which is related to morphology and in our hands this is sensitive to relatively subtle changes. However, one of the limitations of this technique is the limited dynamic range and the wide variety of signal across different cells in a population, which necessitates measuring relatively large numbers of cells and validation by adding known fusion or fission molecules. As discussed above, the pA-GFP measures, which in principle should directly measure fusion, might also be influenced by mitochondrial transport. Therefore, our results need to be confirmed by different techniques performed in similar models. In this context, Dagda et al used a different estimate of mitochondrial connectivity, namely perimeter/area ratio measurements from fluorescently labeled mitochondria and found that PINK1 decreases connectivity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005701-Dagda1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Overall, our data support a role of PINK1 in limiting the damaging effects of loss of mitochondrial function.

For both blots, the vertical white between lanes 4 and 5 line shows where the blots were rearranged for clarity, but the images are from the same scan of the same blot and are thus comparable.</p><p>(1.54 MB TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0005701.s002.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0005701.s003"><label>Figure S3</label><caption><p>FRAP analyses in cell lines expressing alternate shRNA sequences.
