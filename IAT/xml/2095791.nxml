The human ortholog of this family consists of 98 amino acids and shares &#x0003e; 98% identity with its mammalian counterparts. This RNase is encoded by a single-copy gene found to be expressed in a wide spectrum of normal and cancer tissues. The cDNA of the human ribonuclease has been isolated and subcloned into a variety of prokaryotic expression vectors, but most efforts to express it caused a severe toxic effect. On the other hand, the expression of the human RNase by the use of the methylotrophic yeast <italic>Pichia pastoris</italic> system resulted in the production of a highly active recombinant enzyme. Using a 30-mer 5&#x02032;-end-labeled RNA probe as substrate, the purified enzyme seems to preferentially cleave ApU and ApG phosphodiester bonds, while it hydrolyzes UpU bonds at a lower rate. Based on amino acid sequence alignment and substrate specificity data, as well as the complete resistance of the recombinant protein to the placental ribonuclease inhibitor, we concluded that the human RNase &#x003ba; is a novel endoribonuclease distinct from other known ribonucleases.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="pdb"><title>Accession No.</title><kwd>AM746459</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>RNA molecules are endowed with a very special role in the mechanism of gene expression and therefore in cell differentiation. A very wide spectrum of enzymes known as RNases catalyzes the degradation of polymeric RNA and participates in a wide range of biological events in both the intracellular and extracellular level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). In recent years a focused study on RNases has led to the identification of novel ribonucleolytic enzymes in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, even though their biological role in most cases remains undefined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>).</p><p>The RNase A superfamily has been a subject of intense biochemical study for many decades. Dozens of novel members of the RNase A superfamily have been identified in multiple vertebrate species and their biochemical properties as well as their biological roles have been intensively studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3 B4 B5 B6 B7 B8 B9 B10 B11 B12 B13 B14">3&#x02013;14</xref>). Among the interesting features of this superfamily is its dynamic evolutionary history, which involved a series of gene duplications and advantageous amino acid substitutions.</p><p>Human RNases have been the epicenter of the interest in RNases for a long time. So far eight members of the RNase A superfamily have been studied in humans and despite the fact that they have been fully characterized in the biochemical level their <italic>in vivo</italic> activity remains obscure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). On the other hand human exoribonucleases have been studied less extensively, but have been shown to exhibit key roles in the processing and maturation of human RNA molecules. The members of the RNase A superfamily share a relatively high level of homology and their genes are located on human chromosome 14. In addition to their catalytic activity, members of this superfamily have been shown to possess important biological actions other than a simple digestive role. As examples, human RNase 5 (angiogenin) promotes blood vessel formation, while human RNase 2 (eosinophil-derived neurotoxin, EDN) and human RNase 3 (eosinophil cationic protein, ECP) exert neurotoxic, immunosuppressive and antiviral activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15 B16 B17">15&#x02013;17</xref>). In a recent publication, five new members of the RNase A superfamily have been identified by <italic>in silico</italic> analysis in humans, even though some of them seem to lack the catalytic amino acids and therefore do not bear ribonucleolytic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>).</p><p>In this work, we present the molecular cloning and characterization of a novel human endoribonuclease, designated as human RNase &#x003ba;, which belongs to a recently identified protein family. The first member of this family that has been studied is Cc RNase, isolated from the insect <italic>Ceratitis capitata</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Cc RNase is a small, thermolabile ribonuclease consisting of 95 amino acids, which degrades poly (U), poly (C) and rRNA. The human ortholog was expressed in bacteria and yeast and its study revealed that the recombinant protein displays ribonucleolytic activity, as also was observed in the case of Cc RNase.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title><p>Oligonucleotide synthesis and sequence analysis were performed by MWG Biotech (Ebersberg, Germany).

The recombinant enzyme degrades preferentially poly (U), while it degrades torula yeast RNA at a lower rate. No degradation of poly (C) was detected under the same experimental conditions, although some minor degradation of this substrate was observed after extended incubation times and increased enzyme concentrations.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>, lanes 4&#x02013;7, the ApU phosphodiester bond is mainly cleaved at the lowest enzyme concentration, while increase of the enzyme concentration enhances the cleavage of the ApG and UpU phosphodiester bonds.

Addition of the alkylating agent NEM or iodoacetamide does not inhibit the RNase activity of the recombinant enzyme in concentrations up to 50 mM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>, lanes 30 and 31). The purified enzyme seems to remain unaffected in the presence of Mg<sup>+2</sup> and Mn<sup>+2</sup>, while 2 mM Cu<sup>+2</sup> or Zn<sup>+2</sup> cause slight and total inhibition of its ribonucleolytic activity, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>, lanes 26&#x02013;29). Addition of the reducing agent DTT in concentrations &#x0003e; 5 mM causes its complete inactivation leading to the conclusion that the formation of disulfide bonds is essential for the retention of enzymatic activity. On the other hand, the presence of the placental ribonuclease inhibitor has no effect on the activity of the human RNase &#x003ba;, even at very high amounts (40 U) and limiting enzyme concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>, lanes 32&#x02013;35). This finding adds an additional argument to the fact that the RNase &#x003ba; family differs significantly from the well-characterized RNase A superfamily. The effect of temperature on ribonucleolytic activity was determined after preincubation of the recombinant enzyme at 37, 60 and 90&#x000b0;C for various time periods (data not shown). This experiment proved that the human RNase &#x003ba; is a thermolabile molecule, since it loses most of its activity after preincubation at 60&#x000b0;C for 10 min.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Ribonucleases can be considered as more than simple RNA digesting enzymes. They act as messenger molecules by interacting with actin, heparin and proteoglycans and influence a wide range of functions. Their degrading action on mRNA molecules has been under scrutiny for a number of years, as this procedure seems to play an important role in gene expression or translational control and therefore in cell differentiation. Besides their digestive role many RNases exhibit anti-tumor and cytotoxic activity, while others exert aspermatogenic, anti-embryonic, anti-bacterial, anti-viral or immunosuppressive actions. In our previous work, we presented a novel RNase, Cc RNase, isolated from the insect <italic>Ceratitis capitata</italic>, which belongs to a novel highly conserved protein family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>).</p><p>In this work, we report the isolation and characterization of a cDNA clone encoding the human counterpart of the RNase &#x003ba; (kappa) family along with the expression and biochemical characterization of the recombinant enzyme. Search of EST sequences databases, belonging to a variety of different organisms, proved that the RNase &#x003ba; family is represented by a single ortholog in metazoans expanding from <italic>C. elegans</italic> to humans, while no representatives have been detected so far in yeast, plants and bacteria. All members of this family are small proteins with polypeptide chains consisting of 95&#x02013;101 amino acids and have no significant similarity to other known ribonucleases. It is important to note that all members of this family seem to be highly conserved with a conservation rate that in mammals reaches a percentage &#x0003e; 98%. This extremely high conservation can be compared only to the increased conservation rates exhibited by members of other protein families with very significant biological roles, such as the histones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>) or phosphofructokinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>).</p><p>As far as the genomic organization of the human RNase &#x003ba; is concerned, the human RNase &#x003ba; gene is represented by a single copy in the human genome and retains the pattern of gene organization that is preserved by all known members of the gene family, consisting of three exons interrupted by two introns.</p><p>Northern blot analysis resulted in the detection of a main mRNA of the human RNase &#x003ba; exhibiting a length of 700 kb in all tissues examined. Two longer transcripts of 3.1 and 5 kb were found only in brain, placenta and pancreas, while a third one with a length of 1.6 kb expressed in B cells (Ramos cell line) has already been submitted in the databank (Acc No. CR607998.1). Analysis of the retrieved EST sequences revealed that the human RNase &#x003ba; mRNA is expressed in almost every human tissue and developmental stage. This finding suggests a basic housekeeping cellular function for this protein. Concerning the breakdown of EST sequences of the human RNase &#x003ba; by health state, &#x0223c;75% of them are represented in cancer tissues while the rest in normal tissues.</p><p>In most cases, the expression of the human RNase &#x003ba; in bacteria caused a severe toxic effect, resulting either in the production of no transformants or in the inhibition of cell growth and death of the transformed <italic>E. coli</italic> cultures following IPTG induction. It is already known that the expression of many human recombinant RNases with important biological actions, such as ECP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>) or human RNase 7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>) produces similar toxic effects. The toxic effect produced by the expression of the human RNase &#x003ba; was not eliminated even when host cells, which produce lysozyme as an additional means of reducing basal expression of the recombinant protein or the expression system of the bacteriophage CE6 were used. It is therefore possible that the production of even a small amount of the recombinant protein is sufficient to cause a severe toxic effect in <italic>E. coli</italic>. The successful expression of the human RNase &#x003ba; in bacteria was achieved only after the recombinant molecule was expressed as a fusion protein. While this expression system produced a large amount of insoluble fusion protein, an extremely low amount of soluble human RNase &#x003ba;, which exhibited very little ribonucleolytic activity, yielded after purification.</p><p>Therefore, in order to express the human RNase &#x003ba;, the methylotrophic yeast <italic>P. pastoris</italic> expression system, which has been previously used successfully for the expression of other toxic ribonucleases, such as the a-sarcin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>) or onconase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>), was employed. Using this system, the production of a highly active recombinant ribonucleolytic enzyme was accomplished. Even though the calculated molecular weight of the secreted recombinant protein is almost 14 kDa, the purified protein displays a molecular mass of 19 kDa as estimated by SDS&#x02013;PAGE. Despite this deviation the identity of the recombinant protein is unquestionable, since the 19 kDa protein exhibits ribonucleolytic activity, immunoreacts with the polyclonal antibody raised against a specific oligopeptide of the human RNase &#x003ba; as well as with the monoclonal anti-His tag antibody and yields the expected peptide mapping profile as resulted by ESI-MS and MALDI-MS analysis. Since the results obtained from the peptide analysis did not report identification of modified amino acids, the observed difference among the theoretical and experimental molecular weights could probably be attributed to an abnormal electrophoretic mobility of the recombinant protein, as has been previously reported in the case of the recombinant ribonuclease U<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>).</p><p>As far as the catalytic mechanism employed by the human RNase &#x003ba; in the degradation of RNA is concerned, the existence of one histidine residue (His36) in its amino acid sequence raises a significant point as to whether this residue can take part in the catalytic mechanism. Two histidine residues participate in acid&#x02013;base catalysis caused by all members of the RNase A superfamily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>), whereas one histidine and one acidic amino acid are necessary for the degradation of RNA from the fungal RNase T<sub>1</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). On the other hand, there are also ribonucleases such as RNase III and RNase H type II, by which RNA catalysis is carried out by acidic amino acid residues only (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38 B39">38&#x02013;39</xref>). Although experimental data concerning the catalytic mechanism of the human RNase &#x003ba; have not been obtained so far, residues Lys10, Asp43, Tyr62, Tyr76, Gln86 and Asn90 of the human enzyme are found to be conserved in all family members studied, therefore indicating a possible participation in catalysis or in RNA base-specific recognition.</p><p>The human RNase &#x003ba; contains five cysteine residues, three of which Cys7, Cys14 and Cys69 are conserved among all species examined. The finding that the recombinant enzyme loses its activity by the addition of DTT in the reaction mixture, while it remains fully active in the presence of <italic>N</italic>-ethylmaleimide or iodoacetamide leads us to the conclusion that cysteine residues are not necessary for RNA catalysis, but stabilize the protein by the formation of at least one disulfide bond.</p><p>Base specificity experiments indicated that the human RNase &#x003ba; is probably a single-strand-specific endoribonuclease that preferentially cleaves ApU and ApG phosphodiester bonds, while it hydrolyzes UpU bonds at a lower rate. This novel RNase has no obvious relationship with the pancreatic RNase family enzymes and seems more similar to other human RNases, like RNase T84 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>), RNase L (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>) or RNase 4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>). However, these enzymes recognize different dinucleotides than the human RNase &#x003ba;. For example, RNase T84 catalyzes the hydrolysis of ApU and GpU phosphodiester bonds, RNase L catalyzes the cleavage of UpU, UpA, UpG, ApA and ApU, while RNase 4 hydrolyzes the phosphodiester bonds of UpA and UpG.</p><p>Human RNase &#x003ba; sequence specificity also differs from the specificity for G and A nucleotides known for fungal RNases, RNase T<sub>1</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>) and RNase U<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>), respectively. Furthermore, it seems to differ from the fungal RNase Phy M (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>), which cleaves RNA after U and A nucleotides. The latter enzymes recognize all guanosine, adenine or uracil nucleotides in the single-stranded RNA regions and do not require a following nucleotide.</p><p>A comparison of the human RNase &#x003ba; with its previously characterized <italic>C. capitata</italic> counterpart has displayed a number of significant similarities between them. The human protein is three amino acids longer consisting of 98 amino acids and displays 40% identity in the amino acid level with Cc RNase. Most of our efforts to express these proteins in prokaryotic systems resulted either in lack of transformants or severe cell death following IPTG induction, thus indicating that the production of either of these RNases is toxic to <italic>E. coli</italic>. In both cases successful expression was achieved only by the use of the pSCREEN 1b<bold>(+)</bold> vector, by which the target RNases are expressed as fusion proteins. Even though the use of this system produced satisfactory amounts of recombinant fusion proteins, ribonucleolytically active mature protein yielded only in the case of Cc RNase. The biochemical characterization of the human and insect protein family representatives has proved that both enzymes hydrolyze native and synthetic RNAs at the same pH range, are thermolabile and are inhibited by Zn<sup>+2</sup>. Reduction of their disulfide bonds results in their complete inactivation indicating that the formation of at least one disulfide bond is essential for their catalytic activity. Concerning the nucleotide base specificity both enzymes cleave UpU phosphodiester bonds, while Cc RNase cleaves CpC bonds more effectively compared to its human counterpart. Even though the ribonucleolytic activity of Cc RNase has been characterized only by the use of homopolymers, the finding that the human RNase &#x003ba; displays a deviated specificity is not unusual since similar data have been also reported in the case of other RNase families. For example, frog ribonucleases of the RNase A superfamily display a preference for the hydrolysis of pyrimidine-G phosphodiester bonds compared to the preference for pyrimidine-A phosphodiester bonds displayed by their mammalian counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>). Furthermore, it is known that the specificity of dinucleotide cleavage by angiogenins differs among distinct family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>). Additionally, the RNase T<sub>1</sub> variant RV, bearing only five amino acid substitutions, exhibits a stronger preference toward adenosine residues than wild-type RNase T<sub>1</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>).</p><p>In summary, the characterization of the human RNase &#x003ba; as the second member of a novel RNase family establishes the identification of the RNase &#x003ba; family in metazoans. The nucleotide base specificity of the recombinant human representative, its lack of any significant homology to the members of the RNase A family and the fact that the human counterpart evades the placental ribonuclease inhibitor prove that there is no evolutionary relationship between RNase A and &#x003ba; families. The high conservation of all members of this RNase family in combination with the fact that the human enzyme is found to be expressed in all developmental stages and tissues suggest a very important biological function, which remains to be elucidated. Additionally, since it is well known that a number of human RNases are involved with pathogenic conditions, like autoimmune diseases, inflammatory disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>) or inhibition of tumor growth and metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>), a possible participation of the human RNase &#x003ba; in the occurrence of such pathological situations would be intriguing to be explored.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>This work is part of Ph.D. thesis of Ms E.A.M. and was supported by the Hellenic State Scholarship's Foundation and a Faculty Research Grant from the National Kapodistrian University of Athens.
