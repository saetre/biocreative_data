Glutamate and neuropeptide receptors in the CeLC contribute to synaptic and behavioral changes in the arthritis pain model, but the intracellular signaling pathways remain to be determined. This study addressed the role of PKA, PKC, and ERK in the CeLC. Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were used in all experiments. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of CeLC neurons were made in brain slices from normal rats and from rats with a kaolin/carrageenan-induced monoarthritis in the knee (6 h postinduction). Membrane-permeable inhibitors of PKA (KT5720, 1 &#x003bc;M; cAMPS-Rp, 10 &#x003bc;M) and ERK (U0126, 1 &#x003bc;M) activation inhibited synaptic plasticity in slices from arthritic rats but had no effect on normal transmission in control slices. A PKC inhibitor (GF109203x, 1 &#x003bc;M) and an inactive structural analogue of U0126 (U0124, 1 &#x003bc;M) had no effect. The NMDA receptor-mediated synaptic component was inhibited by KT5720 or U0126; their combined application had additive effects. U0126 did not inhibit synaptic facilitation by forskolin-induced PKA-activation. Administration of KT5720 (100 &#x003bc;M, concentration in microdialysis probe) or U0126 (100 &#x003bc;M) into the CeLC, but not striatum (placement control), inhibited audible and ultrasonic vocalizations and spinal reflexes of arthritic rats but had no effect in normal animals. GF109203x (100 &#x003bc;M) and U0124 (100 &#x003bc;M) did not affect pain behavior. The data suggest that in the amygdala PKA and ERK, but not PKC, contribute to pain-related synaptic facilitation and behavior by increasing NMDA receptor function through independent signaling pathways.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>The present study focused on the role of intracellular signaling mechanisms in the amygdala in pain-related plasticity and behavior. The amygdala is now recognized as an important player in the emotional-affective dimension of pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The laterocapsular division of the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeLC) is of particular importance, because it receives nociceptive ("pain-related") information directly from spinal cord and brainstem and indirectly, through the lateral-basolateral amygdala circuitry, from thalamus and cortex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Our previous studies demonstrated central sensitization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and synaptic plasticity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] in the CeLC in the kaolin/carrageenan-induced arthritis pain model. Recent imaging data also showed increased amygdala activation related to knee pain in patients with osteoarthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Pain-related synaptic plasticity in the CeLC was confirmed in a model of chronic neuropathic pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] and was mimicked by tetanic stimulation of presumed nociceptive inputs from the brainstem [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>A consequence of pain-related amygdala activation is increased pain behavior. Deactivation of the central nucleus decreased nocifensive and affective behavior associated with arthritic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], formalin-induced [[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]; but see Tanimoto et al., 2003], visceral [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], and neuropathic pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. However, the amygdala is also important for pain inhibition, particularly in the context of stress-induced and conditioned forms of analgesia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. The conditions under which the amygdala assumes pro- or anti-nociceptive functions and the underlying mechanisms remain to be determined.</p><p>Arthritis pain-related synaptic plasticity and central sensitization in the CeLC require the upregulation of presynaptic metabotropic glutamate receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] and increased postsynaptic NMDA receptor function through a mechanism that involves NR1 phosphorylation by PKA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Pain-related PKA activation in the CeLC appears to occur downstream of calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor CGRP1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and corticotropin-releasing factor receptor CRF1[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Protein kinases such as PKA, PKC, and ERK, play important roles in the central sensitization of spinal cord neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. The effects of PKA and PKC activators on spinal transmission and excitability were blocked by inhibitors of ERK signaling, suggesting that PKA and PKC are upstream activators of ERK in the spinal cord [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>].</p><p>Pain-related functions and interactions of protein kinases, including PKA, PKC, and ERK, in the amygdala are largely unknown. A recent biochemical and behavioral study showed ERK activation in the CeLC in the formalin pain model and antinociceptive effects of inhibiting ERK activation in the CeLC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The present study used a multidisciplinary approach at the cellular and system levels to determine the effects of selective inhibitors of PKA, PKC, and ERK in the amygdala on pain-related synaptic plasticity and behavior. We focused on these protein kinases because they are important for spinal central sensitization and can phosphorylate the NMDA receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>], which is a critical mechanism of arthritis pain-related plasticity in the amygdala [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>All experimental procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Use and Care Committee (IACUC) at the University of Texas Medical Branch and conform to guidelines of the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) and of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Electrophysiological and behavioral data were obtained from normal rats (n = 34) and from rats with an acute monoarthritis (n = 60; see below). Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (120&#x02013;250 g) were used for all experiments, 94 animals in total. Rats were individually housed in standard plastic boxes (40 &#x000d7; 20 cm) in a temperature-controlled room and maintained on a 12 h day and night cycle. Standard laboratory chow and tap water was continuously available. On the day of the experiment, rats were transferred from the animal facility and allowed to acclimate to the laboratory for at least 1 h.</p><sec><title>Arthritis pain model</title><p>In some animals (n = 60) a localized mono-arthritis was induced in the left knee. For arthritis induction, animals were briefly (for 20 min) anesthetized either with the short-acting barbiturate sodium methohexital (Brevital<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, 50 mg/kg, i.p.) or with 5% isoflurane (1-chloro-2,2,2-trifluoroethyl difluoromethyl ether; Hospira Inc. Lake Forest, IL, USA) using an Ohio Isoflurane Vaporizer (100F model). Since no differences in electrophysiological and behavioral changes were found, data were pooled. A kaolin suspension (4%, 80&#x02013;100 &#x003bc;l) was injected into the joint cavity through the patellar ligament with a syringe (1 ml, 25 G5/8). After repetitive flexions and extensions of the knee for 15 min, a carrageenan solution (2%, 80&#x02013;100 &#x003bc;l) was injected into the knee joint cavity and the leg was flexed and extended for another 5 min. This treatment paradigm reliably leads to inflammation and swelling of the knee within 1&#x02013;3 h, reaches a maximum plateau at 5&#x02013;6 h, and persists for days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. The monoarthritis is strictly confined to the knee; it does not spread and become systemic; and it is a use-dependent pain model, i.e., signs of "spontaneous" pain are typically not observed in the absence of external stimulation or movement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Animals recovered quickly and were closely monitored for any signs of distress, using a "Quantitative Assessment for Pain and Distress Chart" provided by our IACUC. Parameters included overall appearance, breathing patterns, grooming behavior, locomotion around the cage, water and food consumption, spontaneous vocalizations, and interactions with the investigator. Electrophysiological and behavioral measurements of arthritis pain-related changes were made 6 h after arthritis induction (plateau phase, see above). During the development of arthritis the animals were without the benefit of anesthesia or analgesics. The addition of any analgesics or continuous anesthesia would preclude the measurement of pain-related behavior and affect neuronal activity in the brain slice by chemical contamination to such extent that it would invalidate the data and confound the results and interpretation.</p></sec><sec><title>Electrophysiology: patch clamp recording</title><sec><title>Amygdala slice preparation</title><p>Brain slices containing the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) were obtained from 51 rats. Rats were decapitated without the use of anesthesia to avoid chemical contamination of the tissue. The brain was quickly dissected out and blocked in cold (4&#x000b0;C) artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF). ACSF contained (in mM): NaCl 117, KCl 4.7, NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4 </sub>1.2, CaCl<sub>2 </sub>2.5, MgCl<sub>2 </sub>1.2, NaHCO<sub>3 </sub>25, and glucose 11. ACSF was oxygenated and equilibrated to pH 7.4 with a mixture of 95% O<sub>2</sub>/5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Coronal brain slices (500 &#x003bc;m) were prepared using a Vibroslice (Camden Instruments, London, UK). After incubation in ACSF at room temperature (21&#x000b0;C) for at least 1 h, a single brain slice was transferred to the recording chamber and submerged in ACSF (31 &#x000b1; 1&#x000b0;C), which perfused the slice at a rate of ~2 ml/min. Only 1&#x02013;2 brain slices per animal were used, and only 1 neuron was recorded in each slice. Unless otherwise stated, numbers in the manuscript refer to the number of neurons tested for each parameter.</p></sec><sec><title>Whole-cell patch-clamp recording</title><p>Recordings were made in the right amygdala because our previous electrophysiological in vivo and in vitro studies showed pain-related plasticity in the right amygdala [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>] and our behavioral data indicated that the right amygdala is coupled to pain facilitation in the arthritis pain model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. This is consistent with a strong contralateral projection of the spino-parabrachio-amygdaloid pain pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>] (arthritis was induced in the left knee).</p><p>Whole-cell recordings using the "blind" patch technique were obtained from neurons in the latero-capsular division of the CeA (CeLC) as described before [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The different nuclei of the amygdala and the CeA subdivisions are easily discerned under the microscope. Patch electrodes (4&#x02013;6 M&#x003a9; tip resistance) were made from borosilicate glass capillaries (1.5 mm and 1.12 mm, outer and inner diameter, respectively; Drummond, Broomall, PA), using a Flaming-Brown micropipette puller (P-80/PC, Sutter Instrument Co., Novato, CA). The internal solution of the recording electrodes contained (in mM): 122 K-gluconate, 5 NaCl, 0.3 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 EGTA, 10 HEPES, 5 Na<sub>2</sub>-ATP, 0.4 Na<sub>3</sub>-GTP; pH was adjusted to 7.2&#x02013;7.3 with KOH and the osmolarity to 280 mOsm/kg with sucrose. After tight (&#x0003e;2 G&#x003a9;) seals were formed and the whole-cell configuration was obtained, neurons were included in the sample if the resting membrane potential was more negative than -50 mV and action potentials overshooting 0 mV were evoked by direct depolarizing current injections.</p><p>Voltage and current signals were low-pass filtered at 1 kHz with a dual 4-pole Bessel filter (Warner Instrument Corp., Hamden, CT), digitized at 5 kHz (Digidata 1322A interface, Axon Instr., Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA), and stored on a computer (Dell Pentium 4). Data were also continuously recorded on an ink chart recorder (Gould 3400, Gould Instr., Valley View, OH). Current- and voltage-clamp (d-SEVC) recordings were made using an Axoclamp-2B amplifier (Axon Instr.) with a switching frequency of 5&#x02013;6 kHz (30% duty cycle), gain of 3&#x02013;8 nA/mV, and time constant of 20 ms. Phase shift and anti-alias filter were optimized. The headstage voltage was monitored continuously on a digital oscilloscope (Gould 400, Gould Instr.) to ensure precise performance of the amplifier. If series resistance (monitored with pCLAMP9 software, Axon Instr.) changed more than 10%, the neuron was discarded. Voltage- and current data were analyzed with pCLAMP9 software (Axon Instruments). Neurons were voltage-clamped at -60 mV except for the analysis of NMDA receptor-mediated synaptic transmission (recorded at +20 mV).</p></sec><sec><title>Synaptic stimulation</title><p>Using two concentric bipolar stimulating electrodes (SNE-100, Kopf Instr.; 22 k&#x003a9;), monosynaptic excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) were evoked in CeLC neurons by electrical stimulation (using a Grass S88 stimulator) of two distinct lines of input [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]: the <underline>PB-CeLC synapse</underline>, which contains afferents from the lateral parabrachial area and provides presumed nociceptive input from the spino-parabrachio-amygdaloid pain pathway, and the <underline>BLA-CeLC synapse</underline>, which transmits highly integrated polymodal information from thalamic and cortical areas and is part of the fear/anxiety circuitry. For stimulation of the PB-CeLC synapse, the electrode was positioned under microscopic control on the afferent fiber tract from the lateral PB, which runs dorsomedial to the CeA and ventral to but outside of the caudate-putamen. In the vicinity of this tract, no other afferents to the CeA have been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. Electrical stimuli (150 &#x003bc;s square-wave pulses) were delivered at low frequencies (&#x0003c;0.25 Hz). Input-output functions were obtained by increasing the stimulus intensity in 100 &#x003bc;A steps (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). For evaluation of a drug effect on synaptically evoked responses, the stimulus intensity was adjusted to 75&#x02013;80% of the intensity required for orthodromic spike generation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Synaptic plasticity in CeLC neurons in the arthritis pain model</bold>. Input-output functions of CeLC neurons were measured in slices from arthritic animals (6 h postinduction) and in slices from normal animals. Monosynaptic excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) were evoked in CeLC neurons by electrical stimulation of the PB-CeLC (<bold>A</bold>) and BLA-CeLC (<bold>B</bold>) synapses with increasing intensities. Input-output curves were generated by plotting peak EPSC amplitude (pA) as a function of afferent fiber volley stimulus intensity (&#x003bc;A). Input-output functions of neurons from arthritic animals (n = 19) were significantly different from those of control neurons (n = 16) at the PB-CeLC (P &#x0003c; 0.0001, F <sub>1,363 </sub>= 66.65) and BLA-CeLC (P &#x0003c; 0.0001, F <sub>1,363 </sub>= 43.30, two-way ANOVA) synapses. Individual traces (mean of 8&#x02013;10 trials) show monosynaptic EPSCs recorded in one CeLC neuron from a normal rat and another CeLC neuron from an arthritic rat.

Inhibition of PKA or ERK, but not PKC, in the CeLC decreases NMDA receptor-mediated synaptic plasticity in the arthritis pain model but has no effect on basal transmission under normal conditions. PKA and ERK inhibitors administered together do not occlude each other's action but have additive effects, suggesting independent signaling pathways for PKA and ERK. PKA activation by forskolin under normal conditions induces an NMDA receptor-mediated synaptic component that mimics synaptic facilitation observed in the arthritis model. This effect is not blocked by the inhibition of ERK activation, arguing against a role of ERK downstream of PKA. Consequently, inhibitors of PKA and ERK, but not PKC, in the CeLC decrease supraspinally (vocalizations) and spinally (withdrawal reflexes) organized pain behaviors in animals with arthritis but not in normal animals.</p><p>The significance of these results is that in the amygdala PKA and ERK, but not PKC, modulate information processing and behavior through separate (not serially arranged) signaling pathways. This is different from pain-related plasticity in the spinal cord [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] and from other models of plasticity such as hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>], where PKA and PKC act in concert to activate ERK. In dorsal horn neurons activation of PKA, PKC, or ERK increased neuronal excitability and inhibited transient potassium (A-type) currents. The effects of PKA and PKC activators were blocked by inhibitors of ERK signaling, suggesting that PKA and PKC act as upstream activators of ERK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Spinal PKA and PKC activation has also been implicated in central sensitization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>] and behavioral hypersensitivity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>] in different pain models. More recent studies showed ERK activation and antinociceptive effects of ERK inhibition in the spinal cord in several pain models [reviewed by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]]. The lack of evidence for the involvement of PKC in the present study was somewhat surprising. However it has been pointed out before that "studies on the effects of PKC on NMDA receptors have yielded conflicting results, probably because PKC has multiple effects depending on cell type, sites of action, and variable associations of NMDA receptors with other proteins" [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>].</p><p>Our data suggest that NMDA receptors are the target of PKA and ERK. NMDA receptors have been shown to function as "upstream" activators of protein kinases. NMDA receptors couple directly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>] or via PKA and PKC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>] to ERK activation and are involved in pain-related ERK activation in the spinal dorsal horn [see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]]. NMDA receptor dependent ERK activation plays an important role in the central sensitization of dorsal horn neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>]. However, NMDA receptors are also "downstream" targets of protein kinases. PKA, PKC, and ERK can phosphorylate NMDA receptors to enhance current flow through the receptor and accelerate the kinetics of the ion channel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>]. PKC mediated NMDA receptor phosphorylation removes the magnesium block [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">72</xref>], rendering the channel functional even at normal resting membrane potentials as observed in the present study. Pain-related NMDA receptor phosphorylation of spinothalamic tract (STT) cells in the deep dorsal horn requires both PKC and PKA, whereas phosphorylation in superficial dorsal horn STT cells is due to the action of PKA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">73</xref>]. The contribution of ERK-mediated NMDA receptor phosphorylation to pain-related neuronal and behavioral changes remains to be determined, but a recent study showed ERK-mediated NMDA receptor phosphorylation by brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which can modulate nociceptive transmission in the spinal dorsal horn [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>].</p><p>The effectiveness of protein kinase inhibitors in the present study suggests tonic NMDA receptor phosphorylation in amygdala neurons in the arthritis pain state. Kinetics of phosphorylation by PKA and ERK are fast (1&#x02013;5 min) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. PKA can overcome constitutive protein phosphatase activity and rapidly enhance NMDA receptor currents [see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]]. Blocking phosphorylation with PKA and ERK inhibitors would shift the balance from phosphorylation toward dephosphorylation by constitutively active phosphatases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>]. For example, type I protein phosphatase (PP1) binds to an NMDA receptor-associated protein and decreases current flow through the channel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>]. Striatal enriched tyrosine phosphatase (STEP) is a component of the NMDA receptor complex and can prevent hippocampal LTP without affecting normal synaptic transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">74</xref>]. STEP immunoreactivity is found in cell bodies in several brain areas, including the amygdala [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">75</xref>]. Therefore, the negative regulation of NMDA receptor function by protein kinase inhibitors in the present study can be explained by the relative dominance of constitutively active phosphates.</p><p>The mechanisms leading to pain-related PKA and ERK activation in the amygdala remain to be determined. A variety of neuromodulator/neurotransmitter receptors, including metabotropic glutamate receptors that are important for pain-related plasticity in the amygdala [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], have been shown to couple to ERK activation via PKA and PKC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>]. Evidence from our previous studies suggests that neuropeptide receptors CGRP1 and CRF1 contribute to pain-related changes in the amygdala through a mechanism that involves PKA activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. If PKA and ERK are indeed activated through different mechanisms as the present study may suggest, neuropeptide receptors could activate PKA whereas metabotropic glutamate receptors could couple to ERK activation.</p><p>Some methodological aspects need to be considered. The conclusions of this study rely on the selectivity of the protein kinase inhibitors. The role of PKA was determined by using two compounds that inhibit PKA activation through different mechanisms. KT5720 is a widely used selective PKA inhibitor (at nanomolar to low micromolar concentrations) that binds to the catalytic subunits of PKA, causing the displacement of the regulatory subunit and thereby inhibiting the phosphorylating activity of the kinase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>]. cAMPS-Rp is a competitive antagonist of cAMP-induced activation of PKA (selective in the low to mid micromolar range) by interacting with cAMP binding sites on the regulatory subunits to prevent cAMP-induced dissociation and activation of the enzyme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. Both inhibitors had similar effects. Although these compounds are membrane permeable, we showed that direct intracellular injection of KT5720 had the same effect as perfusion of the slice, confirming an intracellular site of action. U0126 is a well established, membrane-permeable and highly selective inhibitor of ERK activation (at nanomolar to low micromolar concentrations) by directly inhibiting the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase family members, MEK-1 and MEK-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. The MEK/ERK-selectivity of U0126 is supported by the fact that the inactive structural analogue U0124 had no effect. PKA and ERK inhibitors had additive effects that were not mimicked by a selective PKC inhibitor (GF109203x (Toullec et al., 1991), further arguing against non-specific effects.</p><p>In this study we used protein kinase inhibitors rather than activators, because we sought to determine the role of endogenously activated kinases. Exogenous activation of PKA with forskolin was used to determine the interaction with ERK. We did not test phorbol esters, which are commonly used to activate ERK, because they do so through PKC activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>], which does not appear to be involved in arthritis pain related plasticity in our studies. Therefore, phorbol esters would not mimic the endogenous situation but possibly confound the analysis of ERK function.</p><p>Another issue concerns the use of microdialysis for drug application in the behavioral studies. Microdialysis offers several advantages, including continued drug delivery and steady state levels without a volume effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">76</xref>]. However, the dose delivered by microdialysis is not known. Based on our previous microdialysis studies of similar-sized non-peptide compounds, we used drug concentrations in the microdialysis fiber that were 100 times higher than the target concentration in the tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>] because of the concentration gradient across the dialysis membrane and diffusion in the tissue[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. A "dilution" factor of 100 is further supported by the qualitatively and quantitatively similar effects of drug concentrations applied to the brain slices in the electrophysiological studies and those administered by microdialysis in the behavioral studies.</p><p>Finally, it may be surprising that the kinetics of the NMDA component and the compound EPSC were largely similar, whereas data in the literature suggest that NMDA receptors mediate slow EPSCs of relatively long duration [for recent review see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B77">77</xref>]]. In addition, NMDA receptor-mediated EPSCs could be recorded at a holding potential of -60 mV, where NMDA receptor channels are normally blocked by magnesium. The NMDA component was isolated pharmacologically with NBQX and bicuculline and was only present in slices from arthritic animals, which is consistent with our previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] that showed similar characteristics of NMDA receptor-mediated synaptic transmission in the amygdala in the arthritis pain model. The results can be explained by the effects of receptor phosphorylation. NMDA receptor phosphorylation relieves the magnesium block and renders the channel functional even at -60 mV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">72</xref>]. NMDA receptor phosphorylation by PKA or PKC also accelerates the rise and decay times of the ion channel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B78">78</xref>], which explains the absence of apparent differences in the kinetics of NMDA EPSC and compound EPSC in the present study. However, our finding that an NMDA receptor-mediated component was difficult to detect under normal conditions even at depolarized membrane potentials (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>) may suggest that PKA modulates NMDA receptor function through additional mechanisms such as synaptic targeting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B78">78</xref>].</p><p>In conclusion, the present study shows that PKA and ERK, but not PKC, are important for pain-related plasticity in the amygdala and for the behavioral consequences of this activity change. PKA and ERK target the NMDA receptor possibly through independent signaling cascades. PKA and ERK render normally "silent" NMDA receptors functional in the arthritis pain model. The independence of PKA and ERK signaling and the lack of PKC effects in this study are different from spinal central sensitization and hippocampal LTP and suggest that the role of protein kinases may be more specific than previously thought.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>YF and JH performed patch-clamp recordings, analyzed electrophysiology data, and provided figures and manuscript drafts.
