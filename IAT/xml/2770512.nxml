AD progressively leads to a severely impaired state and complete social dependence. At autopsy, cerebral atrophy, neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid plaques are observed in the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, amygdala and other areas. Tangles consist of intraneuronal masses of helically wound filaments of the hyperphosphorylated protein, tau. Plaques are extracellular deposits of A&#x003b2;, a peptide derived from cleavage of APP, surrounded by dystrophic neurites. Most AD cases present A&#x003b2; deposits in cortical and/or meningeal micro vessels. In a minority of cases, this vascular cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is rather severe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>APP is a type I transmembrane protein that undergoes a series of proteolytic cleavages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. &#x003b2;-secretase cleaves APP into a soluble ectodomain (sAPP&#x003b2;) and a membrane bound C-terminal fragment of 99 amino acids (C99). C99 is cleaved by the &#x003b3;-secretase, which consists of a multicomponent complex comprised of Presenilins (PS1 and PS2), Nicastrin (NCT), PEN2 and APH1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The &#x003b3;-cleavage releases two peptides: A&#x003b2; peptide, consisting of 2 major species of 40 and 42 amino acids (A&#x003b2;40 and A&#x003b2;42, respectively) and an intracellular product AID/AICD, Several evidence point to the short AID/AICD as a biologically active intracellular peptide, which may modulate cell death, Notch signaling, gene transcription and Ca<sup>++ </sup>homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. In an alternative pathway, APP is processed by &#x003b1;-secretase within the A&#x003b2; sequence, leading to the production of the soluble sAPP&#x003b1; ectodomain and a membrane bound C-terminal fragment of 83 amino acids (C83). After age, a family history of dementia is major risk factor for AD and 10%-15%, of all AD subjects have a family history consistent with an autosomal dominant trait. These familial cases (FAD) are due to mutations in APP and in Presenilins because they alter the rate of APP processing and A&#x003b2;42 generation.</p><p>Given the role of APP processing by secretases to AD pathology and APP-mediated functions, identifying the molecules that regulate APP cleavage is physiologically relevant and of therapeutic interest. A genetic screen aimed to the identification of regulators of APP processing led to the identification of BRI2 and BRI3 as APP ligands that inhibit A&#x003b2; formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. In the same screening, we found CD74 as an APP-interacting protein as well.</p><p>Human CD74 is a type II transmembrane protein of 216 amino acids which functions as a molecular chaperone of class II major histocompatibility complex (MIIC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], and at the same time as a receptor for macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] or together with CD44 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. However, little is known about the relationship between CD74 and APP. Because both BRI2 and BRI3 interact with APP and inhibits APP processing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], we investigated the role of CD74 in regulating the processing of APP. Here, we show that CD74 interacts with APP, inhibits A&#x003b2; production, and accumulates APP to endocytotic vacuoles produced by CD74.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Split-ubiquitin screening</title><p>The construction of APP as bait, and screening method was described elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Cell culture, transfection, plasmids, antibodies and Western blotting</title><p>Cell lines, transfection methods, mammalian expression constructs of APP, APP-Ncas, APP Swedish, APP London, APP-YFP, myc-tagged Notch, APLP2 were described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].

The gels were transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (Whatman BA85 Protran) with NuPAGE transfer buffer (Invitrogen NP0006) in a Trans-Blot cell (Bio-Rad). After the transfer, the membrane was blocked in PBS containing 5% skim milk, and incubated with indicated primary antibodies over night in the same buffer. The membrane was washed in PBS containing 0.05% Tween-20, and incubated in corresponding secondary antibodies for 1 hour.

To precipitate the immune complex, the cleared lysates were mixed with FLAG beads, or with indicated antibodies and protein A beads (Pierce). A rabbit polyclonal antibody was used as a negative control of &#x003b1;APPct precipitation.

This screening is designed so that the each bait and prey are fused to each half of modified ubiquitin, which upon interaction releases the DNA binding domain and activation domain. They are translocated to the nuclei and transcriptionally activate the downstream reporter gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. This screening enabled us to clone transmembrane proteins, which are very difficult to clone in regular yeast two hybrid screening because the transmembrane proteins do not translocate to the nucleus to activate the downstream signal.</p><p>One of the clones isolated contained the entire CD74 cDNA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). CD74 serves as an invariant chain of Class II major histocompatibility complex (MIIC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], and it also serves as a receptor for macrophage migration inhibitory factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. CD74 is a type II transmembrane protein, which is processed by protease during its maturation as a chaperon of Class II MHC molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>A) A cartoon of various FLAG-tagged CD74 constructs: the yeast split-ubiquitin (TH) clone, full length CD74, two deletions constructs of CD74, and two splicing variants of mouse CD74</bold>. The cytoplasmic and luminal parts, the locations of the FLAG tag, the endosomal-sorting signal in the cytoplasmic domain (LL), the CLIP domain (C), and the trimeric domain (T) are indicated. B) HeLa cells were transfected with pcDNA3 (-) or FLAG-CD74 (+) together with APP, and the total cell lysates (TL) and FLAG immunoprecipitants (IP) were analyzed by Westerm blot. Full length APP, APP CTF (C99 and C83), and CD74 were detected with 22C11, &#x003b1;APPct, and &#x003b1;FLAG antibodies, respectively. The 33 and 14 kDa N-terminal fragments of CD74 were designated as CD74 NTF33 and NTF14. C) HeLa cells were transfected with FLAG-CD74 and APP, and the total lysates of the transfected cells were immunoprecipitated with either rabbit polyclonal antibody (RP) or &#x003b1;APPct, and analyzed as in B. D) HeLa cells were transfected with various CD74 constructs and APP. The total lysates and FLAG IPs were analyzed as in B. Mature APP and immature APP (mAPP/imAPP) are indicated. The bands marked with asterisks (*) were attributed to the FLAG antibody used in the immunoprecipitation.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1750-1326-4-41-1"/></fig><p>In the same split-ubiquitin yeast screening using APP as bait, we cloned BRI2 and BRI3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Since BRI2 and BRI3 are also single pass, type II transmembrane proteins themselves, and interact with APP and inhibit the production of A&#x003b2; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] we decided to test if the same is true for CD74 in mammalian cell context.</p><p>Full length CD74 with an N-terminal FLAG tag were transfected to HeLa cells. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, the immunoprecipitation of CD74 from the total lysates indicated that predominantly mature APP (mAPP) interacted with CD74. There is little binding to the two APP C-terminal fragments (APP CTFs, indicated as C99 and C83). No consistent change was observed for the amount of APP CTFs. This CD74-APP interaction was further confirmed by the reciprocal immunoprecipitation. The total lysates were prepared from the HeLa cells cotransfected with FLAG-CD74 and APP, and the CD74 fragments bound to the precipitated APP were analyzed. The Westerm blot shows that CD74 indeed bound to APP. Interestingly, the 33 kDa fragment (CD74 NTF33), but not the 14 kDa fragment (CD74 NTF14) of CD74 was associated with APP, even though NTF14 was clearly the major CD74 NTF in the total lysates (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). The preferred binding of NTF33 over NTF14 indicates that NTF 14 is not sufficient for the CD74-APP interaction, and hints that the trimeric region of CD74 is required for the interaction.</p><p>Next, we attempted to determine the region of CD74 required for this interaction. cDNA obtained in the two-hybrid screening, full length CD74, two fragments of CD74, and the two mouse CD74 isoforms (p31 and p41) were cloned into a FLAG-tagged mammalian expression vector (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>), and cotransfected into HeLa cells together with APP. Immunoprecipitation with FLAG beads showed that both human and mouse CD74 bound mature APP. The lack of interaction found in the deletion construct CD74 (1-115) confirms that the luminal portion containing the trimeric domain is required for the CD74 binding to APP. The deletion of first 23 amino acids (CD74 24-216) also disrupted the interaction, hinting to the possibility that the endosomal-targeting signal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] might be involved in this interaction.</p></sec><sec><title>CD74 does not interact with Notch or APLP2</title><p>To investigate the specificity of CD74-APP binding, myc-tagged Notch and APLP2 were transfected into HeLa cells together with pcDNA3 or FLAG-CD74. They lysates from the transfected cells were precipitated with FLAG beads to analyze if Notch or APLP2 co purified with CD74. As indicated in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, CD74 did not precipitate Notch. Nor did it precipitate APLP2, a close homolog of APP (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). The lack of interaction with Notch or APLP2 further attests the specificity of the CD74-APP interaction.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>A) HeLa cells were transfected with pcDNA3 (-) or CD74 (+), together with Notch</bold>.

These are all APP mutations that in humans cause familial forms of Alzheimer's disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], except for APP-Ncas that is an APP construct missing the COOH-terminal 31 amino acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. The lysates were prepared from the transfected cells, and CD74 was precipitated. The FLAG immunoprecipitations show that CD74 fully interacts with mature form of all APP variants (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2G</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>CD74 changes the intracellular distribution of APP</title><p>Next, we sought to identify how CD74 and APP are distributed inside the cell. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref> for Hela cells transfected with APP-YFP or FLAG-CD74, APP is localized in intracellular reticular structures, while CD74 is targeted to endosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Overexpression of CD74 and has been reported to create vacuoles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] that we also can appreciate (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>A) HeLa cells were transfected with APP-YFP or FLAG-CD74</bold>.

CC and ICQ are as in B.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1750-1326-4-41-3"/></fig><p>When these two were co expressed in the same cell, a significant portion of APP co localized with CD74 in these vacuoles (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>, upper panels). This CD74-dependent redistribution of APP is specific since, for example, CD74 did not co-localize in these vacuolar structures with Notch-GFP, reinforcing the above mentioned biochemical observation that CD74 does not bind Notch (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>).</p><p>Next, we tested if the major APP CTF fragments, C99 and C83, changed intracellular localization if expressed together with CD74. For this, HeLa cells were cotransfected with these APP variants and FLAG-CD74, and stained with &#x003b1;APPct to visualize APP, C99 and C83, and &#x003b1;FLAG to visualize CD74. As expected, APP co localized with CD74 nicely in the vacuolar structures. However, C99 and C83 did not show detectable accumulation to the CD74 induced vacuolar structures. This observation could explain the initial immunoprecipitations results that CD74 barely interact with APP CTFs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>We isolated CD74, together with the familial dementia gene BRI2 and its family member BRI3, during a genetic screening for membrane-bound APP ligands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. CD74 is known to work as a chaperon of class II major histocompatibility complex in B cells, which present antigens to T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Interestingly, the functions of CD74 are not limited to the chaperons in the immune cells. Recently, CD74 has been proposed to serve as a receptor for macrophage migration inhibitory factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>CD74 associates with Class II MHC in endoplasmic reticulum. After it is transported through post-Golgi compartments, the complex are diverted to endocytic vesicles, and CD74 is proteolytically processed to CLIP region (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>), which remains bound to Class II MHC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. APP does not associate CD74 in endoplasmic reticulum, since only fully glycosylated APP binds to CD74 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>), and CD74 does not change the rate of maturation of APP (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2F</xref>). Thus it is unlikely that CD74 functions as ER chaperones as in the case of Class II MHC.</p><p>We previously showed that the familial dementia gene BRI2 and its homologue BRI3 are inhibitors of APP processing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Here, we have established that CD74 binds APP and inhibits the production of A&#x003b2;. Like the two members of the <italic>BRI </italic>gene family, CD74 is also a type II transmembrane protein, but structurally unrelated to BRIs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). CD74 can immunoprecipitate APP (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Reciprocal immunoprecipitations shows APP can precipitate CD74 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). Both N-terminal 23 amino acids and C-terminal 101 amino acids of CD74 are required for the interaction (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). On the APP side, C99 and C83 scarcely bind CD74 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>).</p><p>This binding of CD74 to APP is similar to that of BRI2 or BRI3, in that only the mature form of APP binds CD74 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). However, there is a clear difference: CD74 does not cause the accumulation of C99 as in the case of BRI2, nor does it bind to C99 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Or, contrary to BRI2 and BRI3, CD74 does not inhibit secretion of sAPP&#x003b1; or sAPP&#x003b2; (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Therefore, it is unlikely that CD74 is working on APP by masking the secretase sites as in the case of BRI2 and BRI3. Rather, CD74 might be redirecting APP to intracellular compartments where the production of A&#x003b2; in reduced.</p><p>As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D-F</xref>, CD74 does reduce the A&#x003b2; in the media when APP is co transfected, but it does not change the cytoplasmic A&#x003b2;40 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>), or the stability of exogenously added A&#x003b2; (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref>), or the maturation of APP (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2F</xref>). These data further support our notion that CD74 works on APP inside cells after APP is matured, and not by destabilizing A&#x003b2; already secreted in the media.</p><p>It is noteworthy that the major metabolite of CD74 (CD74NTF14) does not interact with APP, but the minor fragment (NTF33) does (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). This observation strongly argues that the CD74-APP interaction is specific because APP distinguishes NTF33 from NTF14; and the interaction occurs before CD74 is irreversibly processed further than NTF33; and at least NTF33 is required for the interaction. We cannot conclude that NTF33 is the minimal region required for the CD74-APP interaction because NTF33 might interact with APP indirectly, in a trimer with full length CD74. The precise dissection of the minimal region responsible for the binding requires further study, and should take into account the fact that CD74 forms trimers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].</p><p>APP and CD74 displays distinct intracellular distribution. When transfected independently, APP displays reticular and vesicular structures in the cytoplasm. In contrast, CD74 shows larger vacuoles, which are endosomal in nature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Our observation that APP co localizes with CD74 in vacuolar structure in HeLa cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>, upper panels) supports the notion that CD74 and APP interact. Moreover, the striking APP re-distribution to CD74-positive vacuolar structures suggests that this change is caused by the physical interaction of CD74 and APP. Co expression of CD74 and either Notch, C99 or C83 (all molecules that do not bind CD74) show the specificity of this phenomenon since Notch, C99 and C83 do not accumulate in CD74-positive vacuoles upon co expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>, lower panels, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>).</p><p>Thus we propose that unlike BRI2 or BRI3, which are working directly on APP by blocking the access of secretases to APP, CD74 interferes with APP processing by regulating the sub-cellular localization of APP in compartments where amyloidogenic APP cleavage is reduced.</p><p>Little is known about the relationship between CD74 and AD. In immuno-histochemistry experiments, normal brains do not stain well for CD74 and CD74 is mostly expressed in microglia. However, the brains of AD patients have increased CD74 staining [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Interestingly, a recent study shows that CD74 is accumulated in neurons with paired helical fibers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Our findings suggest that CD74 may be a player in controlling APP biology and processing, perhaps regulating APP trafficking in neurons. Given the anti-amyloidogenic activity of CD74, it is possible that the increased levels of CD74 in AD brains, potentially caused by increased TNF&#x003b1; in AD patients and in transgenic mouse over expressing APP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>], could contribute to a negative feedback mechanism of the organism to fend off noxious APP processing up regulation.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>SM conceived of the study, carried out yeast and biochemical studies and drafted the manuscript.
