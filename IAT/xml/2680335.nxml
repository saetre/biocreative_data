There, they initiate the activation and expansion of lymphocytes specific for their cognate Ag. In mammals, the structural environment of secondary lymphoid tissues (SLTs) is considered essential for the initiation of adaptive immunity. Nevertheless, cold-blooded vertebrates can initiate potent systemic immune responses even though they lack conventional SLTs. The emergence of lymph nodes provided mammals with drastically improved affinity maturation of B cells. Here, we combine the use of different strains of alymphoplastic mice and T cell migration mutants with an experimental paradigm in which the site of Ag delivery is distant from the site of priming and inflammation. We demonstrate that in mammals, SLTs serve primarily B cell priming and affinity maturation, whereas the induction of T cell-driven immune responses can occur outside of SLTs. We found that mice lacking conventional SLTs generate productive systemic CD4- as well as CD8-mediated responses, even under conditions in which draining LNs are considered compulsory for the initiation of adaptive immunity. We describe an alternative pathway for the induction of cell-mediated immunity (CMI), in which Ag-presenting cells sample Ag and migrate into the liver where they induce neo-lymphoid aggregates. These structures are insufficient to support antibody affinity maturation and class switching, but provide a novel surrogate environment for the initiation of CMI.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Lymph nodes (LNs) are believed to be the most important tissues initiating immune responses by facilitating the activation of T and B lymphocytes. Mice lacking such LNs (called alymphoplastic) are severely immune compromised and resistant to immunizations. We discovered that the immune-deficiency of such alymphoplastic mice is actually not caused by the loss of LNs, but rather by the underlying genetic lesion. Surprisingly, mice lacking all lymph nodes can still mount potent T cell-mediated immune responses. We also discovered that T and B cells have completely different structural requirements for their activation/maturation. Whereas B cells rely on LNs to become efficient antibody-producing cells, T cells can be activated successfully outside of such dedicated tissues. So&#x02014;in the absence of LNs&#x02014;antigens delivered by immunization are actively transported into the liver where cellular immunity is initiated. The mammalian fetal liver is responsible for the early formation of blood and immune cells, and we propose that the adult liver can still provide a niche for T cell&#x02013;antigen encounters. During evolution, T and B cells emerged simultaneously, allowing cold-blooded vertebrates (which lack LNs) to launch adaptive immune responses. The development of LNs in mammals coincided with a drastic improvement in antibody affinity maturation, whereas T cells remain LN-independent to this day.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Secondary lymphoid tissues (SLTs) are highly organized structures with defined compartments consisting of B and T cell areas. These distinct locations support the rapid circulation and concentration of Ag and the interaction of Ag-presenting cells (APCs) with lymphocytes. Prevailing dogma dictates that only if competent APCs transport Ag into SLTs, an adaptive immune response is initiated; otherwise, the Ag is ignored by the immune system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000109-Zinkernagel1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. For the initiation of humoral antibody (Ab)-mediated immunity in mammals, the formation of B cell follicles and germinal centers (GCs) appears to be a prerequisite. The dynamic nature of such GCs, including the interaction of follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) with B cells and Ag, was recently elegantly demonstrated by others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000109-Schwickert1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. However, in contrast to the B cell-dominated cortex, T cell areas, where T cells encounter mature APCs and their cognate Ag, are structurally ill defined. Whereas intravital confocal microscopy has provided compelling evidence for the capacity of SLTs to host T cell priming <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000109-Beltman1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, definitive data supporting their absolute requirement for the initiation of T cell-mediated immunity (CMI) do not exist. In addition, cold-blooded vertebrates lacking conventional SLTs generate potent immune responses upon immunization. However, in the mammalian system, the apparent immunodeficiency of mice that lack SLTs strongly supports the notion that the initiation of effective immune responses requires the dedicated structures provided by SLTs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000109-Ochsenbein1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000109-Matsumoto1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. <italic>Alymphoplasia</italic> (<italic>aly/aly</italic>) mice are characterized by a complete lack of lymph nodes (LNs) and Peyer's patches, and structural alterations of the spleen and thymus due to a point mutation in the NF&#x003ba;B-inducing kinase (NIK) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000109-Shinkura1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>.

Using different strains of alymphoplastic mice and T cell migration mutants in an experimental paradigm in which the site of Ag-delivery is distant from the site of priming and again distant from the site of inflammation, we can detect both T<sub>H</sub> cell-driven autoimmune disease as well as systemic CTL-mediated antitumor immunity initiated through classical subcutaneous (s.c.) immunization/vaccination independent of SLTs. APCs present at the site of immunization migrate to and select the liver as a natural extra-lymphoid tissue for the initiation of CMI, which we propose to be an evolutionary hard-wired pathway already found in cold-blooded vertebrates. This alternative pathway, undescribed to this day, can potently drive CMI but fails to elicit B cell immunity, indicating that the immunization-induced T cell accumulation within conventional lymphoid organs mainly serves humoral immunity but that CMI can be initiated elsewhere.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Autoimmunity Cannot Be Initiated in <italic>Aly/Aly</italic> Mice</title><p>We first sought to determine whether LNs are an absolute requirement for the induction of a complex T<sub>H</sub> cell-driven autoimmune response initiated by the s.c. delivery of auto-Ag.

Only a small amount of Ag reaches the liver when draining SLTs are present. Next, we wanted to determine the means of the Ag transport from the s.c. reservoir to the liver. To determine whether the Ag diffuses to the liver or is actively transported by APCs, <italic>aly/&#x0002b;</italic>&#x02192;<italic>aly/&#x0002b;</italic> and <italic>aly/&#x0002b;</italic>&#x02192;<italic>aly/aly</italic><sup>spl</sup> chimeric mice were separated into two groups. One received YG microspheres/CFA in the left flank and polychromatic red (PR) microspheres/CFA in the right flank. The other group received a mixture of YG- and PR-coupled beads in both flanks (see scheme in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000109-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). After 7 d, mice were sacrificed, perfused, and a single-cell suspension of livers, LNs, and spleens was generated for cytofluorometric analysis. We found that the mixture of PR/YG-coupled beads generated a large proportion of dual-labeled CD11b as well as CD11c-positive APCs. Conversely, the injection of either PR- or YG-coupled microspheres into each flank revealed merely single-labeled APCs in the liver. The presence of single-labeled cells within the liver strongly suggests that the Ag is delivered to the liver by the migration of APCs initially present at the site of immunization. Passive diffusion of the Ag from the site of immunization via the bloodstream to the liver cannot be fully excluded, but is evidently not the dominant means of Ag delivery. In addition, only a negligible amount of Ag reaches the liver when dedicated SLTs are present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000109-g004">Figure 4</xref>). We could also confirm these findings by using soluble FITC painted on shaved flanks (without the adjuvant CFA).

In the absence of such draining LNs, we found however, that APCs take up the Ag at the site of immunization and subsequently select the liver as an extra-lymphoid environment for the initiation of CMI. These findings are consistent with the propensity of alymphoplastic mice (NIK<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>, LT&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>, and LT&#x003b2;R<italic><sup>&#x02212;/</sup></italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup>) to develop abnormal lymphocytic infiltrates primarily in the liver <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000109-Futterer1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000109-Banks1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. The lymphocyte accumulation seen in the liver of naive alymphoplastic mice does not coincide with any overt tissue damage, nor do they develop any secondary sign of hepatic injury (M. Heikenwaelder, Zurich, Switzerland, personal correspondence). Such surrogate structures are evidently not as sophisticated as true SLTs and fail to support B cell priming, but are clearly sufficient to support CMI. Such neo-lymphoid structures in the liver are not restricted to alymphoplastic mouse strains, but can be reproduced in mice in which T cells do not migrate into the LNs (<italic>plt/plt</italic>). The fact that we observe the rapid emergence of immunization-induced T cell expansion in the liver of normal mice supports the notion that the adult liver provides an efficient niche for the initiation of CMI. Moyron-Quiroz et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000109-MoyronQuiroz2">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref> elegantly demonstrated that the lymphoid tissue in the lung (BALT) is sufficient to generate immunity against an infectious agent attacking the lung. In their experimental paradigm, peripheral SLTs are not compulsory for the initiation of protective immunity, and they could even observe some degree of B cell maturation. In our report, however, after s.c. immunization, the local APCs must sample the Ag and then actively migrate to and select the liver as a site for T cell priming, which then is even capable of driving autoimmune responses within the CNS. In our experimental paradigm, the site of Ag deposition, priming, and inflammation are distinct. The liver is thus not like the BALT or the NALT, a site where local immune responses can be initiated, but represents a niche for systemic T cell priming under conditions in which the draining LNs are widely held to be absolutely compulsory. The fact that Ag-laden APCs migrate from the site of immunization to the periportal areas in the liver could be explained by the presence of chemoattractive factors in the liver aggregates observed in SLT mutants. Alternatively, the extensive lymphatic network of the liver makes it an ideal niche for the accumulation of leukocytes as a reservoir when regular SLTs are inaccessible.</p><p>Although the induction of CMI is not a function traditionally attributed to the adult liver, the fetal liver is a primary lymphoid organ hosting early hematopoiesis. Our findings suggest that the liver has the potential to &#x0201c;remember&#x0201d; its lymphoid function. The phenomenon, that, for instance, food allergies can be transferred by the transplantation of livers from an allergic donor to a previously nonallergic recipient <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000109-Legendre1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, can be explained by our findings. Such transplant-acquired food allergy has only been described for the liver and not for other transplanted organs of the same donor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000109-Legendre1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. It has been hypothesized that this occurrence is due to donor-derived allergen-specific lymphocytes residing in the liver. In support of this, Klein and Crispe <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000109-Klein1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref> reported recently that after liver transplantation in a mouse in which Ag presentation was restricted to resident cells of the liver grafts, efficient CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell priming can be induced locally in the transplanted liver.</p><p>The situation also is reminiscent of the effect of immunizations on some cold-blooded vertebrates that are much more primitive than mammals in their SLT organization (i.e., lacking GCs and showing only minimal affinity maturation). Frog tadpoles (<italic>Alytes obstetricans</italic>) immunized with rabbit serum in CFA developed a large accumulation of lymphocytes in the liver visible 2&#x02013;3 wk after injection (L. Dupasquier, Basel, Switzerland, personal correspondence). Interestingly, during evolution, the emergence of RAG was permissive for the development of adaptive immunity in jawed fish <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000109-Flajnik1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. RAG mediates somatic recombination and is required for the formation of both B and T cell receptors, which appear to have emerged simultaneously during evolution. However, whereas the adaptive immune system is well developed in the oldest jawed vertebrates (cartilaginous fish, e.g., sharks), potent affinity maturation, Ig-class switching, and GC formation are lacking. Class switching only appeared at the time of the divergence of amphibians <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000109-Stavnezer1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. The fact that CMI evolved earlier than modern humoral immune responses corroborates our discovery that T cells can function outside of dedicated lymphoreticular structures.</p><p>In summary, we demonstrate that the structural requirements for the initiation of B and T cell responses differ significantly. We found that B cells are dependent on the topography of dedicated lymphoid tissues, whereas CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> as well as CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T lymphocytes retain the capacity to recognize Ag in a structure-independent fashion. This finding has obvious implications for our understanding of adaptive immunity and vaccination. As for the development of autoimmune diseases, our findings show that self-reactive T cells may not need to be primed in tissue-draining LNs, but could occur at the inflammatory site or even in organs distant to the target tissue.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Mice</title><p>C57BL/6 mice were purchased from Janvier Laboratories.
