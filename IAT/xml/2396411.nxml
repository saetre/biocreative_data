Genetic and biochemical analyses in yeast are consistent with Pet54p forming a complex with other translational activators that, in an unknown way, associates with the 5&#x02032; untranslated leader (UTL) of COX3 mRNA. Likewise, genetic analysis suggests that Pet54p along with another distinct set of proteins facilitate splicing of the aI5&#x003b2; intron, but the function of Pet54 is, also, obscure. In particular, it remains unknown whether Pet54p is a primary RNA-binding protein that specifically recognizes the 5&#x02032; UTL and intron RNAs or whether its functional specificity is governed in other ways. Using recombinant protein, we show that Pet54p binds with high specificity and affinity to the aI5&#x003b2; intron and facilitates exon ligation <italic>in vitro</italic>. In addition, Pet54p binds with similar affinity to the COX3 5&#x02032; UTL RNA. Competition experiments show that the COX3 5&#x02032;UTL and aI5&#x003b2; intron RNAs bind to the same or overlapping surface on Pet54p. Delineation of the Pet54p-binding sites by RNA deletions and RNase footprinting show that Pet54p binds across a similar length sequence in both RNAs. Alignment of the sequences shows significant (56%) similarity and overlap between the binding sites. Given that its role in splicing is likely an acquired function, these data support a model in which Pet54p's splicing function may have resulted from a fortuitous association with the aI5&#x003b2; intron. This association may have lead to the selection of Pet54p variants that increased the efficiency of aI5&#x003b2; splicing and provided a possible means to coregulate COX1 and COX3 expression.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Group I introns are mobile genetic elements that have colonized diverse sets of organisms including bacteria, bacteriophage and unicellular eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). As one example, the mitochondria (mt) of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> contain up to nine group I introns that are found within the cytochrome oxidase (COX) 1, apocytochrome b (COB) and large ribosomal RNA genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). While some group I introns can self-splice <italic>in vitro</italic>, most are believed to require proteins for splicing <italic>in vivo</italic>. In fact, genetic analysis in fungi has shown that a number of nuclear encoded mt proteins are required for group I intron splicing. In most cases, individual proteins show high substrate specificity and facilitate splicing of only one intron. Interestingly, in a few specific cases, these proteins have additional mt functions, such as aminoacylation or translational activation, and splicing function likely reflects the secondary adaptation of each protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Thus, investigations of such group I intron cofactors provides a rich opportunity to understand details of molecular evolution that may be pertinent in the selection of other multifunctional (&#x02018;moonlighting&#x02019;) proteins in more complex organisms, such as pre-mRNA splicing cofactors which are secondarily involved in mRNA export and translational regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>).</p><p>The Pet54p protein is an intriguing example of a nuclear encoded moonlighting protein in yeast mt. Disruption of the <italic>PET54</italic> gene affects both the processing of the aI5&#x003b2; group I intron in the COX1 pre-mRNA and the translation of the COX3 mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Despite extensive investigations, the mechanisms of Pet54p function in these two unrelated processes remains elusive. In particular, it is unknown whether Pet54p is a primary RNA-binding protein that specifically recognizes both RNAs or whether its functional specificity is governed in other ways.</p><p>Pet54p is a small, &#x0223c;35-kDa protein that contains an RNA recognition motif (RRM) near its C-terminus. Genetic and biochemical analyses have established that Pet54p interacts with two other factors, Pet122 and Pet494, and this complex functionally interacts with the 5&#x02032; untranslated leader (UTL) of COX3 mRNA. The multipart complex is essential for COX3 translation, since disruption of any component severely reduces COX3 protein production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). How the complex assembles on the 5&#x02032; UTL and promotes translation is not known, but, once bound, it may serve to facilitate ribosome recognition of the AUG start codon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9 B10 B11">9&#x02013;11</xref>). The presence of an RRM in Pet54p is suggestive that the protein binds to the 5&#x02032; UTL of COX3, but no direct evidence exists to show this is the case. However, deletions within the COX3 5&#x02032; UTL exacerbate the respiratory-deficient (mt-impaired) phenotype of a mis-sense mutation just downstream of the RRM motif in Pet54p. These observations are thought to reflect a functional interaction between Pet54p and RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>).</p><p>The role of Pet54p in promoting aI5&#x003b2; splicing is even less clear. Like all group I introns, the aI5&#x003b2; intron must fold into an active conformation to catalyze the self-splicing reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Genetic analyses have shown that aI5&#x003b2; splicing efficiency is reduced when one of five mt targeted nuclear genes, including PET54, is disrupted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). An attractive hypothesis is that Pet54p along with the other proteins function to facilitate folding of the intron. Protein involvement in group I intron folding has been demonstrated <italic>in vitro</italic> for the <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic> mt tyrosyl tRNA synthetase, <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> mt CBP2 and <italic>Aspergillus nidulans</italic> I-AniI proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14 B15 B16 B17">14&#x02013;17</xref>). The disruption of the PET54 gene does not appear to affect the splicing of any other yeast mt group I intron suggesting that the protein may interact directly with the aI5&#x003b2; intron or one of its other cofactors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>).</p><p>As a starting point to understand how Pet54p functions as both an activator of COX3 translation and as an essential cofactor in the splicing of aI5&#x003b2; intron, we have analyzed its interaction with both RNA ligands using recombinant Pet54p purified from bacteria. UV cross-linking experiments provide evidence that Pet54p specifically recognizes both the COX3 5&#x02032; UTL and the COX1 pre-mRNA containing the aI5&#x003b2; intron. <italic>In vitro</italic> experiments are consistent with Pet54p facilitating the exon ligation step of aI5&#x003b2; splicing. Competition experiments show that both COX3 5&#x02032; UTL and aI5&#x003b2; containing pre-RNA bind to the same or overlapping sites in Pet54p. RNA mapping and mutational experiments demonstrate that Pet54p binds to regions in each RNA that share sequence similarity. Collectively, these observations are consistent with Pet54p using analogous interactions to bind both RNAs and support a model in which a fortuitous association with the aI5&#x003b2; intron provided the opportunity by which Pet54p adapted to function in splicing.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Molecular cloning and mutagenesis</title><p>The aI5&#x003b2; intron containing <italic>COX1</italic> gene was amplified from mt genomic DNA isolated from the BY4741 yeast strain using the primers AI5Top (5&#x02032;-GCGGAATTCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGGATCCACGATATTAATTTAATAAGTGTCG TGC) and AI5Bot (5&#x02032;-GGAAGCTTCACCACGTAGTAAGTCATAAAAAAAAAAG) to make paI5FL.

Aliquots (15 &#x003bc;l) were treated with either buffer, RNase 1 (2.1 U, Ambion) or RNase V1 (0.012 U, Ambion) for 20 s and the reactions stopped by addition of 2 &#x003bc;l of aurin tricarboxylic acid, 1 &#x003bc;l of 0.5 M EDTA and extraction with phenol-CIA. The products were separated in a series of denaturing 6% polyacrylamide/7 M urea gel and the dried gels were visualized and quantified with a phosphorimager. The bands were identified based on comigration with RNase T1 and random hydrolysis markers. Because single nucleotide resolution is more difficult with fragments larger than 150 nt, the assignment of the ends of larger fragments may be 2 or 3 nt displaced. The data were analyzed by subtracting background (based on mock-treated control samples) and band intensities were normalized for each lane with respect to the precursor RNA to account for any loading differences in each lane.

The construct contained a short His6-tag fused to the N-terminus of Pet54 that was used to purify the protein using affinity chromatography (see Materials and Methods section). The 613-nt 5&#x02032; UTL of COX3 along with the upstream tRNA<sup>val</sup> gene and the aI5&#x003b2; intron with flanking exon sequences were amplified by PCR and cloned into a vector downstream of a T7 RNA polymerase promoter for use in generating RNAs via <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription (see Materials and Methods section). The COX3 5&#x02032; UTL is numbered relative to the first base (+1) of the mRNA coding region: 5&#x02032; end of the leader is designated &#x02212;613 and the last base is &#x02212;1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). The 1604-nt aI5&#x003b2; pre-RNA includes a 12-nt 5&#x02032; exon, the catalytic core, an open reading frame encoding a degenerate homing endonuclease and the 3&#x02032; splice site (SS) followed by an 18-nt 3&#x02032; exon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Notably, the aI5&#x003b2; intron contains a noncanonical 162-nt AU-rich insertion sequence that interrupts the normally 3-nt J3/4 sequence between the 5&#x02032; strands of P3 and P4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>).

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A, Pet54p was cross-linked with the aI5&#x003b2; pre-RNA in this assay. Control experiments showed that the crosslink was dependent on 4-thiouridine substitution and UV irradiation (data not shown). Some group I intron cofactors recognize conserved structural features in group I introns and thus binds to multiple introns indiscriminately (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). To test the specificity of the Pet54p interaction, unlabeled group I intron competitor RNAs were included in the cross-linking reactions. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A shows that inclusion of full-length aI5&#x003b2; pre-RNA significantly decreased cross-linking efficiency. In contrast, the presence of the mt COB group I intron RNA from <italic>A. nidulans</italic> did not decrease cross-linking efficiency. Like the aI5&#x003b2; intron, the COB intron transcript is AU rich (65%) and folding studies suggest that almost all of the conserved secondary structure elements are formed in this intron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>).

A plot of the fraction of pre-RNA spliced versus time showed that the first step occurred with a rate of 0.02(&#x000b1;0.005) min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>. However, the fraction of RNA that underwent the second step was only 0.04 (&#x000b1;0.009) after 3 h and may reflect that the 3&#x02032;SS was not properly positioned in the aI5&#x003b2; catalytic core or the intron did not undergo the appropriate conformational changes required for the exon ligation [e.g. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>)]. Addition of Pet54p slightly decreased the overall fraction of RNA that underwent splicing but increased the amplitude of ligated exons to 0.06 (&#x000b1; 0.002), a modest but reproducible increase of 1.5-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B). The rate of ligation was not changed significantly by the addition of Pet54p (0.028 &#x000b1; 0.007 versus 0.022 &#x000b1; 0.006 min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>). Control experiments showed that Pet54p did not facilitate splicing in the absence of Mrs1p (data not shown). Thus, in the minimal aI5&#x003b2; <italic>in vitro</italic> splicing reaction, Pet54p appears to function primarily to increase the efficiency of exon ligation.</p></sec><sec><title>Overlapping binding sites in Pet54p for COX3 5&#x02032; UTL and COX1 aI5&#x003b2; containing RNAs</title><p>We performed UV cross-linking experiments (see above) to assess if Pet54p also directly interacts with the COX3 5&#x02032; UTL. Indeed, as with the aI5&#x003b2; pre-RNA, Pet54p formed an efficient crosslink with 4-thiouridine containing COX3 5&#x02032; UTL RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A). To assess if the Pet54p used a single site for binding to the COX3 5&#x02032;UTL RNA and COX1 aI5&#x003b2; containing RNAs, unlabeled competitor UTL and group I intron RNAs were included in the reaction mixture. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A shows that inclusion of unlabeled COX3 5&#x02032;UTL, full length or truncated (aI5&#x003b2; 3&#x02032;TR) aI5&#x003b2; RNAs abolished cross-linking of 4-thiouridine substituted COX3 5&#x02032;UTL. In contrast, inclusion of the <italic>A. nidulans</italic> COB group I intron had no effect on cross-linking efficiency.

Collectively, these observations provide evidence that Pet54p interacts specifically with both COX3 5&#x02032; UTL and aI5&#x003b2; pre-RNA. In addition, the ability of aI5&#x003b2; RNA to compete for binding to COX3 5&#x02032;UTL and <italic>vice versa</italic> suggest that Pet54p contains a single or overlapping binding sites for each RNA.</p></sec><sec><title>Binding of COX3 5&#x02032; UTL and COX1 aI5&#x003b2; pre-RNA to Pet54p</title><p>To directly measure the binding affinity of Pet54p to its respective ligands and begin to delineate the RNA-binding sites, we carried out equilibrium binding assays on full length and truncated transcripts.

The finding that Pet54p binds with similar affinity to the intron and UTL RNAs raises the possibility that Pet54p recognizes similar binding sites in both RNAs.</p><p>We next split the aI5&#x003b2; 3&#x02032;TR RNA into two fragments to assess whether Pet54p bound within the aI5&#x003b2; group I intron catalytic core or to a region peripheral to the core. In this regard, a 233-nt RNA (P1+INS) was synthesized that contained the 5&#x02032; exon through to the end of the idiosyncratic sequence that is inserted between the 5&#x02032; strands of P3 and P4 helices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>A). Pet54p bound this RNA bound with near wild-type affinity [<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub><sup>app</sup> = 18.2(&#x000b1; 9) nM] providing evidence that the Pet54p recognizes sequences and/or structures within P1 through the insertion sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A). In contrast, a 306-nt RNA (P3-3E) that contained the catalytic core of the intron (with the insertion sequence deleted), from P3 through the 3&#x02032; exon, was not appreciably bound by Pet54p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A). These findings demonstrate that Pet54p does not bind to the intron catalytic core, but, instead, primarily recognizes the 5&#x02032; region of the aI5&#x003b2; RNA.</p><p>In a parallel analysis, the COX3 5&#x02032;UTL was split into approximately equal-sized fragments containing the 5&#x02032; or 3&#x02032; halves of the RNA.

To more precisely define the smallest 5&#x02032; fragment that can be bound by Pet54p, we employed a &#x02018;boundary assay&#x02019; that has been used to map protein-binding sites in rRNA (e.g. 21). In these experiments, either 5&#x02032; end-labeled phosphorothioate (N&#x003b1;S)-substituted RNAs were treated with iodine that cleaves at each phosphorothioate linkage or unsubstituted RNA was treated with RNase T1 that cleaves after guanosine. In both cases, cleavage generates a number of fragments that are then incubated with protein. RNA fragments capable of binding protein are captured on a nitrocellulose filter, eluted and then separated on a denaturing gel. Comparison of the bound and unselected fragments identifies the shortest RNA capable of binding protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>).</p><p>For 5&#x02032; end-labeled A&#x003b1;S substituted aI5&#x003b2; 3&#x02032;TR RNA, Pet54p strongly bound RNAs that contained intron sequence up to A60, within the noncanonical insertion sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A). Furthermore, Pet54p also bound fragments terminating at A50, but the reduced intensity of these bands relative to the other bound fragments is consistent with the protein having a reduced affinity for these RNAs. Taken together, these results show that virtually the entire intron catalytic core was not required for Pet54p binding and that the minimal 5&#x02032; terminal fragment bound by Pet54p is 62 nt. This includes 5&#x02032; exon (12 nt), the remainder of P1 helix, the 5&#x02032; strand of P3 and some sequences in the insertion sequence (50 nt total) of the aI5&#x003b2; RNA (see the schematics in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>)A. <fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>Mapping the Pet54p binding site on COX3 5&#x02032; UTL and COX1 aI5&#x003b2; containing RNA.

The accessibility of the RNA ligands&#x02019; phosphate backbones in the presence and absence of Pet54p was probed by partial ribonuclease digestion.

Interestingly, positions &#x02212;g3 to U3 are also cleaved with V1 consistent with these positions being base paired in the P1 helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A). The cleavage by both V1 and 1 RNases suggests that the paired and unpaired states of this helix are in dynamic equilibrium. The lack of protection from RNase V1 cleavage by protein binding may reflect that Pet54p-binding results in stabilization of the P1 helix while protection of positions in the P1 loop (A4&#x02013;A9) may reflect direct binding by the protein. Interestingly, in the insertion sequence, the two regions protected from RNase 1 cleavage are both surrounded by regions cleaved by V1 suggesting that they are in loops or bulges within adjacent helices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A).</p><p>Importantly, the protected regions lie within and adjacent to the sequences found to be critical for Pet54p binding in the boundary assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A).

Poor V1 cleavage efficiency in this region of the RNA makes it difficult to judge the amount of secondary structure, however, given that RNase 1 cleaves only at selective positions suggests that the UTL contains significant secondary and/or tertiary structure. Presumably, the protected regions are close in the folded structure of the UTL.</p><p>The lengths of RNA containing the binding sites for aI5&#x003b2; (not including the P1 paired nts &#x02212;3&#x02013;3) and COX3 5&#x02032; UTL identified by RNase footprinting are of similar size (66 versus 78 nt, respectively) and the sequences are extremely AU rich (89% and 96%, respectively) suggesting that Pet54p may recognize related sequences in both RNAs. Indeed, alignment of these sequences show 56% identity (40/71), with the 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; boundaries of the protected fragments overlapping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>C). Although the 5&#x02032; most protected residues are not precisely aligned, both contain an AAUA sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>C).

Interestingly, the protected sequence from C22 to A27 in aI5&#x003b2; RNA shares significant identity (67%) with the aligned COX UTL sequence. However, the lack of RNase 1 digestion in this region of the UTL prevents making strong conclusions about whether Pet54p binds to this region of the COX3 5&#x02032; UTL. Thus, while RNase footprinting analysis is restricted by a limited number of regions that show cleavage, these observations are consistent with Pet54p recognizing related sequences and/or structures within similar spatial constraints in both of its RNA ligands. These observations are reminiscent of the <italic>E. coli</italic> S7 and S15 ribosomal proteins that interact with different subdomains of 16S rRNA as well as their own mRNAs.

Synthetic lethal and genetic suppression studies were consistent with a model in which Pet54p and Pet122p functionally interacts with the 5&#x02032; UTL of COX3, and mutational analysis has shown that an internal deletion between U &#x02212;605 to A &#x02212;406 of the 5&#x02032; UTL abolishes translational activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). Here we have shown that Pet54p physically interacts with the 5&#x02032; UTL of COX3, and furthermore, it specifically recognizes a 137-nt fragment (residues A &#x02212;613 to G -476) that overlaps with the 199-nt region identified genetically to be important for COX3 translation. Furthermore, mutational analysis has also shown that deletion of COX3 5&#x02032;UTL sequence from G &#x02212;607 to G &#x02212;527 severely diminish COX3 mRNA levels and protein production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). The AU-rich segment (A &#x02212;590 to U &#x02212;512) that contains Pet54p-binding sites, as determined by RNase footprinting, overlaps this region. These results are consistent with Pet54p binding to the upstream region of the 5&#x02032; UTL and playing an important role in helping to assemble the activation complex onto an appropriate location within the COX3 mRNA to facilitate translation (8; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). <fig id="F7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p>Model for Pet54p function in translational activation (<bold>A</bold>) and splicing (<bold>B</bold>). A common RNA-binding domain is used to interact with both RNAs, whereas different effector domains are required for each function. (A) The model for COX3 translational activation is adapted from references 8 and 31. The stem&#x02013;loop shown is to emphasize that the UTL is likely structured but direct evidence for Pet54p binding to a stem&#x02013;loop in the UTL is speculative (see Results section). (B) For the aI5&#x003b2; pre-RNA, the P1 and P10 interactions that position the exons (thick lines) into the catalytic core (thin lines with arrows) are emphasized. Interactions with the 3&#x02032; exon are shown to emphasize one possible model for Pet54p splicing function.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkn045f7"/></fig></p></sec><sec><title>Splicing of the aI5&#x003b2; intron</title><p>Genetic analysis has shown that the protein products of MRS1, PET54, MSS18, MSS116 and SUV3 affect splicing of the aI5&#x003b2; intron, but whether all of these proteins act directly to facilitate splicing and what roles they play are unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). We have shown that Mrs1p binding is sufficient to facilitate aI5&#x003b2; splicing <italic>in vitro</italic>, but the exon ligation step is inefficient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B; A.L. Bifano and M.G. Caprara, in preparation). Here we show that Pet54p binds with high specificity to the aI5&#x003b2; pre-RNA, and it associates primarily with the very 5&#x02032; end of the intron. Binding of Pet54p does not facilitate general catalytic activity of the aI5&#x003b2; intron <italic>in vitro</italic>, but, instead, increases the efficiency of the exon ligation step. The increase in the fraction of molecules that undergo the second step is a modest &#x0223c;1.5-fold suggesting that other factors may collaborate with Pet54p to assist in this step. While the mechanism of action is still under investigation, the finding that Pet54p binds to the 5&#x02032; end of aI5&#x003b2; raises the possibility that it may assist in stabilizing the interaction of the 3&#x02032; exon with the intron's internal guide sequence (P10 pairing) that serves to position the 3&#x02032; SS for ligation after the first step in splicing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>; 12). On the other hand, results from the RNase mapping experiments suggests that binding of Pet54p also stabilizes pairing of the 5&#x02032; exon to the internal guide sequence (P1 pairing). Thus, Pet54p may assist in splicing by preventing premature dissociation of the 5&#x02032; exon after the first step in splicing.</p><p>Previously it was shown by northern analysis that aI5&#x003b2; containing COX1 pre-mRNAs accumulated in PET54 disruption strains suggesting that the protein also is important in the first splicing step (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Presumably our <italic>in vitro</italic> conditions mask this contribution of Pet54p in splicing. However, given that Pet54p binding appears to stabilize the P1 pairing, it may act by promoting docking of the 5&#x02032; exon into the intron's catalytic core. Regardless of the specific mechanism, the observation that Pet54p interacts near (or at) the SSs makes it unique among characterized group I intron cofactors, which primarily bind to and stabilize the active structure of the intron core (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14 B15 B16 B17">14&#x02013;17</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Evolutionary implications</title><p>Our findings show that Pet54p uses the same or overlapping binding sites to interact with the COX3 5&#x02032; UTL and the aI5&#x003b2; intron and a part of the recognition involves related features that span &#x0223c;60 nt in both RNAs. Given that splicing is likely a secondary adaptation of the protein (see Introduction section), these observations support a model in which Pet54p became involved in aI5&#x003b2; processing by virtue of a fortuitous interaction with sequences and/or structures in the intron that resembled its native recognition site in COX3 5&#x02032; UTL. A specific function for Pet54p may have been selected over time if changes in the protein increased the efficiency of splicing. It would be essential that these changes did not impair Pet54p translational activation function; thus, in this model, &#x02018;effector domains&#x02019; of Pet54p are predicted to be separate. In support of this hypothesis, mutations that affect one or the other function have been discovered providing evidence that both functions of Pet54p are genetically separable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). Together with our data, this latter observation suggests that the splicing function of Pet54p may include both RNA binding and effector domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p>Group I intron cofactors either use pre-existing nucleic acid-binding sites to facilitate splicing or &#x02018;develop&#x02019; new binding sites from nonfunctional surfaces. For example, a conserved RNA-binding domain in the yeast mt leucyl-tRNA synthetase is critical for its role in aminoacylation, as well as promoting splicing of bI4 intron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). In contrast, the homing endonuclease I-AniI from <italic>Aspergillus</italic> and the mt tyrosyl tRNA synthetase from <italic>Neurospora</italic> both have developed independent group I intron RNA-binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29 B30 B31">29&#x02013;31</xref>). The Pet54p protein appears to have traveled a unique evolutionary path. On the one hand, it uses a pre-existing RNA-binding site for binding to the aI5&#x003b2; intron, but another, yet to be defined surface, is primarily important for splicing and not translational activation. Thus, in other cases, the evolution of coordinated gene expression at the RNA level may similarly involve the development of protein cofactors that use a single recognition mechanism for two or more substrates, with binding regulating different steps in the expression of individual genes.Continuing studies of the structure and functions of Pet54p should provide new insights into how RNA-binding proteins, in general, may be exploited for other functions <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We thank Dr E.
