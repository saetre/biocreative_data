Southern blot analysis of mouse genomic DNA indicates that the Ya subunit is encoded by a multigene family. The chromosomal distribution of Ya genes was determined by analysis of DNA from a panel of mouse-Chinese hamster somatic cell hybrids. All detectable Ya genes were found to be located on chromosome 9. At least some of the Ya-specific DNA sequences are clustered since, by screening a mouse genomic library, two recombinant phages, each containing two different Ya DNA sequences in the same insert, have been isolated. The finding that Ya is encoded by a cluster of different genes raises the question of the specificity of the different Ya DNA sequences.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00330-0026-a" xlink:role="4827"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00330-0027-a" xlink:role="4828"/></fig><fig id="F3"><graphic xlink:href="nar00330-0029-a" xlink:role="4830"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00330-0024.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4825"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00330-0025.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4826"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00330-0026.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4827"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00330-0027.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4828"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00330-0028.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4829"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00330-0029.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4830"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00330-0030.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4831"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00330-0031.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4832"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00330-0032.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4833"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
