Here, we show that loss of function of either P0 or Mrt4 results in a deficit in 60S subunits, which is apparently due to impaired rRNA processing of 27S precursors. Mrt4, which shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm, defines medium pre-60S particles. In contrast, P0 is absent from medium but present in late/cytoplasmic pre-60S complexes. The absence of Mrt4 notably increased the amount of P0 in nuclear Nop7&#x02013;TAP complexes and causes P0 assembly to medium pre-60S particles. Upon P0 depletion, Mrt4 is relocated to the cytoplasm within aberrant 60S subunits. We conclude that Mrt4 controls the position and timing of P0 assembly. In turn, P0 is required for the release of Mrt4 and exchanges with this factor at the cytoplasm. Our results also suggest other P0 assembly alternatives.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>In all organisms, the biogenesis of ribosomes is a fundamental process mediated by <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors. Most of our knowledge concerning ribosome synthesis in eukaryotes derives from studies with <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>), where around 200 protein <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors and 75 small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2 B3 B4">2&#x02013;4</xref>). These factors, whose precise functions are still largely unknown, must assure speed, accuracy and directionality to the ribosome maturation process. Biogenesis of eukaryotic ribosomes involves the transcription, processing and modification of the pre-rRNAs in the nucleolus, the folding and the assembly of the pre-rRNA with the ribosomal proteins (r-proteins) and the export of the resulting pre-ribosomal particles to the cytoplasm, where the last assembly reactions take place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2 B3 B4">2&#x02013;4</xref>). Pre-rRNA processing is a well-defined pathway and involves a complex series of sequential endo- and exo-nucleolytic reactions (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp806/DC1">Figure S1</ext-link>). However, the concomitant process of r-subunit assembly is still poorly understood. Although an outline of this process was described in the 1970s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>), a detailed characterization of the pre-ribosomal complexes emerged only recently due to the development of affinity purification methods and protein identification by mass spectrometry techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7 B8 B9 B10 B11 B12 B13">7&#x02013;13</xref>). These studies have revealed several distinct, successive pre-ribosomal particles. The 90S particles contain the 35S pre-rRNA, many 40S r-subunit proteins and about 40 <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). Endonucleolytic cleavage of 35S pre-rRNA at site A<sub>0</sub>&#x02013;A<sub>2</sub> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp806/DC1">Figure S1</ext-link>) generates the early 43S and 66S pre-ribosomal particles. It appears that most of the factors associated with 90S particles are released after these cleavages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9 B10 B11">9&#x02013;11</xref>). The early 43S particle is rapidly exported to the cytoplasm. Only a few factors and 40S r-proteins are needed to finish the maturation of 40S r-subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). The early nucleolar pre-60S r-particles are the result of the association of &#x0223c;50 <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors and many 60S r-proteins with the 27SA<sub>2</sub> pre-rRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). The study of the RNA and protein composition of different purified pre-60S complexes is consistent with the presence of distinct intermediates that move from the nucleolus to the nucleoplasm and from there to the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). These intermediates are termed, according to their position in the ribosome assembly pathway, early, medium, late and cytoplasmic pre-60S r-particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Apparently, the complexity of the pre-60S r-particles decreases during their maturation and the export-competent particles have completed the pre-rRNA processing reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). As for the pre-40S particles, last assembly reactions occur in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20 B21 B22 B23">20&#x02013;23</xref>). From this, it must be assumed that (i) the <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors undergo cycles of association for function to and dissociation after function from the distinct pre-ribosomal particles and (ii) these particles undergo structural rearrangements during maturation. Insights into the approximate timing of association of some of these factors have been obtained by studying the composition of distinct purified pre-60S complexes from wild-type and mutant strains blocked at early, medium or late steps of ribosome maturation [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>) and references therein]. Evidence for structural rearrangements has also been recently obtained for both pre-40S and pre-60S r-particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to the <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors for ribosome biogenesis and excluding pioneer work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>), no specific studies on the course of the assembly of the r-proteins have been reported. This is due to the fact that r-proteins are common contaminants in purified complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). Two recent reports have systematically approached the role of individual 40S r-proteins in pre-rRNA processing and their association with pre-ribosomal particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). However, equivalent analyses for the 60S r-proteins have not yet been reported. To date, only functional analyses on ribosome maturation have been reported for a few 60S r-proteins, such as Rpl3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>), Rpl5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>), Rpl10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>), Rpl11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>), Rpl25 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>) and Rpl33 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>).</p><p>We are interested in understanding the functions of the eukaryotic r-stalk. The stalk is a highly flexible protuberance of the 60S r-subunit essential for the interaction and function of a number of soluble translation factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). The eukaryotic stalk is composed of several phosphoproteins, named P proteins. In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, the stalk is formed by two heterodimers of the acidic 12 kDa proteins (P1&#x003b1;-P2&#x003b2; and P1&#x003b2;-P2&#x003b1;) attached to the ribosome via the 32 kDa RNA binding protein P0. In contrast to the prokaryotic equivalent structure, the eukaryotic stalk undergoes a cyclic association/disassociation process during translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>), which apparently generates various ribosome subpopulations with different stalk compositions. This ribosome heterogeneity seems to be on the basis of the proposed stalk translational regulatory capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>). In yeast, protein P0, which plays a central role in this structure, has been found associated with various pre-ribosomal complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>). However, the available data do not provide reliable information about its assembly. P0 has three distinct domains; an N-terminal one, which is responsible for binding to the GTPase-associated region (GAR) of 25S rRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>), a central one, which seems to contain at least two separated regions required to bind the P1&#x003b1;-P2&#x003b2; and P1&#x003b2;-P2&#x003b1; dimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>) and a highly conserved C-terminal peptide, which is required for the protein activity in translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>). Mrt4, a non-essential nucleolar protein likely required for 60S r-subunit biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>), is homologous to the N-terminal domain of P0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>). Due to the significant degree of homology, it has been hypothesized that Mrt4 and P0 successively occupy the same rRNA binding site during ribosome synthesis, and indeed our results show that both proteins are mutually exclusive in r-particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>). In this work, we have studied the effect of depletion of P0 and deletion of <italic>MRT4</italic> on ribosome maturation. In addition, we have studied the dynamics of association and release of Mrt4 from pre-ribosomal particles and the relative position of a stable P0 assembly. Although other alternatives are possible, we propose a sequential association of Mrt4 and P0 with pre-60S r-particles. Mrt4 is a nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling factor. When ribosome export is impaired, P0 remains cytoplasmic; therefore, the replacement of Mrt4 by P0 might take place mostly in the cytoplasm, being a prerequisite to recycle back Mrt4 to the nucleolus.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Strains, plasmids and microbiological methods</title><p>The <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strains used in this study are listed in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp806/DC1">Table S1</ext-link>.

Nine to twelve hours after the transfer of the conditional P0 strains to YPD, the growth rate began to slow down and finally stopped.

This decrease was more drastic upon depletion of P0. A mild increase of the 35S/32S pre-rRNA ratio was observed following loss of Mrt4 or at early times of depletion of P0; this was accompanied by reduced levels of 27SA<sub>2</sub> and 20S pre-rRNAs and the detection of the aberrant 23S pre-rRNA; however, pre-rRNAs are eventually turned over at late times of depletion of P0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A).

While Rpl25-eGFP was found, as expected for a r-protein, predominantly in the cytoplasm in all strains under permissive culture conditions, most of the cells from both <italic>GAL::RPP0</italic> and <italic>&#x00394;mrt4 GAL::RPP0</italic> strains exhibited an accumulation of the reporter in the nucleus, following a 12&#x02013;18 h shift to a glucose medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). In some cells, the fluorescence signal for Rpl25-eGFP was restricted to the nucleolus, which was detected with the nucleolar marker DsRed-Nop1. In contrast, nuclear accumulation of Rpl25-eGFP was not observed in either the <italic>mrt4</italic> null or the wild-type strain, under our experimental conditions. All these phenomena are specific for the large r-subunit, since no nuclear fluorescence accumulation was observed when we studied the location of the 40S r-subunit reporter Rps2-eGFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>) either in galactose (data not shown) or in a glucose medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>We conclude that both intra-nuclear and nucleo-cytoplasmic transport of pre-60S r-particles is blocked upon depletion of P0 but not after deletion of <italic>MRT4</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Mrt4 is associated with medium pre-60S r-particles</title><p>Since the interaction of Mrt4 and P0 with r-particles is mutually exclusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>), we reasoned that defining the association of Mrt4 precisely with pre-ribosomal particles would help understand the position and timing of the P0 assembly. In sucrose gradients, Mrt4 is associated with high-molecular-mass particles of a size overlapping the 60S/80S peaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>). To characterize these particles, we tagged Mrt4 with a C-terminal TAP cassette. After TAP purification, Mrt4 co-purifed with several proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A). Mass spectrometry identification of the most abundant bands revealed nucle(ol)ar pre-60S r-assembly factors and r-proteins mostly from the 60S r-subunit. Among these proteins, we found Nop7, Erb1 and Nsa3, which are indicators of early pre-60S r-particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>), Nug1 and Nog2, which are indicators of medium/late pre-60S r-particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>) and Arx1, which is an indicator of a late/cytoplasmic pre-60S r-particle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). To determine which pre-rRNA species are present in the purified particles, co-precipitated RNA was analysed by northern. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C, there was a significant enrichment for 7S pre-rRNA and to a lesser extent, for 27SB pre-rRNA in the purified particles. In addition, mature rRNAs were modestly co-precipitated over the background levels detected for those rRNAs purified from the untagged strain.</p><p>To further address the binding properties of Mrt4 to pre-ribosomal particles, we screened for the presence of Mrt4 in TAP purification of selected 90S (Pwp2/Utp1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>) and factors (Npa2/Urb2, Nsa3/Cic1, Nop7/Yph1, Nug1, Rix1/Ipi2, Sda1, Arx1 and Kre35/Lsg1) known to purify early, medium, late and cytoplasmic pre-60S r-particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>). As a result (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>), Mrt4 was enriched in early (Nsa3&#x02013;TAP and Nop7&#x02013;TAP) and medium (Nug1&#x02013;TAP) pre-60S r-particles while it was notably reduced in late (Sda1&#x02013;TAP and Rix1&#x02013;TAP) and late/cytoplasmic (Arx1&#x02013;TAP) pre-60S complexes. Mrt4 was absent from 90S (Pwp2&#x02013;TAP), the earliest pre-60S (Npa2&#x02013;TAP) and cytoplasmic pre-60S r-particles (Lsg1&#x02013;TAP).</p></sec><sec><title>Mrt4 shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm</title><p>Mrt4 has been mostly localized in the nucleolus with a fainter nucleoplasmic staining at steady-state levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp806/DC1">Figure S3A</ext-link>). To test whether Mrt4 shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm, the <italic>&#x00394;mrt4</italic> strain expressing Mrt4-eGFP was mated with a strain carrying the <italic>kar1-1</italic> mutation, which prevents nuclear fusion following mating, leading to formation of heterokaryons. As a positive control, we used Arx1-eGFP, which is a late shuttling pre-60S r-assembly factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>). As a negative control, we used the nucleolar Nop7-eGFP, which is expected to be retained in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>, Mrt4-eGFP, just as Arx1-eGFP, was detected in both nuclei of heterokaryons while Nop7-eGFP was localized to only one of the nuclei. As an additional experiment, we co-expressed Mrt4-eGFP and DsRed-Nop1 in the same strain, which was also crossed with the <italic>kar1-1</italic> strain. In this case, while Mrt4-eGFP was detected in both nuclei of heterokaryons, DsRed-Nop1 was only found in one of them (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp806/DC1">Figure S4</ext-link>).</p><p>Altogether, these data indicate that Mrt4 is a stable component of medium nucle(ol)ar pre-60S r-particles containing 7S pre-rRNAs. Mrt4 apparently associates with pre-60S r-particles at some point after the formation of 27SB pre-rRNA and dissociates from particles after nuclear export. Then, Mrt4 must be rapidly recycled back to the nucle(ol)us.</p></sec><sec><title>P0 associates with late pre-60S r-particles</title><p>To address whether the binding of P0 to pre-60S r-particles is concomitant to dissociation of Mrt4, we analysed selected TAP-purified complexes by western blotting for the presence of P0. Taken into account the previous data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>), Nop7&#x02013;TAP, Nug1&#x02013;TAP and Arx1&#x02013;TAP were selected as representative of the distinct phases of 60S r-subunit assembly. In addition, Lsg1&#x02013;TAP and a preparation of purified ribosomes were included. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A, while the P0/Mrt4 band intensity ratio was roughly one in the Nop7&#x02013;TAP complexes, the P0 signal was drastically reduced in the Nug1&#x02013;TAP while the Mrt4 signal was reduced in the Arx1&#x02013;TAP and absent in the Lsg1&#x02013;TAP preparation.</p><p>Next, we tested whether the association of P0 with pre-60S r-particles was dependent on Mrt4. Thus, Nop7&#x02013;TAP, Nug1&#x02013;TAP and Arx1&#x02013;TAP were also purified from <italic>mrt4</italic> null cells and the presence of P0 again analysed by western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A). The amount of P0 found in the Arx1&#x02013;TAP complexes was not affected by the absence of Mrt4; however, a significant increase was detected in the Nop7&#x02013;TAP and the Nug1&#x02013;TAP particles purified from <italic>mrt4</italic> null cells. In both cases, the P0/Rpl1 ratio was similar to that of purified ribosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A).</p><p>TAP purifications can be contaminated by r-proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). Therefore, to exclude the possibility that association of P0 with the tested TAP complexes is the consequence of unspecific contamination during purification, we mixed equal amounts of cells from <italic>&#x00394;mrt4</italic> cells expressing TAP-tagged or untagged versions of either Nop7 or Nug1. The untagged cells expressed as a sole source of functional P0 a truncated protein (P0-C) lacking the last 21 amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>), easily distinguishable from the wild-type protein by SDS&#x02013;PAGE. After purification from the mixed extracts, only the wild-type but not the truncated P0-C protein was found associated with the TAP purified particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B). Similar results were obtained using a His<sub>6</sub>-P0 as a contamination marker (data not shown). Thus, under the purification procedure assayed, the association of P0 with the purified particles was not a result of contamination.</p><p>We conclude that, in wild-type cells, P0 exchanges with Mrt4 at a very late stage during 60S r-subunit biogenesis, most specifically at the interface between Nug1 and Arx1 containing r-particles. However, P0 is also present in theoretically earlier pre-60S r-particles such as the ones containing Nop7 (but see Discussion section). The results obtained upon deletion of <italic>MRT4</italic> indicate that Mrt4 is not strictly required for P0 assembly in agreement with its non-essential role. In the absence of competition by Mrt4, P0 can prematurely associate with the medium pre-60S r-particles.</p></sec><sec><title>P0 localizes in the cytoplasm after blocking nuclear export of pre-ribosomal particles</title><p>To address whether the Mrt4 to P0 exchange takes place in the nucleus or in the cytoplasm, we monitored localization of a fully functional P0-eGFP in a LMB sensitive strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>). This sensitivity is due to the presence of the T539C mutation in the exportin Crm1/Xpo1. Treatment of the sensitive strain with LMB impairs export of pre-ribosomal particles and causes their accumulation in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>A, the Rpl25-eGFP was localized in the cytoplasm in untreated cells but trapped in the nucleus after a treatment with LMB. In contrast, P0-eGFP, which is also found in the cytoplasm in untreated cells, remained cytoplasmic after a treatment with LMB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>B). This location is not altered by the deletion of <italic>MRT4</italic> in the LMB sensitive strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>C). Similar results were obtained using other P0-eGFP constructs described in &#x02018;Materials and Methods&#x02019; section (data not shown). It must be noted that GFP tagging of P0 might not hinder its import to the nucleus as indicated by the association of P0-eGFP with the Nop7&#x02013;TAP complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>C). Moreover, when cell fractionation was performed by centrifugation, P0-eGFP was exclusively present in the pellet but not in the S100 supernatant fraction even after the LMB treatment. Thus, P0 seems not to accumulate as a free protein in the cytoplasm upon pre-ribosomal particle export inhibition (data not shown).</p><p>Altogether, these data strongly suggest that, independently of the presence of Mrt4, P0 assembles in cytoplasmic pre-60S r-particles.</p></sec><sec><title>P0 is required for the release of Mrt4 from pre-60S r-particles</title><p>To address a possible role of P0 in the release of Mrt4 from pre-60S r-particles, we re-analysed the dynamics of 60S assembly upon P0 depletion.

Interestingly, Nop7&#x02013;TAP and Arx1&#x02013;TAP-tagged preparations from P0-depleted extracts of the <italic>GAL::RPP0</italic> strain lack Mrt4 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp806/DC1">Figure S5</ext-link>), suggesting that these two proteins have dissociated from the aberrant particles.</p><p>Altogether, our data indicate that Mrt4 does require P0 to be efficiently displaced from cytoplasmic pre-60S r-particles in order to recycle back to the nucleus.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In this work, we have addressed the functional characterisation in ribosome biogenesis of P0, the central component of the r-stalk, and its homologous r-protein-like Mrt4. The architecture of this essential r-domain has been extensively studied mainly in prokaryotes by distinct techniques, which evaluate the interactions between its components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). The eukaryotic r-stalk structure is less stable than its prokaryotic counterpart and seems to modulate the cell translation activity through a mechanism that involves the exchange between ribosome-bound and free cytoplasmic stalk components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>). Unfortunately, there is little information available on the role of P0 and its prokaryotic counterpart L10 in ribosome biogenesis. In eukaryotes, a notable sequence homology exists between P0 and the non-essential ribosome synthesis factor Mrt4, which suggests a functional relationship between both proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>). In yeast, the absence of either P0 or Mrt4, which is lethal only in the first case, leads to a deficit of active 60S relative to 40S r-subunits [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>]. In agreement with this information, we show herein that both proteins are required for the production of 25S and 5.8S rRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp806/DC1">Figure S2</ext-link>); deletion of <italic>MRT4</italic> and depletion of P0 affects pre-rRNA processing leading to a discrete accumulation of 35S and upon early times of P0 depletion also of aberrant 23S pre-rRNA. This is a general feature in many strains affected in 60S r-subunit biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>) that most likely occurs due to failure of recycling of <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors required for the early pre-rRNA cleavages at sites A<sub>0</sub>&#x02013;A<sub>2</sub> that improperly dissociate from defective pre-60S r-particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Most importantly, the absence of Mrt4 and the depletion of P0 lead to reduced steady-state levels of all 27S and 7S pre-rRNAs and, therefore, of mature 25S and 5.8S rRNAs. In general, the pre-rRNA processing defects detected upon depletion of P0 were more drastic than those after the deletion of <italic>MRT4</italic>. In addition, depletion of P0 is epistatic over and synergistic with the absence of Mrt4, confirming the functional relationship between the two proteins. Since it is unlikely that either P0 or Mrt4 have a <italic>direct</italic> role in 27S pre-rRNA processing reactions, we assume that the depletion of P0 and the absence of Mrt4 lead to defective assembly of early pre-60S r-particles, which causes destabilisation and efficient degradation of the 27S pre-rRNAs and their products. More relevant concerning the final ribosome yield of the conditional systems tested is the fact that P0 depleted but not <italic>MRT4</italic> deleted cells accumulated Rpl25-eGFP within the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Rpl25 has been suggested as assembling early during ribosome biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). This result suggests a block in nucleo-cytoplasmic export of defective pre-60S r-particles that lack P0 and/or other factor limited upon P0 depletion but not of pre-60S r-particles assembled in the absence of Mrt4.</p><p>Mrt4 has been previously shown to localize to the nucleolus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>) and found to be associated with many pre-60S r-particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). Moreover, Mrt4&#x02013;TAP complexes co-enriched defined pre-60S r-particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). Analysis of the RNA composition of these complexes indicates that Mrt4 might bind to pre-60S r-particles soon after formation of 27SB pre-rRNAs and apparently dissociate only when pre-rRNA processing reactions have been completed. At steady-state levels, Mrt4 appears to stably concentrate in medium/late pre-60S r-particles, which contains 7S pre-rRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). The protein composition of the Mrt4&#x02013;TAP complexes also reflects this fact and indeed most of the <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors and r-proteins identified have been previously listed as components of Nug1&#x02013;TAP complexes, which are considered the representatives of nuclear medium pre-60S r-particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). On the other hand, our heterokaryon assay data strongly suggest that Mrt4 travels associated with those nuclear pre-60S r-particles that exit to the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). There, Mrt4 dissociates from the particles and is efficiently reimported to the nucleus in order to maintain its steady-state nuclear distribution. Shuttling factors often require other proteins to be released from the cytoplasmic pre-60S r-particles and/or recycled back to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67 B68 B69 B70">67&#x02013;70</xref>), amongst them, Drg1, which is an ATPase required for the release of Arx1, Rlp24, Nog1 and Tif6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>), and Efl1/Ria1 and Lsg1, which are GTPases required for optimal dissociation of Tif6 and Nmd3, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>). Little is known about Mrt4 releasing factors; our data suggest that the GTPase Nug1 does not seem to have this role since Mrt4 does not mislocalize upon loss of its function. Very recently, while this manuscript was being prepared, Johnson and co-workers have shown that the efficient release of Mrt4 from pre-60S r-particles requires the participation of the non-essential phosphatase Yvh1 that associates with late pre-60S r-particles (A.W. Johnson, personal communication).</p><p>When and how is P0 assembled? We have previously shown that P0 and Mrt4 interact in a mutually exclusive manner to the 25S rRNA GAR domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>). Taking this into account, a simple model where Mrt4 and P0 successively occupy the GAR domain in pre-60S r-particles and mature 60S r-subunits, respectively, can be envisaged for the timing of P0 assembly. Since our data strongly suggest that Mrt4 dissociates from late, most likely cytoplasmic, pre-60S r-particles, the exchange of Mrt4 with P0 might take place mainly in the cytoplasm, which is agreement with the interpretation of LMB experiments. Thus, if P0 predominantly assembled in the nucleus, we would expect the export of P0-containing pre-60S r-particles to be Crm1-dependent in the LMB-sensitive strain. However, functional GFP-tagged P0 did not relocalize to the nucleus in the presence of LMB even in the absence of Mrt4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>). Moreover, we show here that, in wild-type cells, P0 is practically absent from some Mrt4-containing medium pre-60S r-particles such as the Nug1&#x02013;TAP complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>). These results are in agreement with those previously reported for Nog1-, Nog2- and Rlp24&#x02013;TAP complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>), Nsa1-defined pre-60S r-particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>) and Nsa3&#x02013;TAP and Ssf1&#x02013;TAP complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>), all of which lack P0 as tested using either mass-spectrometry or specific antibodies. On the contrary, P0 is clearly present in late complexes such as the ones obtained using Arx1&#x02013;TAP as bait, which contain little Mrt4 and cytoplasmic complexes such as the Lsg1&#x02013;TAP ones, which lack Mrt4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p>Our data also demonstrate that release of Mrt4 from pre-60S particles requires the presence of P0. This conclusion is based on the fact that Mrt4-eGFP mislocalized to the cytoplasm upon P0 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>), where it is still associated with high-molecular-mass complexes, most likely inactive almost mature 60S r-subunits lacking P0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B and C). These complexes strongly accumulated increasing the free 60S peak in polysome profiles even in the absence of bound Mrt4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D and F). Our experimental approaches do not address whether Mrt4 is preferentially released from pre-60S r-particles via a <italic>direct</italic> displacement by P0 or via a <italic>trans</italic>-acting factor. As above mentioned, it has been recently shown that Yvh1 is required for removing Mrt4 from late pre-60S r-particles that are then susceptible to bind P0 in the cytoplasm (A.W. Johnson, personal communication).</p><p>In apparent contradiction with the previous data, which strongly support that an important part of P0 is assembled in the cytoplasm after an exchange with Mrt4, the Nop7&#x02013;TAP purified complexes contain a significant amount of both Mrt4 and P0. The presence of both proteins in these particles reflect heterogeneous composition since it is known that Nop7&#x02013;TAP complexes are a mixture of several early, medium and even late pre-60S intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>), see also (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>). Nevertheless, since Nop7 seems to be a nuclear protein, which is unable to shuttle between the nucleus and the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>), some P0 must assemble in the nucleus. Accordingly, the study of the P0 assembly dynamics in the <italic>mrt4</italic> null mutant also leads to interesting conclusions being the most obvious one that P0 does not strictly require Mrt4 for association with pre-60S r-particles. Strikingly, in <italic>mrt4</italic> null cells, the amount of P0 increases in both Nop7-and Nug1&#x02013;TAP particles to proportions close to that of mature ribosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>), indicating that in the absence of Mrt4, the nuclear assembly of P0 is enhanced. Some of these particles might be subjected to surveillance and degradation, which provide an explanation for the net 60S r-subunit deficit in <italic>mrt4</italic> null cells; however, since active ribosomes are still synthesized in these cells, this alternative Mrt4-independent P0 assembly pathway that may operate even in the presence of Mrt4 cannot be excluded.</p><p>Several arguments could help to understand the apparent discrepancy of the data supporting both a nuclear and a cytoplasmic assembly of P0: (i) the fraction of P0 that assemble in the nucleus could be minor versus that assembling in the cytoplasm and thus P0-eGFP should not be detected there after the LMB treatment, (ii) export of pre-60S r-particles containing P0 could be independent of Crm1, (iii) the GFP bait, although shown not to interfere with the function of P0 and its capability of association with nuclear Nop7&#x02013;TAP complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>C), could influence the import of the P0-eGFP protein in the nucleus after the treatment with LMB, as earlier discussed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Further experiments are required to solve the questions raised; however, the possibility that ribosome biogenesis operates as a mesh of pathways rather than as a linear series of events has been previously suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). This is an appealing possibility as a source of eukaryotic ribosome heterogeneity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">72</xref>), which starts being considered on the bases of new ribosome-dependent translation regulatory mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">73</xref>). The existence of alternative assembly pathways, at least for some r-components, might also explain some of the paradoxical paralogue-specific effects recently reported for duplicated genes encoding r-proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">74</xref>). <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp806/DC1">Figure S6</ext-link> summarizes the conclusions of this study concerning the role of Mrt4 and the assembly of P0 in wild-type conditions, in the absence of Mrt4 or upon depletion of P0.</p><p>In <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, L10 is a component of the RI50[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] complex, which is the first <italic>in vitro</italic> reconstitution intermediate of 50S r-subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">75</xref>). <italic>In vivo</italic>, it seems that L10 assembles in the p<sub>1</sub>50S complex, which is the earliest of the three pre-50S r-particles detected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">76</xref>). Thus, the prokaryotic and eukaryotic scenarios seem to be different and it prompted us to speculate whether Mrt4 appeared during evolution to optimize ribosome assembly by preventing <italic>early</italic> P0 assembly. Our structural models indicate that P0 binds a little tighter than Mrt4 to the GAR domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>); therefore, it is possible that the premature binding of P0 to early nuclear pre-ribosomal particles could impede its appropriate maturation by interfering in defined structural rearrangements within these particles. Additionally, replacement of an r-protein-like factor by its r-protein counterpart might provide directionality to the ribosome synthesis process throughout different subcellular regions (nucleolus, nucleoplasm, cytoplasm) and opportunities for quality control mechanisms. Mrt4-P0 is not the sole example of a paralogue pair comprised of a non-ribosomal factor and a r-protein. Factors Imp3, Rlp7, Rlp24 show significant homology to r-proteins Rps9, Rpl7 and Rpl24, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B77 B78 B79">77&#x02013;79</xref>). It would be appealing to understand whether or not all these pairs have arisen during evolution to deal with similar situations during ribosome biogenesis.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp806/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation (MICINN) and FEDER (BFU2007-60151 to J.d.l.C., BFU2007-64280 to M.R. and BFU2006-00365 to J.P.G.B.), the Andalusian Government (CVI-271, P07-CVI-02623 and P08-CVI-03508 to J.d.l.C.) and Ram&#x000f3;n Areces Foundation (Institutional Grant to C.B.M.S.O.).
