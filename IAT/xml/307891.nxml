Concerted efforts in several laboratories have revealed multiple Go alpha mRNAs and protein isoforms in different contexts. Go alpha is a single copy gene in mammalian species, although the structure, number and tissue localization of Go alpha mRNAs reported by investigators are inconsistent. To define the cell-specific expression of alternatively spliced variants of Go alpha mRNA, we employed several strategies, including Northern hybridizations with sequences-specific oligonucleotides, selective digestions of Go alpha mRNA using RNase H, and adaptations of the polymerase chain reaction. Four distinct alternatively spliced variants were identified, a 5.7-kb Go alpha 2 mRNA and three Go alpha 1 mRNAs with different 3' UTRs. The UTRs of the three Go alpha 1s are composed of different combinations of what have been referred to as UTR-A and UTR-B. The sequences of the spliced segments are well conserved among mammalian species, suggesting a functional role for these alternatively spliced 3' UTRs in post-transcriptional and/or tissue-specific regulation of Go alpha expression. The position of the intron-exon splice boundary at nucleotide 31 following T of the TGA stop codon is conserved in the Gi alpha 2 and Gi alpha 3 genes, consistent with the notion that similar alternative splicing of 3' UTRs occurs in products of these related genes.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00029-0156-a" xlink:role="846"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00029-0157-a" xlink:role="847"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00029-0152.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="842"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00029-0153.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="843"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00029-0154.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="844"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00029-0155.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="845"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00029-0156.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="846"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00029-0157.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="847"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00029-0158.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="848"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00029-0159.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="849"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
