Reversal of functional ischemia via pharmacological manipulation prevented contraction-induced myofiber damage in <italic>mdx</italic> mice, the murine equivalent of DMD. This result indicates that functional ischemia is required for, and thus an essential cause of, muscle damage in <italic>mdx</italic> mice. Next, to determine whether functional ischemia alone is enough to explain the disease, the extent of ischemia and the amount of myofiber damage were compared both in control and <italic>mdx</italic> mice. In control mice, functional ischemia alone was found insufficient to cause a similar degree of myofiber damage observed in <italic>mdx</italic> mice.

Ischemia is defined as the state of blood flow decrease due to structural vascular obstruction or vasoconstriction. Functional ischemia is a status where blood flow cannot match the metabolic demand of tissues even in the absence of vascular obstruction. The balance between the demand and supply of blood flow is disturbed in both cases.</p><p>Nitric oxide (NO), a.k.a. endothelium-derived relaxing factor (EDRF), produced in skeletal muscles controls local blood flow in the muscle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000806-Lau1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000806-Stamler1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref> along with various other vasoregulatory molecules.

Various studies have reported vascular pathology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000806-Burbach1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000806-Musch1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, altered vasodilative response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000806-Hunter1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000806-Miyatake1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, and disturbed vasodilative signaling downstream of nNOS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000806-Lau2">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. What has not been evaluated in detail, however, is whether blood flow dysregulation due to lack of nNOS expression is a primary cause or a secondary defect of muscular dystrophies. Since nNOS knock-out mice showing similar blood flow abnormality <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000806-Thomas1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref> do not manifest phenotypes of muscular dystrophy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000806-Chao1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000806-Crosbie1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, it has been suggested that functional ischemia or lack of nNOS may be an auxiliary event but not a direct cause of the disease. Lack of a dystrophic phenotype in nNOS knock-out mice, however, means nothing more than that nNOS absence or blood flow abnormality is insufficient to cause muscular dystrophy. It is inaccurate to conclude that nNOS absence or disturbed circulation is not an essential cause of the disease. In addition to NO, tissues produce other types of vasodilatory factors, including endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000806-Komori1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>.

Observation of fluorescent RBC labeled by various dyes including PKH26GL is a well accepted method for analyzing microcirculation. To assess a possible influence of fluorescent labeling of the RBC by PKH26GL on the flow dynamics of RBCs, an alternative staining method (FITC) was used; the same pattern of kinetics (data not shown) was obtained, indicating there was no significant effect of the fluorescent staining. The basal level of the absolute crude RBC flux (stained and non-stained RBCs combined) were 8043.2&#x000b1;1372.5 and 10403.2&#x000b1;1876.0 for control and <italic>mdx</italic> mice (flux count per minute&#x000b1;S.E., N (numbers of animals)&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;18 and 17, not statistically different, p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.31 by t-test).

The y-axis represents the percent increase in the RBC number from the basal (100&#x00025;) RBC flux. (a) In response to the direct tetanic stimulation on the muscles of control mice, arterioles both at junctional (NMJ, closed square, red solid line), and extrajunctional (non-NMJ, open circle, black solid line) areas showed a transient increase in the RBC.

This observation suggests that under the conditions utilized in this study, the stimulus on the sternomastoid muscle did not alter the cardiac output, and the increase of blood flow was specific to the local stimulation of the muscle.</p><p>The m<italic>dx</italic> mouse experiments showed a total absence of increase of RBC flux after tetanic stimulation both in NMJ and non-NMJ areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000806-g001">Figure 1b</xref>) despite the fact that the tetanic stimuli yielded a similar extent of muscle contraction in <italic>mdx</italic> and control mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000806.s002">Figure S2</xref>, supporting information). To examine whether the lack of response in <italic>mdx</italic> mice was due to the defect in blood vessels or to the defect in the signal transmission between muscles and blood vessels, we applied SNAP (S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine, NO donor) locally. When SNAP was given to the resting muscles in <italic>mdx</italic> mice, the RBC flux was increased to a maximum of 212.4&#x00025; of basal flux (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000806-g001">Figure 1b</xref>). This increase was comparable to changes in control mice administered with the same dose of SNAP (data not shown, maximum increase up to 236.2&#x00025;, N (numbers of animals)&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;10, not significantly different from <italic>mdx</italic> mice at any time point between 0 and 8 minutes). This result suggested that vasodilatory mechanisms in the blood vessels were functional in the <italic>mdx</italic> mice but the signaling between skeletal muscles and blood vessels was compromised. A further confirmation of this finding was observed when a membrane permeable cGMP analogue, 8-(4-Chlorophenylthio)-guanosine 3&#x02032;, 5&#x02032;-cyclic monophosphate (8-CPT cGMP) was locally applied. This drug caused a slow increase in the RBC flux in <italic>mdx</italic> mice, reaching a similar extent of response to that seen in the SNAP group by 7 minutes after administration. Given that the vasodilatory effect of NO is through a cGMP-dependent pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000806-MacLeod1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000806-Ignarro1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>, the difference in the kinetics of RBC flux increase between groups with SNAP and with 8-CPT cGMP is likely due to the difference in the speed of the drugs to reach their target cells. The effect on RBC flux increase by 8-CPT cGMP is not a non-specific irreversible vaso-action, but is likely a specific physiological regulation, because this response was completely antagonized by a further addition of physiological concentration of a vasoconstrictor, angiotensin-II (ATII). Because &#x003b2;2-adrenergic agonists have a different mechanism of vasodilation that does not involve NO <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000806-Chiba1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>, we examined whether clenbuterol causes vasodilation in <italic>mdx</italic> mice.

The result from the clenbuterol experiment confirms that the mechanism of vasodilation inherent to the vascular smooth muscle is functional in <italic>mdx</italic> mice.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Nitric Oxide and hydrogen peroxide production in response to muscle contraction is attenuated in <italic>mdx</italic> mice</title><p><italic>In vivo</italic> production of vasodilatory molecules (i.e. NO and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) was measured in the sternomastoid muscles in <italic>mdx</italic> and control mice to investigate the mechanisms for functional ischemia in <italic>mdx</italic> mice.

With conventional assays, there is considerable amount of cell death even before pharmacological/molecular interventions are applied, masking the effect by interventions even if they induce further cell damage. Our new method of myofiber cell death eliminated the already dead cell population by using a membrane potential-dependent dye, DiOC<sub>6</sub>, which is incorporated only by live cells at the beginning of experiment. This new approach enabled quantification of the specific effect of physiopharmacological interventions and allowed simple and clear discussions.</p><p>By using direct observation of the live animals, we documented a complete lack of the stimulated production of two vasodilative molecules, NO and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, in response to muscle contraction: a possible cause of functional ischemia. Detailed observation detected a slightly elevated basal level of NO production in <italic>mdx</italic> mice, and its release from non-myofiber type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000806-g002">Figure 2</xref>).

The same finding was confirmed by application of clenbuterol or 8-CPT cGMP. Myofiber protection by 8-CPT cGMP is likely through a vascular control, because its benefit was completely abolished by further addition of ATII at the vasoconstrictive dose. This inhibitory effect of ATII is likely through vascular regulation, but not its direct catabolic function on myofibers, because ATII alone did not cause myofiber damage. These experiments suggested the primary role of functional ischemia in contraction-induced myofiber damage in <italic>mdx</italic> mice. Functional ischemia is necessary as a cause of contraction-induced myofiber damage.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Possible involvement of the other vasodilator, EDHF</title><p>Previous studies on EDHF were predominantly performed on vascular systems and to a lesser extent on skeletal myocytes. There have been many confounding opinions as to the identity of EDHF, its generation site, its action site, its existence as (a) secretable molecule(s), and involvement of gap-junctions, to name a few, leading to our putative understanding that EDHF is a heterogenic entity of vasodilative molecules/factors whose behavior is variable depending on the tissues of study. The action site of apamin and charybdotoxin, two well-established pharmacological inhibitors of EDHF, has also been controversial until recently. Previously, they were considered to work at the very downstream of EDHF function by inhibiting the hyperpolarization of vascular smooth muscle cells.

To induce contraction-dependent myofiber damage in control mice to the comparable extent of that of <italic>mdx</italic> mice, a more severe ischemia and more strenuous tetanic stimuli were necessary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000806-g005">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000806-g006">6</xref>). These results suggest that independent of abnormal blood flow response, myofibers in <italic>mdx</italic> mice are already vulnerable to mechanical stress. Our experiments have demonstrated the existence of at least two causes leading to contraction-induced myofiber damage in <italic>mdx</italic> mice: (i) a pharmacologically treatable factor (RBC flux), which is mediated by NO/EDHF and possibly other molecules, and (ii) elements independent of NO/EDHF or blood flow regulation (supporting information <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000806.s008">Figure S8a&#x02013;d</xref>).

Neither one of these two factors alone causes muscle damage to the level observed in <italic>mdx</italic> mice. Only when the above two factors are affected (&#x0201c;hit&#x0201d;) at the molecular or pathophysiological level, does the muscle develop significant amount of damage.</p><p>Despite the result showing that inhibition of only NO production is not enough to cause cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000806-g005">Figure 5</xref>), it is intriguing that addition of SNAP (an NO donor) can prevent contraction-induced cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000806-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Perhaps mammals have evolved so that there are redundant factors provided for muscle contraction-induced blood flow increase and protection from contraction-induced stress. Thus, even if EDHF synthesis/function fails, another factor such as NO may substitute in its absence and vice versa. Replenishing NO can, by itself, normalize the blood flow and prevent ischemia-induced injury despite the possibility that the affected muscles are still inherently susceptible to contraction-induced damage.</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>PDE5 Inhibitors can be a potential therapeutic agent to treat DMD</title><p>Additional support linking vasoregulation to the cause of muscular dystrophy was demonstrated by the effective treatment of the <italic>mdx</italic> mice with a PDE5 inhibitor, tadalafil.

Although vasoactive agents (NO, 8CPT-cGMP, and clenbuterol) almost completely prevented myofiber damage in our short-term experiments from <italic>in vivo</italic> microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000806-g004">Figure 4</xref>), there was still remaining myofiber damage observed in some animals treated with tadalafil (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000806-g007">Figure 7a and 7b</xref>).

Biologically, our data from experiments in tadalafil treatment supports that histological changes are due to the increased turnover of muscle degeneration and regeneration. The numbers of myofibers with central nuclei, characteristic of active regeneration was reduced by tadalafil treatment. This observation suggests that PDE5I can ameliorate the progress of the disease mainly through its myofiber protective function, but not through upregulation of regeneration and that regeneration of myofibers often observed in <italic>mdx</italic> mice may occur secondarily to upregulated muscle degeneration.

Postsynaptic acetylcholine receptors were labeled with 1 &#x000b5;g/ml of Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated &#x003b1;-BTX for 10 minutes. According to previous studies, this dosage did not block postsynaptic activity. DiOC<sub>6</sub> (80nM, 15 min) stains mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (M/ER) only in live cells. At this concentration, DiOC<sub>6</sub> staining was not cytotoxic to skeletal muscle cells. DiOC<sub>6</sub> yielded irreversible staining and remained on their specific target until they were removed by the biological turn-over or underwent fluorescence bleaching. Thus, documentation of the chronological alteration in the morphology of neuromuscular junctions (NMJs) and of organelles was possible. Specific tissue sites were identified and followed using the shape and location of NMJs as signposts. In <italic>mdx</italic> mice, a 5 second tetanic stimulation (TS) was applied 6 times as described above. In control mice the TS was applied 6 or 12 times and compared. Stained muscles were recorded at 30 minutes, 2 hours, 4 hours and 6 hours after stimulation. Video images were recorded using an intensified SIT camera at 30 frames per second, recorded on DVD, and the numbers of dead myofiber loci in the entire muscle were counted manually.</p></sec><sec id="s4f2"><title>Fiber Loci Counting and Criteria for Myofiber Damage</title><p>We counted between 70 and 80 myofibers per scan for both control and <italic>mdx</italic> mice.

To scan the whole area, the microscopic image field was moved transversely (along x-axis) back and forth, shifting along y-axis with each scan (supporting information, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000806.s004">Figure S4a</xref>). For the feasibility of counting, fibers in different image fields of observation were regarded as different. Thus, scan #1 (supporting information, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000806.s004">Figure S4a</xref>) counted fibers from 1 to 70, scan #2 counted from 71 to 140, and so forth. The grand total numbers of counted fibers of 350 to 400 (70 to 80 multiplied by the numbers of 5 transverse scan) covered the actual area size of approximately 10 mm<sup>2</sup> and were consistent throughout the experiment, both for control and for <italic>mdx</italic> mice. Because of the anatomical structure of the sternomastoid muscle, the distal (mastoid) end of the muscle tissue was not counted. Granulated, rippled, or bulged cluster of staining with DiOC<sub>6</sub> were considered as criteria to define abnormal distribution of M/ER of damaged fibers. Myofibers manifesting any of these traits eventually led to regional cell death, as detected by the dye exclusion staining method using propidium iodide (1 &#x000b5;g/ml, 15 min) or Hoechst 33258 (2 &#x000b5;g/ml, 3 min) and Annexin-V AlexaFluor 350 staining (30 min). By our criteria, granular, rippled, and bulged areas within a single fiber were counted as one damaged myofiber locus as long as the lesion was continuous (supporting information, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0000806.s004">Figure S4b</xref>). If any two lesions were separated by an intact area with a normally striated pattern extending into different field of observation, those were counted separately. If two lesions were not continuous, and were separated by an area where staining was completely lost, or the fiber was severed, resulting in different fields of observation, those were regarded as different loci.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4g"><title>Tadalafil Treatment and Evans Blue Assay</title><p>To achieve oral administration of tadalafil, <italic>mdx</italic> mice were treated with 1mg tadalafil/100 ml drinking water from the beginning of pregnancy.

Ectopic fibrosis was determined by the specific blue color deposition from trichrome staining followed by image analysis with Metamorph on cross sections (gastrocnemius, gluteus, quadriceps) or longitudinal sections (diaphragm). We excluded areas for tendons, normal epimysiums, perimysiums and endomysiums as well as metachromatic myofibers (presumably unhealthy myofibers). 10 to 20 random areas are chosen from 3 different sections.

Contracting skeletal muscles require an increased blood flow to meet metabolic demands. Functional ischemia is a pathological state where this normal response is disturbed. (a) In order to observe functional ischemia, the previous studies measuring crude macroscopic blood flow required the muscles to be put under vasoconstrictive stress by sympathetic stimulants. Skeletal muscle contraction reverts the drop in the crude blood flow in normal muscles (a normal response of sympatholysis). Sympatholysis is absent in the affected muscles where normal vascular regulation mechanisms are lacking. Thus, normal muscles are rescued from ischemia by sympathetic vasoconstriction when superimposed by contractile stress but diseased muscles are put under the risk of continued ischemia. (b) In our new microscopic study, preloading with vasoconstrictive stress is unnecessary to observe functional ischemia. RBC flux increases after muscle contraction in normal subjects. This increase in RBC flux is perturbed in <italic>mdx</italic> mice. One of the technical advantages in analyzing RBC flux is to reveal a functional ischemia by a simpler scheme of stimulation than previous macroscopic studies. This observation is reasonable considering our understanding that the crude macroscopic blood flow measurement does not necessarily reflect peripheral (microscopic) RBC flux <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000806-Tsai2">&#x0005b;61&#x0005d;</xref>.
