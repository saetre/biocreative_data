The crystal structure of the SeqA C-terminal domain with hemimethylated DNA revealed the <italic>N</italic><sup>6</sup>-methyladenine recognition mechanism; however, the mechanism of discrimination between the hemimethylated and fully methylated states has remained elusive. In the present study, we performed mutational analyses of hemimethylated G-<sup>m</sup>A-T-C sequences with the minimal DNA-binding domain of SeqA (SeqA<sub>71&#x02013;181</sub>), and found that SeqA<sub>71&#x02013;181</sub> specifically binds to hemimethylated DNA containing a sequence with a mismatched <sup>m</sup>A:G base pair &#x0005b;G-<sup>m</sup>A(:G)-T-C&#x0005d; as efficiently as the normal hemimethylated G-<sup>m</sup>A(:T)-T-C sequence. We determined the crystal structures of SeqA<sub>71&#x02013;181</sub> complexed with the mismatched and normal hemimethylated DNAs at 2.5 and 3.0 &#x0212b; resolutions, respectively, and found that the mismatched <sup>m</sup>A:G base pair and the normal <sup>m</sup>A:T base pair are recognized by SeqA in a similar manner. Furthermore, in both crystal structures, an electron density is present near the unmethylated adenine, which is only methylated in the fully methylated state. This electron density, which may be due to a water molecule or a metal ion, can exist in the hemimethylated state, but not in the fully methylated state, because of steric clash with the additional methyl group.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes id="N0x94d0c50.0x9a044c8" notes-type="data_link"><p>PDB nos 1IU3 and 1J3E</p></notes></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> chromosome contains 19 130 G-A-T-C sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh173c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh173c2">2</xref>), which are normally methylated at the N6 position of the adenine bases (<italic>N</italic><sup>6</sup>-methyladenines) on both strands by the Dam methyltransferase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh173c3">3</xref>). After replication, the adenine bases in the G-A-T-C sequences of the newly synthesized strand are immediately methylated, except for the 11 G-A-T-C sites within the replication origin, termed <italic>oriC</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh173c4">4</xref>). Actually, for nearly one-third of the cell cycle, the replicated duplexes in the <italic>oriC</italic> region remain in the hemimethylated state, where the <italic>N</italic><sup>6</sup>-methyladenine exists only in the parental strand. The next round of replication is not initiated from the hemimethylated <italic>oriC</italic> region, as the replication of chromosomal DNA is strictly regulated to occur once per cell cycle (synchronous replication initiation) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh173c4">4</xref>). Therefore, the prolonged maintenance of the hemimethylated state at <italic>oriC</italic> is considered to prevent the premature initiation of replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh173c4">4</xref>).</p><p>The <italic>E.coli</italic> SeqA protein specifically binds to the hemimethylated G-<sup>m</sup>A-T-C sequence in the <italic>oriC</italic> region, and prohibits the assembly of replication proteins, such as DnaA, onto the <italic>oriC</italic> region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh173c5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh173c9">9</xref>). Thus, SeqA prevents the premature initiation of chromosomal replication within one cell cycle, through its hemimethylated DNA binding. To do so, SeqA must discriminate the hemimethylated state from the fully methylated state. In fact, the affinity of SeqA for the hemimethylated G-<sup>m</sup>A-T-C sequence is much stronger than that for the fully methylated sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh173c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh173c11">11</xref>). The SeqA protein is composed of 181 amino acid residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh173c12">12</xref>), and has two functional domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh173c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh173c14">14</xref>). The N-terminal domain, consisting of amino acid residues 1&#x02013;50, is responsible for the self-association of SeqA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh173c13">13</xref>), while the minimal DNA-binding domain has been mapped on the C-terminal domain, consisting of amino acid residues 71&#x02013;181 (SeqA<sub>71&#x02013;181</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh173c14">14</xref>). Consistent with the results from the full-length protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh173c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh173c11">11</xref>), SeqA<sub>71&#x02013;181</sub> exhibits stronger affinity for hemimethylated DNA than for fully methylated DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh173c14">14</xref>).</p><p>The structure of the SeqA C-terminal segment (51&#x02013;181 amino acids) has been determined in a complex with hemimethylated DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh173c13">13</xref>). In the structure, SeqA specifically recognizes the N6-methyl group of methyladenine by two van der Waals contacts, and the propeller angle of the thymine base, which is the pairing partner with <italic>N</italic><sup>6</sup>-methyladenine, is significantly distorted by a base-specific hydrogen bond (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh173c13">13</xref>). In contrast, the discrimination mechanism between the hemimethylated and fully methylated states was not elucidated, because fully methylated DNA can be accommodated without clashes with the C-terminal domain of SeqA in the modeled structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh173c13">13</xref>). Furthermore, the sequence-specific interactions between SeqA and the G-<sup>m</sup>A-T-C sequence are limited to the 5&#x02032; three base pairs (G-<sup>m</sup>A-T) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh173c13">13</xref>), whereas previous biochemical studies showed that the entire G-<sup>m</sup>A-T-C sequence is essential for the SeqA&#x02013;DNA interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh173c15">15</xref>).</p><p>In the present study, we first used gel-shift assays to analyze the binding of SeqA<sub>71&#x02013;181</sub> to a 14mer DNA containing the hemimethylated G-<sup>m</sup>A-T-C sequence with a series of mutations. These analyses revealed that all four of the base pairs are characteristically recognized by SeqA<sub>71&#x02013;181</sub>. We also unexpectedly found that SeqA<sub>71&#x02013;181</sub> can specifically bind DNA containing a hemimethylated sequence with a mismatched <sup>m</sup>A:G pair, G-<sup>m</sup>A(:G)-T-C, as strongly as the normal hemimethylated G-<sup>m</sup>A(:T)-T-C sequence. We determined two crystal structures of SeqA<sub>71&#x02013;181</sub> complexed with a 10mer DNA, with either the G-<sup>m</sup>A(:G)-T-C or G-<sup>m</sup>A(:T)-T-C sequence. In the 2.5 &#x0212b; structure with the mismatched hemimethylated sequence, the propeller angle of the guanine base, which is the pairing partner of the <italic>N</italic><sup>6</sup>-methyladenine, is distorted by about &#x02013;35&#x000b0; to form a base-specific hydrogen bond with Asn152, similar to the thymine base in the structure with the normal hemimethylated DNA. The methyl group of the <italic>N</italic><sup>6</sup>-methyladenine is recognized by the van der Waals contacts of Thr151 and Asn152, as in the normal hemimethylated DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh173c13">13</xref>). Furthermore, we found an electron density near the unmethylated adenine base, which is methylated only in the fully methylated state, in both crystal structures. The electron density, which is due to a water molecule or a metal ion, causes steric clash with the additional methyl group in the fully methylated state, and may be important in discriminating between hemimethylated and fully methylated DNA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Construction and purification of the SeqA<sub>71&#x02013;181</sub> protein</title><p>The DNA fragment encoding SeqA<sub>71&#x02013;181</sub>, which contained amino acid residues 71&#x02013;181, was ligated into the BamHI site of the pGEX-6P expression vector.

The resulting initial phases were refined with density modification using SOLOMON (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh173c20">20</xref>).

To test the importance of these base-specific interactions in SeqA<sub>71&#x02013;181</sub> binding, we performed a comprehensive mutational study on a 14mer DNA with the hemimethylated G-<sup>m</sup>A-T-C sequence (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh173f1">1</xref>A). First, we studied the G4:C4&#x0002a; base pair, in which the G4 base interacts with Asn150 in the crystal structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh173c13">13</xref>). As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh173f1">1</xref>B, replacements of the G4:C4&#x0002a; base pair by A:T, T:A and C:G moderately reduced the DNA binding ability, although detectable amounts (40&#x02013;60&#x00025; of that of the wild-type sequence) of the complexes were still formed. Therefore, the G4:C4&#x0002a; base pair contributes somewhat to the specific binding. Next, the T6:A6&#x0002a; base pair, which is methylated in the fully methylated state but not in the hemimethylated state, was examined. In the crystal structure, the T6 base hydrogen-bonds with Asn152 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh173c13">13</xref>). When the T6:A6&#x0002a; base pair was replaced by A6:T6&#x0002a;, the DNA binding was significantly decreased (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh173f1">1</xref>C, lane 4). The replacements of the T6:A6&#x0002a; base pair by G6:C6&#x0002a; and C6:G6&#x0002a; also decreased the SeqA binding. Thus, the T6:A6&#x0002a; base pair contributes to the specific binding, as indicated by the crystal structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh173c13">13</xref>). Interestingly, the C7:G7&#x0002a; base pair has no base-specific interactions in the crystal structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh173c13">13</xref>). Consistent with this observation, the replacements of the C7:G7&#x0002a; base pair by A:T and T:A did not cause a significant decrease in the SeqA<sub>71&#x02013;181</sub> DNA binding (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh173f1">1</xref>D, lanes 4 and 5). However, the replacement by the G:C base pair significantly reduced the SeqA<sub>71&#x02013;181</sub> DNA binding (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh173f1">1</xref>D, lane 3). Therefore, the C7:G7&#x0002a; base pair functions to eliminate sequences containing G:C at this position, in some indirect way. Further analyses will be required to elucidate how this base pair replacement affects the hemimethylated DNA binding by SeqA.</p><p>In the crystal structure, the propeller angle of the thymine base, which is the pairing partner of the <italic>N</italic><sup>6</sup>-methyladenine, is significantly distorted by a base-specific hydrogen bond between the O4 of T5&#x0002a; and the side chain of Asn150 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh173c13">13</xref>). In the present study, the T5&#x0002a; base of the A5:T5&#x0002a; base pair, but not A5, was replaced by adenine or cytosine (A5:A5&#x0002a; and A5:C5&#x0002a;, respectively), so that the hydrogen bond with Asn150 was disrupted. These mismatched mutations abolished the SeqA<sub>71&#x02013;181</sub> binding (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh173f1">1</xref>E, lanes 4 and 5). Thus, the T5&#x0002a; residue is crucial for the specific DNA binding. Surprisingly, the replacement of A5:T5&#x0002a; with A5:G5&#x0002a; did not affect the specific DNA binding (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh173f1">1</xref>E, lane 3). This implied that Asn150 formed a hydrogen bond with the O6 of G5&#x0002a;, in place of the O4 of T5&#x0002a;.</p></sec><sec><title>Structure of the SeqA<sub>71&#x02013;181</sub>-hemimethylated T5&#x0002a;G DNA complex</title><p>To study the molecular mechanism of SeqA binding to hemimethylated DNA with the mismatched A5:G5&#x0002a; base pair, we determined the crystal structure of SeqA<sub>71&#x02013;181</sub> complexed with a 10mer hemimethylated T5&#x0002a;G DNA containing the G-<sup>m</sup>A(:G)-T-C sequence (the SeqA<sub>71&#x02013;181</sub>&#x000b7;T5&#x0002a;G complex; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh173f2">2</xref>A) at 2.5 &#x0212b; resolution (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh173f2">2</xref>).

The N6-methyl group of A5 is specifically recognized by two van der Waals contacts, with the main chain CO group of Thr151 and the main chain NH group of Asn152, which are the same as those of the normal hemimethylated DNA &#x0005b;Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh173f3">3</xref>; Guarne <italic>et al</italic>.

In the SeqA<sub>71&#x02013;181</sub>&#x000b7;10mer complex, the T5&#x0002a; distortion places the O4 atom of T5&#x0002a; in close enough proximity to form a hydrogen bond with the &#x003b4;NH<sub>2</sub> group of Asn150 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh173f3">3</xref>C), indicating that the distortion is essential for the base-specific recognition by SeqA. The propeller angle of the mismatched G5&#x0002a; base in the hemimethylated T5&#x0002a;G DNA is also distorted in the SeqA<sub>71&#x02013;181</sub>&#x000b7;T5&#x0002a;G complex, like the case of T5&#x0002a; in the SeqA<sub>71&#x02013;181</sub>&#x000b7;10mer complex (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh173f4">4</xref>B and D). This G5&#x0002a; distortion actually allows the O6 of G5&#x0002a; to form a hydrogen bond with Asn150 (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh173f3">3</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh173f4">4</xref>D). Therefore, these results indicate that the base distortion and the hydrogen bonding with the base, which pairs with the methyladenine, are essential for the hemimethylated G-<sup>m</sup>A-T-C recognition by SeqA.</p></sec><sec><title>Recognition of the unmethylated T6:A6&#x0002a; base pair, which is methylated only in the fully methylated state</title><p>Previous structural analyses revealed the mechanism for the N6-methyl group recognition by SeqA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh173c13">13</xref>), but the mechanism of SeqA discrimination between hemimethylated DNA and fully methylated DNA has not been determined. In the present study, we found an electron density near A6&#x0002a;, which is methylated only in the fully methylated state (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh173f5">5</xref>A). This electron density near A6&#x0002a; was not observed in the previous structural analysis with the SeqA<sub>51&#x02013;181</sub>&#x000b7;12mer complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh173c13">13</xref>). This electron density could be due to either a water molecule or a metal ion, such as sodium, since sodium was used in the crystallization. Although we cannot exclude the possibility that the electron density is due to a sodium ion, we prefer the explanation that it is due to a water molecule, for the following reasons. (i) The electron density is located in a position where it can form hydrogen bonds with the main chain CO group of Asn150 and the N7 of A6&#x0002a; with an angle of 102&#x000b0;, which is close to the favored angle for these bonds (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh173f3">3</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh173f5">5</xref>A). (ii) When the <sup>m</sup>A5:T5&#x0002a; and T6:A6&#x0002a; base pairs of the SeqA<sub>71&#x02013;181</sub>&#x000b7;10mer complex (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh173f5">5</xref>B, red) were superimposed on those of the SeqA<sub>51&#x02013;181</sub>&#x000b7;12mer complex (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh173f5">5</xref>B, blue), the <sup>m</sup>A5:T5&#x0002a; base pair overlapped well. However, the A6&#x0002a; base, which may directly interact with the atom in the electron density, did not overlap with the corresponding base of the SeqA<sub>51&#x02013;181</sub>&#x000b7;12mer complex (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh173f5">5</xref>B). This difference in the A6&#x0002a; base may be due to the water-mediated hydrogen bonding, which is found in the SeqA<sub>71&#x02013;181</sub>&#x000b7;10mer complex but not in the SeqA<sub>51&#x02013;181</sub>&#x000b7;12mer complex. (iii) The <italic>B</italic>-factor of this atom is low (19.78 &#x0212b;<sup>2</sup>), indicating its stable binding to the SeqA&#x000b7;DNA complex. These results support the idea that the electron density is due to a water molecule. However, the lengths of these water-mediated hydrogen bonds are shorter (2.4 and 2.5 &#x0212b;) than a regular hydrogen bond (about 2.8 &#x0212b;) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh173f5">5</xref>A and C). The strong binding of the water molecule to the SeqA&#x000b7;DNA complex may shorten the lengths of the hydrogen bonds.</p><p>If the electron density is due to a salt ion, then the hemimethylated DNA binding of SeqA could be affected by the salt concentration and species. Therefore, we next tested the hemimethylated DNA binding of SeqA<sub>71&#x02013;181</sub> with different salt concentrations (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh173f6">6</xref>A and B) and species (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh173f6">6</xref>C&#x02013;G). SeqA<sub>71&#x02013;181</sub> specifically bound to the hemimethylated DNA, but not to the unmethylated or fully methylated DNAs, in the presence of 300 mM NaCl (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh173f6">6</xref>A). The specific SeqA<sub>71&#x02013;181</sub> binding to hemimethylated DNA was not affected when the NaCl concentration was reduced to 30 mM (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh173f6">6</xref>B). In addition, SeqA<sub>71&#x02013;181</sub> specifically bound to the hemimethylated DNA when NaCl was replaced by KCl, Li<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, MgSO<sub>4</sub> or MgCl<sub>2</sub> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh173f6">6</xref>C&#x02013;F). These results confirm that salt ions do not affect the hemimethylated DNA binding of SeqA. Therefore, the electron density that interacts with the main chain CO group of Asn150 and the N7 of A6&#x0002a; may not be a salt ion, but a water molecule.</p><p>If the electron density near Asn150 and A6&#x0002a; is due to a water molecule, then it is bound in the major groove side of the T6:A6&#x0002a; base pair, through two hydrogen bonds with the main chain CO group of Asn150 and the N7 of A6&#x0002a; (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh173f3">3</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh173f5">5</xref>A). This T6:A6&#x0002a; base pair is methylated in the fully methylated state, but not in the hemimethylated state. Interestingly, when a methyl group is modeled onto the N7 position of A6&#x0002a;, the van der Waals radius of the A6&#x0002a; methyl group overlaps with that of the water molecule (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh173f5">5</xref>B and C). Thus, the water molecule would be excluded due to steric hindrance with the additional methyl group of A6&#x0002a; in the fully methylated state, and the water-mediated hydrogen bonds would be destroyed. Therefore, we suggest that the water-mediated hydrogen bonds, which can be formed only in the hemimethylated state (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh173f5">5</xref>B), may be the key mechanism for the discrimination against the fully methylated state (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh173f5">5</xref>C).</p></sec><sec><title>The L3 loop</title><p>The hemimethylated <sup>m</sup>A:T pair of the DNA associates with the L3 loop, which is composed of five conserved amino acid residues (Ile148&#x02013;Thr149&#x02013;Asn150&#x02013;Thr151&#x02013;Asn152, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh173f2">2</xref>B). The L3 loop is characteristically stretched between &#x003b2;2 and &#x003b1;6, and lies co-planarly with the hemimethylated base pair on the major groove side in both the SeqA<sub>71&#x02013;181</sub>&#x000b7;T5&#x0002a;G and SeqA<sub>71&#x02013;181</sub>&#x000b7;10mer complexes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh173f2">2</xref>C and D). The N6-methyl group of A5 is specifically recognized by two van der Waals contacts with the main chain CO group of Thr151 and the main chain NH group of Asn152; both residues are located in the L3 loop (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh173f2">2</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh173f3">3</xref>). As expected, the T151A mutant (Thr151 to Ala) retained the ability to recognize the hemimethylated DNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh173f7">7</xref>, lane 15), indicating that the main chain atoms, but not the side chain atoms, of Thr151 are actually involved in the recognition of the N6-methyl group of A5 in the hemimethylated DNA. However, as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh173f7">7</xref> (lane 15), the DNA binding ability of the T151A mutant was reduced to about 40&#x00025; of that of the wild-type SeqA<sub>71&#x02013;181</sub> protein. Thr151 formed two intramolecular hydrogen bonds, with Thr149 and Lys156 (data not shown). The alanine mutations of Thr149 (T149A) and Lys156 (K156A) also caused significant deficiencies in the DNA binding (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh173f7">7</xref>, lanes 10 and 21), indicating that the defective DNA binding of the T149A and K156A mutants could be due to a perturbation of the intramolecular interaction with Thr151. These intramolecular interactions maintain the stretched structure of the L3 loop, and may be important for precisely placing the L3 loop in the major groove to form the van der Waals contacts with the methyl group of A5.</p></sec><sec><title>Amino acid residues involved in the base-specific recognition</title><p>In addition to hydrogen bonding with the O4 of T5&#x0002a;, the &#x003b4;NH<sub>2</sub> group of Asn150 also hydrogen-bonds with the O6 of G4 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh173f8">8</xref>A). When Asn150 was replaced by alanine (N150A) or aspartic acid (N150D), which should disrupt both hydrogen bonds with T5&#x0002a; and G4, the hemimethylated DNA binding ability was significantly decreased (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh173f7">7</xref>, lanes 11 and 12). Consistent with the observations in the crystal structures, these results indicate that the &#x003b4;NH<sub>2</sub> group of Asn150 significantly contributes to the base-specific DNA binding by SeqA. Interestingly, the mutations of Asn150 to lysine (N150K) and glutamine (N150Q) also caused deficiencies in the hemimethylated DNA binding, but &#x0223c;40&#x00025; of the complexes were formed, as compared with that of the wild-type SeqA<sub>71&#x02013;181</sub> protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh173f7">7</xref>, lanes 13 and 14). The lysine and glutamine mutations may retain some of the hydrogen bonds formed by Asn150.</p><p>In the T6:A6&#x0002a; base pair, the O4 of T6 forms a hydrogen bond with the &#x003b4;NH<sub>2</sub> group of Asn152 (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh173f3">3</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh173f8">8</xref>A). When Asn152 was replaced by aspartic acid (N152D), the SeqA<sub>71&#x02013;181</sub> DNA binding ability was almost completely abolished (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh173f7">7</xref>, lane 17). The mutation of Asn152 to alanine (N152A) also caused a significant reduction in the DNA binding (&#x0223c;25&#x00025; of that of the wild-type SeqA<sub>71&#x02013;181</sub> protein) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh173f7">7</xref>, lane 16). Therefore, the hydrogen bond between T6 and the Asn152 side chain is important in the specific DNA binding by SeqA. However, the N152K and N152Q mutants (Asn152 to lysine and glutamine, respectively) retain &#x0223c;75 and 50&#x00025; (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh173f7">7</xref>, lanes 18 and 19), respectively, of the hemimethylated DNA binding abilities, and the complex with the N152K mutant showed unusually slower migration (lane 18). These polar residues may mimic the hydrogen bond formed by Asn152.</p></sec><sec><title>Interactions between SeqA<sub>71&#x02013;181</sub> and the 5&#x02032;-phosphate groups of G8&#x0002a;, G7&#x0002a; and A6&#x0002a;</title><p>The SeqA<sub>71&#x02013;181</sub>-bound DNA molecule is globally distorted; the minor groove is significantly narrower than that of B-form DNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh173f8">8</xref>B). The 5&#x02032;-phosphate groups of G8&#x0002a;, G7&#x0002a; and A6&#x0002a; in the unmethylated strand strongly interact with the amino acid residues from the L1, L2 and &#x003b1;6 regions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh173f8">8</xref>A). To test the importance of these interactions, we performed alanine scanning mutagenesis in the L1, L2 and &#x003b1;6 regions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh173f7">7</xref>). The alanine mutations of Arg116 and Arg118 (R116A and R118A, respectively) in the L1 loop significantly reduced the hemimethylated DNA binding (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh173f7">7</xref>, lanes 3 and 5), whereas the alanine mutation of Thr117 (T117A) only slightly affected the DNA binding (lane 4). Consistently, in the present SeqA<sub>71&#x02013;181</sub>&#x000b7;10mer complex structure, the main chain NH group of Arg116 interacts with the G7&#x0002a; phosphate group, and the aliphatic part of the Arg116 side chain forms a van der Waals contact with the deoxyribose moiety of G8&#x0002a; (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh173f8">8</xref>A). Furthermore, the &#x003b5;N of Arg118 electrostatically interacts with the A6&#x0002a; phosphate group, in addition to its interactions with the main chain NH group and the G7&#x0002a; phosphate group (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh173f8">8</xref>A). In &#x003b1;6, Arg155, which interacts with the G8&#x0002a; phosphate group (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh173f8">8</xref>A), also contributes to the DNA binding, because the R155A mutant (Arg155 to alanine) was significantly defective in this function (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh173f7">7</xref>, lane 20). These essential interactions with the backbone phosphate groups of the unmethylated strand may be important for the distorted DNA structure found in the SeqA<sub>71&#x02013;181</sub>&#x000b7;DNA complex (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh173f8">8</xref>B).</p><p>As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh173f7">7</xref>, the N133A, Q134A, T135A and K136A mutants in the L2 loop each caused either no decrease or only a slight decrease in the DNA binding ability (lanes 6&#x02013;9), although the side chain NH<sub>2</sub> group of Arg133 interacts with the phosphate group of A6&#x0002a; in the SeqA<sub>71&#x02013;181</sub>&#x000b7;10mer structure (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh173f8">8</xref>A). Therefore, in contrast to the L1 loop, the amino acid residues in the L2 loop do not seem to be essential for the DNA binding by SeqA.

These MTases, which are components of the bacterial restriction&#x02013;modification systems, sequence specifically bind to their target DNA, and flip out the cytosine or adenine base from the DNA helix.

The small methyl-binding surface of SeqA may be suitable for recognizing only one methyl group, but not two methyl groups in both strands.</p><p>In the present study, we have determined the molecular mechanism of the hemimethylated DNA recognition by SeqA, and have suggested a mechanism for its exclusion of fully methylated DNA. The unique structure of the hemimethylated G-<sup>m</sup>A-T-C sequence and the mechanism of its recognition by SeqA provide important insights into how SeqA specifically recognizes the hemimethylated G-<sup>m</sup>A-T-C sequences among over 19 000 fully methylated G-A-T-C sites in the <italic>E.coli</italic> chromosome, without affecting other methylation-dependent processes, such as mismatch repair and restriction&#x02013;modification systems.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkh173f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> SeqA<sub>71&#x02013;181</sub>&#x02013;DNA binding analyses.
