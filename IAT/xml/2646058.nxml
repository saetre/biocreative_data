In the past decade, considerable evidence has accumulated implicating oxidative stress as a key factor that accelerates the onset and progression of type 2 diabetes. Chronic oxidative stress causes inflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction and culminates in insulin resistance, which ultimately progresses to diabetes. Oxidative stress also promotes cellular dysfunction and damage, leading to the development of secondary complications of diabetes. The underlying cause of redox imbalance is a deficiency in the endogenous antioxidant network. This deficiency would result in an inability to combat excessive amounts of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and tip the balance in favor of oxidative stress.</p><p>Redox balance is maintained by an antioxidant defense network within mitochondria, consisting of stress-responsive enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase and reduced glutathione (GSH), and antioxidants. The antioxidant defense network is activated in response to excessive production of ROS in the mitochondria, thereby neutralizing the ROS before they inflict damage on cellular molecules. Lipoic acid is a potent mitochondrial antioxidant that plays a central role in establishing and maintaining the antioxidant defense network by effectively scavenging ROS and regenerating critical antioxidants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>). Lipoic acid is also an essential cofactor of mitochondrial enzyme complexes involved in oxidative metabolism. Exogenous lipoic acid, by virtue of its antioxidant effect, has been shown to be beneficial in many metabolic and vascular diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>). Endogenously, lipoic acid is synthesized from octanoic acid by the action of LASY. Previously, synthesis of lipoic acid was believed to be an exclusively prokaryotic phenomenon, and existence of LASY in higher organisms was unknown. The discovery that mammalian cells are capable of synthesizing lipoic acid was made quite recently, when a mouse homolog of LASY was identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>). Mammalian LASY contains a putative mitochondria targeting sequence at the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminus and is mainly localized in mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>). Thus, LASY is ideally positioned to generate lipoic acid at the site of action, namely, mitochondria. Although the pharmacological effects of lipoic acid have been explored in many studies, the importance of endogenous lipoic acid is largely unknown. In this study, we explored the role of LASY in diabetes and inflammation. Our data show for the first time that LASY is downregulated in diabetes and inflammation. Downregulation of LASY resulted in decreased endogenous lipoic acid levels. The data that we have presented suggest that downregulation of LASY, and the resultant decrease in endogenous lipoic acid, would cause redox imbalance leading to inflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction, two important hallmarks of diabetes.</p><sec><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Reagents.</title><p>Unless otherwise stated, reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO).</p></sec><sec><title>Rodents, diets, and housing.</title><p>Rodents for in vivo studies were purchased from Jackson or Charles River Laboratories.

Skeletal muscle and adipose tissue are key players that contribute to insulin resistance in type 2 diabetes. LASY gene expression is significantly downregulated in both skeletal muscle (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.02) and adipose tissue (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.004) of <italic>db</italic>/<italic>db</italic> mice compared with their normoglycemic heterozygous (<italic>db</italic>/&#x0002b;) counterparts and normal control mice (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref>). Interestingly, there was no decrease in LASY mRNA levels in the liver of <italic>db/db</italic> mice compared with the <italic>db/&#x0002b;</italic> or nondiabetic mice. There was a small increase that was insignificant. Downregulation of LASY in adipose tissue of <italic>db/db</italic> mice translated to a significant decrease in endogenous lipoic acid levels (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>C</italic></xref>). The anti&#x02013;lipoic acid antibodies used in the blot detected lipoic acid bound to the E2 subunits of PDC and &#x003b1;-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (KDH), two key mitochondrial enzymes that use lipoic acid as a cofactor (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.007, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.005, for lipoic acid&#x02013;PDC-E2 and lipoic acid&#x02013;KDH-E2, respectively) compared with <italic>db/&#x0002b;</italic> mice (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>C</italic></xref>). This suggests that in diabetic mice such as <italic>db/db</italic>, decrease in LASY results in a decrease in endogenous lipoic acid levels. We also studied LASY mRNA levels in adipose tissue from two other animal models of obesity, the <italic>ob</italic>/<italic>ob</italic> mouse model and Zucker <italic>fa</italic>/<italic>fa</italic> rat model. As seen in the case of the <italic>db</italic>/<italic>db</italic> mice, LASY expression was significantly reduced in these obese models compared with their lean counterparts (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>B</italic></xref>, <italic>ob</italic>/<italic>ob</italic>, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001, Zucker <italic>fa</italic>/<italic>fa</italic>, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.03).</p></sec><sec><title>LASY expression in vitro is downregulated by conditions that exist in diabetes.</title><p>Hyperglycemia and increased secretion of inflammatory cytokines are two hallmarks of diabetes. To understand the regulation of LASY, HMVECs were subjected to treatment with medium containing TNF-&#x003b1; or high glucose (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Treatment with glucose (25 mmol/l) led to a significant downregulation (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.02) in LASY mRNA levels in endothelial cells. Intermediary levels of glucose (11 mmol/l) or an osmotic control (<sc>d</sc>-mannitol) did not significantly affect LASY expression (Supplementary Fig. 1, found in the online appendix). Treatment of HSMMs with 25 mmol/l glucose also reduced LASY mRNA levels significantly (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.02). Treatment of both endothelial cells and skeletal muscle cells with TNF-&#x003b1; significantly decreased LASY mRNA levels (<xref rid="f2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). Thus, consistent with the animal data, which suggests reduction in LASY in diabetes, LASY appears to be susceptible to downregulation by hyperglycemia and inflammatory cytokines.</p></sec><sec><title>Inhibition of LASY expression decreases mitochondrial lipoic acid levels.</title><p>We knocked down the LASY gene in HSMMs using the siRNA-based gene silencing approach. Using this approach, we were able to get 51&#x00025; knockdown of the LASY gene after 48 h (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>A</italic></xref>). As shown in <xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>B</italic></xref>, the knockdown was specific to LASY, since expression of a housekeeping gene such as GAPDH was not affected. Consistent with the real-time PCR data, knockdown of LASY resulted in a significant reduction in LASY protein levels (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>C</italic></xref>, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.009). We then studied the effect of LASY knockdown on endogenous lipoic acid levels by using Western blot analysis. As shown in <xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>D</italic></xref>, knockdown of LASY resulted in a significant decrease in lipoic acid that is associated with PDC and KDH (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01). However, knockdown of LASY did not affect total levels of E2 protein (<xref rid="f3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>E</italic></xref>). Thus, knockdown of LASY directly translates to a decrease in lipoic acid associated with the E2 subunit of PDC, without affecting levels of E2 protein. These results are consistent with our in vivo results in which downregulation of LASY in tissues translated to a decrease in lipoic acid levels (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>C</italic></xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Knockdown of LASY decreases intracellular GSH levels in human skeletal muscle cells.</title><p>The antioxidant properties of lipoic acid facilitate the regeneration of other antioxidants such as reduced GSH, which in turn protects cells from oxidative damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>). We hypothesized that reduction in the levels of lipoic acid due to LASY knockdown would result in a decrease in intracellular GSH levels. We studied the GSH levels in HSMMs in response to LASY knockdown. Compared with the control siRNA oligo, there was a significant decrease (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.005) in GSH levels in cells treated with LASY siRNA (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>A</italic></xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Knockdown of LASY results in decreased activities of superoxide dismutase and catalase and increased superoxide anion levels.</title><p>To further investigate the effect of LASY knockdown on the cellular antioxidant defense network, we determined the activities of two critical antioxidant enzymes, CAT and SOD, in HSMMs after knockdown of LASY. As shown in <xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>, knockdown of LASY results in a significant decrease in the activities of catalase (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>B</italic></xref>) and mitochondrial and cytosolic SOD (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>C</italic></xref> and <italic>D</italic>). Treatment with 500 &#x003bc;mol/l lipoic acid restored the activities of these enzymes (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>B&#x02013;D</italic></xref>). There was a concentration-dependent effect between 100 and 500 &#x003bc;mol/l of lipoic acid. Based on the decrease in SOD activity, we hypothesized that there would be an increase in superoxide anion levels with LASY knockdown. This turned out to be true, since there was a significant increase in superoxide anion levels both in basal and TNF-&#x003b1;&#x02013;treated conditions (<xref rid="f4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>E</italic></xref>). Treatment with lipoic acid (500 &#x003bc;mol/l) did not decrease the superoxide anion levels. Instead, there was a significant increase in superoxide anion levels with lipoic acid treatment in both control and LASY siRNA-treated samples, compared with the TNF-&#x003b1;&#x02013;treated levels. The difference between control and LASY siRNA-treated samples was also significant, suggesting that lipoic acid treatment worsens the TNF-&#x003b1;&#x02013;induced accumulation of superoxide when LASY is deficient.</p></sec><sec><title>Reduced LASY expression results in decreased glucose uptake in skeletal muscle cells.</title><p>One of the factors contributing to hyperglycemia is insulin resistance, which causes reduced glucose uptake by skeletal muscle. Based on our observation that LASY expression is downregulated in the skeletal muscle of insulin-resistant animals, we studied the effect of reduced LASY expression on glucose uptake in skeletal muscle cells. We knocked down the LASY gene by siRNA-based gene silencing and studied the effect of the knockdown on &#x0005b;<sup>3</sup>H&#x0005d;-2-deoxy glucose uptake in skeletal muscle cells. As in our earlier experiments, we obtained a substantial knockdown (64&#x00025;) with the LASY siRNA oligo compared with the control siRNA oligo in HSMM cells (data not shown). Decreased LASY expression in skeletal muscle cells significantly reduced insulin-stimulated glucose uptake (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>A</italic></xref>) (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01). There was a small, insignificant decrease in basal glucose uptake (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>A</italic></xref>). These data demonstrate that downregulation of LASY has a contributory role on insulin resistance in skeletal muscle.</p></sec><sec><title>Reduced LASY expression decreases mitochondrial membrane potential in human skeletal muscle cells.</title><p>Because a decline in mitochondrial function is one of the causes of insulin resistance in diabetes, we tested if a decrease in LASY would affect mitochondrial function. We studied the effect of siRNA-based knockdown of LASY on mitochondrial membrane potential. Mitochondrial membrane potential was measured in terms of the ratio of red to green fluorescence of a cationic dye, JC-1 (see <sc>research design and methods</sc>). Reduced LASY expression was accompanied by a significant decrease (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.003) in the ratio of red to green fluorescence of JC-1 dye, indicating that LASY knockdown affects mitochondrial membrane potential (<xref rid="f5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>B</italic></xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Inhibition of LASY exacerbates inflammation.</title><p>Increase in inflammation and consequent endothelial cell dysfunction, which are two other hallmarks of diabetes, play a contributory role in atherosclerosis. We tested if knocking down the LASY gene would affect the inflammatory response in endothelial cells. Using the RNAi approach, we were able to get 88&#x00025; knockdown of LASY in HMVECs (<xref rid="f6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>A</italic></xref>, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). Concomitant with LASY reduction, basal secretion of MCP-1 in HMVECs with reduced expression of LASY was significantly increased (<xref rid="f6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>B</italic></xref>, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). Treatment with TNF-&#x003b1; further elevated the levels of MCP-1 (<xref rid="f6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>B</italic></xref>, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.02). These data demonstrate an inverse relationship between LASY expression levels and secretion of MCP-1, suggesting that inhibition of LASY expression increases inflammation.</p></sec><sec><title>Inhibition of LASY expression increases nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-&#x003ba;B.</title><p>Nuclear factor (NF)-&#x003ba;B is a key transcription factor that is involved in the transcription of over 150 known genes, including genes encoding inflammatory markers such as MCP-1. Translocation of NF-&#x003ba;B into the nucleus is a key event in the activation of NF-&#x003ba;B. We investigated if inhibition of LASY has an effect on TNF-&#x003b1;&#x02013;induced nuclear translocation of the p65 subunit of NF-&#x003ba;B. Western blot analysis of nuclear extracts showed that siRNA-based knockdown of LASY increased nuclear translocation of the NF-&#x003ba;B p65 subunit compared with the control after 8 h of treatment with TNF (<xref rid="f6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>C</italic></xref>, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.002). Nuclear levels of NF-&#x003ba;B p65 subunit decreased after 18 h of TNF treatment, with no significant differences between control and LASY at this time point (<xref rid="f6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>C</italic></xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Overexpression of LASY alleviates the inflammatory response.</title><p>We next studied the effect of overexpressing LASY in endothelial cells, to confirm that LASY does indeed protect cells against inflammatory insults. The LASY gene was cloned into pBK-CMV, so that its expression was under the control of the strong cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter. The resulting construct (pBKCMV-LASY) was transfected into HMVECs, and the transfected cells were treated with proinflammatory agents such as TNF-&#x003b1; or AGE. LASY mRNA levels were increased approximately threefold in cells transfected with pBKCMV-LASY compared with mock (pBKCMV)-transfected cells (<xref rid="f7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7<italic>A</italic></xref>). Cells that overexpressed LASY showed a significant decrease in TNF-&#x003b1;&#x02013;stimulated secretion of MCP-1 compared with mock-transfected cells (<xref rid="f7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7<italic>B</italic></xref>, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01). AGEs generated by hyperglycemia are implicated in the development of inflammation and atherosclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>). We looked at the effect of AGE treatment on MCP-1 levels in cells that overexpressed LASY. As seen with TNF-&#x003b1; treatment, LASY overexpression caused a significant decrease in AGE-induced secretion of MCP-1 (<xref rid="f7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7<italic>B</italic></xref>, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.005). These results suggest that increased expression of LASY alleviates inflammation.</p></sec><sec><title>Treatment with &#x003b1;-lipoic acid increases LASY expression and has beneficial effects on inflammation and mitochondrial membrane potential.</title><p>Real-time PCR studies revealed that treatment of cells with lipoic acid (500 &#x003bc;mol/l) upregulates LASY expression by &#x0223c;3.5-fold (<xref rid="f8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8<italic>A</italic></xref>, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.003). Lower concentrations of lipoic acid (100 &#x003bc;mol/l) did not increase LASY expression.

Downregulation of LASY in leptin/leptin receptor&#x02013;deficient models could be a secondary effect of hyperglycemia and increased cytokine expression in these models. Our in vitro data demonstrate that treatment of endothelial and skeletal muscle cells with high glucose and TNF-&#x003b1; decreases LASY expression. Data from our in vitro gene silencing studies reveal that knockdown of LASY has detrimental effects on various aspects of cellular function. One of them is the disruption of the antioxidant defense system. We have shown that knockdown of LASY results in a significant decrease in the activities of two critical antioxidant enzymes, SOD and CAT, which are involved in maintaining intracellular redox balance. Deficiency of LASY reduced activities of both mitochondrial and cytosolic SOD. The net effect of reduction in SOD and CAT activities would be increased accumulation of reactive species such as superoxide anion, a highly reactive species that would have been normally detoxified by SOD and CAT in a sequential manner to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and water. This hypothesis turned out to be true, since there was a significant increase in the intracellular superoxide anions under basal and TNF-&#x003b1;&#x02013;treated conditions after LASY knockdown. Thus, downregulation of LASY results in an overall disturbance in the antioxidant defense network, tipping the balance toward oxidative stress. Treatment with exogenous lipoic acid restored the activities of SOD and catalase but was unable to reduce the superoxide anion levels. In our experiment, we saw a significant increase in superoxide anion levels with lipoic acid treatment in both the control and LASY siRNA-treated samples in response to TNF-&#x003b1; treatment. This may be due to the pro-oxidant activity of lipoic acid that has been reported in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>). Disturbance in the endogenous antioxidant network is reflected in decreased GSH levels, suggesting inability to regenerate reduced glutathione. Our in vitro data showing that knockdown of LASY results in decreased GSH levels is consistent with published literature. A significant decrease in erythrocyte GSH levels has been reported in mice that are heterozygous for disruption of the LASY gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>).</p><p>Accumulation of excessive amounts of ROS such as superoxide anion could directly inflict damage on cellular macromolecules. Because mitochondria are a major site of ROS generation, accumulated ROS could cause damage to the mitochondrial membrane, resulting in its inability to maintain a gradient. This could then lead to mitochondrial dysfunction. The decrease in mitochondrial membrane potential that we have demonstrated in our in vitro LASY knockdown studies could be a result of damage caused by ROS. In addition, accumulated ROS can activate inflammatory pathways such as the NF-&#x003ba;B pathway, which can lead to increased expression of inflammatory cytokines. We found that LASY knockdown in endothelial cells increases TNF-&#x003b1;&#x02013;induced NF-&#x003ba;B translocation into the nucleus. Our data suggest that knockdown of LASY and the consequent accumulation of ROS triggers the activation of NF-&#x003ba;B, resulting in increased expression of NF-&#x003ba;B&#x02013;regulated inflammatory genes such as MCP-1. Increase in circulating inflammatory cytokines and mitochondrial dysfunction contribute to insulin resistance, which could account for the decrease in glucose uptake in skeletal muscle after knockdown of LASY. It has been suggested that accumulation of ROS could be interpreted by the cell as an imbalance between substrate availability and oxidative capacity to which decreased insulin signaling (and thus decreased glucose uptake) would be an appropriate response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>). Decreased insulin signaling due to ROS has been attributed to decreased levels of phosphorylated Akt accompanied by an increase in phosphorylated JNK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>).</p><p>Increased secretion of inflammatory cytokines, mitochondrial dysfunction, and decreased glucose uptake after LASY knockdown could all contribute to further deterioration of hyperglycemia and associated metabolic abnormalities in animal models of diabetes and obesity. In <italic>db/db</italic>, <italic>fa/fa</italic>, and <italic>ob/ob</italic> models, which are already deficient in leptin signaling, deficiency in LASY would therefore accelerate progression of disease.</p><p>Downregulation of LASY is not a phenomenon restricted to animal models of diabetes. We studied blood samples from human subjects with type 2 diabetes for LASY expression by real-time PCR. These studies revealed significant downregulation of the LASY gene in subjects with diabetes compared with age- and sex-matched healthy individuals (data not shown).</p><p>Our studies demonstrate that deficiency of LASY results in a decrease in mitochondrial lipoic acid levels. Using antibodies that recognize protein-bound lipoic acid, we have shown that knockdown of LASY reduces lipoic acid associated with two key enzyme complexes, namely PDC and KDH. Thus, deficiency of LASY directly affects levels of lipoic acid within the mitochondria. The correlation between LASY expression and mitochondrial lipoic acid is also evident in the adipose tissue of <italic>db/db</italic> mice, where deficiency of LASY results in a decrease in levels of lipoic acid (<xref rid="f1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>C</italic></xref>).</p><p>Reduced mitochondrial lipoic acid levels due to LASY deficiency could be the predominant cause of the disturbances in the antioxidant defense system manifested as reduced SOD and CAT activities, increased superoxide anion levels, and decreased intracellular GSH. Because endogenous lipoic acid is a potent antioxidant, it is conceivable that a decrease in endogenous lipoic acid could cause perturbations in the endogenous antioxidant system. Supplementation with exogenous lipoic acid was able to completely restore SOD and CAT activities in a dose-dependent manner. This suggests that exogenously administered lipoic acid can compensate for the deficiency of LASY. Interestingly, our data show that exogenously administered lipoic acid increases the expression of LASY (at 500 &#x003bc;mol/l), suggesting that exogenously administered lipoic acid promotes its own generation. Thus, some of the known beneficial effects of lipoic acid administration could be attributed to an indirect effect of endogenous lipoic acid generation by increasing LASY levels.</p><p>Although lipoic acid is a critical cofactor of PDC, knockdown of LASY did not appear to have an immediate effect on the phosphorylation state of PDC, which is inversely related to its activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>) (Supplementary Fig. 3). The lack of effect of LASY deficiency on PDC activity is in agreement with the data from in vivo LASY knockdown studies in which PDC activity was reported to be normal in the livers from <italic>Lias</italic><sup>&#x0002b;/</sup><sup>&#x02212;</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>). Conceivably, because of the critical function of PDC in glucose metabolism, there are compensatory mechanisms that ensure that PDC activity is not affected by lipoic acid deficiency. However, it is possible that deficiency of lipoic acid may affect other enzymes/pathways that we have not included in this study.</p><p>In conclusion, our data identify a novel role for LASY in inflammation, insulin resistance, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Our data demonstrate that LASY plays a critical role in the maintenance of the endogenous antioxidant defense network, deficiency of which can aggravate the metabolic abnormalities associated with type 2 diabetes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Online-Only Appendix</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="db08-0473_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword" xlink:href="db08-0473_db08-0473[1].suppl.doc"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>No potential conflicts of interest relevant to this article were reported.</p><p>We thank Dr. Angela Vines for her assistance with real-time PCR of diabetic tissues.
