Previous studies of this yeast indicated that the Tsa1 peroxiredoxin is required for optimal growth in low zinc because of its role in degrading H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. In this report, we assessed the importance of other antioxidant genes to zinc-limited growth. Our <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">results</xref> indicated that the cytosolic superoxide dismutase Sod1 is also critical for growth under zinc-limiting conditions. We also found that Ccs1, the copper-delivering chaperone required for Sod1 activity is essential for optimal zinc-limited growth. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of the important roles these proteins play under this condition. It has been proposed previously that a loss of Sod1 activity due to inefficient metallation is one source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) under zinc-limiting conditions. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that both the level and activity of Sod1 is diminished in zinc-deficient cells. However, under conditions in which Sod1 was overexpressed in zinc-limited cells and activity was restored, we observed no decrease in ROS levels. Thus, these data indicate that while Sod1 activity is critical for low zinc growth, diminished Sod1 activity is not a major source of the elevated ROS observed under these conditions.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Zinc is an essential nutrient because it is a required structural or catalytic cofactor for many proteins. These proteins include zinc finger-containing transcription factors and enzymes such as carbonic anhydrase, alcohol dehydrogenase, and Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase. Excess zinc can also be toxic to cells. Zinc toxicity may be due to the binding of zinc to inappropriate sites that inhibit enzyme function or by displacing other metal ions from the active sites of enzymes. Thus, mechanisms of zinc homeostasis are required to maintain intracellular zinc levels within a narrow optimal range.</p><p>Both extremes of zinc status, i.e. excess and deficiency, cause oxidative stress in cells through the increased accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as superoxide anion, hydrogen peroxide, and hydroxyl radical <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007061-Hao1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007061-Powell1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

The mechanisms underlying the increased oxidative stress that occurs in zinc deficiency are much less clear.

These include thioredoxin-dependent peroxiredoxins, superoxide dismutases, glutathione peroxidases, and catalases. These proteins play different roles in metabolizing ROS depending on the specific form of ROS on which they act, the compartment in which they are targeted, and how their expression or activity is regulated in response to oxidative stress and other environmental signals. We recently showed that yeast, like other organisms, has elevated ROS when grown under zinc-limiting conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007061-Wu1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. We also found that these cells increase expression of the major cytosolic peroxiredoxin, Tsa1, to eliminate at least some of that increased ROS. Tsa1 degrades H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and this gene is critical for the growth of zinc-limited yeast. Moreover, <italic>TSA1</italic> gene expression is induced in zinc-limited cells by the action of the Zap1 transcription factor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007061-Wu1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007061-Wu2">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Zap1 up-regulates expression of plasma membrane and organellar zinc transporters to maintain zinc homeostasis and induces expression of other genes, such as <italic>TSA1</italic>, to help cells adapt to the stresses that accompany zinc deficiency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007061-Eide1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In this report, we describe a search for other antioxidant systems that are important for growth under zinc-limiting conditions. As a result, we have discovered that the activity of cytosolic Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase, encoded by the <italic>SOD1</italic> gene, is also critical for zinc-limited growth. Sod1's copper chaperone Ccs1 is also required for zinc-limited growth consistent with its role in activating Sod1. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of the critical role of Cu/Zn-SOD and its copper chaperone in zinc deficiency. Coupled with previous studies showing Sod1 is required for tolerance of high zinc <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007061-Wei1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, our results show that Sod1 is required for growth at both extremes of zinc status.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Yeast strains, plasmid and growth conditions</title><p>Yeast cells were grown in YPD (YP medium &#x0002b; 2&#x00025; glucose) and in synthetic defined SD medium with 2&#x00025; glucose and any necessary auxotrophic requirements.

These results raised the question of whether Tsa1 was uniquely important in this role or whether other antioxidant genes were also important for low zinc growth. To address this question, we assessed the growth of strains mutated for 28 different antioxidant genes for growth in low and high zinc. Wild type cells and deletion mutants were inoculated into high (LZM &#x0002b; 1000 &#x000b5;M ZnCl<sub>2</sub>) and low zinc (LZM &#x0002b; 1 &#x000b5;M ZnCl<sub>2</sub>) liquid medium at low initial cell density and cultured for 48 h prior to measuring the cell densities of the cultures. The tested genes involved in thioredoxin-dependent antioxidant pathways encode five peroxiredoxins (<italic>TSA1, TSA2, AHP1, PRX1, DOT5</italic>), thioredoxins (<italic>TRX1-3</italic>), thioredoxin reductase (<italic>TRR2</italic>) and sulfiredoxin (<italic>SRX1</italic>). Of these, only <italic>TSA1</italic> was required for low zinc growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007061-g001"><bold>Fig. 1A</bold></xref>). A second major group of antioxidants are the glutathione-dependent systems. The genes tested from this group encoded glutathione peroxidases (<italic>GPX1-3</italic>), glutathione reductase (<italic>GLR1</italic>), glutathione S-transferases (<italic>GTT1-2</italic>), and glutaredoxins (<italic>GRX1-3</italic>). None of these genes were required for low zinc growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007061-g001"><bold>Fig. 1B</bold></xref>). Additional antioxidant systems include superoxide dismutases (<italic>SOD1</italic>, <italic>SOD2</italic>), catalases (<italic>CTT1</italic>, <italic>CTA1</italic>), and cytochrome c peroxidase (<italic>CCP1</italic>). Of these, only the <italic>sod1&#x00394;</italic> mutant showed a strong growth defect in low zinc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007061-g001"><bold>Fig. 1C</bold></xref>). Unlike the <italic>tsa1&#x00394;</italic> mutant, which grew as well as wild type cells in high zinc, the <italic>sod1&#x00394;</italic> mutant showed reduced growth (&#x0223c;60&#x00025; of wild type).

To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of the essential role that Sod1 plays in supporting zinc-limited growth.</p><p>It was previously found that Sod1 is also required for resistance to high zinc <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007061-Wei1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, Sod1 is required at both extremes of zinc status. Intriguingly, despite the fact that high zinc induces oxidative stress, the contribution of Sod1 to zinc tolerance is not dependent on its SOD activity and therefore does not involve Sod1's antioxidant role. A zinc binding but catalytically inactive Sod1 allele, Sod1<sup>H46C</sup>, conferred wild type zinc tolerance on a <italic>sod1&#x00394;</italic> mutant strain while an active, Mn-binding SOD did not <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007061-Wei1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. These observations led to the hypothesis that Sod1 serves as a &#x0201c;zinc sink&#x0201d; and, by binding zinc in the cell, helps buffer cytosolic zinc and thereby contributes to zinc tolerance. It has been estimated that there are &#x0223c;500,000 molecules of Sod1 protein per cell under zinc-replete conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007061-Ghaemmaghami1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref> so the amount of zinc that is bound by this one protein is substantial. These observations initially suggested to us that Sod1 may be playing a similar role in low zinc by serving as a zinc reservoir and supplying zinc to other proteins under those conditions. However, our results indicate that Sod1 enzymatic activity is required in low zinc suggesting that it is needed to metabolize increased levels of superoxide anion that accumulate in these cells. The source of ROS in low zinc is still unknown and this is an issue we are currently addressing. Our results indicate that decreased Sod1 activity is not the primary source. Other possible sources under investigation include mitochondrial dysfunction and/or ER stress.</p><p>Sod1 and the Tsa1 peroxiredoxin are both critical for low zinc growth. Sod1 converts O<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup> into H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (and O<sub>2</sub>) while Tsal metabolizes H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> into H<sub>2</sub>O. Thus, it is conceivable that these two proteins function primarily in a sequential manner with Sod1 generating H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and Tsa1 further reducing that oxidant. If true, this would suggest that O<sub>2</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup> is the primary form of ROS generated in zinc-limited cells. This hypothesis remains to be tested. However, our observation that the <italic>tsa1&#x00394; sod1&#x00394;</italic> double mutant has elevated ROS when compared to either single mutant suggests that these proteins are not functioning solely in a sequential fashion. It is intriguing that substantially higher amounts of zinc in the growth medium are required to suppress the <italic>sod1&#x00394;</italic> mutant than the <italic>tsa1&#x00394;</italic> mutant; the low zinc growth defect of the <italic>tsa1&#x00394;</italic> mutant was suppressed by as little as 10 &#x000b5;M added zinc <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007061-Wu1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref> while the <italic>sod1&#x00394;</italic> mutant required greater than 10-fold more zinc for suppression. While the mechanism underlying this difference is unknown, it clearly shows that Sod1 is needed for optimal cell growth during even modest zinc limitation while Tsa1 is only required under the most severely zinc-deficient conditions.</p><p>We noted that Sod1 activity is decreased by about 50&#x00025; in zinc-limited cells. Protein levels also decreased to a similar extent despite no change in mRNA levels. These results suggest that if Sod1 fails to acquire its zinc cofactor soon after translation, the protein is degraded. While the mechanism of Sod1 turnover in yeast has not been studied, both proteasomal and autophagic degradation of SOD has been observed in mammalian cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007061-Hoffman1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007061-Kabuta1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. Fifty percent of Sod1 molecules represent &#x0223c;250,000 atoms of zinc. The minimum number of total zinc atoms per yeast cell required for growth is &#x0223c;5&#x000d7;10<sup>6</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007061-Gitan1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, decreased Sod1 accumulation represents a considerable decrease (&#x0223c;5&#x00025;) in the total zinc demand of the cell.</p><p>Our findings may have important relevance with regard to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a fatal neurodegenerative disorder in humans. ALS is characterized by the progressive loss of motor neurons due to cell death. Approximately 10&#x00025; of ALS cases are inherited and a subset of these are caused by dominant mutations in human Cu/Zn-SOD. While the mechanism of neuronal cell death in both heritable and spontaneous cases of ALS is not known, there is a consensus that it results from the accumulation of toxic SOD protein aggregates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007061-Hart1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007061-Culotta2">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>.

For example, it has been shown that zinc inhibits the aggregation of both wild type and ALS mutant SOD in vitro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007061-Furukawa1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007061-Banci1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, some ALS-causing mutations reduce the affinity of the SOD protein for its zinc cofactor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007061-Crow1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>.

Finally, high dietary zinc was found to improve survival in a mouse model of heritable ALS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007061-Ermilova1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. Formation of the toxic SOD aggregates is also thought to be favored by increased oxidative stress due to the formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007061-Furukawa2">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007061-Deng1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007061-Furukawa3">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, nutritional zinc deficiency may play a role in the etiology of ALS for two reasons. First, decreased zinc availability will reduce the amount of the metal ion available for binding to the zinc site. Several studies demonstrate decreased SOD activity in zinc-deficient mammalian cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007061-Taysi1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007061-Sun1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>. Second, the increased oxidative stress associated with zinc deficiency could potentially increase the likelihood of aggregate formation.</p><p>Finally, aside from <italic>TSA1</italic> and <italic>SOD1</italic>, we did not identify any other antioxidant genes that are as important for low zinc growth. Genes playing little if any apparent role include those encoding the four other peroxiredoxins, <italic>TSA2</italic>, <italic>AHP1</italic>, <italic>PRX1</italic>, and <italic>DOT5</italic>. In addition, we found no major role for <italic>CTT1</italic>, which encodes the cytosolic isozyme of catalase.

No major roles were found for the glutathione peroxidases nor for transcription factors <italic>YAP1</italic>, <italic>SKN7</italic>, <italic>MSN2</italic>, and <italic>MSN4</italic> that are normally involved in oxidative stress responses. This result is consistent with our observation that the targets of these transcription factors are not induced in zinc-limited cells despite the increased oxidative stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007061-Wu2">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007061-Lyons1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>. The level of oxidative stress in zinc deficiency may be insufficient to cause a response by these factors or, alternatively, their activity may be impaired under these conditions. One important caveat to these observations is that our analysis would not have detected small effects on growth rates that might have been caused by these mutations and, therefore, small but important contributions could have been missed. In addition, because we only analyzed strains carrying single mutations, we would not have identified genes that contribute to low zinc growth but are redundant with other genes. Thus, the full repertoire of genes required for tolerance of the oxidative stress of zinc deficiency remains to be defined.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank Dr. Joan Valentine for
