A previous study established that full gene transactivation is associated with a ternary complex consisting of two p51 bound to the two EBS on the promoter. p42, only able to bind one of the two EBS, induces only very weak activity. Here, we investigate the mechanism by which the Stromelysin-1 promoter discriminates between p51 and p42. The differential stoichiometry of the two Ets-1 isoforms arises from the Stromelysin-1 EBS palindrome. The ternary complex requires the presence of two inhibitory domains flanking the DNA-binding domain and the ability to form an intramolecular autoinhibition module. Most importantly, the p51-ternary and the p42-binary complexes induce DNA curvatures with opposite orientations. These results establish that differential DNA bending, via p51 and p42 differential binding, is correlated with the Stromelysin-1 promoter activation process.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Ets-1 is the founding member of the E26 transforming specific (ETS) family of transcription factors characterized by a conserved DNA-binding domain (DBD), called the ETS domain. The DBD recognizes specific DNA elements called ETS-binding sites (EBS), that include the consensus 5&#x02032;-GGAA/T-3&#x02032; core motif present in the promoter of target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). By binding to these elements, Ets-1 activates the transcription of several genes implicated in various processes such as development, angiogenesis, tumor invasion and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). However, the mechanism of Ets-1-mediated transcriptional activation is not completely understood. The current model involves only interactions with co-activators that induce histone acetylation and allow contacts with components of the basal transcription machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>).</p><p>Among the gene promoters requiring Ets-1, the Stromelysin-1 (matrix metalloproteinase-3 or MMP-3) promoter is particularly relevant from a biological point of view. Stromelysin-1 is a matrix metalloproteinase involved in remodeling the extracellular matrix during certain physiological and pathological processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Increased coexpression of both Ets-1 and Stromelysin-1 genes has been reported in rheumatoid arthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>), glomerulonephritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>), angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>) and tumor invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>).</p><p>Ets-1 binds to the Stromelysin-1 promoter at two head-to-head GGAA core motifs (i.e. the EBS) separated by four base pairs, the whole segment being palindromic. This palindrome is required for basal expression and for phorbol-12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA)- and interleukin-1&#x003b2; (IL-1&#x003b2;)-induced expression of the gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Furthermore, our previous work demonstrated that the binding of Ets-1 to this EBS palindrome is essential for activating the Stromelysin-1 promoter and inducing protein expression in the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>).</p><p>The human protein Ets-1 physiologically exists in two isoforms: p51, the full-length isoform, and p42, a shorter isoform lacking exon VII due to alternative splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). The lower DNA-binding activity of p51 compared to that of p42 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>) is most likely the consequence of the p51 allosteric mechanism of autoinhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). In absence of the cognate DNA, the two inhibitory domains of p51 (the N-terminal-inhibitory domain, encoded by the exon VII and the C-terminal inhibitory domain) cooperatively interact to form an inhibitory module (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). The structure of this module, determined by NMR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>) and X-ray (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>), shows that four structurally coupled inhibitory helices, HI-1, HI-2, H4 and H5, pack intramolecularly with each other and with the helix H1 of the DBD. However, this assembly has only limited stability, and changes between conformational states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). These characteristics facilitate the structural reorganization of Ets-1 upon DNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>), the optimization of the DNA/DBD interface involving a shift of the HI-2/H1 region and the unfolding of HI-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). This non-trivial rearrangement is specific to p51; p42 lacks the N-terminal-inhibitory domain and therefore the inhibitory module.</p><p>Interactions with protein partners that counteract the autoinhibition mechanism allow p51 to increase its DNA-binding affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). We established that p51 can act as its own partner when bound to the palindromic EBS in the Stromelysin-1 promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Thus, p51&#x02013;p51 cooperative interaction allows the formation of a ternary p51&#x02013;DNA&#x02013;p51 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). However, p42 only forms a binary p42&#x02013;DNA complex despite the presence of two EBS. This intriguing difference of binding stoichiometry between p51 and p42 is of special interest since it correlates with distinct transcriptional activities on the Stromelysin-1 promoter: p51 induces full transactivation of the promoter, whereas p42 is much less efficient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>).</p><p>Here, we investigated the mechanistic and structural bases of the differential DNA-binding stoichiometry of p51 and p42 on the EBS palindrome, given its crucial role in the transcriptional control of Stromelysin-1. The role of the target DNA sequence and of the Ets-1 N-terminal and C-terminal-inhibitory domains was explored, by mutating both DNA and proteins. The structural DNA distortions induced upon the complexation of p51 and p42 were characterized. Overall, the results suggest a mechanism that accounts for the differential DNA-binding stoichiometry of p51 and p42. Furthermore, we propose that Stromelysin-1 promoter activation is correlated with the isoform-induced orientation of DNA bending.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Luciferase-reporter gene</title><p>The Stromelysin-1 reporter plasmid pGL3 (Promega) constructs containing the wild-type (WT) EBS, or mutant forms M1, M2, M1M2 and inverted palindrome (IP) have been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>).

Conversely, the DNA curvature induced by p51 ternary complex is directed away from the protein&#x02013;DNA interface, compressing the DNA major groove (major groove bending) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>E).</p><p>The DNA bending observed in p42-WT is in agreement with the binary complex structures [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>), PDB code 1K79, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>), PDB codes 2STT and 2STW], which revealed a noticeable DNA minor groove curvature induced by p51&#x00394;N331. Conversely, DNA bending observed here with the p51&#x02013;WT&#x02013;p51 complex does not correspond to its crystallographic counterpart, two p51&#x00394;280&#x02013;436 proteins bound to WT [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>), PDB code 2NNY]. In this symmetric ternary complex, the minor groove curvature detected for the EBS core motif in the X-ray binary complex disappeared and the EBS palindrome was globally straight, contrary to our results. However, this X-ray ternary complex also raises another problem concerning protein homo-dimerization. In 2NNY, the dimerization of p51&#x00394;280&#x02013;436 proteins was ensured by patches of amino acids belonging to the N-terminal-inhibitory region adjacent to the DBD (amino acids 379&#x02013;382) and the DBD itself (amino acids 327&#x02013;335), with the most crucial contacts involving amino acids 332&#x02013;335 and 379&#x02013;382. The C-terminal-inhibitory region was not involved either in the protein&#x02013;protein or in the DNA&#x02013;protein interfaces. The first intriguing point is that p42 and p51&#x00394;N331 both contain the key amino acids 332&#x02013;335 and 379&#x02013;382; however, they do not form any observable ternary complexes with WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1 F2">Figures 1</xref>C and 2B). We could nevertheless hypothesize that the 331&#x02013;335 loop adopts a shape conducive to the protein&#x02013;protein interface owing to a fold involving the outermost N-terminal region. For instance, the X-ray structures of Ets-1 dimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>), as well as 2NNY, show that, in this part of the protein, the pairs of amino acids 332&#x02013;327, 343&#x02013;323 and 346&#x02013;321 are hydrogen bonded. However, the second point that is more difficult to explain is that 2NNY cannot account for the incapacity of p51&#x00394;C415 and p51(301&#x02013;415) to form a ternary complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C and D). If the N-terminal-inhibitory region and the DBD were sufficient to stabilize the ternary complex, these mutants should have been able to dimerize in the presence of WT. Discrepancies between solid-state and solution data may be due to the complex&#x02013;complex contacts generated by the crystal lattice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). In 2NNY, the ternary complexes were in fact associated in pairs, the structural unit forming a hexameric assemblage. This particular crystal packing mobilized the 308&#x02013;322 section of the N-terminal-inhibitory regions and consequently prohibited any interaction between the N- and C-terminal domains, as our results suggest. Given that our migration patterns ruled out any durable complex-complex interaction, we thus hypothesize that lattice packing modifies the ternary complex structure so that it cannot be directly extrapolated to interactions that occur in solution.</p><p>To further examine the role of the N- and C-terminal domains in the sharp DNA curvature induced by p51, we addressed the necessity of a pre-existing inhibitory module in the interaction process.</p></sec><sec><title>Role of the inhibitory module in ternary complex formation and in Stromelysin-1 promoter transactivation</title><p>Tyrosine 424 is crucial for the formation of the p51-inhibitory module (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A). Indeed, a single mutation of this tyrosine to alanine in p51 disrupts DNA-binding autoinhibition due to the unfolding of the HI-1 helix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>).

This binary complex was also observed with WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B, lane 3), the ternary complex only being detected with WT + 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B, lane 4). Using the approach detailed above to measure DNA bending, we found that the patterns obtained with p51Y424A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>C and D) exactly parallel those obtained with p42 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B and D). Both proteins induced the same curvature in terms of both amplitude and direction (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5 F6">Figures 5</xref>E and 6E). Finally, the Stromelysin-1 promoter activity associated with p51Y424A was similar to activity obtained with p42 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>F). Moreover, these results emphasize the problem posed by the 2NNY X-ray structure that fails to explain the absence of observable p51Y424A&#x02013;WT&#x02013;p51Y424A ternary complex in our experiments since this mutant contains all the amino acids belonging to the X-ray Ets1-Ets1 interface.</p><p>Therefore, the inability of p51Y424A to reproduce the properties of p51 with WT implies that the integrity of the inhibitory module of p51 is required to form the ternary complex. The results confirm the correlation between binding stoichiometry, induced DNA bend orientation and transactivation of the Stromelysin-1 promoter.</p></sec><sec><title>Steric protein hindrances on WT and DNA curvature</title><p>To better understand why the binding of two p42 was prevented with WT and not with IP and WT + 4, modeling investigations were undertaken. Given the results described above, we chose to investigate the capacity of DBD in generating ternary complexes using a very simple rigid body approach where only steric clashes could be detected. We focused on the DBD because its structure, identical across the available X-ray (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>) and NMR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>) structures, is not controversial and widely accepted. In contrast, the N-terminal region of the 2NNY ternary complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>) is likely to suffer from crystallographic artifacts, as explained above. Several structures of the N-terminal are available but they correspond to Ets-1/Ets-1 or Pax/Ets-1/DNA complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>) and are not relevant in the context of Ets-1/DNA/Ets-1 interactions. Thus, we constructed models based on the X-ray structure of the binary complex [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>), PDB code 1K79]. The protein is p51&#x00394;N331. The DNA structures consisted of 1K79 EBS core motifs bent towards the minor groove and straight B-canonical spacers. Despite their simplicity, the models gave a good estimate of the relative position of the DBD linked to the C-terminal domain and their steric hindrance.</p><p>With the WT configuration, two DBD bind in the two successive major grooves on the same DNA face and strongly overlap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A). The C-terminal domains do not participate in the steric hindrances because they are far from each other. The N-terminal-inhibitory regions, absent in our model, would increase the area of the steric hindrance zone, the N-terminal DBD parts being face-to-face and tightly tangled. It is clear that this ternary complex cannot exist without drastically distorting the DNA molecule. <fig id="F7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p>Model of p51&#x00394;N331&#x02013;DNA&#x02013;p51&#x00394;N331 ternary complex.

In this model, the N-terminal and C-terminal regions, while rather far from each other, remain face-to-face. These relative positions could allow for some level of cooperativity between two p51 molecules, leading to small amount of active ternary complexes and in agreement with the experimental data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B and D). Changing the relative orientation of the two EBS and keeping the 4 bp spacer intact (IP) corresponds to a configuration that also comfortably supports two proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>C). The two DBD are now located on opposite sides of the DNA and, in addition, the N-terminal and C-terminal regions are not in position to interact. This disposition allows p42 to form ternary complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C). However, the minor, observable amount of p51&#x02013;IP&#x02013;p51 observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B cannot be explained by the model. Since the related transactivation activity associated with p51&#x02013;IP&#x02013;p51 was not detectable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D), this ternary complex may differ from the native one. In any case, further investigations are needed to fully comprehend the nature of this ternary complex.</p><p>We then investigated how the WT spacer reacts to constraints that push the two EBS core motifs away and what sort of distortions are needed to remove the steric hindrances between two DBD. This strategy was successfully used to account for the DNA deformations induced by the TATA box-binding protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>).</p><p>The progressive distance constraints applied between the two EBS geometrical centers moved away from the EBS, generating an under-twisting and a major groove curvature on the spacer (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>). Systematic dockings of two p51&#x00394;N331 proteins extracted from 1K79 on these constrained DNA models showed that a total under-twisting of around 20&#x000b0; associated with a major groove curvature of 42&#x000b0; were the minimal changes required to circumvent DBD clashes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>).

They help understand why both IP and WT + 4 are able to form ternary complexes with p51 and p42 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B and C). The fact that, in contrast to IP, WT + 4 seemed able to accommodate an interface between two neighboring proteins could account for Stromelysin-1 transactivations, which were substantial with WT + 4 but negligible with IP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D). Concerning the curvature, its cost, around 15 kcal mol<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> for a bending magnitude of 42&#x000b0; (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>), is as low or lower than the lowest deformation energies calculated on DNA extracted from 71 X-ray complexes using the same modeling program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). This modest energetic cost should be easily compensated by the gain resulting from the homo-dimerization of the two neighboring proteins.</p><p>The nature of the intermolecular protein-protein interface cannot be deduced from our investigations and requires further experiments in conjunction with sophisticated modeling. The extended conformation of the N-terminal-inhibitory region observed in the X-ray ternary complex appears unrelated to the assembly mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). Nevertheless, active participation of this N-terminal-inhibitory region seems more than likely. Indeed, <sup>15</sup>N relaxation and hydrogen exchange NMR measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>) demonstrated that the inhibitory module consists of a stable scaffold made up of the H1, H4 and H5 helices and a mobile N-terminal-inhibitory region subject to conformational equilibria. The binding to DNA is accompanied by drastic changes in the inhibitory module. Without completely obliterating the inhibitory module folding, the N-terminal-inhibitory domain unpacks through the unfolding of HI-1, inducing a global sliding motion that results in the optimal fit between H1 and the DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). Given that the ternary complex requires the amino acid residues 333 and 334 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>) close to H1, and a complete, intact and functional-inhibitory module, this kind of N-terminal-inhibitory domain rearrangement guided by the C-terminal region acting as a scaffold, is a good candidate for overriding the autoinhibition mechanism and, at the same time, mediating the p51&#x02013;p51 interface within the ternary complex.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion|conclusions"><title>DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION</title><p>The main aim of this work was to better understand the differential DNA-binding stoichiometry of the two human Ets-1 isoforms p51 and p42 on the EBS palindrome found in the Stromelysin-1 promoter. Indeed, the formation of a ternary complex with p51 and a binary complex with p42 allows for distinctive controls of Stromelysin-1 promoter activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>), the full transactivation being associated with p51.</p><p>We first summarize the key results presented in this work. The configuration of the Stromelysin-1 EBS palindrome is crucial for generating either ternary complexes with p51 or binary complexes with p42. Changes in the orientation of the two EBS core motifs or in spacer length cancel the differences between the two Ets-1 isoforms. Indeed, these types of EBS variants form ternary complexes regardless of the Ets-1 isoform, but do not result in efficient transactivation. Operational ternary complexes require both the N-terminal and C-terminal-inhibitory domains that also require a complete, intact and functional-inhibitory module. Deleting one or both inhibitory domains or preventing the formation of the inhibitory module, only generated binary complexes. This implies that the two inhibitory regions of Ets-1 are intimately, structurally as well as functionally, coupled to binding to the Stromelysin-1 EBS palindrome. Lastly, the functional ternary complex induces noticeable DNA major groove curvature, whereas the binary complex bends the DNA in the opposite direction.</p><p>These experimental results associated with modeling investigations made it possible to reveal the mechanism that underlies the formation of p42 binary and p51 ternary complexes on the WT EBS palindrome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>). Our simulations showed that the formation of a binary complex prohibited the binding of a second protein because of severe clashes between two neighboring DBD, aggravated by the N-terminal regions. Inverting the respective orientation of the two EBS, increasing the spacer length or generating a curvature towards the major groove on the EBS palindrome center avoided the DBD steric hindrance, in agreement with the experimental results. Furthermore, our experimental data demonstrated that the cooperative binding of a second p51 on the EBS palindrome occurred via the simultaneous creation of a major groove DNA curvature and a p51&#x02013;p51 interaction. Most likely, the intermolecular protein-protein interface corresponds to drastic structural rearrangements of the inhibitory module primarily implicating the N-terminal inhibitory domains, mimicking and amplifying the displacement detected in the formation of the binary complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). The strict prerequisite of the presence of two, interacting C- and N-terminal inhibitory domains explains why p42, lacking the N-terminal inhibitory domain, does not form a ternary complex. <fig id="F8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><p>Model for the differential regulation of the Stromelysin-1 promoter by p51 and p42 Ets-1 isoforms. The binding of one p42 molecule on the EBS palindrome (core consensus motifs in green) induced DNA minor groove bending. Two p42 molecules are unable to bind the EBS palindrome due to steric clashes between the two DBD domains (DBD, in blue). In contrast, two p51 are able to overcome these steric hindrances through a cooperative interaction leading to (i) a drastic rearrangement of the inhibitory module (CtID, red diamond and NtID, red trapezoid) and the creation of an intermolecular interface between the N-terminal inhibitory domains (NtID, red trapezoid) (ii) the induction of major DNA bending (opposite to the protein&#x02013;DNA interface). This ternary complex, via the induced specific DNA curvature, is responsible for the full transactivation of the promoter.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkp307f8"/></fig></p><p>In addition, our results strongly suggest that the different capacities of p51 and p42 for activating the Stromelysin-1 promoter were associated with the induced DNA bending. p51 induces a bend directed away from the protein&#x02013;DNA interface and fully transactivates the Stromelysin-1 promoter, while p42 generates an opposite bend and activates the promoter only weakly. The p42-induced DNA curvature detected in this work has previously been established at the molecular level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). Precise characterization of p51&#x02013;induced DNA curvature requires further investigations using techniques specifically dedicated to bending measurements. However, the global coherency of our results, together with their reproducibility, indicates that p51 and p42 produce different DNA distortions, most likely related to the curvature direction.</p><p>This relationship between DNA bending and transcription activation has only been reported for Thyroid Receptor (TR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>) and the Sox2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>) systems. However, DNA bending is associated with a large number of eukaryotic-transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). In particular, many pairs of homo- or heterodimers induce DNA curvatures of opposite orientation (Fos-Jun/Jun-Jun (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>), Myc-Myc/Max-Max (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>), and TR-TR/TR-Retinoid X receptor dimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>)). In addition, we found other similar palindromic EBS (i.e. two core motifs separated by 4 base pairs) in various promoter data banks (data not shown). We recently showed that Ets-1 behaves identically with the EBS palindromes of the human p53 and Stromelysin-1 promoters, in terms of both cooperative binding and transcriptional transactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>). Taken together, these observations suggest that the mechanism revealed in this study could be a common system used to specifically activate a repertoire of various promoters. Hence, characterizing induced DNA bending should be a prerequisite to a complete description and understanding of the subtle structural dialog between DNA and transcription factors that guarantees the fine tuning of transcription regulation.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>This work was supported by the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS).
