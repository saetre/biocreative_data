However, the role of STAT3 in the intestinal epithelium is not well understood. We demonstrate that development of colonic inflammation is associated with the induction of STAT3 activity in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs). Studies in genetically engineered mice showed that epithelial STAT3 activation in dextran sodium sulfate colitis is dependent on interleukin (IL)-22 rather than IL-6. IL-22 was secreted by colonic CD11c<sup>+</sup> cells in response to Toll-like receptor stimulation. Conditional knockout mice with an IEC-specific deletion of STAT3 activity were highly susceptible to experimental colitis, indicating that epithelial STAT3 regulates gut homeostasis. STAT3<sup>IEC-KO</sup> mice, upon induction of colitis, showed a striking defect of epithelial restitution. Gene chip analysis indicated that STAT3 regulates the cellular stress response, apoptosis, and pathways associated with wound healing in IECs. Consistently, both IL-22 and epithelial STAT3 were found to be important in wound-healing experiments in vivo. In summary, our data suggest that intestinal epithelial STAT3 activation regulates immune homeostasis in the gut by promoting IL-22&#x02013;dependent mucosal wound healing.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBDs) like Crohn&#x02019;s disease and ulcerative colitis are thought to result from a dysregulated response of the intestinal immune system to bacteria present in the commensal flora (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Strober et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Rescigno, 2008</xref>). To date, it remains unclear whether a breakdown of immune tolerance is the primary cause of these diseases or occurs downstream of an initial defect of the intestinal barrier and intestinal epithelial cells (IECs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Nenci et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Strober et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Rescigno, 2008</xref>).</p><p>STAT3 is a transcription factor activated by a variety of cytokines and growth factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chapman et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Levy and Darnell, 2002</xref>). Upon activation, STAT3 translocates to the nucleus, where it regulates genes involved in apoptosis, proliferation, migration, and survival, depending on the cell type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akira, 2000</xref>). STAT3 plays an important role in several autoimmune diseases as well as IBD, where it is activated in various cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Lovato et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Mudter et al., 2005</xref>). Strikingly, mice with a deletion of STAT3 in hematopoietic cells and particularly in macrophages develop spontaneous colitis, most likely because of the lack of negative regulation of activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Takeda et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Welte et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alonzi et al., 2004</xref>). Conversely, mice with a T cell&#x02013;specific deletion of STAT3 activity are protected from a variety of autoimmune disease models, highlighting a proinflammatory role of STAT3 in T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Liu et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, there is clear evidence for cell type&#x02013;dependent functions of STAT3 in maintaining intestinal immune homeostasis. In support of this assumption, cytokines like IL-6 that are associated with STAT3 activation are elevated in mucosal biopsies of IBD patients, and many of these cytokines have been shown to play an active role in the regulation of the inflammatory process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Atreya et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Strober et al., 2007</xref>). It is therefore tempting to speculate that during the course of the inflammatory process, IECs respond to cytokines that may regulate the epithelial barrier via STAT3. In this report, we describe by using newly generated IEC-specific STAT3-deficient mice that STAT3 signaling in the intestinal epithelium is an important regulator of mucosal wound healing and is induced by IL-22 during acute experimental colitis.</p><sec><title>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</title><sec><title>Epithelial STAT3 activity regulates intestinal inflammation</title><p>To study the regulation of intestinal epithelial STAT3 activity, we induced experimental colitis by treatment of mice with dextran sodium sulfate (DSS). Although at early time points (days 0 and 2) no significant epithelial STAT3 activity was detectable in the colon, STAT3 activity was present around day 5, as demonstrated by phosphorylated STAT3 (pSTAT3) staining of almost 80% of colonic IECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>). Colitis-associated induction of epithelial STAT3 activity was confirmed by Western blotting of epithelial cell lysates for pSTAT3 in mice with DSS-induced colitis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>). To investigate the functional role of epithelial STAT3 activation in experimental colitis, we generated mice with an IEC-specific deletion of STAT3 activity (STAT3<sup>IEC-KO</sup>). Accordingly, mice with floxed STAT3 alleles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Takeda et al., 1998</xref>) were crossbred to Villin-Cre mice expressing the Cre-recombinase specifically in IECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Madison et al., 2002</xref>). Cre-mediated deletion of STAT3 was restricted to the colon and the small intestine of STAT3<sup>IEC-KO</sup> mice, whereas other organs remained unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>). Immunohistochemistry confirmed the specific absence of STAT3 phosphorylation in epithelial cells of STAT3<sup>IEC-KO</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>). STAT3<sup>IEC-KO</sup> mice developed normally and showed no spontaneous gut pathology upon histological analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 E</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20082683/DC1">Fig. S1</ext-link>).

All mice developed colitis within 10 d, as indicated by the time-dependent weight loss. Strikingly, however, although control mice were able to control weight loss after removing the DSS at day 7, STAT3<sup>IEC-KO</sup> mice lost significantly more weight after DSS treatment even after the DSS had been removed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>). Methylene blue&#x02013;aided endoscopy of the mice at the end of the experiment revealed more pronounced tissue damage with severe epithelial erosions, disruption of the normal vessel structure, and bleeding in STAT3<sup>IEC-KO</sup> mice when compared with control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, B and C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Becker et al., 2005</xref>). These findings were confirmed by histopathological analysis of colonic cross sections, in which we found significantly diminished numbers of colonic crypts and IECs in STAT3<sup>IEC-KO</sup> mice compared with controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figs. 2, D and E</xref>). To investigate whether the lack of epithelial STAT signaling may influence epithelial turnover, we analyzed proliferation and apoptosis in mice treated with DSS. Strikingly, STAT3<sup>IEC-KO</sup> mice showed less proliferation, as indicated by fewer KI-67<sup>+</sup> IECs per crypt when compared with control animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 F</xref>).

By gene ontology analysis, we found a significant enrichment of apoptosis-related genes in the gene cluster of the most up-regulated genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref>, top). Conversely, a highly significant enrichment of genes associated with wound healing and the cellular stress response was observed in the gene cluster of the most repressed genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref>, bottom). In an independent set of experiments, quantitative PCR studies were performed using isolated IECs from DSS-treated STAT3<sup>IEC-KO</sup> and control mice.

For this purpose, mucosal biopsies were taken from the colon of live mice using an endoscopy-guided biopsy forceps, resulting in defined wounds of &#x0223c;800 &#x000b5;m in size. The healing of these wounds was then monitored for several days, and the wound size was compared between control and STAT3<sup>IEC-KO</sup> mice by endoscopical analysis. Although in wild-type mice the wounds usually healed within 6 d, wound healing was significantly delayed in STAT3<sup>IEC-KO</sup> mice and the wounds had still not closed at day 6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 C</xref>). Furthermore, immunohistochemical analysis of the wound bed in wild-type mice 2 d after taking the biopsy indicated a localized induction of IEC STAT3 activity that was clearly confined to crypts adjacent to the wound bed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 D</xref>). Strikingly, wound-associated STAT3 activity colocalized with increased epithelial proliferation, as indicated by the presence of KI-67<sup>+</sup> IECs. Thus, our data support an important function of STAT3 signaling for mucosal wound healing.</p></sec><sec><title>STAT3 is specifically induced by IL-22 released from CD11c<sup>+</sup> cells during acute experimental colitis</title><p>Depending on the target cells, STAT3 mediates signal transduction of several cytokines and proinflammatory mediators like IL-6 and IL-22 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chapman et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Levy and Darnell, 2002</xref>). Interestingly the latter two cytokines are strongly expressed in human patients with IBDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Reinecker et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brand et al., 2006</xref>). Although both cytokines were undetectable in colonic biopsies at days 0 and 2 after DSS treatment, IL-22 was significantly induced at days 5 and 7, whereas IL-6 was detected at day 7 only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref>). Next, we compared epithelial STAT3 activity in DSS-treated wild-type, IL-6<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>, and IL-22<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. Strikingly, although IL-6&#x02013;deficient mice challenged with DSS for 1 wk showed intestinal epithelial STAT3 activation indistinguishable from wild-type mice, IL-22<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice showed an almost complete lack of epithelial STAT3 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 B</xref>). This finding was confirmed by Western blotting of IEC lysates from animals after 1 wk of DSS treatment showing a lack of pSTAT3 immunoreactivity in IECs from IL-22&#x02013;deficient mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 B</xref>). In agreement with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Zheng et al., 2008</xref>), we found that both IL-22 receptor chain genes (<italic>IL-22R</italic> and <italic>IL-10R2</italic>) were strongly expressed in the small and large bowel compared with other organs (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20082683/DC1">Fig. S3</ext-link>). To provide evidence for a direct effect of IL-22 on IECs, full-thickness colon pieces from wild-type mice were cultured in the presence or absence of IL-22 and subsequently immunostained for pSTAT3. Although untreated colons did not show pSTAT3 immunoreactivity within the epithelium, treatment with IL-22 led to strong epithelial pSTAT3 staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 C</xref>, top). This finding was further confirmed by Western blotting of primary IECs cultured in the presence of IL-22 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 C</xref>, bottom). Based on our observations, we propose that IL-22, via the activation of STAT3, protects the intestinal epithelium and promotes mucosal wound healing during acute experimental colitis. In support of this model, IL-22<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice developed more severe colitis than wild-type mice, and showed a loss of mucosal architecture and a lack of IECs comparable to that seen in STAT3<sup>IEC-KO</sup> mice (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20082683/DC1">Fig. S4</ext-link>). Moreover, IL-22<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice showed delayed intestinal wound healing when compared with wild-type mice (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20082683/DC1">Fig. S5</ext-link>). Similarly, DSS-induced colitis in wild-type mice that were treated with a neutralizing antibody against IL-22 was more severe than in control-treated animals (unpublished data). Therefore, our data suggest that IL-22 is an important regulator of mucosal wound healing via STAT3 activation in IECs.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p><bold>IL-22 directs epithelial STAT3 activity in acute DSS-induced colitis.</bold> (A) IL-6 and IL-22 expression (&#x000b1;SD) in the gut of mice treated for 1 wk with DSS.

We next isolated lamina propria cells from DSS-treated wild-type mice and stimulated them with LPS, CpG, and lipoteichoic acid. IL-22 was significantly induced by all three Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands, therefore supporting a role for innate immune cell&#x02013;derived IL-22 in the regulation of epithelial STAT3 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 D</xref>). To directly identify the source of IL-22 in the lamina propria of mice with colitis, we performed immunostaining of colon cross sections from animals with established DSS colitis for CD11c and IL-22. As demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 E</xref>, CD11c<sup>+</sup> cells were enriched in the inflamed colon. Moreover, we observed a striking colocalization of CD11c and IL-22, suggesting that DCs may be an important source for IL-22 in the inflamed colon. To further confirm these findings, we sequentially purified CD11c<sup>+</sup>, CD4<sup>+</sup>, and CD11c<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD4<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cells from the lamina propria of inflamed colon tissues and cultured them for 24 h. IL-22 was present in both CD11<sup>+</sup> and CD4<sup>+</sup> cell cultures, but only little IL-22 was produced by CD4<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD11c<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 F</xref>). Furthermore, when isolated cells were immunostained for CD11c and IL-22, we observed colocalization of these markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 F</xref>, inset). To investigate whether CD11c<sup>+</sup> cell expression of IL-22 was limited to colitis, we isolated CD11c<sup>+</sup> cells from the lamina propria of healthy mice and stimulated them with CpG and IL-23, which was recently described as an inducer of IL-22 in DCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Zheng et al., 2008</xref>). Again, we found that IL-22 expression was markedly induced in lamina propria CD11c<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 G</xref>), suggesting that DCs stimulated by TLR ligands and IL-23 are an important source of IL-22 in acute colitis.</p><p>In summary, our observations provide evidence that epithelial STAT3 functions as an important regulator of tissue homeostasis in the gut. STAT3 is induced in IECs after induction of colitis or injury, and it regulates several signaling pathways that are commonly involved in wound healing. Our study furthermore provides evidence that STAT3 activation during acute colitis is critically dependent on IL-22. IL-22 has been described to be produced by activated T cells, especially by Th17 cells as well as by DCs and NK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Wolk and Sabat, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ouyang et al., 2008</xref>). Furthermore, in a very recent report, a distinct NK cell population (NKp46<sup>+</sup>) was described as an innate source of IL-22 in human and mouse lymphoid tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cella et al., 2009</xref>). In this report, we confirm that IL-22 during acute colitis is produced by cells of the innate immune system, as well as by CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. However, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells are present only in small numbers in the lamina propria during the initial acute phase of DSS-induced colitis and are largely confined to lymphoid follicles (unpublished data). In contrast, CD11c<sup>+</sup> DCs are present in significant numbers in the colon of healthy animals and are strategically located directly underneath the surface epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Rimoldi et al., 2005</xref>). Thus, activation of these DCs via TLRs either by invading pathogens or by transepithelial sampling of bacteria may promote rapid activation of the IL-22&#x02013;STAT3 axis at the intestinal epithelium. Our model is in keeping with a recent study showing that Myd88-mediated signaling through mesenchymal cells is required for the amplification of mouse colonic epithelial progenitors that occurs in response to DSS-induced injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Pull et al., 2005</xref>). However, our data do not exclude that in chronic colitis or at later stages of established colitis, IL-22 may also be significantly expressed by other inflammatory cells infiltrating the lamina propria, such as Th17 cells, or that other factors may be expressed that may also stimulate IEC STAT3 activity. Among those lines, NK cells have recently been established as producers of IL-22 and some NK cell populations express CD11c (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Zenewicz et al., 2008</xref>). Although our data confirm that cells expressing the NK cell marker DX5 can produce IL-22, little IL-22 was found in supernatants of DX5<sup>+</sup> cells isolated from the lamina propria of mice treated with DSS (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20082683/DC1">Fig. S7</ext-link>).</p><p>Our model is in agreement with previous reports suggesting that IL-22 is a central regulator of tissues in inflammatory conditions, and several studies have previously suggested a protective role for IL-22 in the regulation of gut inflammation. Accordingly, IL-22 gene delivery was shown to ameliorate DSS-induced colitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Sugimoto et al., 2008</xref>). In another study, in a model of experimental <italic>Citrobacter rodentium</italic> infection, IL-22<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice showed increased intestinal epithelial damage, along with systemic bacterial burden and significantly increased mortality, when compared with control mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Zheng et al., 2008</xref>). In this study, IL-22 induced the expression of Reg proteins, which are released by IECs and exert antimicrobial functions. This observation is in keeping with our present observation that STAT3<sup>IEC-KO</sup> mice showed greatly diminished expression of <italic>RegIII&#x003b3;</italic> and <italic>RegIII&#x003b2;</italic> in gene chip experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>), suggesting that STAT3 functions as a key regulator for the expression of these genes. IL-22&#x02013;induced STAT3 activation in the injured gut may therefore not only promote IEC proliferation and protection against apoptosis but may also serve to control bacterial growth in the lamina propria adjacent to the wound. Our data are also consistent with two very recently published studies in which IL-6/gp130-mediated STAT3 activation during tumor development was shown to drive cell proliferation of enterocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bollrath et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Grivennikov et al., 2009</xref>). In conclusion, IL-22/STAT3 signaling in IECs emerges as an important protective pathway for the mucosal immune system. STAT3 seems dispensable for gut homeostasis under steady-state conditions but is activated upon challenge to drive tissue regeneration and protection in situations of increased demand, as during colitis and injury.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title/><sec><title>Mice.</title><p>Mice with a floxed STAT3 allele were provided by S.
