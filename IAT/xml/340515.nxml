Bacteriol. 165, 94-100, 1986). The clustered inversion region consists of four DNA segments designated respectively as A, B, C and D which differ in molecular size and restriction sites. The four DNA segments invert independently or in groups resulting in a complex DNA rearrangement. We now show the nucleotide sequence of the clustered inversion region of R64. The present results suggest that the clustered inversion region is a biological switch to select one of seven open reading frames whose primary structures at the region proximal to N-termini are constant while those at the C-terminal region are variable. A name, "Shufflon" was proposed to call this kind of the clustered inversion region.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00247-0295.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1165"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00247-0296.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1166"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00247-0297.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1167"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00247-0298.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1168"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00247-0299.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1169"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00247-0300.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1170"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00247-0301.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1171"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00247-0302.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1172"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
