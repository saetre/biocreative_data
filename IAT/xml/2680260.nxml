This opportunistic pathogen is the most dominant bacterium causing chronic infections in the cystic fibrosis (CF) lung (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Lyczak <italic>et al</italic>., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">G&#x000f3;mez and Prince, 2007</xref>) and has emerged as an important causative agent of nosocomial infections, particularly in intensive care units (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b68">Trautmann <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). The first step in establishing an infection is the adherence and colonization of the epithelium, which is mediated, in part, by type IV pili (T4P) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Klausen <italic>et al</italic>., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Giltner <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). These T4P are also receptors for bacteriophages and mediate a mode of surface translocation termed twitching motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Mattick, 2002</xref>).</p><p><italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> T4P are polar organelles that are composed of a single protein subunit, PilA. The PilA subunits are first synthesized as prepilins. In the course of assembly in the periplasmic space, the leader peptide is cleaved and the resulting N-terminal residue is methylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b70">Whitchurch, 2006</xref>). The assembled pilus filament is extruded through the outer membrane via a gated channel, the multimeric PilQ secretin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Martin <italic>et al</italic>., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b75">Wolfgang <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Collins <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>). Besides the major T4P prepilin PilA, the <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> genome contains one gene cluster (PA4549&#x02013;PA4556) that encodes PilY1, PilY2 and the six minor T4P prepilins FimT, FimU, PilV, PilW, PilX and PilE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Mattick, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b70">Whitchurch, 2006</xref>). The <italic>fimU-pilVWXY1Y2E</italic> genes are cotranscribed in an operon which is under the control of the response regulator AlgR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Belete <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>).</p><p>The minor prepilins possess the canonical hydrophobic N-terminal sequence signature of prepilins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Mattick, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b70">Whitchurch, 2006</xref>). They are membrane-located and are required for pilus biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">Russell and Darzins, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Alm <italic>et al</italic>., 1996</xref>), but do not seem to be incorporated into the extracellular T4P structure. The two non-prepilin proteins that are encoded by the operon <italic>fimU-pilVWXY1Y2E,</italic> PilY1 (PA4554) and PilY2 (PA4555) are also necessary for pilus formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Alm <italic>et al</italic>., 1996</xref>). In addition, PilY1 has been reported to be involved in the control of the expression of the <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> lipase LipC (PA4813) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Mart&#x000ed;nez <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>). The PilY1 protein carries a prepilin peptidase export signal and is transported across the inner membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Lewenza <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). PilY1 of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PAO1 shares 43% homology to the C-terminal sequence of PilC2 of <italic>Neisseria meningitidis</italic> and of <italic>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</italic>. Neisserial PilC resides in the bacterial outer membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">Rahman <italic>et al</italic>., 1997</xref>) and in the pilus tip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">Rudel <italic>et al</italic>., 1995</xref>). The PilC proteins whose expression can be switched on and off by phase variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">Rytk&#x000f6;nen <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>), are major adhesins and regulate PilT-mediated T4P retraction in <italic>Neisseria</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">Morand <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>). This datum indicates that the 3.5 kb <italic>P. aeruginosa pilY1</italic> homologue may encode a protein with multiple functions including, but not restricted to, pilus biogenesis.</p><p><italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> TBCF10839 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b69">T&#x000fc;mmler <italic>et al.</italic>, 1991</xref>) is a non-piliated CF isolate that carries an out-of-frame deletion in the <italic>pilQ</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Chang <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). Hence this strain provided the opportunity to explore functions of pilus biogenesis genes that are not directly related to their essential roles in piliation. In this study the strain TBCF10839 and mutants thereof were exploited to gain knowledge about the yet unresolved function(s) of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PilY1. Besides its known roles in piliation and twitching, PilY1 was found to be involved in numerous other phenotypes, namely the secretion of phenazines and quinolines, bacterial cell lysis, virulence and mammalian host defence.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Screening of a signature tagged mutagenesis library of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> TBCF10839 in a polymorphonuclear neutrophil phagocytosis assay</title><p>Polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) are the most important mammalian host defence cells against infections with <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">D&#x000f6;ring <italic>et al</italic>., 1995</xref>). A mini-Tn<italic>5</italic> plasposon library of the CF airway isolate TBCF10839 carrying variable V<sub>40</sub> (V = A, G, C) oligonucleotide signature tags were screened for survival in freshly prepared human PMNs in phagocytosis assays. Batches of 48 mutants each carrying a different signature tag were exposed at a total multiplicity of infection of 10 to PMNs and viable bacteria were recovered after 2 h. Numerous transposon mutants were identified which survived at significant lower frequencies in the phagocytosis assays than the wild-type strain (L. Wiehlmann, in preparation). Unexpectedly, four mutants consistently showed higher survival rates than TBCF10839, suggesting that the inactivation of this gene by the insertion of a transposon increased resistance to killing by PMNs. Sequencing revealed that the transposon had inserted into two genes of yet unknown function (P. Salunkhe, in preparation) or into two different positions of the 3486 bp large pilus biogenesis gene <italic>pilY1</italic>[PA4554, positions 1617 (mutant 10CB5) or 2308 (mutant 25C8)].</p></sec><sec><title>PilY1 phenotype in a non-piliated host strain</title><p>PilY1 was identified in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> as the homologue of the gonococcal PilC which is the T4P tip-located adhesin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Alm <italic>et al</italic>., 1996</xref>). <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> strain TBCF10839, however, is non-piliated due to an out-of-frame deletion in the <italic>pilQ</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Chang <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>). The dodecameric transmembrane protein PilQ plays a central role in extruding the pilus fibre through the bacterial outer membrane and thereby facilitates the presence and functionality of extracellular pili (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b70">Whitchurch, 2006</xref>). Hence, the transposon mutants in the <italic>pilY1</italic> gene of strain TBCF10839 are double knockouts in the polycistronic operons <italic>pilMNOPQ</italic> (PA5044&#x02013;PA5040) and <italic>pilVWXY1Y2E</italic> (PA4551&#x02013;PA4556). Correspondingly, neither strain TBCF10839 nor its <italic>pilY1</italic> transposon mutants were twitching (Supporting information, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>). Complementation <italic>in trans</italic> with the functional PAO1 <italic>pilQ</italic> gene conferred twitching to TBCF10839 to levels seen in reference strain PAO1, but did not restore twitching in the <italic>pilY1</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>). Transposon insertions into the piliated and twitching-proficient PA14 strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">Rahme <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>) also led to the loss of twitching (data not shown). These findings confirm the report by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Alm <italic>et al</italic>. (1996)</xref> that a functional PilY1 protein is necessary for twitching.</p><p>As already the TBCF10839 host strain was phenotypically silent in twitching, we hypothesized that PilY1 should have further roles in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> beyond pilus-mediated motility. If this is the case, the PilY1 protein should be present in the non-piliated host. The <italic>pilY1</italic> gene of strain TBCF10839 was sequenced and highly sensitive and specific polyclonal peptide anti-PilY1 antibodies were raised against epitopes that are shared between the PilY1 orthologues of strains TBCF10839 and PAO1. PilY1-immunoreactive bands of predicted size (126 kDa) and similar intensity were detected on immunoblots of PAGE-separated cell lysates from strains PAO1 and TBCF10839 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>) suggesting that PilY1 was present in similar amounts in the piliated and the non-piliated strain. The presence of PilY1 irrespective of the status of piliation provided the first evidence for roles of the PilY1 protein other than pilus biogenesis that should be associated with susceptibility to killing by PMNs as a surrogate function.</p><fig id="fig01" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Upper panel: Immunoblot analysis of PilY1 in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> cell lysates.

A faint band of about 59 kDa was recognized by the anti-PilY1 antibody in the <italic>pilY1</italic> mutant 10CB5 with the proximal insertion at position 1617 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>). This datum shows that the insertion of a transposon in <italic>pilW</italic> upstream of <italic>pilY1</italic> in the <italic>fimU-pilVWXY1Y2E</italic> operon had a strong polar effect and caused a knockout of PilY1. Mutagenesis within <italic>pilY1</italic> itself led either to a null mutant or to a leaky mutant with minute production of truncated protein. Complementation of the null mutant <italic>in trans</italic> led to overproduction of PilY1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>).</p><p>The strong PilY1-immunoreactive signals of PAO1 and TBCF10839 cell lysates shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref> were obtained from 2 ml of culture. The corresponding extracellular protein fractions that contain secreted proteins or sheared cellular appendages like pili were immunonegative for PilY1 on blots. To improve the sensitivity, supernatants of bacterial cultures were 100-fold concentrated for proteins larger than 50 kDa by ultrafiltration and then immunoprecipitated with anti-PilY1 antibody. A PilY1 signal of predicted size of the full-length protein was still not detectable on the blots. However, an immunoreactive band of about 88 kDa was visible in the immunoprecipitate from TBCF10839 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2</xref>). The same band became apparent on blots of whole cell lysates of TBCF10839 after longer exposure with the ECL detection reagent, whereas blots derived from cell lysates of PA14 that lack the epitopes used for anti-PilY1-antibody generation, showed no signal (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2B</xref>). This datum demonstrates that the anti-PilY1 antibody recognized PilY1-specific epitopes in the 88 kDa protein. As the immunoreactive 88 kDa signal was seen neither in cell lysates of PA14 nor in the pre-immune control of the immunoprecipitations, this 88 kDa band most likely represents a shorter isoform PilY1* of strain TBCF10839. Only PilY1*, but not the full-length PilY1, was present in the extracellular protein fraction. As the PilY1*-immunoreactive signal became only visible by immunoprecipitation from concentrated supernatant, maximal 5%, but probably even less of total PilY1 resided in the extracellular fraction. No PilY1* signal was detected in the immunoblots of the TBCF10839 <italic>pilY1</italic> transposon mutant (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref> for the cell lysate and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2</xref> for the immunoprecipitate of concentrated supernatant).</p><fig id="fig02" position="float"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Immunoblot analysis of PilY1 in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> immunoprecipitates of the extracellular protein fraction that had been concentrated about a 100-fold by ultrafiltration.

The mRNA expression profile of the transposon mutant in comparison with the wild-type strains showed the significant upregulation of 20 genes and significant downregulation of 56 genes (Supporting Information, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>).

Recovery of the surviving bacteria 48 h later demonstrated that the <italic>pilW</italic> and <italic>pilY1</italic> mutants were obtained in higher yields from the infected mouse lungs than from pools of the same mutants that had been cultured in parallel in LB broth <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S9A</xref>). Competition experiments with two other sets of isogenic STM mutants showed again that the <italic>pilW</italic> and <italic>pilY1</italic> mutants had the highest fitness to persist and grow in murine airways (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S9B and C</xref>). In parallel to the higher survival of the <italic>pilY1</italic> mutant in the murine habitat, the immigration of PMNs into the lungs was evoked in the mouse. A dose of 8 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> alginate-embedded TBCF10839 bacteria or of its isogenic <italic>pilY1</italic> mutant 25C8 was instilled into murine airways. The bronchoalveolar lavage fluid collected 3 or 4 days after infection with the <italic>pilY1</italic> mutant contained higher number of white blood cells that could be attributed to the significant increase of PMNs (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig09">Fig. 9</xref>). The lack of PilY1 led to a stronger emigration of PMNs into the airways. The stronger attraction of PMNs to the infected site, however, was not associated with increased morbidity.

The beauty of the technology is an <italic>in vivo</italic> selection process done by the habitat among a mixed population of mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Levesque, 2006</xref>). STM has the potential to discover novel and unexpected targets and pathways. Such a surprising finding was the starting point of this work. Screening of a STM library in a non-piliated <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> strain uncovered that transposon inactivation of its <italic>pilY1</italic> gene rendered the bacterium more resistant against killing by PMNs than the wild type and any other of the more than 3500 tested mutants.

The prepilins are involved in export, maturation and presentation of the major fimbrial subunit, when these genes are expressed in the correct stoichiometric ratios (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Alm and Mattick, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">1997</xref>). The prepilins, but also PilY1 (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S1</xref>) are necessary to confer twitching motility. However, to date there are no reports that show the incorporation of the proteins in the T4P structure. This fits with our observation that the PilY1 protein was present in similar amounts in the piliated PAO1 and the non-piliated <italic>pilQ</italic>-defective TBCF10839 strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>).</p><p>The <italic>pilY1</italic> gene has been annotated to encode the tip-associated adhesin (Pseudomonas database <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pseudomonas.com">http://www.pseudomonas.com</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66">Stover <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>) like its homologue in <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> PilC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">Rudel <italic>et al</italic>., 1995</xref>). <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S11</xref> shows a dendrogram of the closest currently known homologues of PilY1 based on CLUSTALX protein sequence alignments. The neisserial PilC and the <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PilY1 proteins form separate branches. The substantial sequence diversity may result in different functions, and indeed no PilY1-immunoreactive signals were associated with the extracellular parts of PAO1 pili in electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">Fig. 7</xref>). Hence, the claim in the database is not supported that PilY1 in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> is a tip-associated adhesin.</p><p><italic>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</italic> PilC1 and PilC2 are multifunctional proteins in correspondence with their dual localization in cellular appendages and the bacterial outer membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">Rahman <italic>et al</italic>., 1997</xref>), i.e. they promote adhesion, piliation and transformation competence that are executed by different modules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">Morand <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>). This study demonstrates that <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PilY1 is also a multifunctional protein. First, as shown in this and previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Alm <italic>et al</italic>., 1996</xref>), PilY1 is indeed essential for piliation. Second, and this is new, PilY1 of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> is involved in the release of secondary metabolites into the extracellular space and is necessary to prevent autolysis in a bacterial colony. The latter two functions of PilY1 were observed in both piliated and non-piliated strains and hence are independent of pilus assembly.</p><p>The anti-PilY1 antibody recognized, besides the full-length PilY1, a shorter isoform PilY1*. The specificity of the PilY1* signal was corroborated by the immunonegative blots of isogenic PilY1 knockouts and of strain PA14 whose PilY1 protein does not contain the epitopes against which the antibody was raised (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S2</xref>). PilY1* was the only PilY1 isoform in immunoprecipitates of the extracellular protein fraction of TBCF10839. Hence PilY1* should be the PilY1 isoform that was visualized in the extracellular nanoparticles by immunogold electron microscopy. The particles were absent in <italic>pilY1</italic> knockout mutants which points to a functional association between PilY1* and the make-up of these structures. The PilY1 immunoprecipitates of the concentrated &#x0003e; 50 000 molecular weight extracellular fraction contained numerous hydrophobic compounds including HAQs. As these compounds have a molecular weight below 1000, they coprecipitated as polydisperse aggregates and thus most likely reflect the secondary metabolite components of the PilY1*-positive nanoparticles. Pyocyanin was completely and PQS was largely lacking from the particles. The signal molecule PQS is known to be extruded by vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Mashburn and Whiteley, 2005</xref>), but the other major HAQs are translocated by other means across the bacterial membranes. Hence we conclude that PilY1 and/or PilY1* is involved in the discharge of these secondary metabolites. The transport was accomplished by both the piliated PAO1 and the non-piliated <italic>pilQ</italic>-defective TBCF10839 strains, suggesting that this function does not require a properly elongating T4P.</p><p>PilY1 is transported to the periplasm in a Sec-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Goldberg <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>) in accordance with their presence in the membrane fraction of a cell lysate. To be released into the extracellular medium, a small portion of the PilY1 pool may be carried by the T4P all the way to the external medium or may be expelled by the brief elongation of the type II pseudopilus as it is the case of type II-dependent exoproteins. As the nanoparticles are present in the extracellular medium of piliated and non-piliated <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">Fig. 7</xref>), the latter rather than the former mechanism should account for the release of PilY1* and secondary metabolites into the extracellular space. Although we have yet no experimental evidence for this, it is tempting to assume that prior to or during this process PilY1 is cleaved to the extracellular isoform PilY1*.</p><p>Transposon insertions in TBCF10839 <italic>pilW</italic> and <italic>pilY1</italic> caused similar phenotypes. The insertions may have affected the expression of the individual genes within the <italic>fimU-pilVWXY1Y2E</italic> operon to differential extent, but with respect to PilY1 protein the <italic>pilW</italic> and <italic>pilY1</italic> mutants caused the same phenotype as judged by immunoblot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>). Both mutants were PilY1 knockouts. Likewise, macroscopic phenotypes such as the autolytic morphotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6</xref>), pyocyanin and HAQ deficiencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4</xref>) and persistence in (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S9</xref>) and inflammation of murine airways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10</xref>) were indistinguishable between the examined <italic>pilW</italic> and <italic>pilY1</italic> mutants. Subtle differences were visualized in the electron micrographs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">Fig. 7</xref>). Some extracellular PilY1* was seen in the <italic>pilW</italic> mutant at far below wild-type levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">Fig. 7J</xref>).</p><p>PA14 <italic>pilY1</italic> and TBCF10839 <italic>pilY1</italic> transposon mutants were growing to higher cell densities than their parental strains. PA14 mutants appeared colourless, but their HAQ and pyocyanin deficiencies at 37&#x000b0;C were less pronounced (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S6</xref>) than those of the TBCF10839 mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4</xref>). Interestingly, the PA14 mutants showed autolysis at 25&#x000b0;C, but not 37&#x000b0;C, whereas the TBCF10839 mutants showed autolysis at 37&#x000b0;C, but not at 42&#x000b0;C. This temperature dependence points to a delicate interplay between growth and secretion of secondary metabolites that is modulated by the genetic background with PilY1 being a major modifier to prevent cell lysis. According to our data PilY1 seems to be involved in the control of both cell density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3</xref>) and secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Figs 3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">S7</xref>). Cell density is monitored by the QS network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Juhas <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>). AHL levels were normal in the <italic>pilY1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S5</xref>) and thus signalling via the <italic>las</italic> and <italic>rhl</italic> networks probably remained unaffected in PilY1-deficient cells. The levels of PQS and pyocyanin, however, were lower in the mutants so that the PQS and PYO regulons operating in the late exponential and early stationary phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Dietrich <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>) could principally be affected in the <italic>pilY1</italic> mutants. The transcriptome, however, provided no evidence for any direct or indirect perturbation of the QS regulons in the TBCF10839 <italic>pilY1</italic> transposon mutant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S1</xref>). Hence, the inactivation of <italic>pilY1</italic> exerts its effects at the post-transcriptional level. The experimental data point to direct roles of PilY1 at the interface between cell and environment. Besides the assistance in secretion and pilus biogenesis, the annotated role of PilY1 as an adhesin may be materialized by the control of growth during stationary phase. The cell-associated PilY1 and the extracellular nanoparticle-associated PilY1* could scan cell density by scoring cell&#x02013;cell, cell&#x02013;matrix or matrix&#x02013;matrix contacts mediated by PilY1&#x02013;PilY1, PilY1&#x02013;PilY1* or PilY1*&#x02013;PilY1* interactions respectively. These contacts between PilY1/PilY1* molecules could confine the density of the stationary bacterial population. This scenario is similar to the dual roles of numerous proteins involved in territorial stability in multicellular organisms that either exist in the membrane or are processed by proteolytic cleavage and then released to become part of the extracellular matrix. The inactivation of PilY1 will lead to the observed stronger growth in stationary phase and finally autolysis at high cell densities, but on the other hand it may facilitate persistence in hostile habitats like the murine lung or lysosomal compartments of a PMN.</p><p>In the latter case, the intracellular retention of HAQs like PQS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">H&#x000e4;ussler and Becker, 2008</xref>) may help to counterbalance the oxidative stress exerted by the neutrophil. When the phagocytosed mutant cells are delivered to the phagolysosome, the lysosomal enzymes will lyse the bacterial cells. HAQs are released into the lysosomal compartment. The noxious bacterial compounds will damage the PMN and thereby impede bacterial cell killing. Consequently PilY1-defective <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> cells will survive better during a standardized PMN phagocytosis assay <italic>in vitro.</italic> On the other hand, if the toxic effect is exerted by viable bacteria via the release of pyocyanin, the eukaryotic host will be less harmed by an attack of pyocyanin-deficient PilY1 mutants. An example is the <italic>C. elegans</italic> fast-killing infection model where the secretion of pyocyanin by viable bacteria is instrumental for virulence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b67">Tan <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig08">Fig. 8</xref>).</p><p>In summary, <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PilY1 has a role in the control of cell density in the bacterial population and assists in pilus biogenesis, twitching motility and the release of secondary metabolites into the extracellular space. PilY1 shows substantial amino acid sequence diversity particularly in the N-terminal regions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Fig. S11</xref>). In conjunction with divergent genetic backgrounds, this may modulate phenotype and fitness traits of clones in the <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b72">Wiehlmann <italic>et al</italic>., 2007a</xref>).</p><p>Inactivation of <italic>pilY1</italic> in the CF isolate TBCF10839 rendered the bacterial cells more resistant to killing by PMNs and improved their persistence in murine airways. Future studies should reveal whether <italic>pilY1</italic> or the other genes in the operon are targets for mutagenesis in natural infections with <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and may confer an advantage or disadvantage in fitness to colonize and to persist in animate habitats and to breach epithelial barriers.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Experimental procedures</title><sec><title>Strains, plasmids and growth conditions</title><p>Plasmids, strains and culture conditions are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Table S2</xref>.
