Moreover, the DNAM-1&#x02013;deficient mice developed significantly more DNAM-1 ligand-expressing fibrosarcoma and papilloma cells in response to the chemical carcinogens MCA and 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA), respectively, than did WT mice.

CTL and NK cells are major players in cell-mediated immunity to tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>). Tumor recognition by and activation of CTL and NK cells are mediated by antigen receptors and a variety of adhesion and costimulatory molecules including CD2, LFA-1 (leukocyte function-associated antigen-1; CD11a/CD18), CD27, 2B4, CD28, ICOS (inducible costimulator), NKG2D, TRAIL (TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand), and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>). Interactions of these cell surface receptors with their respective ligands expressed on tumors induce cytotoxic activity of CTL and NK cells against tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>).</p><p>DNAM-1 (CD226) is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily and is expressed on the majority of NK cells, T cells, monocytes, and platelets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>). DNAM-1 constitutively associates with LFA-1 on NK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>). Ligation of LFA-1 with antibodies causes Fyn-dependent phosphorylation of tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic domain of DNAM-1, which are necessary for DNAM-1&#x02013;dependent NK cell functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>). DNAM-1 also associates with LFA-1 in activated T cells, for which the protein kinase C&#x02013;induced serine phosphorylation in the cytoplasmic domain of DNAM-1 is responsible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>), and is involved in an LFA-1&#x02013;mediated costimulatory signal for naive T cell differentiation and proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>). The poliovirus receptor (PVR) CD155 and its family member CD112 (PRR-2 [PVR-related family 2], also called nectin-2) are ligands for human and mouse DNAM-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>). Interactions between DNAM-1 on NK cells and T cells and its ligands CD112 and CD155 on tumor cells augment cell-mediated cytotoxicity and cytokine production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). Although human CD112 and CD155 are broadly distributed on epithelial and endothelial cells in many tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>), they are overexpressed on certain tumors, both nonhematopoietic and hematopoietic, including colorectal carcinomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>), gastric cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>), ovarian cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>), neuroblastomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>), myeloid leukemias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>), and multiple myeloma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>), suggesting that DNAM-1 ligand expression might be induced by tumorigenesis and, thus, stimulates CTL and NK cells. However, it remains uncertain whether DNAM-1 is involved in immune surveillance of tumors in vivo. We therefore generated KO mice lacking the <italic>Cd226</italic> (<italic>DNAM-1</italic>) gene and investigated the in vivo role of DNAM-1 in tumor immunity.</p><sec><title>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</title><sec><title>Mouse DNAM-1 mediates cytotoxic activity of CTL and NK cells</title><p>Previous studies demonstrated that the addition of human DNAM-1&#x02013;neutralizing antibodies to in vitro cytotoxicity assays inhibited CTL or NK cell&#x02013;mediated lysis of several tumor cell lines expressing DNAM-1 ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>), suggesting that human DNAM-1 is involved in CTL and NK cell&#x02013;mediated cytotoxicity. However, the role of DNAM-1 in cytotoxicity of mouse CTL and NK cells has not been investigated. To address this issue, we generated mice lacking the <italic>Cd226</italic> (<italic>DNAM-1</italic>) gene in the BALB/c background (<italic>DNAM-1</italic> KO mice; Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081611/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081611/DC1</ext-link>). Naive DNAM-1&#x02013;deficient mice showed a normal composition of lymphocyte populations in the spleen, BM, and LN (Fig. S2 and not depicted), suggesting that the disruption of <italic>Cd226</italic> did not affect lymphocyte differentiation. We then examined the expression of DNAM-1 ligands CD155 and CD112 in mouse tumor cell lines EL-4 (H-2<sup>b</sup>), RL male-1 (H-2<sup>d</sup>), and BW5147 (H-2<sup>k</sup>). These cell lines expressed comparable amounts of CD155 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). In contrast, CD112 was expressed on RMA transfectant expressing CD112 (RMA-CD112) but was barely detected on the other tumor cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). We next generated CTL by coculture of spleen cells from WT and DNAM-1&#x02013;deficient BALB/c mice (H-2<sup>d</sup>) with the RMA cell line (H-2<sup>b</sup>) and then purified CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells by sorting. Because RMA cells did not express DNAM-1 ligands (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>) and the population of CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells after the culture was comparable between WT and KO spleen cells (not depicted), DNAM-1 deficiency did not affect the induction of DNAM-1&#x02013;deficient CTL cells. The purified WT and DNAM-1&#x02013;deficient CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells specifically killed EL-4 tumor cells as well as RMA transfectant expressing CD115 (RMA-CD155), but not RL male-1 or BW5147 (H-2<sup>k</sup>) target cells, suggesting that both CTL were H-2<sup>b</sup> specific (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). However, DNAM-1&#x02013;deficient CTL were significantly less cytotoxic to RMA-CD155 and EL-4 than were the WT CTL cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>DNAM-1 is involved in NK cell&#x02013; and CTL-mediated cytotoxicity against DNAM-1 ligand&#x02013;expressing tumor cell lines.</bold> (A) Tumor cell lines or transfectants indicated were stained with anti-CD155 or anti-CD112 mAbs and analyzed by flow cytometry.

However, they showed less cytotoxicity to RMA-S&#x02013;CD155 cells than did WT NK cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, A and C</xref>).

Considering the short time interval, NK cells, rather than CTL, might be involved in the clearance of RMA-S&#x02013;CD155 cells.

To provide formal evidence for the role of DNAM-1 in protecting against DNAM-1 ligand-expressing tumors in vivo, we transplanted Meth A tumors that expressed CD155, but not CD112, into WT and DNAM-1&#x02013;deficient mice (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>).

Although <italic>CD155</italic> and <italic>CD112</italic> messenger RNAs (mRNAs) were barely detected in naive derma, MCA-induced fibrosarcoma cells expressed significant quantities of both in both groups of mice (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>).

These results suggest that DNAM-1 recognition of CD155 on fibrosarcoma cells was involved in tumor immune surveillance, which is consistent with the &#x0201c;immunoediting&#x0201d; theory in which immune responses select for variant tumor cells which have lost or decreased expression of specific molecules that are targeted by immune effector cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>). In contrast to CD155, CD112 seemed not to be involved in immunoediting. This may be explained by our previous observations that the affinities of homotypic binding of CD112 were likely to be higher than those of CD112 binding to DNAM-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>).</p><p>Recent studies using genetically engineered animals have demonstrated that a variety of immune cells in both the innate and adaptive immune systems are involved in tumor immunoediting of MCA-induced fibrosarcoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>).

However, activating receptors constitutively expressed on T cells and NK cells in the spleen have not yet been identified. In the present and previous studies, we showed that DNAM-1 was involved in CTL and NK cell&#x02013;mediated tumor cytolysis in vitro (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>) and in the rejection of transplanted tumor cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>), suggesting that DNAM-1 was responsible for CTL and/or NK cell&#x02013;mediated immune surveillance of fibrosarcoma development induced by MCA.</p></sec><sec><title>DNAM-1 deficiency enhanced the development of 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA)&#x02013;induced papilloma</title><p>To examine whether DNAM-1 is involved in immune surveillance of tumors other than MCA-induced fibrosarcoma, we treated WT and DNAM-1&#x02013;deficient mice with DMBA, a chemical carcinogen that induces papillomas on the skin.
