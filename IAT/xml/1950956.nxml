Like recombination events, DSBs occur at hotspots in the genome, but the genetic factors responsible for most hotspots have remained elusive. Here we describe in fission yeast the genome-wide distribution of meiosis-specific Rec12-DNA linkages, which closely parallel DSBs measured by conventional Southern blot hybridization. Prominent DSB hotspots are located &#x0223c;65 kb apart, separated by intervals with little or no detectable breakage. Most hotspots lie within exceptionally large intergenic regions. Thus, the chromosomal architecture responsible for hotspots in fission yeast is markedly different from that of budding yeast, in which DSB hotspots are much more closely spaced and, in many regions of the genome, occur at each promoter.

Meiosis comprises a pair of special nuclear divisions that convert diploid somatic cells into haploid sex cells; in humans, meiosis leads to formation of eggs and sperm. By introducing double-strand breaks (DSBs) into their own DNA during meiosis, organisms promote recombination and hence production of viable sex cells. Although meiotic DSBs, and therefore recombination, occur throughout genomes, they arise at high frequency in certain genomic regions called hotspots, whose molecular bases are rarely understood. In this article we determine the locations of DSBs across the entire genome of the fission yeast <named-content content-type="genus-species">Schizosaccharomyces pombe</named-content> by taking advantage of physical linkages between DNA and the protein Rec12 that makes DSBs. This analysis shows that most of the DSB hotspots are in exceptionally large intergenic (gene-free) regions spaced on average about 65 kb apart and making up only a small fraction of the genome. Between the hotspots we see very little evidence of DSBs. The concentration of hotspots in large intergenic regions suggests that DSBs may be determined by special nucleotide sequences buried in these regions. Determining these special sequences will allow predictions of hotspots and, perhaps, the proteins and features of genome architecture that lead to DSBs being made at these special sites.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Cromie GA, Hyppa RW, Cam HP, Farah JA, Grewal SIS, et al.

Using the fission yeast <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe,</italic> we analyze an event, the formation of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), which is essential for meiotic recombination. We find that hotspots of DSB formation occur primarily in unusually large intergenic regions (IGRs) and are widely separated by apparently break-free regions. Our results show that a clearly identifiable subset of noncoding DNA has a special function that is critical for meiosis. These results contrast with those obtained in the distantly related budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae.</italic></p><p>Meiosis consists of two special nuclear divisions during which chromosome number is reduced from two in somatic cells to one in gametes. Uniquely, in the first meiotic division homologs, rather than sister chromatids, segregate from each other.

Repair of the DSBs by interaction with a homolog produces the crossovers (reciprocal recombination events) important for homolog segregation and for the generation of genetic diversity. DSBs are formed by a meiosis-specific protein Spo11 (Rec12 in <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. pombe</named-content>) through a topoisomerase-like mechanism, in which a tyrosine residue of the protein forms a phosphodiester covalent linkage with each 5&#x02032; end at the DSB &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030141-b003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030141-b004">4</xref>&#x0005d;. DSBs can be detected by extraction of DNA from meiotic cells and analyzing it by Southern blot hybridizations, which reveal distinct hotspots of break formation. DSBs are transient in wild-type cells but accumulate to high levels in mutants, such as <italic>rad50S,</italic> in which the Spo11 or Rec12 protein is not removed from the ends of breaks &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030141-b002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030141-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d;. Analysis of DSBs is thus more sensitive in <italic>rad50S</italic> cells.</p><p>DSB hotspots were first detected at recombination hotspots, sites at which gene conversion (nonreciprocal recombination) occurs at especially high frequency. Gene conversion hotspots have been identified in the wild-type chromosomes of many species, including humans, and may be a universal aspect of meiotic recombination. A hotspot created by the <italic>ade6-M26</italic> mutation in <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. pombe</named-content> has been especially informative.

At both hotspots, but not at <italic>ura1</italic>, strong PCR signals were observed at 4, 5, and 6 h after meiotic induction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030141-sg001">Figure S1</xref>), in parallel with the accumulation of DSBs at these times in <italic>rad50S</italic> cells as measured by Southern blot hybridizations &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030141-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d;.

Since no crosslinking agent such as formaldehyde was used, we infer that the observed PCR signals using the IPs reflect covalent linkage or very tight binding of Rec12 specifically to DNA at meiotic hotspots.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Genome-Wide Analysis of Rec12-DNA Linkages</title><p>To extend this analysis to the entire genome, we analyzed DNA in IPs of chromatin prepared from cells harvested before and 5 h after meiotic induction, using tiling microarrays of oligonucleotides (60-mers; &#x0201c;probes&#x0201d;) spaced on average every 300 bp across the <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. pombe</named-content> genome &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030141-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d;.

We have analyzed three meiotic inductions, two with a haploid strain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030141-sd001">Dataset S1</xref>) and one with a diploid (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030141-sd002">Dataset S2</xref>). These strains are <italic>pat1&#x02013;114</italic> (Ts) mutants, which initiate meiosis synchronously when the temperature is raised, even from the haploid state &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030141-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;; where tested, haploids and diploids give DSB patterns indistinguishable by Southern blot analysis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030141-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Using the tiling microarrays, we compared the Rec12-DNA signals obtained using the IPs to those obtained using WCEs. The ratio of the IP:WCE signals at each probe reflects the enrichment of DNA linked to Rec12. This ratio was normalized using the median values of the IP and WCE signals for all of the &#x0223c;41,000 probes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030141-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d;. Because the chromatin DNA was sheared to &#x0223c;0.5&#x02013;1 kb before immunoprecipitation, and because Spo11 (and likely Rec12) becomes linked to both 5&#x02032; ends at a DSB &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030141-b004">4</xref>&#x0005d;, we expect genuine Rec12-DNA signals to hybridize to at least three adjacent probes on the array. For our subsequent analysis we thus excluded isolated single or double probes (&#x0201c;spikes&#x0201d;) with high values (IP:WCE ratios &#x0003e;2), as done similarly by Cam et al<italic>.</italic> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030141-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d;. High points in the induced (5 h) data corresponding to spuriously high uninduced (0 h) points were also removed. The effect of this filtering and its comparison with other noise-reducing methods are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030141-sg002">Figure S2</xref>. High Rec12 enrichment ratios in the 0-h data are restricted to isolated spikes, whereas in the 5-h data high enrichment ratios are also seen in contiguous groups of high ratio probes, indicative of genuine Rec12 enrichment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030141-sg010">Figure S10</xref>). Filtering removed the spikes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030141-sg011">Figure S11</xref>). As expected &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030141-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;, the filtered data from the 0-h samples were approximately normally distributed, whereas the data from the 5-h samples were approximately normally distributed but with an additional, substantial non-normal distribution of high values (i.e., sites of Rec12-DNA linkage) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030141-sg003">Figures S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030141-sg004">S4</xref>). Greater variance in the diploid 0-h background distribution meant that filtering of spikes was somewhat less effective in that dataset than in the others.</p><p>We first focused our attention on a 0.5-Mb region near the left end of Chromosome I, defined by <italic>Not</italic>I restriction fragment J, which we have previously analyzed extensively for meiotic recombination and DSBs &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030141-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d;. Our microarray analysis reveals a consistent distribution of Rec12-DNA linkages that closely parallels the distribution of DSBs determined by Southern blot hybridization (see next section). Strong Rec12-DNA signals (IP:WCE ratios &#x0003e;2 and up to &#x0223c;40) were observed at &#x0223c;20 consecutive probes at the position of the previously mapped <italic>mbs1</italic> and <italic>mbs2</italic> DSB hotspots of <italic>Not</italic>I fragment J in each of the three inductions (5-h data; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030141-g001">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030141-sg005">S5</xref>). Additional strong hotspots of Rec12-DNA linkage were observed at six other sites to the right of the <italic>mbs2&#x02013;mbs1</italic> pair. This pattern was consistent for all three inductions, and the hotspots were essentially absent in the uninduced (0-h) samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030141-sg005">Figure S5</xref>). Between the obvious hotspots in the 5-h DNA the signals varied in a small range around a ratio of 1, similar to the 0-h data and consistent with the expected background (non-Rec12 enriched) distribution &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030141-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;. Thus, the microarray analysis reveals strong hotspots of Rec12-DNA linkage separated by large regions in which linkage is undetectable (see additional discussion below).</p><fig id="pgen-0030141-g001" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Rec12-DNA Linkages Occur at Strong Hotspots Separated by Cold Regions across <italic>Not</italic>I Fragment J (524-1025 kb from the Left End of Chromosome I)</title><p>Haploid strain GP6013 bearing the <italic>rec12&#x02013;201::6His-2FLAG</italic> allele was induced and analyzed for Rec12-DNA linkage by microarray analysis before (0 h; blue line) and 5 h (red line; mean of two experiments) after meiotic induction.

Thus, prominent peaks are more strongly enriched in large IGRs than are weak peaks.

We discuss below the significance of these observations.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>A current critical question is which genomic features and underlying nucleotide sequences distinguish meiotic DSB hotspots from other portions of the genome. Our global microarray analysis permits a genome-wide analysis of meiotic DSBs in fission yeast. The distribution of meiotic DNA covalently linked to Rec12 is nearly identical to the distribution of meiotic DSBs determined directly by Southern blot hybridizations. This correspondence holds both for the presence of DSB hotspots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030141-g002">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030141-g003">3</xref>) and for their relative strengths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030141-g004">Figure 4</xref>). We can thus use the more easily determined Rec12-DNA linkage data from microarray analysis as a valid proxy for DSBs genome-wide. Because the limit of detection on our Southern blots is &#x0223c;0.5&#x00025; (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030141-sg006">Figure S6</xref>) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030141-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d;, we concentrate on prominent Rec12 peaks, those whose integrals indicate a DSB frequency &#x02265;0.5&#x00025; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030141-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Our analysis of the 194 prominent hotspots that we identified in the 12.6-Mb <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. pombe</named-content> genome shows that prominent DSBs are detectable at hotspots spaced on average &#x0223c;65 kb apart (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030141-sg007">Figure S7</xref>).

We observed a weak negative correlation between Rec8 binding and Rec12-DNA linkage. For example, 83&#x00025; of the 69 prominent Rec12 peaks on Chromosome II are centered on an 11-probe window whose Rec8-binding ratio is below the median for Chromosome II (ignoring the centromere), significantly different from the 50&#x00025; expected (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001; contingency chi-squared test). Among the 55 weak Rec12 peaks, this bias falls to 64&#x00025;, not significantly different from 50&#x00025;. Conversely, the quarter of probes on Chromosome II with the highest Rec8 enrichment ratios contain only 9&#x00025; of the prominent Rec12 peaks, less than the 25&#x00025; expected, and the quarter with the lowest Rec8 enrichment ratios contain 55&#x00025; of the prominent Rec12 peaks, more than the 25&#x00025; expected. Therefore, in <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. pombe</named-content> as in <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. cerevisiae</named-content>, DSBs are associated with regions of low Rec8 localization, but neither distribution is very useful for predicting the other.</p><p>As noted above, Atf1-Pcr1 and perhaps other transcription factors are required for some DSB hotspots. We therefore looked for a correlation between DSB hotspot positions and the promoters of genes induced during meiosis. Among such genes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030141-b029">29</xref>&#x0005d;, we found no significant enrichment of Rec12 peaks 5&#x02032; of the corresponding open reading frame. We then looked among all genes with Rec12-peaks in their presumptive promoters for enrichment of related functions, as indicated by related gene ontology (GO) terms. Using the GOstat Web server (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gostat.wehi.edu.au">http://gostat.wehi.edu.au</ext-link>) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030141-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d; with Benjamini correction for multiple hypothesis testing, we found a significant enrichment for terms, such as GO:0051704 (Interaction between organisms), GO:0000746 and GO:0019953 (Conjugation and Sexual reproduction, subsets of GO:0051704), and GO:0003700 (Transcription factor activity), listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030141-st002">Table S2</xref>. The causal basis of these correlations is not obvious. However, the enrichment of Rec12 peaks in the promoter regions of genes associated with conditions and processes related to meiosis and meiotic induction suggests that meiosis-specific chromatin remodeling may occur at some promoters, allowing access or activation of Rec12 for DSB formation. A particular group of transcription factors and transcription factor-binding sequences may be involved. As noted above, this is the case for the <italic>M26</italic> hotspot and Atf1-Pcr1, factors involved in the meiosis-specific remodeling of chromatin and Rec12-dependent DSB formation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030141-b031">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030141-b033">33</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>In <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. pombe</named-content> mitotic replication origins are spaced about 25&#x02013;30 kb apart, and, where tested, the same origins are used during both mitotic growth and meiosis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030141-b034">34</xref>&#x0005d;. We found, however, no obvious relationship between origins of replication and meiotic DSB hotspots. For example, 14&#x00025; of all replication origins correspond to haploid 5-h probe positions with a Rec12 IP:WCE ratio &#x0003e;2 (i.e., all regions of Rec12-DNA linkages), not significantly different from the number expected based on the proportion (11&#x00025;) of all probes with a Rec12 enrichment value &#x0003e;2 (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05; contingency chi-squared test). Therefore, the frequency of origins of replication is neither enriched nor depleted significantly in regions of Rec12-DNA linkage.</p><p>We looked for an unusual nucleotide sequence composition surrounding DSB hotspots and found only a weak correlation with higher than average guanine-cytosine (GC) content. For example, 5-kb windows centered on the 194 prominent Rec12 peak positions have a slightly enriched GC content compared to 5-kb windows, moved in 100-bp steps, covering the whole genome (median of 36.6&#x00025; versus 36.0&#x00025;; <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001 by two-tailed t-test). However, base composition is a very poor predictor of prominent Rec12 peak position, as 37&#x00025; of prominent Rec12 peaks are centered on windows with GC content below the global median and only 0.2&#x00025; of windows with GC content above the global median are centered on a prominent Rec12 peak. No significant GC content enrichment was seen at weak Rec12 peak positions. Sliding windows of 0.5 kb, 1 kb, or 10 kb showed even less difference between peak-centered and whole-genome window compositions (unpublished data). In <italic>S. cerevisiae,</italic> DSB hotspots are also weakly correlated with higher than average GC content when a 5-kb sliding window is used &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030141-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d;.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Comparison of <italic>S. pombe, S. cerevisiae,</italic> and Human DSB Hotspot Distributions</title><p>As in <italic>S. pombe,</italic> DSBs have been analyzed in <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. cerevisiae</named-content> by both direct Southern blot analysis and microarray analysis of DNA covalently linked to Spo11, the Rec12 homolog &#x0005b;e.g.,20,21,35&#x0005d;.
