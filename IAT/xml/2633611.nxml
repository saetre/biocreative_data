An HIV-1 accessory protein, Vpu, acts as an antagonist of tetherin. Here, we show that positive selection is evident in primate tetherin sequences and that HIV-1 Vpu appears to have specifically adapted to antagonize variants of tetherin found in humans and chimpanzees. Tetherin variants found in rhesus macaques (rh), African green monkeys (agm) and mice were able to inhibit HIV-1 particle release, but were resistant to antagonism by HIV-1 Vpu. Notably, reciprocal exchange of transmembrane domains between human and monkey tetherins conferred sensitivity and resistance to Vpu, identifying this protein domain as a critical determinant of Vpu function. Indeed, differences between hu-tetherin and rh-tetherin at several positions in the transmembrane domain affected sensitivity to antagonism by Vpu. Two alterations in the hu-tetherin transmembrane domain, that correspond to differences found in rh- and agm-tetherin proteins, were sufficient to render hu-tetherin completely resistant to HIV-1 Vpu. Interestingly, transmembrane and cytoplasmic domain sequences in primate tetherins exhibit variation at numerous codons that is likely the result of positive selection, and some of these changes coincide with determinants of HIV-1 Vpu sensitivity. Overall, these data indicate that tetherin could impose a barrier to viral zoonosis as a consequence of positive selection that has been driven by ancient viral antagonists, and that the HIV-1 Vpu protein has specialized to target the transmembrane domains found in human/chimpanzee tetherin proteins.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Tetherin is a cell surface protein that acts as an antiviral defense. It functions by tethering newly assembled HIV-1 particles to the surface of the infected cell, such that the viral particle is unable to depart and disseminate to other, uninfected cells. HIV-1 possesses an antagonist of tetherin, termed Vpu, that abolishes tetherin function. We found that HIV-1 is an effective antagonist of human and chimpanzee variants of tetherin but is unable to antagonize tetherins from two monkey species. Additionally, we found that sequence differences in a portion of the protein that is embedded in cell membranes determined whether or not it could be antagonized by Vpu. Since the Vpu protein is alsi a membrane embedded protein, this result suggests that Vpu and tetherin interact within cell membranes. We also show that tetherin has been evolving rapidly, and has likely been placed under selective pressure to change sequence. Notably, portions of tetherin that appear to have been placed under selective pressure coincide with positions that influence Vpu antagonism. Therefore, the evolutionary history of primates determines the effectiveness of HIV-1 Vpu in modern species. Thus, tetherin could impose a barrier to cross species transmission of retroviruses.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Eukaryotic cells can constitutively or inducibly express a variety of molecules that inhibit the replication of viruses. Among these antiviral defenses are components of the type-I interferon (IFN) -induced innate immune system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000300-Samuel1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000300-Stetson1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. In turn, viruses have evolved to express proteins that either limit IFN-induced gene expression or directly antagonize the function of antiviral proteins.</p><p>We and others recently identified an IFN-induced antiviral protein, termed tetherin, that functions by a novel mechanism. Specifically, tetherin blocks the release of nascent virions from HIV-1 infected cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000300-Neil1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000300-VanDamme1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Tetherin is an integral membrane protein with a unique topology. In particular, it encodes a transmembrane anchor towards its N-terminus, as well as a putative glycophosphatidyl-inositol lipid anchor at its C-terminus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000300-Kupzig1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. These two membrane anchors are linked by an extracellular domain that is predicted to form a coiled-coil. Ectopic expression of tetherin in cells that do not ordinarily express it results in the formation of protease-sensitive tethers that causes retention of retrovirus particles on the surface of infected cells, from where they can be internalized <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000300-Neil2">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000300-VanDamme1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000300-Neil3">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000300-Jouvenet1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. This pronounced ability to retain and internalize HIV-1 particles is present constitutively in cells that normally express tetherin, but is suppressed when tetherin is depleted. Tetherin colocalizes with Gag and appears to act by inducing adherence of virion and cell membranes. Thus, virions that are retained by tetherin are fully formed and mature, and have lipid bilayers that are discontinuous with cell membranes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000300-Neil2">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000300-Neil3">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Notably, an HIV-1 accessory transmembrane protein, Vpu, acts as a viral antagonist of tetherin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000300-Neil2">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000300-VanDamme1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Indeed tetherin dramatically inhibits the release of Vpu-defective HIV-1 virions, but has only modest effects on wild-type Vpu-expressing HIV-1. Moreover, Vpu colocalizes with tetherin and prevents the localization of tetherin to nascent virions, perhaps through its ability to reduce the amount of tetherin at the cell surface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000300-Neil2">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000300-VanDamme1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, the existence of tetherin explains the previously observed requirement for Vpu during HIV-1 particle release from certain cells, particularly those that have been exposed to type-I IFN <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000300-Neil1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000300-Neil3">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000300-Geraghty1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000300-Strebel1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The wide expression of tetherin upon exposure of cells to IFN-alpha <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000300-Neil2">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000300-Blasius1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref> and the wide range of retroviruses and filoviruses that are inhibited by tetherin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000300-Jouvenet1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref> suggests that it might be a general component of an innate immune defense against many enveloped viruses. As such, tetherin could provide an impetus for the evolution of antagonists in viruses other than HIV-1. Indeed, the Kaposi's sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV) also encodes a likely antagonist of tetherin, since expression of the KSHV K5 protein decreases the steady state level of tetherin protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000300-Bartee1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Additionally, certain retroviral envelope proteins, in particular the HIV-2 Env, have Vpu-like activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000300-Bour1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000300-Abada1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, it seems likely that tetherin antagonists other than Vpu exist.</p><p>Here, we show that tetherin proteins from different species exhibit marked differences in sensitivity to antagonism by HIV-1 Vpu. Specifically, tetherin proteins from two old world monkey species as well as from mouse, are effective inhibitors of HIV-1 particle release, but are resistant to Vpu. Moreover, we show that the transmembrane domain of tetherin contains determinants of sensitivity to Vpu, and that two mutations in the human tetherin sequence are sufficient to generate a protein that is entirely resistant to antagonism by Vpu. Interestingly, tetherin sequences that are predicted to be accessible to cytoplasmic or integral membrane antagonists, such as HIV-1 Vpu, exhibit evidence of positive selection at numerous codons, including some that we demonstrate determine the effectiveness of Vpu antagonism. Thus, past selective pressures imposed on tetherin by viral antagonists likely provides a barrier to the establishment of zoonotic infections by modern primate lentiviruses, and potentially enveloped viruses from other species, whose spread depends on antagonism of tetherin function.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Resistance of nonhuman tetherin proteins to antagonism by HIV-1 Vpu</title><p>Inspection of sequence databases revealed the presence of putative tetherin proteins in various mammalian species. For functional analyses, we amplified tetherin sequences from cDNAs derived from rhesus macaque (rh), African green monkey (agm), chimpanzee (cpz) and mouse (mo). Coexpression of hu-tetherin, cpz-tetherin, rh-tetherin, agm-tetherin, mo-tetherin, with HIV-1 (delVpu) caused a marked decease in the yield of viral particles, as measured using infectivity or western blot assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000300-g001">Fig. 1 A,B,C</xref>). The magnitude of the reduction in virus yield varied somewhat, depending which tetherin protein was coexpressed. In each case, inhibition of virion release by tetherin did not lead to a dramatic accumulation of cell associated viral proteins. This finding suggest that the virions that are retained by tetherin, are destroyed at rate that exceeds, or is not greatly different, to their synthesis. This would likely be through endocytosis, followed by lysosomal degradation. Moreover, it may simply be the case that only a fraction of the viral protein that is synthesized by infected cells is actually released as particles. Thus the amount of viral protein that is observed in cell lysates would be determined by its intrinsic turnover rate, rather than particle release versus retention.</p><fig id="ppat-1000300-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1000300.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Effect of nonhuman tetherins on HIV-1 particle release and antagonism by Vpu.</title><p>A, B) Western blot analysis (anti HIV-1 capsid, p24) of cell and virion lysates following transfection of cells with WT and Vpu deleted (delVpu) proviral plasmids, alone (none) or in combination with 50 ng of the indicated human (hu) rhesus monkey (rh) African green monkey (agm) tetherin-HA expression plasmids (A) or 50 ng of hu- or mouse (mo) HA-tetherin expression plasmids (B).

However, a caveat to be attached to this conclusion is that transiently expressed tetherin exisits as a variety of species, presumably reflecting heterogeneous glycosylation. At present it is not clear whether all of the various tetherin species are active, and it is possible that the amount of active tetherin is not uniformly represented in analyses of total tetherin protein levels. Nonetheless, each tetherin protein was clearly capable of reducing infectious HIV-1(delVpu) yield, by 20-fold or more. Strikingly, however, and in contrast to hu-tetherin, the rh-, agm- and mo-tetherin proteins were equally efficient in reducing HIV-1(WT) and HIV-1(delVpu) virion yield (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000300-g001">Fig. 1A,B,C</xref>). Conversely, as with hu-tetherin, HIV-1(WT) was substantially resistant to inhibition by cpz-tetherin, while the release of HIV-1(delVpu) particles was strongly inhbited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000300-g001">Fig. 1 D, E</xref>). Thus, the non-hominid tetherin proteins were apparently insensitive to antagonism by HIV-1 Vpu. while both hu-tetherin and cpz-tetherin were Vpu-sensitive.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Tetherin transmembrane sequences can transfer resistance or sensitivity to Vpu</title><p>Earlier work indicated that expression of an intact transmembrane (TM) segment of HIV-1 Vpu was most important, and perhaps sufficient, to enhance HIV-1 particle release <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000300-Schubert1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. This finding, combined with the notion that only the N-terminal portion of tetherin should be physically accessible to Vpu, suggested the possibility that Vpu might target the transmembrane domain of tetherin. Thus, we generated chimeric proteins, termed hu(agmTM) and hu(rhTM), in which the transmembrane domain of hu-tetherin was replaced with corresponding sequences from rh- or agm-tetherin. These chimeric proteins differed in the magnitude with which they inhibited HIV-1 virion release, concordant with differences in expression level (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000300.s001">Fig. S1B</xref>), but both were entirely resistant to antagonism by Vpu (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000300-g002">Fig. 2A, C</xref>).

However, both proteins selectively inhibited HIV-1(delVpu) particle release, indicating that they were sensitive to antagonism by HIV-1 Vpu. Thus, the exchange of the TM domain between tetherin proteins from different species transferred sensitivity and resistance to antagonism by HIV-1 Vpu.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Determinants of Vpu sensitivity in human tetherin</title><p>Inspection of tetherin TM domain protein sequences revealed several differences between the monkey and human proteins, distributed along the length of the TM domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000300-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). To determine which of these were responsible for the Vpu resistance of the monkey tetherin proteins to antagonism by Vpu, we generated mutant forms of hu-tetherin, each bearing an individual change in the TM domain that is found at the corresponding position in rh-tetherin. (The exceptions to this scheme were the L23V,L24I mutant in which two contiguous amino acids were changed to their rh-tetherin counterparts and the delGI change, where a two amino acid deletion that is present in the rh-tetherin sequence was introduced). This panel of mutant tetherin proteins varied in the potency with which they reduced HIV-1(delVpu) virion yield, and in their ability to be antagonized by Vpu (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000300-g003">Fig. 3B,C</xref>). Variation in the potency of antiviral activity among the mutant panel correlated with expression level in most cases (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000300.s001">Fig. S1C</xref>). Notably, none of the individual hu-tetherin mutants recapitulated the phenotype of the rh-tetherin or hu(rhTM)-tetherin proteins that appeared completely resistant to Vpu antagonism. Rather, several of the individual mutants appeared partly resistant to antagonism by Vpu, in that Vpu was not able enhance virion release as effectively in their presence as it did in the presence of unmanipulated hu-tetherin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000300-g003">Fig. 3B,C</xref>). Because these analyses were slightly confounded by the variation in the potency and expression of the individual tetherin mutants, we measured infectious HIV-1(WT) and HIV-1(delVpu) virion yield in the presence of varying levels of the mutant tetherin proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000300-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). Overall, these analyses identified a single amino acid difference (P40L) as contributing substantially to the Vpu sensitivity of hu-tetherin and the Vpu-resistance of rh-tetherin. Other changes in the hu-tetherin TM had more modest effects, or no effect on Vpu sensitivity, when present in isolation, or substantially affected tetherin potency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000300-g003">Fig. 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000300-g004">Fig. 4</xref>).</p><fig id="ppat-1000300-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1000300.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Effects of individual TM domain mutations on tetherin potency and Vpu antagonism.</title><p>A) Differences between hu- and rh-tetherin TM domains.

In particular, several mutations were combined with the most obvious difference between human and monkey tetherin TM domains, namely the delGI change. Notably, the delGI,T45I double mutant strongly inhibited HIV-1 particle release and was completely resistant to antagonism by Vpu (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000300-g005">Fig. 5A,B</xref>).

However, this double mutation generated a tetherin protein with only modest activity. Nonetheless, when combined with a mutation at a third proximal residue (generating V30G,I33V,I36L) this combined mutation conferred partial resistance to Vpu antagonism, in the context of a protein with potent antiviral activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000300-g005">Fig. 5A, B</xref>). Moreover a hu-tetherin bearing combined delGI,I33V,I36V mutations was almost completely resistant to antagonism by Vpu, and exhibited substantial antiviral activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000300-g005">Fig. 5A, B</xref>). Finally, combining the delGI mutation with subsitiutions at contiguous residues that corresponded to rh-tetherin residues (delGI, L23V,L24I) resulted in a protein with only weak inhibitory activity, whereas combining the delGI mutation with contiguous L23A,L24V mutations (corresponding to agm-tetherin residues) generated a protein that was potent and partly Vpu resistant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000300-g005">Fig. 5A, B</xref>).

Firstly, among the nonprimate mammalian tetherin sequences, the N-terminal cytoplasmic domain was hypervariable, both in length and sequence (data not shown). Because of these properties, it proved impossible to unambiguously align non-primate and primate tetherin sequences in order to perform tests for positive selection. Therefore, we confined further analyses to primate tetherin sequences, which could be aligned unambiguously throughout the entire length of the coding sequence. Even within primates there was considerable sequence divergence between species, ranging from 0.5&#x00025; to 40.0&#x00025; at the nucleotide level. Sampling within three old world monkey species (rhesus macaques, pig-tailed macaques and sooty mangabeys) also revealed the presence of significant polymorphism within species (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000300.s002">Fig. S2</xref> and data not shown); it remains to be seen whether nonsynonymous polymorphism extends to the <italic>tetherin</italic> locus of other primate lineages. Positive selection was tested using the REL(HyPhy) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000300-Pond1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref> and CODEML (PAML) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000300-Yang1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref> methods and these analyses revealed that codons exhibiting high dN/dS ratios, and therefore likely to have been subjected to positive selection, were enriched in the N-terminal cytoplasmic and TM domains in primate tetherins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000300-g007">Fig. 7</xref>). Tetherin evolution in primates was also evaluated under several standard models of sequence evolution as implemented in the CODEML program. These comprise three nested pairs of models (M0 and M3; M1a and M2a; M7 and M8) in which the second model of each pair is derived from the first by allowing sites to evolve under positive selection. Nested models were compared using the likelihood ratio test, and in each case allowing individual sites to evolve under positive selection (M3, M2a, M8) gave a significantly better fit to the primate sequence data than the corresponding model without positive selection (M0, M1a and M7, respectively) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1000300-t001">Table 1</xref>). The M3, M2a and M8 models identified a largely overlapping set of sites in the tetherin coding sequence with dN/dS&#x0003e;1, consistent with an evolutionary history characterized by frequent episodes of positive selection. Notably, some codons that exhibited a high probability of having evolved under positive selection coincided with residues that determined the effectiveness of Vpu antagonism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000300-g007">Fig. 7</xref>). However, there were numerous additional codons, particularly in the tetherin cytoplasmic domain, that also exhibited high dN/dS ratios, suggesting that antagonists other than Vpu have also imposed selective pressure on primate tetherin sequences.</p><fig id="ppat-1000300-g007" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1000300.g007</object-id><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>Positive selection in primate tetherin sequences.</title><p>A diagram representing the various domains of the tetherin protein is shown, below plots of the dN/dS ratio (upper plot) and the Bayes factor for dN&#x0003e;dS (lower plot) at each codon in an alignment of primate tetherin coding sequences.

For the three comparisons indicated, the second model only differs from the first in permitting some form of positive selection to act on individual sites.

The subsequent discovery that tetherin is an IFN-induced inhibitor that is antagonized by Vpu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000300-Neil2">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000300-VanDamme1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref> leads to the prediction that agm-tetherin should be resistant to Vpu. Here we show that agm-tetherin, as well as rh-tetherin and mo-tetherin are indeed resistant to antagonism by Vpu, in contrast to tetherin variants found in species (human and chimpanzee) that are permissive hosts for HIV-1. Moreover, these studies identify the TM domain of hu-tetherin as a major determinant of the effectiveness of Vpu antagonism. That the TM domain of tetherin harbors critical determinants of Vpu sensitivity is concordant with previous observations indicating that the TM domain of Vpu is critical for its virus release activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000300-Schubert1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, these observations suggest a model in which Vpu and tetherin interact via their TM domains. Such an interaction could be direct, but further work will be required to resolve whether this is indeed the case, and precisely how Vpu tetherin antagonism and/or downregulation from the cell surface is achieved is not known. In this regard, the recent report suggests that the host cell protein CAML is important for Vpu activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000300-Varthakavi2">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, but how tetherin, Vpu and CAML interact in a functional sense is unclear at present.</p><p>Importantly, no single change in the hu-tetherin TM domain abolished Vpu sensitivity, which is consistent with a model in which Vpu, or a bridging factor, makes multiple contacts with the TM domain of tetherin. Indeed, the hu-tetherin mutant, delGI,T45I, that had the most striking phenotype, in that it retained full activity but was completely resistant to antagonism by Vpu, harbored mutations at positions close to the opposing ends of the TM domain. Additionally, a different combination of mutations (delGI, I33V, I36L) also conferred complete Vpu resistance, again consistent with the notion that multiple contacts with the tetherin TM domain are made during its antagonism by Vpu. Concordant with these findings, the chimpanzee and human tetherin proteins were both sensitive to HIV-1 Vpu, and differed from each other at only a single position in their TM domains. Thus, it is likely only minor, if any, adaptation in the SIV<sub>CPZ</sub> Vpu protein that is immediately ancestral to the HIV-1 Vpu proteins would have been required in order for it to target human tetherin.</p><p>Primate tetherin TM domain sequences, that should only be accessible to integral membrane antagonists, exhibit clear evidence of positive selection at several codons, including some that determine the effectiveness of Vpu antagonism. Thus, it is likely that antagonists encoded by pathogenic viruses have driven the selection of the tetherin variants that exist in modern primates. Such antagonists could include Vpu itself, since several primate lentiviruses encode Vpu proteins (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.hiv.lanl.gov/">http://www.hiv.lanl.gov/</ext-link>). However, other viral antagonists, including the KSHV K5 protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000300-Bartee1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, or homolgues of it, are also reasonable candidates for factors that have imposed selective pressure on tetherin sequences. In addition to the TM, several sites with the highest dN/dS ratios mapped to the N-terminal cytoplasmic domain. Such sites may define an accessible target exploited by other virally encoded inhibitors of tetherin. It is noteworthy in this regard that many primate lentiviruses do not encode a Vpu like protein, and may have evolved alternative strategies targeting this or other regions of the protein. Additionally, tetherin sequences might also have evolved to better target specific types of viral particles in some host species, as a consequence of varying viral challenges. Such evolution might also include adaptations in domains of tetherin that, for example, modify its trafficking within cells (likely including the cytoplasmic and TM domains). Overall, there are several potential sources of evolutionary pressure that could give rise to positive selection and diversification of tetherin genes. We note that the sequence of the TM domain of tetherin is obviously constrained by the need to retain the biochemical characteristics of a TM domain, which might mitigate against the detection of positive selection in this protein domain.</p><p>HIV-1 is well adapted to replicate in human cells, but fails to replicate in many nonhuman primate cells. This is in large part because it is unable to evade or antagonize the species-specific variants of antiviral genes, such as TRIM5 and APOBEC3, which show evidence of positive selection that is assumed to have resulted from past retroviral epidemics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000300-Sawyer1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000300-Song1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. Tetherin represents a third example of an antiviral gene in monkeys that exhibits activity against intact HIV-1 as a consequence of positive selection in the primate lineage. Thus an array of antiviral molecules limit the replication of primate lentiviruses in non-natural host cells, creating barriers to zoonosis, and revealing potential opportunities to mobilize intrinsic antiretroviral defenses by therapeutic inhibition of the activity of their viral antagonists.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Plasmid construction</title><p>A hu-tetherin cDNA, cloned into pCR3.1 vector, and its N-terminally HA tagged counterpart have been described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000300-Neil2">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>.
