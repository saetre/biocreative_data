Chemical fractionation of BN108 showed that its cytotoxicity is associated with timosaponins, steroidal saponins of coprostane type. Timosaponin BII (TBII) is a major saponin in BN108, but it shows little cytotoxicity. A much less abundant TAIII induces cell death in tumor cells but not in normal cells, reproducing the selectivity of the total extract BN108. Glycosidase treatment, by removing the extra sugar moiety in TBII, converts it to TAIII and confers cytotoxic activity. Analysis of the mechanisms of death induced by TAIII revealed activation of two distinct pro-apoptotic pathways: first, inhibition of mTORC1 manifested in much reduced phosphorylation of mTORC1 targets; second, induction of endoplasmic reticulum stress culminating in phosphorylation of eIF2&#x003b1; and activation of caspase 4. These pro-apoptotic pathways are activated by TAIII selectively in tumor cells but not in normal cells. Both pathways play a causative role in TAIII cytotoxicity, as restoration of either mTOR activity or relief of ER stress alone offer only partial protection from TAIII. Inhibition of mTORC1 and induction of ER stress apparently contribute to the induction of the previously reported autophagic response in TAIII-treated cells. TAIII induced autophagy plays a protective role in TAIII induced death signaling, and failure to mount autophagic response is associated with heightened sensitivity to TAIII induced apoptosis. The multiple death-promoting and apparently tumor-selective responses to TAIII, its ability to inhibit mTORC1, and the possibility of further enhancing its cytotoxicity by pharmacological inhibition of autophagy, make TAIII an attractive candidate for development as a cancer therapeutic agent.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>This work describes the anti-tumor activity of the aqueous extract from the plant <italic>Anemarrhena asphodeloides</italic> (BN108), and one of the timosaponins present in the extract, TAIII <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007283-Kawasaki1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

TAIII was recently reported to induce apoptosis and protective autophagy in HeLa cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007283-Sy1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. However, the mechanism through which TAIII induces cell death remains unclear.</p><p>Induction of apoptosis is a prominent mode of cytotoxic action of many chemotherapeutic drugs. Some of them induce apoptosis through a mitochondrial pathway, but some, most notably the proteasome inhibitors, induce cell death via endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress mediated apoptotic pathway. ER stress is elicited by a wide variety of conditions including nutrient deprivation, impaired protein degradation or secretion, calcium imbalance and many others. ER stress involves specific transcriptional and translational responses that are largely controlled by three ER resident sensor proteins: IRE1, ATF6, and PERK (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007283-Mori1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007283-Ron1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>). Activated PERK phosphorylates eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF2&#x003b1;, resulting in the general inhibition of protein synthesis, but paradoxically induces a specific increase in translation of transcription factor ATF4. ATF4, in turn, induces increases in levels of several protein chaperons. Phosphorylation of eIF2&#x003b1; is central in the integrated stress response, named so because it is activated by diverse stressful conditions. Sustained or severe ER stress leads to activation of caspases, in particular caspase-4, followed by apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007283-Hitomi1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>ER stress was found recently in several independent studies to have an unanticipated consequence: induction of autophagy (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007283-HoyerHansen1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007283-Yorimitsu1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>). Autophagy is a conserved cellular pathway that serves to degrade bulk cytoplasmic material (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007283-Gozuacik1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007283-Kondo1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>). It is activated in response to nutrient and energy starvation, and after treatment with some chemotherapeutic drugs. Autophagy plays a positive role in preservation of energy and nutrients, and also contributes to degradation of misfolded proteins when this function of ER is disabled due to stress. Autophagy can play a protective role in cell survival, but often serves as a mechanism of programmed cell death (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007283-Levine1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>).</p><p>Autophagy is inhibited in cells under normal conditions (where nutrients, ATP and growth factors are in adequate supply) by a conserved cellular pathway centered on the Ser/Thr kinase target of rapamycin (mTOR) (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007283-DiazTroya1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>). mTORC1 regulates efficiency of protein translation and promotes cell growth (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007283-Proud1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007283-Sabatini1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>). The two essential direct targets of mTORC1 activity are the 70 kDa ribosomal protein S6 kinase, and the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E binding protein 1 (4eBP1). Phosphorylation of these proteins by mTORC1 serves to activate and sustain protein translation and is used as a read-out for mTORC1 activity. Inhibition of mTORC1 has profound negative consequences for protein translation and cell growth, and at the same time activates autophagy. Another mTOR containing complex, mTORC2, promotes cell signaling through phosphorylation and activation of the pro-survival and pro-proliferative kinase Akt <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007283-Sarbassov1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. mTOR kinase in the mTORC2 complex is thought to be not sensitive to inhibition by rapamycin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007283-Jacinto1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007283-Sarbassov2">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, but inhibitors of mTOR kinase domain have been developed that suppress activity of mTOR in both mTORC complexes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007283-Feldman1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007283-Thoreen1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>.

We have therefore attempted to define the active compounds in BN108 and study their mechanism of action through examination of the mode of cell death and analysis of the effects on gene and protein expression. Timosaponin AIII was identified as a major selective cytotoxic activity in BN108, and its selective cytotoxic activity involves inhibition of mTOR, induction of ER stress and protective autophagy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Reagents and antibodies</title><p>Chloroquine and EGF were purchased from Sigma.

This indicates that the TAIII is a major cytotoxic component of BN108, though it is possible and even likely that the extract contains additional cytotoxic substances such as other timosaponins identified previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007283-Saito1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The steroid cores of timosaponins AIII and BII are identical, but TBII contains an extra sugar moiety in addition to a shared disaccharide moiety (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007283-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). We have therefore attempted to determine if this sugar is responsible for the lack of the cytotoxic activity of TBII. Several glycosidases were tested for their ability to cleave TBII, and laminarinase was found to convert TBII into TAIII as determined by LC/MS analysis. Laminarinase treated preparations of TBII became cytotoxic towards two breast cancer cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007283-g002">Figure 2C</xref>) but not to MCF10A cells, similar to TAIII (not shown). We conclude that the extra sugar present in TBII interferes with its potential cytotoxicity. Enzymatic removal of this sugar moiety converts TBII to TAIII and unmasks its cytotoxicity. It will be of interest to determine if TBII could be cleaved <italic>in vivo</italic> by glycosidases (in particular, from intestinal microflora) to produce TAIII, thus strongly enhancing the anti-tumor activity of BN108 considering the relatively high TBII content in the extract.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Analysis of the changes in gene expression induced by BN108 and TAIII</title><p>To try and discern the pathways involved in cell death induction by BN108, expression array analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007283.s004">Methods S1</xref>) was performed with RNAs isolated from BT474 cells prior to and after a 4 hour treatment with BN108. Only 41 transcripts were found to be upregulated more than two-fold in BT474 cells treated with BN108, and even fewer were downregulated two-fold or more (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007283.s001">Table S1</xref>). Several genes with known anti-proliferative and/or pro-apoptotic activities were induced: REDD1/DDIT4, p21CIP, stratifin, cyclin G2, GDF15. A prominent group of BN108 induced genes represented enzymes involved in biosynthesis of cholesterol.</p><p>Among the downregulated genes with known functions were several transcripts coding for secreted proteins: amphiregulin, CYR61, thrombospondin, CXCL12, VEGF-C, as well as the pro-proliferative genes MYC and cyclin D1.</p><p>Because TAIII is at least partially responsible for the apoptosis-inducing activity of BN108, we have conducted further expression array analysis with three cell lines that showed different sensitivities to TAIII and BN108: BT474, somewhat less sensitive MDAMB231 and the relatively resistant nontransformed cell line MCF10A. TAIII treatment affected levels of many more mRNAs than BN108; but majority of transcriptional changes induced by BN108 in BT474 were also induced by TAIII. Thus, out of 42 genes upregulated by BN108 more than two-fold, 28 (i.e., two thirds) were also upregulated by TAIII. This strongly indicates that many of the cellular responses to BN108 are induced by its active constituent TAIII.</p><p>Comparisons of TAIII induced transcriptional changes between the three cell lines analyzed showed significant overlaps between BT474 and MDAMB231 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007283.s002">Table S2</xref>). However, the magnitudes of changes in RNA abundance were frequently different. In particular, induction of genes in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway was significantly muted in MDAMB231 cells compared to BT474 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0007283-t001">Table 1</xref>). On the other hand, MDAMB231 cells treated wit TAIII showed induced expression of a relatively large number of genes with functions in ER stress response and amino acid starvation, most of which were only weakly induced in BT474 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0007283-t002">Table 2</xref>). In the non-transformed MCF10A cells the genes whose expression was significantly changed after TAIII treatment were mostly distinct from transcripts affected in cancer cell lines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007283.s002">Table S2</xref>), which could reflect the resistance of MCF10A to apoptosis induction by TAIII. The discernible commonalities between MCF10A transcriptional response to TAIII and that of breast cancer cell lines were a weak induction in the former of expression of some genes in the cholesterol biosynthesis pathway, ER stress response and induction of autophagy (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0007283-t002">Table 2</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="pone-0007283-t001" position="float"><object-id

We then examined if exogenous stimulation of oncogenic receptor tyrosine kinases by a growth factor might sustain the activity of Akt and mTORC1 and confer protection from TAIII. Treatment with TAIII in presence of exogenous EGF indeed conferred a significant protection to BT474 cells and less so to MDAMB231 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007283-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). Western blot analysis of cells co-treated with TAIII and EGF revealed that in presence of EGF TAIII fails to elicit a significant reduction in phosphorylation of Akt and mTORC1 targets in BT474 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007283-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). Examination of the phosphorylation of mTOR itself in cells treated with TAIII in absence or presence of EGF showed that phosphorylation of mTOR on serine 2448 (characteristic of mTOR in mTORC1) and on mTOR on serine 2481 (characteristic of activated mTOR in mTORC2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007283-Copp1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>) are both reduced in TAIII treated BT474 cells but restored in presence of EGF. However, it should be noted that the protection conferred by EGF was only partial, even in BT474 cells where phosphorylation of mTOR, Akt and mTORC1 targets appeared to be effectively sustained in presence of EGF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007283-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). This indicates that in addition to the inhibition of mTORC1, TAIII might have other death-promoting effects on tumor cells.</p><p>To identify the other potential cellular pathways contributing to TAIII cytotoxicity in tumor cells, we examined the functional role of Id-1 that, along with Id-3 is strongly downregulated in breast cancer cells but not in MCF10A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007283-g003">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007283.s002">Table S2</xref>). Exogenous Id-1 was stably expressed in MDAMB231 cells, and higher levels of Id-1 were maintained during TAIII treatment (not shown). However, analysis of Id-1 expressing cells showed that enforced expression of Id-1 levels did not confer an improved survival during TAIII treatment (not shown), indicating that downregulation of Id-1 by TAIII could be consequences of TAIII effects on cell viability or proliferation. Moreover, concomitant downregulation of REDD1 and forced expression of Id-1 did not improve survival of MDAMB231 cells treated with TAIII (not shown).</p></sec><sec id="s3e"><title>TAIII induces ER stress</title><p>The results described above show that inhibition of mTORC1 activity during TAIII treatment plays a significant but not exclusive role in TAIII induced apoptosis.

Transcription factor ATF4, a major target of induction by activated eIF2&#x003b1;, was strongly induced in MDAMB231 cells and less so in BT474 cells indicating that the processes downstream of eIF2&#x003b1; phosphorylation are intact in both cell lines but are more robust in MDAMB231 cells. The expression array analysis did not show upregulation of RNAs for classical ER stress responders such as PDI, calreticulin and GRP78. To examine if TAIII induces a predominantly translational ER stress response, we conducted a proteomic analysis of MDAMB231 cells treated with TAIII for 4, 8 and 16 hours.

In the most sensitive cells, BT474, inhibition of autophagy did not affect the outcome of TAIII treatment, indicating that autophagy is either not induced or is not protective in these cells. However, inhibition of autophagy in MDAMB231 and particularly in the MCF10A cells lead to a significantly increased cell death in response to TAIII (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007283-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). Autophagy also played a protective role in the TAIII induced apoptosis in a breast cancer line SKBr3 and, as previously reported, HeLa cells (not shown).

This conclusion is based on several lines of evidence: TAIII demonstrates the same selectivity towards breast cancer cell lines as BN108; TAIII induces apoptosis involving caspase-4 activation similar to BN108; TAIII induces transcriptional changes in breast cancer cells that largely overlap with these induced by BN108; both TAIII and BN108 inhibit mTORC1 in cancer cells and induce protective autophagy. Another major and more abundant timosaponin from BN108, TBII, could be enzymatically converted to TAIII by the removal of extra sugar, which unmasks its cytotoxicity. Since BN108, like most herbal extracts in TCM, is taken orally, it will be of interest to determine if TBII could be converted to active TAIII <italic>in vivo</italic> by glycosidases produced by intestinal microflora.</p><p>Perhaps not surprisingly, we found that both TAIII and BN108 elicit several different cellular responses, some of which were observed in all cells examined, and some that were selectively activated in tumor cells but not in the more resistant normal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007283-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). The interplay between cellular pathways that are differentially activated or inhibited by TAIII in different cells probably determines the fate of cells subjected to treatment. The strong inhibitory effect of TAIII on activity of mTORC1 was observed selectively in tumor cells. The mTORC1 is frequently inappropriately activated in cancer and is contributing to the transformed phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007283-Sabatini1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref> , and this could play a role in the increased sensitivity of certain cancer cells to TAIII . The precise mechanism of mTORC1 inhibition by TAIII remains to be determined, but it involves growth factor activated proliferative pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007283-g004">Figure 4B</xref>) and does not involve depletion of energy stores (ATP levels are not affected in cells treated with TAIII or BN108; data not shown). Some transcription changes induced by TAIII are indicative of amino acid starvation response (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0007283-t002">Table 2</xref>), that could contribute to inhibition of mTORC1. In any case, selective inhibition of mTORC1 and Akt in cancer cells versus non-transformed cells is very likely to contribute to the selective cytotoxicity of BN108 and TAIII.</p><p>mTORC1 is well known to keep autophagy in check <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007283-DiazTroya1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, and its inhibition could be a culprit in TAIII induced autophagy. However, inhibition of mTORC1 by TAIII in BT474 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007283-g003">Figure 3B</xref>) did not induce protective autophagy. One could hypothesize that BT474 might simply harbor a defect in a gene whose product plays a role in autophagy, but other cytotoxic treatment do induce autophagic response in BT474 (data not shown). At the same time, protective autophagy was induced by TAIII in MCF10A cells, where mTORC1 was not inhibited. This would indicate that TAIII could induce autophagy through cellular pathways other than mTORC1 inhibition.</p><p>Indeed, we have identified a second cellular response elicited by TAIII that could be a potent inducer of autophagy: ER stress, manifested in the induction of a number of ER stress markers, and, importantly, phosphorylation of eIF2&#x003b1;, the central node in the integrated stress responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007283-Mori1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. No eIF2&#x003b1; phosphorylation was detected in MCF10A cells, even though they show some transcriptional responses associated with ER stress (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0007283-t002">Table 2</xref>) and activate cholesterol biosynthesis pathway (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007283.s006">Figure S2</xref>).</p><p>Phosphorylation of eIF2&#x003b1; could promote a stress-resistant state as part of integrated stress responses (ISR), but could also promote apoptosis. It apparently correlates with apoptosis induction by TAIII in breast cancer cells. In MDAMB231 cells, a much more robust transcriptional ER stress response is seen than in BT474 cells (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0007283-t002">Table 2</xref>) indicating that the ER stress transcriptional program that should follow eIF2&#x003b1; phosphorylation is not completed in BT474. We have examined if salubrinal, a selective inhibitor of eIF2&#x003b1; de-phosphorylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007283-Boyce1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>, can influence the outcome of TAIII treatment, but salubrinal did not change the status of peIF2&#x003b1; or the extent of apoptosis in any of the cell lines including BT474 (not shown), indicating that dephosphorylation of eIF2&#x003b1; is not responsible for the relative weakness of ER stress responses in BT474.</p><p>In turn, the weak ER stress response of BT474 could be causative in the lack of induction of protective autophagy in these cells, and their increased sensitivity to TAIII. In particular, the lack of induction of GRP78 and a weak upregulation of ATF4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007283-g005">Figure 5</xref>) in BT474 could contribute to lack of autophagy since both these ER stress responders were shown to contribute to autophagy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007283-Li1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007283-Milani1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. It is also possible that the dual effects of TAIII on mTORC1 and ER make different contributions to induction of apoptosis versus protective autophagy in different cells. Our data also suggest that lack of significant cytotoxic activity of TAIII towards normal cells could be related to two notable differences in their responses compared to cancer cells: first, lack of mTORC1 inhibition; second, a significant role of autophagy in protecting nontransformed cells from TAIII (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007283-g005">Figure 5D</xref>).</p><p>The role of the observed induction of SREBP-2 and its target genes in TAIII cytotoxicity remains to be elucidated, though it is unlikely to be directly relevant to cell death, because SREBP-2 is induced in relatively resistant MCF10A cells. One possibility is that TAIII induces specific changes in ER cholesterol levels rather than large fluctuation in total cellular cholesterol. Even small changes in ER cholesterol content can trigger changes in the SREBP-2 status through activating protein SCAP and inhibitor INSIG-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007283-Radhakrishnan1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. The other intriguing possibility is based on the described antagonism between integrated stress response (ISR) and sterol-regulated gene expression in cells treated with selected ER stress inducing compounds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007283-Harding1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. In MDAMB231 cells the ER stress response is prominent (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0007283-t002">Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007283-g005">Figure 5</xref>) and SREBP activation is less pronounced (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0007283-t001">Table 1</xref>), while in BT474 markers of ER stress are either not induced or induced weakly (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0007283-t002">Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007283-g005">Figure 5</xref>), but SREBP-2 activation is very strong (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0007283-t001">Table 1</xref>). Harding et al. described this reciprocal relationship of the ISR and sterol-regulated gene expression and showed its dependence on eIF2&#x003b1; phosphorylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007283-Harding1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. Perhaps more surprisingly, in this work deletion of PERK, the only known ER stress responsive kinase that phosphorylates eIF2&#x003b1;, did not lead to the abrogation of eIF2&#x003b1; phosphorylation in cells treated with the compounds. We show that even though PERK is not phosphorylated in BT474 cells treated with TAIII, eIF2&#x003b1; is phosphorylated. Therefore, in BT474 cells a different mechanism, not involving PERK, might be responsible for activation of eIF2&#x003b1;. There are recent evidence that ER stress could induce phosphorylation of eIF2&#x003b1; by mechanisms independent of PERK <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007283-Carra1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>We have not observed induction of ROS that was recently described in HeLa cells subjected to treatment with TAIII <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007283-Sy1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. This difference between our observations and the previously reported results may stem from at least two potential sources: first, it could be related to the different concentrations of TAIII used. In the paper by Sy et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007283-Sy1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, IC50 of TAIII was close to 10 &#x000b5;M for HeLa cells after two day treatment, whereas the two breast cancer cell lines we have used were significantly more sensitive, with IC50 values of about 2.5 and 6 &#x000b5;M after 1 day. Second, and more important, the relatively modest increase in cellular ROS (about 30&#x02013;40&#x00025; over baseline) reported in HeLa cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007283-Sy1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref> was observed between 24 to 48 hours of treatment with TAIII. We examined the effects of BN108 and TAIII on mitochondria during the first 4&#x02013;6 hours of treatment with TAIII or BN108, and could not detect appreciable induction of ROS or dissipation of the mitochondrial membrane potential. At this time, however, inhibition of mTORC1 and phosphorylation of eIF2&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007283-g003">Figures 3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007283-g004"/><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007283-g005">5</xref>) were evident, indicating that these changes well precede the mitochondrial events. Mitochondrial degeneration could play a role in the TAIII induced death, but it would most likely occur as consequences of the other, described here, events triggered by TAIII earlier.</p><p>It is potentially important for the understanding of the mechanisms of TAIII cytotoxicity that both responses elicited by it in tumor cells, i.e. inhibition of mTORC1 and ER stress, induce autophagy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007283-HoyerHansen1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007283-Yorimitsu1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007283-DiazTroya1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. TAIII induced autophagy is protective in both tumor and normal cells, but the pro-apoptotic effects of the mTORC1 inhibition and ER stress appear to prevail in tumor cells. These results indicate that TAIII could be a promising candidate for drug development as a selective anti-cancer agent.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0007283.s001"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p>Expression changes induced in BT474 cells treated with BN108</p><p>(0.07 MB PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0007283.s001.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0007283.s002"><label>Table S2</label><caption><p>Expression analysis data of genes affected by TAIII in BT474, MDAMB231 and MCF10A cells</p><p>(0.10 MB PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0007283.s002.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0007283.s003"><label>Table S3</label><caption><p>Proteomic analysis of MDAMB231 cells treated with TAIII</p><p>(0.06 MB PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0007283.s003.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0007283.s004"><label>Methods S1</label><caption><p>Expression array analysis</p><p>(0.02 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0007283.s004.doc" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0007283.s005"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Activation of caspases 4 and 9 by BN108.
