NPM binds the Arf tumor suppressor and protects it from degradation. The AML-associated NPM mutant (NPMmut) also binds p19Arf but is unable to protect it from degradation, which suggests that inactivation of p19Arf contributes to leukemogenesis in AMLs. We report here that NPM regulates turnover of the c-Myc oncoprotein by acting on the F-box protein Fbw7&#x003b3;, a component of the E3 ligase complex involved in the ubiquitination and proteasome degradation of c-Myc. NPM was required for nucleolar localization and stabilization of Fbw7&#x003b3;. As a consequence, c-Myc was stabilized in cells lacking NPM. Expression of NPMmut also led to c-Myc stabilization because of its ability to interact with Fbw7&#x003b3; and delocalize it to the cytoplasm, where it is degraded. Because Fbw7 induces degradation of other growth-promoting proteins, the NPM&#x02013;Fbw7 interaction emerges as a central tumor suppressor mechanism in human cancer.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>P.G.

The underlying mechanisms, however, remain unknown.</p><p>NPM is a ubiquitously expressed nucleolar protein that functions as a molecular chaperone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Okuwaki et al., 2001</xref>) and shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Borer et al., 1989</xref>). It is part of a high&#x02013;molecular weight complex and physically interacts with many cellular proteins including p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Colombo et al., 2002</xref>), Mdm2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kurki et al., 2004</xref>), and Arf (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Itahana et al., 2003</xref>). NPM binds Arf and protects it from degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kuo et al., 2004</xref>). In <italic>NPM&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic> cells, the Arf protein looses its nucleolar localization and becomes markedly unstable, which suggests that NPM is required for correct localization and stability of Arf (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Colombo et al., 2005</xref>). This function of NPM is lost in mutant NPM (NPMmut), which contains a de novo nuclear export signal and mainly localizes in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mariano et al., 2006</xref>). NPMmut competes with wild-type (WT) NPM for Arf binding and targets Arf to the cytoplasm, where it becomes more susceptible to degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Colombo et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Preliminary evidence suggests, however, that NPM controls other intracellular pathways that negatively regulate cell proliferation. In <italic>NPM&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic> embryos, cells proliferate more actively, accumulate DNA damage, and undergo p53-dependent apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Colombo et al., 2005</xref>), a picture that is reminiscent of the DNA damage response induced by oncogene expression in primary cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bartkova et al., 2005</xref>). <italic>NPM&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic> cells also show aberrant mitotic figures with multiple centrosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Grisendi et al., 2005</xref>) and are more susceptible to transformation by activated oncogenes such as Myc and Ras (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Colombo et al., 2005</xref>).

Levels of <italic>c</italic>-<italic>myc</italic> mRNA, instead, were equivalent in the two samples (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 a</xref>, right), which suggests that the increased levels of c-Myc protein in the <italic>NPM&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic> embryos were caused by enhanced protein stability.

To measure the half-life of the c-Myc protein, dKO and control cells were treated with cycloheximide (CHX; an inhibitor of de novo protein synthesis widely used to measure c-Myc protein half-life; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Popov et al., 2007</xref>) and lysed at different time points to follow c-Myc protein degradation. As an internal control, we monitored expression of &#x003b3;-tubulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Colombo et al., 2005</xref>). WB in the <italic>p53&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic> MEFs confirmed that c-Myc is an unstable protein with a half-life of &#x0223c;20 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gregory and Hann, 2000</xref>). In the dKO cells, instead, the c-Myc protein appeared to be more stable, with a calculated half-life of &#x0223c;40 min (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 f</xref>). It appears, therefore, that NPM regulates stability of the c-Myc protein. To confirm the NPM dependency, we reconstituted NPM expression in dKO cells and measured levels of c-Myc protein, c-Myc protein stability, and c-Myc target gene expression. Notably, NPM reexpression in <italic>NPM&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic> MEFs reduced the half-life of the c-Myc protein (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 g</xref>, left; and <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 h</xref>), its steady-state and serum-stimulated levels (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 g</xref>, middle), and expression of c-Myc target genes after serum stimulation (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 g</xref>, right). Finally, to investigate the effects of p53 on c-Myc expression, we evaluated levels of <italic>c-myc</italic> mRNA/protein and c-Myc protein stability in WT and <italic>p53</italic>-null MEFs. As shown in Fig. S1 a (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200711040/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200711040/DC1</ext-link>), a lack of p53 led to increased levels of <italic>c-Myc</italic> mRNA and protein, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ho et al., 2005</xref>). Notably, however, the stability of the c-Myc protein was the same in the two cell types (Fig. S1 b). Down-regulation of NPM expression by siRNA induced up-regulation of c-Myc protein levels, but not of the corresponding mRNA, in both the WT and <italic>p53&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic> MEFs (Fig. S2 c), thus indicating that the effect of NPM silencing on c-Myc protein is p53 independent.</p><p>c-Myc is degraded through the ubiquitin&#x02013;proteasome pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Salghetti et al., 1999</xref>), and its ubiquitination is controlled by two different F-box proteins, Fbw7 and Skp2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hann, 2006</xref>). Three isoforms of Fbw7 have been described that differ in their intracellular localization: Fbw7&#x003b1; (nuclear diffuse), Fbw7&#x003b2; (cytoplasmic), and Fbw7&#x003b3; (nucleolar). Although all three Fbw7 isoforms have the potential to bind it, preliminary evidence suggests that c-Myc is prevalently degraded by Fbw7&#x003b3; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Popov et al., 2007</xref>). Because NPM localizes to the nucleolus (where it colocalizes with Fbw7&#x003b3;; Fig. S1 d), we investigated whether the Fbw7&#x003b3; isoform is involved in the regulation of c-Myc stability by NPM. The HA-tagged version of Fbw7&#x003b3; was overexpressed in dKO or p53&#x02212;/&#x02212; control cells previously engineered with a Myc&#x02013;estrogen receptor fusion protein (Myc-ER) whose activity is induced by treatment with 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT). Treatment of <italic>p53&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic> control cells with OHT rapidly induced nuclear translocation of Myc-ER (not depicted), its stabilization (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 a</xref>), and binding to target promoters (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 b</xref>). Overexpression of Fbw7&#x003b3; reduced Myc-ER protein stabilization and promoter occupancy in <italic>p53&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic> cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, a and b</xref>) but had no effects in dKO cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, a and b</xref>). The same experiments were repeated in the dKO and <italic>p53&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic> parental cells. Overexpression of Fbw7&#x003b3; slightly yet consistently reduced levels of endogenous c-Myc protein and c-Myc occupancy at target promoters in the p53&#x02212;/&#x02212; cells but not in dKO cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, c and d</xref>). It appears, therefore, that NPM expression is critical for the ability of Fbw7&#x003b3; to regulate c-Myc protein levels.</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>NPM is required for Fbw7&#x003b3; activity.</bold> (a) WB analysis in <italic>p53&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic> and dKO MEFs infected with Myc-ER and, where indicated (&#x0002b;), HA-Fbw7&#x003b3;&#x02013;expressing retroviruses.

Coimmuprecipitation experiments revealed that NPM forms a complex in vivo with ectopically expressed tagged Fbw7&#x003b3; (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 e</xref>, left). The interaction is likely to be direct, as recombinant GST-NPM bound in vitro translated Fbw7&#x003b3; (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 f</xref>). No interactions were detected between NPM and Fbw7&#x003b1; (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, e and f</xref>) or &#x003b2; (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 e</xref>).</p><p>Immunofluorescence (IF) analysis (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 a</xref>, top) showed that Fbw7&#x003b3; was concentrated in the nucleoli of <italic>p53&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic> cells, as expected. In dKO MEFs, the nucleolar localization of Fbw7&#x003b3; was lost, replaced by a diffuse nuclear staining. These alterations in localization were specific for the Fbw7&#x003b3; isoform because Fbw7&#x003b1; and Fbw7&#x003b2; showed unchanged localization patterns in dKO and control cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 a</xref>, bottom left and bottom right). Fbw7&#x003b3; levels in the dKO MEFs were also consistently lower than in the control <italic>p53&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic> MEFs (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 b</xref>, left), whereas mRNAs were comparable (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 b</xref>, right). CHX treatment revealed that the half-life of Fbw7&#x003b3; in <italic>p53&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic> MEFs was &#x0223c;80 min but was reduced in the dKO to &#x0223c;30 min (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 c</xref>). The half-life of Fbw7&#x003b3; protein was not influenced by expression of p53 (Fig. S1 e). Accordingly, Fbw7&#x003b3;&#x02212;dependent ubiquitination of c-Myc was reduced in NPM-null cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 d</xref>). Finally, we analyzed the ability of Fbw7&#x003b3; to inhibit c-Myc&#x02013;dependent transformation. Overexpression of Fbw7&#x003b3; induced a significant attenuation of the transformed phenotype in OHT-treated <italic>p53&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic>;Myc-ER cells, as shown by their reduced ability to form colonies in semisolid medium (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 e</xref>).

In summary, NPM positively regulates the nucleolar localization and stability of the Fbw7&#x003b3; protein and is essential for the ability of Fbw7 to promote c-Myc degradation and limit cell transformation. The effect of NPM on c-Myc protein stability appears to be specifically exerted through Fbw7&#x003b3;, as we found no effects of NPM on expression and localization of Skp2 (Fig. S1 f).</p><fig position="float" id="fig3"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>NPM is required Fbw7&#x003b3; nucleolar localization and stability.</bold> (a) IF analysis of Fbw7&#x003b3; (top), Fbw7&#x003b1; (bottom left), and Fbw7&#x003b2; (bottom right) localization in p53&#x02212;/&#x02212; and dKO MEFs transiently transfected with the corresponding flag-Fbw7 constructs (green staining).

Overexpression of c-Myc induces DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dominguez-Sola et al., 2007</xref>) and, in primary fibroblasts, a p53-dependent cellular checkpoint mainly characterized by a reduction of cell proliferation; when cells are grown in low serum, it also induces apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Zindy et al., 1998</xref>). Ectopic expression of the NPMmut in MEFs induced no modifications of Arf protein levels (Fig. S1 g), it increased the levels of &#x003b3;H2AX (a marker of DNA damage) and phosphorylated p53 (Fig. S1 g), decreased the proliferation rate, and, in low serum conditions, induced massive apoptosis (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 c</xref>). Together, these results suggest that apoptosis induced by NPMmut expression follows c-Myc stabilization, induction of DNA damage, and activation of p53.</p><p>We then investigated whether the effect of NPMmut on c-Myc stability is mediated by Fbw7&#x003b3;. The ability of overexpressed Fbw7&#x003b3; to down-regulate Myc-ER levels was completely lost in the presence of NPMmut expression (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 a</xref>). Moreover, in the presence of NPMmut, levels of Fbw7&#x003b3; protein were almost undetectable without changes of its mRNA (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 a</xref>). Treatment of the same cells with the MG132 proteasome inhibitor for 2 h was sufficient to reconstitute Fbw7&#x003b3; expression at levels similar to those observed in control cells without NPMmut (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 b</xref>). It appears, therefore, that NPMmut induces destabilization of Fbw7&#x003b3; and, as a consequence, stabilization of c-Myc.</p><fig position="float" id="fig5"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p><bold>Mutant NPM delocalizes and destabilizes Fbw7</bold>&#x003b3;.

Coimmunoprecipitation experiments in <italic>NPM</italic>-deficient MEFs revealed that NPMmut is able to form a complex with Fbw7&#x003b3; both in the absence (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 c</xref>) or presence (not depicted) of WT NPM. IF analysis of the intracellular localization of Fbw7&#x003b3; in <italic>p53&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic> and dKO showed that expression of NPMmut causes, in both cell types, a partial displacement of Fbw7&#x003b3; from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 d</xref> and Fig. S2 a, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200711040/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200711040/DC1</ext-link>). These results were confirmed by WB analysis of the levels of Fbw7&#x003b3; in nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions of <italic>p53&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic> and dKO cells in the presence or absence of NPMmut expression (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 e</xref> and Fig. S2 b). The ability of NPMmut to delocalize Fbw7&#x003b3; and to form a complex in cells also in the presence of the WT NPM suggest that NPMmut competes with the WT protein to bind Fbw7&#x003b3;. Consistently, we observed that up-regulation of c-Myc protein levels (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 a</xref>) and Myc-target gene expression (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 d</xref>) by NPMmut were facilitated in NPM&#x0002b;/&#x02212; MEFs, which carry reduced levels of NPM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Grisendi et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>To investigate if the cytoplasmic displacement of Fbw7&#x003b3; correlates with its degradation, we analyzed levels of the Fbw7&#x003b3; protein upon treatment of <italic>p53&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic> and dKO cells with the nuclear-export inhibitor leptomycin B (LMB) as compared with treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132. As shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 f</xref> and Fig. S2 c, LMB and MG132 increased the levels of Fbw7&#x003b3; to the same extent in both cell types. However, despite the fact that NPMmut induced degradation of Fbw7&#x003b3; in dKO cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 e</xref>), it did not increase c-Myc protein levels in the same cells, which is consistent with the observation that, in the absence of WT NPM, the function of Fbw7&#x003b3; is lost, regardless of its nuclear or cytoplasmic localization (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, a&#x02013;c</xref>). These data are consistent with the reported chaperone activity of WT NPM in maintaining the proper folding and activity of its interactors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Szebeni and Olson, 1999</xref>). In summary, we observed that expression of NPMmut induces delocalization and accelerated degradation of Fbw7&#x003b3; also in the absence of the WT NPM protein, thus demonstrating that the effect of the mutant NPM on Fbw7&#x003b3; is direct. Furthermore, because LMB treatment induced nuclear relocalization of NPMmut and Fbw7&#x003b3; and restoration of physiological levels of Fbw7&#x003b3; protein, aberrant cytoplasmic localization of the NPMmut appears critical for the degradation of Fbw7&#x003b3;.</p><p>In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that NPM regulates c-Myc protein stability through its effect on the &#x003b3;-isoform of the F-box E3 ubiquitin ligase Fbw7. They are consistent with a model whereby NPM binds directly to Fbw7&#x003b3; and serves as a molecular chaperone to ensure its proper folding, nucleolar localization, and to prevent its degradation. This effect of NPM on Fbw7&#x003b3; is relevant for the regulation of one of its substrates, c-Myc, which, in fact, accumulates in the absence of NPM.</p><p>The effect of NPM on Fbw7 regulation, however, might be more complex. Other intracellular proteins are also Fbw7-substrates, including Notch, cyclin E, and c-Jun (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Nakayama and Nakayama, 2005</xref>). Because NPM does not regulate the Fbw7&#x003b1; and Fbw7&#x003b2; isoforms, it might allow regulation of Fbw7&#x003b3;-specific substrates or the nucleolar site of degradation of Fbw7-common substrates. Close inspection of the regulation of Notch, cyclin E, and c-Jun protein stability and function in <italic>NPM&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic> cells might help to elucidate this question.</p><p>The leukemia-associated mutant of NPM interacts with Fbw7&#x003b3; and delocalizes it to the cytoplasm, thus favoring its degradation. As a consequence, c-Myc protein levels are increased in cells expressing the NPMmut. Notably, c-Myc protein is frequently overexpressed in AMLs and stabilized in several leukemia cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hoffman et al., 2002</xref>), and c-Myc overexpression favors myeloid leukemogenesis in mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Luo et al., 2005</xref>). Thus, the pathway of c-Myc degradation is relevant for human cancer, which suggests that elevated c-Myc protein expression might contribute to leukemogenesis in the NPMmut AMLs.</p><p>Oncogene-induced hyperproliferation activates an Arf- and p53-dependent intracellular checkpoint that leads to cell cycle arrest or apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Di Micco et al., 2006</xref>). Remarkably, the NPMmut also favors Arf degradation, which suggests that in AMLs, a single genetic mutation might have the double effect of activating proliferation and attenuating the resulting checkpoint response. This would probably result in accelerated leukemogenesis and reduced pressure for accumulation of further genetic abnormalities. Interestingly, AMLs with NPMmut usually have normal karyotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Falini et al., 2005</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>qChIP and quantitative PCR (QPCR) analysis</title><p>MEFs were grown and processed for qChIP analysis as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Frank et al., 2001</xref>) using anti-Myc (N-262; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) antibodies.
