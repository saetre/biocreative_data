Gemin5 was readily purified by cap-affinity chromatography in contrast to other SMN complex proteins. Investigating the underlying basis for this observation, we found that purified gemin5 associates with m<sup>7</sup>G-linked sepharose in the absence of detectable eIF4E, and specifically crosslinks to radiolabeled cap structure after UV irradiation. Deletion analysis revealed that an intact set of WD repeat domains located in the N-terminal half of gemin5 are required for cap-binding. Moreover, using structural modeling and site-directed mutagenesis, we identified two proximal aromatic residues located within the WD repeat region that significantly impact m<sup>7</sup>G association.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>This study rigorously identifies gemin5 as a novel cap-binding protein and describes an unprecedented role for WD repeat domains in m<sup>7</sup>G recognition.

In metazoans a two-component enzyme complex engendering triphosphatase, guanylyltransferase, and methyltransferase enzymatic activities is responsible for modifying RNAs at the 5&#x02032; end with m<sup>7</sup>G <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007030-Shuman1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. These critical functions are conserved in fungi and the human capping system can replace that of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007030-Saha1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. The nuclear capping reaction serves as an important checkpoint for RNA quality control. Multiple studies have documented that efficient pre-mRNA splicing and polyadenylation depend upon an intact 5&#x02032; cap <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007030-Konarska1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007030-Proudfoot1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, the cap structure is an important determinant of mRNA stability in both the nucleus and cytoplasm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007030-Wilusz1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Functions attributed to the cap depend upon specific trans-acting factors that have been shown to directly bind m<sup>7</sup>G. In the nucleus a bipartite cap-binding complex (CBC) composed of CBP20 and CBP80 associates with nascent pre-mRNAs to promote splicing and export <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007030-Izaurralde1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007030-Izaurralde2">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. After gaining access to the cytoplasm, mRNPs are remodeled to produce translation-competent particles. This process minimally involves exchange of the CBC for eukaryotic initiation factor (eIF) 4E, the predominantly cytoplasmic cap-binding protein responsible for directing the initiation phase of translation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007030-Sonenberg1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007030-Sonenberg2">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Subsequent to translation, the cap plays an important role in determining the end of an mRNA's existence. Once cytoplasmic mRNA is deadenylated, irreversible decapping by DCP2 complexed with DCP1 results in rapid decay of the transcript body <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007030-Simon1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, the m<sup>7</sup>G cap moiety participates in every major aspect of mRNA metabolism.</p><p>In addition to mRNAs, RNA pol II mediates the synthesis of multiple non-coding RNAs including the Sm class of small nuclear (sn) RNAs composed of eight unique species: U1, U2, U4, U4<sub>atac</sub>, U5, U7, U11, and U12 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007030-Matera1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. These snRNAs are also modified co-transcriptionally with a 5&#x02032; m<sup>7</sup>G cap, but 3&#x02032; end processing is carried out by distinct machinery that generates mature non-polyadenylated termini. Similar to mRNAs, newly synthesized Sm class snRNAs are bound by CBC which, along with the adaptor protein PHAX <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007030-Ohno1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, facilitates export to the cytoplasm where snRNAs undergo further maturation.</p><p>Eukaryotes have evolved macromolecular protein complexes of varying complexity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007030-Kroiss1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref> that are responsible for cytoplasmic assembly of snRNPs. In humans the survival of motor neuron (SMN) complex mediates the assembly and specific deposition of heptameric Sm cores on the conserved Sm site (<named-content content-type="gene">5&#x02032;-AUUU/CUUG-3&#x02032;</named-content>) within snRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007030-Fischer1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007030-Battle1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007030-Pellizzoni1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007030-Meister1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition to SMN protein, the SMN complex is constituted by at least seven factors known as gemins. The largest component of the SMN complex is gemin5, a &#x0223c;170 kDa WD repeat-containing protein that is conserved among vertebrates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007030-Meister1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007030-Gubitz1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Like other SMN complex members, gemin5 is predominantly cytoplasmic but may also localize to distinct sub-nuclear foci known as gems or Cajal bodies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007030-Cioce1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. Gemin5 has been implicated as the SMN constituent that confers specificity to the SMN complex for Sm class snRNA substrates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007030-Battle1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. This specificity depends upon recognition by gemin5 of the &#x0201c;snRNP code&#x0201d; which consists of the Sm site and at least one 3&#x02032; proximal stem-loop <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007030-Golembe1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, a significant fraction of cytoplasmic gemin5 appears to exist free of the SMN complex or in a sub-complex with gemin3 and gemin4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007030-Battle2">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. Gemin5 also uniquely dissociates from the SMN complex under conditions of high salinity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007030-Otter1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, gemin5 may be considered a peripheral component of the SMN complex.</p><p>Subsequent to Sm core assembly, the snRNA cap is hypermethylated by the TGS1 methyltransferase to form 2,2,7-trimethylguanosine (TMG) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007030-Mattaj1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007030-Mouaikel1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. The import factor snurportin directly recognizes the TMG cap <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007030-Huber1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref> and, in cooperation with SMN <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007030-Narayanan1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, directs nuclear import of the assembled snRNP for final maturation steps before assembly into active spliceosomes. Hence, as with mRNA metabolism, the 5&#x02032; cap is essential for biogenesis of snRNAs.</p><p>While it is well established that capping of RNA pol II transcripts with m<sup>7</sup>G is critical for their metabolism, it is not clear whether the full complement of cellular proteins capable of binding the cap structure has been defined. Here, we present evidence that gemin5 is capable of direct and specific interaction with m<sup>7</sup>G in a manner that depends upon integrity of its WD repeat domains. These findings expand the repertoire of identified cellular m<sup>7</sup>G cap-binding proteins and raise the possibility that gemin5 is a novel regulator of gene expression at the post-transcriptional level.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Gemin5 is specifically purified by cap-affinity chromatography</title><p>Efficient isolation of cap-binding complexes from cell lysates can be achieved using m<sup>7</sup>GTP immobilized to sepharose by covalent linkage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007030-Webb1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. Cap-sepharose is widely used to investigate interaction between eIF4E and its binding partners. Chief among these is the scaffolding protein eIF4G, which is believed to mediate ribosomal recruitment through interaction with eIF3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007030-Lamphear1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007030-Pestova1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>.

Under the binding conditions employed here (see experimental procedures), the abundant poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) was not detectable in cap-resin precipitates and thus served as an input control. Cap-affinity chromatography performed in the presence of various reagents (GpppG, ATP, m<sup>7</sup>GpppG, RNase A) indicated robust stringency of the purification method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007030-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). In particular, addition of free m<sup>7</sup>GpppG to binding reactions prevented eIF4E precipitation while unmethylated cap analog (GpppG) had no effect, demonstrating strict binding specificity of eIF4E to methylated guanosine. As with GpppG, supplementation of reactions with ATP or treatment of lysate with RNase did not affect eIF4E precipitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007030-g001">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0007030-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0007030.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Characterization of proteins purified by cap-affinity chromatography.</title><p>(A) HeLa cytoplasmic lysate was applied to m<sup>7</sup>G-sepharose 4B or sepharose 4B alone.

Analysis of precipitates shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007030-g001">figure 1B</xref> by silver stain indicated the presence of five proteins migrating between 55 and 200 kDa whose abundances were specifically reduced by free m<sup>7</sup>GpppG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007030-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). The quantity of a &#x0223c;100 kDa protein increased substantially as a consequence of RNase treatment, suggesting that disruption of endogenous RNPs allows more efficient purification of this factor. These proteins were subsequently isolated in a separate purification and analyzed by mass spectrometry. This analysis revealed the identities of these proteins as importin-&#x003b1;, CBP80, gemin4, gemin5, and eIF4G (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007030-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). CBP80 and eIF4G were expected constituents of cap-binding complexes. Additionally, importin-&#x003b1; is a known interaction partner of the CBC that mediates its nuclear import subsequent to release of the CBC's RNA cargo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007030-Gorlich1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. However, the presence of SMN complex components, gemin4 and gemin5, was unexpected.</p><p>The pattern of proteins purified by cap-affinity was also examined using lysates from cells acutely stressed with arsenite or infected with coxsackievirus B3 (CBV3). CBV3 encodes a protease (2A<sup>pro</sup>) that cleaves eIF4G downstream of the eIF4E interaction site <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007030-Lloyd1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. This resulted in markedly reduced purification of intact eIF4G and corresponding precipitation of &#x0223c;100 kDa N-terminal fragments that retain the ability to interact with eIF4E (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007030-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). A protein band corresponding in size to eIF4A was also expectedly absent, since the C-terminal eIF4G fragment produced by 2A<sup>pro</sup> harbors eIF4A-binding sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007030-Lamphear1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007030-Imataka1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. Isolation of other factors was unaffected by CBV3 infection. Short-term arsenite exposure to induce oxidative stress did not modify the pattern of protein pull-down, but appeared to result in elevated CBP80 purification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007030-g001">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p>Since RNase treatment significantly enhanced gemin4 recovery by cap-affinity without affecting gemin5 pull-down, we reasoned that gemin4 isolation was secondary to its binding partner gemin5, and thus focused our study on the latter. In order to confirm mass spectrometric findings, we generated cDNA clones for transient over-expression of tagged gemin5 and eIF4E proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007030-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). As with the corresponding endogenous factors, C-terminally FLAG-tagged gemin5 and N-terminally myc-tagged eIF4E co-expressed in 293T cells both specifically precipitated on cap-sepharose but not sepharose alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007030-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). We also examined the levels of endogenous gemin5 and its binding partners gemin3 and gemin4 in cap-affinity chromatography by western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007030-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). As expected, endogenous gemin5 was present in precipitates, but comparatively little gemin4 was purified and gemin3 was undetectable. This suggests that the predominant form of gemin5 purified by cap-affinity is not bound to gemin3/4 or the SMN complex. Interestingly, we consistently observed that only a fraction of endogenous or over-expressed gemin5 was precipitated with cap-resin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007030-g002">Figures 2B</xref> and2C; compare levels in &#x0201c;input&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;supe&#x0201d; lanes), whereas eIF4E was efficiently depleted from lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007030-g001">Figures 1A, 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007030-g002">2B</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0007030-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0007030.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Gemin5 isolated by cap-affinity is not bound to the SMN complex.</title><p>(A) Schematic representation of gemin5 and eIF4E indicating locations of WD repeats, the putative coiled coil domain, and epitope tags.

Strikingly, mutation of amino acid 286 abolished association with cap sepharose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007030-g006">Figure 6C</xref>), indicating that this tryptophan is critical for interaction with both m<sup>7</sup>G and U4 snRNA.</p><p>Structural characterizations of several viral and eukaryotic cap-binding proteins have demonstrated that association with m<sup>7</sup>G significantly depends upon aromatic residues that stack on either side of the guanine base (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">discussion</xref>). Since W286 is critical for gemin5's ability to recognize m<sup>7</sup>G, we hypothesized that a second aromatic residue within the vicinity of position 286 might participate in cap-binding. Similarly to Lau et al., we utilized PHYRE to identify predicted locations of aromatic residues that are both solvent-exposed and located within 8 &#x000c5; of W286. This distance was selected because the solved structures of eIF4E and CBP20 reveal interplanar distances between m<sup>7</sup>G and aromatic side chains to be &#x0223c;3.5 &#x000c5;.

In contrast, the F338A variant exhibited significantly reduced association with cap-sepharose compared to either wild-type gemin5 or the F304A construct but, unlike W286A, was still detectable in cap precipitates. These findings indicate that F338 and W286 are important for cap recognition by gemin5 and suggest these residues may participate in stacking interactions with m<sup>7</sup>G as in structurally-characterized cap-binding proteins.

Each of these proteins bind the cap structure via conserved aromatic side chains that stack on either side of m<sup>7</sup>G, forming a cap &#x0201c;sandwich&#x0201d;. We investigated the molecular determinants responsible for gemin5 interaction with m<sup>7</sup>G. Deletion analysis revealed that integrity of the 13 WD repeats present in the N-terminal half of gemin5 are important for cap-binding, indicating an unprecedented structural association between the propeller-like platforms known to be formed by tandemly-arrayed WD repeats and the cap-binding motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007030-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Moreover, structural modeling using the PHYRE algorithm combined with site-directed mutagenesis putatively identified unique aromatic amino acids (W286 and F338; located in the 5<sup>th</sup> and 6<sup>th</sup> WD repeats, respectively) that may directly mediate cap interaction similar to previously characterized cap-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007030-g006">Figure 6</xref>). However, the possibility that gemin5 associates with the cap structure via an alternative mode cannot be ruled out.

The PHYRE analysis also suggested an integral role for involvement of the N-terminal 25 residues in the structure of the first &#x003b2;-propeller. In particular, this region is predicted to compose the first &#x003b2;-strand of the N-terminal WD repeat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007030-g006">Figure 6A</xref>), and deletion of these amino acids may have broad destabilizing effects that preclude specific recognition of m<sup>7</sup>G.</p><p>In contrast to eIF4E, cap-affinity chromatography consistently failed to significantly deplete gemin5 from cell lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007030-g001">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007030-g002">2</xref>). One possible explanation for this finding is that the steady-state affinity of gemin5 for the cap is significantly lower compared to that of eIF4E. On the other hand, gemin5's cap-binding capability may be negatively regulated by interaction with its partner protein(s).

The eIF4E clone was established by RT-PCR amplification of HeLa total RNA and the PCR fragment was inserted into pcDNA 3.1 containing a myc-tag <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007030-Kaiser1">&#x0005b;62&#x0005d;</xref>. N-terminally FLAG-tagged Ago2 in pcDNA 3.1 was derived by standard methods from a cDNA clone (ATCC; RefSeq:NM_012154). All clones were sequenced to ensure correctness. Transfection of expression plasmids for IP or cap-pull down experiments was performed with 293T cells grown on 10 cm dishes. Cells were transfected with 10 &#x000b5;g DNA and 40 &#x000b5;l lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Twenty-four hours later cells were harvested and lysed as described above.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Structural modeling</title><p>The PHYRE program <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007030-Kelley1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref> was used to model the WD repeat domain structure of gemin5 as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007030-Lau1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>.
