Mouse ADAS cells cultured in media formulated for neural stem cells (NSC) displayed limited capacity for self-renewal, clonogenicity, and neurosphere formation compared to NSC from the subventricular zone in the hippocampus. Although ADAS cells expressed Nestin, GFAP, NSE and Tuj1 <italic>in vitro</italic>, exposure to NSC differentiation supplements did not induce mature neuronal marker expression. In contrast, in mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) media, ADAS cells retained their ability to proliferate and differentiate beyond 20 passages and expressed high levels of Nestin. In neuritizing cocktails, ADAS cells extended processes, downregulated Nestin expression, and displayed depolarization-induced Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> transients but no spontaneous or evoked neural network activity on Multi-Electrode Arrays. Deletion of Notch 1 in ADAS cell cultures grown in NSC proliferation medium did not significantly alter their proliferative potential <italic>in vitro</italic> or the differentiation-induced downregulation of Nestin. Co-culture of ADAS cells with fibroblasts that stably expressed the Notch ligand Jagged 1 or overexpression of the Notch intracellular domain (NICD) did not alter ADAS cell growth, morphology, or cellular marker expression. ADAS cells did not display robust expression of neural crest transcription factors or genes (Sox, CRABP2, and TH); and lineage tracing analyses using Wnt1&#x02013;Cre;Rosa26R-lacZ or -EYFP reporter mice confirmed that fewer than 2&#x00025; of the ADAS cell population derived from a Wnt1-positive population during development. In summary, although media formulations optimized for MSCs or NSCs enable expansion of mouse ADAS cells <italic>in vitro,</italic> we find no evidence that these cells are of neural crest origin, that they can undergo robust terminal differentiation into functionally mature neurons, and that Notch 1 is likely to be a key regulator of their cellular and molecular characteristics.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neurodegenerative diseases are difficult to treat because damaged neurons in the central nervous system (CNS) have a limited capacity for regeneration and repair compared to neurons in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) or tissues in other organs (e.g. liver). Therefore, efforts to identify suitable tissue sources to replace lost neuronal populations or aid in the regeneration of CNS pathways has intensified. The use of embryonic stem (ES) cells for clinical applications is limited at present by the low efficiency with which these can be differentiated into functional neurons <italic>in vitro</italic>, the tumorigenic potential of ES cells that escape differentiation, and the need for immunosuppression of the host. In theory, neural stem cells would be the ideal choice for cell replacement, but they are limited in number and difficult to access for autologous cell transplantation.</p><p>It has been suggested that the readily accessible adipose-derived adult stromal (ADAS) cells of mesenchymal origin may represent a source of adult stem cells with neurogenic potential because they have the capacity to extend neuritic processes and express protein markers characteristic of neural stem cells <italic>in vitro</italic> in response to neuritizing cocktails <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001453-Zuk1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001453-Safford2">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>.

ADAS cell cultures were established from fat pads isolated from mice harboring a floxed Notch 1 (fN1) allele. No significant difference in gross morphology or proliferation kinetics was observed between wild type and fN1 mouse ADAS cells (data not shown). Upon confluence of the initial cell plating (P0), neurosphere-like cells as well as adherent cells were passaged (P1) and maintained in culture as separate populations. Neurosphere-like clusters of cells floating in the supernatant and cells derived from the adherent stromal faction were transduced with lentivirus vectors (See Methods) driving expression of wild-type Cre recombinase or a catalytically inactive mutant Cre (delta Cre). Both expression constructs contained an internal ribosome entry site (IRES) upstream of an EGFP gene allowing for convenient identification of transduced cells using green fluorescence. Formation of secondary and tertiary neurosphere-like clusters in fN1 ADAS cells infected with lenti-Cre, lenti-mutant Cre, or mock-infected was monitored for several passages and found to be the same under all experimental conditions (data not shown). Neurosphere-like clusters were dissociated into a single-cell suspension and FACS-sorted based on GFP fluorescence. GFP&#x02013;negative cells were retained in addition to GFP-positive cells to serve as untransduced controls. Cells were expanded to passage 2 and 3 following sorting by FACS and plated into Medium A or Medium C for studies of proliferative capacity and neural marker expression.
