Vascular <italic>B4galnt2</italic> expression results in aberrant glycosylation of von Willebrand Factor (VWF) and accelerated VWF clearance from plasma. We now report that 13 inbred mouse strains share the <italic>Mvwf1</italic> tissue-specific switch and low VWF phenotype, including five wild-derived strains. Genomic sequencing identified a highly conserved 97-kb <italic>Mvwf1</italic> haplotype block shared by these strains that encompasses a 30-kb region of high nucleotide sequence divergence from C57BL6/J flanking <italic>B4galnt2</italic> exon 1. The analysis of a series of bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) transgenes containing <italic>B4galnt2</italic> derived from the RIIIS/J or C57BL6/J inbred mouse strains demonstrates that the corresponding sequences are sufficient to confer the vessel (RIIIS/J) or intestine (C57BL6/J)-specific expression patterns. Taken together, our data suggest that the region responsible for the <italic>Mvwf1</italic> regulatory switch lies within an approximately 30-kb genomic interval upstream of the <italic>B4galnt2</italic> gene. The observation that <italic>Mvwf1</italic> is present in multiple wild-derived strains suggests that this locus may be retained in wild mouse populations due to positive selection. Similar selective pressures could contribute to the high prevalence of von Willebrand disease in humans.</p><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1007/s00335-007-9079-4) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2008</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-wrap></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>The RIIIS/J inbred mouse strain carries a spontaneous gain-of-function mutation that specifically switches the expression of &#x003b2;1,4-<italic>N</italic>-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase, B4GALNT2 (previously referred to as GALGT2), from the intestinal epithelial pattern seen in most mice to a vascular endothelial cell-specific pattern. Endothelial cell expression of B4GALNT2 leads to aberrant post-translational modification of endothelial-derived von Willebrand Factor (VWF) with subterminal GalNAc residues, resulting in accelerated clearance and low circulating VWF levels. This unique regulatory mutation was termed <italic>Mvwf1</italic>, for <italic>Modifier of VWF 1</italic> (Mohlke et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">1999</xref>).</p><p>Glycosyltransferases serve a critical role in post-translational modification of proteins and are generally either spatially or temporally restricted in their expression programs (Lowe and Marth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2003</xref>). Up to 1% of mammalian genes are involved in glycosylation, and 16 human congenital disorders of coagulation have been described, several of which affect coagulation (Haltiwanger and Lowe <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2004</xref>; Marquardt and Denecke <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2003</xref>). The physiologic function of the murine <italic>B4galnt2</italic> gene and its human ortholog, <italic>B4GALNT2</italic>, are unknown (Montiel et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2003</xref>), and <italic>B4galnt2</italic> knockout animals are viable and have no discernable phenotype under laboratory conditions (Lowe and Marth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2003</xref>). Several spontaneous mutations altering the tissue specificity of a given gene&#x02019;s expression have been reported, generally resulting in either a change in developmental timing (Crossley et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">1992</xref>; Cunningham and Jane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">1996</xref>) or a shift from a spatially restricted to a more generalized pattern of expression (Bedell et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">1995</xref>; Duhl et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">1994</xref>; Duttlinger et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">1993</xref>). To our knowledge, <italic>Mvwf1</italic> is the only reported example of a regulatory mutation resulting in a switch in gene expression program from one tissue-specific pattern to another restricted tissue-specific pattern.</p><p>Dolichos biflorus (DBA) lectin detects terminal nonreducing GalNAc residues such as those generated by <italic>B4galnt2</italic>. We previously demonstrated that DBA lectin detects the <italic>Mvwf1</italic> switch in the <italic>B4galnt2</italic> gene expression program from intestine to vessel (Mohlke et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">1999</xref>). Ponder and Wilkinson (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">1983</xref>) surveyed DBA lectin staining patterns in ten inbred mouse strains, including RIII/Ro, an ancestor of the RIIIS/J inbred mouse strain. They described two distinct staining patterns, the first an intestinal epithelial-specific pattern present in eight of the strains surveyed (including C57BL/6) and the second a vascular endothelial-specific pattern in the inbred strains DDK and RIII/Ro. Ponder et&#x000a0;al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">1985</xref>) subsequently expanded the DBA lectin survey and detected the RIII/Ro pattern in 3 of 29 strains.</p><p>We now report the analysis of sequences surrounding the <italic>B4galnt2</italic> gene from mice exhibiting the vascular endothelial-specific or gastrointestinal epithelial-specific <italic>B4galnt2</italic> expression programs. Our data suggest that the region responsible for the unique <italic>Mvwf1</italic> regulatory mutation likely lies within a 30-kb interval upstream of the <italic>B4galnt2</italic> structural gene. We identify a number of unrelated inbred mouse strains, including several wild-derived strains, that carry the same <italic>Mvwf1</italic> allele, suggesting that this locus may be under positive selection.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Animals</title><p>C57BL6/J, CASA/RkJ, LEWES/EiJ, PERA/EiJ, PERC/EiJ, RIIIS/J, RF/J, Sf/CamEiJ, SWR/J, and WSB/EiJ males 5-8 weeks old were obtained from The Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME).

Nine <italic>Mvwf1</italic> strains and wild-derived inbred strains from the <italic>M. musculus</italic> clade (Tucker <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2007</xref>), <italic>M. spretus</italic>, and <italic>M. spicilegus</italic> were included in this analysis. All nine of the <italic>Mvwf1</italic> strains surveyed were found to share a unique, highly conserved common haplotype block spanning the entire region that was distinct from all other strains tested (represented in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>; amplicons with <italic>Mvwf1</italic> SNPs are yellow; the haplotype block is outlined by the solid black box). Refinement of the haplotype data effort by sampling sequence from ten additional regions (5 upstream and 5 downstream) determined that the shared <italic>Mvwf1</italic> haplotype block is approximately 97kb in length and encompasses the entire upstream intergenic region and most of the <italic>B4galnt2</italic> structural gene.

To determine if these shared regions affect <italic>B4galnt2</italic> tissue-specific expression, DBA lectin staining was performed on bowel from strains representative of each candidate recombined haplotype pattern (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). MOLF/EiJ (Strain ID #37) and Id12b (Strain ID #28) both exhibit a wild-type gut(+), vessel(&#x02212;) pattern, suggesting that the genomic region responsible for the <italic>Mvwf1</italic> tissue-specific switch in <italic>B4galnt2</italic> gene expression program lies upstream of the <italic>B4galnt2</italic> structural gene and proximal promoter region (boundary indicated in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> by the black dashed line within the <italic>Mvwf1</italic> haplotype block). DBA lectin staining was absent in both bowel and vessel in WSB/EiJ (Strain ID #64), suggesting the presence of an independent <italic>B4galtnt2</italic> loss-of-function mutation on this allele. <fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p><italic>Mvwf1</italic> haplotype block.

Examples of regulatory mutations in other genes have been previously reported, which change either temporal or spatial gene expression programs. Although large genomic rearrangements such as those resulting from chromosome translocations can also result in tissue-specific switches in gene expression programs by moving genes from their native genomic context to another differentially regulated locus, previous work (Mohlke et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">1999</xref>) and our current data exclude such a large genomic rearrangement as a mechanism for the <italic>Mvwf1</italic> switch. In humans, diseases such as hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin (Cunningham and Jane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">1996</xref>) can result from mutations that alter the timing of gene expression during development, although tissue specificity generally remains unchanged. Spontaneous mutations have been reported in mice that specifically decrease gene expression in the &#x0201c;normal&#x0201d; tissue while upregulating gene expression in other tissues, including examples such as the <italic>W-sash</italic> allele affecting c-kit (Duttlinger et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">1993</xref>) and the <italic>Steel-contrasted</italic> allele of the melanocyte growth factor gene (Bedell et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">1995</xref>). However, in these cases the gene expression pattern has been changed from a restricted tissue-specific pattern to a more ubiquitous pattern of gene expression. In contrast, the <italic>Mvwf1</italic> regulatory mutation results in a unique switch in gene expression program from one tissue-specific pattern to another entirely distinct tissue-specific expression program.</p><p>Previous work demonstrated that <italic>Mvwf1</italic> results from a <italic>cis-</italic>acting mutation (Mohlke et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">1999</xref>) genetically localized to a large 264-kb genomic interval surrounding the <italic>B4galnt2</italic> gene and containing nine flanking genes (Mohlke et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">1996</xref>). Although the use of alternative tissue-specific promoters has been described as a mechanism for regulating tissue-specific gene expression (Morishita et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">1995</xref>), 5&#x02032;-RACE analysis appears to exclude this explanation for the <italic>Mvwf1</italic> regulatory switch. Taken together, the BAC expression data and multiple-strain analyses reported here (summarized in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) refine the candidate interval for the <italic>Mvwf1</italic> regulatory mutation from the previous 264-kb genomic segment to a 30-kb intergenic region upstream of the <italic>B4galnt2</italic> structural gene. These results position the candidate region for the <italic>Mvwf1</italic> regulatory mutation well outside of the <italic>B4galnt2</italic> structural gene and proximal promoter region and suggest that the <italic>Mvwf1</italic> mutation alters the function of one or more enhancer and/or repressor elements acting over a large genomic distance. <fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;4</label><caption><p>Summary of the <italic>Mvwf1</italic> candidate region.

This degree of sequence divergence is 3- to 30-fold greater than the sequence difference expected between modern laboratory strains (Wade et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2002</xref>). This 30-kb segment lies within a conserved 97-kb haplotype block shared by all 13 inbred mouse strains shown to exhibit the <italic>Mvwf1</italic> switch in DBA lectin staining pattern from bowel to vessel first described by Ponder and Wilkinson (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">1983</xref>). Our data identify the cause of the <italic>Mvwf1</italic> tissue-specific switch in the <italic>B4galnt2</italic> gene expression program (and the resulting low circulating VWF levels) as a single, highly conserved <italic>Mvwf1</italic> founder allele that is common among inbred laboratory mouse strains. Six of these <italic>Mvwf1</italic> strains were included in a survey of coagulation parameters as part of the Mouse Phenome Database project (Peters and Barker <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2006</xref>), accounting for six of the seven longest activated partial thromboplastin times (aPTTs) reported in the database (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>). Thus, <italic>Mvwf1</italic> is a common allele among inbred mouse strains and the major cause of a prolonged aPTT in laboratory mice. <fig id="Fig5"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;5</label><caption><p>Mouse Phenome Database: aPTT data.

Indeed, several of the <italic>Mvwf1</italic> strains reported here are wild-derived mouse strains that were created and maintained independent from conventional inbred laboratory mouse strains, supporting the persistence of <italic>Mvwf1</italic> specifically in the wild <italic>M. m. domesticus</italic> populations from which these wild-derived strains are descended (LEWES/EiJ was derived from founders trapped in Delaware, PERA/EiJ and PERC/EiJ from Peru, Sf/CamEiJ from California, and WSA from Maryland). The identification of <italic>Mvwf1</italic> in two independent and recently derived outbred wild mouse colonies from Idaho suggests that the <italic>Mvwf1</italic> allele continues to be maintained in contemporary wild mouse populations.</p><p>The existence of such a highly divergent, polymorphic genomic segment within a single species is quite unusual and raises interesting questions about the genetic origin of the <italic>Mvwf1</italic> allele. Although there are differences in the sizes of tandem repeats within this region between the <italic>Mvwf1</italic> strains, <italic>Mvwf1</italic> single nucleotide differences are nearly perfectly conserved. The conservation of single nucleotide differences is also shared by the wild-derived <italic>Mvwf1</italic> mouse strains. The existence of this highly conserved region within <italic>M. m. domesticus</italic> could be the result of selection, of suppression of recombination, or of a founder event. Indeed, the presence of a genomic region of such high nucleotide divergence is suggestive of balancing selection at or near this locus (Charlesworth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2006</xref>). Alternatively, this divergent segment could have arisen as the result of an introgression event from a closely related species such as other members of the genus <italic>Mus</italic> (Lundrigan et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2002</xref>). There is evidence that fragments of genomic DNA can be exchanged between mammalian species, including <italic>M. spretus</italic>, which is sympatric with <italic>M. m. domesticus</italic> (Hardies et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2000</xref>; Orth et&#x000a0;al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2002</xref>). A recently introduced foreign allele would be expected to have had less time to accrue sequence changes and could account for the large size of the <italic>Mvwf1</italic> haplotype block. If the <italic>Mvwf1</italic> divergent region is the result of an introgression event, then the species from which this allele was originally derived might also exhibit the phenotype conferred by the <italic>Mvwf1</italic> regulatory mutation.</p><p>Regardless of its origin, the presence of the highly conserved <italic>Mvwf1</italic> haplotype block among multiple, independent, wild-derived inbred strains, the diversity in geographic location and temporal spacing of capture of the original wild-derived strain founder mice, and the presence of the <italic>Mvwf1</italic> allele in recently derived outbred mouse colonies are all consistent with the maintenance of the <italic>Mvwf1</italic> allele as a natural variant in wild <italic>M. m. domesticus</italic> populations. Taken together, these data suggest the possibility that the <italic>Mvwf1</italic> phenotype may confer a fitness advantage, resulting in selective pressure that accounts for the prevalence of the <italic>Mvwf1</italic> allele in wild mouse populations. Even if additional evidence for natural selection can be obtained, the underlying mechanism may be difficult to precisely define. A direct effect of reduced plasma VWF (perhaps via decreased thrombotic risk) is one possibility. However, the responsible protein could also be any of the large number of other endothelial protein products (in addition to VWF) that are likely to be altered by <italic>Mvwf1.</italic> It is also possible that loss of GI epithelial <italic>B4galnt2</italic> expression, rather than gain of endothelial expression, confers a fitness advantage in wild mouse populations. If the underlying explanation is indeed reduced plasma VWF, then similar positive selective pressures may have contributed to the high prevalence of von Willebrand disease in multiple mammalian species, including humans.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><supplementary-material id="N0x1a530c0N0x2fa0660" content-type="local-data"><media xlink:href="335_2007_9079_MOESM1_ESM.pdf" id="MOESM1" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"><caption><p>147 KB (doc)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors acknowledge Dr. Wanda Filipiak, Galina Gavrilina, Dr. Thom Saunders, and Dr. Maggie Van Keuren for preparation of transgenic mice at the Transgenic Animal Model Core of the University of Michigan&#x02019;s Biomedical Research Core Facilities.
