The mammalian MAPK superfamily encompasses the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1 and ERK2), the p38 MAP kinases (p38&#x003b1;, &#x003b2;, &#x003b3;, and &#x003b4;), the big MAP kinase (BMK1/ERK5), and the c-Jun NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal kinases (JNK1, JNK2, and JNK3) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The JNK family of kinases is of particular importance for cellular responses to stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Most somatic cells express JNK1 and JNK2, the expression of JNK3 being restricted predominantly to the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. While the single homozygous deletions of either <italic>jnk1 </italic>or <italic>jnk2 </italic>in the mouse revealed a significant functional redundancy between JNK1 and JNK2, the compound <italic>jnk1</italic><sup>-/-</sup>/<italic>jnk2</italic><sup>-/- </sup>mutant mice die before birth, thus revealing the non-redundant role of the JNK family as a whole in development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In addition to development, JNKs play important roles in mediating cellular responses to oxidative, genotoxic, ribotoxic, and hyperosmotic stresses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. JNKs are activated via phosphorylation by two upstream JNK kinases (JNKK), MKK4 and MKK7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. In turn, JNKK are activated via phosphorylation by JNK kinase kinases (JNKKK). To date, at least 13 mammalian JNKKK have been identified, namely: (<italic>i</italic>) the MEK kinase (MEKK) family, containing 4 members, MEKK1, 2, 3, and 4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], (<italic>ii</italic>) the apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], (<italic>iii</italic>) the transforming growth factor &#x003b2;-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], and (<italic>iv</italic>) the family of mixed lineage kinases (MLK), containing three subfamilies, namely the MLK subfamily (MLK 1, 2, 3, and 4), the dual-leucine-zipper-bearing kinase subfamily (DLK and LZK), and the zipper sterile-&#x003b1;-motif kinase (ZAK) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Clearly, the complexity and specificity of JNK activation is executed mainly at the level of JNKKK, as the number of different JNKKK exceeds by far the number of JNKK. Upstream of JNKKK, the regulation of the JNK pathways is thought to be dependent on the activity of various small GTP-binding proteins (such as Rho, Rac, cdc42, Ras, and Ral) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Thus, elucidation of the mechanisms of activation of JNK by a stressor of interest necessarily involves the identification of GTPase(s) and JNKKK relaying a stress-generated signal to JNKK and JNK.</p><p>Toxic metals and their compounds (e.g. cadmium and arsenite) are among the most potent activators of JNK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Antioxidants prevent or reduce the activation of JNK by both cadmium and arsenite, suggesting that toxicant-induced oxidative stress is operative in the activation of JNK by these agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. However, the identification of specific mammalian JNKKK-JNKK modules involved in the activation of JNK by cadmium and arsenite has been difficult due to the complexity and potential redundancy of mammalian JNKKK.</p><p>The genome of the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster </italic>possesses all JNKKK, JNKK, and JNK families present in the mammalian genome, but represented, typically, by fewer genes. For instance, the mammalian MEKK family is represented in <italic>Drosophila </italic>by a single member, <italic>mekk1</italic>/D-MEKK1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The mammalian MLK family is represented in <italic>Drosophila </italic>by 2 members, <italic>slpr</italic>/D-MLK and <italic>CG8789</italic>/D-DLK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The fruit fly orthologues of mammalian ASK1 and TAK1 are <italic>pk92B</italic>/D-ASK and <italic>tak1</italic>/D-TAK1, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The fruit fly orthologues of MKK4 and MKK7 are <italic>mkk4</italic>/D-MKK4 and <italic>hep</italic>/D-MKK7, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Finally, Drosophila contains only one JNK gene, <italic>bsk</italic>/D-JNK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. This evolutionary conservation of JNK signal transduction pathways among metazoans underscores the fundamental importance of JNK in mediating inducible stress responses.</p><p>With the above rationale in mind, we employed <italic>Drosophila </italic>S2 cells and the RNA interference (RNAi) technique (also known as "knock down" technique) for gene silencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] to investigate the signal transduction pathways mediating the activation of D-JNK by cadmium and arsenite. We knocked down 13 upstream regulators of D-JNK, either singly or in combinations of up to 7 at a time. As a result of this approach, we demonstrate the involvement of D-MEKK1 and D-MKK7 in the activation of D-JNK by cadmium and arsenite.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Cadmium and arsenite activate D-JNK, D-p38 MAPK, and D-ERK in Drosophila S2 cells</title><p>To elucidate the responses of <italic>Drosophila </italic>MAP kinases to toxic metals, we employed S2 cells, an immortalized cell line of larval hemolymph origin. Activation of MAP kinases was assessed in immunoblot assays using antibodies specific for the phosphorylated forms of D-JNK, D-p38 MAPK, and D-ERK. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, both cadmium and arsenite triggered the phosphorylation of D-JNK, D-p38 MAPK, and D-ERK in a dose- and time-dependent manner. As significant activation of the three MAP kinases by either agent was achieved at relatively high doses (100 &#x003bc;M for cadmium and 200 &#x003bc;M for arsenite), we measured the overall toxicity to S2 cells of these doses of cadmium and arsenite. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> shows that 100 &#x003bc;M of cadmium triggered less than 40% cell death within 24 hours and that 200 &#x003bc;M of arsenite triggered ~50&#x02013;55% cell death within 24 hours. Further experiments (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) demonstrated that both cadmium and arsenite caused detectable phosphorylation of all three MAP kinases at doses as low as 50 &#x003bc;M. We concluded, therefore, that <italic>Drosophila </italic>MAP kinases respond to concentrations of cadmium and arsenite within and below the LD<sub>50 </sub>range of these agents.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Cadmium and arsenite activate JNK, p38 MAPK, and ERK in S2 cells.

At physiological pH, NAC abolished the ability of both cadmium and arsenite to trigger the phoshorylation of D-JNK, D-p38 MAPK, and D-ERK (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, compare lanes 2&#x02013;7 to lanes 11&#x02013;16), but had no effect on the activation of D-JNK by sorbitol, an hyperosmotic stressor (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, compare lanes 8 and 9 to lanes 17 and 18). Similar results were obtained using 6-Hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchroman-2-carboxylic acid (Trolox<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>), a water-soluble derivative of vitamin E with antioxidant properties (not shown). We concluded, therefore, that as in mammalian cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], cadmium and arsenite activate <italic>Drosophila </italic>MAP kinases via ROS-dependent oxidative stress. These findings underscore the usefulness of the fly model to investigate cellular responses to environmental pollutants of relevance to human cells.</p></sec><sec><title>D-MKK7 mediates the activation of D-JNK by cadmium and arsenite</title><p>To elucidate the respective contributions of D-MKK4 and D-MKK7 in the activation of D-JNK by cadmium and arsenite, we employed the method of RNA interference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] to "knock down" the levels of D-MKK4 and D-MKK7 mRNAs either singly or in combination. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref> demonstrates that dsRNA directed against D-MKK4 and D-MKK7 mRNAs (but not "control" dsRNA directed against a neomycin-resistance gene not present in S2 cells) reduced the levels of D-MKK4 and D-MKK7 mRNAs below detection by RT-PCR. Under these conditions, the D-MKK7 dsRNA, but not the D-MKK4 dsRNA, significantly reduced the respective abilities of cadmium and arsenite to activate D-JNK (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>, compare lanes 2, 5, 8, 11, and 14 for cadmium and lanes 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 for arsenite; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref> shows a quantification of the phosphorylation of D-JNK normalized for the levels in each lane of D-actin). Knocking down both D-MKK4 and D-MKK7 mRNAs in combination did not result in further inhibition of the activation of D-JNK by cadmium and arsenite (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>, lanes 10&#x02013;15). We concluded, therefore, that MKK7 is a major mediator of the activation of D-JNK by cadmium and arsenite.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><italic>Hep</italic>/D-MKK7 mediates the activation of JNK by cadmium and arsenite.

D-DLK was not included in the this analysis, as S2 cells have been found to be deficient in D-DLK expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Using appropriate stimuli, we were able to demonstrate efficient desired interference with the function of each of the chosen JNKKK. Specifically, (<italic>i</italic>) D-TAK dsRNA blocked the activation of D-JNK by LPS (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, lane 5), a result consistent with the findings of Chen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]; (<italic>ii</italic>) D-MLK dsRNA blocked the activation of D-JNK by resveratrol and ethanol (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, lane 3 for resveratrol and not shown for ethanol, <italic>manuscript in preparation</italic>); (<italic>iii</italic>) D-ASK dsRNA blocked the activation of D-p38 MAP kinase by resveratrol (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, lane 8). Importantly, D-MEKK1 dsRNA reduced dramatically the activation of D-JNK by both cadmium and arsenite, while not affecting the activation of D-JNK by either resveratrol or LPS (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, lane 4). (Although the experiment presented in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> appears to demonstrate a role for D-TAK in the activation of D-JNK by cadmium, this result was not consistently reproducible.) Knocking down all four JNKKK together reduced the activation of D-JNK by cadmium and arsenite more efficiently than did knocking down of D-MEKK1 alone (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, compare lanes 4 and 6), suggesting that JNKKK other than D-MEKK1 may contribute in a minor fashion to the full activation of D-JNK by toxic metals. Knocking down all four JNKKK proteins appeared to reduce the activation of D-p38 MAPK by cadmium significantly better than knocking down any single JNKKK (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, lanes 7&#x02013;12). Interestingly, knocking down all four JNKKK proteins did not reduce substantially the ability of arsenite to activate D-p38 MAPK (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, lanes 7&#x02013;12). Furthermore, knocking down JNKKK either singly or together did not affect the ability of cadmium or arsenite to activate D-ERK (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, lanes 13&#x02013;18).</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>D-MEKK1 mediates the activation of JNK by cadmium and arsenite.

Expression of Rho1, RhoL, RalA, Rac1, Rac2, cdc42, and Ras mRNAs was detected by RT-PCR using specific primers as indicated (A).

Our analysis identified human MEKK4/MTK1 and mouse MEKK4 to be the closest homologues/orthologues of D-MEKK1, while the respective human and mouse MEKK2 and MEKK3 appeared to be the furthest in divergence (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>). In addition to the high amino acid identity within the kinase domains of D-MEKK1 and MEKK4/MTK1 (53% identity, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>), the sequence analysis revealed a substantial degree of conservation within the N-terminal regulatory domains of D-MEKK1 and MEKK4/MTK1 (20% identity, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>). On the other hand, MEKK2 and MEKK3 appear to be furthest in divergence from D-MEKK1. It is also interesting to note that the MEKKs display distinct rates of divergence and selective conservation between their N-terminal regulatory domains. For instance, the N-terminal domain of D-MEKK1 displays two identifiable protein motifs that are present only in MEKK4/MTK1 and MEKK1: the proline-rich motif and the pleckstrin homology domain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]). The small GTPase-binding motifs of mammalian MEKK1 and MEKK4/MTK1 (a Ras-binding domain in MEKK1 and a cdc42/Rac-interactive binding motif in MEKK4/MTK1), however, are not present in D-MEKK1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]). This suggests that small GTPase binding may not have been a requirement for regulation of the ancestral MEKK by oxidative stressors such as toxic metals and their compounds. Such a hypothesis is in agreement with the apparent lack of involvement of D-Rho1, D-RhoL, D-RalA, D-Rac1, D-Rac2, D-cdc42, and D-Ras in the activation of D-JNK by cadmium and arsenite in S2 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Future mutational studies on D-MEKK1 combined with analysis of selective conservation within the N- and C-terminal domains in its mammalian homologues would contribute to the better understanding of the evolution of the JNK pathway signaling.</p><fig position="float" id="F7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p>Comparison of the MEKK family: phylogenetic history and conserved domains.

Establishment of simpler model systems (e.g. using organisms of lower complexity) has proven useful in studying signaling pathways as long as these pathways are evolutionary conserved. Toxic metals and their compounds (such as cadmium and arsenite) are among the most ancient xenobiotic stressors affecting all forms of life. Therefore, it is highly probable that the cellular systems that identify and respond to toxic metals are fairly conserved within Metazoa. The fruit fly offers three major advantages as a model system to study cellular stress. First, <italic>Drosophila </italic>possesses many of the stress-induced signal transduction pathways relevant to man [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], the JNK pathway being one obvious example. Second, <italic>Drosophila </italic>displays, as a rule, lesser genetic complexity and redundancy of the same signaling pathways. For instance, the mammalian JNK family (JNK1, 2, and 3) is represented in the fly by a single member, D-JNK. Third, transient gene silencing by RNA interference (RNAi) is technically simpler, more efficient, and more affordable in <italic>Drosophila </italic>cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].</p><p>With the above rationales in mind, we undertook to identify upstream regulators of JNK that mediate the activation of the kinase by cadmium and arsenite. The principal novel findings we report here are that: (<italic>i</italic>) cadmium and arsenite activate D-JNK by means of oxidative stress similar to their action in mammalian cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]; (ii) the action of both cadmium and arsenite on JNK requires the engagement of upstream kinases at the level of JNKK and JNKKK; and (iii) D-MEKK1 is the predominant JNKKK that appears to mediate D-JNK activation in response to both cadmium and arsenite. We will discuss below the possible implications of these findings to the mammalian responses to toxic metals.</p><sec><title>Evolutionary conservation of metal toxicity through oxidative stress</title><p>We have reported previously that pretreatment of Rat-1 fibroblasts with NAC completely abolished the activation of JNK by both cadmium and arsenite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], suggesting that oxidative stress through depletion of cellular glutathione is the <italic>modus operandi </italic>for JNK activation by these agents in mammalian cells. The ability of NAC (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) and other antioxidants (such as lipoic acid and Trolox<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, not shown) to inhibit JNK activation in <italic>Drosophila </italic>S2 cells underscores the suitability of the <italic>Drosophila </italic>model system for heavy metal-related toxicological studies, especially in terms of signal transduction pathways regulated by metal toxicants.</p></sec><sec><title>Requirement for upstream kinases (JNKK and JNKKK) for the activation of D-JNK by toxic metals</title><p>Over the last decade, two mechanisms have been postulated for the activation of JNK by arsenite. One mechanism suggests that active engagement, by arsenite, of upstream kinases such as the JNKK MKK4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] and members of the MEKK family of JNKKK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] is a prerequisite for the activation of JNK by this agent. Yet Cavigelli <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] have found evidence that kinases upstream of JNK are not activated by arsenite. The experimental data suggested rather that arsenite activated JNK by means of inactivating a JNK phosphatase, thus increasing the steady-state levels of phosphorylated JNK in arsenite-treated cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. The findings we report here lend support to the former mechanism.</p><p>In studying the regulation of JNK by cadmium, Matsuoka <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] used mouse embryonic stem cells deficient in either MKK4 or MKK7 and concluded that both JNKKs are required for the full activation of JNK by cadmium. However, Ding and Templeton [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>] used overexpression of dominant negative alleles of either MKK4 or MKK7 in mesangial cells to conclude that MKK7, but not MKK4, was responsible for the JNK activation by cadmium in these cells. Our results clearly identify a role for <italic>hep</italic>/D-MKK7 in the activation of D-JNK by cadmium (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). The results from the use of RNAi to knock down the mRNA for D-MKK4 are subject, however, to more than a single interpretation. On one hand, the results tend to indicate the lack of apparent involvement of D-MKK4 in the activation of D- JNK by cadmium and arsenite (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). However, although the levels of D-MKK4 mRNA were brought down to levels undetectable by 30 cycles of PCR (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>), the unavailability of suitable antibodies for detection of D-MKK4 precluded us from accessing the efficiency of the RNAi at the level of D-MKK4 protein. Thus, if D-MKK4 protein has a long half-life, the remaining amounts of D-MKK4 protein (even in the absence of available D-MKK4 mRNA) may have been sufficient to trigger JNK activation in cadmium- or arsenite-treated S2 cells. Further experiments are needed to clarify this point.</p><p>The need to identify the JNKKK(s) mediating the activation of JNK by cadmium and arsenite (and other oxidative stressors in general) in the genetically-simpler <italic>Drosophila </italic>system arises from the abundance of contradictory reports in the literature on the regulation of mammalian JNKKK by oxidative stress. Members of the mammalian MEKK family have been implicated by various research groups to mediate the activation of JNK by one or another oxidative stressor. Using dominant-negative alleles of MEKKs, Porter et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] concluded that MEKK2, 3, and 4 (but not MEKK1) mediate the activation of JNK by arsenite. In contrast, mouse embryonic stem cell-derived from cardiac myocytes deficient in MEKK1 displayed attenuated activation of JNK in response to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, a <italic>bona fide </italic>oxidative stressor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. However, in a recent report Cross &#x00026; Templeton [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>] described that mammalian MEKK1 is subject to <italic>inactivation </italic>rather than activation by oxidative stressors such as H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, menadione, and N-ethylmaleimide. These researchers identified the mechanism of this inactivation, namely the reversible glutathionylation of Cys<sup>1238 </sup>of MEKK1 in response to oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Yet other researchers reported that ASK1 is a mammalian JNKKK responsive to oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. In this case, the oxidation-dependent dissociation of an inhibitor of ASK1 (thioredoxin) was found to lead to the activation of ASK1, and subsequently, of JNK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. In summary, it appears that the mammalian response to oxidative stress may involve two different mechanisms of JNK activation, one mediated by MEKK-family member(s), and another by ASK1. One drawback of the published reports is that a systematic parallel investigation of the roles of MEKKs and ASK1 in the same cell type and using the same agents as oxidative stressors has not been done. Our results identified D-MEKK1 as a major JNKKK mediating the activation of D-JNK by cadmium and arsenite (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). Furthermore, we did not find evidence for an involvement of D-ASK in mediating the activation of D-JNK by cadmium and arsenite (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). One possible implication of these results is that the MEKK-dependent regulation of JNK by oxidative stressors is evolutionarily more ancient, whereas the ASK-dependent regulation of JNK by oxidative stressors has emerged more recently in evolutionary history.</p><p>Based on our findings and on the available published literature, we would like to propose that the ancestral pathway of regulation of JNK by cadmium and arsenite was dependent on the regulation of a MEKK type of JNKKK (represented by D-MEKK1 in the fly and by the MEKK family of kinases in mammals). In higher organisms the regulation of JNK appears to require a more complex modulation. This increased complexity is manifested by the expansion of the ancestral MEKK gene into a family of four MEKKs in mammals. Mammalian MEKK1 appears to have also acquired a regulatory Cys<sup>1238 </sup>residue that allows for the oxidation-triggered inactivation of this kinase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Our sequence analysis of MEKKs revealed that this cysteine residue is not present in D-MEKK1 or MEKK2, 3, and 4 (not shown). The need for more complex regulation of the JNK activity by oxidative stress in mammals has resulted also in the recruitment of ASK1 as another JNKKK. The interplay of MEKK(s) and ASK1 in mammalian cells is likely to determine the physiological outcomes (i.e. apoptosis <italic>vs</italic>. survival) of the cellular response to oxidative stress (see also refs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>] and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>] for discussion on the topic).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Experimental procedures</title><sec><title>Cell Culture</title><p><italic>Drosophila </italic>Schneider (S2) cells (Invitrogen) were cultured at room temperature in <italic>Drosophila </italic>serum-free medium (DSFM, Invitrogen) supplemented with 20 mM L-glutamine (Invitrogen) and antibiotic-antimycotic reagent (Invitrogen).</p></sec><sec><title>Chemicals</title><p>Cadmium chloride, sodium-m-arsenite, resveratrol, sorbitol, <italic>N</italic>-acetyl cysteine, and lipopolysacharide (LPS; derived from <italic>E. coli </italic>0111:B4) were from Sigma-Aldrich.</p></sec><sec><title>Antibodies</title><p>Phosphoepitope-specific antibodies against JNK, p38, and ERK were from Cell Signaling Technology.
