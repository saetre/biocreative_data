To achieve recruitment of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> RNA polymerase III, TBP is associated with two additional factors, Brf1 and Bdp1, to form the initiation factor TFIIIB. Previous data have suggested that the structure or dynamics of the TBP&#x02013;DNA complex may be altered upon entry of Brf1 and Bdp1 into the complex. We show here, using the altered specificity TBP mutant TBPm3 and an iterative <italic>in vitro</italic> selection assay, that entry of Brf1 and Bdp1 into the complex imposes a strict sequence preference for the downstream half of the TATA box. Notably, the selected sequence (TGTAAATA) is a perfect match to the TATA box of the RNA polymerase III-transcribed U6 small nuclear RNA (<italic>SNR6</italic>) gene. We suggest that the selected T&#x02022;A base pair step at the downstream end of the 8 bp TBP site may provide a DNA flexure that promotes TFIIIB-DNA complex formation.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The TATA-binding protein (TBP) plays an integral role in transcription by all three nuclear RNA polymerases, including transcription from promoters without a TATA box (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>). In the <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> RNA polymerase (pol) III apparatus, TBP is found in the recruitment factor TFIIIB, along with the TFIIB-related factor, Brf1 and the pol III-specific Bdp1. <italic>In vivo</italic>, TFIIIB is assembled onto the DNA via TFIIIC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>), but this requirement can be bypassed <italic>in vitro</italic> if a TATA box is present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>), allowing TBP to bind the DNA and nucleate a stepwise TFIIIB assembly requiring Brf1 to bind the TBP&#x02013;DNA complex before Bdp1 can associate. These TFIIIB complexes are indistinguishable <italic>in vitro</italic> from those assembled by TFIIIC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>). Even when TFIIIB is assembled by TFIIIC, direct interaction of TBP with its cognate site contributes to accurate transcriptional initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>).</p><p>TBP binds DNA in the minor groove and induces a bend of the order of &#x0223c;80&#x000b0; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). TBP binds an 8 bp site with the consensus sequence TATAa/tAa/tN, where N is any base (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>), and an iterative <italic>in vitro</italic> selection performed using <italic>Acanthamoeba</italic> TBP on 84 bp DNA containing 40 randomized positions yielded only four classes of TATA box and a preference for TATATAAG [35 of 54 clones; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>)]. Complex stability measurements using DNase I footprinting and the frequency of a sequence appearing in the clones indicate that TBP is able to differentiate between A:T and T:A base pairs, and that the frequency with which a sequence is selected correlates with complex stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>).</p><p>While an A&#x02192;G substitution at the second base pair of the TATA box abolishes specific DNA binding by wild-type TBP, a mutant TBP known as TBPm3 was previously isolated from yeast and found to bind to the sequence TGTA as well as to the wild-type TATA box (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>). The three mutations (I194F, L205V, and V203T) that confer this altered specificity, are in close proximity in the folded protein and are in a position to interact with the second base pair of the TATA box (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>). TBPm3 assembles a stable TFIIIB-DNA complex that is functional for pol III transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>).</p><p>We are exploiting the specificity of binding of TBPm3 to orient the protein unidirectionally on the DNA and investigate TBP&#x02013;DNA contacts within the downstream half of the TATA box as a function of Brf1 and Bdp1 association. It has been previously suggested that addition of Brf1 and Bdp1 to the TBP&#x02013;DNA complex alter its conformation or dynamics: (i) While a missing nucleoside at the downstream end of the TATA box, coinciding with the site of TBP-mediated DNA kinking (base pair &#x02212;23), significantly enhances complex formation, the TFIIIB complex abrogates this preference, instead preferring missing nucleosides within an extended region downstream of the TATA box (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>), (ii) examination of TFIIIB interacting with a region upstream of the <italic>SUP4</italic> tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup> gene by photochemical crosslinking showed TBP in proximity to the DNA minor groove, except for contacts to the DNA major groove at base pair &#x02212;23 of the transcribed strand which were enhanced upon TFIIIB-DNA complex formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>) and (iii) the structure of a ternary complex composed of TBP, DNA and the primary TBP-binding domain of Brf1 revealed an exceptionally large number of interactions that bury 3230 &#x0212b;<sup>2</sup> of TBP surface area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>).</p><p>Here, we use an iterative <italic>in vitro</italic> selection to compare the sequence preference exhibited by TBPm3 and TFIIIB assembled with TBPm3. We show that the sequence preference of TBPm3 is less stringent than that reported for wild-type TBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). Notably, entry of Brf1 and Bdp1 into the complex imposes a strict sequence preference for the downstream half of the TATA box that matches the TATA box of the pol III-transcribed U6 small nuclear RNA (<italic>SNR6</italic>) gene.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Protein purification</title><p>Plasmids expressing TBPm3, Brf1 and Bdp1 were generous gifts from E.

The observed rate of dissociation is comparable with that observed for wild-type TBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>). Association of TBPm3 with DNA is detectable after 10 s, and a gradual increase in complex formation is observed after longer incubation times. The second-order rate constants for association of TBPm3 with DNA containing either the TATA or TGTA box are comparable (5.3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> and 3.1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> M<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, respectively, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and well within the range of values reported for association of wild-type TBP with various DNA substrates, using a variety of techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>). The calculated equilibrium dissociation constant for TBPm3 binding to the TATA or TGTA probe is 0.3 and 0.6 nM, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Determination of TBPm3 sequence preference for the downstream half of the TGTA box</title><p>The ability of TBPm3 to bind the TGTA box unidirectionally was exploited to perform an iterative <italic>in vitro</italic> selection on a 76 bp DNA construct in which four bases at the downstream end of the TGTA box were randomized; this DNA construct derives from a modified tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup> gene in which a 6 bp TATA box was embedded in a G+C-rich surrounding sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>). The randomized region was selected to coincide with sites at which modulation by Brf1 and Bdp1 may be expected and includes positions 6, 7 and 8 of the TBP site and one base pair downstream (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>). Positions 1&#x02013;5 of the TBP site were retained to ensure unidirectional binding, and inclusion of 1 bp downstream of the 8 bp TBP site in the randomized segment was chosen as TBP has been seen also to exhibit a sequence preference at this position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). For stringency of selection, the concentration of NaCl was raised to 150 mM during incubation of TBPm3 with DNA. With only 256 possible sequences, a consensus should be reached within 4&#x02013;5 rounds of selection. However, the sequence preference exhibited by TBPm3 was only modest after five rounds of selection (data not shown), so we elected to continue the selection for another five rounds. After 10 rounds of selection, the selected pool of DNA was again sequenced and a favored sequence determined for the four randomized bases (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). Of the sequenced clones, 66 contained the original TGTAA sequence and were used to determine the consensus for this selection. A total of 29 clones contained a TATAA box, suggesting its generation as a result of errors introduced during PCR; these sequences were not included in the alignment to avoid potential introduction of sequences arising from TBPm3 binding in the reverse orientation. A total of 17 clones contained a sequence comprised of a series of GTG repeats, with only the regions complementary to the primer sequences constant. The remainder of the clones contained sequence with no match to either of the above categories, such as other alterations to original TGTAA sequence. Alignment of the 66 TGTAA-containing sequences still showed a surprisingly modest sequence preference for each of the randomized positions. Whereas a C is generally disfavored at every position, position N1, corresponding to the sixth base pair of the TBP site, shows essentially only selection against C. Positions 7 and 8 of the TBP site (N2 and N3) reveal a modest preference for T, while a G is preferred at position N4. This is in contrast to bases selected by wild-type TBP, for which a G at positions equivalent to N1 and N2 was not observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Apparently, TBPm3 exhibits a less stringent sequence preference compared with wild-type TBP.</p><p>The results of the TBPm3 selection were verified by EMSA and MPE-Fe(II) footprinting on a DNA probe representing the most frequently selected bases at each position, TGTAA<underline>ATTG</underline> (note that this sequence represents the most frequently occurring bases at each randomized position, but was not found among the selected clones). TBPm3 was seen to bind to 26 bp DNA containing this sequence, while disfavored sequences, containing for example a C in position N1 (TGTAA<underline>CTGG</underline>) yield barely detectable complex formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and data not shown). MPE-Fe(II) footprinting on the 76 bp DNA containing the favored sequence indicates that TBPm3 is binding at the TGTA box, despite the fact that this sequence was not found among the selected clones, as seen by the partial protection from cleavage at positions &#x02212;28 to &#x02212;23 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), where the first T of the TGTA box is designated &#x02212;30. Enhanced cleavage was observed at base pair &#x02212;19, &#x02212;18 and &#x02212;31 consistent with that observed for wild-type TBP at these positions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>).</p><p>When the selection was performed using TFIIIB assembled with TBPm3, a distinct sequence preference emerged. A total of 25 clones containing the TGTAA sequence were aligned to determine the consensus for this selection. As for the TBPm3 selection, clones containing the TATAA sequence (25 clones) were excluded from the alignment, as were 13 clones containing the series of GTG repeats. While the occurrence of the GTG-repeat sequences in both selections is curious, we did not pursue this observation further. The remainder of the clones contained sequence with no match to the above categories, including other alterations to the 5&#x02032; half of the TGTA box. Alignment of the 25 TGTAA-containing sequences (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>) showed a much stronger sequence preference compared with TBPm3 alone, despite reaction conditions that should have allowed less stringent binding (100 mM NaCl versus 150 mM for the TBPm3 selection; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Notably, the selected consensus sequence (TGTAA<underline>ATAG</underline>) is a perfect match to the 8 bp U6 TATA box (TATAAATA).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><sec><title>TBPm3&#x02013;DNA complex formation</title><p>TBPm3 dissociates from its DNA site with first-order kinetics and exhibits second-order kinetics of association, as reported for wild-type TBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>). As also seen for wild-type TBP under comparable experimental conditions, rate determinations do not indicate any contribution from a competing TBPm3 monomer&#x02013;dimer equilibrium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>). Rates of association with either DNA probe are within the range reported for wild-type TBP, while the rate of dissociation is slower (<italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> of 61 and 72 min) compared with &#x0223c;10 min for wild-type TBP using DNA containing the 8 bp U6 TATA box (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>). This difference may be owing to the lower [NaCl] used here, as shown by the enhanced rate of dissociation of wild-type TBP that accompanies an increase in [KCl] from 60 to 80 mM [<italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> 100 versus 65 min using the AdML promoter TATA sequence; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>)]. In addition, more stable complex formation may be the consequence of sequence flanking the 8 bp TATA box [the A immediately downstream of the U6 TATA box used in previous assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>) was replaced with a G in the constructs used here]; while TBPm3 dissociates from TATAAATA<underline>G</underline> with <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> = 72 min (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> for dissociation from TATAAATA<underline>A</underline> is 53 min (data not shown). Sequence flanking the TATA box has been previously shown to modulate kinetics of TBP dissociation, in particular for TBP sites characterized by alternating A-T base pairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>).</p><p>TBPm3 binds to the TGTA and TATA probes with comparable affinity, but we note that the modestly higher affinity for the TATA-containing DNA (<italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> = 0.3 nM versus 0.6 nM for TGTA-containing DNA) is consistent with the identification of numerous TATA-containing sequences in the <italic>in vitro</italic> selections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). The basis for this difference in affinity may be the increased flexibility of the T&#x02022;A step relative to the T&#x02022;G step (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>). As for wild-type TBP, the rate of association of TBPm3 with DNA is orders of magnitude slower than the diffusion limit; for wild-type TBP, the rate of association appears not to be affected by flexure at the sites of DNA kinking, whereas complex stability is (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>). Consistent with this observation, rates of association of TBPm3 with either TATA- or TGTA-containing DNA are equivalent.</p><sec><title>Sequence preference of TBPm3</title><p>The orientation of TBP on the TATA box is such that the C-proximal TBP domain interacts with the 5&#x02032; half of the TATA box, while the N-proximal domain contacts the less-conserved 3&#x02032; half-site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>). Sequence specificity at the upstream half of the TATA box has been suggested to be in part imposed by the presence of a proline (Pro191) that would disallow any base other than a T at the 5&#x02032; end of the TATA box owing to steric clashes with other bases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>). The equivalent residue in the N-proximal TBP repeat is alanine (Ala100) which imposes no such steric constraints. The modest orientational preference of TBP observed <italic>in vitro</italic> has been suggested to derive also from differential DNA flexure at the two sites of kinking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>). In the preinitiation complex (PIC), however, the orientation of TBP is largely determined by interaction with other transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>).</p><p>For TBPm3, three substitutions create a binding pocket that can accommodate G at position two of the TATA box. TBPm3 exhibits an only modest sequence preference for the last four bases of the TGTA box, with C generally disfavored at every position. While A&#x02192;T and T&#x02192;A transversions cause little change to the chemical environment of the DNA minor groove, the introduction of GC or CG base pairs results in the exocyclic amino group of G protruding into the minor groove. For wild-type TBP, cavities in the interface between TBP and the DNA minor groove can be seen to accommodate a G in positions 3 and 6 of the TATA box (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>). The frequent occurrence of a G at position N1 (position 6 of the TBP site) was somewhat unexpected, but this portion of the helix is flattened and unwound in the wild-type TBP&#x02013;DNA co-crystal structure, and there may likewise not be steric clashes between TBPm3 and the DNA. The widening of the minor groove that accompanies bending into the major groove is more difficult with GC base pairs, hence the more easily deformable TA sequence is preferred by wild-type TBP. Perhaps TBPm3 features additional contacts that may support bending of more rigid sequences.</p><p>We note also that the bases most frequently selected at each position do not occur together. In its association with DNA, TBP introduces a significant bend at both ends of the TATA box. The energetically most favorable bending of <italic>B</italic>-DNA occurs by compression of the major groove with concomitant opening of the opposing minor groove; consequently, TBP generally targets A+T-rich regions that feature a greater range of minor groove widths. An exception is poly(dA) runs that exhibit local structural rigidity, as seen by the interlocking of major groove methyl groups of consecutive thymines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>). In an A&#x02022;T base pair step, the stacking of the methyl group of thymine against the adjacent adenine is likewise extensive. Consequently, TBPm3 may select against the sequence TGTAA<underline>ATTG</underline> owing to its inherent stiffness, even though each base is the most frequently selected at its respective position.</p><p>The sequence most frequently selected by wild-type TBP, TATATAA is followed by a G to complete the 8 bp TBP site, with a G or C found at the position immediately downstream (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). This sequence is selected against in our assay as the first five bases of the TGTA box (TGTA<underline>A</underline>) were held constant, thus a T in position five of the TATA box could only have arisen as a result of errors during PCR. Notably, of all the selected sequences, only one featured the sequence TGTA<underline>T</underline>, suggesting that it is not favored by TBPm3 (unlike the sequence T<underline>A</underline>TAA, which occurred in 29 of the clones, despite position two of the TBP site also not corresponding to a randomized position). Selection by wild-type TBP for a sequence that includes an A at position five of the TATA box was followed by the sequence A-T-A, generating the U6 TATA box TATAA<underline>ATA</underline>, with a C preferred at the position immediately downstream of this 8 bp TBP site (4 of 54 clones; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>)). Eight base pair alternating TA sequences were generally followed by a G or C (12 of 54 clones). Accordingly, the presence of a G following the 8 bp TBP site preferred by TBPm3 is consistent with the preferred base following an 8 bp A+T-containing sequences selected by wild-type TBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>). Since sequence flanking the 8 bp TBP site affects complex stability but not the rate at which TBP associates with the TATA box, flanking the A+T-rich TBP site with G+C-rich sequence may create border effects that stabilize bound TBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Brf1 and Bdp1 impose a strict sequence preference for the downstream half of the TATA box</title><p>The sequence preference of TFIIIB assembled with TBPm3 for the downstream half of the TGTA box differs significantly from that exhibited by TBPm3 alone. While TBPm3 mainly discriminates against C in positions N1&#x02013;N3, entry of Brf1 and Bdp1 into the complex imposes a strict preference for the sequence A-T-A. In both selections, a G at position N4 is preferred, although only modestly so for TBPm3. Comparable with the TBPm3 selection, no sequences occur in the TFIIIB selection with the sequence TGTA<underline>T</underline>. We also discount the possibility that TFIIIB may reverse orientation, as a C is strongly disfavored at position N2. Accordingly, the sequence selected by TFIIIB matches that of the native U6 TATA box, except that a G immediately downstream of the 8 bp TATA box is seen in preference to the naturally occurring A.</p><p>It was previously shown that stability of TBP on a 6 bp TATA box, which is suboptimal for TFIIIB assembly, is comparable with that of an 8 bp TATA box, which efficiently supports assembly of TFIIIB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>). The significant difference between TATA box sequences must therefore be structural or dynamic adaptations to interaction with Brf1 and Bdp1. In general, the DNA bending that occurs upon association with TBP brings flanking DNA segments closer together to facilitate contacts with other transcription factors that make up the PIC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>), and sequences that promote a disposition of DNA flanking the TBP-mediated DNA bends in a direction consistent with association of Brf1 and Bdp1 may be preferred. Indeed, analysis of TBP in complex with several divergent TATA sequences reveals comparable structures, yet only some are permissible for PIC formation; base pair changes may well be tolerated in terms of binding to TBP, but may negatively affect recruitment of other transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>).</p><p>The efficiency with which the TBP&#x02013;TATA complex promotes transcriptional activity depends on the sequence of the TATA box, including A-T transversions that do not alter functional groups present in the DNA minor groove. Presumably, TBP depends significantly on recognition of inherent flexibility of the TATA box, and such differences may also affect PIC assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>). For example, molecular dynamics simulations of different TATA variants suggest that DNA flexibility is correlated with transcriptional activity by RNA pol II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>). Correlating molecular dynamics simulations of TBP&#x02013;TATA complexes involving different TATA sequences with reported transcriptional activity by pol II further suggests that optimal pol II activity occurs on DNA that allows the two domains of TBP to rotate relative to each other and that allows the H2 helix of TBP to assume an optimal disposition to interact with factors that bind both TBP domains (such as Brf1). In contrast, low activity DNA sequences appear to promote movement of the H1 helix of TBP and to involve conformational changes in the DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>).</p><p>TBP introduces roll deformations at either end of the TATA box (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>). The T&#x02022;A base pair step is easily deformable owing to its large range of allowable roll angles and is often found in DNA sequences requiring a sharp bend (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>). Indeed, roll deformations at the downstream kink of TATA DNA in complex with TBP vary from &#x0223c;30&#x000b0; for A&#x02022;G steps to &#x0003e;45&#x000b0; for T&#x02022;A steps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>). A unique feature of the U6 TATA box sequence identified in our selections with TFIIIB is the presence of a T&#x02022;A step at the downstream end of the 8 bp TBP site. While this sequence is not strongly favored by either wild-type TBP or TBPm3 alone, it clearly promotes formation of the TFIIIB-DNA complex. Consistent with this interpretation, <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription with <italic>Drosophila</italic> nuclear extract indicated that while pol II utilizes the TATA box TATAAAAA in the forward direction, pol III reverses orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>). We suggest that the unique feature of the selected sequence is a flexibility at the downstream end of the 8 bp TATA box that promotes Brf1 and Bdp1 binding and the associated DNA deformation downstream of the TATA box (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors are grateful to E.
