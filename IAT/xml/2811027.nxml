In contrast to other SCARNA genes, SCARNA2 appears to be independently transcribed. By transient expression of SCARNA2-reporter gene constructs, we have demonstrated that this gene is transcribed by RNA polymerase II and that the promoter elements responsible for its transcription are contained within a 161 bp region upstream of the transcription start site. In mammals, we have identified four cross species conserved promoter elements, a TATA motif, an hStaf/ZNF143 binding site and two novel elements that are required for full promoter activity. Binding of the human hStaf/ZNF143 transcription factor to its target sequence is required for promoter activity, suggesting that hStaf/ZNF143 is a fundamental regulator of the SCARNA2 gene. We also showed that RNA polymerase II continues transcription past the 3&#x02032;-end of the mature RNA, irrespective of the identity of the Pol II promoter. The 3&#x02032;-end processing and accumulation are governed by the sole information contained in the scaRNA2 encoding region, the maturation occurring via a particular pathway incompatible with that of mRNA or snRNA production.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Pseudouridines and 2&#x02032;-<italic>O</italic>-methylriboses are the most two common modifications in ribosomal and small nuclear RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). In rRNAs and U6 snRNA, they are performed in the nucleolus by small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein particles (snoRNPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Box C/D snoRNPs direct the 2&#x02032;-<italic>O</italic>-methylation of riboses, while H/ACA snoRNPs catalyze pseudouridylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5 B6 B7 B8">5&#x02013;8</xref>). Box C/D snoRNPs are composed of a sequence-specific guide RNA associated with a set of at least four proteins: fibrillarin, Nop56, Nop58 and 15.5 kDa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Each box C/D snoRNA contains the conserved C, C&#x02032;, D and D&#x02032; box motifs. Typically, box H/ACA snoRNAs exhibit a common hairpin&#x02013;hinge&#x02013;hairpin&#x02013;tail structure with the H motif ANANNA in the single-stranded hinge region, and the ACA triplet located three nucleotides upstream of the 3&#x02032;-termini (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). H/ACA snoRNAs associate with the four H/ACA snoRNP proteins, the pseudouridine synthase dyskerin/Cbf5, Gar1, Nhp2 and Nop10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>).</p><p>U6 snRNA is synthesized by RNA polymerase III (Pol III) and is modified and assembled with proteins in the nucleus. In contrast, U1, U2, U4 and U5 (and likely U11 and U12) snRNAs are synthesized by RNA polymerase II (Pol II) and possess a distinct maturation pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10 B11 B12">10&#x02013;12</xref>). In the nucleus, the Pol II-specific snRNAs acquire a monomethyl guanosine (7mG) cap structure and are extended for at least 250 nucleotides beyond the 3&#x02032;-end of the mature RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). Stable pre-snRNAs intermediate bearing a short 3&#x02032;-end extension are generated by a transcription-linked cleavage event that requires a <italic>cis</italic>-acting element called the 3&#x02032;-box (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14 B15 B16">14&#x02013;16</xref>). After export to the cytoplasm, the pre-snRNA is assembled with the Sm proteins to form a pre-snRNP. Binding of the Sm proteins is needed for dimethylation of 7mG to form the 2,2,7-trimethylguanosine cap structure and for removal of the 3&#x02032; trailer. Subsequently, snRNPs are imported to the nucleoplasm and transiently accumulate in Cajal bodies (CB) where the snRNAs undergo specific 2&#x02032;-<italic>O</italic>-methylation and pseudouridylation directed by scaRNAs which accumulate in CB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17 B18 B19">17&#x02013;19</xref>). Vertebrate guide scaRNAs contain either one single (C/D or H/ACA) or two snoRNA boxes. The composite structures H/ACA-H/ACA, C/D-H/ACA, C/D-C/D or (C/D-C/D like box) were observed in scaRNAs harboring two associated boxes. The scaRNAs are synthesized in the nucleoplasm and a common sequence motif specifically determines the CB localization of box H/ACA scaRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). Very recently, the human protein WDR79 was shown to be associated with scaRNAs containing one single or two snoRNA boxes, the WDR79 binding being required for CB localization of a scaRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). In vertebrates, sequences encoding sno- and scaRNAs are generally located in introns of host genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). These intronic sno/scaRNAs are processed from the spliced and debranched host introns. U3 and U8 and most likely U13 snoRNAs, however, are transcribed from independent units by RNA polymerase II. In vertebrates, the basal promoter of the U3 snoRNA genes include an essential promoter sequence element (PSE) also found in the basal promoter of snRNA genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). Associated to the basal promoter of snRNA and snoRNA genes, the distal sequence element (DSE) plays a major role in transcription efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). The DSE are essentially composed of two functional submotifs, the octamer and the Staf Binding Site (SBS), that can reside simultaneously or individually (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). The capped scaRNA2 (mgU2-25/61) and scaRNA17 (mgU12-22/U4-8) are apparently encoded in intergenic regions and the presence of conserved motifs in the upstream region of the genes suggest that scaRNA2 and scaRNA17 are synthesized from independent units. The capped scaRNA2 contains a C/D box associated to a C/D like box domain. It is predicted to guide the specific 2&#x02032;-<italic>O</italic>-methylation of the U2 snRNA G25 and C61 positions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). To understand how scaRNA2 synthesis is controlled, we have cloned the gene and its flanking regions and demonstrated that 161 bp of the 5&#x02032;-flanking region are sufficient for efficient promoter activity. In this region, we have mapped four essential promoter elements and identified hStaf/ZNF143 as a critical transactivator interacting with the cognate <italic>cis</italic>-element. Furthermore, we have shown that transcription of the SCARNA2 gene is governed by RNA polymerase II and continues beyond the region encoding the mature scaRNA2. The 3&#x02032;-end processing and accumulation of the scaRNA2 are directed only by sequences within the scaRNA2 encoding region, contrasting with the mRNA or snRNA production pathways.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Reporter constructs</title><p>The human SCARNA2 promoter fragment &#x02212;250/+532 was PCR amplified from genomic DNA and cloned clockwise into pGEMTeasy (Promega) to create SCARNA2 &#x02212;250/+532.

The PCR products were cloned 5&#x02032; to the luciferase reporter gene in the SacI/BamHI cut promoterless pFLASH1 vector (Synapsis) to generate SCARNA2 &#x02212;250/+145 Luc, SCARNA2 &#x02212;250/+8 Luc, SCARNA2 &#x02212;161/+145 Luc, SCARNA2 &#x02212;88/+145 Luc and SCARNA2 &#x02212;25/+145 Luc. The SCARNA2 &#x02212;250/+532 maxigene (maxiSCARNA2) was obtained by insertion of a BamH1 site at position +281 of SCARNA2 &#x02212;250/+532. Substitution mutants giving rise to constructs Xsub, Ysub, SBSsub and TATA sub are listed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B. Substitution and insertion mutants were generated with the QuickChange II XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). The SCARNA2 maxigene with a deletion or an inverted orientation of the +421 to +532 region (positions relative to the wt gene) were obtained as follows. A Pst1 site was introduced at position +421 in maxiSCARNA2 and the resulting mutant was digested with Pst1 (Pst1cut at +425 and in the polylinker). Self-ligation yielded the SCARNA2 &#x02212;250/+421 maxigene &#x00394;3&#x02032; (maxiSCARNA2&#x00394;3&#x02032;) and SCARNA2 &#x02212;250/+421 inverted 3&#x02032; (maxiSCARNA2-inverted 3&#x02032;). pCMV-maxiSCARNA2 and pU3-maxiSCARNA2 were generated as follows. A SacII site was introduced at position &#x02212;8 of the maxiSCARNA2 containing a Pst1 site at position +421 and the SCARNA2 promoter was swapped with the entire CMV immediate early promoter from pcDNA3.1(+) (positions +206 to +855, Invitrogen) or the &#x02212;324 to &#x02212;1 fragment of the U3 snoRNA promoter amplified from human cell genomic DNA, to yield pCMV-maxiSCARNA2 and pU3-maxiSCARNA2, respectively. Swapping of the SCARNA2 3&#x02032; flanking sequence in maxiSCARNA2, pCMV-maxiSCARNA2 and pU3-maxiSCARNA2 (containing a Pst1 at position +421) with the SV40 polyadenylation signal (pA), amplified by PCR as a Pst1 fragment from pcDNA3.1(+) (positions +2947 to +3192), yielded maxiSCARNA2-pA, pCMV-maxiSCARNA2-pA and pU3-maxiSCARNA2-pA, respectively. MaxiSCARNA2-3&#x02032;boxU1, pCMV-maxiSCARNA2-3&#x02032;boxU1 and pU3-maxiSCARNA2-3&#x02032;boxU1 were created by swapping the SCARNA2 3&#x02032; flanking sequence in maxiSCARNA2, pCMV-maxiSCARNA2 and pU3-maxiSCARNA2 (with a Pst1 at position +421) digested by Pst1 and Nde1 with the oligonucleotide ctgcagaGTTTCAAAAGTAGActgtacatatg containing the U1snRNA 3&#x02032; box (3&#x02032;-box in capitals). Maxi U6 was created by inserting the 16 bp GACCTCGAGGCGGTTC sequence at position 87 of the human U6.2 gene.

As the capped 5&#x02032;-end of the 420 nt long scaRNA2 was previously mapped by primer extension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>), various constructs containing sequences upstream and downstream of the +1 of the scaRNA2 were generated. Constructs containing progressive 5&#x02032; truncated portions of the &#x02212;250/+145 regions were transiently transfected into COS-7 cells. The luciferase activity of the resulting cell extracts was further measured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). Analysis of the firefly luciferase values, normalized to the activity of the renilla luciferase control, revealed that similar promoter activity was observed with fragments containing 161 bp or more upstream of the +1 (compare the luciferase activity of fragments &#x02212;250/+145 and &#x02212;161/+145 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A).

Construct &#x02212;25/+145, which contains only 25 bp of the SCARNA2 gene flanking sequence, led to abrogation of the luciferase activity, showing it is not sufficient on its own for promoter activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A). Finally, the luciferase activity of construct &#x02212;250/+8 containing only 8 nucleotides of the transcribed region was equivalent to that of construct &#x02212;250/+145 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A).

Furthermore, the 5&#x02032;-flanking region of the SCARNA2 gene contains no obvious initiator (Inr) or downstream promoter element (DPE) in the vicinity of the transcription start site (TSS). Collectively, this computational analysis revealed the presence of four conserved motifs in the basal promoter of the mammalian SCARNA2 gene, constituting putative elements regulating its expression. Multiple sequence alignments of the Fugu, Tetraodon, Stickleback, Medaka and <italic>Xenopus tropicalis</italic> SCARNA2 promoters (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp988/DC1">Supplementary Figure S1</ext-link>B) revealed conservation of only the SBS and TATA element identified in the mammalian promoters, suggesting their crucial role in SCARNA2 gene expression.</p><p>To evaluate the role of the phylogenetically conserved elements, we introduced individual mutations into the X, Y, SBS and TATA elements (Xsub, Ysub, SBSsub and TATAsub in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). Expression of the reporter gene directed by the mutated SCARNA2 promoters was monitored by the luciferase activity after transfection into COS-7 cells. Mutation of the SBS reduced the SCARNA2 promoter activity to about 30% of the wt level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C, compare wt and SBSsub). These results provide strong evidence for the presence of a biologically active SBS in the SCARNA2 promoter. The effect on transcription activity of substituting the Y element (Ysub, 73% of the wt level) is of the same order as that of the TATA element mutation (TATAsub, 79% of the wt level). In contrast, substitution of the X element reduced drastically expression from the promoter to 14% of the wt level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C, compare wt and Xsub). Finally, SBSsub was modified by sequentially introducing substitutions into the TATA, Y and X elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C, the simultaneous mutations of the SBS and TATA element reduced the luciferase activity to about 20% of the wt level (compare wt, SBSsub and SBSsub-TATAsub). The reporter activity of the triple mutant Ysub-SBSsub-TATAsub was of the same order as that of the double SBSsub-TATAsub mutant, indicating that the Y element is not essential for SCARNA2 gene expression. In contrast, introduction of a fourth mutation by substitution in the X element led to basal levels of luciferase activity (compare wt, Ysub-SBSsub-TATAsub and Xsub-Ysub-SBSsub-TATAsub in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C). Next, the RPA was used to evaluate the functionality of the identified four promoter elements in the context of the SCARNA2 gene and its 3&#x02032;-flanking regions. We made use of the SCARNA2 maxigene with a 6 bp insert in the central part of the gene. The 6 bp insert offers the possibility to discriminate the endogenous scaRNA2 from the product of the transfected gene. HeLa cells were transfected with the wt maxiSCARNA2, Xsub maxiSCARNA2, Ysub maxiSCARNA2, SBSsub maxiSCARNA2, TATAsub maxiSCARNA2 and Xsub-Ysub-SBSsub-TATAsub maxiSCARNA2 constructs together with plasmid p&#x003b1;1 as the internal transfection control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). RNAs were analyzed by RPA of an antisense RNA probe complementary to region +207/+299 of the nontranscribed strand maxigene and containing the 6 bp insert (probe 1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). Results were normalized to the expression of the &#x003b1;-globin mRNA included as an internal standard. Analysis of the mutation effects revealed an expression pattern of SCARNA2 that is globally similar to that observed with the SCARNA2 promoter mutants placed in front of a luciferase reporter gene. The predominant role of the X and SBS motifs is still observed, with Xsub and SBSsub expressed at 32% and 48% of the wt level, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B, compare lane 3 with lanes 4 and 6). Next, to investigate the possible alteration of the TSS by the different mutant promoters, we performed an RPA with probe 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A) that is complementary to a region of the nontranscribed strand containing the TSS of the SCARNA2 gene. The presence of three protected fragments when the wt maxiSCARNA2 gene was used (fragments b, c and d in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C, lane 1) suggests the existence of three different TSS. The other analyses revealed that transcription initiation occurred at exactly the same position when the Xsub, Ysub and SBSsub maxiSCARNA2 mutants were used (data not shown). Surprinsingly, with the TATAsub mutant the relative alteration in the yield of fragments b, c and d, plus the detection of a fourth product (product a in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C, lane 2) revealed an alteration of the TSS when the TATA element is mutated. <fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Transcription assays of wild-type and mutated human SCARNA2 gene promoters and polymerase transcribing status of the SCARNA2 gene.

To verify this hypothesis, we performed transcription assays with the wt maxiSCARNA2 gene in the presence of plasmid p&#x003b1;1 as the Pol II control under &#x003b1;-amanitin conditions inhibiting Pol II but not Pol III transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>D). The extracted RNAs were analyzed by RPA with probes 1 and anti p&#x003b1;1; the absence of protected RNA products in the presence of &#x003b1;-amanitin demonstrated that the SCARNA2 gene is transcribed by RNA polymerase II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>D, compare lanes 1, 2 and 3).

Lastly, the absence of transcriptional activity of the TATAsub mutant in the presence of &#x003b1;-amanitin under conditions inhibiting Pol II transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>D, lane 4) demonstrated that Pol II is responsible for the activity of the TATA sub template (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B, lane 7).</p><p>Taken together, these results indicate that Pol II is the polymerase acting on the SCARNA2 gene and that there are four positive regulatory elements in the human SCARNA2 promoter, the function of the X and SBS motifs being predominant for full promoter activity.

In contrast, we were unable to detect a retarded complex with the unprogrammed reticulocyte lysate (compare lane 1 with lanes 3 and 6 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A). The specificity of binding was confirmed by competition studies.

In contrast, an unrelated oligonucleotide was unable to compete (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A, lane 5). To demonstrate that the hStaf/ZNF143 binding pattern was strictly dependent on the SBS integrity, similar binding assays were carried out with hStaf/ZNF143 and a promoter mutant having the &#x02212;70 CTCCCA &#x02212;65 sequence in the SBS substituted by GATATC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>).

To confirm the specificity of binding, positive and negative controls were performed. PCR amplification of the tRNA<sup>Sec</sup> promoter, which binds hStaf/ZNF143 as well, was used as the positive control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). The negative control amplified a segment located several kilobasepairs upstream from the tRNA<sup>Sec</sup> transcribed region, which does not harbor any hStaf/ZNF143 binding site.

Transcription of the genes encoding these RNAs continues beyond the 3&#x02032;-box <italic>in vivo</italic> and produces a precursor form that is not abundant in a steady-state level. The 3&#x02032;-box is not an efficient transcription terminator but may rather act as a processing element functioning in the precursor RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Scrutiny of the sequence located at proximity of the 3&#x02032;-end of the mature scaRNA2 did not show any motif with sequence similarity to the 3&#x02032;-box of Pol II snRNA genes, reading typically GTTTN0-3AAARN2AGA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). The 3&#x02032;-end of the mature scaRNA2 was previously mapped to position +420 of wt scaRNA2 gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). Accumulation and processing of the expressed scaRNA2 were tested here by RPA using specific antisense probes 3 and 4 that map to the 3&#x02032;-end of the RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A). Each probe is complementary to the same 3&#x02032;-part of the mature scaRNA2 (positions +368/+420 of the wt gene) and to 21 and 111 nucleotides of downstream regions for probes 3 and 4, respectively. With both probes, protected fragments arising from the mature scaRNA2 could be detected with RNA extracted from untransfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B, lanes 1 and 2). With RNA isolated from maxiSCARNA2 gene transfected cells, probes 3 and 4 detected the mature scaRNA2 and longer products corresponding to scaRNA2 precursors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B, compare lanes 3 and 4). Due to the low concentration of the endogenous scaRNA2, the probes detected only the transfected overexpressed RNA precursors. As expected, the RNA precursor was undetected in an RPA performed with RNA isolated from cells transfected with maxiSCARNA2 gene bearing mutations in the four promoter elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B, lane 5). To investigate whether the 3&#x02032;-flanking region of the SCARNA2 contains elements that promote proper 3&#x02032;-end processing or accumulation, we deleted the genomic sequence downstream of the mature scaRNA2 3&#x02032;-end in the maxiSCARNA2 gene to create maxiSCARNA2&#x00394;3&#x02032; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A). We also generated construct maxiSCARNA2-inverted 3&#x02032; bearing the downstream region in an inverted orientation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A). After cell transfection, we examined the accumulation and the presence of an RNA precursor by RPA using RNA probes complementary to the 3&#x02032;-part of the mature scaRNA2 and downstream regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A, probes 5 for maxiSCARNA2&#x00394;3&#x02032; and 6 for maxiSCARNA2-inverted 3&#x02032;).

After 48 h, RNAs were extracted and analyzed by RPA with three different probes (probes 1, 3 and 4 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A). RPA with probe 1 complementary to the central part of the maxiscaRNA revealed that scaRNA2 is expressed more efficiently from pCMV-maxiSCARNA2 (3.5-fold) and pU3-maxiSCARNA2 (1.45-fold) than from the wt maxiSCARNA2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>E, compare lane 1 with lanes 2 and 3). RPA with probes 3 and 4 revealed that expression from the CMV or the U3 snRNA promoters resulted in the accumulation of scaRNA2 correctly processed at the 3&#x02032;-end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B, compare lanes 3, 4 with lanes 6, 7 and 8, 9). From these results, we conclude that scaRNA2 can be produced and properly 3&#x02032;-end processed from a variety of Pol II promoters.

These results confirm that the region downstream of the mature 3&#x02032;-end is inert in 3&#x02032;-end processing and that only signals in the mature scaRNA2 direct its processing and accumulation.</p><p>In a second step, we swapped the wild-type 3&#x02032;-flanking sequence in the SCARNA2maxigene with the mRNA polyadenylation signal (polyA) of the SV40 or the human U1 snRNA 3&#x02032;-box (3&#x02032;-boxU1) downstream element (contructs maxiSCARNA2-pA and maxiSCARNA2-3&#x02032;boxU1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A). Note that the poly A signal is essential for processing and stability of mRNAs, while this role in snRNAs is devoted to the 3&#x02032;-box. The polyA signal and U1 snRNA 3&#x02032;-box were also introduced into the constructs harboring the U3 snoRNA or CMV promoters in place of the wt SCARNA2 promoter (pU3-maxiSCARNA2-pA, pU3-maxiSCARNA2-3&#x02032;boxU1, pCMV-maxiSCARNA2-pA and pCMV-maxiSCARNA2-3&#x02032;boxU1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A).

First, RPA results with probe 1 and anti p&#x003b1;1 as the internal standard showed that addition of the 3&#x02032;-box U1 or polyA signal in the context of the wt SCARNA2 promoter reduced the accumulation of the RNA to 61% and 34% of the wt level, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B, compare lane 1 with lanes 2 and 3). Similarly, in the context of the U3 snoRNA promoter, the presence of the U1 snRNA 3&#x02032;-box reduced the accumulation of the RNA to 75% of the wt level, that obtained with the addition of the polyA signal being 66% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B, compare lane 4 with lanes 5 and 6). The yield of the transcribed RNA probed with internal probe 1 is only slightly affected by the presence of the 3&#x02032;-end processing elements in the context of the CMV promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B, compare lane 7 with lanes 8 and 9). Probes 7, 8 and 9 will be used to follow formation of the 3&#x02032;- end from constructs containing the polyA signal, the 3&#x02032;-box U1 or the wt sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A).

The correctly processed 3&#x02032;-end mature and precursor scaRNA2 are easily detectable using probe 9 with RNA isolated from cells transfected with pCMV-maxiSCARNA2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C, lane 4). In contrast, in the presence of the polyA signal or 3&#x02032;-box U1, the transcribed RNA was uncorrectly processed and we were unable to detect accumulation of similar amounts of mature scaRNA2 (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C, compare lanes 2 and 3 with lane 4). Similar results were obtained when the pA signal or the 3&#x02032;-box U1 were inserted in the context of the wt or U3snoRNA driven maxiSCARNA2. However, a lower yield of products was observed (data not shown). Although processing of the scaRNA2 was independent of the genomic sequence located 3&#x02032; to the mature RNA, addition of the poly A signal or snRNA 3&#x02032;-box reduced significantly the accumulation of scaRNA2 correctly processed at the 3&#x02032;-end. <fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>Introduction of 3&#x02032;-end processing elements inhibits production of mature scaRNA2.

In addition, scaRNA2 maturation occurs via a pathway incompatible with that of mRNAs or snRNAs.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In vertebrates, sequences encoding scaRNAs are generally located in the introns of their host genes. Intronic scaRNAs are produced after the splicing step by processing of the debranched intron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Here, we demonstrated that the 161 bp region located upstream of the mature scaRNA2 bears sufficient information for Pol II transcription of the SCARNA2 gene. This is consistent with the high-resolution map of the genome wide distribution of RNA polymerase II which localizes it to a region covering positions &#x02212;345 to +40 of the SCARNA2 gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). Furthermore, the present study established that transcription of the human SCARNA2 gene is governed by four <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements that are evolutionarily conserved, a TATA motif, a SBS and two novel, previously uncharacterized motifs that have been identified in this study. The position of the TATA element suggests that it represents a <italic>bona fide</italic> TATA binding protein (TBP) motif, a key basal cis regulatory element shared by Pol II promoters of protein coding genes and a few RNA polymerase III promoters. The CTTAAAAG sequence of the TATA element diverges in the 5&#x02032;-part from the TATAAAAG consensus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). However, structural studies of TBP&#x02013;DNA complexes concluded that such a nucleotide sequence variability does not impair TBP recognition, the protein being able to accommodate C at position 1 and T at position 2 of the TATA element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>). Indeed, we showed that nucleotide substitutions in the TATA element had only a minor impact on transcription efficiency of the SCARNA2 gene. Besides, substitution in the TATA sequence led to new TSS, as already observed for protein-coding genes lacking TATA elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>). It is therefore likely that the function of the TATA element is to ensure correct initiation of transcription as in other Pol II transcribed genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>). Motifs X and Y that we characterized in this study do not correspond to any <italic>cis</italic>-acting motif previously identified. They are only conserved in mammalian SCARNA2 promoters but are surprisingly absent in <italic>Xenopus</italic> and pufferfish SCARNA2 genes. This suggests that these two elements act in a species-specific manner. The third <italic>cis</italic>-acting motif that we identified is specifically recognized by hStaf/ZNF143 which was found associated to the SCARNA2 promoter <italic>in vivo</italic>. Although the <italic>Xenopus</italic> Staf was originally identified as the transcription activator of the tRNA<sup>Sec</sup> gene, it also controls expression of snRNA and snRNA-type genes transcribed by RNA polymerases II and III (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). Furthermore, hStaf/ZNF143 has been reported to regulate transcription of nine protein-coding gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). Lastly, a genome-wide analysis led us to identify 1175 Staf/ZNF143 binding sites distributed in 938 mammalian protein gene promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). This strongly suggests that hStaf/ZNF143 is involved in the transcriptional regulation of a very large number of protein coding genes. The present work extends the role of hStaf/ZNF143 to the transcription of the scaRNA2 gene which harbors a promoter organization different from that of snRNA and snRNA-type genes. Interestingly, the SCA2RNA promoter does not contain the PSE motif which is a key element in the transcription of snRNA genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Instead, the SCARNA2 gene carries promoter elements that look like those of protein-coding genes, as is the case for the telomerase RNA gene (TERC) and most likely SCARNA17. However, despite this resemblance, the organization of the elements is unique within the promoters of the SCARNA2 and TERC genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43 B44 B45">43&#x02013;45</xref>). The vast majority of snRNA genes are ubiquitously expressed while, in contrast, expression of most of the mRNA coding genes is temporally and spatially restricted. Thus, the presence of an mRNA-type promoter in the scaRNA2 gene can offer the possibility to also regulate its expression.</p><p>We have not detected elements in the context of the SCARNA2 gene that can influence the specificity of scaRNA2 synthesis. Furthermore, context elements known to promote accumulation of mRNA and snRNA inhibited rather than enhanced production of mature scaRNA2. Instead of a precursor context dependent pathway, processing of the scaRNA2 very likely relies on the integrity of the mature scaRNA2 and in particular on the C/D-C/D like boxes essential for scaRNP assembly. We propose, as described for the yeast snoRNP and human telomerase, that protein association with the scaRNA2 precursor to form scaRNP is a prerequesite to 3&#x02032;-end processing of the scaRNA2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>). This will be addressed in future investigations.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp988/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>Funding for open access charge: Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique.</p><p><italic>Conflict of interest statement</italic>.
