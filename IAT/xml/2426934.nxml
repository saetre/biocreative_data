Mps1 also recruits Mad1 and Mad2 to kinetochores. However, whether the enzymatic activity of Mps1 is required for these processes is unclear. To address this question, we established an RNA interference (RNAi) complementation assay. Repression of Mps1 triggers premature anaphase, often with unaligned or maloriented chromosomes. This phenotype is rescued by an RNAi-resistant wild-type Mps1 transgene but not by a catalytically inactive mutant. An analogue-sensitive allele, Mps1<sup>M602A</sup>, also rescues the RNAi-induced defect, but not when inhibited by the adenosine triphosphate analogue 1-NM-PP1. Thus, Mps1 activity does restrain anaphase during an unperturbed mitosis. Furthermore, although catalytically inactive Mps1 can restore kinetochore localization of Mad1, only the active kinase restores Mad2 localization. Thus, in human cells, Mps1 catalytic activity is required for spindle checkpoint function and recruitment of Mad2.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>O.

However, sister separation at anaphase is a global event, triggered shortly after the anaphase-promoting complex (APC/C) initiates proteolysis of securin and cyclin B1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Clute and Pines, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hagting et al., 2002</xref>). Consequently, maintaining accurate chromosome segregation requires that the APC/C is restrained until the last kinetochore stably attaches microtubules. This is achieved by an inhibitory network called the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Musacchio and Salmon, 2007</xref>).</p><p>The SAC consists of kinetochore-bound sensors, including Bub1, Mad1, and Mps1; a signal transducer known as the mitotic checkpoint complex, comprising BubR1, Bub3, Mad2, and Cdc20; and an effector, namely the APC/C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Musacchio and Salmon, 2007</xref>). Bub1, BubR1, and Mps1 are protein kinases, and, although phosphorylation appears to be integral to the SAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Nicklas et al., 1995</xref>), the specific roles of these kinases are far from clear. Indeed, kinase activity may not be required for checkpoint function itself; yeast strains harboring a Bub1 allele completely lacking the kinase domain are checkpoint proficient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Warren et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>Mps1, originally identified as a regulator of spindle pole body duplication in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Lauze et al., 1995</xref>), is also essential for SAC function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Weiss and Winey, 1996</xref>). Some studies have probed the requirement for Mps1 kinase activity in SAC signaling, but the emergent picture is complex. One study, which used kinase-dead and analogue-sensitive Mps1 alleles, showed that budding yeast Mps1 activity was required for SAC function when kinetochores fail to attach microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Jones et al., 2005</xref>). However, a second study using the small-molecule inhibitor cincreasin demonstrated that Mps1 activity was required for checkpoint activation when attached kinetochores fail to come under tension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Dorer et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>In vertebrates, the situation is equally complex. Consistent with a role in monitoring unattached kinetochores, reconstituting <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> egg extracts with a kinase-dead Mps1 failed to restore the checkpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abrieu et al., 2001</xref>). In this system, Mps1 is required for kinetochore recruitment of Bub1, Bub3, BubR1, Mad1, Mad2, and centromere protein E (Cenp-E), thus providing a possible mechanism for Mps1 function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abrieu et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wong and Fang, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Zhao and Chen, 2006</xref>). However, this is at odds with experiments in human tissue culture cells: although RNAi-mediated repression of Mps1 results in a failure to recruit Mad1 and Mad2, other checkpoint components such as Bub1, BubR1, and Cenp-E appeared unaffected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Liu et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>Another surprising observation from RNAi studies is that Mps1 only appears to be required for SAC function after spindle damage and not during an unperturbed mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Stucke et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Schmidt et al., 2005</xref>). Similarly, inhibition of Mps1 with the nonspecific JNK inhibitor, SP600125, results in SAC override, but only in the presence of spindle poisons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Schmidt et al., 2005</xref>). In contrast, other vertebrate SAC components restrain mitosis in the absence of spindle damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Musacchio and Salmon, 2007</xref>). Again, in contrast to the RNAi studies, SP600125 mislocalizes BubR1; its effect on Mad2 is unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Schmidt et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>These observations are also complicated by the fact that Mps1 plays multiple roles. In addition to spindle pole body duplication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fisk et al., 2004</xref>), Mps1 is required for kinetochore&#x02013;microtubule interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Dorer et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Jones et al., 2005</xref>), possibly via the phosphorylation of Dam1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Shimogawa et al., 2006</xref>). In yeast, Mps1 promotes kinetochore biorientation by eliminating malorientations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Maure et al., 2007</xref>). Human Mps1 may serve a similar function by regulating the aurora B kinase via phosphorylation of the chromosome passenger Borealin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Jelluma et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>In an attempt to reconcile these observations and dissect the role of Mps1 kinase activity in human cells, we established a complementation assay repressing endogenous Mps1 by RNAi followed by induction of RNAi-resistant Mps1 transgenes. Using time-lapse imaging of GFP-tagged chromosomes, we show that Mps1 kinase activity is required for SAC function during an unperturbed mitosis. Furthermore, we show that kinetochore localization of Mad2 but not Mad1 is acutely sensitive to the inhibition of Mps1 kinase activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><sec><title>shRNA-mediated repression of Mps1</title><p>To define the role of Mps1 kinase activity in SAC function, we set up a complementation assay repressing endogenous Mps1 by RNAi while simultaneously expressing RNAi-resistant transgenes. To do this, we generated an anti-Mps1 antibody to monitor RNAi efficiency. This antibody detects a single protein of &#x0223c;95 kD and decorates prometaphase kinetochores, which is consistent with Mps1's known properties (Fig. S1, A and B; available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200712028/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200712028/DC1</ext-link>). To inhibit Mps1, we screened a panel of short hairpin RNA (shRNA) vectors after transient transfection into HeLa cells. Immunoblotting and immunofluorescence identified one vector that efficiently repressed Mps1 (Fig. S1, C and D).</p><p>Quantitative immunoblotting indicated that Mps1 was repressed to &#x0003c;20% of its normal level (unpublished data). Because the transfections were typically &#x0223c;75% efficient, this residual protein is largely caused by the untransfected cells. Indeed, quantitation of pixel intensities in transfected cells reveals that kinetochore-bound Mps1 is reduced to &#x0003c;3% (Fig. S1 E). To determine whether this was sufficient to compromise Mps1 function, repressed HeLa cells were challenged with microtubule toxins for 18 h. While control cells arrested in mitosis, cells in the Mps1-RNAi population were in interphase, indicating SAC override (Fig. S1 F). Indeed, repression of Mps1 reduced the mitotic index twofold (Fig. S1 G), which is consistent with previous studies demonstrating that Mps1 is required for SAC function in response to spindle toxins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Stucke et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Liu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Schmidt et al., 2005</xref>). Time-lapse microscopy confirmed that Mps1-deficient cells failed to arrest when challenged with the Eg5 kinesin inhibitor monastrol (Fig. S1 H). Despite extensive repression, we did not observe centrosome defects, allowing us to focus on Mps1's checkpoint functions.</p></sec><sec><title>Mps1 restrains anaphase during an unperturbed mitosis</title><p>To study the role of Mps1 during an unperturbed mitosis, HeLa cells were cotransfected with shRNA vectors and a construct encoding GFP&#x02013;histone H2B. Transfected cells were analyzed by time-lapse microscopy to determine (1) the time from NEB to alignment of the last chromosome (i.e., NEB to metaphase), (2) the time from alignment of the last chromosome to sister separation (i.e., metaphase to anaphase), and (3) the quality of the segregation process (i.e., scoring for signs of an abnormal mitosis such as anaphase with unaligned chromosomes or anaphase bridges). In controls, metaphase chromosome alignment took &#x0223c;22 min, and, after a delay of &#x0223c;18 min, anaphase initiated (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, A and B</xref>). 92% of the controls completed mitosis normally, exhibiting a substantial delay (&#x0003e;10 min) after chromosome alignment (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>). In contrast, Mps1 repression affected both the timing and quality of chromosome segregation. Now, anaphase was initiated much quicker, occurring on average &#x0223c;9 min after metaphase (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, A and B</xref>). Indeed, &#x0223c;23% of Mps1-deficient cells entered anaphase within 10 min of metaphase, whereas only 5% of controls did so (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>). Furthermore, whereas not a single control cell entered anaphase with an unaligned chromosome, &#x0223c;15% of the Mps1-deficient cells entered anaphase with one or more unaligned chromosomes. In addition, &#x0223c;9% exhibited anaphase bridges and &#x0223c;8% exhibited other mitotic defects. Indeed, only &#x0223c;45% of cells completed mitosis normally (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>). Thus, repression of Mps1 accelerates the onset of anaphase, often before all the chromosomes align at metaphase, indicating that Mps1 is required for SAC function during an unperturbed mitosis. The overall effect of Mps1 RNAi on mitotic timing was modest, reducing the mean time from NEB to anaphase from &#x0223c;41 to &#x0223c;36 min. In contrast, inhibiting mitotic checkpoint complex components dramatically accelerates mitosis, with NEB-anaphase taking &#x0003c;15 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Meraldi et al., 2004</xref>). This suggests that Mps1 is not a component of the APC inhibitor but rather a kinetochore-based sensor responsible for generating the anaphase inhibitor.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Mps1 is required for spindle checkpoint function during an unperturbed mitosis.</bold> HeLa cells cotransfected with control or Mps1 shRNA plus a GFP&#x02013;histone H2B construct were analyzed by time-lapse microscopy.

In our hands, in cells with virtually undetectable levels of Mps1 at kinetochores, localization of aurora B, Bub1, BubR1, Cenp-E, and Cenp-F appeared largely unaffected (Fig. S2 A, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200712028/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200712028/DC1</ext-link>; and not depicted). In contrast, kinetochore-bound Mad1 was significantly reduced, and Mad2 was largely absent (Fig. S2 A). To quantitate these effects, pixel intensities were normalized to the anticentromere antibody (ACA) signal and plotted as a percentage of the value derived from unrepressed cells (Fig. S2 B). Consistent with our qualitative assessment, Mps1 RNAi had marginal effects on aurora B, Bub1, BubR1, Cenp-E, and Cenp-F (Fig. S2 B). In contrast, the amount of Mad1 and Mad2 at Mps1-deficient kinetochores was reduced by &#x0223c;74% and &#x0223c;95%, respectively (Fig. S2 B). Thus, our shRNA-based observations are entirely consistent with previous siRNA observations and together indicate that Mps1 targets Mad1 and Mad2 to kinetochores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Martin-Lluesma et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Liu et al., 2003</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Reconstitution of Mps1 function after shRNA-mediated repression</title><p>Next, we asked whether an RNAi-resistant Mps1 transgene could rescue the checkpoint defect observed after transfection of the shRNA vector. This would not only confirm that the SAC defect was caused by Mps1 repression, as opposed to an off-target effect, but it would also facilitate structure-function analyses. An Mps1 cDNA was rendered resistant to the shRNA sequence and cloned into an N-terminal GFP-tagged expression construct. Transfecting HeLa cells revealed GFP signal in the cytoplasm and at kinetochores (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>), which is consistent with Mps1's known localization. A stably transfected HeLa line was generated expressing the transgene under tetracycline control (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>). Transfection of the shRNA vector substantially reduced endogenous Mps1 levels, but the exogenous GFP-tagged protein was still abundant (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>). We then used time-lapse microscopy to determine the SAC status in Mps1-RNAi cells reconstituted with the wild-type transgene. As described above (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>), we scored as normal cells that delayed at metaphase for at least 10 min and then successfully completed chromosome segregation. Cells that initiated anaphase faster or with unaligned chromosomes, displayed lagging chromosomes in anaphase, or exhibited some other mitotic defect were considered abnormal. Although &#x0223c;90% of controls completed mitosis normally, only 37% of the Mps1-deficient cells did so (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>, left). Significantly, induction of the GFP-Mps1 transgene rescued the checkpoint defect, with 74% of the cells now completing a normal mitosis. Indeed, whereas 27% of the Mps1-deficient cells entered anaphase with one or more unaligned chromosomes (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C,</xref>red box), not one reconstituted cell entered anaphase with an unaligned chromosome. This demonstrates that the SAC defect is indeed caused by the repression of Mps1 as opposed to an off-target effect.</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Mps1 kinase activity is required for spindle checkpoint function.</bold> HeLa cells expressing tet-inducible RNAi-resistant GFP-tagged Mps1 fusions were transfected with shRNA vectors and analyzed by immunofluorescence microscopy, immunoblotting, and time-lapse microscopy.

We mutated the aspartic acid in subdomain VII of the catalytic domain to an arginine (Mps1 D664A; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hanks and Hunter, 1995</xref>), a mutation known to inactivate Mps1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Lauze et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abrieu et al., 2001</xref>). When expressed as a GFP-tagged fusion, this mutant localized to the cytoplasm and kinetochores (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). As described in the previous section, we generated stable HeLa cells where the kinase mutant was induced by tetracycline (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>). As before, these cells were transfected with shRNA constructs, the transgene was induced, and the cells were analyzed by time-lapse microscopy. Importantly, induction of the catalytic mutant failed to rescue the SAC defect (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>, right). Rather, the catalytic mutant exacerbated the defect, increasing the number of abnormal mitoses from 63 to 80%. Thus, cells in which the endogenous Mps1 has been replaced by a catalytically inactive mutant are checkpoint deficient, demonstrating that Mps1 kinase activity is required for SAC signaling in human cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Mps1 kinase activity is required for the kinetochore localization of Mad2</title><p>To further probe the role of Mps1, we asked whether the kinase mutant could restore Mad1/Mad2 localization. As described above (see section Mps1 targets Mad1/Mad2 to kinetochores), repression of Mps1 reduced kinetochore-bound Mad1 to &#x0223c;30% (unpublished data). Induction of wild-type Mps1 and the catalytic mutant restored Mad1 localization to &#x0223c;90% and &#x0223c;65%, respectively (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, A and B</xref>). Thus, reconstitution of cells with a catalytically inactive Mps1 mutant results in substantial recruitment of Mad1 to kinetochores, suggesting that Mps1's role in Mad1 localization is only partially dependent on kinase activity. In contrast, kinetochore targeting of Mad2 was largely dependent on Mps1's catalytic activity; whereas the wild-type transgene restored kinetochore-bound Mad2 to &#x0223c;80%, the amount of kinetochore-bound Mad2 in cells expressing the catalytic mutant was only &#x0223c;19% (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, A and B</xref>). To highlight this differential effect, we plotted the amount of kinetochore-bound protein restored by the catalytic mutant as a percentage of that restored by wild-type Mps1 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>). Although the kinase mutant restored Mad1 levels to &#x0223c;75%, Mad2 levels were only restored to &#x0223c;25%. Thus, Mps1 kinase activity appears to play a key role in targeting Mad2 to kinetochores.</p><fig position="float" id="fig3"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>Mps1 kinase activity is required for kinetochore localization of Mad2.</bold> HeLa cells expressing tet-inducible RNAi-resistant GFP-tagged Mps1 fusions were transfected with shRNA vectors, treated with nocodazole for 2 h, and analyzed to detect centromeres (ACA; red) and Mad1 or Mad2 (green).

Therefore, we turned to chemical genetics to selectively block Mps1 activity using an ATP competitive inhibitor. As described previously in budding yeast Mps1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Jones et al., 2005</xref>), we mutated the gate-keeper residue, replacing methionine 602 with an alanine (Mps1<sup>M602A</sup>), thus rendering Mps1 sensitive to the ATP analogue 1-NM-PP1. We generated a stable cell line expressing GFP-tagged Mps1<sup>M602A</sup> under tetracycline control; cells were then cotransfected with vectors encoding Mps1 shRNA and GFP&#x02013;histone H2B and analyzed by time-lapse microscopy to determine checkpoint status. Consistent with the aforementioned data, Mps1 repression inhibited the SAC, with only &#x0223c;30% of cells exhibiting a normal mitosis (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>). Induction of Mps1<sup>M602A</sup> rescued this defect, with &#x0223c;70% of cells completing mitosis normally, indicating that Mps1<sup>M602A</sup> possesses sufficient catalytic activity to sustain the checkpoint. Significantly, 1-NM-PP1 completely reversed the ability of Mps1<sup>M602A</sup> to rescue the checkpoint defect (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>). Furthermore, although Mps1<sup>M602A</sup> restored the kinetochore localization of Mad2, this was reversed by the addition of 1-NM-PP1 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, B and C</xref>). Thus, because Mps1<sup>M602A</sup> restores checkpoint function and Mad2 localization, the M602A mutation does not appear to induce a structural defect. However, because 1-NM-PP1 inhibits SAC function and Mad2 recruitment in cells reconstituted with Mps1<sup>M602A</sup>, the data demonstrate that Mps1's kinase activity is indeed essential for SAC signaling and Mad2 localization.

SP600125 inhibits Mps1 in vitro, raising the possibility that the checkpoint override is induced by Mps1 inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Schmidt et al., 2005</xref>). However, SP600125 inhibits kinetochore localization of BubR1, a phenomenon not phenocopied by Mps1 RNAi (Fig. S2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Martin-Lluesma et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Liu et al., 2003</xref>). If SP600125 does indeed inhibit Mps1 activity in cells, our aforementioned observations predict that SP600125 should mislocalize Mad2. However, at concentrations at which SP600125 overrides the SAC (Fig. S3 C), we observed no obvious effect on the kinetochore recruitment of Mad2 (Fig. S3 D). Clarifying this discrepancy will require further analysis, but our data suggest that SAC override induced by SP600125 may not be the result of Mps1 inhibition.</p></sec><sec><title>Physiological role of Mps1 kinase activity</title><p>Using RNAi complementation and chemical genetics, we show that Mps1 kinase activity is required for SAC function during an unperturbed mitosis, and it is differentially required vis-&#x000e0;-vis kinetochore recruitment of Mad1 and Mad2. Because Mad1 is the kinetochore receptor for Mad2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Musacchio and Salmon, 2007</xref>), Mps1 activity may be required for the Mad1&#x02013;Mad2 interaction. However, this notion is at odds with experiments showing that the Mad1&#x02013;Mad2 interaction can be recapitulated in vitro with recombinant proteins (i.e., in the complete absence of Mps1 activity) in a manner that reproduces Mad2's in vivo dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Vink et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Although Mad1&#x02013;Mad2 binding does not require Mps1 in vitro, it is conceivable that in cells, an Mps1-dependent phosphorylation event may enhance the Mad1-dependent recruitment of Mad2, possibly to amplify checkpoint signaling. Indeed, Mps1 can phosphorylate Mad1 in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hardwick et al., 1996</xref>). Mad2 has been shown to be phosphorylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Wassmann et al., 2003</xref>), raising the possibility that it is a substrate of Mps1. We do not favor this possibility because phospho-Mad2 does not interact with Mad1 and is checkpoint incompetent, suggesting that Mad2 phosphorylation may be involved in checkpoint inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Wassmann et al., 2003</xref>), which is inconsistent with the notion that Mps1 activity stimulates the SAC. The role for Mps1 activity may be indirect. Repression of two recently identified checkpoint components, Plk-interacting checkpoint helicase and Tao1 (a protein kinase), also dislodges Mad2 from kinetochores despite efficient Mad1 recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baumann et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Draviam et al., 2007</xref>). Tao1 appears to be downstream of Mps1, as kinetochore localization of Mps1 does not require Tao1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Draviam et al., 2007</xref>), so Mps1 may influence Mad2 recruitment via Tao1.</p><p>An alternative explanation may come from the fact that our observations are derived using an antibody against Mad2. Thus, it is conceivable that the effect observed in Mps1-deficient cells is not caused by the failure to recruit Mad2 but rather an inability to detect it. Indeed, Mad2 adopts either an open or closed conformation, O-Mad2 and C-Mad2, respectively, which are structurally very different (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Musacchio and Salmon, 2007</xref>). When bound to Mad1, Mad2 adopts the closed conformation and serves as a template, recruiting O-Mad2 to first form a dimer. O-Mad2 is then handed over to Cdc20 and converted to the closed conformation. Therefore, a key question is whether any given anti-Mad2 antibody can recognize both Mad2 conformers. Interestingly, in interphase, Mad1 and Mad2 localize to nuclear pores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Campbell et al., 2001</xref>), as does Mps1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Liu et al., 2003</xref>) and the Mad2 inhibitor p31<sup>comet</sup> (unpublished data). Because p31<sup>comet</sup> binds the Mad1&#x02013;C-Mad2 core complex, thus preventing O-Mad2 recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Mapelli et al., 2006</xref>), this suggests that the species present at the nuclear pore is a Mad1&#x02013;C-Mad2/p31<sup>comet</sup> complex. Significantly, although we can detect Mad1 and p31<sup>comet</sup> at nuclear pores, we cannot detect Mad2 (unpublished data), suggesting that the anti-Mad2 antibody does not recognize C-Mad2. Thus, in cells lacking Mps1 kinase activity, C-Mad2 may well be bound to kinetochores but is simply not detectable by the antibody. Alternatively, because Mad2 oligomerizes when expressed in bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Fang et al., 1998</xref>), the antibody, which was generated against bacterially expressed Mad2, may only recognize the Mad2 dimer. If the anti-Mad2 antibody recognizes only O-Mad2 or the Mad2 dimer, this, in turn, raises an interesting possibility: perhaps Mps1 kinase activity recruits O-Mad2 to the Mad1&#x02013;C-Mad2 core complex, possibly by acting on p31<sup>comet</sup> as opposed to Mad1 and/or Mad2. Although we are currently testing this hypothesis, this issue highlights the need for tools that can distinguish the various conformers of Mad2 in a cell-based assay.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Cell lines and drugs</title><p>hMps1 was PCR amplified from an expressed sequence tag (IMAGE No. 0511705), cloned into a pcDNA5/FRT/TO vector (Invitrogen) modified to contain an N-terminal GFP tag, and mutagenized (QuikChange; Stratagene) to create the D664A-, M602A-, and RNAi-resistant alleles (Table S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200712028/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200712028/DC1</ext-link>).
