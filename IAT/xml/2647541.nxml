They are subdivided into individual glomeruli, which are typical of primary olfactory systems in many animals (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Three principal populations of neurons form synapses in the glomerular neuropile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs) from the olfactory sense organs make synapses with two major types of olfactory interneurons in the antennal lobes, namely the projection neurons (PNs) and the local interneurons (LNs). The PNs receive excitatory input from ORNs and relay olfactory information from the glomeruli to higher brain centres such as the mushroom body and lateral horn. LNs are intrinsic interneurons, which, together with ORNs and PNs, establish a complex synaptic network in the antennal lobe characterised by diverse interglomerular connectivity patterns (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Architecture of the adult <italic>Drosophila </italic>olfactory circuit and local interneurons marked by GAL4-<italic>LN1 </italic>and GAL4-<italic>LN2</italic>. <bold>(A) </bold>Adult brain stained with mAbnc82, which recognizes presynaptic terminals.

In flies, as in mammals, precise neuronal circuitry is established by the ordered axonal projections of ORNs that express a given odorant receptor molecule type to specific target glomeruli in the antennal lobe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In the antennal lobe, comparably precise circuitry is established by the PNs, many of which target their dendrites in a highly stereotyped manner to specific glomeruli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The approximately 150 PNs in <italic>Drosophila </italic>derive from three deutocerebral neuroblasts, the anterodorsal neuroblast (adNb), the lateral neuroblast (lNb) and the ventral neuroblast (vNb). The dendritic targeting specificity of anterodorsal PNs is reported to be pre-specified by lineage and birth order [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Several intrinsic transcription factors as well as gradients of axonal guidance molecules are known to control this PN targeting process independent of ORN axons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. PN axons form spatially highly stereotyped terminal projections in the mushroom body and lateral horn according to the glomeruli that their dendrites innervate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>In contrast to studies on the development of ORNs and PNs, significantly less is known about the cellular and molecular mechanisms that control neurogenesis, process outgrowth and connectivity of the LNs. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, there are thought to be on the order of 100 multiglomerular LNs in each antennal lobe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. There is a growing appreciation of the important functional role of LNs in the transformation of olfactory signals in the antennal lobe. LNs form an extensive network of inhibitory and excitatory synaptic connections with both PNs and ORNs, and these interconnections play central roles in olfactory feature extraction and in shaping odour-evoked activity patterns in the antennal lobe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Some insight into the developmental origin of a subset of these olfactory LNs has been obtained by combining neuroblast ablation with GAL4 reporter labelling. These experiments suggest that the approximately 20 LNs labelled by the GH298 driver could derive from the lNb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Most recently, while this article was under review, Lai and his colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] carried out an extensive clonal analysis to show that the lNb gives rise to a diverse population of cells, including the LNs, uniglomerular and multiglomerular PNs as well as neurons that innervate neuropile outside the antennal lobe.</p><p>In this study, we trace the development of the LNs that innervate the antennal lobe using mosaic analysis with a repressible cell marker (MARCM)-based genetic labelling and mutational techniques combined with antibody markers and neuroblast ablation. Our results support data from Lai <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] indicating that LNs arise from the lNb, which also gives rise to the lateral PNs. We show that the LNs are born throughout the proliferative divisions of the lateral lineage and uniglomerular lateral PNs (lPNs) are generated during later divisions. Moreover, we observed a striking diversity in the innervation patterns of LNs. Finally, we demonstrate that this lineage requires the normal function of the cephalic gap gene <italic>empty spiracles </italic>(<italic>ems</italic>) for LN and lPN development. Our findings lay the groundwork for subsequent analysis of cell intrinsic and non-autonomous cues that could underlie the specification of LNs and PNs in the olfactory system of <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Developmental origin of LNs</title><p>To investigate the development of LNs, we first studied the expression patterns of a number of currently available GAL4 lines &#x02013; GAL4-<italic>NP1227 </italic>(henceforth referred to as GAL4-<italic>LN1</italic>), GAL4-<italic>NP2426 </italic>(referred to as GAL4-<italic>LN2</italic>), <italic>Krasavietz</italic>-GAL4, GAL4-<italic>KL78 </italic>andGAL4-<italic>KL107 </italic>&#x02013; which label populations of cells, including the olfactory LNs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. In these experiments, GAL4 was used to drive a UAS-mCD8::GFP reporter and the monoclonal antibody nc82 was used to highlight the olfactory glomeruli as well as other brain neuropiles. In all cases, the populations of LNs were recognised by their profuse arbors throughout the antennal lobe, which lacked projections outside the glomerular neuropiles (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C,D</xref> and Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1B&#x02013;D</xref>). The somata of the labelled cells with antennal lobe arbors were found clustered in a similar region lateral or dorsolateral to the antennal lobe (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>).</p><p>To analyse the labelled cells further, we focused on the GAL4-<italic>LN1 </italic>and GAL4-<italic>LN2 </italic>lines. GAL4-<italic>LN1 </italic>labels LNs in a lateral cell body cluster of the antennal lobe (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>), while GAL4-<italic>LN2 </italic>labels a large number of LNs in this cluster and a few neurons in the ventral cell body cluster. The GAL4-<italic>LN1 </italic>and GAL4-<italic>LN2 </italic>lines have been characterized to mark a median of 18 (range 14-20) and 38 cells, respectively, in a largely non-overlapping manner with some amount of variability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. We subjected these strains to the mosaic analysis with a repressible cell marker (MARCM) technique to label single cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. These single-cell clones confirmed that the labelled cells were indeed olfactory LNs. Thus, all the cells labelled with GAL4-<italic>LN1 </italic>as well as the lateral population labelled with GAL4-<italic>LN2 </italic>had a single neurite, which extended from the cell body into the glomerular neuropile where it arborised widely in several glomeruli. With the exception of this single cell body neurite, no processes were found outside of the glomerular neuropile. The labelled LNs differed in their putative neurotransmitter as assayed by immunocytochemistry. As expected, in the cell populations labelled by GAL4-<italic>LN1 </italic>or GAL4-<italic>LN2 </italic>many cells showed immunoreactivity characteristic for GABA-ergic transmission (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E1,F1</xref>), but there were also cells that were indicative of cholinergic transmission (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E2,F2</xref>). Cholinergic LNs innervating the antennal lobe have been demonstrated before [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>The consistent location of the somata of the labelled LNs lateral to the antennal lobe suggests that most LNs might derive from one or more Nbs located in the same general region. To investigate this, we carried out Nb ablation experiments comparable to those performed by Stocker <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], but using the GAL4-<italic>LN1 </italic>and GAL4-<italic>LN2 </italic>lines together with a UAS-mCD8::GFP reporter and the mAbnc82 neuropile labelling. In these experiments, the DNA-synthesis inhibitor hydroxyurea (HU) was fed to larvae at 0&#x02013;4 h after larval hatching (ALH). At this stage only five pairs of Nbs, the four mushroom body Nbs and a lateral Nb, are reported to be dividing and are thus prone to ablation by HU [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. In non-treated control adults, GAL4-<italic>LN1 </italic>and GAL4-<italic>LN2 </italic>lines drive expression in approximately 20 and 40 cells, respectively (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2A,C</xref>). In all cases, these cells had widespread multiglomerular arbors in the antennal lobe as expected for olfactory LNs.</p><p>In HU-treated animals, the antennal lobes were often reduced in size and composed of distinctly smaller glomeruli (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2B,D</xref>). The limiting dosage of HU used in our experiments produced some brains in which the effects were restricted to one side of the brain (yellow dotted lines in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>), allowing comparison with an unaffected antennal lobe (blue dotted lines in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). Importantly, whenever a size-reduced antennal lobe was recovered, we observed a near complete absence of labelled LNs; both labelled somata and arborisations in the affected lobe were missing in GAL4-<italic>LN1 </italic>as well as in GAL4-<italic>LN2 </italic>lines. Occasionally, we recovered size-reduced antennal lobes associated with one or two labelled cell bodies, which were probably born before the HU treatment killed the lNb.</p><p>These findings suggest that the approximately 60 olfactory LNs labelled by GAL4-<italic>LN1 </italic>and the lateral population of GAL4-<italic>LN2 </italic>may derive from the lNb. Together with the earlier results of Stocker <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], these data imply that a large proportion of the olfactory LNs could derive from this lateral lineage.</p></sec><sec><title>LNs share a Nb lineage with the lateral cluster of PNs</title><p>If many LNs do indeed derive from the lNb, they would belong to the same lineage as the lPNs that are also generated from these progenitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Hence, the same brain Nb would generate two sets of neuronal progeny that are markedly different in cytoarchitecture, connectivity and function. To investigate this and to determine the proliferation pattern and lineage relationships for LNs and lPNs, we carried out two series of dual expression-control MARCM experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Clones were induced 0&#x02013;4 h ALH and recovered in the adult. In the first series of experiments, GAL4-<italic>LN2 </italic>and ubiquitously expressed <italic>tub</italic>-LexA::GAD were used as drivers (LN2 dual MARCM), thus allowing simultaneous differential labelling of the GAL4-<italic>LN2 </italic>expressing LNs (via GAL4-<italic>LN2</italic>-driven UAS-mCD8) and of all cells in a Nb clone (via <italic>tub</italic>-LexA::GAD-driven lexAop-rCD2::GFP). All of the double-labelled Nb clones recovered in these experiments had similar features. The <italic>tub</italic>-LexA::GAD-driven marker expression labelled an entire Nb clone consisting of a large number of cell bodies (183 &#x000b1; 25; N = 10) located lateral to the antennal lobe. The antennal lobe neuropile was also intensively labelled, indicating that these cells extend numerous processes into the glomeruli (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). The overall morphology of these <italic>tubulin</italic>-labelled clones corresponds to that reported for the postembryonic lNb lineage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. By contrast, the GAL4-<italic>LN2</italic>-driven marker labelled only a subset of cells (approximately 30) in the Nb clone (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). These <italic>LN2</italic>-labelled LNs had cell bodies that were clustered together in the dorsolateral region of the Nb clone next to the antennal lobe (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B2</xref>). The processes of the labelled LNs ramified extensively within the glomeruli, as expected, and did not project out of the antennal lobe.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Local interneurons (LNs) arise from the lateral neuroblast (lNb) lineage. <bold>(A) </bold>The entire lNb clone is visualised by <italic>Tub</italic>-LexA::GAD; LexAop-rCD2GFP (A1).

In order to investigate this, we carried out a second series of dual expression-control MARCM experiments in which GAL4-<italic>GH146 </italic>and <italic>tub</italic>-LexA::GAD were used as drivers (GH146 dual MARCM) in order to differentially label <italic>GH146</italic>-expressing PNs (via GAL4-<italic>GH146</italic>-driven UAS-mCD8) together with all cells in the Nb clone (via <italic>tub</italic>-LexA::GAD-driven lexAop-rCD2::GFP). As expected, three spatially distinct clusters of double-labelled clones were recovered corresponding to the lineages of the adNb, lNb and vNb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. We restricted our analysis to the cluster of labelled cells that represents the lateral neuroblast lineage.</p><p>As expected for this lineage, the <italic>tub</italic>-LexA::GAD-driven marker labelled an entire Nb clone with cell bodies located lateral to the antennal lobe. The intense labelling of the entire antennal lobe neuropile indicates that many of these cells extend numerous processes into the glomeruli as mentioned above in the LN2 dual MARCM experiment. The <italic>GH146</italic>-driven marker labelled only a subset of cells in the Nb clone corresponding to approximately one-fifth of the overall lNb lineage (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). These labelled PNs had cell bodies that were clustered together in a more ventral location of the Nb clone (red in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A4</xref>) and their dendritic processes ramified in only a subset of the antennal glomeruli (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A2</xref>). This type of glomerulus-restricted innervation is expected for the ensemble of <italic>GH146</italic>-labelled uniglomerular lPNs. However, it differs markedly from the type of multiglomerular labelling observed in the corresponding <italic>tubulin</italic>-labelled neuroblast clone, which can only be explained if many multiglomerular neurons such as the LNs, or the multiglomerular PNs described by Lai and his colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], are also present in the lineage.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Projection neurons (PNs) arise together with local interneurons (LNs) from the lateral neuroblast (lNb). <bold>(A) </bold>The entire lNb clone is visualised by <italic>tub</italic>-LexA::GAD; LexAop-rCD2::GFP (A1).

However, multiglomerular PNs arising early in the lineage, as described by Lai and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], were not observed in our study, perhaps because of a lack of appropriate labels for these cells. Hence, while our results suggest that the majority of cells born in the early proliferative period of the lNb might be LNs, it is likely that multi-glomerular PNs not labelled by GAL4-<italic>GH146 </italic>were missed in this analysis. However, we did observe single PNs with oligoglomerular projections (not labelled by GAL4-<italic>GH146</italic>) when clones were induced at 48 h ALH (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6J</xref>). Moreover, careful analysis of labelled Nb clones suggests that there are indeed additional cells in the lateral cluster, as shown previously by Lai <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], which send projections to antennal lobe as well as to unidentified non-olfactory neuropiles both ipsilaterally and contralaterally (reconstructed three-dimensional model in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6K</xref>).</p><p>The early proliferative divisions of the lateral neuroblast (embryo to approximately 24 h ALH) that give rise to LNs are likely to occur according to the canonical division mode, in which the Nb divides asymmetrically to self renew and produce a ganglion mother cell that divides only once to produce two neurons. Correspondingly, we only observed Nb clones or single and two cell LN clones when recombination occurred before 48 h. This may also be the case for some LNs and lPNs generated during the second, later phase of proliferation, since we recovered single-cell and two-cell LN clones as well as single-cell and two-cell lPN clones when recombination was induced at 48 h, 72 h and 96 h ALH. However, during this later proliferation phase, we also recovered samples consisting of 3&#x02013;6 labelled cells (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>). One explanation for this observation could be that there are several ganglion mother cells in the lNb lineage and that more than one of these might be competent for MARCM labelling at the time when recombination was induced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. In order to estimate the number of mitotically competent cells within the lNb lineage, we induced clones at 0&#x02013;4 h ALH and examined the clones in the third instar larval stage after exposing the brains to 5 &#x003bc;g/ml bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) for 1 h. Labelled clones of the lNb contained 5&#x02013;6 BrdU positive cells, comparable to the numbers of BrdU positive cells observed in mushroom body Nb clones (data not shown). This may be indicative of an elevated proliferation rate in this neuroblast, which could lead to an accumulation of mitotically competent ganglion mother cells in the lineage. However, we cannot rule out that the observed 'atypical' multicellular clones are due to proliferative processes that cannot be adequately analysed by current genetic techniques.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T2"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Clones generated in the later phase of proliferation</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left">Clone induced 48 h ALH</td><td align="center">Clone induced at 72 h ALH</td><td align="center">Clone induced at 96 h ALH</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">1 LN, 1 PN (n = 2)</td><td align="center">2 LN, 1 PN (n = 4)</td><td align="center">1 LN, 2 PN (n = 1)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">1 LN, 2 PN (n = 2)</td><td align="center">3 LN, 0 PN (n = 4)</td><td align="center">2 LN, 2 PN (n = 1)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">2 LN, 2 PN (n = 1)</td><td align="center">3 LN, 1 PN (n = 1)</td><td align="center">3 LN, 0 PN (n = 2)</td></tr><tr><td align="left">3 LN, 1 PN (n = 1)</td><td align="center">1 LN, 2 PN (n = 1)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">5 LN, 1 PN (n = 1)</td><td align="center">1 LN, 3 PN (n = 2)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left">6 LN, 0 PN (n = 1)</td><td align="center">5 LN, 0 PN (n = 1)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="center">6 LN, 0 PN (n = 1)</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Cellular compositions of 26 clones, possibly generated from multiple recombination events, obtained from a total of 197 clonal antennal lobes are represented.

These LNs also manifest a surprisingly diverse set of neuronal morphologies as revealed by single-cell MARCM clones. Our findings show that many LNs uniformly innervate the entire antennal lobe. However, in contrast to earlier assumptions, we also find many other LNs that have a more restricted innervation pattern.</p><p>To document this morphological diversity, we carried out a detailed examination of the dendritic projections of 76 labelled LNs in the antennal lobe. Several different types of LNs were found. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref> shows examples of LNs that innervate the entire ipsilateral antennal lobe without a distinct glomerular innervation pattern. These correspond to the multiglomerular-type A LNs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref> shows examples of LNs that innervate large regions of the ipsilateral antennal lobe but their processes exclude specific glomerular regions. These may correspond to mutliglomerular-type B LNs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. A third type of LN is oligoglomerular and has a more restricted innervation pattern. As shown in figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C</xref>, LNs of this type innervate only a part of the ipsilateral antennal lobe and, correspondingly, project to only a subset of the olfactory glomeruli. Finally, in figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7D</xref>, we show an example of the LN type that innervates the ipsilateral antennal lobe and, in addition, sends processes into the contralateral antennal lobe.</p><fig position="float" id="F7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p>Heterogeneity of local interneurons (LNs).

At late third larval instar stages, lNb clones contain approximately 200 neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], which are largely conserved in the adult. The finding that a substantial proportion of the olfactory interneurons present in the adult brain, namely a majority of the LNs and a large percentage of PNs, derive from the same lNb lineage underscores this fact and highlights the role of the lNb in producing an ensemble of neurons with important roles in olfactory processing.</p></sec><sec><title>Differences in birth order of LNs and lPNs</title><p>Given that LNs and PNs can be generated by the same Nb, it is interesting that uniglomerular lPNs are only generated in the later proliferative phase of the lNb. Single-cell and double-cell MARCM clones induced in the lNb lineage in the embryo or early larval stages (0&#x02013;24 h ALH) were composed of LNs, and Lai and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] described the birth of diverse atypical PNs during this period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. However, lPNs were only recovered if the clones were induced at 48 h or later. In other cases in which the neuron types generated by identified Nbs have been characterised, early born neurons are usually projection interneurons or motoneurons, which often pioneered central nervous system tracts or peripheral nerves, whereas local interneurons are usually among the later born neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Previous work has shown that PNs target their dendrites to specific regions of the antennal lobe before the arrival of their partner ORN axons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. It is noteworthy that LNs are also present at the lobe at this time and, in the case of the lPNs, perhaps earlier. The possible role of LNs in pattering the synaptic structures in the antennal lobe has not yet been studied.</p><p>During the second larval instar stage (between 24 h and 48 h ALH), an alteration in proliferation competence appears to occur in the lNb, and production of uniglomerular lPNs is initiated along with the ongoing and continuing production of LNs in this lineage. It is noteworthy that in the adult brain, cell bodies of the early born LNs were markedly larger in size than those of the lPNs (compare cells marked with pink and yellow asterisks in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). Previous reports have demonstrated that in several Nb lineages, the early born neurons are significantly larger in size than their later born siblings, and it will now be important to determine if the temporal series of transcription factors regulates this and other key events in LN and lPN development in the lNb lineage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Morphological diversity of LNs</title><p>LNs are important elements in the olfactory system; they interconnect glomeruli in the antennal lobe and have specific roles in modifying the information flow between ORNs and PNs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. An appreciation of their morphological complexity and diversity can be attained by using GAL4 lines to selectively label these neurons either as populations or, in combination with MARCM techniques, as single-cell and double-cell clones. When large populations of LNs are targeted, these labelling techniques show that ensembles of LNs establish dense dendritic arborisations throughout the antennal lobes.</p><p>When individual LNs are labelled, complex arbors throughout the olfactory glomeruli are also observed in many cases, underlining the multiglomerular nature of specific LNs. However, labelling of individual neurons also clearly reveals a hitherto unexpected degree of morphological diversity of LNs. Thus, careful examination of the extent of the dendritic arbors of single LNs shows that there are at least two different types of multiglomerular LNs. Moreover, many examples of oligoglomerular LNs manifesting different degrees of innervations of restricted sets of glomeruli as well as LNs with ipsilateral and contralateral innervations have now been found.</p><p>The remarkable morphological diversity of LNs, together with the fact that LNs express different neurotransmitters, implies that this cell type might play important roles in olfactory information processing that were not appreciated in earlier studies. This notion, together with the possibility that the innervation of individual LNs might be much more variable than currently assumed, will be important areas for further studies.</p></sec><sec><title>Conserved roles of ems in olfactory system development</title><p>Despite the obvious difference in their morphology, LNs and PNs do share at least one important developmental genetic feature. The correct development of both cell types requires the cephalic gap gene <italic>ems</italic>. The <italic>ems </italic>gene, which encodes a homeodomain transcription factor, is known to be expressed in the anterodorsal and lateral Nbs and has cell lineage-specific functions in postembryonic PN development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. In the adNb lineage, <italic>ems </italic>expression is required for precise targeting of PN dendrites to appropriate glomeruli. In the lNb lineage, <italic>ems </italic>is essential for development of the correct number of PNs. The results of our experiments indicate that <italic>ems </italic>is also essential for the development of the correct number of LNs within this lineage. Thus, both types of olfactory interneurons in the first order olfactory centre of the <italic>Drosophila </italic>brain require Ems for proper development. Indeed, given that the <italic>ems </italic>gene is also expressed in the developing cephalic segment from which the antennal sense organs derive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>], the same gene might be important for the development of all three principal populations of neurons that form synapses in the antennal lobe neuropile, ORNs, PNs and LNs.</p><p>The organization of the olfactory system in insects and mammals is surprisingly similar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. ORNs that express a given odorant receptor send axons to the same glomeruli located in the first order olfactory centre of the brain (antennal lobe in insects, olfactory bulb in mammals). There, ORNs make specific synapses with the dendrites of two types of second order olfactory neurons, the local interneurons (LNs in insects, periglomerular cells in mammals) and the projection neurons (PNs in insects, mitral/tufted cells in mammals). Genes of the <italic>ems</italic>/<italic>Emx </italic>family are required for proper development of the first order olfactory centre in both insects and mammals. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, <italic>ems </italic>loss-of-function leads to perturbations in LN and PN development and, hence, significant reduction in antennal lobe size. In the mouse, <italic>Emx1 </italic>and <italic>Emx2 </italic>double mutants have marked deficits in growth and lamination of the olfactory bulb; the mitral cell layer, external plexiform layer and glomerular layer are thin and poorly organised [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. The strikingly similar expression and function of the <italic>ems</italic>/<italic>Emx </italic>genes in the development of the primary olfactory centres in insects and mammals argue for evolutionarily conserved roles of these gene homologues in olfactory system development.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have demonstrated that the lNb of the deutocerebrum gives rise to LNs and PNs that contribute to the olfactory circuit of <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Moreover, we have shown that LNs display a remarkable morphological diversity. LN formation is initiated early in the life of the lNb, while uniglomerular PNs are detected only after approximately 48 h ALH. The formation of both cell types in this neuroblast lineage is determined by the function of the <italic>ems </italic>gene.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Fly strains and genetics</title><p>All stocks, unless otherwise mentioned, were obtained from the Bloomington Stock Centre, Indiana, USA.
