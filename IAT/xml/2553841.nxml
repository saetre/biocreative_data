Our model seeks to capture all key interactions and protein movements identified in experimental studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060235-g002">Figure 2</xref>). The nature of the regulation of <italic>WER</italic> transcription is central to our model. <italic>WER</italic> transcription is repressed by both SCM and CPC, but no specific activators of <italic>WER</italic> transcription have been identified. To address directly the open question of the necessity for WER autoregulation, we consider two alternative forms of <italic>WER</italic> regulation. In the first version, we assume local <italic>WER</italic> self-activation, implemented by the enhancement of <italic>WER</italic> transcription by WER-complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060235-g002">Figures 2</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060235-g003">3</xref>A). In this scenario, CPC down-regulates <italic>WER</italic> indirectly via competition for TTG/GL3/EGL3. In the second version, we do not include local <italic>WER</italic> self-activation, assuming instead that <italic>WER</italic> transcription is activated uniformly in all epidermal cells, with both CPC and SCM (in the H-position cells) repressing <italic>WER</italic> transcription directly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060235-g002">Figures 2</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060235-g003">3</xref>B).

First, since the expression pattern of TTG within the epidermis is not known, we assume that it is expressed uniformly and that it plays only a permissive role in allowing the formation of WER and CPC protein complexes with GL3/EGL3. On the basis of this assumption, we do not include an explicit TTG variable in our mathematical model. TTG is, however, present implicitly in all the cells of our model epidermis. Second, we do not include the CPC-complex explicitly in the model; rather, we represent the ability of CPC to compete with WER for binding to TTG/GL3/EGL3 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060235-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d; by a direct inhibition of WER-complex formation by CPC. The CPC-complex is implicitly present in all model cells that express both CPC and GL3/EGL3. Third, GL3 and EGL3, which act in a partially redundant manner &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060235-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;, are represented by a single network component. Similarly, the three MYB proteins CPC, TRIPTYCHON (TRY), and ENHANCER OF TRY AND CPC1 (ETC1), which act in a partially redundant manner &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060235-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;, are also represented by a single network component (denoted by CPC).</p><p>In order to incorporate the observed intercellular movement of the CPC and GL3/EGL3 proteins, we have imposed a specific mechanism in our model: both CPC and GL3/EGL3 proteins are moved actively out of the cells in which they are produced (translated). We adopt this active mechanism to reflect the observed accumulation of these proteins in the nuclei of cells <italic>neighbouring</italic> the cells in which they are produced. A GL3-YFP fusion protein, expressed under the <italic>GL3</italic> promoter in a <italic>gl3</italic> mutant background, accumulates in the nuclei of N-position cells, even though the corresponding mRNA is restricted to H-position cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060235-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;. Similarly, a HA-tagged CPC protein, expressed under the <italic>CPC</italic> promoter in a <italic>cpc</italic> mutant background, accumulates in the nuclei of H cells, even though its mRNA is restricted to N cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060235-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;. A CPC-GFP fusion protein can be observed in the nuclei of both cell types &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060235-b009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060235-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;. However, this protein is expressed at much higher levels than the endogenous CPC protein (due perhaps to protein stabilisation) and causes numerous cells in the N position to adopt the trichoblast fate &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060235-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;. These experimental results demonstrate that both CPC and GL3 proteins move away from their sites of production, but the mechanism by which they do this is not known. Given this uncertainty, we have incorporated in our model a simple movement scheme that captures the observed complementary patterns of protein production and accumulation. Possible molecular mechanisms underlying this scheme are discussed below.</p><p>We simulate a ring of 16 epidermal cells (which we refer to as the epi-net) following its emergence from the meristem. This represents the stereotypical number of cells found in each epidermal ring in the apical region of the seedling root in which patterning takes place &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060235-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060235-b002">2</xref>&#x0005d;. As the cells age (and so move further away from the root apex), occasional anticlinal cell divisions can occur, increasing the number of cells in an epidermal ring &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060235-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060235-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d; (the cross-section in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060235-g001">Figure 1</xref> shows an example of an older epidermal ring in which this has occurred). However, since we are here modelling the earliest stages of patterning in the epidermis, we do not consider these later events explicitly. Each simulated cell (referred to as a cell-net) contains all the components of the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> root hair patterning network shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060235-g002">Figure 2</xref>, and so in a simulated cell, any combination of components can be expressed, including the combinations specific to trichoblast or atrichoblast cells. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060235-g003">Figure 3</xref> shows the network state (expression of network components and active interactions) in cell-nets corresponding to epidermal cells that have adopted either a stable trichoblast or atrichoblast fate. The mechanistic differences between the local <italic>WER</italic> self-activation and mutual support models are clearly visible in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060235-g003">Figure 3</xref>.</p><p>Since mechanistic details (such as rate laws and the corresponding kinetic parameters) of the epidermal interaction network are not known, a model based on differential equations would involve a large number of unknown parameters. Instead, we adopt a modelling framework that encodes the logical form of interactions. At a given time, the components of a cell-net are either expressed or not. Components that have only positive regulatory inputs (WER, GL3/EGL3, <italic>CPC</italic>, CPC, <italic>GL2</italic>, and GL2&#x02014;see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060235-g002">Figure 2</xref>) are expressed if their direct positive regulators are expressed. For example, if <italic>WER</italic> (mRNA) is expressed in a cell-net, then WER (protein) will be expressed. <italic>GL3/EGL3</italic> has one negative input (the WER-complex) and is expressed if its input is not. To specify similar logical rules for the expression of the two components (<italic>WER</italic> and WER-complex) whose production is regulated by a combination of positive and negative regulators would involve making arbitrary assumptions about the dominance of activators or repressors (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060235-sd001">Protocol S1</xref>). To avoid this, and to allow scope for investigating the effects of any assumptions we make about dominance, we adopt a stochastic formalism in which these components each have a time-evolving probability of expression. The probability of a component being expressed corresponds to the average abundance of that component in the cell. In our formalism, the change in probability over time is determined by the expression of the component's direct regulators and the corresponding activation/inhibition &#x0201c;rates&#x0201d; (which encode the relative strengths of the regulatory interactions). For example, the probability of the WER-complex being expressed is increased by a small amount if both GL3/EGL3 and WER are expressed, and decreased by a small amount if both GL3/EGL3 and CPC are expressed. The incorporation of stochasticity in our model not only increases the investigative scope, but also supplies a form of noise, which is an inherent feature of biological systems and is an integral part of cell differentiation. Furthermore, this stochasticity plays an important role in triggering fate assignment in our model of the <italic>scm</italic> mutant, which lacks positional cues from the cortical cells (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060235-sd001">Protocol S1</xref>). However, the formalism that we adopt is not intended to provide a detailed representation of the stochastic nature of molecular dynamics in a cell. A detailed description of the modelling formalism and equations can be found in Materials and Methods.</p><p>Our stochastic Boolean formalism provides a versatile setting in which to investigate the effects of the relative strengths of combinatorial regulators for a specified regulatory logic. However, the results that we obtain from the model are not dependent on the use of this specific formalism. In particular, the behaviour of the model epidermis can be produced using Boolean models with appropriately chosen deterministic logical functions. In this case, the stochasticity needed to trigger patterning in the <italic>scm</italic> mutant epidermis can be introduced by adopting an asynchronous update scheme (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060235-sd001">Protocol S1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Simulation of Wild-Type and Mutant Epidermal Cell Fate Patterning</title><p>To assess the ability of the model networks to account for observed wild-type expression patterns, we simulated epi-nets in which all network components (except SCM) were initially expressed at the same level in all cells (i.e., all cell-nets are initially identical). To represent the positional bias received from the underlying cortex, SCM was set to be active only in cells located in the H position, resulting in a lower transcription rate of <italic>WER</italic> than in the N position. In an epi-net, H and N positions alternate: odd-numbered cell-nets are in the H position, while even-numbered cell-nets are in the N position (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060235-g004">Figure 4</xref>). With this imposed positional bias, both the local <italic>WER</italic> self-activation and mutual support models are capable of generating stable expression patterns that agree with the expression patterns observed in experimental data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060235-g004">Figure 4</xref>).</p><fig id="pbio-0060235-g004" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Time-Course Expression Patterns of Network Components in a Simulated Wild-Type Ring of Epidermal Cells</title><p>Time (in arbitrary units) is displayed on the vertical axis and cell position in the epidermal ring along the horizontal axis (the cells at the left- and right-hand ends are actually neighbours in the epidermal ring).

LALI mechanisms depend on interlinked positive feedback (short range) and negative feedback (long range) whereas LIF depends on a single &#x0201c;double-negative&#x0201d; feedback loop, mediated by intercellular signalling, and does not depend on local self-activation. The logical structure of the LIF mechanism is analogous to the Delta-Notch signalling system in animal epithelia, in which proneural activity in one cell represses proneural activity in its neighbours through the transmembrane ligand Delta and its receptor Notch, ensuring directional signalling. Models of the Delta-Notch system exhibit spontaneous patterning that does not depend on any local self-activation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060235-b020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060235-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>In the LALI mechanism, the &#x0201c;activated&#x0201d; cell state (atrichoblast) inhibits its neighbours, which adopt an alternative fate (trichoblast). In contrast, in the LIF mechanism, cells adopting one of the two epidermal fates are mutually supporting, producing factors required by cells adopting the alternative fate. Adoption of the atrichoblast fate (high WER-complex) requires GL3/EGL3 from neighbouring cells; adoption of the trichoblast fate (low WER-complex) requires CPC from neighbouring cells (to prevent accumulation of WER-complex). In other words, a cell can only have high levels of WER-complex if a neighbouring cell has a low level of WER-complex and vice versa. This model therefore predicts that &#x0201c;runs&#x0201d; of three or more epidermal cells with similar levels of WER-complex should not occur. In the root apical meristem, where the early patterning of gene expression in the epidermis occurs, each ring of epidermal cells contains 16 cells, with alternating cells in H and N positions, as encoded in our model &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060235-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;. We therefore observe a strict alternating pattern in our wild-type simulations that incorporate a positional bias from the cortex. In the simulated <italic>scm</italic> mutant, which lacks cortical bias, we do not observe more than two cells of the same fate neighbouring each other. In growing roots, the number of cells in an epidermal ring tends to increase as cells move away from the root apical meristem, due to occasional anticlinal cell divisions &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060235-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060235-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d;. This is shown clearly in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060235-g001">Figure 1</xref>, in which most H-position cells are separated by two N-position cells. In older epidermal rings, three or more adjacent cells are sometimes observed to have the same pattern of gene expression, which cannot be accounted for by our early patterning network in its current form. However, it is likely that once the basic pattern of expression of the core epidermal patterning components has been established, cell fate is stabilised by additional factors such as chromatin modification &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060235-b023">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060235-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d;. Such fate stabilisation mechanisms would allow cells to maintain their network state even when no longer supported by a neighbouring cell of the alternate fate.</p><p>We have shown by model simulation that the LALI mechanism (incorporating local <italic>WER</italic> self-activation) fails to account fully for the previously reported phenotype of a <italic>cpc</italic> mutant root, and by experiment that a specific form of local self-activation (WER-mediated up-regulation of <italic>WER</italic> transcription) does not operate in the early patterning of the root epidermis. Our combined modelling and experimental results favour an alternative mechanism (LIF) in which the two emerging cell fates mutually support each other through the active exchange of the mobile proteins CPC and GL3. The mutual support model predicts patterns of WER promoter activity in <italic>wer</italic>, <italic>gl3 egl3</italic>, and <italic>ttg</italic> mutant roots that are similar to wild type. We have verified these predictions experimentally, providing validation for the model and further support for our proposed patterning mechanism. Importantly, the model based on the LALI mechanism does not account for these new observations.</p><p>The mutual support model incorporates the active movement of the CPC and GL3 proteins from the cells in which they are produced to neighbouring cells. Such an active mechanism is suggested by the previously reported complementary patterns of production and accumulation of these proteins in the epidermis. We have adopted a modelling formalism based on binary states of expression (&#x0201c;on&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;off&#x0201d;). In this formalism, the patterning of the model epidermis depends on this active mechanism of protein movement. However, the possibility remains that the observed complementary patterns of protein production and accumulation could result from simple diffusion of the proteins between cells, together with sequestration of the proteins into nuclear-localised protein complexes (as occurs in the directed movement of the SHORTROOT protein in the root apical meristem &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060235-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d;).</p><p>Previous theoretical discussions of epidermal patterning have proposed that local self-activation is a necessary feature of a patterning mechanism &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060235-b014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060235-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;. This conclusion is based on the theory of two-component activator&#x02013;inhibitor models in which movement is purely diffusive. To explore the validity of this conclusion for the root epidermal patterning network, we have analysed two different mathematical representations of the mutual support model. First, we have developed a logical state (Boolean) model in which CPC and GL3 protein movement depends on a movement parameter, allowing both active and passive (diffusion-like) movement to be represented. Analysis of this model shows that passive GL3 movement is sufficient to account for patterning, so long as CPC moves actively (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060235-sd001">Protocol S1</xref>). Second, we have developed a reaction&#x02013;diffusion analogue of our logical model in which both GL3 and CPC move between cells by simple diffusion alone (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060235-sd001">Protocol S1</xref>). When reduced to an effective two-component model for GL3 and CPC (by assuming that protein complex formation and WER dynamics reach equilibrium much faster than diffusive processes), we show that the model can take the form of a cross activator&#x02013;inhibitor system, which is capable of spontaneous pattern formation via diffusion-driven instability &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060235-b027">27</xref>&#x0005d;. This analysis shows that the mutual support mechanism we propose can generate pattern spontaneously by diffusive protein movement and protein complex formation, in the absence of any local self-activation reaction. Numerical simulation of both the full and reduced models confirms that the diffusive mechanism generates stable patterns with protein distributions that match those observed in the root epidermis (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060235-sd001">Protocol S1</xref>).</p><p>Our results serve to highlight the importance of a detailed investigation of the mechanisms of the intercellular movement of proteins such as CPC and GL3/EGL3 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060235-b028">28</xref>&#x0005d;. A number of simple mechanisms might underlie an effective directionality of protein movement away from producing cells. For example, the movement of proteins through plasmodesmata could be dependent on a chaperone protein that is produced only in cells producing the mobile protein. Alternatively, passage through plasmodesmata could depend on localisation of the protein in the endoplasmic reticulum, which would favour movement away from the cells in which the protein is translated. An intriguing parallel is provided by the movement of small metabolites through small intercellular pores (microplasmodesmata) in the filamentous cyanobactoria <italic>Anabaena</italic>. A recent study has shown that the permeability of pores (and hence the mobility of metabolites) mirrors the states of differentiation of the two cell types in this system &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060235-b029">29</xref>&#x0005d;. In particular, as individual cells in the filament move towards a differentiated heterocyst fate, the permeability of pores between emerging heterocysts and neighbouring vegetative cells decreases compared to that between two vegetative cells. Thus, in this very different system, differential permeability of intercellular channels, dependent on cell fate, can establish spatially patterned protein distributions.

The state of the corresponding protein carries an appended &#x0201c;p&#x0201d; (for example, WERp<italic><sup>t</sup><sub>j</sub></italic> represents the state of WER protein at time <italic>t</italic> in cell-net <italic>j</italic>). The state of the WER-complex is denoted by WERc. In order to capture what we believe to be the essential logic of the epidermal patterning network, while keeping the number of distinct molecular species in the model to a minimum, a number of known network components have been left out of the model, or combined into a single model variable. Both GL3 and EGL3 are represented jointly by a single model element GL3 (comprising variables for mRNA and protein). We justify this simplification by noting that all published data suggest that GL3 and EGL3 are regulated similarly and exhibit functional redundancy. Similarly, we represent the three single-repeat R3 MYB proteins CPC, TRIPTYCHON (TRY), and ENHANCER OF TRY AND CPC1 (ETC1) by a single model element CPC, since experimental evidence supports the idea that they act collectively and redundantly to specify the trichoblast fate &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060235-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;. Furthermore, in the absence of experimental data to the contrary, we assume that the WD-repeat protein TRANSPARENT TESTA GLABRA (TTG), an essential component of the WER-complex, is expressed uniformly throughout the epidermis. This assumption renders the explicit representation of TTG in the models unnecessary, and our models do not contain TTG variables (although the protein is implicitly assumed to be present in all cells).</p><p>To investigate the patterning potential of the local <italic>WER</italic> self-activation and mutual support models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060235-g002">Figure 2</xref>), we use a discrete-time logical formalism. In this approach, the state of each network component is represented by a binary variable taking either value 1 (component expressed) or 0 (not expressed). Time evolution of the network state is modelled by the synchronous update of the state of each network component at equally spaced time points (<italic>t</italic>, <italic>t</italic>&#x0002b;1, <italic>t</italic>&#x0002b;2, &#x02026;). For the network components whose state is regulated by only one other component type (WERp, <italic>GL3</italic>, GL3p, <italic>CPC</italic>, or CPCp), we adopt a conventional deterministic Boolean update formalism &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060235-b032">32</xref>&#x0005d;. For the two components whose state is regulated by more than one input (<italic>WER</italic> and WERc), we adopt a novel formalism based on the <italic>probability P<sup>t</sup><sub>j</sub></italic>&#x0005b;X&#x0005d; that the state of component <italic>X<sup>t</sup><sub>j</sub></italic> will be 1 at time <italic>t</italic>. Rather than specifying a deterministic function for the time evolution of the states of these components, we instead specify a deterministic rule for the time evolution of the probability of expression. This form of update allows us both to vary the relative strengths of the inputs and to incorporate stochasticity in the update process. Although this approach directly introduces stochasticity into the evolution equations of only two network variables, the stochasticity filters through to the other components. Thus, whereas all components could be represented probabilistically, this would necessitate the introduction of many more undetermined parameters without adding further functionality to the model. In a simulation of the network, the actual values (0 or 1) of <italic>WER<sup>t</sup><sub>j</sub></italic> and WERc<italic><sup>t</sup><sub>j</sub></italic> are determined stochastically at each time step according to the probability of expression, <italic>P<sup>&#x0200a;t</sup><sub>j</sub></italic>&#x0005b;<italic>WER</italic>&#x0005d; and <italic>P&#x0200a;<sup>t</sup><sub>j</sub></italic>&#x0005b;WERc&#x0005d;.</p><p>The parameters in our probabilistic update functions (see below) allow us to explore the robustness of patterning to changes in the relative strengths of the inputs. Furthermore, the incorporation of stochasticity into the system is important, since stochasticity is an inherent feature of biological networks and is required in our models to initiate patterning in the simulated <italic>scm</italic> mutant. However, our approach does not attempt to mimic any specific form of stochasticity found in biological systems, and we have shown that the results obtained using our probabilistic formalism can be reproduced by using a deterministic Boolean model with stochasticity introduced in the form of asynchronous state update (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060235-sd001">Protocol S1</xref>).</p><p>Our probabilistic Boolean formalism provides a simple way of exploring the consequences of specific assumptions about the regulatory logic of the epidermal patterning network. However, the use of a logical (on/off) representation of the network state assumes that the regulatory interactions represented in the model (e.g., transcription and translation) are essentially &#x0201c;all or nothing.&#x0201d; Since our primary objective is to explore the <italic>differences</italic> between two alternative network structures, we believe that this assumption is appropriate. Other approaches to modelling regulatory networks, such as those based on differential equations, do not depend on such an assumption being made. However, these models require the specification of many more parameters than our model, to represent the details of specific interaction kinetics. Such models can provide more-realistic representations of the dynamical evolution of the state of the network. Given that there are currently no data, either from which appropriate parameters can be specified, or against which detailed network dynamics can be validated, we do not believe that these approaches currently have a significant advantage over our logical formalism.</p><p>The local <italic>WER</italic> self-activation and mutual support models are defined in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pbio-0060235-e001">Equations (1)</xref> and <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pbio-0060235-e002">(2)</xref>, respectively. The models are identical apart from the equation encoding the time-evolution of <italic>WER</italic> mRNA. The symbol &#x02228; represents the logical &#x0201c;inclusive OR&#x0201d; function (i.e., A&#x02228;B &#x0003d; 0 if and only if A &#x0003d; B &#x0003d; 0). <italic>c</italic><sub>0</sub>, <italic>c</italic><sub>1</sub>,...<italic>c</italic><sub>5</sub>, are positive parameters that determine the relative strengths of the inputs in the probabilistic multi-input update functions for <italic>WER</italic> and WERc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060235-g002">Figure 2</xref>). The constant terms <italic>c</italic><sub>1</sub> and <italic>c</italic><sub>5</sub> represent either constitutive production or degradation, depending on their preceding signs. The regulatory inputs to <italic>WER</italic> and WERc specify the amount by which the probability of expression of these components <italic>changes</italic> during a single time step. This form of update rule is similar to the rate equations that form the basis of differential equation models (in which the rate of change of a component is determined by the values of its direct regulators). Values within the brackets &#x0230a; &#x0230b; are forced to remain between 0 and 1.</p><disp-formula id="pbio-0060235-e001"><graphic xlink:href="pbio.0060235.e001.jpg" position="anchor" mimetype="image"/></disp-formula><disp-formula id="pbio-0060235-e002"><graphic xlink:href="pbio.0060235.e002.jpg" position="anchor" mimetype="image"/></disp-formula><p>A positional bias from the underlying cortex is incorporated in the models via the state of the SCRAMBLED (SCM) receptor-like kinase, which is taken to be 1 in cell nets occupying the H position and 0 in cell-nets occupying the N position. Activity of SCM results in a reduction in the rate of transcription of <italic>WER</italic>, determined by the parameter <italic>c</italic><sub>0</sub>. We assume the two positions to be arranged alternately, as is typically the case in the apical root epidermis (anticlinal cell divisions in the epidermis, which can increase the spacing between H-position cells, typically occur further from the meristem, where the expression pattern of network components has already stabilised).</p><p>The initial state of all components, bar SCM (see above), is identical in all cell-nets, representing the fact that the final stable state of each cell-net is determined by its position relative to the underlying cortical cells rather than cell lineage. As the state of each cell-net evolves in time, the cell-nets adopt stable patterns of expression corresponding to either the trichoblast or atrichoblast cell fate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060235-g004">Figure 4</xref>).
