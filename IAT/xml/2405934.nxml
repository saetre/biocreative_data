Apart of its well characterized enzymatic activity, heparanase was noted to exert also enzymatic-independent functions. Non-enzymatic activities of heparanase include enhanced adhesion of tumor-derived cells and primary T-cells. Attempting to identify functional domains of heparanase that would serve as targets for drug development, we have identified heparin binding domains of heparanase. A corresponding peptide (residues Lys<sup>158</sup>-Asp<sup>171</sup>, termed KKDC) was demonstrated to physically associate with heparin and HS, and to inhibit heparanase enzymatic activity. We hypothesized that the pro-adhesive properties of heparanase are mediated by its interaction with cell surface HS proteoglycans, and utilized the KKDC peptide to examine this possibility. We provide evidence that the KKDC peptide interacts with cell membrane HS, resulting in clustering of syndecan-1 and syndecan-4. We applied classical analysis of cell morphology, fluorescent and time-lapse microscopy and demonstrated that the KKDC peptide efficiently stimulates the adhesion and spreading of various cell types, mediated by PKC, Src, and the small GTPase Rac1. These results support, and further substantiate the notion that heparanase function is not limited to its enzymatic activity.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Proteoglycans are proteins that bear long, un-branched sugar polymers, glycosaminoglycans, which are attached to specific serine residues of the protein core <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002319-Selleck1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Glycosaminoglycans are polymers of disaccharide units. In the case of heparan sulfate, uronic acid (either glucuronic acid or iduronic acid) and N-acetyl glucosamine repeats compose the basic structure of the proteoglycan. Despite the seemingly simple, single repeating structural motif, these sugar polymers show a great deal of structural diversity generated by complex pattern of deacetylation, sulfation, and epimerization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002319-Selleck1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, a single heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) side chain contains distinct structural domains, composed of regions of highly sulfated, negatively-charged residues alongside of regions with modest levels of sugar modifications. Proteoglycans are abundant components of the basement membrane and extracellular matrix (ECM) of epithelium, endothelium, and connective tissues including cartilage, tendons, and bones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002319-Kjellen1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002319-Jackson1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, proteoglycans are also abundantly present on the cell surface, providing an important constituent of the cell's sugar coat involved in various aspects of cellular and molecular activities at the cell-ECM interface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002319-Sasisekharan1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. By interacting with other macromolecules such as laminin, fibronectin, and collagens I and IV, HSPGs contribute to the structural integrity, self-assembly and insolubility of the ECM and basement membrane, thus intimately modulating cell-ECM interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002319-Bernfield1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002319-Timpl1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. ECM constituents are, however, only one class of HS-binding molecules. In fact, numerous enzymes, growth factors, cytokines and chemokines are sequestered by HSPGs on the cell surface and ECM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002319-Selleck1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002319-Sasisekharan1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002319-Capila1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002319-Cardin1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. In general, HSPGs facilitate the biological activity of bound ligands by actively participating in receptor-ligand complex formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002319-Belting1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. In other cases, HSPGs mediate cellular uptake and catabolism of selected ligands <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002319-Belting1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, or sequester polypeptides to the ECM and cell surface as an inactive reservoir <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002319-Vlodavsky1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002319-Vlodavsky3">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Cleavage of HSPGs would ultimately release these proteins and convert them into bioactive mediators, ensuring rapid tissue response to local or systemic cues. The protein core of HSPGs is susceptible to cleavage by several classes of proteases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002319-PageMcCaw1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002319-Werb1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. An additional mode of HSPGs cleavage is offered by the enzyme heparanase.</p><p>Heparanase is an endo-&#x003b2;-glucuronidase that cleaves HS side chains presumably at sites of low sulfation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002319-McKenzie1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, releasing saccharide products with appreciable size (5&#x02013;7 kDa) that can still associate with protein ligands and modulate their biological potency. Heparanase activity has been traditionally correlated with cell invasion associated with cancer metastasis, a consequence of structural modification that loosens the ECM barrier <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002319-BarNer1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002319-Vlodavsky4">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. More recently, heparanase up-regulation was documented in an increasing number of human carcinomas and hematological malignancies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002319-McKenzie1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002319-Ilan1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002319-Vlodavsky5">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. In many cases, heparanase induction correlated with increased tumor metastasis, vascular density, and shorter post operative survival rate, thus providing a strong clinical support for the pro-metastatic and pro-angiogenic function of the enzyme <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002319-Ilan1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002319-Vlodavsky5">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition to the well studied catalytic feature of the enzyme, heparanase was noted to exert biological functions apparently independent of its enzymatic activity.

We hypothesized that the pro-adhesive properties of heparanase are mediated by its interaction with cell surface HSPGs and utilized the unique feature of the KKDC peptide to examine this possibility.</p><p>Syndecans are a family of four transmembrane proteins capable of carrying chondroitin sulfate (CS) and HS chains. Syndecans are expressed on virtually all cell types throughout development and adulthood, and their expression can be altered under certain pathophysiological conditions, including tumor onset, progression, and metastasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002319-Beauvais1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002319-Couchman1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. The presence of HS chains allows interactions with a large number of proteins, including heparin-binding growth factors, plasma proteins such as antithrombin, and extracellular matrix proteins including fibronectin. In addition, syndecans are thought to function as co-receptors, facilitating growth factors, morphogens, and integrins activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002319-Beauvais1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002319-Saoncella1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, syndecans can associate with a large number of adaptor and signaling molecules through their cytolplasmic tail, despite being relatively small. These include ezrin, tubulin, cortactin, PDZ domain-containing proteins (i.e., syntenin), Src and PKC&#x003b1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002319-Tkachenko1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002319-Woods1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. Syndecans emerge as central players in the interactions between the ECM and the cell surface that ultimately regulate cell spreading, adhesion, and migration. This function was largely attributed to a direct interaction of syndecans with matrix proteins such as fibronectin. In addition, clustering of syndecan-4 has been shown to initiate signaling cascades that results in PKC&#x003b1; and Rac1 activation that appears instrumental for cell adhesion and directional migration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002319-Tkachenko1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002319-Tkachenko2">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Here, we provide evidence that the KKDC peptide interacts with plasma membrane HS, and facilitates clustering of syndecan-1 and syndecan-4. Interestingly, while the heparanase-syndecan complex is subjected to rapid internalization and appears in endocytic vesicles short after the addition of heparanase, the KKDC peptide elicits syndecan clusters that remain on the cell surface for a relatively long period of time and fail to get internalized. We demonstrate that the KKDC peptide efficiently stimulates the adhesion and spreading of multiple cell types by activating the PKC pathway and the small GTPase Rac1. These results support and further expand the notion that heparanase function is not limited to its enzymatic activity, and highlight heparin binding domains as targets for the development of anti-cancer inhibitors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Antibodies and reagents</title><p>Anti syndecan-1 monoclonal antibody (B-B4) was purchased from Serotec (Oxford, UK).

This was evident by the morphology of C6 and Colo 320 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002319-g003">Fig. 3</xref>), paxillin staining of U87 glioma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002319-g002">Fig. 2</xref>) and Colo 320 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002319-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>), and phalloidin and vinculin staining of CHO and human skin fibroblasts plated on the 110 kDa fibronectin-like substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002319-g004">Fig. 4</xref>), indicating that syndecan clustering by the KKDC peptide is translated biochemically to cellular response. In contrast, heparanase appeared more efficient in stimulating the adhesion of floating ARH-77 leukemia cells compared with the KKDC peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002319-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). This result indicates that syndecan activation alone by the KKDC peptide may not be sufficient for efficient cell adhesion, and that cooperation with additional adhesion molecules such as integrins is required <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002319-Saoncella1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. Integrin activation was noted upon heparanase over expression or exogenous addition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002319-Zetser1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002319-Sotnikov1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. This activation does not seem to involve enzymatic aspects since mutated, inactive heparanase (DM) was as potent as wild type heparanase in facilitating ARH-77 F cell adhesion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002319-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). The molecular mechanism underlying integrin activation by heparanase awaits detailed characterization.</p><p>The prime syndecan candidate for mediating the effect of heparanase/KKDC on cell adhesion is syndecan-4 since this molecule is ubiquitously expressed and is the only syndecan that appears to reside at, and exhibit a functional role in the assembly of focal adhesions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002319-Couchman1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002319-Woods1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002319-Simons1">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref>. The KKDC peptide, however, clustered efficiently both syndecan-1 and syndecan-4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002319-g002">Fig. 2</xref>) and possibly additional syndecan family members, raising the possibility that enhanced cell adhesion and spreading is not solely mediated by syndecan-4. Indeed, essentially all syndecan family members are implicated in cell adhesion. For example, over expression of syndecan-1 in syndecan deficient Raji lymphoblastoid or COS-7 cells stimulated cell spreading <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002319-Beauvais1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. Similarly, syndecan-2 was noted to promote focal adhesion formation in Lewis-lung carcinoma cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002319-Couchman1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>, and syndecan-2 and syndecan-3 induce filopodia formation in COS-1, CHO-K1, Swiss 3T3, and dendritic cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002319-Beauvais1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002319-Tkachenko1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002319-Lin1">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref>. It is therefore likely that heparanase/KKDC induce the clustering of more than one syndecan family member and, possibly, also of glypicans, leading to enhanced cell adhesion and spreading. This possibility is further supported by the localization of syndecans following the addition of heparanase or the KKDC peptide. Clusters of syndecan-1 and syndecan-4 were similarly distributed on the cell surface following addition of the KKDC peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002319-g002">Fig. 2</xref>) in a pattern that does not coincide with focal complexes. Rapid internalization of heparanase-syndecan complexes following heparanase addition clearly implies that enhanced cell adhesion does not require localization of syndecans at focal adhesions, but rather involves syndecan activation.</p><p>Syndecan activation by soluble ligands such as heparanase may also have important clinical implications. Over expression of syndecan-1 has been observed in pancreatic, gastric and breast carcinomas, correlating with increased tumor aggressiveness and poor clinical prognosis, while syndecan-2 is often over expressed in colon carcinoma, and syndecan-4 is up-regulated in hepatocellular carcinoma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002319-Beauvais1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, coinciding with heparanase up-regulation in these carcinomas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002319-Ilan1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002319-Vlodavsky5">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. Syndecan-1 is particularly abundant in multiple myeloma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002319-Sanderson2">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref>, where an emerging role for heparanase has recently been shown <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002319-Yang1">&#x0005b;57&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002319-Yang3">&#x0005b;59&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, elevated levels of heparanase may activate syndecan family members and promote tumor metastasis and angiogenesis, resulting in poor prognosis often associated with patients exhibiting high levels of heparanase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002319-Ilan1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002319-Vlodavsky5">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Taken together, the results clearly highlight heparanase as a multi functional protein, exhibiting enzymatic activity-dependent and -independent functions. Better understanding of the basic biology of this protein will contribute to the development of efficient heparanase inhibitors directed, for example, against the heparin binding domains of heparanase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002319-LevyAdam1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002319-Zetser3">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>.

A. Heparin binding. KKDC peptide was synthesized in the absence (KKDC) or presence of ethandithiol (EDT), which binds covalently to the sulfate group of cysteine and prevents di-sulfide bridge formation between cysteine residues. Peptides (50 &#x000b5;M) were incubated (2 hours, 4&#x000b0;C) with heparin-Sepharose beads in PBS, washed with PBS supplemented with NaCl to a final concentration of 0.35 M, followed by one wash with PBS. Dye-free sample buffer was added and the beads were boiled for 5 minuntes, centrifuged and the supernatants were loaded on Tris-Tricine gel. Subsequently, gels were stained with Coomassie blue to visualize bound peptides (arrow). B. Heparanase enzymatic activity. B16 melanoma cells (2&#x000d7;106) were resuspended in RPMI medium and incubated (18 hours, 37&#x000b0;C) with 35S-labeled ECM in the absence (filled rectangle) or presence of control scrambled peptide dimer (green rectangle; 50 &#x000b5;M), KKDC peptide undergoing spontaneous dimerization (filled triangle; 50 &#x000b5;M), KKDC peptide following enhanced dimerization (blue rectangle; 50 &#x000b5;M), or heparin (filled circle; 15 &#x000b5;g/ml).
