Two of the polymerase beta cancer-associated variants are sequence-specific mutators, and one of them binds to DNA but has no polymerase activity. The Leu22Pro (L22P) DNA polymerase beta variant was identified in a gastric carcinoma. Leu22 resides within the 8 kDa amino terminal domain of DNA polymerase beta, which exhibits dRP lyase activity. This domain catalyzes the removal of deoxyribose phosphate during short patch base excision repair. We show that this cancer-associated variant has very little dRP lyase activity but retains its polymerase activity. Although residue 22 has no direct contact with the DNA, we report here that the L22P variant has reduced DNA-binding affinity. The L22P variant protein is deficient in base excision repair. Molecular dynamics calculations suggest that alteration of Leu22 to Pro changes the local packing, the loop connecting helices 1 and 2 and the overall juxtaposition of the helices within the N-terminal domain. This in turn affects the shape of the binding pocket that is required for efficient dRP lyase catalysis.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>In a mammalian cellular environment, DNA is under a continuous threat of spontaneous or chemical induced damage. Most of the time the damage is repaired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). One of the most important repair systems is base excision repair (BER). It is estimated that at least 20 000 lesions/cell/day are repaired by BER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>) suggesting that this system is important for maintaining genomic integrity. Aberrant BER is likely to be associated with human cancer.</p><p>The BER pathway is important for maintaining genomic integrity. BER removes oxidative and alkylation-induced DNA damage and restores the DNA to its original form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Short patch BER results in the repair synthesis of a 1&#x02013;6 nt gap whereas a gap &#x0003e;6 nt is filled in during long patch BER. Though polymerase beta (pol &#x003b2;) can participate in both pathways, its role is best characterized in short patch BER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). The very first step of short patch BER is damage recognition by a DNA glycosylase. The type of glycosylase that removes the base damage usually determines the subtype of BER pathway used by the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Once the base damage is recognized and removed by a monofunctional DNA glycosylase, the product of which is an AP site, the AP endonuclease, APE1, incises the backbone and usually leaves a 5&#x02032;-deoxyribose-phosphate (5&#x02032;dRP) moiety. Pol &#x003b2; then fills in the resulting gap and removes the 5&#x02032;dRP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). However, oxidative base damage is usually removed by a bifunctional DNA glycosylase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>), which results in 3&#x02032;-termini that cannot be ligated. When a 3&#x02032;-dRP group is present as would likely be the case following the action of the OGG1 DNA glycosylase, the 3'diesterase activity of APE 1 removes the dRP, leaving a 3&#x02032;OH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). However, BER appears to be independent of APE1 when the base damage is removed by the NEIL DNA glycosylase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). In this case, polynucleotide kinase (PNK) removes the 3&#x02032; phosphate that is a product of the NEIL glycoslyase. Pol &#x003b2; also fills in the gap after removal of oxidative damage, but it is not needed for dRP removal. After completion of gap filling by pol &#x003b2;, DNA ligase seals the nick.</p><p>The dRP lyase activity resides within the 8 kDa amino terminal domain of pol &#x003b2;, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>. The 8 kDa domain consists of antiparallel pairs of four helices, namely helix-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15 B16 B17 B18 B19 B20 B21 B22 B23 B24 B25 B26">15&#x02013;26</xref>), helix-2 (36&#x02013;47), helix-3 (56&#x02013;61) and helix-4 (69&#x02013;78). The NMR structure shows that the pairs of helices pack with a V-like shape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>) and the N-terminus of helix-1 and the C-terminus of helix-4 are near each other. The amino acid residues that are critical for dRP lyase activity include Lys72 (helix-4), Tyr39 (helix-2) and Lys35 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). It has been shown that the overall rate of BER is dependent upon the dRP lyase activity of pol &#x003b2; and not on polymerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). <fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>A ribbon representation of polymerase beta.

We have shown that three of these pol &#x003b2; tumor-associated variants induce cellular transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14 B15 B16">14&#x02013;16</xref>). The K289M colon and I260M prostate carcinoma variants are sequence-specific mutator polymerases that are likely to induce mutations within key growth control genes, leading to cellular transformation. The E295K gastric carcinoma-associated variant has no polymerase activity, which results in unfilled gaps that lead to genomic instability associated with cellular transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Here, we report on our studies of the Leu22Pro (L22P) gastric cancer-associated variant of pol &#x003b2;. We show that this variant has DNA polymerase activity but lacks dRP lyase activity. We also show that the L22P variant is unable to support BER <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title><p>Ultrapure deoxynucleoside triphosphates, ATP and [-&#x003b3;<sup>32</sup>P] ATP (&#x0003e;6000 Ci/mmol, 150 mCi/ml), [-&#x003b1;<sup>32</sup>P]ATP (&#x0003e;3000 Ci/mmol) were purchased from New England Biolabs, Sigma, and Amersham Biosciences, respectively.

After purification by a Bio&#x02013;Rad spin column to remove unincorporated dNTPs, annealing was performed by mixing phosphorylated template, radiolabeled primer and phosphorylated downstream oligos in 50 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl, pH 8.0, containing 0.25 M NaCl. The mixture was incubated sequentially at 95&#x000b0;C (5 min), slowly cooled to 50&#x000b0;C (for 30 min) and 50&#x000b0;C (for 20 min) and immediately transferred to ice. To verify proper hybridization, the product was analyzed on an 18% native polyacrylamide gel followed by autoradiography to assess the quality of annealing. For the preparation of 45AG1 bpDNP the non-phosphorylated downstream oligo was used during annealing.

The N-terminal domain was subjected to a periodic-boundary equilibration followed by a 10 ns molecular dynamics simulation. The calculations were performed using the Non-equilibrium Atomic Molecular Dynamics 2 (NAMD2) simulation package version 2.5. For the simulations the models were restricted to a domain comprising residues 1&#x02013;118. The Charmm27 force field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>) was used to model the intramolecular interactions within the N-terminal domain. The TIP3P model was used in the description of the water molecules. The N-terminal domains were placed in a sphere (non-periodic boundary) of water molecules with a 36 &#x000c5; radius exceeding the recommended NAMD2 default sphere radius by more than 10%. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Long-range non-bonding terms were calculated with a 12 &#x000c5; cutoff for electrostatic and van der Waals interactions. All hydrogen bond lengths were held constant with the SHAKE-RATTLE-ROLL algorithm. The simulations were carried out at a temperature of 310 K. The simulation temperature was maintained using a Langevin thermostat with a coupling constant of 5 ps&#x02212;1. The lengths of the simulations were determined by the proper convergence of the monitored properties (both molecules ran for a period of 20 ns simulations). The time step for all simulations was set to 2 fs. Trajectory analysis and molecular graphics images were generated using VMD. The time evolution of the radius of gyration (<italic>R</italic><sub>gyr</sub>), alpha-carbon alpha-carbon distances and hydrogen-bonding interactions were monitored during the simulation. Root mean-square deviation analyses (RMSD) were performed to evaluate systems mobility and proper convergence (data not shown). Ramachandran maps and scatter plot diagrams were generated to document changes in the overall structure of the N-terminal domain over time.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>L22P is a less active polymerase than wild-type pol &#x003b2;</title><p>To determine if L22P had polymerase activity, a primer extension assay was carried out with 5 bp gapped DNA substrate (CII5bp) to assess the polymerase activity of the L22P variant in comparison to WT.

Previous reports suggest that the dRP lyase reaction is catalyzed by &#x003b2;-elimination after Schiff's base formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). The Schiff's base complex is formed between Lys72 and the DNA. This complex is normally very transient but can be trapped using sodium borohydride as a reducing agent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). We carried out a trapping experiment to determine whether the L22P variant is capable of forming a Schiff's base. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A (lane 4), L22P forms a Schiff's base complex, the amount of which appears to be much less than WT. After Schiff's base formation, the reaction follows a &#x003b2;-elimination reaction followed by phosphate removal. Thus, the intensity of the trapped polymerase and DNA complex should diminish if borohydride is added after the reaction is over. For WT pol &#x003b2;, we observed this reduction of trapped product formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A, lanes 2 and 3), suggesting there is no dRP lyase substrate remaining at the end of the reaction.

This is also observed when the concentration of L22P is 5000 nM (L22P is &#x0003e;90% bound to DNA) and that of DNA is 100 nM (data not shown).

Our results suggest that this variant has lower affinity for DNA, significantly reduced dRP lyase activity, and that L22P cannot support BER. Molecular modeling studies support our biochemical data. Altogether, our results imply that an amino acid residue that is some 10.6 &#x000c5; from the active site cleft of the dRP lyase critically affects the catalysis of dRP removal.</p><sec><title>The L22P variant has a lowered DNA-binding affinity</title><p>The physiological substrate for pol &#x003b2; is likely single-nucleotide gapped DNA. In general, pol &#x003b2; has high affinity for DNA. This affinity is highest for 1 base gapped DNA, followed by 5&#x02013;6 base gapped and recessed DNA. The presence of downstream DNA is required for efficient and tight binding. The presence of phosphorylated versus non-phosphorylated downstream DNA does not increase the affinity for DNA but increases polymerase fidelity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>).</p><p>The N-terminal 8 kDa domain interacts with the downstream DNA whereas the thumb subdomain acts as a primer grip. NMR studies suggest that the DNA-binding site of the 8 kDa domain is located on the C-terminal part of the HhH motif. Residues important for DNA binding in the 8 kDa domain are Lys41, Lys60, His34, Arg40, Tyr39, Lys 68, Lys 72 and Arg83 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Although there is no structural detail available for Leu22 regarding DNA interactions, it is known that Leu is a helix-stabilizing amino acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). Thus, Leu22 most likely contributes to the overall stability of the neighboring HhH. Our results suggest that alteration of the helix stabilizing residue leucine to a helix breaker proline reduces the DNA-binding affinity by several fold (19&#x000d7;). Thus, if helix 1 becomes destabilized, the effect is probably propagated to the DNA-binding site.</p></sec><sec><title>BER and the dRP lyase activity of pol &#x003b2;</title><p>Pol &#x003b2; possesses DNA polymerase and dRP lyase activities, both of which are known to be important for BER. Previous reports showed that the dRP lyase deficient K72A pol &#x003b2; was unable to support BER in cell extracts prepared from pol &#x003b2;-deleted cells and that the 8 kDa domain alone was able to complement the MMS sensitivity of these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). The presence of the dRP group prevents DNA ligase from joining the phosphodiester backbone.</p><p>Our data demonstrate that L22P has no significant dRP lyase activity even under conditions where likely &#x0003e;95% of the DNA is bound by the protein. Under these conditions, we observed formation of the <italic>n</italic> + 1 band, confirming the ability of L22P to catalyze DNA synthesis, but there was very little ligated product formed (&#x0223c;5%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B, lanes 10 and 11). The L22P variant is able to interact with DNA ligase III and XRCC1 (data not shown), ruling out the possibility that a protein interaction deficiency is responsible for its inability to support BER. These results indicate that L22P is unable to support BER initiated by UDG, because it is not able to remove the dRP group. We have also shown that L22P is not able to support BER in cells treated with MMS, likely because it is not able to remove the dRP group. It has been shown by <italic>in vitro</italic> reconstituted BER assays that are initiated with UDG, that the overall rate-limiting step of BER is the dRP lyase reaction of pol &#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). However, this is not likely to be the case when oxidized bases are removed by either OGG1 or NEIL DNA glycosylase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Altered DNA binding and abolished dRP lyase activity are due to structural changes in the N-terminal domain</title><p>Leu22 is located in the N-terminal (8 kDa) domain of DNA polymerase beta and is not able to contact the DNA substrate directly. Previous studies have indicated that residues important for dRPase activity are Tyr39, Lys68 and Lys72 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). A study from Wilson <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>) showed that altering Lys72 to Ala abolishes dRP lyase activity without changing DNA binding. Matsumoto and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>) discovered that the dRP lyase reaction occurs via formation of Schiff's base followed by a beta elimination reaction. Further structural analyses revealed that Lys72 is the main catalytic residue responsible for Schiff's base formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>).</p><p>Leu22 is a hydrophobic residue located in the middle of the helix 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>C). Circular dichroism studies do not indicate that there are significant changes in the overall alpha helical content (data not shown) and thermal stability (melting temperature, <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub>) of L22P, suggesting the effect of Pro22 on the 8 kDa domain might affect the tertiary structure or perhaps the juxtaposition of pol &#x003b2; subdomains, changes not tractable by circular dichroism. The side-chain volume decreases typically by &#x0223c;30% when Leu22 is replaced by Pro in the variant structure. Consequently, the changes in packing density along with the observed increase in <italic>R</italic><sub>gyr</sub> in the L22P variant as compared to the fully equilibrated native structure could adversely affect duplex binding and catalytic activities of the L22P mutator.</p><p>Leu22 is some 10.6 &#x000c5; (C&#x003b1;-C) away from the catalytic Lys72 residue. Our biochemical and computational data suggest that it can affect overall catalysis for dRP lyase activity most probably by repositioning both helix 1 and an adjacent loop (residues 30&#x02013;34), which in turn affects the catalytic pocket of dRP. Several important residues (Glu26, Ser30, His34, Lys35, Tyr39, Lys68 and Lys72) form the lyase catalytic pocket (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). The first step of lyase reaction is correct positioning of the flexible sugar moiety followed by ring opening. His34 has been proposed to be involved in the base-stacking interaction with the downstream template base of gapped DNA. Protonation of Lys72 might induce ring opening. Feng <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>) have proposed that residue Lys35 or Lys68 could initiate the reaction by protonating the deoxyribose O-4&#x02032;, leading to opening of the ring. Lys72 is then deprotonated, ready for the nucleophilic attack. Mullen <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>) proposed from their structural data that the deprotonated form of Lys72 is stabilized by residue Tyr39. Following this stabilization, the beta elimination reaction takes place, which could be facilitated by Glu26. The last step of the lyase reaction is the removal of dRP from the Schiff's base complex. Lys35 is suggested to participate in the stabilization of the leaving phosphate group. The rigidity of the backbone around residues Lys72, Lys35 and Tyr39 allows a well-formed active site for dRP removal between DNA and protein. The bending and the inherent flexibility of helix 1 in the L22P variant causes local and global conformational changes in the structure of the N-terminal domain that may well cause a decrease in the binding affinity for gapped duplex DNA and a dramatic reduction in the actual catalytic turnover rate of the dRP lyase activity.</p><p>Our trapping experiments suggest that the L22P variant of pol &#x003b2; somehow retains the ability to form a Schiff's base (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A) but the rate of Schiff base formation is slower than WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B). It is most likely that residues Ser30 and His34 are not placed in the right position to aid Lys72 in completing the beta elimination reaction. Our results also suggest that the final step of phosphate removal is impaired in case of L22P since we did not observe rapid phosphate removal as with WT, indicating that Lys35 has most probably lost its rigidity that is required for correct active site geometry.</p></sec><sec><title>L22P and cancer</title><p>Our results showing that the L22P gastric cancer-associated variant lacks dRP lyase and DNA-binding activities are consistent with the possibility that this variant is linked to human cancer. Cells sustain at least 20 000 oxidative lesions per cell per day and it is likely that cancer treatment induces additional DNA damage. Some of the oxidative base damage could be removed by a monofunctional DNA glycosylase. If this were the case, it is likely that in the presence of L22P BER is initiated, the gap is filled in, but ligation does not occur if dRP group remains in the DNA. Upon encountering a replication fork, the unligated nick could be converted to a double-strand break. If repaired improperly, end joining could lead to translocations or deletions. If these alterations occur in key growth control genes, it could lead to tumorigenesis or metastasis. However, much of the oxidative base damage is likely to be removed by bifunctional DNA glycosylases. When this occurs, it is unlikely that the lack of dRP Lyase activity of L22P plays a role in increasing genomic instability. Rather, the weak affinity of L22P for DNA could lead to many unfilled gaps in cells, which could be converted to double-strand breaks and lead to genomic instability. Alternatively, the gap could be enlarged by nucleases and polymerases other than pol &#x003b2;, such as Y family polymerases with dRP lyase activity that could fill in the gap in an error prone manner, resulting in mutations and leading to cancer. Preliminary studies in our laboratory, showing that expression of L22P in mouse fibroblasts induces cellular transformation, (Dalal and Sweasy, unpublished data), support this idea. The presence of the dRP lyase-deficient L22P is likely to be important during treatment of the tumor by drugs including alkylating agents. These agents result in cytoxicity in the absence of DNA repair, but it is likely that many of the lesions are repaired by the BER pathway. It is likely that interference with BER leads to increased genomic instability.</p><p>Interestingly, we have shown that four of the other pol &#x003b2; cancer-associated variants, namely, K289M, I260M (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>), E295K (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>) and Y265C (Sweasy, unpublished data), induce cellular transformation when expressed in mouse fibroblasts. Each of these variants is likely to induce cellular transformation by causing genomic instability. The K289M and I260M colon- and prostate cancer-associated variants are sequence-specific mutator polymerases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). The gastric cancer-associated E295K variant is polymerase deficient and acts in a dominant negative manner to interfere with BER. This variant also induces sister chromatid exchanges in mouse cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Our combined studies of these mutants support the mutator phenotype hypothesis of human cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>) and suggest that BER is a tumor suppressor mechanism.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We thank Nilesh Banavali for suggestions and helpful discussions on the evaluation of the molecular dynamics simulations.
