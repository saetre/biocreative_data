This microenvironment is located in the bone marrow (BM) where hematopoietic and bone remodeling cells, osteoblasts and osteoclasts, are anatomically juxtaposed. Due to the close proximity of these cells, it is reasonable to hypothesize that these hematopoietic and bone cells communicate with and/or regulate one another. However, the complex microenvironmental interactions and the molecular pathways that govern these connections occurring at this bone-bone marrow interface are still not well understood.</p><p>At the bone surface, the dynamic process of bone remodeling involves the constant interaction between bone-forming osteoblasts and bone-resorbing osteoclasts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007955-Matsuo1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007955-Teitelbaum1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. While the roles of osteoblasts and osteoclasts in bone remodeling have been well established, recent studies have demonstrated that these cells are also crucial components of the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) niche. Accumulating evidence suggests that osteoblasts enforce the quiescence of HSCs, while osteoclasts induce hematopoietic activity. In particular, osteoblasts have been shown to physically anchor HSCs to the endosteal surface of the trabecular regions of the bone, thereby keeping them in an undifferentiated and quiescent state <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007955-Zhang1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007955-Arai1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. Conversely, osteoclasts secrete bone-resorbing enzymes, such as cathepsin K (CTSK), which promote mobilization of HSCs from their quiescent state. This process involves the cleavage of cytokines, such as stem cell factor (SCF), that are responsible for HSC anchorage to the niche <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007955-Kollet1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007955-Heissig1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, the balance between osteoblastic and osteoclastic activity not only dictates healthy bone volume but also contributes to maintaining hematopoietic homeostasis.</p><p>Although a great deal of progress has been made in defining the BM microenvironment, the molecular regulators involved, their interactions, and how they affect bone remodeling, hematopoiesis, and cell fate decisions are largely unknown. Here, we report a new role for the inhibitor of differentiation (<italic>Id1</italic>) gene in bone remodeling and maintenance of the BM microenvironment. Id1 is one of four proteins in a family of transcriptional regulators that all function by inhibiting basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors from binding DNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007955-Benezra1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007955-Ruzinova1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Id proteins have a helix-loop-helix domain that allows them to dimerize with bHLH transcription factors, but lack a DNA-binding domain. As a result, Id-bHLH transcription factor heterodimers cannot bind to DNA, leading to the disruption of the events mediating the cellular differentiation and proliferation of a variety of different cell types.</p><p>In this study, we report several lines of evidence that Id1 is a critical regulator of bone and BM homeostasis. In particular, <italic>Id1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice exhibited an osteoporotic phenotype, with significantly reduced bone mineral content and density. This is a novel finding, as Id1 has not been previously linked to osteoporosis. We also show that the expression of genes necessary for osteoclast maturation, such as <italic>CTSK</italic>, <italic>TRAP</italic>, and <italic>Oscar</italic> are upregulated in osteoclasts derived from <italic>Id1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice and repressed in osteoclasts overexpressing <italic>Id1</italic>, suggesting that Id1 is a master regulator of a set of genes required for osteoclast function and bone resorption. Examination of the hematopoietic compartment of <italic>Id1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice revealed an increase in myeloid differentiation and HSPC proliferation. Thus, in the absence of Id1, the HSPC pool is likely depleted by the increased flux towards myeloid differentiation, resulting in osteoclast-driven changes to the BM microenvironment. Results from this study will shed light on the molecular cues at the bone-bone marrow interface that regulate both bone and BM homeostasis. Moreover, Id1 may potentially be a novel therapeutic target for the treatment of skeletal disorders.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title><italic>Id1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> Mice Exhibit an Osteoporotic Phenotype</title><p>To assess the effect of loss of Id1 on skeletal structure and function, we analyzed the bones of <italic>Id1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice. <italic>Id1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice were born at the expected mendelian frequency and showed no obvious abnormalities.

Three-dimensional microstructural analysis using micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) confirmed that loss of Id1 resulted in a significant reduction in bone mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007955-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Furthermore, this analysis revealed significant decreases in bone volume fraction, bone mineral content, bone mineral density (BMD), trabecular thickness, and marrow area (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0007955-t001">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007955.s001">Figure S1B</xref>).

Second, the osteoporotic phenotype was associated with a reduction in the number of reserve HSPCs and an increased tendency toward myeloid differentiation. Id1 impact on myeloid and osteoclast cell numbers and their shared microenvironment can help explain the functional significance of the drive toward the myeloid compartment, as seen in our results, as well as others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007955-Jankovic1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007955-Perry1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, the <italic>Id1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mouse represents a model that simulates the bone and BM features seen in an aged host. Disruption of normal osteoclast function via the loss of Id1 had profound effects on the behavior and activity of cells in the BM microenvironment. These observations demonstrate that bone cells provide critical regulatory cues to the hematopoietic system, confirming that cross-talk between these different cell types at the bone-bone marrow interface does indeed occur.</p><p>The BM microenvironment is a specialized region of the bone responsible for a host of homeostatic functions, including maintenance of stem cell number, protecting stem and progenitor cells from exhaustion over the lifetime of an organism, and providing cues that dictate the self-renewal or differentiation of HSPCs to other cell types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007955-Wilson1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007955-Yin1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. Within this niche, the endosteum lines the inner surface of the bone and serves as the interface between the bone and BM. Even though traditionally, bone and BM functions have been regarded as distinct, unrelated processes, it is becoming increasingly clear that the bone remodeling cells, osteoblasts and osteoclasts, are crucial components of the BM microenvironment. Osteoblasts and osteoclasts interact with each other through cytokines secreted by either cell type, as well as by membrane-bound ligands and receptors to initiate intracellular signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007955-Matsuo1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007955-Boyle1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Osteoblasts and BM stromal cells secrete two cytokines, macrophage colony stimulating factor (M-CSF) and RANKL, which are both necessary and sufficient to induce osteoclast differentiation. M-CSF induces the expression of RANK in osteoclast precursor cells, priming them to differentiate in response to RANKL <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007955-Boyle1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, osteoclasts stimulated with M-CSF undergo cytoskeletal reorganization, cell spreading and migration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007955-Palacio1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007955-Bruzzaniti1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>.

Therefore, intrinsic and extrinsic regulatory pathways converge to maintain bone and BM homeostasis.</p><p>Despite recent studies that have recognized the importance of osteoblasts in regulating hematopoiesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007955-Zhang1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007955-Calvi1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007955-Visnjic1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>, we did not find any differences in osteoblast number or function between <italic>Id1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice and wild-type controls. However, the present study does show the importance of Id1 during osteoclast differentiation. Osteoclast numbers were increased in the bones of <italic>Id1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice and differentiation of BM monocytes to osteoclasts was increased by Id1 deficiency, suggesting a cell-autonomous role for Id1 in osteoclastogenesis. In addition, the absence of Id1 resulted in increased expression of <italic>CTSK</italic>, <italic>TRAP</italic>, <italic>Oscar</italic>, and <italic>NFATc1</italic>, while overexpression of <italic>Id1</italic> decreased expression of these genes. Therefore, interaction between Id1 and Mitf may normally act to inhibit a cascade of gene expression events required for osteoclast differentiation.</p><p>As a consequence of the increased osteoclast differentiation and activity, we observed increased secretion of extrinsic factors, such as CTSK, into the BM microenvironment. In keeping with a previous report showing the potential of CTSK to cleave stem cell regulating cytokine SCF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007955-Kollet1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, we found increased plasma levels of SCF in <italic>Id1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice. We propose that this alteration in the level of secreted factors in the microenvironment directly contributed to the increased tendency of <italic>Id1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> LSK cells to enter the cell cycle, leading to increased turnover and premature exhaustion of HSPCs. <italic>Id1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice reconstituted with BM overexpressing <italic>Id1</italic> were able to reestablish the levels of HSPCs and myeloid cells comparable to those observed in wild-type mice. Furthermore, knockdown of CTSK in the BM of <italic>Id1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice decreased osteoclast function and enhanced trabecular bone formation. Finally, our finding that transplantation of wild-type BM into <italic>Id1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice only partially restored the bone and hematopoietic phenotype in these animals provides more evidence that the intrinsic program of cells in the microenvironment integrate with multiple extrinsic molecules and pathways needed to regulate bone and BM homeostasis. Although the present data are highly suggestive that Id1 can play a regulatory role in both intrinsic and extrinsic cues necessary for maintaining a balanced microenvironment, the challenge for future investigations will be to sort out cell intrinsic versus cell extrinsic activities <italic>in vivo</italic>. Undoubtedly this will be a difficult task, as they are most certainly interconnected, but by doing so it will elucidate the precise molecular mechanisms responsible for the role of Id1 in the bone and BM.</p><p>Finally, it has been shown that Id proteins often have overlapping functions and can compensate for each other. Specifically, <italic>Id1</italic> and <italic>Id3</italic> were shown to have very similar expression patterns and targeting of both genes is often required to produce a phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007955-Yokota1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. Previously, we reported that tumor growth was inhibited more effectively in <italic>Id1<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup></italic>, <italic>Id3<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> than in <italic>Id1<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup></italic>, <italic>Id3<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup></italic> mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007955-Lyden1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. Similarly, other studies have shown that simultaneous targeting of <italic>Id1</italic> and <italic>Id3</italic>, compared to targeting of each gene alone, is more effective at inhibiting tumor growth and metastatic potential of breast, colorectal, gastric, and pancreatic cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007955-Gupta1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007955-Tsuchiya1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. In the current study, the absence of <italic>Id1</italic> alone produced a significant bone and hematopoietic phenotype, suggesting that <italic>Id3</italic> does not compensate for <italic>Id1</italic> in this instance. However, we found that <italic>Id3</italic> expression is slightly elevated in the BM of <italic>Id1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice compared to wild-type littermates (data not shown). The significance of this finding is so far unclear, but it will be of interest to observe if <italic>Id1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic>, <italic>Id3<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice have a more severe bone and hematopoietic phenotype compared to <italic>Id1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic>, <italic>Id3<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup></italic> mice. Clearly, more work will be necessary to elucidate the precise role of <italic>Id3</italic> in the bone and hematopoietic phenotypes described here.</p><p>It is clear that our understanding of the fundamental mechanisms underlying the connections between the bone and BM is still in its infancy. In the future, many fruitful discoveries may come from investigating the commonalities between these two systems. This study offers insight into the cellular and molecular interactions of Id1 in regulation of bone and BM physiology. Although the clinical relevance of our findings has yet to be determined, the knowledge acquired from our results has the possibility of translating into potential therapeutic treatments in the areas of osteoporotic and malignant diseases. Moreover, microenvironments have garnered increased attention in recent years, due to findings that highlight the importance of BM cells, stem cells, and niches in areas of diseases such as cancer. We previously showed the role of Id proteins in supporting the growth of primary tumors and metastatic lesions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007955-Lyden1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007955-Lyden2">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. We also demonstrated the importance of niches in metastatic spread of tumor cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007955-Kaplan1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. From the results of the present study, it is intriguing to speculate that long-standing osteoporosis may result in a reduced HSC pool, thus impairing the mobilization of HSCs to future peripheral sites of metastasis. It would also be of interest to investigate whether cooperation between osteoclasts and HSPCs can create a favorable environment for tumor cells to engraft and proliferate in the bones. A better understanding of the function of Id genes in osteoclasts, hematopoietic cells, tumorigenesis, and metastasis is clearly necessary in order to intelligently design tailored therapies. As the molecular and cellular events that regulate the function of the BM microenvironment are unraveled, novel methods for its specific manipulation for tailored therapies should also be revealed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Mice</title><p>Generation of <italic>Id1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice has been previously reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007955-Yan1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>.

The following viral cis-acting sequences are labeled: long terminal regions (LTR); major splice donor sites (SD), encapsidation signal (&#x003c8;) including the 5&#x02032; portion of the gag gene (GA); Rev-response element (RRE); splice acceptor sites (SA); and post-transcriptional regulatory element of woodchuck hepatitis virus (Wpre). (B) Expression of Id1 in the BM of transplanted mice (&#x0002a;&#x0002a;&#x0002a;P&#x0003c;0.001; n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;6).
