The enzymes O-GlcNAc Transferase (Ogt) and O-GlcNAcase (Oga) catalyze, respectively, the attachment and removal of O-GlcNAc to target proteins. In adult mice, Ogt and Oga attenuate the response to insulin by modifying several components of the signal transduction pathway.

The embryos had 23% fewer cells than controls, and displayed increased rates of cell death as early as the mid-gastrula stages. An extensive marker analysis indicates that derivatives of three germ layers are reduced to variable extents, and the embryos are severely disorganized after gastrulation. Overexpression of Ogt and Oga delayed epiboly and caused a severe disorganization of the microtubule and actin based cytoskeleton in the extra-embryonic yolk syncytial layer (YSL). The cytoskeletal defects resemble those previously reported for embryos lacking function of the Pou5f1/Oct4 transcription factor <italic>spiel ohne grenzen</italic>.

This is accomplished by regulation at the transcriptional, translational and post-translational levels. While the effects of post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation, proteolytic cleavage and N-linked glycosylation have been well studied, relatively little is known about how the O-linked addition of the simple monosaccharide &#x003b2;-<italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) affects protein activities during development. This sugar is attached to a wide variety of nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins, including those implicated in controlling important steps during development such as NeuroD1, &#x003b2;-catenin, c-myc and the cytoplasmic tails of plakoglobin and E-cadherin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Other proteins modified by O-GlcNAc include casein kinase II (CKII), nuclear pore proteins, RNA polymerase II and numerous transcription factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. These observations implicate O-GlcNAc in the regulation of transcription, protein stability and cell cycle progression, among other events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Attachment of O-GlcNAc is rapidly induced in response to external stimuli such as nutrient status and stress, and is reversible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Thus, unlike complex glycosylation, O-GlcNAc modification is highly dynamic and transiently alters protein function in a manner analogous to phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>O-GlcNAc is covalently linked to serine and threonine residues of target proteins by the enzyme O-GlcNAc Transferase (Ogt), which uses the product of the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway, UDP-GlcNAc, as a high-energy substrate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The reverse reaction is catalyzed by O-GlcNAcase (Oga), a cytosolic and nuclear N-acetylglucosaminidase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Both Ogt and Oga are modified by O-GlcNAc. The residues of many proteins modified by O-GlcNAc are also targets of ser/thr kinases, suggesting that Ogt modulates signal transduction pathways by preventing phosphorylation kinase targets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. This model of regulatory control by O-GlcNAc modification is supported by studies of the roles of Ogt and Oga in the insulin pathway. Insulin shuts down glucose production in hepatocytes by promoting the phosphorylation of the CRTC2 transcription factor, which is then targeted for ubiquitin-dependent degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. By O-GlcNAcylating CRTC2, Ogt prevents its phosphorylation and protects it from degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. CRTC2 then antagonizes the effects of insulin by inducing expression of gluconeogenic genes such as glucose-6-phosphatase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Ogt also antagonizes the response to insulin in adipocytes by modifying and inactivating a number of components of the insulin signal transduction cascade, including IRSs and PI3K [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. When overexpressed in adult mice, Ogt induces insulin resistance whereas Oga suppresses the development of type II diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].</p><p>In humans, a single <italic>ogt </italic>gene produces three enzymatic isoforms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Two isoforms are localized to the nuclei and cytoplasm, while one isoform appears to be localized exclusively to the mitochondria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Ogt contains two conserved catalytic domains in the C-terminus, called CDI and CDII, and an N-terminal tetratricopeptide repeat domain (TPR) that differs in the three isoforms and mediates protein-protein interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Although the monomer can catalyze the addition of O-GlcNAc in <italic>in vitro </italic>assays, multimeric Ogt has a greater affinity for UDP-GlcNAc [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. This suggests that Ogt forms an active multimeric complex <italic>in vivo</italic>. In support of this idea, the TPR domain is essential for enzyme activity in <italic>Xenopus </italic>oocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. The recent solving of a bacterial Ogt homolog has shed light on the activity and specificity of the enzyme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].</p><p>The role of O-GlcNAc modification in regulating embryonic development has been more difficult to establish. In mice, <italic>ogt </italic>is expressed in embryonic stem cells and in all adult tissues examined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. The complete absence of <italic>ogt </italic>function is lethal to mouse embryonic stem cells and embryos, but the phenotype has not been well characterized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Experiments with conditional alleles revealed that <italic>ogt </italic>is required in a tissue specific manner at later stages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Differentiated neurons survive in the absence of <italic>ogt </italic>function, but the brains are reduced and animals survive less than 10 days. By contrast, embryonic fibroblasts do not proliferate in the absence of <italic>ogt </italic>function, and mutant T-cells undergo apoptosis. In <italic>Xenopus </italic>oocytes, O-GlcNAc levels fluctuate during oogenesis and remain elevated after fertilization until the onset of gastrulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Ogt activity is required for oocyte maturation and blocking its activity prevents entry into M-phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. These results show that <italic>ogt </italic>is required for cell proliferation at early stages, but has stage and tissue dependent functions at later stages. We were interested in determining the function of <italic>ogt </italic>during the blastula and gastrula stages, when the body axes are established and the germ layers form.</p><p><italic>ogt </italic>is highly conserved throughout evolution, and orthologues are found in at least three eukaryotic kingdoms, including animalia, plantae, and fungi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Genetic studies in the plant <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana </italic>show that it is possible to identify new roles for <italic>ogt </italic>by analyzing hypomorphic mutant conditions. There are two genes in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, called <italic>spindly </italic>(<italic>spy</italic>) and <italic>secret agent </italic>(<italic>sec</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. <italic>spy; sec </italic>double mutant seeds fail to germinate, indicating that the two genes have overlapping requirements in early development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Thus, the requirement of <italic>ogt </italic>for proliferation in early embryos has been strongly conserved in plants and animals. In <italic>spy </italic>single mutants, SEC provides sufficient Ogt activity to bypass the early requirement, revealing a later requirement. <italic>spy </italic>mutant plants display an aberrant response to the plant growth hormone, gibberellin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Therefore in plants, Ogt acts at later stages of development to regulate specific signalling pathways, analogous its role modulating the response to insulin in mammals.</p><p>To determine if O-GlcNAc modification modulates signalling pathways that control vertebrate development, we used the zebrafish model organism. There are two <italic>ogt </italic>orthologues in zebrafish, present in tandem copies on chromosome 14, separated by approximately 200 kb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. The two genes are highly similar at the nucleic acid level, and are expressed maternally and zygotically. The genes have two alternatively spliced exons in zebrafish <italic>ogt</italic>, producing six different enzyme isoforms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. We show that both full-length and short Ogt isoforms are active <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo</italic>, in contrast to previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. To determine the role of O-GlcNAc modifications in development, we increased or decreased O-GlcNAc levels in embryos by overexpressing zebrafish Ogt, human Oga, or morpholinos against <italic>ogt </italic>transcripts. Each treatment results in smaller embryos with increased rates of cell death. In addition, Ogt and Oga overexpressing embryos have morphogenesis defects, probably resulting from underlying defects in the actin and microtubule based cytoskeleton in the yolk. Finally, we show that the pou class transcription factor Oct4/Pou5f1 is modified by O-GlcNAc in human embryonic stem cells. This suggests that O-GlcNAc regulates the activity of Pou5f1 in embryonic stem cells and, possibly, in whole embryos. We conclude that O-GlcNAc modifications play a critical role during embryogenesis in regulating morphogenesis and cell survival.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Two <italic>ogt </italic>genes arose from a zebrafish specific gene duplication</title><p>Unlike other animals, zebrafish have two <italic>ogt </italic>genes, called copy I and copy II, which are 67% identical at the nucleotide level and 89% identical at the amino acid level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. To conform to the standard zebrafish nomenclature, we rename these genes <italic>ogta </italic>and <italic>ogtb</italic>, respectively (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Alternative splicing of <italic>ogta </italic>produces four transcripts (variants 1&#x02013;4), while alternative splicing of <italic>ogtb </italic>produces two transcripts (variants 5 and 6) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. The plant <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana </italic>is the only other model organism with two <italic>ogt </italic>genes, <italic>spindly </italic>(<italic>spy</italic>) and <italic>secret agent </italic>(<italic>sec</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. We performed a phylogenetic analysis to determine when the duplication event occurred. <italic>Danio rerio ogta </italic>is 37% identical to <italic>sec </italic>at the amino acid level and only 21% identical to <italic>spy</italic>. Similarly, <italic>Danio rerio ogtb </italic>is 39% identical to <italic>sec</italic>, and only 22% identical to <italic>spy</italic>. Thus, both zebrafish genes are more closely related to one another and to <italic>sec </italic>than to <italic>spy</italic>. This indicates that <italic>Danio rerio ogta </italic>and <italic>ogtb </italic>originated after the plant and animal kingdoms diverged (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). To pinpoint more precisely when the <italic>ogt </italic>duplication event occurred, we examined the <italic>ogt </italic>genes in the sequenced genomes of other metazoan animals, including worms, sea squirts, mice and humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. Each of these species has a single <italic>ogt </italic>gene, raising the possibility that the zebrafish <italic>ogt </italic>gene duplication occurred during the teleost specific whole genome duplication event (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. To test this, we examined the sequenced genomes of other teleost fish for <italic>ogt </italic>orthologues. The green spotted pufferfish (<italic>Tetraodon nigroviridis</italic>), fugu pufferfish (<italic>Takifugu rubripes</italic>), stickleback (<italic>Gasterosteaus aculeatus</italic>) and medaka (<italic>Oryzias latipes</italic>) each have only a single <italic>ogt </italic>orthologue (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. We conclude that the <italic>D. rerio ogta </italic>and <italic>ogtb </italic>arose from a very recent, zebrafish specific gene duplication.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>The origin and expression pattern of zebrafish <italic>ogt </italic>genes</bold>.

(B) Phylogenetic analysis of <italic>ogt </italic>genes constructed using the neighbor-joining method using aligned amino acid sequences (see materials and methods for gene identifier numbers for each of the sequences used).

Sequence analysis revealed that this transcript encodes the variant 2 Ogt isoform, which lacks exon 2a and contains exon 19 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, red boxes) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Since previous experiments showed that bacterially expressed variant 2 Ogt lacked enzymatic activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>], we removed exon 19 from this construct in order to generate an enzyme with the same sequence as the variant 4 isoform (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title><italic>ogt </italic>expression is gradually restricted to the brain</title><p>A previous study included an extensive RT-PCR analysis of expression of all Ogt variants over a developmental time course [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. We examined the spatial distribution of <italic>ogt </italic>transcripts by <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization in a developmental time-course (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C&#x02013;J</xref>). Our probe was complementary to the entire variant 2 sequence and is expected to hybridize to all transcripts from the <italic>ogta </italic>and <italic>ogtb </italic>genes due to the high homology at the nucleotide level between the two genes. <italic>ogt </italic>transcripts are found in all cells of cleavage stage embryos, consistent with earlier reports of maternal expression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. This staining was specific, since no signal was detected with a sense probe (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). High levels of <italic>ogt </italic>transcripts persist in all cells through the blastula stages (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E, F</xref>), but decline during gastrulation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1G</xref>). At 24 hpf, the staining is more intense in neural tissues, especially the brain, than in mesodermal tissues like the notochord (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1H</xref>, arrow). From 36 hpf to 72 hpf, <italic>ogt </italic>transcripts are localized exclusively in the brain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1I, J</xref>). This demonstrates that <italic>ogt </italic>has a more dynamic expression pattern than previously suspected, consistent with the idea that it has different functions at different stages of embryonic development.</p></sec><sec><title>O-GlcNAc modifications regulate embryonic development</title><p>Next, we took a loss-of-function approach to determine the function of <italic>ogt </italic>during embryonic development. We designed two translation-blocking morpholino oligonucleotides (MOs) against <italic>ogt </italic>transcripts. MO1 was designed to target all transcript variants of <italic>ogta</italic>, and MO2 was designed to target all transcript variants of <italic>ogtb</italic>. Translation blocking MOs inhibit the synthesis of protein from zygotic and maternal transcripts, but do not affect Ogt protein synthesized before the MO is injected. We reasoned that the early expressed protein might provide sufficient Ogt activity to bypass any requirement during the cleavage stages, permitting us to examine the role of Ogt at later stages of development. At 24 hpf, embryos injected with 7.5 ng of a control MO developed normally, and the eyes, midbrain-hindbrain boundary, notochord and somites are clearly visible (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>; N = 40). By contrast, more than a third of embryos injected with 7.5 ng MO1 (34%) or MO2 (37%) were smaller than controls, with shortened body axes, reduced heads, small or absent eyes, and twisted notochords (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B, C</xref>; N = 32, N = 35, respectively). Some embryos showed signs of necrosis in the head (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>, arrow), which became more pronounced and more frequent with age (data not shown). When MO injected embryos are subsequently injected with <italic>ogt </italic>variant 4 mRNA, the fraction of wild type embryos increases from less than 10% to more than 50% (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). This rescue rules out potential off-target effects of the MOs.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Tissues from all three germ layers are reduced in <italic>ogt </italic>morphants</bold>.

Embryos expressing <italic>ogt-gfp </italic>mRNA produce high levels of the fusion protein, as indicated by GFP fluorescence. Control MOs have no effect on fluorescence levels in these embryos (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref>; N = 30). In the presence of MO1, however, fluorescence levels decreased below the level of background yolk autofluorescence (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2F</xref>; N = 30). This suggests that the MO efficiently blocks translation of <italic>ogt </italic>transcripts and reduces the level of endogenous Ogt protein. To determine if the MOs reduced global O-GlcNAc levels, we performed Western blots on protein extracts from 18 hpf embryos using an O-GlcNAc specific antibody (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2V</xref>). For this analysis, we made protein extracts from embryos injected with MO1 or MO2 that displayed aberrant morphology and from embryos injected with a control MO that had normal morphology. We used the RL2 monoclonal antibody to recognize O-GlcNAc modified proteins (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2V</xref>). Quantification of all the bands revealed that total O-GlcNAc levels are reduced by 35% in embryos injected with MO1 as compared with controls, and by 20% in embryos injected with MO2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2V, W</xref>). This is consistent with a reduction in endogenous Ogt protein levels in MO injected embryos.</p><p>To determine if the defects in <italic>ogt </italic>morphants are due to reductions in O-GlcNAc levels, we expressed 250 pg mRNA encoding the human orthologue of <italic>oga </italic>(hOga; gi: 10835355). We found that hOga expressing embryos have a shortened body axis, reduced heads, small or absent eyes and twisted notochords (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>). These defects strongly resemble those in <italic>ogt </italic>morphants, confirming that reducing O-GlcNAc levels has severe consequences on embryonic development.

A table of the probes used and the tissues they mark is presented in the Methods (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). We first examined expression of genes that mark derivatives of the neurectoderm, mesoderm or endoderm. <italic>emx1 </italic>marks the dorsal telencephalon in embryos injected with the control MO (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2G</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. The <italic>emx1 </italic>expression domain is slightly reduced in embryos injected with MO1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2H</xref>; N = 20) or MO2 (data not shown; N = 25). Another structure in the dorsal telencephalon, called the epiphysis, expresses the <italic>floating head </italic>(<italic>flh</italic>) transcription factor (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2J</xref>, arrowhead) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. Even in cases of dramatically reduced brains, <italic>flh </italic>is expressed normally in the forebrains of <italic>ogt </italic>morphants, or is expanded slightly (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2K</xref>, N = 30; MO2 data not shown, N = 30). The consistent expression of <italic>emx1 </italic>and <italic>flh </italic>indicates that the dorsal telencephalon forms and is normally patterned in <italic>ogt </italic>morphants. In the segmented hindbrain, rhombomeres 3 and 5 express the zinc finger transcription factor <italic>krox20 </italic>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2M</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. In Ogt-depleted embryos, <italic>krox20 </italic>is still expressed in two stripes, although expression in rhombomere 3 is often reduced (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2N</xref>, N = 30; MO2 data not shown, N = 27). In embryos overexpressing hOga, <italic>emx1 </italic>is expressed in the dorsal telencephalon, as in <italic>ogt </italic>morphants (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2I</xref>; 4/6), and <italic>flh </italic>is expressed in the epiphysis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2L</xref>; 5/7). In addition, <italic>krox20 </italic>transcripts are detected in rhombomeres 3 and 5, although rhombomere 3 is often reduced (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2O</xref>; 7/10). Thus, the anterior-posterior patterning of the brain is normal when O-GlcNAc levels are decreased, but the amount of tissue is slightly reduced in the forebrain and hindbrain.</p><p>Derivatives of the mesoderm and endoderm are reduced and disorganized when <italic>ogt </italic>function is reduced. Within the mesoderm, slow muscle forms in the somites on either side of the midline, and expresses &#x003b1;-<italic>tropomyosin </italic>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2P</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. In the morphants, &#x003b1;-<italic>tropomyosin </italic>expression reveals the presence of slow muscle tissue in a reduced number of highly disorganized somites (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2Q</xref>, 12/19; MO2 data not shown 9/15). Endoderm precursors are apparent during gastrulation, as individual <italic>sox17 </italic>expressing cells migrate toward the animal pole (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2S</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. In addition, <italic>sox17 </italic>is expressed in a small group of dorsal forerunner cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2S</xref>, arrowhead), which are not of endodermal origin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. Endodermal expression of <italic>sox17 </italic>is significantly reduced in the morphants, indicating that the embryos have fewer endoderm precursors than embryos injected with control MOs (compare Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2S</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2T</xref>). The morphants also have fewer dorsal forerunner cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2T</xref>). Embryos expressing hOga strongly resemble the morphants, and have fewer somites than controls (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2R</xref>; 5/7). In addition, hOga expressing embryos have significantly fewer endoderm precursors (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2U</xref>; 17/25) and dorsal forerunner cells than controls (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2U</xref>, arrowhead). The reduction of ectodermal, mesodermal and endodermal tissues in <italic>ogt </italic>morphants and hOga expressing embryos suggests that O-GlcNAc modifications regulate cell proliferation, survival, or cell fate determination.</p></sec><sec><title>Induction of mesoderm and endoderm are normal in <italic>ogt </italic>morphants</title><p>The dramatic reduction in endoderm and the more subtle reduction in mesoderm and ectodermal derivatives could be explained by a failure to properly specify the germ layers before gastrulation.

In controls, the <italic>brachyury </italic>homologue <italic>no-tail </italic>(<italic>ntl</italic>) is expressed in a marginal ring that includes all mesoderm and endoderm precursors at 5 hpf, as in wild type (N = 15) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. This expression is not altered by injection of MO1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>, N = 25) or MO2 (data not shown). Within the dorsal mesoderm, <italic>flh </italic>is expressed in the presumptive notochord, while <italic>goosecoid </italic>is expressed in the prechordal plate (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>]. Both <italic>flh </italic>(data not shown) and <italic>gsc </italic>(4D, N = 25) are expressed normally in the morphants. Finally, the <italic>mezzo </italic>transcription factor acts downstream of Nodal signals to specify endoderm, and is expressed in a ring at the margin (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4G</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>]. <italic>Mezzo </italic>expression in <italic>ogt </italic>morphants (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4F</xref>, N = 30) is indistinguishable from those injected with control MOs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E</xref>). Thus, the expression of early markers for mesoderm and endoderm appears normal when O-GlcNAc levels are reduced in <italic>ogt </italic>morphants. Therefore, we could find no evidence that O-GlcNAc modifications control the initial specification of the germ layers or establishment of the body axes. Instead, we conclude that morphological defects in <italic>ogt </italic>morphants observed at later stages are caused by the failure of precursor cells to survive or proliferate, or by aberrant morphogenesis.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Induction of mesoderm and endoderm are normal in <italic>ogt </italic>morphants</bold>.

The epiphysis is greatly reduced or missing in Class II embryos (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6P</xref>, arrowhead), indicating that the size of the epiphysis varies widely in Ogta expressing embryos. In the brain, the transcription factor <italic>pax2.1 </italic>is expressed at the mid-brain/hind-brain (MHB) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>, arrowhead) boundary and in the more posterior otic vesicles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>]. In class I embryos, <italic>pax2.1 </italic>expression in the MHB boundary is not perturbed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6J</xref>, arrowhead; 10/20), but the otic vesicles are often abnormally positioned. In class II embryos, <italic>flh </italic>expression at the MHB boundary is severely disrupted (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6Q</xref>, arrowhead; 5/20). In the hindbrain, <italic>krox20 </italic>stripes are normal, or slightly narrower in class I embryos (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6K</xref>; N = 25) as compared to controls (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref>). In class II embryos, the hindbrains are highly disorganized, and often display only a single stripe of <italic>krox20 </italic>expression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6R</xref>). Thus tissues in the forebrain, mid-brain, and hindbrain are present, but are reduced and disorganized to varying extents in Ogt overexpressing embryos. Expression of the slow muscle marker, &#x003b1;-<italic>tropomyosin </italic>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6E</xref>), is expressed in a reduced number of highly disorganized somites in Class I (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6L</xref>; 14/20) and Class II (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6S</xref>) embryos.

To better understand when the embryos become disorganized, we examined markers of axial and paraxial mesoderm just after gastrulation, and during the segmentation stages. In control embryos after gastrulation, the cells of the axial mesoderm express <italic>ntl </italic>and extend along the midline (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A</xref>). In Ogt expressing embryos, by contrast, <italic>ntl </italic>expression is truncated along the midline, resulting in a shortened body axis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8B</xref>). In class II embryos, <italic>ntl </italic>expression is completely restricted to the margin (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8C</xref>). <italic>MyoD </italic>is expressed early in the segmented mesoderm that gives rise to the somites (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8D</xref>).

In addition, the somites in class I embryos are often wider than those in controls (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8E</xref>). In class II embryos, the somites are extremely broad and nearly encircle the embryo (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8F</xref>).

As reported above (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>), a large fraction of Ogt overexpressing cells die before 24 hpf, and many embryos examined before this stage had signs of defective morphogenesis (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). To determine if epiboly is disrupted by Ogt overexpression, we monitored the development of live embryos during a time course from 3&#x02013;12 hpf. Ogt overexpressing embryos develop at the same rate as controls during the cleavage stages, and reach the 1000-cell stage at 3 hpf (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9A, E</xref>). Epiboly begins at 4.3 hpf in Ogt overexpressing embryos, as in wild type, and they reach 40% epiboly at 5 hpf (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9B, F</xref>). Occasional blastomeres separate from the blastoderms of Ogt overexpressing embryos during this period, and the remaining blastomeres are unevenly distributed around the margin (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9F</xref>). Gastrulation begins at 6 hpf, and control embryos reach mid-gastrulation two hours later (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9C</xref>). During the same time, epiboly does not progress in Ogt overexpressing embryos, which appear stalled at 40% epiboly (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9G</xref>). Less severely affected embryos progress through epiboly at a slower rate (data not shown). Thus, increased Ogt activity delays the late phase of epiboly, but does not affect the onset or initial progression of epiboly. At 12 hpf, when &#x003b2;-<italic>galactosidase </italic>expressing embryos are at the 3-somite stage (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9D</xref>), a large fraction of Ogt overexpressing embryos degenerate (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9H</xref>; 52/129).

Similarly, the MT filaments appear shorter and thicker in embryos overexpressing hOga (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10C, F</xref>, arrowhead).

This raises the possibility that O-GlcNAc modifies Spg/Pou5f1 protein and regulates its function. Therefore, we asked if this protein is modified by O-GlcNAc. Since there is no antibody for zebrafish Spg/Pou5f1, we asked if human Pou5f1 is modified with O-GlcNAc in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). We found that the O-GlcNAc specific monoclonal antibody RL-2 recognizes a 43 KDa protein immunoprecipitated by the Pou5f1 antibody (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11</xref>, left lane).

Consistent with this, the same band reacts with the Pou5f1 polyclonal antibody when the blot is stripped and reprobed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11</xref>, right lane). This demonstrates that Pou5f1 is modified by O-GlcNAc in hESCs.

We demonstrated that O-GlcNAc modifications control cell survival and epiboly movements in zebrafish embryos, but could find no evidence that they control early cell fate decisions. Furthermore, we observed the same range of defects whether Ogt protein was overexpressed or depleted. Since our enzymes are active in <italic>in vitro </italic>assays, this indicates that embryonic cells are highly sensitive to increases and decreases in the level of O-GlcNAc modifications. Finally, we identified Spg/Pou5f1 as a target for Ogt activity. These findings significantly extend previous genetic analyses of <italic>ogt </italic>function in embryos, and demonstrate that O-GlcNAc modifications regulate the activity of proteins involved in controlling morphogenetic movements.</p><sec><title>Zebrafish have two <italic>ogt </italic>paralogues</title><p>Unlike other vertebrates, zebrafish have two <italic>ogt </italic>genes, which we call <italic>ogta </italic>and <italic>ogtb</italic>, which arose during a recent gene duplication (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A, B</xref>). Previous studies showed that transcripts from both loci encode O-GlcNAc transferase proteins, although one isoform (variant 2) failed to modify full-length p62 protein <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Two lines of evidence indicate variant 2 Ogta can modify proteins other than p62 (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). First, this protein catalyzes the addition of O-GlcNAc to the CKII peptide <italic>in vitro </italic>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). This demonstrates that variant 2 Ogta is catalytically active, but does not provide any information about the endogenous substrates of this enzyme. Secondly, overexpression of variant 2 in embryos causes similar defects as overexpression of variant 4 Ogt, which would not be expected if the protein were catalytically inactive (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5F, G</xref>). In support of this conclusion, we found that variant 2 expressing embryos had increased O-GlcNAc levels as compared to control embryos injected with &#x003b2;-<italic>galactosidase </italic>mRNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). We conclude that variant 2 Ogta is catalytically active. The apparent discrepancy between our results and those of Sohn and Do (2005) could be explained if variant 2 Ogta is unable to recognize p62, but can still recognize other substrates.</p><p>To reduce O-GlcNAc levels, we designed translation-blocking MOs against <italic>ogta </italic>and <italic>ogtb</italic>. Several lines of evidence indicate that the MOs specifically reduced <italic>ogt </italic>function. First, the <italic>ogt </italic>MOs prevented translation of mRNA encoding an Ogt-gfp fusion protein, whereas control MOs had no effect (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E, F</xref>). Second, <italic>ogt </italic>MOs reduced the total amount of O-GlcNAc modifications in the embryo (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2V, W</xref>). This confirms that <italic>ogta </italic>and <italic>ogtb </italic>encode proteins that are required for O-GlcNAc transferase activity <italic>in vivo</italic>. Third, the defects in <italic>ogt </italic>morphants were rescued by co injection of a low dose of <italic>ogt </italic>mRNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Finally, overexpression of hOga, which removes O-GlcNAc from target proteins, caused similar defects to those observed in <italic>ogt </italic>morphants (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>). The fact that MOs did not completely eliminate O-GlcNAc modifications can be explained by the persistence of Ogt protein translated from maternal transcripts prior to MO injection. In addition, each MO was designed to target only one <italic>ogt </italic>gene. Thus, Ogt protein continues to be synthesized from the non-targeted paralogue in <italic>ogt </italic>morphants.</p></sec><sec><title>Gain and loss of <italic>ogt </italic>function produce similar defects</title><p><italic>ogt </italic>morphants were smaller than controls and displayed a dramatic increase in apoptosis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B, C</xref>; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). In addition, the morphants were deficient in endoderm and some mesoderm and ectoderm derivatives (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). It is remarkable that we observe such strong phenotypes with <italic>ogt </italic>MOs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B, C</xref>) that reduced total O-GlcNAc modifications by only 20&#x02013;35% (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2V, W</xref>). This raises the possibility that some Ogt targets may be more sensitive to reductions in O-GlcNAc than others. Furthermore, it suggests that additional roles for O-GlcNAc modifications could be uncovered if the amount of O-GlcNAc modifications were reduced to a greater extent, perhaps by co-injection of both MO1 and MO2. Given the dramatic increase in apoptosis in <italic>Ogt </italic>morphants (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>), however, it is possible that further reductions in O-GlcNAc levels would merely result in more dead or dying cells.</p><p>In a complementary approach, we overexpressed two variants of zebrafish Ogt. The resulting embryos were smaller than controls, and lacked endoderm and some ectoderm and mesoderm derivatives (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Cell counts revealed that Ogt overexpressing embryos had significantly fewer cells than controls, due to a concomitant increase in cell death (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). Thus, embryonic development is severely disrupted by reducing O-GlcNAc levels by 20&#x02013;35% as well as by increasing Ogt levels. This suggests that O-GlcNAc modifications must be maintained within a fairly narrow range for normal development. Surprisingly, decreasing O-GlcNAc levels produced the same range of defects as those observed in Ogt overexpressing embryos. This indicates that both the addition of O-GlcNAc to target proteins and its removal are essential for embryonic development. This is consistent with the idea that O-GlcNAc cycles on and off proteins, controlling a switch between two different active states [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>O-GlcNAc levels control the morphogenetic movements of epiboly</title><p>Our results indicate that gastrulation stage embryos are especially sensitive to changes in O-GlcNAc levels.

We did not observe delays in epiboly in <italic>ogt </italic>morphants, probably because these embryos continue expressing a significant amount of Ogt protein, as described above.</p><p>Control of morphogenetic movements represents a new role for O-GlcNAc modifications. To understand how O-GlcNAc might act during epiboly, we examined the MT and actin cytoskeleton in the yolk (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10</xref>). We found that the MT network in the cortical cytoplasm was disrupted in Ogt overexpressing embryos, with the MTs forming shortened, thickened filaments. The MT network is also disrupted in embryos overexpressing hOga. Similarly, the contractile actin ring in the YSL is absent in embryos overexpressing Ogt and hOga. We conclude that O-GlcNAc either directly or indirectly regulates that cytoskeletal network in the yolk.</p><p>The similarities between embryos overexpressing Ogt or hOga and those lacking the pou class transcription factor Spg/Pou5f1, suggest that Spg/Pou5f1 protein is a target of Ogt and that O-GlcNAc inactivates Spg/Pou5f1 protein. Consistent with this, we found that Pou5f1 protein immunoprecipitated from undifferentiated human ES cells is modified by O-GlcNAc. There is a high degree of sequence homology between human Pou5f1 and zebrafish Spg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">74</xref>]. Mouse Pou5f1 can rescue <italic>spg </italic>mutants, indicating a high degree of functional conservation between the two proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">75</xref>]. Therefore, it is highly likely that zebrafish Spg protein is also modified by Ogt. It is not known how O-GlcNAc modification regulates Pou5f1 function. Like many targets of Ogt, Pou5f1 is also modified by phosphorylation and the ability of Pou5f1 to stimulate transcription correlates with its phosphorylation status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">76</xref>]. Depending upon which residues are modified, O-GlcNAc may stimulate or inhibit phosphorylation of Spg/Pou5f1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Further experiments are necessary to identify the residues modified by O-GlcNAc and to determine the functional consequences of O-GlcNAcylation on Spg/Pou5f1 protein.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>O-GlcNAc modifications are a poorly understood post-translational mechanism for regulating embryonic development. We demonstrated that embryonic O-GlcNAc levels control epiboly movements and cell survival, but do not regulate the initial cell fate decisions. Interestingly, gain and loss of <italic>ogt </italic>function produced the same range of defects. This indicates that the overall level of O-GlcNAc modification must be tightly controlled for normal embryonic development. Finally, O-GlcNAc modifies the pou class transcription factor Pou5f1 in human embryonic stem cells. Although the effect of this modification on Pou5f1 activity is not yet understood, it is possible that some of the defects described in this paper are mediated by improper regulation of Pou5f1.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Zebrafish strains, staging and imaging live embryos</title><p>We obtained wild type embryos by natural mating of WIK adults.

Dissociated cells were collected in plastic tubes and placed at 4&#x000b0;C. To concentrate the cells, we pelleted the cells by centrifugation at 2000 g for 10 min. The pellet was resuspended in 250 &#x003bc;l PBS, 1% BSA. The mixture of cells was analyzed in a LSR-II Analyzer (BD Biosciences) with BD FACSDiva 4.2 software. To detect cells containing FITC-dextran, the samples were excited by a sapphire blue laser at 488 nm, and the emission wavelength was detected with a 530 +/- 30 band-pass filter. To detect cells containing AlexaFluor-647-dextran, samples were excited with a HeNe laser at 633 nm, and the emission fluorescence was detected with a 660 +/-20 band-pass filter.
