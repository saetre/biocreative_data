Despite many advances in neuroblastoma research, 60% of neuroblastoma, which are essentially metastatic cases, are associated with poor clinical outcome due to the lack of effectiveness of current therapeutic strategies. Membrane-type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP, MMP-14), an enzyme involved in several steps in tumor progression, has previously been shown to be associated with poor clinical outcome for neuroblastoma. Based on our recent demonstration that MT1-MMP phosphorylation is involved in the growth of fibrosarcoma tumors, we examined the potential role of phosphorylated MT1-MMP in neuroblastoma progression.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Tyrosine phosphorylated MT1-MMP was immunostained on tissue microarray samples from 55 patients with neuroblastoma detected by mass screening (known to be predominantly associated with favourable outcome), and from 234 patients with standard diagnosed neuroblastoma.

NB is a neuroendocrine malignant tumor of the autonomic nervous system that arises from neural crest cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. NB shows heterogeneous pathological characteristics due to its variable sites of origin, diverse histopathologic appearance and biologic characteristics. This malignant tumor exhibits a broad spectrum of clinical features, including spontaneous regression without any treatment, maturation to a benign ganglioneuroma, or progression to metastasis leading to death. Numerous factors, such as patient's age at diagnostic, stage of disease, tumor histopathology and genetic abnormalities have all been shown to influence NB progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Among them, the metastatic status (Stage 4) is a very strong prognosis factor indicating poor outcome. Survival of children older than one year with an advanced stage of NB is poor despite aggressive treatment, as opposed to the survival of children younger than one year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. NB secretes catecholamine metabolites that are excreted in urine, offering a non-invasive diagnostic technique. This observation has led to the suggestion of screening for NB in infants using specific catecholamine markers. Large studies showed that mass screening did not appear to reduce neither the disease-related mortality nor the yearly numbers of aggressive NB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Moreover, patients with mass screening-detected NB very rarely died from tumor progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Although the mechanisms underlying NB progression have been under intense investigation, therapeutic advances have failed to significantly increase the survival rates of children with aggressive NB.</p><p>Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), a family of zinc-dependent endopeptidases that degrade extracellular matrix (ECM) components, play crucial roles in several processes underlying tumor progression, including cell attachment, cell migration, invasiveness, cell proliferation, apoptosis, and angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. There are 23 different human MMPs described to date, some of which are secreted in the pericellular environment while others are associated with the cell membrane. Membrane-type 1 matrix metalloproteinase (MT1-MMP, MMP-14), the best characterized membrane-anchored MMP, plays essential roles in tumor cell migration and invasion by acting as a potent matrix-degrading protease that digests a broad spectrum of ECM proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] as well as a number of cell surface-associated adhesion receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. In particular, elegant studies have unequivocally shown that MT1-MMP-mediated pericellular proteolysis of the ECM is essential for tissue-invasive activity of tumor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] as well as for tumor cell growth in an otherwise growth-restrictive three-dimensional (3-D) environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Accordingly, MT1-MMP is overexpressed in many types of tumors, including breast, colon, head and neck [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], cervical [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], gastric [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] and lung [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] carcinomas, as well as in brain tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Moreover, MT1-MMP expression has been shown to correlate with unfavourable outcome in pediatric NB patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>In addition to its important matrix-degrading activity, MT1-MMP contains a short cytoplasmic sequence that is involved in regulation of the enzyme activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] as well as in the activation of signal transduction processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Previous work from our laboratory has also shown that MT1-MMP is phosphorylated on its unique cytoplasmic tyrosine residue and that this phosphorylation also participates in tumor cell migration and invasion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. We have also shown that impaired tyrosine phosphorylation of MT1-MMP markedly reduced the tumorigenic properties of the highly invasive HT-1080 fibrosarcoma, leading to a complete inhibition of tumor growth in nude mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].</p><p>The aim of the present study is to investigate the role of tyrosine phosphorylated MT1-MMP (pMT1-MMP) in NB progression and its relation to clinical outcome. We report herein that tyrosine phosphorylation of the enzyme plays an important role in NB cell migration and proliferation within 3D collagen matrix <italic>in vitro</italic>. Furthermore, expression of pMT1-MMP correlated with some clinical features, patient age at diagnosis and mass screening versus standard NB, which are associated with poor prognosis in NB pediatric patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Patients</title><p>The study protocol have been performed with the approval of the CHU Sainte-Justine Ethic Committee of Research (protocol 2244), in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration. All tumor samples used in this study were obtained at diagnosis. Tumor samples from mass screening for NB were collected from 55 patients in two different countries: 35 came from Qu&#x000e9;bec (Canada) and 20 from Otsu (Japan, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]) (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Tumors were diagnosed between August 1989 and April 2002 with a median follow-up of 170 months. Among these 55 patients, there were 26 girls and 29 boys with a median age of 7 months. Three patients were older than one year at diagnosis and one tumor had MYCN amplification. According to the International Neuroblastoma Staging System classification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], there were 16 patients in stage 1, 15 in stage 2, 9 in stage 3, 6 in stage 4 and 9 in stage 4S. One patient died from NB. Tumors samples from standard NB came from 234 patients with NB who were treated and followed in four centers: Bic&#x000ea;tre hospital (Le Kremlin-Bic&#x000ea;tre, France), Gustave Roussy Institute (Villejuif, France), the American Hospital (Reims, France) and CHU Sainte-Justine (Montr&#x000e9;al, Canada). These patients were diagnosed between July 1988 and March 2008, with a median follow-up of 58.5 months. 167 patients were still alive at the last follow-up.

As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, due to elevated basal expression of MT1-MMP in SK-N-SH cells, overexpression of WT MT1-MMP in these cells had a relatively low stimulatory effect on cell migration while the Y573F mutant strongly diminished both cell migration and MT1-MMP phosphorylation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A-B</xref>). However, in the NB-10 cells which express low basal levels of MT1-MMP, overexpression of WT MT1-MMP markedly increased cell migration (3-fold), this effect being completely abolished by overexpression of the Y573F mutant (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>).

Previous study from our laboratory demonstrated that the inhibitory effect of the Y573F dominant-negative mutant of MT1-MMP on tumor cell proliferation is not related to defective proteolysis, since this mutant retained the ability to activate proMMP-2 and to degrade type I collagen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. The inhibitory effect of the Y573F mutant on NB cell migration and proliferation correlated with a decrease in the levels of phosphorylated MT1-MMP (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Moreover, serum-induced relocalization of tyrosine phosphorylated MT1-MMP to peripheral actin-rich structures, a process important for cell migration, was completely abolished by overexpression of the non-phosphorylable mutant of MT1-MMP (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]).</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Localization of tyrosine phosphorylated MT1-MMP in NB cells</bold>.

In addition, our previous findings suggest that phosphorylation of MT1-MMP is observed under tumorigenic rather than normal conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Therefore, phosphorylation of MT1-MMP could represent the ''molecular switch" in NB cells responsible for the evolution from benign to malignant tumor. The identification of pMT1-MMP as an important player in the process of NB progression could be useful for the development of new therapeutic strategies for NB patients who cannot be cured with current therapeutic approaches.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>CN participated in the design of the study, carried out the <italic>in vitro </italic>experiments, participated in tissue microarray analysis and drafted the manuscript.
