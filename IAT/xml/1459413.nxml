An interesting feature of the polypurine G-rich strand of NHPPE is its ability to assume an unusual DNA structure that, according to circular dichroism (CD) and DMS footprinting experiments, is attributed to an intramolecular parallel G-quadruplex, consisting of three G-tetrads and three loops. The human and mouse <italic>KRAS</italic> NHPPE G-rich strands display melting temperature of 64 and 73&#x000b0;C, respectively, as well as a K<sup>+</sup>-dependent capacity to arrest DNA polymerase. Photocleavage and CD experiments showed that the cationic porphyrin TMPyP4 stacks to the external G-tetrads of the <italic>KRAS</italic> quadruplexes, increasing the <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> by &#x0223c;20&#x000b0;C. These findings raise the intriguing question that the G-quadruplex formed within the NHPPE of <italic>KRAS</italic> may be involved in the regulation of transcription. Indeed, transfection experiments showed that the activity of the mouse <italic>KRAS</italic> promoter is reduced to 20% of control, in the presence of the quadruplex-stabilizing TMPyP4. In addition, we found that G-rich oligonucleotides mimicking the <italic>KRAS</italic> quadruplex, but not the corresponding 4-base mutant sequences or oligonucleotides forming quadruplexes with different structures, competed with the NHPPE duplex for binding to nuclear proteins. When vector pKRS-413, containing CAT driven by the mouse <italic>KRAS</italic> promoter, and <italic>KRAS</italic> quadruplex oligonucleotides were co-transfected in 293 cells, the expression of CAT was found to be downregulated to 40% of the control. On the basis of these data, we propose that the NHPPE of <italic>KRAS</italic> exists in equilibrium between a double-stranded form favouring transcription and a folded quadruplex form, which instead inhibits transcription. Such a mechanism, which is probably adopted by other growth-related genes, provides useful hints for the rational design of anticancer drugs against the <italic>KRAS</italic> oncogene.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma is an aggressive disease, which is characterized by a rapid progression and little response to conventional cancer treatments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>). Like many other tumours, pancreatic cancer results from the accumulation of genetic lesions in various genes: proto-oncogenes, tumour-suppression and maintenance genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>). The <italic>KRAS</italic> gene is located in chromosome 12, locus 12p12.1, and encodes for a 21 kDa protein, p21<sup>RAS</sup>, which is anchored to the inner surface of the plasma membrane and acts as a molecular switch that transmits to the nucleus, through the Raf-MAP kinase pathway, signals that influence cell growth and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>). Protein p21<sup>RAS</sup> exists in two states, a GTP-bound active state and a GDP-bound inactive state. The activity of p21<sup>RAS</sup> is regulated positively by nucleotide exchange factors and negatively by a GTPase activating protein. When there is a point mutation in codon 12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>), the protein is locked in the active state and constitutively transmits to the nucleus mitogenic signals. In a recent work, Hingorani <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>) have investigated the role of oncogenic RAS mutations in the pancreatic tumorigenesis. They demonstrated that the endogenous expression of an oncogenic <italic>KRAS</italic> allele (<italic>KRAS</italic><sup>G12D</sup>) in mouse pancreas initiates the development of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma in a way identical to that occurring in the cognate human condition. The rapid accumulation of knowledge on the molecular biology of pancreatic adenocarcinoma has stimulated the development of targeted therapies for this disease. Strategies aiming at the suppression of <italic>KRAS</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>) or inactivation of the Ras protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>) have been proposed. In this context, we have addressed our efforts on a polypurine&#x02013;polypyrimidine motif located in the <italic>KRAS</italic> promoter, between nt &#x02212;327 and &#x02212;296 in human; &#x02212;318 and &#x02212;290 in mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). Polypurine&#x02013;polypyrimidine motifs are simple repeats distributed through the eukaryotic genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>) and often are present in the 5&#x02032; region of the genes. The <italic>CMYC</italic> region between &#x02212;142 and &#x02212;115 from the P1 promoter which controls 80&#x02013;90% of transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>), harbours a polypurine&#x02013;polypyrimidine motif that extrudes a G-quadruplex structure involved in transcription regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the 5&#x02032; region of <italic>HSP26</italic> and <italic>HSP70</italic> contains a polypurine&#x02013;polypyrimidine stretch that binds to nuclear proteins and activates transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). In the proximal promoter region of the human VEGF gene there is a <italic>polypurine-polypyrimidine</italic> sequence forming a G-quadruplex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>). In addition, other genes contain oligopurine tracts in the regulatory regions (e.g. c-fes/fps, c-ets-2, c-myb, c-src) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>). Studies on chromatin showed that the <italic>KRAS</italic> polypurine&#x02013;polypyrimidine motif is a nuclease hypersensitive element (NHPPE), suggesting that it may adopt a non-B-DNA structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). NHPPE is essential for the promoter activity as its excision results in a significant downregulation of transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). Owing to its critical role, we have previously targeted NHPPE with triplex-forming oligonucleotides (TFOs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>). In the first approach we successfully targeted a reporter gene driven by the <italic>KRAS</italic> promoter. However, when the designed TFOs were used against endogenous <italic>KRAS</italic>, we did not obtain satisfactory results. We though that the TFO uptake might be a serious obstacle, thus we obtained from Panc-1 cells a stable transfectant line in which an anti-<italic>KRAS</italic> TFO was endogenously produced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). In the transfectant line, we observed that oncogenic <italic>KRAS</italic> was downregulated and as a result cell proliferation and colony formation were strongly reduced, while apoptosis was enhanced. However, we believed that these cellular effects could not be ascribed to the formation of a triplex between the endogenous TFO and NHPPE, as <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments suggested that the RNA&#x02022;DNA&#x02022;DNA triplex was not stable enough to elicit such strong cellular effects. Interestingly, we found that the anti <italic>KRAS</italic> activity of the endogenous TFO correlated with its ability assume a G-quadruplex that recognises a nuclear protein binding to the NHPPE duplex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>). In the present work we report that the purine strand of NHPPE, located in the proximal promoter sequence of <italic>KRAS</italic>, is also able to form a G-quadruplex, suggesting that this unusual DNA structure may be involved in transcription. We have characterized the G-quadruplexes formed in the mouse and human promoters through electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), circular dichroism (CD), chemical probing with DMS/piperidine and polymerase stop assays. Transfection experiments showed that the stabilization of the <italic>KRAS</italic> G-quadruplex with the cationic porphyrin TMPyP4 results in a strong inhibition of <italic>KRAS</italic> transcription. Furthermore, DNA&#x02013;protein competition assays showed that the mouse and human <italic>KRAS</italic> G-quadruplexes recognize a nuclear protein that binds to duplex NHPPE. The sequestration of this protein by an oligonucleotide mimicking the <italic>KRAS</italic> G-quadruplex, induced a transcription inhibition to 40% of control. Our data suggest a transcription mechanism that involves the formation of a G-quadruplex within the <italic>KRAS</italic> promoter and shed light on new molecular strategies to suppress the expression of <italic>KRAS</italic> in tumour cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>DNA samples</title><p>The oligonucleotides illustrated in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> were obtained from Sigma-Proligo (Paris, France).

This sequence is located between nt &#x02212;318/&#x02212;290 in mouse (Accession no. M16708), &#x02212;327/&#x02212;296 in human (Accession no. L00044), positions relative to the exon 0/intron 1 boundary. Previous studies have shown that NHPPE is bound by nuclear proteins and plays an essential role in transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). The NHPPE sequences are highly conserved in mouse and human and characterized by a high C+G content (72% mouse, 67% human) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Here, we asked whether the G-rich strands of the NHPPEs adopt a non-B-DNA structure. Since G-rich oligonucleotides can form quadruplex structures in KCl (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>), we analysed by CD the purine strands of the mouse and human NHPPEs, namely 28Rm and 32Rh, and the corresponding 4-base mutant sequences, 28Rmut and 32Rmut, in 50 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl, pH 7.4 and 100 mM KCl. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> shows that both 32Rh and 28Rm exhibit a CD spectrum characterized by a strong and positive ellipticity at 260 nm and a weaker and negative ellipticity at 240 nm. This spectrum is similar to those reported for oligonucleotides that are known to assume a parallel quadruplex structure, d(TGGGGT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>) and d(GGA)<sub>4</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>). Interestingly, the CD spectra of the 4-base mutants 28Rmut and 32Rmut, in which the central guanine in four runs of guanines (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) has been replaced with cytosine, appear dramatically different and not consistent with a quadruplex structure. Another evidence that the <italic>KRAS</italic> G-rich sequences form a G-quadruplex structure was obtained by UV thermal difference spectra (TDS), as they provide a distinctive spectroscopic signature for G-quadruplex formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>). We have, measured the TDS spectra of 32Rh, 28Rm and, for comparison, of the <italic>CMYC</italic> sequence (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), that is known to form a parallel quadruplex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>). The spectra obtained (Supplementary Figures S1 and S2) show the typical features of quadruplex DNA, with negative minima at 262 and 295 nm, positive maxima at 255 and 270, a shoulder at 245 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>). To determine the stability of the putative parallel G-quadruplexes formed by 28Rm and 32Rh, we measured the CD spectra as a function of temperature and plotted the ellipticity at 260 nm versus temperature. We obtained two melting curves showing that the human and mouse G-quadruplexes denatured in a cooperative way with <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub>'s of 64 and 73&#x000b0;C, respectively (data not shown). We then wondered whether the parallel quadruplexes formed by the two <italic>KRAS</italic> promoter sequences are intra- or intermolecular. To answer this question, we analysed the electrophoretic mobilities of 28Rm, 32Rh, 28Rmut and 32Rmut, under native conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The wild-type sequences (5 nM), incubated either in NaCl or KCl, migrated in a 20% polyacrylamide gel much faster than the corresponding duplexes. The mobility appeared only slightly slower than the complementary pyrimidine strands or 4-base mutants, which migrate as single-stranded species. This suggests that both 28Rm and 32Rh adopt an intramolecular quadruplex structure. In fact, increasing 200-fold the oligonucleotide concentration from 5 nM to 1 &#x003bc;M, the mobility of the wild-type sequences does not change [lane 5 (mouse); lane 9 (human)]. In principle, both 28Rm and 32Rh could form G&#x02013;G hairpins that associate into bimolecular quadruplexes. However, these quadruplexes should have a mobility not much different from that of the duplex; for instance TAG<sub>3</sub>TTAG<sub>3</sub>T, whose crystal shows that it forms a parallel bimolecular quadruplex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>), migrates in much the same way as the duplex does (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>). Finally, the observations that (i) the CD spectra of 28Rm and 32Rh do not change following a DNA dilution from 2 &#x003bc;M to 200 nM (data not shown), (ii) 28Rm and 32Rh after denaturing give rapidly the typical CD signature and electrophoretic mobility (lanes 6 and 7 mouse; lanes 5 and 6 human), argue strongly in favour of an intramolecular folding.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>KRAS</italic> G-quadruplex arrests DNA polymerase</title><p>It has been shown that G-quadruplex structures are able to block primer extension by DNA polymerase in a K<sup>+</sup>-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>). We therefore designed four DNA templates&#x02014;two containing the mouse and human wild-type G-rich sequences, two containing the 4-base mutant sequences&#x02014;and analysed their capacity to form an intramolecular G-quadruplex by a DNA polymerase arrest assay. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> shows the results of primer extension experiments performed with the mouse templates at 37&#x000b0;C, in the presence of NaCl, KCl or KCl+TMPyP4 (tetra-(<italic>N</italic>-methyl-4-pyridil porphyrin), a cationic porphyrin that stabilizes quadruplex DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>). In order to determine the exact point in which DNA polymerase was arrested, we sequenced the template by the Sanger (dideoxy) method (lanes 1&#x02013;4). A potassium-dependent arrest of DNA polymerase at the adenine preceding the first run of guanines at the 3&#x02032; side of the G-rich sequence can be seen in lanes 6 and 7. This premature chain termination product appeared stronger in the presence of the stabilizing ligand TMPyP4. In addition to the primary pausing site at the beginning of the G-rich motif, a secondary pausing site is observed at the adenine preceding the second run of guanines. This suggests the formation of an alternative G-quadruplex within the mouse G-rich motif, starting from the second 3&#x02032; G-run. Note that in the presence of NaCl, DNA polymerase was not arrested and produced a full length transcript (lane 5). It is noteworthy that when 4 guanines are replaced with cytosines, the polymerase was not arrested, indicating that the 4-base mutant sequence did not form a G-quadruplex, in accord with PAGE and CD (lanes 8&#x02013;10). Next, we wondered whether the <italic>KRAS</italic> G-quadruplex can be extruded from a double-stranded template containing NHPPE. We performed primer extension experiments using as template plasmid pKRS-413, which contains the mouse <italic>KRAS</italic> promoter. We designed a primer complementary to a sequence located downstream from the G-rich motif, which was used for both DNA sequencing and primer extension reactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). It can be seen that DNA polymerase is arrested at the adenine preceding the first 3&#x02032; run of guanines, in perfect accord with the results obtained with the single-stranded template. The arrest of polymerase is potassium-dependent and stronger in the presence of TMPyP4. In this case too, a secondary and weaker pausing site is observed at the adenine preceding the second 3&#x02032; G-run. The polymerase stop assay was also performed with the human single- and double-stranded templates and obtained results similar to those observed for the parental mouse templates (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Determination of <italic>KRAS</italic> G-quadruplex structures by DMS footprinting</title><p>To determine the nature of the G-quadruplexes formed by the <italic>KRAS</italic> G-rich sequences, we probed the accessibility of guanine N7 to DMS. While in duplex and single-stranded DNA guanine N7 is available for methylation with DMS, in quadruplex DNA, being involved in a Hoogsteen hydrogen bond, N7 does not react with DMS. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> (left panel) shows the results of a methylation assay performed on the mouse 28Rm sequence in the denatured state (lanes 1&#x02013;3), after incubation in KCl (lane 4) or KCl+TMPyP4 (lane 5). It can be seen that in the presence of KCl and TMPyP4, most guanines are protected from methylation and thus involved in G-tetrads, except G14 and G15 and, to a lesser extent G17&#x02013;G19. Taking into account the CD, PAGE and primer extension experiments, we propose for this promoter sequence an intramolecular parallel G-quadruplex that consists of three G-tetrads, two one-base and one nine-base external loops (structure Q[1/1/9], left). Such a propeller type quadruplex conformation has been found for the telomere d[AGGG(TTAGGG)3] in the crystalline state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>). Since primer extension experiments showed a secondary polymerase pause at the adenine preceding the second 3&#x02032; G-run, an alternative quadruplex with two one-base and a 5-base external loops, called Q[1/1/5], can be formed. Of the two quadruplex loop isomers, Q[1/1/9] should have a higher stability, according to polymerase stop assays. As the topology of the loops cannot be predicted from DMS footprinting data, we cannot rule out that the 9-base loop of Q[1/1/9] has a diagonal topology as depicted in Q[1/1/9], right. Interestingly, when a guanine in the G-runs involved in the tetrads is substituted with cytosine, the resulting 4-base mutant sequence exhibits a dramatically different DMS-induced cleavage pattern, where all the guanines are modified and cleaved by DMS/piperidine. This suggests that 28Rmut does not adopt a quadruplex structure, in perfect accord with CD, PAGE and primer extension experiments. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> shows the DMS footprinting for the human G-rich sequence. In this sequence the guanines are distributed less regularly than in the mouse sequence and three pyrimidines disrupt the polypurine motif. However, when the two sequences are aligned one against the other, their sequence homology appears evident. In the presence of KCl (lanes 3 and 5) or KCl+TMPyP4 (lanes 4 and 6), a precise cleavage pattern is obtained, with G9, G16, G18, G19, G20 and G23 showing a high reactivity with DMS. This cleavage profile shares common features with the profile obtained with the mouse sequence and supports the formation of a parallel G-quadruplex stabilized by three G-tetrads and three external loops (or two external and one diagonal loops), as the G-quadruplex proposed for the mouse sequence. Note that G29, but not the expected G28, is methylated by DMS: this is probably due to the fact that TMPyP4 interacts with the adenine bridging G29 and G31 rather than with G28 in the miniloop. Again, the 4-base mutant sequence did not show any footprint. To futher support the quadruplex structure proposed for the human <italic>KRAS</italic> sequence we compared the <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> and CD spectrum of 32Rh with those relative to a number of mutant sequences. Interestingly, we did not observe changes in CD shape and <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> when G18, G19, G20 or G9, G16, G23, were replaced with thymidines. Conversely, when guanines involved in a G-tetrad such as G12, G26 or G29 were substituted with thymidines, dramatic changes in both the CD and <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> were observed (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Interaction between TMPyP4 with <italic>KRAS</italic> quadruplexes</title><p>Previous studies have demonstrated that the cationic porphyrin TMPyP4 stabilizes quadruplex DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>). We first examined the interaction between TMPyP4 and the mouse <italic>KRAS</italic> G-quadruplex by CD experiments. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> shows the CD spectra of 3 &#x003bc;M 28Rm incubated in KCl or KCl with three equivalents of TMPyP4. Although TMPyP4 is achiral, a negative ellipticity appeared in the region of the porphyrin Soret band (&#x0223c;430 nm) as a result of the binding of the ligand to the G-quadruplex. To determine the stabilizing effect of TMPyP4 on the mouse quadruplex, we measured the CD spectrum as a function of temperature, finding that the <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> increased from 75 to &#x0003e;95&#x000b0;C (at 95&#x000b0;C the quadruplex was not yet denatured). To gain insight into the interaction between the cationic porphyrin and the mouse <italic>KRAS</italic> G-quadruplex, we performed photocleavage experiments. TMPyP4 catalyses the oxidation of DNA upon exposure to light, resulting in DNA strand breakage in proximity of the binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>). The photocleavage of 28Rm and its correspondent 4-base mutant sequence 28Rmut is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>. The two oligonucleotides show a distinct photocleavage pattern. Considering that TMPyP4 stabilizes the quadruplex isomer with a 9-base loop, the DNA photodamage occurs to the guanines of the external G-tetrads (G5, G9, G25 and G27, indicated with red arrows) and the guanines in the nine-base loop (G17, G18, G19, blue arrows). As G26, although located in the internal G-tetrad, is cleaved may be due to the fact that a fraction of 28Rm adopts the Q[1/1/5] conformation, in which the first 3&#x02032; run of guanines is excluded to the structure and is free to interact electrostatically with TMPyP4. In conclusion, the data support the notion that TMPyP4 binds to the mouse <italic>KRAS</italic> quadruplex by end-stacking to the external G-tetrads and electrostatically to the bases of the larger loop. These modes of binding are in keeping with previous results obtained with telomeric DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>) and with the <italic>CMYC</italic> quadruplex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Quadruplex-stabilizing TMPyP4 strongly inhibits the activity of the of <italic>KRAS</italic> promoter</title><p>The critical role played on transcription by the <italic>KRAS</italic> NHPPE sequence motif has been demonstrated elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). Considering that NHPPE extrudes a G-quadruplex structure, that is strongly stabilized by TMPyP4, we wished to evaluate if this unusual DNA conformation does affect transcription. It has been shown that TMPyP4 inhibits telomerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>), helicase-mediated unwinding of G-quadruplex structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>) and downregulates the expression of <italic>CMYC</italic>, whose promoter also forms a G-quadruplex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>). In order to investigate the effect of the cationic porphyrin on the activity of the <italic>KRAS</italic> promoter, we co-transfected 293 cells with plasmid pKRS-413, bearing the mouse <italic>KRAS</italic> promoter upstream from the reporter CAT gene, plasmid pTK &#x003b2;-gal as a control and increasing quantities of TMPyP4 (up to 20 &#x003bc;M). We measured the expression of CAT relatively to that of &#x003b2;-gal by ELISA assays, 48 h after transfection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). We found that at all the concentrations used, TMPyP4 reduced the expression of CAT to 20% of the control, indicating that the stabilization of the G-quadruplex has a strong repression effect on transcription. This experiment suggests that the quadruplex structure formed locally in the mouse <italic>KRAS</italic> promoter at NHPPE behaves as a transcription repressor.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>KRAS</italic> G-quadruplex recognises nuclear proteins</title><p>The NHPPE of <italic>KRAS</italic> is the target of nuclear proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). Little is known about these proteins except that they bind to a promoter region that plays an essential role for transcription. We performed EMSA with NIH 3T3 nuclear extracts and the mouse <sup>32</sup>P-labelled NHPPE duplex as a probe. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref> shows that three protein&#x02013;DNA complexes (M1&#x02013;M3) are formed. These binding activities are sequence-specific, as the experiments have been carried out in the presence of a large excess of polyd(I&#x02013;C). When increasing amounts of cold G-rich oligonucleotide 28Rm and 32Rh, mimicking the mouse and human <italic>KRAS</italic> G-quadruplexes, are added to the reaction mixture, they effectively competed with the probe for protein binding. An oligonucleotide concentration 100-fold in excess over probe (radiolabelled NHPPE duplex, 5 nM), is sufficient to abrogate the interaction responsible for the formation of complexes M1 and M2 (lanes 4 and 7), whereas the 4-base mutant oligonucleotide 28Rmut, at identical concentrations, had no effect (lanes 8&#x02013;10). This indicates that the proteins in M1 and M2 are recognized not only by the NHPPE duplex but also by the G-quadruplexes formed by the G-rich strands of mouse and human NHPPEs. The interaction between these proteins and the <italic>KRAS</italic> quadruplexes is highly stereospecific, as UGGGGU, forming a parallel quadruplex without loops (called Q1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>), does not compete with the duplex probe (lane 14). EMSA experiments were also performed with nuclear extracts from human Panc-1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). In this case we observed two DNA&#x02013;protein complexes (H1 and H2) of which H1 is competed by the <italic>KRAS</italic> quadruplexes. Here too, no competition is observed with the 4-base mutant 28Rmut (lanes 6&#x02013;8), Q1 and Q2, a G-quadruplex with lateral loops formed by GUUUUUGGGGCUUUUC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>) (lanes 11 and 12). Interestingly, the quadruplex formed by the G-rich sequence present in the <italic>CMYC</italic> promoter shows some competition with the duplex probe (lanes 13 and 14). When we used the human NHPPE duplex as probe, we practically obtained the same results (data not shown). To further characterize the binding between the mouse <italic>KRAS</italic> quadruplex and the nuclear proteins, we performed a Southwestern analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>). Nuclear extracts from mouse NIH 3T3 (M) and human Panc-1 (H) cells were run in SDS&#x02013;PAGE and assayed with <sup>32</sup>P-labelled 28Rm in the quadruplex conformation and <sup>32</sup>P-labelled 28Rmut. Three binding activities are observed with the mouse extract (at &#x0223c;32, 75 and 120 kDa), whereas only two bands (32 and 75 kDa) are obtained with the human extract. In accord with EMSA competition assays, the 4-base mutant oligonucleotides did not show any binding activity. To find out if the bands observed in the Southwestern blot are the subunits of a larger protein, we performed UV-cross linking experiments under native conditions, but unfortunately were not able to obtain reproducible results. Finally, we addressed the question if the proteins that bind to both the quadruplex and duplex conformations of mouse NHPPE are essential for <italic>KRAS</italic> transcription. We reasoned that an oligonucleotide mimicking the mouse <italic>KRAS</italic> G-quadruplex should behave as an aptamer and cause a transcription repression if the proteins that it binds to are essential for transcription. As proof of principle we transfected 293 cells with plasmid pKRS-413, containing CAT driven by the mouse <italic>KRAS</italic> promoter, pTK &#x003b2;-gal and 1 &#x003bc;M oligonucleotides 28Rm, 32Rh, 28Rmut and 32Rmut. The results obtained are reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref> which shows that the <italic>KRAS</italic> transcription is reduced up to 40% of the control in the presence of the quadruplex-forming oligonucleotides. This is observed with both mouse and human G-quadruplexes, indicating that the protein(s) binding to the <italic>KRAS</italic> G-quadruplex is(are) essential elements for transcription.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In this work we have demonstrated that the G-rich strand of NHPPE, located within the proximal promoter region of <italic>KRAS</italic>, is able to form a G-quadruplex structure that seems to be involved in the mechanism of transcription regulation. As the NHPPEs present in the human and mouse <italic>KRAS</italic> genes share a high sequence homology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), this structural polymorphism is observed in both gene promoters. In order to gain insight into the nature of these quadruplexes, we performed spectroscopic and enzymatic experiments. CD (strong ellipticity at 260 nm) and UV TDS (maximum at 273 nm) showed spectral features indicative of the formation of a parallel G-quadruplex structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>). To discover whether the <italic>KRAS</italic> quadruplexes are intra- or intermolecular, we analysed the mobility of the G-rich sequences in a native polyacrylamide gel. As they migrated much faster than the corresponding NHPPE duplexes and slightly slower than the 4-base mutants, we concluded that they assume an intramolecular folded quadruplex. The <italic>KRAS</italic> G-quadruplexes were sufficiently stable [<italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> = 64&#x000b0;C (human) and 73&#x000b0;C (mouse) in 100 mM KCl] to act as a barrier for DNA polymerase. The arrest of DNA synthesis was found to be K<sup>+</sup>-dependent and stronger in the presence of the cationic porphyrin TMPyP4, which is known to stabilize quadruplex DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>). The polymerase stop assays were performed with both single- and double-stranded templates and showed that the main arrest of DNA polymerase occurred at the base preceding the first run of guanines at the 3&#x02032; side of the G-rich sequence. However, a secondary enzymatic pause was observed at the beginning of the second G-run, in keeping with the formation of two quadruplex structures within the mouse G-rich strand. An in-depth investigation on the structure of the <italic>KRAS</italic> G-quadruplexes was obtained by DMS-footprinting experiments. The cleavage patterns obtained with the two <italic>KRAS</italic> G-rich sequences are consistent with the formation of a parallel G-quadruplex structure characterized by three G-tetrads and three loops. As DMS-footprinting data do not give information about the topology of the loops, the three loops may be either all external (propeller conformation), as found in the telomere d[AGGG(TTAGGG)3] repeat in the crystalline state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>), or two external and one diagonal, as depicted in the structures of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>. Moreover, as the mouse G-rich sequence comprises six runs of guanines, two quadruplexes are formed, as suggested by the double arrest observed in the DNA polymerase stop assay. In nice accord with CD and polymerase stop assays, the 4-base mutants did not give a DMS footprinting. The cationic porphyrin TMPyP4 was found to stabilize the G-quadruplexes by &#x0223c;20&#x000b0;C. According to photocleavage experiments, the porphyrin should stack to the external G-tetrads of the mouse quadruplex and also interacts electrostatically with the bases of the larger loop. To uncover the biological function of the <italic>KRAS</italic> G-quadruplex, we transfected 293 cells with increasing amounts of TMPyP4 and vector pKRS-413, containing CAT driven by the mouse <italic>KRAS</italic> promoter. We found that the porphyrin promoted a strong suppression of CAT to &#x0223c;20% of control, suggesting that the G-quadruplex acts as a transcription repressor. A similar result has been observed for <italic>CMYC</italic>, whose promoter also contains a polypurine&#x02013;polypyrimidine motif forming a G-quadruplex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). Although in these transfection experiments TMPyP4 has not been site-directed against genomic <italic>KRAS</italic>, the formation of a G-quadruplex in a critical region of <italic>KRAS</italic> raises the intriguing possibility that this unorthodox structure is somehow involved in transcription regulation. This hypothesis is supported by the results obtained with EMSA experiments. The mouse NHPPE duplex shows three binding activities when incubated with nuclear extracts obtained from mouse NIH 3T3 cells, namely M1, M2 and M3. The single-stranded G-rich sequences of the mouse and human <italic>KRAS</italic> genes competed with the duplex probe for the binding to proteins in M1 and M2, but not in M3. The competition is observed with the quadruplex-forming wild-type sequences but not with the 4-base mutant sequences. Interestingly, when the interaction between the mouse NHPPE duplex and nuclear proteins was competed by oligonucleotides forming G-quadruplexes with conformations different from that proposed for <italic>KRAS</italic> (i.e. quadruplexes without loops or with two lateral loops) no competition activity was observed. The parallel quadruplex formed by the G-rich sequence present in the <italic>CMYC</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>) was able to compete partially with the duplex probe. These findings suggest that the interaction between proteins M1/M2 and the G-rich strand of <italic>KRAS</italic> is stereospecific and mediated by the particular quadruplex structure assumed by this sequence motif. In a previous study Michelotti <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>) have reported a zinc-dependent binding activity by the guanine-rich element of the <italic>CMYC</italic> promoter. This purine-rich strand binding protein was identified as being CNBP: a cellular nucleic acid binding protein implicated in the regulation of sterol responsive genes. One could wonder if one of proteins (M1 or M2; H1) that recognize the <italic>KRAS</italic> quadruplex is protein CNBP. This is not the case, as CNBP in a SDS&#x02013;polyacrylamide gel migrates with only one band of 20 kDa, whereas the <italic>KRAS</italic> quadruplexes show in the SDS-polyacrylamide gel two binding activities: one at 32 kDa, the other at 75 kDa. Moreover, we observed that the interaction between H1 and the <italic>KRAS</italic> quadruplex is not abrogated by EDTA, i.e. it is not Zn<sup>2+</sup>-dependent in the same way as is the interaction between the <italic>CMYC</italic> sequence and CNBP (data not shown).</p><p>Proteins binding sequence-specifically both the double-stranded and single-stranded polypyrimidine motifs have been reported as being hnRNP K (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>) and NDPK-B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>). The former recognizes a distinct sequence segment, namely CTTCC, which is present in the human (two copies) and mouse (one copy) <italic>KRAS</italic> NHPPEs. How can these nuclear factors binding to the <italic>KRAS</italic> NHPPE duplex be correlated with the G-quadruplex conformation adopted by NHPPE? In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref> we propose a scheme according to which <italic>KRAS</italic> NHPPE should exist in equilibrium between double-stranded and G-quadruplex conformations. When this structural equilibrium shifts towards the quadruplex conformation, the transcription should be repressed. This is suggested by the transfection experiments with TMPyP4 and by the results obtained with the <italic>CMYC</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>). Thus, it is possible that the quadruplex conformation behaves as negative regulator for <italic>KRAS</italic>. The unpaired polypyrimidine strand should interact with the single-stranded binding protein hnRNP K (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>). To activate transcription, NHPPE should assume its canonical double-stranded conformation, but this is possible if the polypurine strand loses its unusual structure. As the duplex-to-quadruplex transformation is probably a slow process, it could be facilitated by a protein. It is likely that one of the proteins recognising both the duplex and quadruplex forms of NHPPE is involved in the duplex-to-quadruplex interconversion. This provides a rational for the finding that 293 cells transfected with a G-rich oligonucleotide mimicking the <italic>KRAS</italic> quadruplex reduces the activity of the <italic>KRAS</italic> promoter to 40% of the control (4-base mutant sequence). In the light of these results, oligonucleotides mimicking the <italic>KRAS</italic> quadruplexes may have a potential anticancer activity, as they interfere with the expression of <italic>KRAS</italic>. This is supported by the data presented in this paper and by previous data obtained with a stable transfectant cell line generating constitutively a quadruplex-forming oligoribonucleotide that strongly impairs cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>). Another attractive target for small ligands is the <italic>KRAS</italic> NHPPE quadruplex. The selection from a chemical library of molecules that specifically bind to the <italic>KRAS</italic> G-quadruplex could be an interesting approach for the development of powerful anticancer drugs against refractory pancreatic adenocarcinomas cells.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p>Supplementary Data are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="nar_34_9_2536__index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="nar_34_9_2536__1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work has been carried out with the financial support of Ministry of Education (PRIN 2005).
