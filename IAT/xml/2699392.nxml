In contrast, M2 polarized macrophages are critical to the resolution of inflammation but neither actions of P2X<sub>7</sub>R on these macrophages nor mechanisms by which macrophages switch from pro-inflammatory to anti-inflammatory phenotypes are known. Here, we investigated extracellular ATP signalling over a dynamic macrophage polarity gradient from M1 through M2 phenotypes. In macrophages polarized towards, but not at, M2 phenotype, in which intracellular IL-1&#x003b2; remains high and the inflammasome is intact, P2X<sub>7</sub>R activation selectively uncouples to the NLRP3-inflammasome activation but not to upstream ion channel activation. In these intermediate M1/M2 polarized macrophages, extracellular ATP now acts through its pyrophosphate chains, independently of other purine receptors, to inhibit IL-1&#x003b2; release by other stimuli through two independent mechanisms: inhibition of ROS production and trapping of the inflammasome complex through intracellular clustering of actin filaments.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>alternative macrophage activation</kwd><kwd>caspase-1</kwd><kwd>inflammation</kwd><kwd>NLRP-3 inflammasome</kwd><kwd>P2X<sub>7</sub> receptor</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec disp-level="1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Macrophages are critical to both the innate and adaptive immune response; they must develop and respond to rapid changes in the microenvironment. Inflammation resulting from pathogens or tissue damage activates resident macrophages to initiate or increase production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and other inflammatory mediators. However, macrophages are equally critical in the resolution of inflammation by producing anti-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines and by increased phagocytic activity. On the basis of Th1/Th2 polarization concepts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Romagnani, 2000</xref>), phenotypically polarized macrophages are now generally termed pro-inflammatory M1 or classically activated, and anti-inflammatory M2 or alternatively activated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Gordon, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Martinez <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>). Experimentally, macrophages <italic>in vitro</italic> are polarized to the M1 state by treatment with IFN-&#x003b3; and inducers of TNF-&#x003b1;, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or other bacterial products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Ehrt <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Gordon, 2003</xref>). M1 macrophages induce synthesis and upregulation of several pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, key among these are TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-12, IL-6, CCL2 and IL-1&#x003b2;, as well as increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitrogen intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Gordon, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Martinez <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>). At the other extreme, macrophages are polarized to the M2 state by stimuli such as IL-4, IL-13, IL-10 or glucocorticoid hormones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Gordon, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Martinez <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>). M2 macrophages upregulate scavenger, mannose and galactose receptors, IL-1 receptor antagonist and downregulate IL-1&#x003b2; and other pro-inflammatory cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Gordon, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Scotton <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Martinez <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">2008</xref>). Very high levels of IL-1&#x003b2; are present in M1 polarized macrophages because of activation of the NF-&#x003ba;B and MAPK cascades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Dinarello, 1996</xref>) but no IL-1&#x003b2; protein is found in M2 polarized macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Scotton <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Martinez <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>).</p><p>IL-1&#x003b2; processing and release is a tightly regulated process involving a multiprotein complex, the capase-1 inflammasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Martinon <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>). IL-1&#x003b2; is synthesized as a 34 kD precursor protein that is cleaved to its biologically active 17 kD form by the protease caspase-1. Inactive caspase-1 is constitutively present in both M1 and M2 macrophages and is activated in M1 macrophages by self-cleavage that occurs in the inflammasome complex. Distinct caspase-1 inflammasomes have been distinguished based on their protein composition and means of activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Mariathasan <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Kanneganti <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Martinon <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). The nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat receptor containing pyrin domain 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome can be activated by specific microbial motifs (pathogen-associated molecular patterns, PAMPs), by <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> bacteria, by microbial toxins such as nigericin and maitotoxin (MTX), by uric acid crystals and by extracellular ATP acting through the ATP-gated plasma membrane ion channel, the P2X<sub>7</sub> receptor (P2X<sub>7</sub>R) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Mariathasan <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Martinon <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">P&#x000e9;trilli <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). P2X<sub>7</sub>R activation by ATP released at sites of inflammation is currently the only well-established physiological stimulator of the NLRP3 inflammasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Ferrari <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Mariathasan <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">2006</xref>) and, as such, it has become an attractive target for development of new anti-inflammatory drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Pelegrin, 2008</xref>). P2X<sub>7</sub>R gene -deleted mice show anti-inflammatory phenotypes in models of neuropathic and inflammatory pain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Labasi <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Chessell <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>) and a recently developed P2X<sub>7</sub>R antagonist has shown reduced joint swelling, tenderness and pain perception in Phase II clinical trails in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">McInnes <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). The P2X<sub>7</sub>R is a highly unusual ion channel predominantly expressed in macrophage and microglia; its activation opens a cationic channel with high permeability to calcium but it also forms within seconds a larger pore permeable to small molecules up to 900 Da (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Ferrari <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Pelegrin and Surprenant, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Pelegrin <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>). All downstream sequelae of P2X<sub>7</sub>R activation except for the initial cation channel opening require the presence of the intracellular C-terminus, which is key to the formation of the P2X<sub>7</sub>R-multiprotein complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Ferrari <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>).</p><p>This study was prompted by a surprising observation we made while comparing <italic>E. coli</italic> and P2X<sub>7</sub>R-induced activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and IL-1&#x003b2; release in M1 polarized macrophages. We found that, though <italic>E. coli</italic>-induced release of IL-1&#x003b2; remained constant, ATP-evoked IL-1&#x003b2; release ceased over time in spite of continued high levels of intracellular IL-1&#x003b2; and without decreased functional P2X<sub>7</sub>R as assayed by upstream ion channel signalling. We found that unexpected changes in the polarization state of the macrophages were causing a P2X<sub>7</sub>R-specific uncoupling to the caspase-1 cascade. We therefore developed an <italic>in vitro</italic> model of a likely macrophage polarization gradient from extreme M1 through to extreme M2 and examined the actions of different NLRP3-inflammasome activators (ATP, <italic>E. coli</italic>, MTX and nigericin) over this polarization gradient, as well as in acute and chronically P2X<sub>7</sub>R -deleted M1 polarized macrophages. This study has identified a new mechanism by which extracellular ATP produces physiological inhibition of IL-1&#x003b2; release that may be key to switching a macrophage from an inducer of inflammation towards its anti-inflammatory phenotype in the resolution phase of infection or inflammation.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Characterization of a dynamic macrophage polarity gradient</title><p>We developed an <italic>in vitro</italic> polarization protocol designed to rapidly mimic (over 4&#x02013;8 h) a continuum of signals that are likely to drive the macrophage from the classic inflammatory M1 polarity to the anti-inflammatory M2 state (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S1A</xref> available online). Macrophages from polarities close to M1 (states 1&#x02013;3) were expanded and tightly fixed to substrate, formed numerous lamellar processes and elongated filopodia, with diffuse F-actin staining throughout the cytoplasm but distinctly absent from the filopodia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). Macrophages from a polarity close to M2 (state 4) presented less lamellar processes but remained expanded and tightly fixed to the substrate, whereas the extreme M2 polarized (alternatively activated) macrophages had the same morphology as untreated cells with F-actin being tightly compacted close to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). We quantified these changes in cell morphology by measuring total surface area over all polarizations states and found a gradual progression from state 1 through state 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1C</xref>, <italic>n</italic>=50&#x02013;70 cells for each polarization state). We also confirmed that our protocols did, indeed, establish a molecular polarization gradient by quantitative RT&#x02013;PCR (qPCR) for the classical M1 and M2 genes, TNF-&#x003b1; and mannose receptor C (MRC-1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Gordon, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Martinez <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>); TNF-&#x003b1; gene expression was upregulated by 200-fold in M1 macrophages and this gradually decreased to near zero in extreme M2 macrophages, whereas MRC-1 gene expression gradually increased over the gradient to reach a 10-fold upregulation at extreme M2 polarization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>P2X<sub>7</sub>R, but not E. coli, uncouples to inflammasome activation during macrophage polarization</title><p>We found that intracellular levels of proIL-1&#x003b2; remained high in all polarization states (1&#x02013;4) except, as expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Gordon, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Martinez <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>), the alternatively activated M2 macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). ATP stimulation of P2X<sub>7</sub>R in M1 activated macrophage and <italic>E. coli</italic> infection are both well-characterized pathways known to initiate NLRP3-inflammasome-dependent release of mature IL-1&#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Ferrari <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Mariathasan <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">P&#x000e9;trilli <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). However, we found striking differences in their ability to release IL-1&#x003b2; over the polarization gradient. In agreement with numerous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Mariathasan <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Pelegrin and Surprenant, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">P&#x000e9;trilli <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>), both P2X<sub>7</sub>R and <italic>E. coli</italic> stimulation induced the release of IL-1&#x003b2; from M1 polarized macrophages but P2X<sub>7</sub>R-induced release of IL-1&#x003b2; was significantly reduced, or absent, in macrophages of intermediate polarity (states 3, 4; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). Conversely, <italic>E. coli</italic> induced significantly greater IL-1&#x003b2; release from these intermediately polarized macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2B</xref>). Moreover, we observed a similar uncoupling of P2X<sub>7</sub>R from IL-1&#x003b2; release during traditional long-term activation of macrophages with LPS/IFN-&#x003b3; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Arend <italic>et al</italic>, 1989</xref>). That is, though P2X<sub>7</sub>R or <italic>E. coli</italic>-induced release of IL-1&#x003b2; peaked at similar times (5&#x02013;10 h post activation with either LPS/IFN-&#x003b3; or <italic>E. coli</italic>), ATP failed to stimulate IL-1&#x003b2; release subsequently in spite of maintained high levels of intracellular IL-1&#x003b2; and in contrast to the continued release of IL-1&#x003b2; by <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2C</xref>). Initially, we hypothesized a decrease in P2X<sub>7</sub>R expression was the most likely explanation for the failure of ATP to stimulate IL-1&#x003b2; release under these conditions, as clearly the NLRP3-inflammasome cascade known to be activated by <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">P&#x000e9;trilli <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>) was not affected. However, we could not attribute this loss of P2X<sub>7</sub>R-mediated release of IL-1&#x003b2; to loss of functional receptors because (i) P2X<sub>7</sub>R gene expression was actually downregulated in M1 macrophages and did not change from states 1 to 3, then increased in states 4 and 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1D</xref>); (ii) P2X<sub>7</sub>R protein localization remained constant through all polarization states, in particular the P2X<sub>7</sub>R protein showed a similar punctate expression along the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2D</xref>); (iii) assays for upstream signalling of P2X<sub>7</sub>R (calcium flux and dye-uptake) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Pelegrin and Surprenant, 2006</xref>) did not change over the polarity gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2E and F</xref>). Macrophages obtained from P2X<sub>7</sub>R gene-deleted mice were subjected to the same polarization gradient protocols and served as controls; in these macrophages no anti-P2X<sub>7</sub>R antibody staining was present (data not shown) and no ATP-mediated calcium flux or dye-uptake occurred in M1 macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2E and F</xref>) or in M2 macrophages (data not shown).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>From positive to negative regulation of IL-1<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> release by ATP during macrophage polarization</title><p>We next compared inflammasome activation profiles induced by ATP and by two toxins, MTX and nigericin, which activate the NRLP3-inflammasome with similar kinetics and mechanisms to P2X<sub>7</sub>R but which are not dependent on P2X<sub>7</sub>R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Mariathasan <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Pelegrin and Surprenant, 2007</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S1B</xref>). IL-1&#x003b2; ELISA assays (which recognize pro and mature forms of the cytokine) showed that ATP-induced IL-1&#x003b2; release was reduced by 50&#x02013;80&#x00025; in state 3 intermediate polarized macrophages compared with M1 polarized cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figures 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">3A</xref>), whereas MTX-induced IL-1&#x003b2; release was the same in macrophages from either polarity state or similar to levels of ATP-induced release from M1 macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3A</xref>). When ATP and MTX were co-applied, IL-1&#x003b2; release was increased in M1 macrophages to the same extent as in the presence of either compound alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3A</xref>). However, co-application of MTX and ATP to state 3 polarized macrophages resulted in a 50&#x00025; reduction of IL-1&#x003b2; release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3A</xref>). Western blots showed typical release of mature IL-1&#x003b2; from M1 macrophage in response to ATP, MTX or a combination of MTX and ATP whereas in state 3 polarized macrophages; mature IL-1&#x003b2; was detected in response to MTX but not ATP stimulation and co-application significantly decreased release of mature IL-1&#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S2A</xref>). Strikingly, ATP completely prevented MTX-induced release of IL-1&#x003b2; in M1 polarized macrophages after acute blockade of P2X<sub>7</sub>R with the P2X<sub>7</sub>R-selective antagonist, A740003 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Honore <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S2B</xref>). ATP similarly inhibited both MTX and nigericin-induced release of IL-1&#x003b2; from M1 polarized macrophages obtained from P2X<sub>7</sub>R-deleted mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S2C</xref>). ATP also inhibited caspase-1 activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3C</xref>, lower panels) and release of the inflammasome adaptor protein, Apoptosis-associated Speck-like protein containing a C-terminal caspase-activating recruiting domain (ASC, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3D</xref>) induced by either MTX or nigericin in M1 polarized P2X<sub>7</sub>R<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> macrophages. Re-introduction of P2X<sub>7</sub>R into P2X<sub>7</sub>R<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> macrophages through adenoviral delivery reconstituted all features of ATP-mediated IL-1&#x003b2; release and caspase-1 activation from M1 polarized macrophages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S1D and E</xref>). ATP also failed to induce caspase-1 activation in M2 wild-type polarized macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3E</xref>), although upstream signalling through P2X<sub>7</sub>R (calcium flux, dye-uptake) was not significantly different than observed in M1 macrophages. Taken together, these results show that the inhibitory action of ATP on these macrophages was due solely to lack of P2X<sub>7</sub>R downstream signalling and not to alterations in the NLRP3 inflammasome itself. ATP was equally able to inhibit IL-1&#x003b2; release from the <italic>in vitro E. coli</italic> model of infection and slow NLRP3 activation (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S1C</xref>) in M1 polarized macrophages from P2X<sub>7</sub>R<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3F</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S2D</xref>). This inhibition was not because of alterations in binding or phagocytosis of the bacteria by these macrophages in the presence of ATP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S2E</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Negative regulation of IL-1<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> by ATP is not through purinoreceptors but is due to pyrophosphate actions</title><p>We expected the inhibitory actions of ATP, which occurred during macrophage polarization from M1 towards M2 states or which were revealed by acute (selective P2X<sub>7</sub>R antagonist) or chronic (P2X<sub>7</sub>R<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> macrophage) blockade of P2X<sub>7</sub>R, to result from activation of one, or more, purinergic P2X, P2Y or adenosine receptors. However, results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S3A, and E</xref> quickly ruled out involvement of any of these receptors in the inhibition of IL-1&#x003b2; release by ATP. We used M1 polarized macrophages from P2X<sub>7</sub>R<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4A&#x02013;E</xref>) or from wild-type mice in the presence of A740003 (data not shown) and examined the actions of ATP and other purines on MTX-induced IL-1&#x003b2; release and caspase-1 activation. First, the ATP concentration&#x02013;inhibition curve was 20&#x02013;100-fold to the right of all known purine and adenosine receptors except for P2X<sub>7</sub>R; indeed, the IC<sub>50</sub> value for ATP inhibition of MTX-induced IL-1&#x003b2; release in P2X<sub>7</sub>R-depleted macrophage (1.54&#x000b1;0.03 mM, <italic>n</italic>=3) was not significantly different from the ATP EC<sub>50</sub> value to induce release of IL-1&#x003b2; from wild-type M1 macrophages (1.65&#x000b1;0.02 mM, <italic>n</italic>=3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4A and E</xref>). Second, significant inhibition was observed with ATP&#x0003e;ADP&#x0226b;AMP but not with adenosine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4B and C</xref>). Third, the non-selective P2X/P2Y inhibitor, suramin and the non-selective P2X antagonist, PPADS, did not alter the inhibition by ATP of the nigericin-induced IL-1&#x003b2; in P2X<sub>7</sub>R-deficient M1 macrophages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S3A</xref>). Most directly, pyrophosphate (PPi, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4B&#x02013;E</xref>) and triphosphate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S3C</xref>) but not monophosphate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4D</xref>) inhibited IL-1&#x003b2; release and caspase-1 activation more potently than ATP, with an IC<sub>50</sub> value for PPi of 1.03&#x000b1;0.05 mM (<italic>n</italic>=3). The non-hydrolysable bisphosphonate, clodronate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S3D</xref>), exerted the same inhibition and was 3&#x02013;5-fold more potent than PPi or ATP, with an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 0.43&#x000b1;0.14 mM. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4D and E</xref>). Both PPi and clodronate were effective to inhibit MTX-mediated IL-1&#x003b2; release from wild-type M1 or M1/M2 intermediate polarized macrophages but neither inhibited ATP-mediated release from these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4F</xref>). Finally, in HEK cells heterologously expressing P2X receptors or endogenously expressing P2Y receptors, neither PPi (5 mM) nor clodronate (1 mM) alone had any effect on membrane currents (data not shown) or cytosolic calcium transients, and nor did they significantly alter the ATP-evoked responses in these cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S3E</xref>).</p><p>Clodronate and other bisphosphonates, when encapsulated in liposomes, have been a widely used mechanism to selectively destroy macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">van Rooijen and Sanders, 1994</xref>) because macrophages phagocytose the liposomes; lysosomal phospholipases break down the liposomes and the resulting free intracellular bisphosphonates initiate apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">van Rooijen and Sanders, 1997</xref>).

We noticed a striking difference in the actions of ATP on cell morphology over the M1&#x02013;M2 polarization gradient, and therefore asked whether this may be associated with their actions to inhibit inflammasome activation. We examined F-actin distribution before and 5 min after the addition of ATP (5 mM), MTX (0.2 nM) or ATP with MTX in M1 polarized wild type and P2X<sub>7</sub>R<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> macrophage, in intermediate state 3 polarized wild-type macrophage and in M1 polarized wild-type macrophage treated with A740003 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5A</xref>). ATP induced intense F-actin distribution to only one side of the cell with extensive ramifications radiating outward over the other side; MTX induced an equally intense but uniform F-actin localization around the entire cell whereas co-application produced a randomly radiating network of F-actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5A</xref>, panels i&#x02013;iv; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S4C</xref>).

Co-application of ATP and MTX to intermediate state 3 polarized macrophages produced both intracellular F-actin clustering and radiating F-actin ramifications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5A</xref>, panel viii) but co-application to P2X<sub>7</sub>R-depleted M1 macrophages produced the same pattern of intense intracellular clustering as seen with ATP alone in these macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5A</xref>, panel xii; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S4C</xref>).

In agreement with earlier studies demonstrating that actin-based cytoskeletal pathways are not directly involved with IL-1&#x003b2; processing and release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Hornung <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>), we found that CB itself did not induce IL-1&#x003b2; release nor did it alter MTX-induced release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5B and C</xref>).

To gain further insight into potential mechanisms underlying this earlier undetected involvement of the actin cytoskeleton in NLRP3-inflammasome inhibition, we used a caspase-1-specific fluorescent probe to directly identify active caspase-1 within the macrophage. No active caspase-1 was detected in unstimulated M1 polarized macrophages from P2X<sub>7</sub>R<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6A</xref>, upper panels) or P2X<sub>7</sub>R<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6B</xref>, left panel). Stimulation of M1 polarized wild-type macrophages with ATP, or P2X<sub>7</sub>R<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> macrophages with MTX, for 5 min led to robust caspase-1 activation in discrete intracellular aggregates that are likely to represent sites of active inflammasome complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6A</xref>, lower panels and B, middle panel). Several of these active caspase-1 aggregates were observed within the actin barrier at the edge of the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6A and B</xref>, arrows), suggestive of potential caspase-1/IL-1&#x003b2; release sites. ASC immunostaining of unstimulated M1 macrophages showed a uniform cytosolic distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6A</xref>, upper middle panel), whereas ASC formed clusters after ATP stimulation, many of which co-localized with active caspase-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6A</xref>, arrowheads), confirming their status as an activated inflammasome complex. However, we also observed many ASC-only and caspase-1-only aggregates on ATP stimulation, which may indicate heterogeneous subpopulations of inflammasome-like complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6A</xref>, lower middle panel). We did not observe any co-localization of active caspase-1 with the lysosomal marker, cathepsin L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6A</xref>, right panels), which is in agreement with recent studies showing that the early release of IL-&#x003b2; does not occur through lysosomal secretory pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Brough and Rothwell, 2007</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Modulation of redox signalling by ATP and PPi during macrophage polarization</title><p>We hypothesized that the inhibition of IL-1&#x003b2; processing and release by ATP and PPi that was not reversed by treatment with CB (i.e. the actin-independent inhibition) may result from reduced ROS production because P2X<sub>7</sub>R stimulation of M1 polarized macrophages is known to increase ROS production and is associated with NLRP3-inflammasome activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Dostert <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Hewinson <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S4D</xref>) and ATP, PPi and bisphosphonates may act directly or indirectly as oxygen radical scavengers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Serretti <italic>et al</italic>, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Kachur <italic>et al</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Dombrecht <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>).

MTX similarly increased ROS production from M1 polarized P2X<sub>7</sub>R<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7C and E</xref>), but MTX-induced ROS production in these cells was prevented by ATP, PPi and clodronate with IC<sub>50</sub> values not significantly different from those obtained for inhibition of IL-1&#x003b2; release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7C&#x02013;E</xref>), and similar to the ROS scavenger <italic>N</italic>-acetyl cystein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7E</xref>). Similarly, PPi and clodronate were able to block MTX-induced ROS production in M1 wild-type macrophages, but fail to block P2X7R-induced ROS production from the same cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f7">Figure 7E</xref>), this could explain the underlying mechanism for the differential activation of the inflammasome by ATP and MTX observed between M1 and intermediate polarized macorphages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figures 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">4F</xref>).

However, only recently it has begun to be appreciated that macrophages are able to reversibly and dynamically switch from one activation state to the other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Stout and Suttles, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Porcheray <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Gratchev <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). Here, we have used a polarization gradient of cytokines and endotoxin to rapidly generate a 5-stage <italic>in vitro</italic> model of macrophage polarization from M1 through M2. In states 1&#x02013;4, intracellular IL-1&#x003b2; remained high and all stimuli except ATP continued to activate the inflammasome and release IL-1&#x003b2;. In intermediate polarization states, as well as in P2X<sub>7</sub>R-deficient macrophages, ATP no longer signalled to caspase-1 activation; rather, ATP now acted through its diphosphate and/or triphosphate chains independently of any other purine receptor to block activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome by other activators. This was accomplished by two independent mechanisms: a direct reduction in ROS production and a rapid trapping of the inflammasome complex because of dramatic intracellular clustering of the actin cytoskeleton. Our results suggest this uncoupling of P2X<sub>7</sub>R from caspase-1 activation may prove to be a key trigger in the switch from a pro-inflammatory macrophage towards its alternative functions in the resolution of inflammation. Moreover, we have identified a new cellular mechanism by which the inflammasome can be inhibited through physiological alterations in the cytoskeleton.</p><p>The characteristics of P2X<sub>7</sub>R-induced release of IL-1&#x003b2; from M1 activated macrophages are well established: intracellular pro-caspase-1 is rapidly cleaved and mature IL-1&#x003b2;, as well as caspase-1 and other inflammasome components (e.g. ASC) are released within minutes (2&#x02013;10 min) after receptor stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Mariathasan <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Ferrari <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Pelegrin and Surprenant, 2006</xref>). In this study we compared these established properties of P2X<sub>7</sub>R activation in M1 macrophages with those of macrophages exposed to a gradient of M1&#x02013;M2 activation. We have focused on the intermediate polarization state (state 3) in wild-type mouse macrophages because it provides us with a representation of a macrophage on the cusp between M1 and M2 phenotypes. In state 3, intermediate polarized macrophages intracellular levels of pro-IL-1&#x003b2; were similar to M1 macrophages, and P2X<sub>7</sub>R mRNA levels, protein levels and protein localization patterns showed no clear differences from M1 macrophages. Initial upstream signalling events, which occur in the seconds to minute time scale and represent opening of the cation-permeable ion channel (calcium, sodium influx/potassium efflux) and the P2X<sub>7</sub>R-pannexin-1-associated large pore (dye-uptake) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Pelegrin and Surprenant, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">2007</xref>), were also the same as in M1 macrophages. <italic>E. coli</italic>, MTX or nigericin-induced IL-1&#x003b2; release was the same as, or significantly increased, in these macrophages but ATP-induced release and caspase-1 activation were decreased by 50&#x02013;80&#x00025; because of an uncoupling of P2X<sub>7</sub>R signalling to ROS production and caspase-1 activation. Most strikingly, when ATP was co-applied with any of these other NLRP3-inflammasome activators, caspase-1 activation and IL-1&#x003b2; release were virtually abolished. Taken together, these results suggest that a specific uncoupling of P2X<sub>7</sub>R from the downstream caspase-1 cascade was occurring in intermediate state polarized macrophages without changes in receptor activation <italic>per se</italic> or its initial ion channel/dye-uptake pore activation.</p><p>We initially supposed that such an uncoupling of P2X<sub>7</sub>R from the inflammasome allowed ATP to now has a negative action on IL-1&#x003b2; release induced by other stimuli through one, or more, other purine receptor. However, we found that ATP blocked <italic>E. coli</italic>, MTX and nigericin-induced caspase-1 activation and IL-1&#x003b2; release in these macrophages by an action that did not involve other purine or adenosine receptors. This is a valid conclusion because agonist profiles did not correspond to any of these receptors; generic P2X and P2Y antagonists (suramin and PPADS) did not alter the inhibition by ATP observed in P2X<sub>7</sub>R-deficient macrophages and, unequivocally, because pyrophosphates (tri and di, but not mono, phosphates) as well as the non-hydrolysable bisphosphonate, clodronate, inhibited caspase-1 activation and IL-1&#x003b2; with potency order of clodronate&#x0003e;triphosphate&#x02248;diphosphate&#x0003e;ATP&#x0226b;ADP, suggesting that the diphosphate group resident in ADP could partially block inflammasome without involvement of PPi metabolism. It is tempting to speculate that ecto-nucleotidases may play a critical role in the switch of a macrophage from an M1 to an M2 state during inflammatory resolution but future studies of expression levels and activities of the large family of these molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Zimmermann, 2000</xref>) are likely to provide insight into whether specific ecto-nucleotidases may have a critical function in the switch of a macrophage from an M1 to an M2 state during inflammatory resolution. In any event, our results show that when P2X<sub>7</sub>Rs are fully functional, that is when they couple to inflammasome activation in M1 macrophages, the actions of ATP are solely stimulatory on IL-1&#x003b2; release. That is, neither PPi nor clodronate inhibited ATP-mediated IL-&#x003b2; release from M1 macrophages nor even from state 3 intermediate polarized macrophages in which the P2X<sub>7</sub>R-specific IL-1&#x003b2; release was still present although at a much reduced level, while they effectively blocked MTX- and <italic>E. coli</italic>-induced inflammasome activation. These results further support our suggestion that a specific uncoupling of otherwise functional P2X<sub>7</sub>Rs from the caspase-1 cascade is the key event in the switch of ATP from inducing (through P2X<sub>7</sub>R) to inhibiting (through PPP/PPi) IL-1&#x003b2; release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Figure 8</xref>). Recent pharmacological studies have shown that ROS production in M1 macrophages is a critical step for activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in response to ATP, toxins or crystals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Dostert <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Hewinson <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>) and P2X<sub>7</sub>R activation recruits to the plasma membrane and activates NADPH oxidase complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Hewinson <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>). However, a recent study has not found genetic support for the role of ROS in NLRP3-inflammasome activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Hornung <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>). Here, we found that in M2 macrophages P2X<sub>7</sub>R activation induces only a weak ROS response that may be owing to a specific uncoupling from recruitment of the NADPH oxidase complex without alterations in P2X<sub>7</sub>R up-stream signalling, correlating with the low level of NLRP3 activation and IL-1&#x003b2; release found in intermediate polarized macrophages after ATP/P2X<sub>7</sub>R stimulation.</p><p>By imaging individual macrophages using a caspase-1-specific fluorescent probe and co-labelling for actin or ASC as an integral component in the inflammasome complex, we found that P2X<sub>7</sub>R activation in M1 macrophages not only induced rapid actin cytoskeletal rearrangements along a spatial gradient but also rapid formation of active caspase-1/ASC aggregates, which we interpret as likely sites of functionally active inflammasomes. Several of these aggregates tightly abutted the external surface of actin filaments outlining the plasma membrane, suggesting potential sites of release. In striking contrast, ATP applied to P2X<sub>7</sub>R-depleted M1 macrophages, or to state 3 intermediate polarized macrophages, produced a rapid and intense intracellular clustering of actin filaments. A similar pattern of intracellular clustering of actin was observed when ATP, pyrophosphate or clodronate were co-applied with MTX to these macrophages with little or no activated caspase-1 fluorescence signals. Cytochalasin B blocked this intracellular aggregation of actin and reversed by 30&#x02013;50&#x00025; the inhibition of release observed in the presence of MTX plus ATP or pyrophosphate. Thus, we have identified intracellular clustering of actin filaments as a novel mechanism for inhibition of inflammasome activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><p>This study has direct and immediate clinical and physiological relevance. Clodronate and other bisphosphonates have been in clinical use for decades, primarily for the treatment of osteoarthritis and other inflammatory or metastatic bone diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Maksymowych, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Russell <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>). Their primary mechanism of action is generally considered to be one of effective chelation of calcium crystal deposits on bone mineral surfaces, resulting in inhibition of osteoclast apoptosis and bone resorption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Russell <italic>et al</italic>, 2008</xref>). Conversely, several studies have provided evidence that they may also exert an anti-inflammatory action in bone and immune cells independent of their calcium chelation properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Pennanen <italic>et al</italic>, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Maksymowych, 2002</xref>). The pyrophosphate actions to inhibit IL-1&#x003b2; release identified in this study may underlie these anti-inflammatory actions of bisphosphonates. A novel, highly selective and potent P2X<sub>7</sub>R antagonist, AZ9056, is currently in clinical trials for rheumatoid arthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">McInnes <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). Studies to date point to the primary mechanism of action of such P2X<sub>7</sub>R antagonists as being through inhibition of IL-1&#x003b2; release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Labasi <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Pelegrin, 2008</xref>). Our present work continues to support this conclusion but now raises the possibility that a secondary effect of P2X<sub>7</sub>R inhibition is to further inhibit IL-1&#x003b2; release evoked by other activators by allowing pyrophosphates&#x02014;either through extracellular ATP metabolism or directly through the phosphate chains of the intact nucleotides&#x02014;to directly prevent inflammasome activation by other bacterial or endogenous inflammatory mediators through inhibition of ROS production and by intracellular trapping of the inflammasome complex. Clinical investigations into the potential of co-therapy with P2X<sub>7</sub>R antagonists and bisphosphonates in chronic inflammatory diseases may prove fruitful.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Cells and reagents</title><p>Key reagents and their sources: <italic>E. coli</italic> LPS O55:B5, ATP, ADP, AMP, adenosine, PPi, triphosphates, <italic>N</italic>-acetyl cystein, &#x003b1;-tocopherol, nigericin (Sigma); MTX (Alexis); clodronate, caspase-1 substrate (<italic>N</italic><sup>a</sup>-5-tetramethylrhodaminyl-YVADAC(<italic>S</italic>-acrylodan)-OH), cytochalasin B (Calbiochem); IFN-&#x003b3;, IL-4 and IL-1&#x003b2; (PeproTech). <italic>E. coli</italic> DH5&#x003b1; strain, DAPI, phalloidin-Texas Red and OxyBURST H<sub>2</sub>HFF-BSA (Invitrogen).

In M1 polarized macrophages ATP acting through P2X<sub>7</sub>R is linked with an increase production of ROS, actin polymerization to the edge of the cell, activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome/caspase-1 and rapid release of the pro-inflammatory mature IL-1&#x003b2; cytokine. However, during the resolving phase of the inflammation M1 macrophages switch their phenotype towards M2 and now P2X<sub>7</sub>R uncouples to both ROS production and the NLRP3-inflammasome/caspase-1 pathway although it remains functional in terms of its ion channel activity. Under these conditions (intermediate state 3) the PPi group of ATP acts to further inhibit ROS and induces an intracellular clustering of actin that blocks the inflammasome/activation of caspase-1 and the release of mature IL-1&#x003b2; to enhance the resolving phase of the inflammation. The PPi may result from ATP metabolism by ecto-nucleotidases or may act by phosphate chains remaining attached to the nucleotide molecule.</p></caption><graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="emboj2009163f8"/></fig></floats-wrap></article>
