The IGF-IR mRNA contains an extraordinarily long (1038 nt) 5&#x02032;-untranslated region (5&#x02032;-UTR), and we have characterized a diverse series of proteins interacting with this RNA sequence which may provide for intricate regulation of IGF-IR gene expression at the translational level. Here, we report the purification and identification of one of these IGF-IR 5&#x02032;-UTR-binding proteins as HuR, using a novel RNA crosslinking/RNase elution strategy. Because HuR has been predominantly characterized as a 3&#x02032;-UTR-binding protein, enhancing mRNA stability and generally increasing gene expression, we sought to determine whether HuR might serve a different function in the context of its binding the IGF-IR 5&#x02032;-UTR. We found that HuR consistently repressed translation initiation through the IGF-IR 5&#x02032;-UTR. The inhibition of translation by HuR was concentration dependent, and could be reversed <italic>in trans</italic> by addition of a fragment of the IGF-IR 5&#x02032;-UTR containing the HuR binding sites as a specific competitor, or abrogated by deletion of the third RNA recognition motif of HuR. We determined that HuR repressed translation initiation through the IGF-IR 5&#x02032;-UTR in cells as well, and that siRNA knockdown of HuR markedly increased IGF-IR protein levels. Interestingly, we also found that HuR potently inhibited IGF-IR translation mediated through internal ribosome entry. Kinetic assays were performed to investigate the mechanism of translation repression by HuR and the dynamic interplay between HuR and the translation apparatus. We found that HuR, occupying a cap-distal position, significantly delayed translation initiation mediated by cap-dependent scanning, but was eventually displaced from its binding site, directly or indirectly, as a consequence of ribosomal scanning. However, HuR perpetually blocked the activity of the IGF-IR IRES, apparently arresting the IRES-associated translation pre-initiation complex in an inactive state. This function of HuR as a 5&#x02032;-UTR-binding protein and dual-purpose translation repressor may be critical for the precise regulation of IGF-IR expression essential to normal cellular homeostasis.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The type I insulin-like growth factor receptor (IGF-IR) is expressed on the surface of essentially all proliferating cells, where it mediates the autocrine and paracrine activities of IGF-I and IGF-II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>). Signaling through the IGF-IR is critical to the physiological regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>), and may also be central to the regulation of mammalian lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>). However, IGF-IR has also been shown to facilitate establishment and maintenance of the transformed phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>), and to exert a potent anti-apoptotic effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>), which may contribute to the molecular pathogenesis of tumors in which IGF-IR is overexpressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>). Therefore, precise regulation of IGF-IR expression is crucial for maintenance of normal cellular homeostasis, and this may require that IGF-IR expression be regulated at multiple levels.</p><p>A series of extensive investigations have established the importance of transcriptional regulation for the control of IGF-IR expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>). As an example, wild-type p53 has been shown to suppress IGF-IR promoter activity, while mutant p53 has been found to up-regulate IGF-IR mRNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). However, several lines of evidence have begun to suggest that post-transcriptional mechanisms may also be important for regulation of IGF-IR expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>). Cooke and Casella (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>) provided the first specific evidence that translation of the IGF-IR mRNA could be regulated through its extraordinarily long (1038 nt) 5&#x02032;-untranslated region (5&#x02032;-UTR). More recently, IGF-IR was identified by microarray analysis as one of a group of candidate genes that might be regulated at the translational level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>).</p><p>Complex 5&#x02032;-untranslated RNA sequences such as that associated with the IGF-IR mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>) are rare in the human genome, generally reserved for the transcripts of genes critically involved in the control of cellular proliferation and survival (e.g. transcription factors, cytokines, growth factors and their receptors) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>). These complex 5&#x02032;-UTR RNA sequences tend to adopt higher-ordered structures, which may dramatically influence translation efficiency. In addition to the structural features of the 5&#x02032;-UTR RNA itself, non-canonical translation factors that interact with specific 5&#x02032;-UTR RNA sequences are increasingly being recognized as important participants in translational regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>). These RNA-binding proteins can influence RNA secondary structure as well as the binding of other regulatory proteins to the RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>), and the position of the protein binding site within the 5&#x02032;-UTR may determine the manner in which it influences translation efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>).</p><p>We have begun to investigate the mechanisms of translational regulation through the complex IGF-IR 5&#x02032;-UTR. We recently reported the detection and characterization of a diverse series of proteins interacting specifically with the human IGF-IR 5&#x02032;-UTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>). We proposed that the dynamic interplay between RNA structure and regulatory protein binding would be important in determining the functional state of the IGF-IR mRNA. Here, we report the purification and identification of one of these IGF-IR 5&#x02032;-UTR RNA-binding proteins as HuR. HuR has been extensively characterized as a factor which enhances mRNA stability through binding to consensus AU-rich elements (ARE) in 3&#x02032;-UTR sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>); however, a few recent reports have attributed HuR with the capability of either positively or negatively influencing translational efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>). We present both <italic>in vitro</italic> and intracellular data to show that HuR functions as a translational repressor through interaction with its target sites within the IGF-IR 5&#x02032;-UTR. We demonstrate that HuR inhibits both cap-dependent and internal ribosome entry site (IRES)-mediated translation initiation, but that these two mechanisms of translation repression are kinetically distinguishable. Our results indicate that HuR may play a very important role in the regulation of IGF-IR expression at the translational level.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plasmids</title><p>The firefly luciferase coding sequence was amplified by PCR from plasmid pGL3 (Promega) using primers Luc-A-Bgl II (5&#x02032;-CTG <bold>AGA TCT</bold> ACC ATG GAA GAC GCC AAA-3&#x02032;) and Luc-B (5&#x02032;-GAA TTA CAC GGC GAT CTT TC-3&#x02032;).

Reporter RNAs were synthesized using the RiboMAX System (Promega). Briefly, in each 20 &#x003bc;l reaction, 2 &#x003bc;g DNA template was transcribed by T7 polymerase in the presence of 7.5 mM UTP, CTP, ATP and GTP. Capped RNA transcripts were synthesized in the presence of 2 mM cap analog (m<sup>7</sup>GpppG) and 1 mM GTP. After 4 h incubation at 37&#x000b0;C, the reaction was stopped by adding 2 U of RNase-free DNase I for 30 min at 37&#x000b0;C. The RNA was purified by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation with 300 mM sodium acetate at &#x02212;70&#x000b0;C overnight. RNA concentration was measured by conventional UV spectrometric analysis and agarose gel electrophoresis.</p></sec><sec><title>RNA crosslinking/RNase elution affinity purification</title><p>Synthesis of the biotin- and [&#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P]UTP-labeled intact 1038 nt IGF-IR 5&#x02032;-UTR RNA sequence was accomplished by <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription as described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>), except that biotin-14-CTP was used in a 1:1 ratio with CTP (0.25 mM each) (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> for titration of the optimal degree of biotin incorporation), unlabeled UTP was increased to 100 &#x003bc;M, the incubation continued for a 4 h period and RNase inhibitor was omitted. Following synthesis, the double-labeled RNA was purified by dilution and filtration twice (Centricon, 100 kDa molecular weight cutoff). The double-labeled RNA was then incubated with HeLa nuclear extract and crosslinking was performed as previously described for qualitative assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>), except that RNase digestion was omitted.</p><p>Briefly, HeLa nuclear extract was preincubated with 2% 2-mercaptoethanol at room temperature for 10 min. The pretreated extract was then added to reaction buffer [final concentration&#x02014;40 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 60 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM spermidine, supplemented with 0.75 mM ATP, 0.75 mM GTP, 0.05% NP-40, non-specific competitors 0.1 &#x003bc;g/&#x003bc;l poly d(I&#x02013;C) and 1 &#x003bc;g/&#x003bc;l tRNA] and incubated at room temperature for 10 min. The double-labeled RNA was then added to the reaction, and this incubation continued for 25 min at room temperature to allow for the formation of specific RNA&#x02013;protein complexes. Subsequently, 5 mg/ml heparin was added to the reaction (10 min, room temperature) to eliminate weak or unstable RNA&#x02013;protein interactions, after which the samples were irradiated (254 nm, 10 cm distance from source, Stratalinker, Model 1800) on ice for 25 min.</p><p>Then, the biotin- and radio-labeled 5&#x02032;-UTR with protein crosslinked was incubated with streptavidin&#x02013;agarose beads to immobilize the RNA. The streptavidin&#x02013;agarose beads (Life Technologies) had been pre-equilibrated with RNA binding buffer (50 vol; 40 mM Tris pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, 80 mM KCl, 6% glycerol, 0.05% NP-40, 100 mM 2-mercaptoethanol) and blocked with blocking buffer (5 vol; binding buffer plus 0.25 mg/ml tRNA, 500 &#x003bc;g/ml BSA) before loading of the RNA&#x02013;protein complexes. The efficiency of RNA&#x02013;protein complex binding to streptavidin&#x02013;agarose beads was determined by monitoring <sup>32</sup>P radioactivity in the flowthrough. We found that &#x0223c;90% of the RNA&#x02013;protein complex was bound to the beads after 30 min gentle rocking in a 2 ml polypropylene microfuge tube at room temperature.</p><p>Because the protein was covalently crosslinked to the RNA, and the streptavidin&#x02013;biotin linkage is highly stable, it was possible to use a washing protocol of extremely high stringency. The beads were pelleted by centrifugation for 3 min in a microfuge at low speed, and washed sequentially in 50 vol binding buffer (=washing buffer 1), 15 vol washing buffer 2 (binding buffer without KCl, plus 2% SDS), 15 vol pre-binding buffer (binding buffer without KCl, to remove detergent), 15 vol washing buffer 3 (binding buffer with 1M KCl), and 15 vol binding buffer (to remove high salt). Finally, specific elution of bound RNA&#x02013;protein complex was achieved under otherwise low-stringency conditions by the addition of 5 vol elution buffer [binding buffer plus 4 &#x003bc;g RNase A (Ambion, affinity purified)]. The eluted protein&#x02013;oligoribonucleotide complex was concentrated to 50 &#x003bc;l by microfiltration through a 5% Tween-20 passivated Microcon YM-3 microfilter (Millipore). The purified protein, still attached to a small remnant of radiolabeled RNA, was resolved by 10% SDS&#x02013;PAGE and detected by autoradiography.</p><p>Because the protein&#x02013;oligoribonucleotide complex was radiolabeled, it was possible to readily follow the progress and evaluate the efficiency of recovery at each step, even on small and medium-scale purification trials, performed using reaction volumes between 8 and 800 &#x003bc;l and total protein of 20 ug to 2 mg. For large scale purification, the reaction was scaled up as much as 800-fold, RNA excess was ensured and its specific activity was reduced to minimize radiolysis, utilizing as much as &#x0223c;200 pmol total double-labeled RNA and &#x0223c;16 mg total HeLa nuclear extract in an 8 ml crosslinking reaction, loaded onto 200 &#x003bc;l streptavidin&#x02013;agarose beads. Detection and excision of the RNA-binding proteins from the SDS&#x02013;PAGE gel were performed by aligning the autoradiographic film with the gel (without any staining). Using this strategy, starting with a relatively small amount of crude nuclear extract, we were able to enrich for even a minor component in the crosslinking/label transfer reaction to a degree sufficient for positive identification by tandem mass spectrometry.</p></sec><sec><title>Protein isolation and tandem mass spectrometry analysis</title><p>The band representing the 38 kDa RNA binding protein eluted from the RNA affinity matrix, and a control, which was excised from an adjacent control lane, were subjected to <italic>de novo</italic> peptide sequence analysis by Dr William S.

In our quest to identify the IGF-IR 5&#x02032;-UTR binding proteins, we adapted some of the features of the crosslinking/label transfer procedure to develop a new protocol for affinity purification of these proteins from crude cellular extract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). The essential features of this strategy involve covalent crosslinking of the RNA-binding protein to its target RNA sequence (in the presence of nonspecific competitor nucleic acids and heparin), an extremely high-stringency washing protocol (including 2% SDS followed by 1 M KCl) and specific elution under otherwise low-stringency conditions through enzymatic digestion of the matrix-bound RNA.</p><p>A very high degree of enrichment for the RNA-binding proteins from crude nuclear extract is evident in a silver-stained gel of the various fractions resulting from a medium-scale purification trial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Although some loss in the flowthrough and initial low-stringency wash was noted, it was possible to recover a considerable proportion of the specifically crosslinked 38 and 42 kDa proteins in the final elution step (autoradiograph, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Because detection of the protein depended on covalent attachment to a radiolabeled remnant of its RNA target sequence, this ensured that the band excised from the SDS&#x02013;PAGE gel was in fact the RNA-binding protein of interest, and made it possible to avoid the decrement in quality of mass spectrometric data associated with silver staining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Tentative identification of the 38 kDa IGF-IR 5&#x02032;-UTR-binding protein as HuR</title><p>The results of tandem mass spectrometry performed on the 38 kDa band isolated using the RNA crosslinking/RNase elution protocol yielded four different peptide sequences (21% sequence coverage, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>) which matched the human protein HuR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>). HuR (also known as HuA) is one of four members of the human Hu protein family, which are highly homologous to the <italic>Drosophila</italic> ELAV (embryonic lethal abnormal vision) proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>). Whereas the other three family members, HuB, HuC and HuD, are specifically expressed in neural tissues, HuR is expressed ubiquitously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>). HuR contains three RNA recognition motifs (RRMs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>) and a hinge region between RRM2 and RRM3 which has been characterized as the HuR nuclear&#x02013;cytoplasmic shuttling sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Confirmation that the 38 kDa protein binding to the IGF-IR 5&#x02032;-UTR is HuR</title><p>Three independent methods were employed to confirm that the 38 kDa protein, which we have previously characterized as binding to the IGF-IR 5&#x02032;-UTR, is in fact HuR. First, we showed that the 38 kDa band produced by UV crosslinking of cellular protein to the IGF-IR 5&#x02032;-UTR could be specifically immunoprecipitated by a monoclonal antibody to HuR, but not by an isotype-matched irrelevant control antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and data not shown). We found that the efficiency of immunoprecipitation of the 38 kDa crosslinked RNA&#x02013;protein complex actually increased slightly in the presence of the detergent Empigen BB, which selectively disrupts physiological protein&#x02013;protein interactions without disturbing high-affinity antibody&#x02013;antigen interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>). Thus this result confirms the direct interaction of HuR with the IGF-IR 5&#x02032;-UTR RNA.</p><p>Next we examined the capacity of purified recombinant GST-HuR to bind specifically to the IGF-IR 5&#x02032;-UTR RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). GST-HuR (62 kDa) interacts directly with the IGF-IR 5&#x02032;-UTR sequence while recombinant GST alone does not. This result, performed in the absence of other eukaryotic proteins, also indicates that HuR is capable of binding to the IGF-IR 5&#x02032;-UTR independently of any putative auxiliary factors.</p><p>We also used a series of 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; deletions of the IGF-IR 5&#x02032;-UTR RNA to map the binding sites for recombinant GST-HuR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Recombinant HuR exhibited precisely the same mapping characteristics as the cellular 38 kDa RNA-binding protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>), with its binding sites localized to the 3&#x02032;-most 149 nt of the 5&#x02032;-UTR (890&#x02013;1038). Within this region, two short U-rich sequences and one long polypyrimidine tract have been identified as candidate HuR binding sites.</p><p>We also developed a new method, which we have designated the western-shift assay, to demonstrate the binding of cellular HuR to the IGF-IR 5&#x02032;-UTR. Crosslinking of a specific cellular RNA-binding protein to its target sequence, followed by RNase T<sub>1</sub> digestion (which cleaves after unpaired G residues), will leave a residual oligoribonucleotide covalently attached to the RNA-binding protein. This will result in an effective shift of the molecular weight of the RNA-binding protein attributable to the remnant of the target RNA, which should be detectable by western blot analysis. Indeed, native HuR bands shifted by covalent attachment to remnants of the IGF-IR 5&#x02032;-UTR were observed [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, compare lane 3 (with no crosslinking) to lane 4], and the intensities of the shifted bands progressively increased with increasing input of the IGF-IR 5&#x02032;-UTR RNA (lanes 5&#x02013;8). If the crosslinked RNA&#x02013;protein complex was further digested by RNase A (which cleaves after pyrimidines), the size of the residual crosslinked oligoribonucleotide and thus the relative shift of molecular weight was dramatically reduced (lanes 1 and 2).</p><p>There were at least three advantages of the western-shift assay for confirmation of the identity of a specific RNA-binding protein which are worthy of mention. First, this technique does not require the use of recombinant proteins, which in many cases have been observed to lose their RNA-binding activity or specificity <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>). Second, no immunoprecipitation-competent antibody was required. Finally, the western-shift assay allows direct quantitative assessment of the binding capacity of a cellular protein to a specific RNA molecule, which is not possible with standard crosslinking/label transfer experiments, in which neither the unbound RNA nor the unbound protein is visualized.</p><p>Together these results provide confirmation that the 38 kDa IGF-IR 5&#x02032;-UTR-binding protein is HuR.</p></sec><sec><title>HuR inhibits translation through the IGF-IR 5&#x02032;-UTR <italic>in vitro</italic></title><p>We had hypothesized that the proteins binding the complex 5&#x02032;-UTR of the IGF-IR transcript would contribute to the regulation of IGF-IR expression at the translational level. To examine the effect of HuR on IGF-IR translation, we first performed an <italic>in vitro</italic> co-translation assay, in which the RNA encoding HuR and the reporter RNA containing the full length IGF-IR 5&#x02032;-UTR (positioned upstream of the firefly luciferase coding sequence) were incubated together in RRL. Inclusion of the HuR RNA specifically decreased translation of the reporter RNA containing the IGF-IR 5&#x02032;-UTR in a concentration-dependent manner, whereas the HuR RNA had no effect on the translation of a control reporter RNA with no IGF-IR 5&#x02032;-UTR sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). To demonstrate the inhibitory effect of HuR on IGF-IR translation more directly, we next added <italic>in vitro</italic> translated HuR protein directly to the <italic>in vitro</italic> translation assay. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, the recombinant untagged HuR protein specifically inhibited translation of the IGF-IR 5&#x02032;-UTR reporter RNA in a similar manner as observed in the co-translation assay. These results indicate that HuR is capable of negatively influencing translation efficiency <italic>in vitro</italic> through the IGF-IR 5&#x02032;-UTR.</p><p>To further establish the sequence-specificity of translational repression by HuR, we used an isolated 149 nt fragment of the IGF-IR 5&#x02032;-UTR (nt 890&#x02013;1038), which encompasses the HuR binding sites, as a specific competitor for HuR in the <italic>in vitro</italic> translation assay. With increasing amount of the competitor RNA added, the inhibitory effect of HuR on translation through the IGF-IR 5&#x02032;-UTR was progressively diminished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). However, a similarly sized fragment of the IGF-IR 5&#x02032;-UTR (nt 1&#x02013;205), which does not bind HuR, had no such effect.</p><p>The negative effect of HuR on translation through the IGF-IR 5&#x02032;-UTR could conceivably be caused by decreased stability of these reporter RNAs (although in the literature, HuR has consistently been associated with stabilization rather than destabilization of RNA). To rule out this possibility, an <italic>in vitro</italic> re-translation assay was performed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref>). As depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, the IGF-IR 5&#x02032;-UTR reporter RNA was subjected to a first round of translation in the presence or absence of HuR protein, and then was extracted and re-translated. If HuR had decreased the reporter RNA stability, we would expect to detect a difference in the second round of translation. The result clearly indicated that these two populations of RNA still have exactly the same ability to be translated. Taken together, these results demonstrate that HuR specifically inhibits translation <italic>in vitro</italic> through specific interaction with its target sequences within the IGF-IR 5&#x02032;-UTR, without permanently altering the translatability of the RNA.</p></sec><sec><title>RRM3 is necessary for HuR translational repression</title><p>Next, we sought to delineate the structural domains of HuR responsible for translational repression. Four C-terminal truncation mutants of HuR were generated by <italic>in vitro</italic> translation, and the effects of each of these proteins on translation initiation through the IGF-IR 5&#x02032;-UTR were measured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Interestingly, deletion of just the C-terminal 82 amino acids (RRM3) of HuR caused a dramatic reduction in translational repression, relative to the wild-type protein generated in the same manner (panel A). Further deletion of the nuclear&#x02013;cytoplasmic shuttling sequence, or all or part of RRM2, had no further influence on HuR translation-regulatory function. Under conditions in which cap-dependent scanning is inhibited and only IRES-mediated translation initiation is measured (discussed extensively below), deletion of RRM3 completely abrogated HuR translational repression (panel B). Crosslinking analysis reveals a total loss of binding of HuR to the IGF-IR 5&#x02032;-UTR upon deletion of RRM3 (panels C and D).</p><p>Taken together, these results indicate that RRM3 is critical for high-affinity sequence-specific binding to the IGF-IR 5&#x02032;-UTR, and absolutely necessary for repression of IRES-mediated translation. The minimal residual translational repression observed with HuR RRM1 alone may be due to a low-affinity interaction with the IGF-IR 5&#x02032;-UTR RNA (undetectable under the high-stringency conditions used for crosslinking).</p></sec><sec><title>HuR specifically inhibits translation through the IGF-IR 5&#x02032;-UTR in cells</title><p>To determine whether HuR can function as a translation repressor in the intact cell, the IGF-IR reporter construct pIGFIR(890&#x02013;1038)-FLuc and the expression plasmid for untagged HuR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>) were transiently co-transfected into the OVCAR3 cell line. HuR specifically inhibited translation of the reporter containing the HuR binding sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) but had no effect on translation of the reporter pIGFIR(1&#x02013;209)-FLuc, which contains a similarly sized fragment of the IGF-IR 5&#x02032;-UTR that does not bind HuR. Also, no such inhibitory effect was observed if an expression plasmid encoding a control RNA-binding protein, hnRNP C, was co-transfected with the IGF-IR 5&#x02032;-UTR reporter. Importantly, the inhibitory effect of HuR on reporter expression was not accompanied by a concomitant decrease of the mRNA level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), confirming that the specific repression of gene expression by HuR through the IGF-IR 5&#x02032;-UTR in cells occurs at the translational level.</p></sec><sec><title>HuR inhibits IGF-IR IRES-mediated translation</title><p>Recently, it has been reported that the rat IGF-IR 5&#x02032;-UTR, which is 85% homologous to the human sequence, contains an IRES (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref>). We have now determined that the human IGF-IR 5&#x02032;-UTR also contains a functional IRES (Z. Meng, C. Badorff, P. D. Emanuel and S. W. Blume, manuscript in preparation). The bi-cistronic dual-luciferase reporter used to measure IRES activity was also used to test whether HuR could inhibit translation mediated through the human IGF-IR IRES. In the dual-luciferase reporter, the <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase (first cistron) will be translated in a cap-dependent manner, whereas the firefly luciferase (second cistron), which is preceded by the human IGF-IR 5&#x02032;-UTR sequence, will be translated through internal ribosome entry. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, HuR significantly inhibited translation mediated by the IGF-IR IRES in a concentration-dependent manner in cells, whereas the control protein hnRNP C had no such effect.</p></sec><sec><title>HuR knockdown increases IGF-IR levels <italic>in vivo</italic></title><p>The results described above, utilizing <italic>in vitro</italic> and intracellular reporter assays, demonstrate that recombinant HuR functions as a potent repressor of translation initiation mediated through the IGF-IR 5&#x02032;-UTR. To confirm a similar functional relationship between endogenous HuR and endogenous IGF-IR in cells, siRNA knockdown experiments targeted to HuR were performed. Transfection of HuR siRNA into OVCAR3 cells resulted in a dramatic decrease in HuR levels, accompanied by a significant increase in IGF-IR levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). The control siRNA targeted to EGFP had no significant effect on either HuR or IGF-IR levels. These results provide substantial evidence that HuR indeed serves as a physiological regulator of IGF-IR expression <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Establishment of a quantitative <italic>in vitro</italic> system to investigate the mechanism of translational repression by HuR</title><p>Since IGF-IR translation through its complex 5&#x02032;-UTR can be initiated by either the cap-dependent or IRES-mediated pathway, we speculated that HuR might utilize different mechanisms to repress each pathway. To this end, we elected to perform an additional series of <italic>in vitro</italic> translation experiments specifically designed to study the mechanism(s) of translation repression by HuR, focusing on the 149 nt fragment (890&#x02013;1038) at the 3&#x02032; end of the IGF-IR 5&#x02032;-UTR. This fragment contains all of the high-affinity HuR binding sites, and these are all located more than 55 nt away from the 5&#x02032; end of the RNA (owing in part to the presence of a 42 nt leader generated from the vector sequence). Thus this RNA template maintains the cap-distal nature of the HuR binding sites seen in the intact 5&#x02032;-UTR. Importantly, we have determined that the IGF-IR internal ribosome entry window is also contained within this fragment, and that this sequence can mediate cap-independent translation initiation relatively efficiently <italic>in vitro</italic>, while the full length IGF-IR 5&#x02032;-UTR does not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). Therefore, the IGFIR(890&#x02013;1038)-FLuc reporter RNA successfully recapitulates both the cap-dependent and IRES-mediated translation-initiation features associated with the intact IGF-IR 5&#x02032;-UTR in cells.</p><p>For this series of <italic>in vitro</italic> translation experiments, we utilized purified recombinant GST-HuR (instead of <italic>in vitro</italic> translated HuR) to facilitate quantitative functional assessment of HuR&#x02013;RNA interactions, and capped <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase RNA was included in all <italic>in vitro</italic> translation reactions as an internal control. UV crosslinking data confirmed that GST-HuR does specifically bind the IGFIR(890&#x02013;1038)-FLuc reporter RNA, but does not interact with either the control firefly or <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). A sequence-specific and concentration-dependent repression of translation through the 890&#x02013;1038 fragment of the IGFIR 5&#x02032;-UTR by GST-HuR was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>), similar to that seen with the full-length IGF-IR 5&#x02032;-UTR reporter RNA and <italic>in vitro</italic> translated untagged HuR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Labile repression of cap-dependent translation by HuR</title><p>Because the HuR binding sites are positioned upstream of the initiation codon, the translation pre-initiation complex will unavoidably encounter HuR as it linearly scans the 5&#x02032; leader sequence. Therefore we speculated that HuR might initially block the progress of the scanning 43S translation pre-initiation complex, but eventually be displaced from its binding sites, resulting in a variability in translational repression over time. As an initial test of this hypothesis, we compared the degree of translation repression by HuR at two time points (10 and 90 min) over a range of HuR concentrations. Consistent with our speculation, we found that the degree of translation repression by HuR changed with time, with a considerably greater degree of repression observed at the earlier time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>).</p><p>These results prompted us to perform a more detailed examination of the kinetics of translational repression by HuR. Translation of the reporter RNA in the presence or absence of HuR was monitored at multiple time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>). HuR did not significantly alter synthesis of the internal control <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase. However, HuR dramatically delayed the translation of the IGFIR(890&#x02013;1038)-FLuc reporter RNA. A closer inspection of the data revealed that HuR exerts the greatest translation repression at the earliest time points (initially 35-fold repression), decreasing over a relatively short period of time (to 7-fold at 20 min), and reaching a plateau (at &#x0223c;4&#x02013;5-fold) thereafter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref>). This residual translational repression by HuR through the IGF-IR 5&#x02032;-UTR sequence persisted for at least 90 min.</p><p>We were concerned that analysis of cumulative luciferase activities may not accurately discriminate changes in the instantaneous degree of translation repression by HuR, especially at later time points. For example, the apparent late plateau of translational repression observed might have been produced solely by the initial repression by HuR at the early time points. Therefore, we re-analyzed this data to assess the relative rate of translation (velocity) rather than cumulative protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10D</xref>). The lower rate of translation observed in the presence of HuR is manifested in the vertical distances between the two plots (double-headed arrows). Note that there is initially nearly a two log difference in translation velocity of the IGFIR 5&#x02032;-UTR reporter RNA with and without HuR. This difference (repression) narrows to less than one log over a short period of time. Importantly, the rate of translation in the presence of HuR never attained the level observed in the absence of HuR.</p><p>From these results, there appear to be two phases of translational repression by HuR&#x02014;an initial phase during which HuR repression is extremely efficient but labile, followed by a secondary phase of lower but relatively constant repression of translational efficiency.</p></sec><sec><title>Persistent and potent repression of IRES-mediated translation by HuR</title><p>It is important to recognize that the results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref> reflect a combination of cap-dependent and IRES-mediated translation. The appearance of two phases of HuR translational repression may be indicative of two different mechanisms by which HuR represses translation initiation through the IGF-IR 5&#x02032;-UTR. In particular, we speculated that HuR might directly interfere with IRES-mediated translation initiation owing to the proximity of its binding sites to the internal ribosome entry window.</p><p>To specifically examine the degree and kinetics of HuR repression of IRES-mediated translation, a time-course assay was performed similar to that shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>, except that cap analog was included to specifically block cap-dependent initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">59</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">61</xref>). HuR very potently repressed translation initiation through the IGF-IR IRES (&#x0003e;97%), and this potent repression remained essentially constant over at least 90 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>).</p><p>Together, the results presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figures 10</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">11</xref> indicate that there are probably two distinct components of HuR translational repression. One of these appears to be kinetically labile (repression of cap-dependent scanning), whereas the other component (repression of IRES-mediated translation initiation) remains static. The combination of these two components can explain the characteristics of HuR translation repression we have observed.</p></sec><sec><title>HuR is actively displaced by the scanning ribosome complex, but perpetually arrests internal ribosome entry</title><p>To further investigate the two components of translation repression by HuR through the IGF-IR 5&#x02032;-UTR, quantitative UV crosslinking assays were performed in the presence of RRL, allowing us to directly assess the interactions between HuR and the IGF-IR 5&#x02032;-UTR RNA in an active <italic>in vitro</italic> translation environment.

These results suggest that active scanning by the cap-dependent 43S complex is required to actively dissociate HuR from its binding sites.

This indicates that the affinity of HuR for the IGF-IR 5&#x02032;-UTR sequence is very high (actively binding in the presence of heparin), and by inference, its re-association with the RNA must have been perpetually blocked by the scanning ribosome complex (in the absence of heparin).</p><p>Based on these findings, we would anticipate that the capacity of HuR to function as a site-specific translation repressor would be compromised if active translation preceded its association with the RNA. Indeed, this is the case. If HuR is initially withheld for a variable period of time from the <italic>in vitro</italic> translation reaction, its ability to repress translation over a subsequent standard period of time is progressively diminished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12B</xref>). Thus it appears that the effectiveness of HuR as a repressor of translation initiation is heavily dependent upon occupation of its binding sites before commencement of active scanning by the 43S complex through the 5&#x02032;-UTR. One potential implication of this result is that association of HuR with the IGF-IR 5&#x02032;-UTR in the nucleus, perhaps co-transcriptionally, may be essential for its regulatory function <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><sec><title>Function of HuR as a 5&#x02032;-UTR-binding protein/translational repressor</title><p>We have begun to investigate the molecular mechanisms by which the complex 5&#x02032;-untranslated RNA sequence of the human IGF-IR transcript and the proteins with which it interacts contribute to the physiological regulation of IGF-IR expression. Here we have shown that the ELAV protein HuR specifically binds the IGF-IR 5&#x02032;-UTR and differentially represses cap-dependent and IRES-mediated translation initiation.</p><p>HuR has been predominantly characterized as a regulatory protein that binds specifically to consensus ARE within 3&#x02032;-untranslated sequences of multiple genes and enhances mRNA stability (generally resulting in a net increase in gene expression) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62">62</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b65">65</xref>). In this context, HuR enhances mRNA stability apparently by competing with other ARE-binding proteins which would otherwise target the mRNA for degradation from the 3&#x02032; end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b67">67</xref>). However, it is topologically and functionally significant, in the case of the IGF-IR mRNA, that HuR is binding upstream of the initiation codon. Binding of HuR directly to the 5&#x02032;-UTR of the IGF-IR transcript provides the opportunity for the translation apparatus to encounter this regulatory protein before initiation of translation of the IGF-IR coding sequence. Thus it is reasonable to anticipate a role for HuR in regulation of translation efficiency in the context of its binding the complex IGF-IR 5&#x02032;-UTR. Indeed, we have consistently observed that binding of HuR to its target sequences within the IGF-IR 5&#x02032;-UTR was associated with a decrease in translational efficiency both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>A model for differential repression of cap-dependent versus IRES-mediated translation initiation by HuR</title><p>Our functional data are indicative of the existence of two distinct mechanisms of action for HuR in its control of translation initiation through the IGF-IR 5&#x02032;-UTR (see the model proposed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13</xref>).</p><p>First, it appears that HuR significantly delays cap-dependent scanning by the 43S pre-initiation complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13</xref>, section I). Evidence for this conclusion is observed not only with the 5&#x02032;-UTR fragment used in the kinetic assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A and B</xref>), but also with the full-length IGF-IR 5&#x02032;-UTR reporter RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), where the HuR binding sites are located &#x0003e;890 nt from the 5&#x02032; end. Work done with the IRP-IRE system has provided precedent for ribosomal pausing and scanning arrest as a mechanism of translational repression from a cap-distal position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>). Yet, it appears that the scanning translation pre-initiation complex eventually is able to displace HuR from its binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12A</xref>, panel a), accounting for the decline in translation repression at later time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref>). Although it is clear that HuR is displaced from its binding site within the IGF-IR 5&#x02032;-UTR under conditions conducive to ribosomal scanning, we have not formally proven that the scanning 43S ribosomal complex directly displaces HuR; it remains plausible that one or more intermediate steps or factors are involved in mediating this outcome. Nevertheless, once HuR has been actively displaced, it appears that resumption of ribosomal scanning and active translation initiation perpetually interfere with the re-association of HuR with the RNA [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12A</xref> (panel c) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">B</xref>].</p><p>Considering the relatively short half-life of mRNA in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b68">68</xref>), the substantial delay to cap-dependent scanning by HuR is likely to result in a physiologically significant degree of translational repression. The high affinity of HuR for its binding sites within the IGF-IR 5&#x02032;-UTR may be a contributing factor to this repression. It is also possible that alterations in 5&#x02032;-UTR RNA structure induced or stabilized by interaction with HuR could influence the processivity of the scanning ribosomal complex [also see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b69">69</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b70">70</xref>)]. Furthermore, it is reasonable to speculate that, <italic>in vivo</italic>, there may be accessory proteins [translational co-repressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b71">71</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b72">72</xref>)] which cooperate with HuR to modulate translational efficiency.</p><p>It also appears that HuR is capable of effectively blocking IRES-mediated translation initiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13</xref>, section II). It is conceivable that HuR could prevent initial association of the IRES <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors (ITAFs) with the RNA (Step 1). Alternatively, HuR could block assembly of the IRES-associated ribosome&#x02013;ITAF complex at an intermediate stage (Step 2). Finally, HuR may allow the full assembly of the IRES-associated ribosome&#x02013;ITAF complex, but block its ability to initiate translation (Step 3). We favor either of the two latter possibilities (arrested partial or complete IRES complex) over the first (HuR alone bound to RNA), because it appears that an arrested HuR/ITAF &#x000b1; ribosome complex must be formed which is resistant to dissociation by cap-dependent 43S scanning complexes (HuR alone would be displaced), accounting at least in part for the plateau in HuR repression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B&#x02013;D</xref>) and the residual binding of HuR to the RNA at later time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12A</xref>). Sequestration of an arrested IRES complex by HuR could explain the highly potent and persistent repression of IRES-mediated translation initiation observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>).</p><p>The mechanisms of cellular IRES-mediated translation initiation are not well understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b73">73</xref>). A number of positive regulatory proteins enhancing IRES activity have been characterized [including hnRNP C, La, PTB and unr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b74">74</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b75">75</xref>)], and some of these positive ITAFs appear to function as RNA chaperones to facilitate the formation of RNA secondary structure permissive for recruitment of the 40S ribosome subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>). HuR is one of only a few recognized negative regulators of IRES function [also see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b76">76</xref>)]. It is possible that HuR may function as a negative ITAF, not necessarily by blocking binding of positive ITAFs and/or the 40S ribosome subunit, but by locking the 5&#x02032;-UTR RNA into a conformation which is not permissive for IRES-mediated translation initiation.</p></sec><sec><title>Perspective: the function of HuR in the composite regulation of IGF-IR expression through its complex 5&#x02032;-UTR</title><p>Based on the location of its binding sites, and its function as a dual-purpose translation repressor, HuR is poised to serve as a critical regulator of IGF-IR expression at the translational level. Binding to the extreme 3&#x02032; end of the 5&#x02032;-UTR, just upstream of the translation initiation codon, HuR stands as potentially the final obstacle to translation initiation via the conventional scanning 43S ribosome complex. Furthermore, because IRES-mediated translation initiation is likely to serve as an alternative to cap-dependent scanning under certain physiological conditions, the ability of the cell to modulate HuR's potent repression of the IGF-IR IRES will be crucial to allow appropriate fluctuations in IGF-IR expression in response to changes in microenvironment or cell status.</p><p>HuR also binds the 575 nt 5&#x02032;-UTR of the p27<sup>kip1</sup> mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b77">77</xref>) and functions as a translation repressor in this context as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>). However, this leaves us with an interesting question regarding the function of HuR in potentially simultaneously inhibiting expression of both a cell-cycle inhibitor and a powerful proliferation enhancer. This apparent contradiction in HuR function could be explained if the ability of HuR to bind its target sequences and repress translation is differentially regulated as a consequence of the distinct architectural organization of these two complex 5&#x02032;-untranslated RNA sequences. Giraud <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref>) identified PTB as a factor which specifically binds the rat IGF-IR 5&#x02032;-UTR, and our investigations have yielded evidence for additional regulatory components which can influence the interaction of HuR with its target sites within the human IGF-IR 5&#x02032;-UTR. We propose that HuR, in concert with these other sequence-specific regulatory proteins and structural features operating through the complex 5&#x02032;-UTR, combine to provide gene-specific regulation of IGF-IR expression at the translational level.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Dr Joan A.

The top section depicts the mechanism through which HuR delays translation initiation by the cap-dependent 43S scanning ribosome complex. In Step 1, HuR (blue oval) binds the IGF-IR 5&#x02032;-UTR, just upstream of the coding sequence (green rectangle). This does not prevent the recruitment of the 43S translation pre-initiation complex (green ellipse) to the cap structure (red circle) through interaction with the eIF4F complex (orange cylinder). In Step 2, the progress of the scanning 43S complex is impeded as a consequence of HuR binding to the 5&#x02032;-UTR. In Step 3, after a pause, the scanning 43S complex actively displaces HuR from its binding sites, and proceeds to productive translation initiation. It appears that, once HuR is displaced, active scanning of the 5&#x02032;-UTR perpetually interferes with re-association of HuR with the IGF-IR RNA. The bottom section illustrates three steps at which HuR could block IRES-mediated translation initiation. In Step 1, HuR may interfere with the initial binding of ITAFs to the 5&#x02032;-UTR. In Step 2, HuR may permit the association of ITAFs with the 5&#x02032;-UTR, but prevent the ITAFs from recruiting the 43S ribosome complex. In Step 3, HuR may allow formation of the full IRES-associated pre-initiation complex, but block productive translation initiation. We suspect that either Step 2 or 3 is the critical point at which HuR blocks IRES function, because the arrested partial or complete IRES-associated complex, not HuR alone, apparently then becomes resistant to displacement by the cap-dependent scanning ribosome complex.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gki603f13"/></fig><table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Comparison of the efficiency of RNA capture and recovery using different protocols or reagents for biotin labeling of RNA</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1"/><th align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">10% Bio-CTP</th><th align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">50% Bio-CTP</th><th align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">75% Bio-ATP</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Starting material</td><td align="right" colspan="1" rowspan="1">100</td><td align="right" colspan="1" rowspan="1">100</td><td align="right" colspan="1" rowspan="1">100</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Loading efficiency</td><td align="right" colspan="1" rowspan="1">58</td><td align="right" colspan="1" rowspan="1">92</td><td align="right" colspan="1" rowspan="1">63</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">After wash 2</td><td align="right" colspan="1" rowspan="1">54</td><td align="right" colspan="1" rowspan="1">87</td><td align="right" colspan="1" rowspan="1">55</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">After wash 3</td><td align="right" colspan="1" rowspan="1">50</td><td align="right" colspan="1" rowspan="1">85</td><td align="right" colspan="1" rowspan="1">50</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Elution efficiency</td><td align="right" colspan="1" rowspan="1">42</td><td align="right" colspan="1" rowspan="1">67</td><td align="right" colspan="1" rowspan="1">40</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>The results of pilot experiments used to gauge the optimal method for biotin incorporation into target RNA.
