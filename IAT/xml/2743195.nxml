Interleukin-10 (IL-10), although traditionally considered an anti-inflammatory cytokine, has also been implicated in promoting abnormal angiogenesis in the eye and in the pathobiology of autoimmune diseases such as lupus and encephalomyelitis.</p></sec><sec><title>Principal Findings</title><p>Overexpression of IL-10 in a transgenic mouse model leads to macrophage-mediated demyelinating polyneuropathy. IL-10 upregulates ICAM-1 within neural tissues, promoting massive macrophage influx, inflammation-induced demyelination, and subsequent loss of neural tissue resulting in muscle weakness and paralysis. The primary insult is to perineural myelin followed by secondary axonal loss. Infiltrating macrophages within the peripheral nerves demonstrate a highly pro-inflammatory signature. Macrophages are central players in the pathophysiology, as <italic>in vivo</italic> depletion of macrophages using clodronate liposomes reverses the phenotype, including progressive nerve loss and paralysis. Macrophage-mediate demyelination is dependent on Fas-ligand (FasL)-mediated Schwann cell death.</p></sec><sec><title>Significance</title><p>These findings mimic the human disease chronic idiopathic demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) and may also promote further understanding of the pathobiology of related conditions such as acute idiopathic demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP) or Guillain-Barr&#x000e9; syndrome.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Macrophages carry out a wide variety of biological functions and their ultimate effector phenotype is largely dependent upon activation and polarization. Polarization, in turn, is regulated by the dominant cytokine signature in the resident tissue microenvironment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007121-Kelly1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007121-Mantovani1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Macrophages can acquire a &#x0201c;classically-activated&#x0201d; phenotype (i.e. M1 macrophage) and display an anti-angiogenic, anti-bacterial, and pro-inflammatory functions; or an &#x0201c;alternatively-activated&#x0201d; phenotype (i.e. M2 macrophages) and display a pro-angiogenic and anti-inflammatory phenotype. Of the cytokines involved in macrophage polarization, the immunosuppressive cytokine interleukin 10 (IL-10) plays a highly robust role in M2 polarization. IL-10-mediated polarization of macrophages towards an M2 phenotype has a detrimental affect on the ability of macrophages to regulate abnormal angiogenesis as seen in the eye <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007121-Kelly1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007121-Apte1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007121-Dace1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. This has particular relevance to the eye as age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the leading cause of blindness in people over 50 years of age, is characterized by the development of abnormal blood vessels underneath the retina called choroidal neovascularization (CNV). In mouse models of CNV in AMD, IL-10 promotes pathological neovascularization by preventing macrophage infiltration into the choroid and by polarizing macrophages to a pro-angiogenic M2 phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007121-Apte1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. IL-10 has also been shown to promote pathological angiogenesis in the retina following ischemia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007121-Dace1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Our laboratory was interested in exploiting the pro-angiogenic and anti-inflammatory properties of IL-10 in a model of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). We constructed transgenic mice expressing murine IL-10 under the control of the human VMD2 gene promoter in B6CBAF2/J founder mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007121-Apte1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. VMD2 is located on chromosome 11q13, and encodes the 585 aa protein Bestrophin. Mutations in VMD2 have been implicated in Best vitelliform macular dystrophy and AMD, and bestrophin was originally identified as being localized to the basolateral plasma membrane of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007121-Marmorstein1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. VMD2-IL10 transgenic mice expressed high levels of secreted IL-10 in the retina, and were prone to develop CNV following laser-injury <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007121-Apte1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. After creation of VMD2-IL-10 transgenic mice, our laboratory began to backcross these mice to a C57BL/6 background. Surprisingly, IL-10 transgene-positive mice at the F5 backcross generation developed spontaneous hindlimb weakness around 3-months of age, followed by eventual paralysis. Veterinary necropsy of diseased animals revealed swollen peripheral nerves, with necrotic lesions and immune cell infiltrate. This pattern of paralysis continued through subsequent generations of transgenic mice. At the F11 backcross generation, transgenic mice were monitored for development of paralysis twice weekly, using a modified grading scale similar to mouse EAE models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007121-Stark1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. In this study we explore the pathobiology of the autoimmune polyneuropathy associated with transgenic IL-10 overexpression.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><p>Mice positive for the IL-10 transgene as determined by PCR analysis developed hind limb paralysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007121-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>).

GeneAtlas analysis reveals that in humans, VMD2 is highly expressed in the nervous system, including the spinal cord and multiple areas of the brain.

However, the full expression pattern of human VMD2 within murine tissues is unknown. Since human VMD2 was driving murine IL-10 expression in the Tg&#x0002b; mice, we examined gene expression of murine IL-10 in multiple tissues from Tg&#x0002b; sick mice compared to normal Tg&#x02212; control littermates, as Tg&#x02212; tissues should express baseline levels of IL-10. We found increased expression of IL-10 in the eye, sciatic nerve, spinal cord, testes, and brain of Tg&#x0002b; sick mice relative to IL-10 levels in the same tissues from Tg&#x02212; mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007121-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). Similar expression patterns of IL-10 were observed in Tg&#x0002b; healthy mice relative to Tg&#x02212; mice (data not shown). Based on studies demonstrating high VMD2 expression in the testes, and since IL-10 gene expression was 55,000 fold higher in the testes of Tg&#x0002b; mice, we sought to determine if increased IL-10 gene expression in the testes of male Tg&#x0002b; mice may exacerbate development of disease compared to female Tg&#x0002b; mice. Male Tg&#x0002b; mice developed a slightly accelerated paralysis compared to female Tg&#x0002b; mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007121-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>).

Tg&#x0002b; sick late (disease grade &#x02265;3) mice continued to have a dramatic infiltration of mononuclear cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007121-g003">Fig. 3D</xref>), and also exhibited a significant loss of sciatic nerve tissue, as evidenced by a decrease in tissue diameter.

Conversely, Tg&#x0002b; sick tissues revealed significant loss of myelin staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007121-g003">Fig. 3G and H</xref>). This correlation of cell infiltrate with loss of myelin in the sciatic nerve suggested that disease progression in Tg&#x0002b; mice was due to an autoimmune attack of the peripheral nerves. The central nervous system, including the brain (data not shown) and the spinal cord itself, seemed resistant to the effects of increased IL-10, as H&#x00026;E staining of the spinal cord tissue revealed no evidence of cell infiltrate in Tg&#x02212;, Tg&#x0002b; healthy, nor Tg&#x0002b; sick mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007121-g003">Fig. 3I-L</xref>).

Sciatic nerves, however, exhibited a primarily pro-inflammatory cytokine profile, with cytokine expression levels increasing with disease progression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007121-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>). These cytokines include FasL, IFN-&#x003b3;, and IL-12. The anti-inflammatory marker arginase (Arg1) was also increased in sciatic nerve tissues from sick mice, suggesting a possible attempt to squelch this burst of autoimmune activity. Pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokine gene expression is also evident in spinal cord tissue of Tg&#x0002b; sick mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007121-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>), albeit at drastically reduced levels compared to the sciatic nerve tissue.

To determine if VMD2-IL-10 Tg mice exhibited increased ICAM-1 expression, sciatic nerve and spinal cord tissues sections were stained with PE-conjugated anti-ICAM-1 antibody. Tg&#x02212; littermates exhibit no expression of ICAM-1 on sciatic nerve tissue sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007121-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>), whereas Tg&#x0002b; healthy and sick mice demonstrated significant staining of ICAM-1 antibody on the surface of the sciatic nerve tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007121-g006">Fig. 6B and C</xref>).

However, paralysis can be initiated by a variety of mechanisms other than antecedent demyelination. In addition, although mice did not clinically demonstrate evidence of weakness or paralysis prior to demyelination, it remained possible there was some subclinical axonal dysfunction prior to initiation of demyelination. This includes inherent neuronal defects resulting in neuromuscular dysfunction. In order to determine if Tg&#x0002b; mice have underlying axonal dysfunction prior to development of paralysis, we first stained sciatic nerve tissue sections with an antibody specific for normal neurofilament phenotype. The SMI-31 antibody reacts with a phosphorylated epitope in extensively phosphorylated neurofilament H and, to a lesser extent, with neurofilament M, a sign of normal neurofilament status. SMI 31 reacts broadly with thick and thin axons and some dendrites such as basket cell dendrites, but not Purkinje cell dendrites. Nerve cell bodies are generally unreactive, and other cells and tissues are unreactive except for peripheral axons. Damage to neurofilaments results in dephosphorylation of neurofilaments, and thus less reactivity with SMI-31. Wild-type mice demonstrated significant positive staining with SMI-31, reflecting a healthy axonal phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007121-g007">Fig. 7A</xref>). Tg&#x0002b; mice developed progressively decreased staining with SMI-31 as they developed weakness and paralysis reflecting axonal damage and loss with onset of paralysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007121-g007">Fig. 7B and C</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0007121-g007" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0007121.g007</object-id><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>Neural phenotype of VMD2-IL-10 transgenic mice.</title><p>A, Tg&#x02212; sciatic nerve sections are strongly reactive with the SMI-31 antibody, indicating normal neurofilament phosphorylation and phenotype.

This was done by examining voluntary wheel running (VWR) of Tg&#x0002b; mice and their Tg&#x02212; age-matched littermates. Three month-old Tg&#x0002b; mice, prior to developing clinical signs of weakness or motor dysfunction, showed no significant difference in VWR compared to Tg&#x02212; littermates, as determined by distance, time, and speed on the wheel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007121-g007">Fig. 7D</xref>). This demonstrates that although mice at 3 months of age demonstrate decreased neurofilament staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007121-g007">Fig. 7B</xref>), loss of function in these animals does not progress until cellular infiltration and demyelination occurs, indicating that macrophages are the primary mediators of disease in Tg&#x0002b; mice. This also demonstrates that paralysis and/or loss of activity is not due to an inherent neurological dysfunction in Tg&#x0002b; mice.</p><p>Disease progression in VMD2-IL-10 transgenic mice appears to develop in two stages. First, overexpression of IL-10 results in upregulation of ICAM-1 on sciatic nerve tissue. Secondly, macrophages infiltrate sciatic nerve tissue, cause demyelination, neuronal dysfunction, and ultimately paralysis. We wanted to test whether the onset of disease could be delayed or disease severity ameliorated by attempting to remove important components of disease progression: IL-10 and macrophages. We first attempted to block IL-10 protein expression with blocking antibodies to IL-10. Tg&#x0002b; mice were treated with intraperitoneal injections of 250 &#x000b5;g anti-IL-10 antibody or rat IgG control antibody i.p. 1&#x02013;2x weekly. Anti-IL-10 immunotherapy did not successfully delay progression of disease compared to isotype control administration (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007121.s002">Fig. S2I</xref>). Higher doses of anti-IL-10 were not successful and resulted in toxicity (data not shown). The lack of success with i.p. administration of anti-IL-10 was not surprising, as systemic levels of IL-10 were not elevated in transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007121-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). Moreover, systemically delivered antibodies would not readily cross blood-brain barriers and penetrate nerve tissues.</p><p>We next attempted to ameliorate disease by depletion of macrophages with clodronate liposomes. Tg&#x0002b; mice were treated with intraperitoneal injections of clodronate or PBS liposomes (200 &#x000b5;l initial injection; 100 &#x000b5;l each subsequent injection) twice weekly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007121-Fraser1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Liposome treatment commenced immediately prior to onset of disease (day 100).

Clodronate liposome treatment was continued for 2 months, and ceased at day 162 due to toxicity related to repeated liposome injection.

PBS liposome-treated Tg&#x0002b; mice continued to live past day 162, suggesting that toxicity is directly attributable to the clodronate and not to liposomes.

Although IL-10 is an immunosuppressive cytokine at normal levels, overexpression of IL-10 exacerbates inflammation.

Also, comparisons with Tg&#x0002b; healthy mice rather than Tg&#x02212; mice provide a representation of disease progression in Tg&#x0002b; mice rather than comparing Tg&#x0002b; mice with a wild-type phenotype.

Therefore, administration and/or localization of IL-10 may be critical in determining its immunoregulatory function in autoimmune diseases of the nervous system.</p><p>In our VMD2-IL-10 transgenic animals, IL-10 is not only upregulated in the sciatic nerve, but also the eye, brain, spinal cord, and especially the testes. However, our disease phenotype is restricted primarily to the sciatic nerve, and to a much lesser extent the caudal spinal cord. One hypothesis for why other organs are spared immune mediated destruction may be the immune privileged environment that these tissues possess. The eye, brain, and spinal cord are well known immune privileged sites, and possess various anti-inflammatory and pro-apoptotic molecules that may dampen an immune response in these tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007121-Ferguson1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007121-Niederkorn1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. Also, as the disease progresses from early stages to late stages, cellular infiltration and/or demyelination may be ascending from lower limbs to upper extremities, similar to human CIDP. This may explain while caudal spinal cord and brachial plexus nerves are not affected until later stages of disease. However, the effect of cellular infiltration into these tissues at these later stages on disease phenotype is not fully understood.</p><p>Polyneuropathies are a common neurological disease that affects the peripheral nervous system in humans. The use of animal models has helped to recapitulate and understand human neuropathies, however the transfer of treatment modalities from preclinical to clinical settings has been highly unsuccessful <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007121-MeyerzuHorste1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. This may be due to the fact that established animal models do not precisely mimic human disease. For example, experimental autoimmune neuritis (EAN), the most widely used model of Guillain-Barr&#x000e9; syndrome (GBS), involves the immunization of rats with peripheral myelin homogenates, myelin proteins, or derived peptides to produce disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007121-MeyerzuHorste1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. This results in a primarily T cell mediated attack and demyelination of the peripheral nerves. GBS, however, results from macrophages serving as the primary effector cells in the demyelination of the peripheral nervous system. The VMD2-IL-10 transgenic mouse model may be a useful mouse model for the study of GBS pathogenesis and treatment. Animal models of CIDP have been extremely problematic in mimicking human disease. EAN models are acute, with disease recovery occurring substantially by 28 days. Other animal models for CIDP involve repeated myelin immunization that may be combined with immunosuppression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007121-MeyerzuHorste1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. These models are not ideal, as they are primarily performed in species other than mice, hampering the use of genetic knockout animals.</p><p>Interestingly, a mouse model of CIDP has been previously demonstrated in B7-2 deficient non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007121-Salomon1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. This animal model results in the infiltration of T cells and dendritic cells into the peripheral nervous system. However, disease progression was not congruent between both sexes, and cellular infiltration lacked macrophages as observed in human CIDP. In addition, autoimmune disease in these mice was manifested on two genetic backgrounds with preexisting immunodeficiencies.
