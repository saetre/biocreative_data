The TRAF6 RING finger domain functions as an ubiquitin E3 ligase capable of generating non-degradative K63-linked ubiquitin chains. It is believed that these chains serve as docking sites for formation of signaling complexes, and that K63-linked autoubiquitination of TRAF6 is essential for formation and activation of a complex involving the kinase TAK1 and its adapters, TAB1 and TAB2. In order to assess independently the E3 ligase and ubiquitin substrate functions of TRAF6, we generated, respectively, RING domain and complete lysine-deficient TRAF6 mutants. We found that while the TRAF6 RING domain is required for activation of TAK1, it is dispensable for interaction between TRAF6 and the TAK1-TAB1-TAB2 complex. Likewise, lysine-deficient TRAF6 was found to interact with the TAK1-TAB1-TAB2 complex, but surprisingly was also found to be fully competent to activate TAK1, as well as NF&#x003ba;B and AP-1 reporters. Furthermore, lysine-deficient TRAF6 rescued IL-1-mediated NF&#x003ba;B and MAPK activation, as well as IL-6 elaboration in retrovirally-rescued TRAF6-deficient fibroblasts. Lysine-deficient TRAF6 also rescued RANKL-mediated NF&#x003ba;B and MAPK activation, and osteoclastogenesis in retrovirally-rescued TRAF6-deficient bone marrow macrophages. While incapable of being ubiquitinated itself, we demonstrate that lysine-deficient TRAF6 remains competent to induce ubiquitination of IKK&#x003b3;/NEMO. Further, this NEMO modification contributes to TRAF6-mediated activation of NF&#x003ba;B. Collectively, our results suggest that while TRAF6 autoubiquitination may serve as a marker of activation, it is unlikely to underpin RING finger-dependent TRAF6 function.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Non-conventional K63-linked ubiquitination has gained attention in recent years as a mechanism of protein scaffold building for complex formation during signal transduction.

A particularly notable K63-specific RING finger E3 ubiquitin ligase is TNFR-associated factor 6 (TRAF6), which was identified as having such activity upon being isolated from an I&#x003ba;B kinase (IKK)-activating complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004064-Deng1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004064-Wang1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Like most other TRAFs, TRAF6 is composed of an N-terminal RING finger domain, a series of zinc fingers, a coiled-coil domain, and a C-terminal TRAF domain. TRAF6 is unique from other TRAFs in that it utilizes a distinct interaction motif, which is found in its upstream activators <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004064-Ye1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. As such, TRAF6 has been implicated in directing the signals from representative members of a diverse array of receptor families, including the TNF receptor superfamily (TNFRSF), IL-1R/Toll-like receptor superfamily (IL-1R/TLRSF), TGF&#x003b2;R, IL-17R and IL-25R, and the NOD-like pattern recognition receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004064-Abbott1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004064-Lee1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004064-Maezawa1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004064-Schwandner1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004064-Sorrentino1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004064-Wu1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004064-Yamashita1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. TRAF6 activation leads to downstream activation of PI3K, the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade, and the transcription factor families NF&#x003ba;B, NFAT, and IRF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004064-Wu1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004064-Takaoka1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004064-Takayanagi1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Numerous biochemical and genetic studies have revealed mechanistic insights into TRAF6 utilization of ubiquitination to propagate diverse signals. To date, the most prominent model holds that upon activation via TRAF6 homo-oligimerization, the RING finger ubiquitin E3 ligase domain complexes with a K63-specific E2 conjugating enzyme (Ubc13/Uev1a, or possibly UbcH7) to mediate attachment of non-degradative K63-linked ubiquitin chains to TRAF6 substrates, specifically TRAF6 itself <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004064-Deng1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004064-Geetha1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. These chains recruit factors, like the adapters TAB2/3, which contain atypical zinc finger domains with a special affinity for binding K63-linked ubiquitin chains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004064-Kanayama1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. As part of a pre-formed complex, TAB2/3 bring TAB1 and the putative IKK and MKK kinase TAK1 to TRAF6 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004064-Wang1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. It is believed that TAK1 is then activated via a trans-phosphorylation event made possible by the close proximity generated by complex formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004064-Chen1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004064-Singhirunnusorn1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Activated TAK1 then phosphorylates downstream factors. However, the complexities involved in studying ubiquitin-mediated signaling events have made certain aspects of this model difficult to formally demonstrate. For instance, putative ubiquitin targets are often ubiquitinated with both K48-linked degradative and K63-linked non-degradative chains at multiple locations. A further complication is the propensity of ubiquitination complexes to generate chains of varying lengths at a given modification site <italic>in vivo</italic>, making detection of ubiquitination by traditional size separation techniques challenging. Attempts to genetically manipulate lysine acceptor sites on protein substrates with the intention of ablating E3 ligase-specific ubiquitination may result in dramatically decreased modification, while failing to entirely eliminate physiologically relevant ubiquitin chains that happen to be affixed at low levels or heterotypic lengths. Lastly, while autoubiquitination is often readily detected in the context of <italic>in vitro</italic> ubiquitination, these assays feature a well-recognized caveat of increased E3 ligase promiscuity in the absence of alternative targets, such that the same autoubiquitination event observed <italic>in vitro</italic> may not have physiologic relevance <italic>in vivo</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004064-Haglund1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004064-VanDemark1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, we sought to investigate, through genetic approaches, the relationship between TRAF6 RING finger ubiquitin E3 ligase activity, TRAF6 (auto)ubiquitination (for the purpose of clarity we will refer to all K63-linked ubiquitination of TRAF6 as autoubiquitination, while recognizing that additional ubiquitin E3 ligases may be involved in TRAF6 K63-linked modification <italic>in vivo</italic>) and recruitment and activation of downstream signaling. We found that while the TRAF6 RING finger domain is required for activation of TAK1, it is dispensable for interaction between TRAF6 and the TAK1-TAB1-TAB2 complex. Surprisingly, we found that TRAF6 autoubiquitination was dispensable for both interaction with, and activation of, the TAK1 signaling complex. Further, TRAF6 autoubiquitination, but not RING finger function, was found to be dispensable for IL-1- or RANKL-dependent elaboration of IL-6, or osteoclastogenesis, respectively. Finally, TRAF6 autoubiquitination was found not to be required for TRAF6 to ubiquitinate an alternative target, specifically IKK&#x003b3; (NEMO).</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>TRAF6 associates with the TAK1-TAB1-TAB2 complex in the absence of a functional TRAF6 RING finger domain</title><p>It has previously been demonstrated that TRAF6 RING finger function, K63-linked ubiquitination, and the ubiquitin-binding domain of TAB2 are required for TRAF6-mediated activation of downstream signaling pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004064-Kanayama1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. It is believed that TRAF6 autoubiquitination serves as a point of recruitment for TAB2, and hence TAB1 and TAK1. If so, we reasoned that overexpression of a TRAF6 mutant possessing a defective RING finger (C70A), and therefore incapable of autoubiquitination, should not inhibit NF&#x003ba;B activation induced by co-overexpression of TAK1 and its activator, TAB1. Rather, in reporter assays for NF&#x003ba;B, we found that while overexpression of wild-type TRAF6 in conjunction with TAB1 and TAK1 enhanced reporter activity over TAB1 and TAK1 alone, overexpression of RING finger-mutant TRAF6 (C70A) caused a greater than 2-fold reduction in activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004064-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). To assess the importance of the TRAF6 RING finger function to interaction with the TAK1 complex, we performed a co-immunoprecipiation assay, and found that another TRAF6 mutant containing a defective RING finger (C85A/H87A) interacted more strongly with TAK1 than did wild-type TRAF6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004064-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). Like other TRAF proteins, TRAF6 forms homo- and heterotypic interactions via a C-terminal TRAF domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004064-Baud1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. To exclude the possibility that a full-length TRAF6 RING mutant might compensate for defective complex formation through interactions with endogenous TRAF proteins, we generated mutants in which the C-terminus of TRAF6 is replaced with the artificial oligomerization domain of bacterial Gyrase B. Again, we found that RING-mutant TRAF6 interacted as well, or better with TAB2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004064-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>), TAB1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004064-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>), and TAK1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004064-g001">Fig. 1E</xref>). Given that TRAF6 autoubiquitination requires a functional RING finger, these observations challenge the putative relationship between TRAF6 autoubiquitination and recruitment of the TAK1 signaling complex to TRAF6.</p><fig id="pone-0004064-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004064.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>TRAF6 associates with the TAK1-TAB1-TAB2 complex in the absence of a functional TRAF6 RING finger domain.</title><p>(A) 293T cells were transfected with NF&#x003ba;B-luciferase, 40 ng TAB1 and TAK1, and 400 ng of empty vector (EV), TRAF6, or TRAF6 C70A as indicated.

Physiologic relevance of TRAF6 autoubiquitination has been inferred from the dual observations that 1) TRAF6 autoubiquitination is detected <italic>in vivo</italic> upon engagement of TRAF6-dependent receptors, and 2) the TRAF6 RING finger is required for propagating downstream signal transduction. Recent efforts have been made to map the lysines residue(s) on TRAF6 targeted during <italic>in vitro</italic> autoubiquitination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004064-Lamothe1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. However, it remains unclear whether, or in what pattern, TRAF6 might combine with other K63-specific E3 ubiquitin ligases to ubiquitinate TRAF6 <italic>in vivo</italic>. Therefore, we sought to divorce the RING finger function of TRAF6 from its capacity to serve as a substrate for ubiquitination. We employed a mutagenesis approach targeting individual lysine residues, which form isopeptide bonds with the carboxyl-terminal glycine 76 of ubiquitin, to ablate TRAF6 autoubiquitination during <italic>in vivo</italic> overexpression. However, we were only able to achieve partial reduction in ubiquitination, possibly due to modification of TRAF6 at multiple sites. Therefore, reasoning that we could focus on the N-terminus, due to its ability to activate downstream signaling when fused to Gyrase B, we simultaneously mutated all N-terminal TRAF6 lysine residues (K32-348) on both full-length and (1-358)-Gyrase B fusion versions of TRAF6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004064-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). We tested the ability of the full-length TRAF6 (K32-348R) mutant to autoubiquitinate in an <italic>in vitro</italic> ubiquitination assay and found that K63-specific modification of TRAF6 was reduced to a level similar to that of the TRAF6 RING finger mutant (C70A) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004064-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). By utilizing the TRAF6(1-358)-Gyrase B mutant (&#x00394;K) to assess interaction with TAK1 in 293T cells, we found that &#x00394;K interacted with TAK1 more strongly than wild-type TRAF6, though less strongly than C70A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004064-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>), demonstrating dispensability of TRAF6 autoubiquitination for complex formation with TAK1. In the IL-1 signaling pathway, optimal TAK1-mediated activation of JNK and NF&#x003ba;B requires phosphorylation of TAK1 at T187 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004064.s002">Fig. S2</xref>). To assess the ability of TRAF6 mutants to activate TAK1, we transfected low levels of TRAF6(1-358)-Gyrase B mutants and induced oligomerization using the drug Coumermycin A1. While all TRAF6 constructs exhibited interaction with TAK1 in the absence of drug, and only the RING mutant failed to activate TAK1 in the presence of drug, the &#x00394;K mutant exhibited enhanced activation of TAK1 in comparison to wild-type TRAF6, even in the absence of drug treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004064-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>), suggesting that TRAF6 autoubiquitination may be dispensable for activation of TAK1-mediated signaling. The various TRAF6-Gyrase B mutants were then tested in reporter assays for NF&#x003ba;B and AP-1, and consistent with its apparent enhanced ability to activate TAK1, the &#x00394;K mutant induced both NF&#x003ba;B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004064-g002">Fig. 2E</xref>) and AP-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004064-g002">Fig. 2F</xref>) reporters to higher levels than wild-type TRAF6.</p><fig id="pone-0004064-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004064.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>A lysine-deficient TRAF6 N-terminus-Gyrase B fusion protein interacts with and activates TAK1, and induces NF&#x003ba;B and AP-1 reporter activity.</title><p>(A) Generation of mutant versions of murine TRAF6 containing lysine (K) to arginine (R) mutations in the RING finger, zinc finger, and coiled-coil domains (TRAF6 K32-348R) (top), or in the RING finger, zinc finger, and coiled-coil domains, but with the TRAF6-C domain replaced with the Gyrase B artificial oligomerization domain (TRAF6(1-358)&#x00394;K-Gyrase B) (bottom).

TRAF6 autoubiquitination is commonly used as an activation marker for RING finger activity, and it is currently held that K63-linked ubiquitin chains on TRAF6 serve as a docking platform for downsteam mediators like TAK1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004064-Chen1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. In this context, the requirement for TRAF6 autoubiquitination per se has not been formally demonstrated. We attempted to do so by divorcing the RING finger function of TRAF6 from its ubiquitin substrate function. Surprisingly, we found that in the absence of TRAF6 autoubiquitination, IL-1- and RANKL-dependent signaling remained intact in the presence of a functional RING finger domain. Retrovirally-rescued TRAF6-deficient fibroblasts elaborated IL-6 in response to IL-1, and retrovirally-rescued TRAF6-deficient BMM developed into osteoclasts in response to RANKL, both independently of TRAF6 autoubiquitination. TRAF6 autoubiquitination was also found to be dispensable for TRAF6 RING finger-dependent ubiqutination of NEMO. Further, we found that neither TRAF6 autoubiquitination, nor the RING finger domain were required for TRAF6 interaction with the TAK1 complex.</p><p>Our initial efforts to identify specific ubiquitin acceptor lysines on TRAF6 revealed that while we could detect reduced TRAF6 autoubiquitination in some cases, these reductions were not accompanied by reduced TRAF6 function. This was true even for TRAF6 K124, the recently identified acceptor site reported to be essential simultaneously for TRAF6 autoubiquitination and signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004064-Lamothe1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004064.s003">Fig. S3</xref>). By taking the dramatic step of mutating all lysines on TRAF6 to arginine in order to ablate all potential acceptor sites, we were forced to acknowledge certain caveats. First, some residues may be important for protein stability. While lysine ablation did not affect expression of N-terminal TRAF6&#x00394;K(1-358), full-length &#x00394;K protein expression was dramatically reduced. Regardless, any loss in protein stability was not sufficient to affect the signaling functions examined. Second, we may have inadvertently abrogated the capacity of TRAF6 to undergo other lysine-dependent modifications, such as acetylation, methylation, sumoylation, or K48-linked degradative ubiquitination. Published data indicates a negative regulatory mechanism for TRAF6 via IFN&#x003b3;-induced K48-linked ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004064-Takayanagi2">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>.

However, our data demonstrate that TRAF6 autoubiquitination is clearly dispensable for TRAF6 function in two key signaling pathways, and suggest that TRAF6-mediated K63-linked ubiquitination instead targets multiple relevant protein substrates during activation. Hopefully these findings will contribute specifically to defining the mechanism of TRAF6 function, and generally to elucidating the role of non-conventional ubiquitination in signal transduction.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cell Lines, Reagents, and Antibodies</title><p>HEK293 cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC).
