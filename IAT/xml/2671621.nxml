Osmotic stress and cold stress are perceived by either ABA-dependent or ABA-independent pathways. These pathways lead to the expression of some common downstream stress-responsive proteins such as RD29A, COR15A, KIN1, and ADH1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kurkela and Franck, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jarillo <italic>et al.</italic>, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Yamaguchi-Shinozaki and Shinozaki, 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Stockinger <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ishitani <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>). Many genes that are either involved in the signalling pathways or directly responsible for the stress tolerance are identified through transcriptome analysis. However, more signalling components that participate in the plant responses to abiotic stresses are expected, due to the complex environment that plants are facing. One such candidate is HHP1 (heptahelical transmembrane protein 1) which is induced in the transcription level with salt treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hsieh and Goodman, 2005</xref>).</p><p>HHP1 is a member of the HHP family from <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> which comprises at least five members HHP1, HHP2, HHP3, HHP4, and HHP5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hsieh and Goodman, 2005</xref>). The HHP protein family is homologous to the PAQR family of proteins which include the membrane progestin receptor (mPR), adiponectin receptor (AdipoR), and YOL002c (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yamauchi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lyons <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). The wide distribution of the PAQR family members indicates that they may have diversified from a common ancestor and evolved to have different functions. The mPR protein is involved in a novel &#x02018;non-genomic&#x02019; signalling pathway for steroid hormones. In animals, steroid hormones transmit signals through members of the nuclear receptor protein superfamily. This is mainly attributed to the hydrophobic nature of steroids, which allows them to cross cell membranes without help from proteins. However, many lines of evidence have demonstrated the presence of an alternative signalling pathway for steroids through membrane-bound receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Falkenstein <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>). This type of signalling is not blocked by transcriptional inhibitors and is therefore described as the &#x02018;non-genomic action&#x02019; of steroids. The AdipoR is the receptor of adiponectin which has an antidiabetic effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yamauchi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). The YOL002c is proposed to regulate the homeostasis of zinc ions through its role in the metabolism of sterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lyons <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). We are interested in how the PAQR proteins have evolved across animals and plants and the possible role of PAQR homologues in salt sensing or signalling.</p><p>The mRNA expression patterns of the five <italic>HHP</italic> genes in response to phytohormones, sucrose, temperature, and salt have been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hsieh and Goodman, 2005</xref>), however, further experiments are needed to elucidate the functions of the HHP family. HHP proteins are identified from the primary structural analysis by the seven predicted transmembrane domains and the lack of similarity to G protein-coupled receptors. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, there are at least 168 proteins which possess seven transmembrane domains based on TransMembrane Spanning (TMS) domain prediction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ward, 2001</xref>). To avoid the complexity that was raised from the diversity of function within the HHP family and to narrow down our target, the AtHHP1 was chosen in this study, which is the closest homologue of mPR in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. The five AtHHP proteins fall into three groups based on phylogenetic analysis. Among them, AtHHP2 and AtHHP3 form one group (77.3% similarity between them), and AtHHP4 and AtHHP5 form another group (96.1% similarity between them) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hsieh and Goodman, 2005</xref>). The sequence similarities between AtHHP1 and the other two groups are 52.2% and 44.0%, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hsieh and Goodman, 2005</xref>).</p><p>Due to the fact that expression levels of <italic>HHP</italic> genes are differentially regulated by the treatment of salt, an attempt has been made to explore the possible roles played by HHP1 in high salinity stress signalling. High salinity stress sensing and tolerance share some common signalling components with other abiotic stresses such as drought and cold. There are at least six signalling pathways present in plants when they are exposed to drought or high salinity stresses. Of these pathways, three are independent of ABA and the other three are ABA-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Shinozaki and Yamaguchi-Shinozaki, 2007</xref>). DRE (dehydration-responsive element)/CRT (C-repeat element) and ABRE (ABA-responsive element) are the major <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements in the ABA-independent and ABA-dependent signalling pathways, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). Other <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements include MYCR (MYC transcription factor recognition sequence), MYBR (MYB transcription factor recognition sequence), NACR (NAC recognition sequence), ZFHDR (zinc-finger homeodomain recognition sequence) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yamaguchi-Shinozaki and Shinozaki, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chinnusamy <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>). Osmotic and cold stresses lead to the expressions of several kinds of genes including the ABA-signalling genes (<italic>ABI1</italic>, <italic>ABI2</italic>, <italic>ABI3</italic>, and <italic>ABI5</italic>), ABA biosynthetic genes (<italic>NCED3</italic>, <italic>AAO3</italic>, <italic>ABA1</italic>, and <italic>ABA3</italic>), and common downstream stress-responsive genes (<italic>RD29A</italic>, <italic>RD29B</italic>, <italic>ADH1</italic>, <italic>KIN1</italic>, <italic>COR15A</italic>, and <italic>COR47</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kurkela and Franck, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jarillo <italic>et al.</italic>, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Yamaguchi-Shinozaki and Shinozaki, 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Stockinger <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ishitani <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>).</p><p>In this study, it is demonstrated that the HHP1-defective mutant (<italic>hhp1-1</italic>) had a higher sensitivity to ABA and osmotic stress in terms of germination rate and post-germination growth rate. The higher expression of the downstream stress-responsive genes was compatible with the phenotype. It is concluded that HHP1 might play a role in osmotic stress signalling and act as a negative regulator. The possibility that HHP1 might serve as a novel signalling component of osmotic signalling is discussed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Sequence analysis</title><p>The sequences of the PAQR protein family were retrieved by a BLAST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Altschul <italic>et al.</italic>, 1990</xref>) search based on the sequence of HHP1 against the databases of SwissProt/TrEMBL.

HHP1, consisting of 332 amino acids annotated in the TAIR (The <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> Information Resource) as the expressed protein containing a haemolysin-III-related domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1Aa</xref>). A phylogenetic tree was generated to depict the relationship between HHP1 and its homologues within the PAQR protein family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1Ab</xref>). All of these homologues contain the haemolysin-III-related domain comprising seven predicted TMs, an N-terminal domain, a C-terminal domain, and six loops connecting TMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1Aa</xref>). The length of the HHP1 is comparable to those of their PAQR homologues, for example, mPR from human (NP_848509; 346 amino acids), adiponectin receptor from human (ADR1, NP_057083; 375 amino acids), and YOL002c from <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (IZH2; 317 amino acids). The location of the seven predicted TM &#x003b1;-helices determines the sizes of the N- and C-terminal domains and the loops connecting TMs. HHP1 has a longer N-terminal segment comprising 96 amino acids, a shorter C-terminal segment comprising six amino acids and six short loops, ranging from five to 20 amino acids, connecting TMs. In order to investigate the physiological function of the <italic>HHP</italic> gene family, a search for T-DNA insertion mutants from ABRC stocks was made using the SIGnAL &#x02018;T-DNA Express&#x02019; <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> Gene Mapping Tool (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://signal.salk.edu">http://signal.salk.edu</ext-link>). Plants from seeds of the <italic>AtHHP1</italic> mutant (SALK_056174) were screened for homozygous single T-DNA insertions. Individual homozygous plants derived from the SALK line were identified by PCR screening using primers specific for the <italic>AtHHP1</italic> gene and the left border primer of the T-DNA insertion. Fifteen homozygous plants derived from the SALK_056174 T<sub>4</sub> lines were confirmed by RT-PCR not to express full-length <italic>HHP1</italic> CDS. The single T-DNA insertion lines, SALK_056174_10 T<sub>7</sub> were verified using inverse PCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Does <italic>et al.</italic>, 1991</xref>).

The PAQR family is predicted to have a 7TM topology, but lacks any significant sequence similarity with GPCRs. Based on phylogenetic analyses, it is subdivided into three subgroups of adiponectin receptor-related, mPR-related, and haemolysin-III-related (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fernandes <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). In this study, we characterized the HHP1 in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> that is the most closely related to the adiponectin receptor-related PAQR subgroup. Whether HHPs and other PAQR members have the structure and function similar to GPCRs is intriguing. Seatrout mPR has been predicted to have an N-terminal outside topology, as in the GPCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zhu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>) whereas the adiponectin receptor has been shown to adopt an N-terminal inside topology, as revealed by epitope tagging experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yamauchi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). Topology prediction by TMHMM method favoured an N-terminal inside topology for HHPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hsieh and Goodman, 2005</xref>), so the involvement of G-protein signalling, as suggested for the mPR, may not be applied to HHPs.</p></sec><sec><title>HHP1 is involved in the ABA and osmotic stress response</title><p>Sensitivity/susceptibility to abiotic stresses is a very complex phenomenon and there are intricate signalling pathways which enable plants to tolerate, and adapt in response to, exogenous osmotic stress. The elucidation of the mechanism of osmotic stress signalling may be beneficial in breeding by improving stress tolerance in crops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fujita <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Xiong <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002<italic>b</italic></xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Apse and Blumwald, 2002</xref>). Phytohormones, such as SA, JA, ethylene, and ABA, regulate the protective responses of plants against biotic and abiotic stresses via signalling cross-talk. Both ABA-dependent and ABA-independent signalling pathways appear to be involved in osmotic stress sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chinnusamy <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fujita <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Xiong <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002<italic>b</italic></xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Schroeder and Nambara, 2006</xref>). In this study, it is shown that HHP1 was a novel component of an ABA-regulated osmotic stress response in several lines of evidence. First, the promoter region of <italic>HHP1</italic> was found to contain an ABRE-related element and DPBF, MYB, and MYC recognition sequences, which are the downstream targets of ABA-dependent osmotic stress signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chinnusamy <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Xiong <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002<italic>b</italic></xref>), and the expression of <italic>HHP1</italic> was induced by ABA and osmotic stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figs 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>), indicating that <italic>HHP1</italic> could be a downstream stress-responsive gene of an ABA-dependent signalling pathway. Second, the fact that the <italic>hhp1-1</italic> mutant was more sensitive to ABA and osmotic stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figs 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>) implies that HHP1 may be involved in stress sensitivity and act as a negative regulator in response to ABA and osmotic stress in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. Third, inducing expression of stress-responsive genes, ABA-signalling genes, and ABA biosynthetic genes by ABA and osmotic stress was more sensitive in <italic>hhp1-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6</xref>). Taken together, HHP1 is likely to be an upstream negative regulator in the ABA and osmotic signalling pathways.</p></sec><sec><title>The possible relationship between HHP1 and osmotin</title><p>It is very interesting to note that osmotin, an antifungal basic PR5 protein from tobacco that exhibits a similar overall structural fold to adiponectin, causes apoptosis of yeast via YOL002c, an adiponectin receptor homologue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Narasimhan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>).
