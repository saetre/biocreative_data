The Rab27 subfamily consists of Rab27a and Rab27b. Rab27a has been recently implicated in Griscelli Disease, a disease combining partial albinism with severe immunodeficiency. Rab27a plays a key role in the function of lysosomal-like organelles such as melanosomes in melanocytes and lytic granules in cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Little is known about Rab27b.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The human <italic>RAB27B</italic> gene is organised in six exons, spanning about 69 kb in the chromosome 18q21.1 region. Exon 1 is non-coding and is separated from the others by 49 kb of DNA and exon 6 contains a long 3' untranslated sequence (6.4 kb). The mouse <italic>Rab27b</italic> cDNA shows 95% identity with the human cDNA at the protein level and maps to mouse chromosome 18. The mouse mRNA was detected in stomach, large intestine, spleen and eye by RT-PCR, and in heart, brain, spleen and kidney by Northern blot. Transient over-expression of EGF-Rab27b fusion protein in cultured melanocytes revealed that Rab27b is associated with melanosomes, as observed for EGF-Rab27a.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our results indicate that the Rab27 subfamily of Ras-like GTPases is highly conserved in mammals. There is high degree of conservation in sequence and gene structure between <italic>RAB27A</italic> and <italic>RAB27B</italic> genes. Exogenous expression of Rab27b in melanocytes results in melanosomal association as observed for Rab27a, suggesting the two Rab27 proteins are functional homologues. As with <italic>RAB27A</italic> in Griscelli Disease, <italic>RAB27B</italic> may be also associated with human disease mapping to chromosome 18.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Rab proteins constitute a large group within the Ras superfamily of low molecular weight GTPases. Rab GTPases regulate vesicular transport steps in endocytic and exocytic pathways, acting as molecular switches oscillating between active GTP-bound and inactive GDP-bound states [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Over 50 different Rab proteins have been identified to date in mammalian cells while the yeast <italic>S. cerevisae</italic> has 11 Rabs (termed Ypt and Sec4) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Within this family of proteins, most members share about 35% identity, while there are some Rabs that show unusually high identity (more than 70%) and are considered isoforms, eg, Rab1a and Rab1b.</p><p>The Rab27 subfamily consists of Rab27a (previously designated Ram) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] and Rab27b (previously designated c25KG) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Rab27a was initially cloned from a megakaryocyte library and subsequent studies revealed that it is expressed in haemopoietic-derived cells, melanocytes in skin and eye, lung, pancreas and intestine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Other tissues such as liver, kidney, brain and muscle show little if any expression of Rab27a. In a previous study, we reported a characterization of the human <italic>RAB27A</italic> gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The <italic>RAB27A</italic> gene comprises five coding exons and two non-coding exons, of which one is alternatively used, and spans approximately 65 kb of DNA. <italic>RAB27A</italic> was mapped to chromosome 15q21 by fluorescence in situ hybridization and radiation hybrid mapping.</p><p>More recently, <italic>RAB27A</italic> was identified as one gene responsible for Griscelli Disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Griscelli Disease is caused by two unrelated genes coincidentally mapping very close to each other at the 15q21 locus, <italic>RAB27A</italic> and <italic>MYO5A</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Griscelli Disease is a rare autosomal disorder characterized by partial albinism, variable cellular immunodeficiency and an acute phase of uncontrolled T lymphocyte and macrophage activation. In some cases, a neurological defect rather than immunological disease prevails. It appears that Griscelli Disease associated with immunological disease is caused by mutations in <italic>RAB27A</italic>, while Griscelli Disease associated with neurological disease is caused by mutations in <italic>MYO5A</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Mouse models for Griscelli Disease already exist and they are the result of mutations in <italic>Rab27a</italic> (ashen mouse, <italic>ash</italic>) or <italic>MyoVa</italic> (dilute mouse, <italic>d</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>Griscelli disease and related diseases such as Hermansky-Pudlak and Chediak-Higashi syndromes involve defects in intracellular sorting, maturation and/or secretion of specialized lysosome-like organelles. These have also been called "secretory" lysosomes and examples include lytic granules in T lymphocytes, dense platelet granules, and melanosomes in melanocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Our recent studies suggest that Rab27a plays a critical role in the biology of secretory lysosomes. In melanocytes, Rab27a seems to be required with Myosin Va for the peripheral capture of melanosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In cytotoxic T lymphocytes, Rab27a is required for the secretion of lytic granules and thus for target cell lysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>Much less is known about Rab27b. Rab27b was originally purified from platelets and cloned from melanoma mRNA by RT-PCR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. As a first step towards the study of <italic>RAB27B</italic> and its possible involvement in human disease, we report here a characterization of the human and murine Rab27b genes.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Gene Structure of the human <italic>RAB27B</italic> gene</title><p>To study the gene structure of <italic>RAB27B</italic>, three P1 clones containing inserts of 90 kb (designated gs15454), 86 kb (gs15455) and 97 kb (gs15502) respectively, were isolated. Hybridization of the <italic>RAB27B</italic> cDNA (U57093) probe to DNA digested with <italic>Eco</italic> RI, <italic>Hind</italic> III and <italic>Bam</italic> HI gave the same pattern of bands for genomic and P1 DNA indicating that <italic>RAB27B</italic> is a single copy gene and that the P1 clones contain this gene. The sizes of the restriction fragments hybridizing to each exon are given in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>. The exon/intron boundaries were determined by sequencing following subcloning of four <italic>Eco</italic> RI fragments containing the exons.

Exons 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 could all be accurately mapped in relation to each other and lie within about 19 kb and our studies suggested that exon 1 was located at least 30 kb from exon 2. While this work was in progress, sequence from two BACs containing the human <italic>RAB27B</italic> gene were deposited in the database of high throughput genomic sequence (NCBI). The genomic sequences have the accession numbers AC007673 and AP001910. The BAC AC007673 contains exon 1 (55,377-55,154), exon 2 (6,287-6,116) and exon 3 (4,485-4,400). The exons 4 and 6 are in the BAC AP001910 (96,303-96,200 and 116,297-115,786) but the partial sequences of this BAC are unordered. The genomic sequence for exon 5 was not found in the AP001910 sequence probably due to the sequence of this BAC being incomplete.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Restriction map of <italic>RAB27A</italic> and neighboring genomic sequences.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] showed the most abundant transcript in most tissues to be of approximately 8 kb which is much larger than the 1.026 kb cDNA (U57093) reported by the same authors. The cDNA was cloned by RT-PCR of the coding region followed by 5' and 3' race and it is unlikely that the 3' race would have extended through a large 3' region of several kilobases. Database mining allowed us to identify the full 3' region of the mRNA. Using the U57093 sequence, we searched the human EST database and identified 9 ESTs; AA588753, AI432357, AA812916, AA846320, AW664866, AW370404, AW592937 (these 7 ESTs make up UniGene Hs.97189), BF088963 and BF243879. The most 3' of these, AW592937, did not bring up any more ESTs. However, searching the EST database with the corresponding region of the AP001910 BAC sequence identified a further 31 ESTs which are probably located in a single 6.6 kb 3' exon. Ten of these ESTs (BF438386, AI732288, AI798733, AW468475, AI473744, AW242160, AI277199, BF216951, R39044, BF002851) share the same 3' end and none extend beyond this point, making it highly likely that this is the most frequently used 3' end of the <italic>RAB27B</italic> mRNA. The other ESTs are; AA659732, AA621327, AA386051, AV749183, AA846320, AA580411, BF245563, BE878236, BF446484, BF246274, BF218405, AI697958, BF245714, BF216086, BF245940, AW340618, H25594, R69522, BF246185, R69389 and BE697849. Most of these ESTs fall within an anonymous 2.586 kb cDNA in Genbank called AF131784 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The sequences from our gs15454, ESTs, AF131784, and AP001910 have been combined to compile a 7.3 kb cDNA, which may represent the complete cDNA for <italic>RAB27B</italic>.

The <italic>RAB27B</italic> gene spans about 69 kb with the untranslated exon 1 separated from exon 2 by 49 kb. Translation terminates approximately 200 bp into the very large exon 6, which is about 6.6 kb in size.</p><p>An EST found in GenBank (BF243879) contains an extra 152 bp of sequence in the 5' UTR, which is not present in the cDNA reported by Chen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. This extra sequence is present in a BAC (accession no. AC007673) and in our P1 clone (gs15454), is probably part of exon 1 and was therefore included in the compiled cDNA sequence. Two kb upstream of the start of transcription (accession no. AC007673) was analysed using MatInspector/TRANSFAC (http://www.hgsc.hcm.tmc.edu). Numerous potential transcription-factor binding sites can be found in the possible promoter region. This region contains 41% of C+G and the promoter prediction by neural network (http://www.hgsc.hcm.tmc.edu) shows three possible promoter sequences (at 13,104; 13,357 and 14,780) and two for the reverse sequence (at 14,546 and 13,542) in the BAC (accession no.

For example, marker WI-8740 has been placed between D18S474 and D18S64 (71.3-83.0 cM) on the GB4 RH map. To confirm the localization obtained by radiation hybrid mapping, we performed FISH analysis using P1 clone gs15454 as a probe on cells from a patient containing a deletion in chromosome 18 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. We observed in all cases only one signal with the <italic>RAB27B</italic> probe while a chromosome 18 centromere probe revealed two signals in almost all metaphases.

Using the Mouse/Hamster Radiation Hybrid panel, we mapped <italic>Rab27b</italic> to chromosome 18 between markers D18Mit33 and D18Mit141, more precisely 5.6 cR from D18Mit33 (lod&#x0003e;3.0).</p><p>A BAC (AP001910) that contains the 3' end of <italic>RAB27B</italic>, also contains an additional gene called CTCL tumor antigen se57-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].

We showed that Rab27a is associated with melanosomes, the specialized pigment-containing organelle in melanocytes. The similarity of Rab27a and b isoforms led us to hypothesize that Rab27a and b isoforms may fulfill similar functions. As a first step to test this possibility, we compared the subcellular location of over-expressed GFP-fusion proteins (EGFP-Rab27a and EGFP-Rab27b) in cultured mouse melanocyte cell line melan-c (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. We found that both EGFP-Rab27a (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>) and EGFP-Rab27b (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref>) exhibit a similar distribution pattern. In particular, both fusion proteins are found to be associated with 0.5 &#x003bc;m cytoplasmic structures distributed at the periphery of melanocytes, often in the dendritic processes. Staining of transfected melan-c cells using antibodies reactive to the melanosome resident protein TRP-1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B,E,H</xref>), revealed a high degree of co-localisation between the proteins, suggesting that the structures containing over-expressed EGFP-Rab27a (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>) and EGFP-Rab27b (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6F</xref>) are melanosomes. Consistent with melanosomal association of Rab27b with melanosomes in melan-c cells, we also observed association of EGFP-Rab27b with pigment granules in the pigmented melanocyte cell line melan-b (data not shown). The specificity of the association of Rab27 isoforms with melanosomes was shown by transient over-expression of EGFP-Rab1a (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6G-I</xref>), EGFP-Rab5, EGFP-Rab6 and EGFP-Rab8 (data not shown) proteins in these cells.

The human <italic>RAB27B</italic> gene is found to consist of 6 exons spread over about 69 kb. The first, non-coding, exon is separated from the others by 49 kb and the end of translation is located within exon 6. This structure is very similar to the human <italic>RAB27A</italic> gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], the exon/intron junctions are present at the equivalent positions and there is high sequence similarity (67% identity at the DNA level and 72% in the protein). It is likely that a duplication event has occurred to generate the two genes encoding the two isoforms of Rab27. Unlike <italic>RAB27A</italic> however, exon 6 in <italic>RAB27B</italic> has a very long (6.4 kb) 3' untranslated region but the significance of this finding is unclear at present.</p><p>The sequence of the human <italic>RAB27B</italic> cDNAs and genomic DNA that we have analysed is found to differ slightly from that previously described by Chen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. One important difference affects the putative translation of the gene as it occurs in the coding region. We found that codon 206 is TTG (leucine) rather than the reported TGG (tryptophan). We sequenced several independent cDNA clones and genomic clones and our sequence matches five ESTs (Genbank AI432357, AW664866, AA812916, AW370404 and BF088963) in the database that overlap in the region where there is disparity with the Chen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] sequence.</p><p>The mouse <italic>rab27b</italic> cDNA shows 89% at the DNA and 95% at the protein level with the human <italic>RAB27B</italic> cDNA. On Northern analysis, the mouse mRNA is only 2.5 kb in size which is considerably smaller than the 8 kb human mRNA. This smaller mRNA size corresponds with the 3' ends determined by a large number of mouse ESTs and is likely due to a much shorter 3' UTR in the mouse compared to the human gene.</p><p>Our expression analysis by RT-PCR suggests that Rab27b is expressed at lower levels than Rab27a. However, the PCR was not done under quantitative conditions and this could be the result of different rates of amplification of the different PCR fragments. On the other hand, both mRNAs were detected at approximately the same levels on Northern blots. Our Northern blots of mouse tissues indicated that mouse Rab27a is expressed in heart, spleen, lung and kidney while Rab27b is expressed in heart, brain, spleen and kidney. This distribution is somewhat different from our RT-PCR results for mouse tissues but this could be due to the presence of contaminating blood in the tissues used for analysis as Rab27 proteins are expressed in haemopoietic cell types. It remains to be established whether Rab27b is expressed in melanocytes. The initial cloning of Rab27b by RT-PCR from human melanoma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] would suggest that it is but our RT-PCR analysis on several melanocyte cell lines proved negative. Future studies with specific antibodies should clarify this issue.</p><p>The sequences of the human and mouse Rab27a and Rab27b genes confirm the extensive similarity between the two proteins. This suggests that these two Rab27 isoforms may be functional homologues which are active in different tissues. One would then expect the two proteins to be targeted to the same intracellular location in the same cells. We decided to study the subcellular localization of Rab27a and Rab27b in melanocytes as we have recently shown a very specific association of Rab27a with melanosomes, the specialised pigment-containing structures in these cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Upon expression of GFP-Rab27 fusion proteins in melanocytes, we found that GFP-Rab27b, like GFP-Rab27a, co-localises to melanosomes. This suggests that, although Rab27b does not seem to be expressed in melan-c cells, it contains targeting determinants as present in Rab27a. However, further experiments are required to test whether there is functional redundancy between the two proteins.</p><p>Mutations in Rab27a in humans (Griscelli Disease) and mice (<italic>ashen</italic>) result in melanosome transport and secretion defects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The lack of phenotype in the other tissues where Rab27a is expressed could be due to functional redundancy between the Rab27a and Rab27b proteins such that there is enough Rab27b in most tissues to complement the lack of Rab27a except in melanocytes where Rab27b was not detectable by RT-PCR.</p><p>We had previously implicated Rab27a in the pathogenesis of Choroideremia (CHM), an X-linked slow-onset retinal degenerative disease resulting from loss-of-function mutations in Rab Escort Protein-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. As the CHM phenotype is very different from Griscelli Disease, it remains unclear whether Rab27a has any role on eye disease. It is unclear at present whether Griscelli patients develop retinal disease as the disease has a poor prognosis and patients don't survive past childhood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Also, the equivalent mutation in mice, <italic>ash</italic> arose in the C3H strain homozygous for the <italic>rd</italic> mutation and all C3H mice are blind a few weeks after birth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. A likely possibility is that both Rab27 isoforms are partially affected in CHM and therefore contribute, possibly with other Rabs to the initiation and propagation of the degenerative process in CHM.</p><p>We show that the human <italic>RAB27B</italic> gene maps to chromosome 18q21.1 by radiation hybrid mapping and FISH. This region of human 18q21.1 is syntenic with two mouse chromosomal regions in chromosomes 1 and 18. As the <italic>leaden</italic> (<italic>ln</italic>) mouse mutant locus maps to mouse chromosome 1 next to <italic>Bcl2</italic> (which maps to 18q21.3 in humans), we investigated whether <italic>Rab27b</italic> could be involved in <italic>ln</italic>. The <italic>ln</italic> mutation attracted our attention because <italic>ln</italic> is phenotypically very similar to <italic>ash,</italic> which is caused by mutations in <italic>Rab27a</italic> and <italic>d,</italic> which is caused by <italic>MyoVa</italic> mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. We therefore hypothesized that Rab27b was a candidate gene for <italic>leaden</italic>. However, the mapping of mouse Rab27b to chromosome 18 suggests that Rab27b is not responsible for <italic>leaden</italic> as <italic>leaden</italic> maps to chromosome 1. If Rab27a and Rab27b are indeed functional homologues, we would expect Rab27b mutations to cause deficiency in lysosomal transport in tissue(s) other than melanocytes where Rab27b, but not Rab27a, is expressed. The studies presented here will aid the future analysis of a possible association of <italic>RAB27B</italic> with human disease.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Isolation of human RAB27B P1 clones</title><p>Two DNA oligonucleotides, 5'-TTCGAAGGCTGACCGACCAAGACCATCACT (primer JA158, sense) and 5'-TATAAACCACACGTTTTTCCCGAAAGTCTA (primer JA169, antisense), both corresponding to the 5' end of the gene, amplified a specific 190 bp fragment from human genomic DNA by PCR.

Melan-c cells were cultured in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 2 mM glutamine, 0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 200 nM phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (Calbiochem), 100 U/ml penicillin G and 100 U/ml streptomycin at 37&#x000b0;C with 10% CO<sub>2</sub>. Cells for immunofluorescence were grown on coverslips for 24 h, transfected using the liposomal transfection reagent Fugene 6 (Roche) and then processed as follows. Transfected cells were washed in PBS, permeabilized for 5 min in 80 mM K PIPES, pH 6.8, 5 mM EGTA, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.05% saponin (in order to remove non-membrane associated fusion protein) and then fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min. Excess fixative was removed by extensive washing in PBS and quenched by incubation in 50 mM NH<sub>4</sub>Cl for 10 min. Fixed cells were then incubated with anti-tyrosinase related protein-1 (TRP-1) monoclonal antibody (ID Labs) diluted 1:50 in buffer (PBS, 0.5% BSA, 0.05% saponin) for 30 min, washed extensively in buffer and incubated for 30 min with Alexa568 conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibodies (Molecular Probes) diluted 1:200 in buffer. Coverslips containing fixed cells were washed as before in buffer, mounted in Immuno Fluor medium (ICN) and observed using a Leica DM-IRBE confocal microscope. The plasmid pEGFP-Rab27b was produced by subcloning of the Rab27b cDNA into the pEGFP-C3 vector (Clontech) downstream of the EGFP ORF. The resulting plasmid encodes a fusion protein containing the Rab27b protein, attached to the carboxyl-terminus of EGFP. The production of other plasmids transfected in this study have been described elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Sequences</title><p>We have deposited the following sequences in Genbank; human <italic>RAB27B</italic> cDNA (accession number AF329499) and mouse <italic>Rab27b</italic> cDNA (accession number AF328893).
