Identification of prognostic molecular markers of the metastatic process is critical for designing therapeutic modalities for reducing the occurrence of metastasis.

Increasing numbers of breast cancer patients are being diagnosed with brain metastases, possibly as a result of the emergence of targeted and aggressive systemic cancer therapy. In overall frequency, breast cancers and lung cancers are by far the most common cancers that metastasize to brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Brain metastasis generally arises in women diagnosed with aggressive breast cancer or in men with advanced lung cancer. The actual incidence of brain metastases is not precisely known, however studies suggest that 6&#x02013;16% of patients with metastatic breast cancer develop brain metastases during their lifetime. Furthermore, autopsy studies have reported brain metastases in 18&#x02013;30% of patients dying ofbreast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The majority of women who develop brain metastases have presented with debilitating neurological symptoms, and have undergone aggressive treatment for stage IV disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Although brain metastasis is the leading cause of breast cancer death, its pathogenesis is poorly understood and the predictors of breast metastasis to brain are yet to be characterized.</p><p>Accumulating evidence suggests that human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) overexpression and consequent trastuzumab (Herceptin)-based therapy might be associated with a higher rate of brain metastases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Retrospective studies in the U.S. in women with HER2 over-expressing breast cancer receiving trastuzumab-based treatment have indicated that approximately one-third of patients had developed brain metastases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Palmeri et al. suggested that HER2 overexpression increases metastatic outgrowth of breast cancer cells in the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], and that HER2 overexpression might be a predictor of asymptomatic, occult brain cancer. Therefore, it is extremely important to study the genetic changes in breast cancer cells that lead to brain metastasis and to develop specific targeted molecular agents. Many genetic aberrations are reported in human breast cancers, including altered splice variants and loss of genomic imprinting. Specifically, altered BK<sub>Ca </sub>channels, which respond to changes in intracellular calcium and membrane potential, are described in a wide variety of tumor cell types. For example, Huang [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] reported that p21<sup>ras </sup>plays a pivotal role in controlling oncogenic transformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], and with its immediate downstream target, Raf kinase, is required for the induction of BK<sub>Ca </sub>channels. Although ubiquitously present in most human organs, the pore forming &#x003b1;-subunit of the BK<sub>Ca </sub>channel is encoded by the <italic>KCNMA1 </italic>gene, and is significantly unregulated and altered in cancer cells. In human glioma cells, up-regulation and constitutive activation of the <italic>KCNMA1 </italic>gene and its alternate splice variants are correlated with increased malignancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Up-regulation of BK<sub>Ca </sub>channels was shown to be a novel mechanism for the malignant phenotype of human tumor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. However, in osteosarcoma, <italic>KCNMA1 </italic>was shown to have antitumor property, suggesting that <italic>KCNMA1 </italic>may have diverse roles in different tumor types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>In the present study, our results from global exon array analysis showed higher expression of <italic>KCNMA1 </italic>in metastatic breast cancers located in brain than in metastatic breast cancers in other organs. This observation prompted us to investigate the potential for invasiveness and brain metastasis of <italic>KCNMA1 </italic>expression in normal breast cells (MCF-10A), non-metastatic breast cancer (MCF-7), non-brain metastatic breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231), and brain specific metastatic breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-361). Our results clearly show that metastatic breast cancer cells exhibit increased BK<sub>Ca </sub>channel activity, leading to greater invasion and transendothelial migration. We showed that the invasion and transendothelial migration of breast cancer cells can be attenuated by blocking BK<sub>Ca </sub>channel activity. Therefore, determining the relative abundance of <italic>KCNMA1 </italic>in breast cancer metastases to brain and understanding its role in brain metastasis may allow us to target <italic>KCNMA1 </italic>for its prognostic and possibly therapeutic potential.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell lines and patient tissue samples</title><p>Established cell lines representing normal breast (MCF-10A), non-metastatic breast cancer (MCF-7, ER positive), non-brain metastatic breast cancer (MDA-MB-231, ER negative), and brain-specific metastatic breast cancer (MDA-MB-361, ER positive) were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and maintained as per ATCC guidelines. The established human brain microvasculature endothelial cell line (HCMEC/D3) of normal brain endothelial phenotype, kindly provided by Dr. Weksler (Weill Medical College, Cornell University, NY), was used to study transendothelial migration of the breast cancer cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Normal breast and breast tumor tissues were obtained from Memorial Health University Medical Center (MHUMC) and Comprehensive Human Tissue Network, University of Alabama according to the protocol approved by MHUMC Institutional Review Board.</p><sec><title>Exon Array</title><p>Total RNA from exponentially growing breast cancer cell lines was extracted and purified using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and RNeasy columns (Qiagen). Single-stranded cDNA was generated from the amplified cRNA with the WT cDNA Synthesis Kit (Affymetrix), fragmented and labeled with the WT Terminal Labeling Kit (Affymetrix). Samples were hybridized with GeneChip Human Exon 1.0 ST Arrays (Affymetrix) and scanned at the Memorial Health University Medical Center Genomics Core Facility. Intensity values were deposited with the GEO database <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo"/> under the accession number GSE17019. Data was subjected to background correction and normalized using Expression Console (Affimetrix). Gene level expression values (probeset intensity analysis) were derived using RMA algorithm using core annotation level for transcripts. Exon array data was further analyzed using Partek Genomic Suite 6.4 software (Partek Inc., St. Louis, MO). Gene-level data was then filtered to include only those probesets that are in the 'core' meta-probe list, which represents RefSeq genes and full-length GenBank mRNAs. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and multi test correction for P-values in Partek Genomic Suite were used to identify differentially expressed genes, using tissue type (primary versus metastatic tissue) as the candidate variable in the ANOVA model to obtain metastatic specific genes.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>RNA extraction and PCR</title><p>Total RNA was extracted from cells which were 75% confluent and from the frozen tissues disrupted using a dounce homogenizer and extracted with TRIzol. The concentration of RNA was determined using a NanoDrop Spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies, USA). cDNA for RT-PCR was generated by the SuperScript&#x02122; First-Strand Synthesis System according to manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). PCR was carried out in a total volume of 20 &#x003bc;l, containing 0.2 mM dNTPs, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2 </sub>and 1 Unit of AmpliTaq Gold DNA Polymerase (Applied Biosystem). Thirty two amplification cycles were performed (Applied Biosystem Thermal Controller), using a denaturing temperature of 95&#x000b0;C for 20 sec, an annealing temperature of 58&#x000b0;C for 30 seconds, and primer extension at 72&#x000b0;C for 20 sec. Each amplification experiment also included two negative PCR controls, a no-RNA control from reverse transcription procedures and a no-cDNA water control. Following amplification, 20 &#x003bc;l of the samples were separated via electrophoresis on a 2% agarose gel. The primers used for amplification of BK<sub>Ca </sub>channel were &#x02013; (5'-TGCAAAGGAG GTTATAAAGTTACG-3' and 5'-ATTTCACAAAAGTTTTCACAAGGAC-3').</p></sec><sec><title>BK<sub>Ca </sub>channel expression and localization in cell lines</title><p>Immunostaining of BK<sub>Ca </sub>channel protein was performed on paraformaldehyde fixed cells, which were permeabilized with 0.05% Triton-X 100 in Phosphate buffer saline (PBS) for 8 min on ice. After washes with PBS, cells were incubated with primary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) diluted 1:400 in PBS containing 1% horse serum, 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA), and 0.05% Triton-X 100 for 30&#x02013;45 minutes at 4&#x000b0;C. Cells were then washed with PBS containing 1% horse serum and 2% BSA, and incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG1 secondary antibody (Sigma) diluted 1:500 in PBS containing 1% horse serum, 2% BSA, and 0.05% Triton-X 100 for 60 min at 4&#x000b0;C. BK<sub>Ca </sub>channel green (FITC) fluorescence was recorded for a minimum of 5,000 events using a Guava flow cytometer. Images for localization of BK<sub>Ca </sub>channel protein were acquired using a Nikon Eclipse TE 2000U inverted microscope fitted with a fluorescence filter for FITC, Photometrics coolsnap HQ2 charge couple device camera, and Metamorph software.</p></sec><sec><title>BK<sub>Ca </sub>channel expression and localization in tumor tissues</title><p>To test immunohistochemical expression of BK<sub>Ca </sub>channel &#x003b1; subunit protein, either fresh-frozen or paraffin-embedded tissues (breast metastasis to brain and one primary breast cancer tissue) were used. Fresh-frozen tumor specimens stored at -80&#x000b0;C were embedded in OCT (Tissue-Tek, Miles Laboratories, Elkhart, IN). Cryostat sections were cut at 10&#x02013;12 &#x003bc;m thickness, mounted on lysine-coated glass slides, and fixed for 10 min at 4&#x000b0;C in 4% formaldehyde. This step was followed by a 5 minute rinse with PBS at pH 7.3. Slides were then blocked in blocking buffer (1% horse serum, 2% BSA, and 0.05% Triton-X 100) for 1 hour at 4&#x000b0;C to decrease nonspecific IgG binding. The sections were next incubated in a humid chamber at 4&#x000b0;C overnight with the primary antibodies, anti-BK<sub>Ca </sub>channel (rabbit) (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA) diluted 1:1000 in blocking buffer, or with PBS as a negative control. After 2 washes with PBS, the slides were stained with anti rabbit FITC conjugated secondary antibody.</p><p>To study BK<sub>Ca </sub>channel immunoreactivity in paraffin-embedded tumor specimens, sections were deparaffinized with three washes in xylene for 5 minutes each followed by rehydration with decreasing concentrations of ethanol. Following this, sections were heated in a water bath (30 minutes at 80&#x000b0;C) in citrate buffer for antigen retrieval. Then, they were washed in phosphate-buffered saline for 10 minutes and incubated with blocking buffer for 1 hour before the slides were incubated overnight at 4&#x000b0;C with the primary antibody rabbit anti-BK<sub>Ca </sub>channel diluted as above in blocking buffer or with PBS as a negative control. After 2 washes with PBS, the localization of BK<sub>Ca </sub>channels in the tissue sections was studied after staining with anti rabbit FITC conjugated secondary antibody.</p><p>Hematoxylin and eosin staining: Cryosections of breast tumors were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and examined by light microscopy.</p></sec><sec><title>siRNA studies</title><p>The functional activity and biological role of <italic>KCNMA1 </italic>in breast cancer cells was studied by transiently knocking down the <italic>KCNMA1 </italic>gene using an Ambion Silencer siRNA transfection II kit. Transfection complexes were prepared in Opti-MEM serum-free medium (Invitrogen) by mixing 0.3 &#x003bc;L of siPORT NeoFX Transfection Reagent (Ambion) and 30 nM of siRNA (silencer pre designed siRNA AM16708A from Ambion). Breast cancer cells (8000 cells/well) were plated in 96-well plates simultaneously with addition of transfection complexes for membrane potential assays while 6-well plates (45,000 cells/well) were used for other studies. Cells were incubated for 72 h, and subsequently used for various assays.</p></sec><sec><title>Membrane Potential Assay</title><p>The functional activity of BK<sub>Ca </sub>channels in breast cancer cells was measured using the FLIPR Membrane Potential Assay Kit on the FLEXstation (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. This kit provided a fast, simple and consistent mix-and read procedure and has the potential to examine the functional characteristics of ion channels using changes in fluorescence. The BK<sub>Ca </sub>channel is one such ion channel, whose activation results in increase of membrane potential due to the opening of a K<sup>+</sup>-permeant, cation-selective channel leading to a decrease in fluorescence. Briefly, the cells were seeded in sterile, clear flat bottom, 96-well plates (Corning Inc., MA) at a density of 4 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4 </sup>cells/well and cultured to achieve a monolayer within 48 hr. The monolayer of cells was incubated with the membrane potential assay reagents for 30 min before loading the test compounds. The anionic potentiometric dye that traverses between cells and extracellular solution in a membrane potential-dependent manner serves as an indicator of voltage changes across the cell membrane. Dose response studies were performed with 0 to 100 &#x003bc;M 1-(5-chloro-2-hydroxyphenyl)-5-trifluoromethyl-1,3-dihydro-2-benzimidazol-2-one (NS-004) (Neurosearch NA, Denmark) with or without Iberiotoxin (IBTX; 10 nM) (Sigma, St. Louis, MO). The FLEXstation was set up using the following parameters: excitation: 530 nm, emission: 565 nm and emission cut off: 550 nm wavelenghs. Observations and recordings were made for 300 seconds after adding NS-004 and IBTX.</p></sec><sec><title>Matrigel Invasion</title><p>BD BioCoat&#x02122; growth factor reduced insert plates (Matrigel&#x02122; Invasion Chamber 12 well plates) were prepared by rehydrating the BD Matrigel&#x02122; matrix coating in the inserts with 0.5 ml of culture medium for two hours at 37&#x000b0;C. The rehydration solution was carefully removed from the inserts, 0.75 ml DMEM containing chemo-attractant (1%FBS) was added to the lower wells of the plate, and 0.5 ml of cell suspension (2.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4 </sup>cells, in serum-free medium containing 0.1%BSA) was added to each insert well. For invasion inhibition assays IBTX (10 nM) was added to the cell culture medium in both upper and lower chambers along with cells and chemo-attractant solution. Cells transiently transfected with siRNA for the <italic>KCNMA1 </italic>gene was also plated to confirm our results obtained with IBTX. Untreated cells were included as migration controls, were used without rehydration. Invasion assay plates were incubated for 20&#x02013;22 hours at 37&#x000b0;C. Following incubation, the non-invading cells were removed by scrubbing the upper surface of the insert. The cells on the lower surface of the insert were stained with crystal violet and each transwell membrane mounted on a microscopic slide for visualization and analysis. The number of tumor cells that had migrated from the upper to the lower side of the filter was counted by an individual blinded for the study using a phase-contrast microscope in the central area of the filter. Data are expressed as the percent invasion through the membrane relative to the migration through the control membrane.</p><p>% invasion = Mean number of treated cells invading through the matrigel insert membrane/Mean number of untreated cells migrating through membrane</p></sec><sec><title>Transendothelial Migration</title><p>The invasion of cancer cells through a monolayer of brain endothelial cells is considered to represent the trans-cellular migration activity of the cancer cells. Basic insights into metastasis to brain have been obtained through experiments using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). However, endothelial cells from different vascular beds are uniquely adapted to meet the demands of the underlying tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], and data from HUVECs are not directly applicable to breast tumor cell interaction with endothelial cells at the blood brain barrier (BBB). In this regard, differences between HBMVECs (human brain microvscular endothelial cells) and HUVECs have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. We therefore used HCMEC/D3 cells, which are derived from human brain microvasculature to study transendothelial migration of breast tumor cells to brain. HCMEC/D3 cells were seeded at a density of 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5 </sup>cells/dish on 35-mm plastic culture dishes coated with collagen and allowed to grow for 4 days to form a confluent monolayer. After the monolayer of HCMEC/D3 has been rinsed once with fresh culture medium, NS-004, IBTX and siRNA- treated breast cancer cells were seeded on top of the HCMEC/D3 at a density of 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4 </sup>cells/dish. Following co-incubation for 16 hourat 37&#x000b0;C, non-adherent cells were removed by aspiration and the remaining cell layer was fixed in 10% formalin in PBS. The number of cancer cells that had penetrated the monolayer as well as cancer cell colonies (collectively called invasion foci) was counted under a phase-contrast microscope in 16 different visual fields. Data were expressed as percentage migration of treated breast cancer cells compared with migration of untreated controls, presumably metastatic to brain since the cancer cells were co-cultured with human brain microvascular endothelial cells.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Exon array and PCR</title><p>The data obtained by the GeneChip Exon array (Affymetrix) demonstrated that the <italic>KCNMA1 </italic>gene was over-expressed in breast cancer cell lines derived from human breast cancer metastases to brain (MDA-MB-361) as compared to metastatic breast cancer cells derived from systemic organs (MDA-MB-231) or primary breast cancer (MCF-7) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).

We performed membrane potential studies to determine whether the overexpressed BK<sub>Ca </sub>channels show increased functional activity using the FLIPR Membrane Potential Assay kit on the FLEX station. Hyperpolarization is reflected as decrease in fluorescence at 565 nm. A specific BK<sub>Ca </sub>channel activator, NS-004, was added to the cells in a dose-dependent manner, and an optimum concentration of 50 &#x003bc;M was established (data not shown), for further studies. All the four breast cancer cell lines listed above showed hyperpolarization after the addition of NS-004 and the effect lasted for more than 300 seconds. The hyperpolarizing action of NS-004 was most marked in MDA-MB-361 cell lines (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) compared to other breast cancer cell lines. These results demonstrate that BK<sub>Ca </sub>channels in MDA-MB-361 and other breast cancer cell lines were functional. IBTX (10 nM), a BK<sub>Ca </sub>channel antagonist, blocked the membrane hyperpolarization in all the breast cancer cells tested. In addition, transient silencing of functional BK<sub>Ca </sub>channels by siRNA was performed. After testing different concentrations of siRNA (10&#x02013;75 nM) 30 nM was determined to be optimum (&#x0003e;30 nM was toxic to cells, data not shown). Exposure of the breast cancer cells lines to 30 nM siRNA inhibited NS-004 induced activity of BK<sub>Ca </sub>channels by 65&#x02013;70% in MCF-10A and MCF-7, and 75&#x02013;85% reduction MDA-MB-231 and MDA-MB-361 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, dark bars). These data indicate that BK<sub>Ca </sub>channel activity is functionally distinct in the four breast cancer cell lines studied, being highest in the line that metastasizes preferentially to brain, and can be silenced by a specific BK<sub>Ca </sub>channel inhibitor such as IBTX or by treatment with siRNA.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Differential BK<sub>Ca </sub>channel activity measured by membrane potential in breast cancer cell lines</bold>.

Therefore, we studied the effect of increased activity of BK<sub>Ca </sub>channels on the invasion of breast cancer cells into Matrigel-coated membranes in a Transwell chamber. No invasion was observed with MCF-10A cells, while MDA-MB-361 cells were more invasive than MCF-7 or MDA-MB-231 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). Interestingly the enhanced invasiveness of MDA-MB-361 cells was inhibited by only 50% by IBTX while invasion of MCF-7 was inhibited by 80% by IBTX (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>) suggesting that BK<sub>Ca </sub>channels may play a greater role in the invasion of MCF-7 cells. Furthermore, treating cells with siRNA that targeted the <italic>KCNMA1 </italic>gene inhibited the invasion of breast cancer cell lines to a similar extent as did treating them with IBTX (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>).

Tumor metastasis is a clonally selective process that occurs as part of tumor progression, a concept that has been supported by experimental [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and clinical research. Generally, breast cancer metastasis is the hallmark of an aggressive tumor, resistant to treatment. Molecular factors that may contribute to organ-specific metastasis of breast cancer to lung and bone have been identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. However, it is not clear how and why certain patients with primary breast cancers develop brain metastases, while in other patients tumors remain confined to the primary sites. Recent investigations in patients with metastatic lung and breast cancers reported alarming rates of brain metastases in both instances. For example, among metastatic breast cancer patients with HER2 positive tumors, the incidence of brain metastases varied from 26% to 48% (8&#x02013;12). The brain and its supporting structures represent a unique environment for metastatic growth. Molecular factors contributing to the survival of tumor cells in metastatic lesions may be organ specific and could further influence the tumor cells with respect to their gene and protein expression, growth dynamics, and non-responsiveness to treatment. Unraveling the mechanism that drives the metastatic machinery in these cancer cells may offer insights into how to limit or potentially prevent this lethal process.</p><p>We showed that the biochemical opening of BTB with BK<sub>Ca </sub>channel modulators increases the BTB permeability and enhance delivery of hydrophilic therapeutic drugs or small- to large-sized molecules, anti-tumor compounds, therapeutic proteins and viral vectors <italic>in vivo </italic>to brain tumors selectively with little or no drug delivery to normal brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>Increasingly, targeted molecular therapy is gaining popularity, especially the use of humanized monoclonal antibodies. Although targeting oncogenes expressed on tumor cells is one viable cancer treatment strategy, oncologists often need to target additional molecules related to tumor stroma that promote tumor metastasis and growth. We used gene expression profile study to identify increased <italic>KCNMA1 </italic>expression in a breast cancer cell line metastatic to brain (MDA-MB-361) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) as compared to expression in a primary, breast cancer cell line (MCF-7) or breast cancer cell line metastatic to other organs (MDA-MB-231) of the body but not to brain. Others have shown an up-regulation of BK<sub>Ca </sub>channels as a novel mechanism for producing the malignant phenotype of human tumor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Our results clearly demonstrate that the <italic>KCNMA1 </italic>is upregulated in the MDA-MB-361 cell line (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). RT-PCR data (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) from tumor tissues and from breast cancer cell lines further supported these findings, suggesting a close association between level of BK<sub>Ca </sub>channel expression and metastasis to brain. In agreement with the PCR results on breast cancer cell lines, immunocytochemistry results showed strong expression of BK<sub>Ca </sub>channels in MDA-MB-361 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>) as compared to MCF-10A cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). The presence of the BK<sub>Ca </sub>channel protein was also confirmed using flow cytometry (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). The immuno staining of the sections from human breast cancer tissue indicated that BK<sub>Ca </sub>channel protein expression was pervasive in metastatic brain tumors (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C:c</xref>) compared to primary cancers and those metastatic to other organs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C:a&#x00026;b</xref>). In addition, we showed that BK<sub>Ca </sub>channel is pharmacologically functional by knocking down the <italic>KCNMA1 </italic>gene with siRNA, which has led to a decrease in activity (drop in fluorescence) in all the cell lines studied (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). The BK<sub>Ca </sub>channel activation was 3-fold higher in breast cancer cells metastatic to brain (MDA-MB-361) than in normal breast cells (MCF-10A) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). These results confirm higher expression of BK<sub>Ca </sub>channels on brain specific metastatic breast cells (MDA-MB-361) than in normal breast cells and non-brain metastatic breast cancer cells (MDA-MB-231). These findings corroborate the immunostaining data (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>) and are consistent with our previous studies showing overexpression of BK<sub>Ca </sub>channels in gliomas and in endothelial cells surrounding malignant brain tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Other investigators have also demonstrated over expression of BK<sub>Ca </sub>channels to correlate with increased malignancy of human gliomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Other type of K<sup>+ </sup>channel (KCNK9) was also shown to have oncogenic properties in breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Taken together our data suggest that there may be an association between BK<sub>Ca </sub>channel overexpression and breast cancer metastasis to brain.</p><p>The most recent electrophysiological information about BK<sub>Ca </sub>channels came from studies on vertebrate cells with the patch clamp [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. The cDNAs of BK<sub>Ca </sub>channels have been cloned, and its 7-transmembrane topology has been identified. The N-terminus of BK<sub>Ca </sub>channels is in the extracellular space because an additional transmembrane segment called S0 precedes the canonical S1 through S6 transmembrane segments. With fixed level of intracellular Ca<sup>2+ </sup>[Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>, BK<sub>Ca </sub>channels behave like delayed-rectifier K<sup>+ </sup>channels, activating with depolarization where the gating rates and the resulting probability of being open are also sensitive functions of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>.</p><p>Various therapeutic suggestions have been made by investigators based on genome-wide expression analysis of breast cancers, such as adjusting the intensity of current chemotherapy based on cancer subtypes as defined by gene expression signatures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Unfortunately, because a large number of genes with many diverse functions are identified as prognostic signatures, the lists of genes may yield excellent prognostic markers without revealing much of the underlying biological mechanisms thereby providing little guidance for a course of action. In contrast our study showed that inhibition of BK<sub>Ca </sub>channels using either a siRNA or specific chemical inhibitor significantly reduces <italic>in vitro </italic>the invasive capability of the breast cancer cell lines (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). This finding further requires validation in biological tumor models. Surprisingly the decrease in the invasive capability of MCF-7 following the addition of BK<sub>Ca </sub>channel inhibitor IBTX was greater than that observed in MDA-MB-361 cells. One possible explanation could be that MDA-MB-361 cells are HER2 positive, which may induce the breast cancer cells to metastasize to brain. Furthermore, HER2 expression may skew the BK<sub>Ca </sub>channel induced invasiveness of MDA-MB-361 cells, while MCF-7 (HER2 negative) cells may depend predominantly on BK<sub>Ca </sub>channels for invasion.</p><p>The unique properties of the brain may explain the propensity of certain breast cancer cells to metastasize to the brain. Specifically the brain vascular endothelial cells forming the BBB are significantly different from the systemic endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. A key event in brain metastasis is TEM of breast cancer cells. We examined whether inhibition of BK<sub>Ca </sub>channels expressed in breast cancer cells metastatic to brain, prevents TEM of MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, and MDA-MB-361 cells across the monolayer of HCMEC/D3 cells. As anticipated, targeting <italic>KCNMA1 </italic>with siRNA or BK<sub>Ca </sub>channels with IBTX significantly decreased the TEM of MCF-7, MDA-MB-231, and MDA-MB-361 cells across the monolayer of HCMEC/D3 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Most importantly a normal breast cell line (MCF-10A) did not exhibit TEM even when the BK<sub>Ca </sub>channels were activated with NS-004 (data not shown). Our data suggest that increased TEM, at least in part, requires increased BK<sub>Ca </sub>channel expression and/or activity. Thus, blocking BK<sub>Ca </sub>channel function potentially may delay or prevent breast cancer metastasis to the brain. In summary, we showed that BK<sub>Ca </sub>channels are overexpressed in breast cancer cells metastatic to brain. The high expression level correlated with BK<sub>Ca </sub>channel activity, invasion and TEM of the breast cancer cells metastatic to brain.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Tumor metastasis is a complex and highly regulated process involving multiple tumor-host interactions.
