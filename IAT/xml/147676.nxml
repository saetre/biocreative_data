We have now cloned the cDNA for this gene from both human and mouse and show that it is a highly conserved novel member of the recA / RAD51 recombination repair gene family. The cDNA is able to complement significantly the phenotype of a unique cell line, irs1 , which shows extreme sensitivity to DNA cross-linking agents and genetic instability. Thisphenotype is consistent with a role for the XRCC2 gene in recombination repair in somatic cells, suggesting that in addition to RAD51 , other members of this gene family have an important function in high fidelity repair processes in mammals. Despite this function, the XRCC2 gene transcript is expressed at a very low level in somatic tissue, but is elevated in mouse testis, suggesting an additional role in meiosis.</p></abstract></article-meta></front></article>
