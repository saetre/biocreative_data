Further analysis revealed that the latter two interact with each other, indicating that Rv1417, Rv2617c and Erp are connected through multiple interactions. While Rv1417 is disseminated in several <italic>Actinomycetales </italic>genera, orthologues of Rv2617c are exclusively present in members of the <italic>M. tuberculosis </italic>complex (MTC). The central and amino-terminal regions of Erp were determined to be involved in the interaction with Rv1417 and Rv2627c. Erp forms from <italic>Mycobacterium smegmatis </italic>and <italic>Mycobacterium leprae </italic>were not able to interact with Rv2617c in two-hybrid assays.

The central segment has 11 PGLTS repeats, four of which match exactly with the consensus and seven are degenerate. The export signal sequence consists in four charged aa followed by 14 nonpolar ones and a probable cleavage site for the signal peptidase. Erp and P36 have been detected only in culture supernatants and cell wall preparations, but not in cell extracts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>De Mendo&#x000e7;a et al. have demonstrated that orthologues of the <italic>erp </italic>gene are also present in saprophytic and environmental opportunistic pathogenic mycobacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. A striking feature of this family is that it has no orthologous sequences outside the <italic>Mycobacterium </italic>genus. Thus, it can be considered a <italic>Mycobacterium</italic>-specific family of secreted proteins.</p><p>Although the precise roles of Erp proteins have remained elusive, the number of reports showing that Erp is a crucial factor for survival and multiplication of bacteria both <italic>in vitro </italic>and in animal models is increasing. The initial evidence supporting a role of the Erp protein in mycobacterial pathogenesis came from a study by Berthet <italic>et al</italic>., who demonstrated that the disruption of <italic>erp</italic>/<italic>p36 </italic>in both <italic>M. tuberculosis </italic>and <italic>M. bovis </italic>BCG negatively affects the multiplication of these strains in infected cultured bone marrow-derived macrophages and mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. In agreement with these results, disruption of <italic>p36</italic>, impairs the growth of virulent <italic>M. bovis in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Finally, it has been reported that <italic>erp</italic>-deficient <italic>Mycobacterium marinum </italic>has an attenuated growth in cultured macrophage monolayers and during chronic granulomatous infection of leopard frogs, its natural host species. These results suggest that the function of Erp is similarly required for the virulence of <italic>Mycobacterium </italic>species other than those belonging to the MTC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. It has also been shown that <italic>erp</italic>-deficient bacteria are attenuated primarily because of reduced intracellular growth and/or survival in macrophages from zebrafish embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Thus, these findings reinforce the notion of Erp as a virulence factor of pathogenic mycobacteria. However, the exact function of this virulence factor during host infection is still unknown.</p><p>Because Erp has several central repeat regions, we hypothesized that these regions participate in the interaction with other proteins. In order to gain insights into the function of Erp, and based on the premise that the function of unknown proteins may be discovered through their interaction with a protein target with a known function, we searched for Erp-binding proteins from <italic>M. tuberculosis </italic>by using a bacterial two-hybrid system. We here report that Rv1417 and Rv2617c were able to interact with Erp and that these proteins relate to each other through multiple interactions. In addition, important aspects of the association of Erp with mycobacterial virulence are discussed.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>1. The Erp protein interacts with Rv1417 and Rv2617c in a bacterial two-hybrid system</title><p>We used a two-hybrid system developed by Ladant and co-workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], in which genes of interest are fused to T18 and T25, two complementary fragments that are essential for adenylate cyclase activity. If the corresponding fusion proteins interact, cAMP is produced in an endogenous adenylate cyclase-deficient <italic>E. coli </italic>strain (BTH101), and this functional complementation can be easily monitored by plating bacteria in minimal medium supplemented with lactose. In this work, we searched for Erp-binding proteins by screening an <italic>M. tuberculosis </italic>DNA expression library with full-length Erp using this bacterial two-hybrid system. The size of the library was approximately 10<sup>5 </sup>clones. Out of 6 &#x000d7; 10<sup>3 </sup>plated transformants, 10 <italic>cya</italic>+ clones which could grow in minimal medium supplemented with lactose were selected, indicating ten potential interactions. Enzymatic restriction analysis revealed that clones were unique (data not shown). In order to confirm the interactions and to exclude "false positives", plasmids were purified and used to retransform <italic>E. coli </italic>BTH101. In this second round, only three plasmid clones whose products were able to confer adenylate cyclase activity in <italic>E. coli </italic>BTH101 co-transformed with plasmid T25-Erp were selected. Sequence analysis of inserts revealed that two of these plasmids encoded Rv1417 and one Rv2617c. The plasmids encoding Rv1417 had a complete copy of the gene and they differed only in the length of the 5' region upstream of <italic>Rv1417</italic>, while in the plasmid encoding Rv2617c the first 60 bp of the gene were absent. Rv1417 and Rv2617c were annotated as membrane proteins, both of unknown function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. All sequenced fragments were in-frame with the ORF encoding T18. The fact that both plasmids encoding Rv1417 were independent clones confirms that non-redundant clones were present in the genomic library and reinforces the feasibility of Erp-Rv1417 protein interaction.</p><p>In order to examine the protein-protein interactions mentioned above, <italic>erp</italic>, <italic>Rv1417 </italic>and <italic>Rv2617c </italic>full-length genes were fused to both T18 and T25 gene sequences in pUT18c and pKT25 vectors, respectively. The efficiencies of functional complementation between hybrid proteins were determined by the number of colonies grown in M63 medium supplemented with lactose, and by &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). The level of interaction between Erp and both Rv1417 and Rv2617c was significantly higher than that of the negative controls, independently of the adenylate cyclase fragments (T25 or T18) these proteins were fused to (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). These interactions were confirmed by <italic>in vitro </italic>GST-Pull down assays (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold><italic>In vivo </italic>interaction of Erp, Rv1417 and Rv2617c</bold>. <italic>E. coli </italic>BTH 101 cells were transformed with the plasmids described in the figure and plated in M63 medium supplemented with lactose.

Rv1417 and Rv2617c interact with each other</title><p>The binding of Erp to two different proteins raised the question whether these two proteins are able to interact with each other. In order to clarify this point, the binding between Rv1417 and Rv2617c was addressed by using the bacterial two-hybrid system. These experiments were facilitated by the availability of constructs with each gene in both vectors that had been prepared for the present work. Plasmids (encoding protein fusions of Rv1417 and Rv2617c with T25 and T18 polypeptides) were used to transform <italic>E. coli </italic>BTH101 cells. All plasmid combinations were subjected to a quantitative screening on selective medium plates. Each hybrid protein tested was able to associate with the other partners (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). Indeed, both Rv1417 and Rv2617c exhibited strong self-associations, thus suggesting homodimer complex formation of these proteins (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>). The Erp fusions, however, were impaired in self-association (data not shown). None of the hybrid proteins gave a significant complementation signal when tested either with control T25 and T18 polypeptides or with unrelated proteins, like lipoprotein P27 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>3. The carboxy-terminal domain of Erp is not relevant for protein interactions</title><p>In an effort to map the Erp region involved in protein-protein interactions, we assessed the capacity of each Erp domain to bind both Rv1417 and Rv2617c. Firstly, we focused on determining whether the carboxy-terminal region of Erp, which is involved in the association with the cell wall [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], contained a binding domain. The full sequence of the <italic>erp </italic>gene was divided in two regions at the base number 528, and fusions of both regions to the T18 encoding sequence were generated. The resulting hybrid proteins were then tested in two-hybrid complementation assays with Rv1417 and Rv2617c fused to the T25 fragment. Deletion of the carboxy-terminal region of Erp did not affect its association with Rv1417 and Rv2617c, thus suggesting that this region of the protein is not essential for this interaction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Mapping of the Erp interacting domain</bold>. The experiment was performed as in Fig. 1.

When separated, the amino-terminal and the central domains were unable to interact with Rv1417 and Rv2617c (data not shown). Only the protein deleted in the carboxy-terminal region showed a level of interaction comparable to, or even higher than, that of the full-length protein.</p></sec><sec><title>4. Interaction of Erp members from <italic>Mycobacterium smegmatis </italic>and <italic>Mycobacterium leprae</italic></title><p>As mentioned in the introduction section of this work, Erp carboxy- and amino-terminal domains are fully conserved, while the central region shows polymoprhism among mycobacterial species, with respect to the number and quality of repeats. While <italic>M. leprae </italic>has four repeats, <italic>M. smegmatis </italic>has twenty-six, half of which contain two mismatches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Therefore, it was plausible that the interaction with Rv1417 and Rv2617c was affected by the number of repeats. In order to evaluate this assumption, the interaction of <italic>M. smegmatis </italic>and <italic>M. leprae </italic>Erp homologues with both Rv1417 and Rv2617c was assayed. <italic>M. leprae </italic>Erp (Ml Erp) was unable to associate with either Rv1417 or Rv2617c. <italic>M. smegmatis </italic>Erp (Ms Erp) showed interaction with Rv1417 but completely failed to bind Rv2617c (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Although we can not exclude the possibility that the lack of interaction of Rv1417 and Rv2617c with the Erp member from <italic>M. leprae </italic>was due to a misfolding of the T25-Ml Erp protein, the impossibility of this fusion protein and of the T25-Ms Erp protein to interact with Rv2617c is interesting since it correlates with the absence of a functional <italic>Rv2617c </italic>gene in the <italic>M. leprae </italic>and <italic>M. smegmatis </italic>genomes (see below). On the other hand, the interaction of Rv1417 with the Erp member of <italic>M. smegmatis</italic>, but not with the one from <italic>M. leprae</italic>, indicates that the number and sequences of the PGLTS repeats are relevant for the occurrence of such interaction.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Interaction of Erp members from <italic>M. smegmatis </italic>and <italic>M. leprae </italic>with Rv1417 and Rv2617c</bold>.

Erp, Rv1417 and Rv2617c are located in close proximity</title><p>In order to determine the localization of the potential protein complex Erp-Rv1416-Rv2617c in mycobacterial cells, we first performed an <italic>in silico </italic>search for protein domains in Rv1417 and Rv2617c. Sequence analysis with InterProScan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] recognized a signal-peptide domain in Rv1417 and Rv2617c. However, this was not confirmed by SOSUI or SignalP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], two different software programs that perform signal peptide predictions. Both SOSUI and TMHMM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] predicted the presence of two and three transmembrane helices for Rv1417 and Rv2617c, respectively. The analysis performed with the SOSUI server showed two transmembrane helices (encompassing positions: 22&#x02013;44 and 51&#x02013;72) in Rv1417 and three transmembrane helices (encompassing positions: 19&#x02013;41, 81&#x02013;103 and 117&#x02013;139) in Rv2617c. TMHMM predicted that the probability of an extracellular location for the C-terminal region of Rv1417 was 0.36 and 0.64 for a cytosolic orientation. The predicted probability for an outward orientation for the C-terminus of Rv2617c was approximately 0.82. These results indicate a probable membrane localization of these proteins. To confirm these predictions, we performed immunolocalization of the proteins in subcellular compartments and in culture supernatants by using specific antibodies. Rv1417 and Rv2617c were expressed as a fusion to the myc epitope (see Materials and Methods) to allow their detection in mycobacterial cells. Since attempts to detect Rv1417-Myc in <italic>M. tuberculosis </italic>were unsuccessful, probably due to a very low expression of the recombinant protein, the fused protein was expressed in the <italic>M. smegmatis </italic>strain mc<sup>2 </sup>155.

Therefore, the co-localization of Rv1417 and Rv2617c suggests that protein-protein associations may take place in the cell envelope. In agreement with previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], Erp was identified in the cellular wall fraction and culture supernatant of <italic>M. tuberculosis </italic>by using a monoclonal specific antibody [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].

While examination of the genomic location of the <italic>Rv2617c </italic>and its orthologues did not reveal any particular feature, we found that Rv1417 and its orthologues are upstream flanked by genes encoding for proteins involved in riboflavin synthesis. Riboflavin operons with a similar structure, containing an <italic>Rv1417</italic>-like gene, were identified in all <italic>Mycobacterium </italic>species whose genomes were sequenced, as well as in other species of <italic>Actinomycetales </italic>genera (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>). In addition, RibX, whose gene is a putative member of the riboflavin operon of <italic>C. ammoniagenes</italic>, showed similarity to Rv1417 (E = e<sup>-22</sup>).

Here we present findings that could contribute to decipher the function of Erp in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>. The construction of a two-hybrid library expressing <italic>M. tuberculosis </italic>proteins enabled us to identify two Erp interacting proteins, Rv1417 and Rv2617c. We found that Rv1417 and Rv2617c are similar to hypothetical membrane proteins from other bacterial species but not to characterized proteins.</p><p>By BLAST searches, we identified Rv1417 orthologues in several mycobacterial species, including <italic>M. smegmatis </italic>and <italic>M. leprae</italic>. The presence of Rv2617c seems to be restricted to the <italic>M. tuberculosis </italic>complex, as no functional orthologues were identified in non-tuberculous species while <italic>Rv2617c </italic>genes were found by PCR in <italic>Mycobacterium microti</italic>, <italic>Mycobacterium pinnipedii, Mycobacterium canetti </italic>and <italic>M. bovis </italic>genomes.</p><p>By protein-protein interactions we also demonstrated association between Rv1417 and Rv2617c. Importantly, in all cases, complementation between the T25 and the T18 hybrids was detected in both configurations, that is, when the given proteins were fused to either the T25 or the T18 polypeptides. Moreover, both Rv1417 and Rv2617c, but not Erp, showed self-interaction, indicating that the former are able to generate homodimers. Taken together, these results show that it is likely that the three proteins form a heteromultimeric protein complex.</p><p>However, at this point of the investigation we do not know whether more than two units of Rv1417 and Rv2617c are assembled in the putative multi-protein complex.</p><p>Since the signal sequence of Erp was present in the T25 and T18 fusions, we cannot rule out the possibility that interacting proteins are localized in the periplasm of <italic>E. coli</italic>. However, based on the fact that the bacterial two-hybrid system allows the detection of protein interactions that occur either in the cytoplasm or at the inner-membrane level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], this possibility is very unlikely.</p><p>Kocincova et al. have shown that the Erp protein is anchored to the surface of the bacterium by a carboxy-terminal hydrophobic domain and that it is easily released into the supernatant fraction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. From these data these authors proposed that Erp uses the carboxy-terminal domain to interact with some other molecules of the cell wall to achieve its correct structure. This finding led us to think that Rv1417 and Rv2617c might have the potential to anchor Erp by interaction with its carboxy-terminal domain. Nevertheless, here we demonstrated that this domain does not contribute to the interactions, thus suggesting that the membrane proteins Rv1417 and Rv2617c are not involved in the attachment of Erp to the cell surface. Remarkably, it has been demonstrated that the carboxy-terminal region of Erp is not essential for restoring the virulence and tissue damage of an <italic>erp</italic>-mutant strain of <italic>M. tuberculosis </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Therefore, based on the facts that this carboxy-terminal region, which is conserved through <italic>Mycobacterium </italic>species, is not implicated in protein interaction or virulence, one may speculate that the virulence properties of Erp are related with its capability of interaction. We found that the region involved in the interaction with Rv1417 and Rv2617c was located in the amino-terminal and central domains of Erp. However, we do not know whether the interactive domains are mapped at the central repetitive region and the amino-terminal region is relevant for protein folding, contributing to the protein association, or whether additional binding domains are present at the amino-terminal region.</p><p>The interaction of Rv1417 and Rv2617c with the repeat central domain of Erp is intriguing because this domain appears to be associated with a role in virulence and tissue damage of <italic>M. tuberculosis </italic>in mice. Recently, de Mendo&#x000e7;a -Lima et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] have shown that at early time-points of infection in lungs, Erp from <italic>M</italic>. <italic>smegmatis </italic>is not able to restore the wild type virulence of the <italic>erp</italic>-deficient <italic>M. tuberculosis </italic>strain, whereas Erp from pathogenic <italic>M. leprae </italic>induces a hypervirulent phenotype. In this work, we demonstrated that Erp from <italic>M. leprae </italic>(ML0091) was not able to interact either with Rv1417 or with Rv2617c, and that Erp from <italic>M. smegmatis </italic>(MSMEG6405) was able to interact with Rv1417 but not with Rv2617c. The absence of Rv2617c in species that do not belong to the MTC and the inability of both ML0091 and MSMEG6405 to interact with Rv2617c indicate that the Rv2617c-Erp interaction is restricted to species from the MTC. These interactions may have been acquired during divergent evolution when tuberculous <italic>Mycobacterium </italic>species arose. Thus, this work provides evidence suggesting multiple roles for members of the Erp family, which could explain why, being relevant for intracellular living, this proteins are present in saprophytic <italic>Mycobacterium </italic>species. On the other hand, the interaction of Rv1417 with the Erp member from <italic>M. smegmatis </italic>but not with the one from <italic>M. leprae </italic>suggests that the virulence role played by Erp orthologues is not related with their capacities of interaction with Rv1417. The investigation of such interactions in a variety of mycobacterial species will help to clarify this point.</p><p>Although the pairwise interactions of Rv1417, Rv2617c and Erp were clearly demonstrated, they may reflect a transient contact in an assembly pathway or stable interactions in a completed structure. In order to define this point, immunolocalization of the three proteins in the bacterial cell was investigated. In agreement with previous findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], Erp was localized mostly in culture supernatants, but also associated to the cell wall, whereas Rv1417 and Rv2617c were restricted to the cell membrane. This last finding is in agreement with the prediction of transmembrane helices in both Rv1417 and Rv2617c as determined by SOSUI and TMHMM software. An initial scan with InterProScan predicted a signal-peptide domain in these proteins that could not be confirmed neither by the specialized SOSUI nor by the SignalP programs. This is not unexpected since mycobacterial exported proteins without predicted signal sequences have been previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Therefore, we postulate that Rv1417 and Rv2617c form a multimeric structure on the membrane which is, in turn, transiently associated to the Erp protein before being translocated to the cell envelope and the extracellular compartment. Although the experiments carried out in this study did not allow us to define whether Rv1417 and Rv2617c are localized in the cytoplasmic membrane or in the outer membrane, the former localization appears more plausible since these proteins are not predicted to be present in the outer membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>Our work shows that both Rv1417 and Rv2617c genes are transcribed in <italic>in vitro </italic>cultured <italic>M. tuberculosis </italic>and that <italic>Rv1417 </italic>is co-transcribed with the <italic>RibH </italic>gene, which is part of a riboflavin operon. We also found that <italic>Rv1417 </italic>orthologues are located in genomic regions that encode proteins that participate in the riboflavin metabolism in several species of <italic>Actinomycetales</italic>. Riboflavin (vitamin B2) is the precursor of the coenzymes flavin mononucleotide phosphate and flavin adenine dinucleotide phosphate, essential compounds for basic metabolism. It has been demonstrated that riboflavin biosynthesis is essential for <italic>in vivo </italic>survival of a number of bacterial species because of the scarcity of riboflavin in mammalian cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Although these findings strongly suggest a role of Rv1417 in riboflavin synthesis, more research is necessary to understand the association of riboflavin metabolism with the function of Erp and Rv2617c in <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic>, as well as to elucidate the biological significance of the protein interactions discovered in this study.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We identified interactive partners of Erp, an <italic>M. tuberculosis </italic>protein involved in virulence, which will be the focus of future investigation to decipher the function of the Erp family protein.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Bacterial strains and culture media</title><p>All cloning steps were performed in <italic>E. coli </italic>DH5&#x003b1;, and <italic>E. coli </italic>BL21(DE3) was used for recombinant protein production.

Recombinant plasmids were used to transform <italic>M. tuberculosis </italic>H37Rv and <italic>M. smegmatis </italic>competent cells as described above. Subcellular fractioning of <italic>Mycobacterium </italic>strains was performed as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Western blots</title><p>Western blot assays were performed as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] with the following antibodies: anti-P36/Erp Mab (1:500) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] and anti-myc monoclonal antibody (1:100/Sigma-Aldrich). Alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (1:2000/Sigma-Aldrich) was used to detect anti-myc and anti-P36/Erp antibodies.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>LIK carried out the molecular biology and protein studies and participated in the draft of the manuscript.
