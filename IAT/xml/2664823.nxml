Some essential genes have been identified in the early stage of adenohypophysial development, such as PITX1, FGF8, BMP4 and SF-1. However, it is likely that a large number of signaling molecules and transcription factors essential for determination and terminal differentiation of specific cell types remain unidentified. High-throughput methods such as microarray analysis may facilitate the measurement of gene transcriptional levels, while Expressed sequence tag (EST) sequencing, an efficient method for gene discovery and expression level analysis, may no-redundantly help to understand gene expression patterns during development.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 9,271 ESTs were generated from both fetal and adult pituitaries, and assigned into 961 gene/EST clusters in fetal and 2,747 in adult pituitary by homology analysis. The transcription maps derived from these data indicated that developmentally relevant genes, such as Sox4, ST13 and ZNF185, were dominant in the cDNA library of fetal pituitary, while hormones and hormone-associated genes, such as GH1, GH2, POMC, LH&#x003b2;, CHGA and CHGB, were dominant in adult pituitary. Furthermore, by using RT-PCR and <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization, Sox4 was found to be one of the main transcription factors expressed in fetal pituitary for the first time. It was expressed at least at E12.5, but decreased after E17.5. In addition, 40 novel ESTs were identified specifically in this tissue.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The significant changes in gene expression in both tissues suggest a distinct and dynamic switch between embryonic and adult pituitaries. All these data along with Sox4 should be confirmed to further understand the community of multiple signaling pathways that act as a cooperative network that regulates maturation of the pituitary. It was also suggested that EST sequencing is an efficient means of gene discovery.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The pituitary is well known as one of the most important glands in the endocrine system, and secretes hormones that orchestrate many physiological processes such as growth, sexual development, metabolism and the stress response. It contains three lobes and is of dual embryonic origin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The posterior lobe is of neuroectodermal origin while the anterior and intermediate lobes are of ectodermal origin. The anterior pituitary gland consists of five cell types: somatotrophs [producing growth hormone (GH)], lactotrophs [producing prolactin (PRL)], gonadotrophs [producing luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH)], thyrotrophs [producing thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH)], and corticotrophs [producing adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), proteolytically cleaved from proopiomelanocortin (POMC)]. Melanotrophs [producing melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH)], proteolytically cleaved from POMC are the sixth hormone-producing cell type, but these are situated within the intermediate lobe. During embryonic development, the six specific cell types arise from Rathke's pouch (RP), and form the anterior and intermediate lobes under the control of various mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>In the past several years, most aspects of pituitary development have been extensively explored, because of the relatively simple structure of the gland and its critical role in the neuroendocrine system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. According to the structural changes and cell-type-specific occurrence, development and differentiation of the pituitary can be divided into three major stages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The onset of pituitary organogenesis is marked by a striking restriction of Shh, BMP4, FGF8 and Wnt5a, which are uniformly expressed in the oral ectoderm from the invaginating RP. In murine embryos, this is formed around E9.0, which results in a molecular boundary in the oral ectoderm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The second phase of pituitary development appears to involve BMP2, Wnt4, and Prop1 expression, which participate in the progression from organ commitment to cell-type determination that occurs between E10 and E12. At this time, the RP extends dorsally and expands to form a flattened epithelium close to the infundibular recess of the diencephalon. Hes1 and Hes5 have been identified to play a role in controlling the progenitor pool, intermediate lobe specification, and posterior lobe formation during pituitary development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Terminal differentiation of the hormone-secreting cells occurs after E12 and is marked by the expression of LH and FSH in gonadotrophs, GH in somatotrophs, and PRL in lactotrophs. Transcription factors like Prop1, TBX19, Gata2 and POU1F1 are necessary for the terminal differentiation events and cell-type-specific gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Three recent studies using cDNA microarray have been carried out to profile gene expression pattern during pituitary development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Many genes, such as carboxypeptidase E (CPE), stathmin (STMN1), endothelin type A receptor (EDNRA), dual-specificity phosphatase 1 (DUSP1), FGF2, FGF4, ZHX1B, DUSP3 and Sox10, were newly identified as being involved in the determination and cell-type-specific gene expression of the six mature endocrine cell types. It has been suggested that a large number of signaling molecules and transcription factors essential for pituitary development remain unclear, especially at the end of differentiation. All these large-scale studies were carried out based on neuroendocrine-system-specific cDNA microarrays. In addition, it is necessary to point out that the understanding of pituitary development and the regulatory programs that control hormone expression have been mostly derived from animal experiments, in particular mice and chickens. Accumulating evidence has implied that there are vital differences in gene expression profiles between development in mice and humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Until now, there has been a lack of information from expressed sequence tag (EST) libraries of human fetal pituitary.</p><p>For a comprehensive insight into the molecular mechanisms involved in human pituitary development, we used a relatively large number of ESTs to investigate the differentially expressed genes/ESTs in fetal and adult pituitaries. In addition to data from microarrays, the EST data reported herein will lead to an additional understanding of human pituitary development and hormone expression.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>General characteristics of ESTs derived from human pituitaries</title><p>To profile the gene expression of fetal pituitary, 4,172 clones from the cDNA library were randomly selected and sequenced from the 5' end. After removing rRNA, as well as repetitive, mitochondrial and ambiguous sequences, 3,394 (81.4%) high-quality ESTs were obtained and further analyzed. Assembling of all available ESTs generated 961 cluster sets including 774 singleton (did not cluster with anything else) and 187 non-singleton clusters. They were deposited GenBank in NCBI with accession numbers: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="CD236662">CD236662</ext-link>&#x02013;<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="CD240055">CD240055</ext-link>. The average cluster contained 3.53 sequences. Of which, 757 (78.7%) and 123 (12.8%) were matched known genes and ESTs, respectively. The remaining 82 (8.5%) were considered as novel ESTs, because they did not match with any known genes or ESTs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). The previous 5,877 ESTs that we generated from adult pituitary glands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] were analyzed again and grouped into 2,747 clusters. Of which, 2,594 (87.0%), 344 (11.5%) and 45 (1.5%) were respectively identified as known genes, known ESTs and unique ESTs found only in the pituitary cDNA libraries (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Although a total of 3,539 EST clusters were derived from human pituitaries, only 169 (4.8%) genes or ESTs were shared in both cDNA resources, which suggested that there might have been a significant switch of pituitary functions during development because of the differential gene expression profiles between fetal and adult pituitaries (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Homologous analysis of EST clusters from human pituitaries</bold>.

suppression of tumorigenicity 13 (ST13) and fucosyltransferase 2, were highly expressed in fetal pituitary, which implies that these genes are involved in pituitary development.

Also, GA-bingding protein transcription factor (GABP), hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1), and transcription factor DP3 (TFDP3) were presented in the fetal pituitary EST library.</p></sec><sec><title>Expression pattern of Sox4</title><p>There were eight (0.24%) transcripts for Sox4 in the fetal pituitary ESTs, but none was found in the adult pituitary cDNA library. The expression pattern of Sox4 during pituitary development was confirmed by semi-quantitative RT-PCR of human samples. The transcript level of Sox4 was much higher in fetal pituitary but was reduced to a very low level in adult pituitary (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). At the same time, the transcription levels of GH, PRL, POMC, TSH, FSH, LH, CGA and CART (cocaine and amphetamine regulated transcript) were increased in adult samples. To further address the issue, we examined expression of Sox4 in E12.5, E14.5 and E17.5 mouse embryos and in adult pituitary using <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization. On E12.5, Sox4 was expressed in the pituitary at modest levels in the infundibulum and RP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). By E14.5, Sox4 expression was most abundant in the undifferentiated cells of the anterior, intermediate and posterior lobes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>), but significantly decreased at E17.5 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). In adults, the pituitary is fully differentiated and contains all of the hormone-secreting cell lineages.

To establish potential functions, the tissue expression patterns of 40 selected novel ESTs were evaluated by semi-quantitative RT-PCR (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Most of these ESTs were expressed in a limited manner in certain tissues, and not ubiquitously in all 10 tissues examined. Interestingly, some transcripts, such as CD239423, CD239425, CD238497 and CD238482, were highly expressed in pituitary glands and testes. Meanwhile, some ESTs, such as CD237004, CD236818 and CD237414 were specifically expressed in the brain, in addition to the pituitary. The expression of CD237004, CD238497 and CD239425 was further confirmed by <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization with human fetal pituitary tissues (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>).

With the advance of the human genome project, a large amount of genomic information is now available for surveying the physiological and pathological processes of humans at a global level. Hormonal genomics has been proposed to develop postgenomic approaches substituting gene-by-gene ones to reveal the subfamilies and pathways for genes involved in the hormones signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The functional subgenomes of secreted extracellular signaling molecules, transmembrane receptors, intracellular signaling molecules, and transcriptional factors can now be analyzed in an integrated manner. Of which, EST sequencing, series analysis of gene expression (SAGE) and cDNA microarray or gene chip analysis are the most efficient strategies for profiling gene expression at the transcriptome level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>In this study, a total of 3,539 EST clusters were derived from 9,271 ESTs generated from cDNA libraries of human fetal and adult pituitaries. It was not as high as expected because of the limited number of human samples. We did confirm the information by semi-quantitative RT-PCR, <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization or reviewing previous studies. Aside from semi-quantitative RT-PCR in this study, microarray analysis and quantitative RT-PCR carried out in our previous study also showed that the expression level of hormones, such as TSH&#x003b2;, POMC and GH in fetus, were relative lower than that in adult [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. On the other hand, some genes such as EDNRA, were highly expressed in fetal pituitary, also in agreement with previous study performed by Dr. Ellestad using microarray [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Although these studies were all to highlight the gene expression profile of pituitary, there is only few genes overlapped between these screens. Most of the variations could be caused by methods different.</p><p>The partial transcription maps derived from these ESTs indicated that hormones and hormone-associated genes were predominant in adult pituitary, while development-associated genes were predominant in fetal pituitary, including Sox4 and ST13. Sox4 has been shown to be functionally involved in development of a wide range of tissues and cells, such as heart, B cells, reproductive system and central nervous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. ST13 may facilitate the chaperone function of Hsc/Hsp70 in protein folding and repair, and in controlling the activity of regulatory proteins such as steroid receptors and regulators of proliferation or apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. POU1F1, necessary for cell lineage of thyrotrophs, somatotrophs and lactotrophs, was hit once in the cDNA library of fetal pituitary. No significant different of its expression level could be detected between fetal and adult pituitary. It is in agreement with that POU1F1 is necessary but not sufficient for hormones gene activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p><p>It was revealed for the first time that Sox4, a member of the SRY-like high-mobility group (HMG) box gene family, was one of the most abundant mRNAs in the fetal pituitary. The HMG box defines a superfamily of eukaryotic DNA-binding proteins of central importance in mammalian gene regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], and SRY defines the mammalian testis-determining factor encoded by the Y chromosome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Sox protein is a specific HMG-box factor that is similar to SRY. It is ubiquitous in the animal kingdom and is involved in diverse developmental processes, including germ layer formation, cell type specification, and organogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Sox4 null mice die during embryogenesis because of failure of endocardial ridge development, and blocking of B-cell lineage progression at the stage of pro-B-lymphocyte expansion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p><p>Explanted fetal thymic organ cultures (FTOCs) of Sox-4-deficient thymus yielded 10&#x02013;50-fold fewer CD4/CD8 double-positive and single-positive cells than FTOCs of littermates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Lioubinski <italic>et al </italic>have reported that Sox4 is expressed in insulin-producing pancreas islets, and co-expressed with glucagon during tissue development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Also, it has been reported that Sox4 is expressed in the mouse uterus under ovarian hormone control. This suggests a developmental role for this gene in the female reproductive system, because its expression always appears to be related to the maturational stage of the cell population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Furthermore, Cheung <italic>et al </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] showed that Sox4 might indeed had another functional role in brain development. It has been demonstrated that Sox4 expression counteracts differentiation of radial glia and has to be down-regulated before full maturation can occur in the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Radial glia with prolonged expression of Sox4 fail to migrate to the position normally assumed by Bergmann glia, and do not extend radial fibers toward the pial surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. The expression pattern of Sox4 in pituitary development suggests that it is involved in pituitary cell differentiation; similar to its role in facilitating thymocyte differentiation, but it normally prevents premature differentiation of human pituitary.</p><p>In addition, we investigated the expression of 17 members of the Sox gene family in the fetal human pituitary using RT-PCR. Eleven of these members (Sox 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 12, 13, 15 and 17) were detected (data not shown). It has recently been reported that Sox2 had a critical role in the development of the hypothalamo-pituitary axis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], and deletion of Sox3 can lead to abnormal development of RP and defects in pituitary function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Sox10 might be necessary for gonadotropin-releasing hormone cell differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Obviously, members of the Sox gene family might have a predominant role in the regulation of hypothalamus-pituitary axis formation.</p><p>Except for the genes known to be associated with pituitary development, our data suggest that some other genes are involved in the differentiation and maturation of human pituitary. They contained genes for cytokines and their receptors, transcription factors, and those involved in the cell cycle, DNA replication and signal transduction. Of which, GA-binding protein transcription factor is a critical and functionally relevant Ets factor that regulates rPRL promoter activity via the BTE site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. HIF-1 exerts an antiapoptotic role in HP75 in hypoxia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. TFDP3 was identified in pituitary for the first time, and only highly espressed in human testis, thymus and fetal pituitary according to our studies (data not show). It was reported as an inhibitor of E2F-induced apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>].</p><p>40 novel ESTs were produced in human fetal pituitary. They are all singletons which no EST was matched in a BLAST against the nonredundant EST database at NCBI. It is suggested that they are potential new genes, proteins and microRNAs that need to be investigated in the future. For example, CD239423 was located on Human DNA sequence from clone RP11-123K19 on chromosome 9, jointed by 13118&#x02013;13292, 26649&#x02013;26703, 29319&#x02013;29386, and 39381&#x02013;39729. The others such as CD239425, CD238497, CD237004 and CD238482 were found to reside in the introns of various genes. And their tissue expression patterns show that some novel ESTs exist particularly in fetal pituitary cells. It is indicated that EST sequencing is an efficient method for gene discovery and expression level analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, the transcriptome approaches used in this study indicate some novel clues in human pituitary development. Of these, Sox4 and some novel ESTs are suggested to have important roles in pituitary development. Thus, the EST data was effective for identifying a comprehensive gene expression profile. It may lay the foundation for further investigation of the molecular mechanisms of human pituitary development and function.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Specimens</title><p>Two male fetal pituitaries were obtained from 16-week-old human fetuses, which were aborted accidentally without genetic, immunologic and infections diseases.
