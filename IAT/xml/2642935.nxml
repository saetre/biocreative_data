Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase that plays key roles in transmitting ECM signals by integrins. In this study, we delineated patterns of FAK expression and tyrosine phosphorylation (Y<sup>397</sup>) in the developing lens and investigated its regulation by FGF2. We also examined FAK expression and activation during disrupted fiber differentiation in mice expressing a dominant-negative TGF&#x003b2; receptor.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>FAK expression and activation (phosphorylation on Y<sup>397</sup>) was studied in embryonic and postnatal rodent lenses by in situ hybridization, immunofluorescence, and western blotting. Rat lens explants were used to investigate the effects of FGF2 on FAK expression and activation. Immunofluorescence and western blotting were used to examine FAK expression and phosphorylation in transgenic mice that express a dominant-negative TGF&#x003b2; receptor.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>FAK is widely expressed and phosphorylated during embryonic stages of lens morphogenesis and differentiation. However, in postnatal lenses its expression and activation becomes restricted to the posterior germinative zone and the transitional zone at the lens equator. While both NH<sub>2</sub>- and COOH-terminal antibodies revealed cytoplasmic and membrane-associated staining in lens cells, the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal antibody also showed FAK was present in fiber cell nuclei. In vitro, FAK expression and phosphorylation on Y<sup>397</sup> were increased by concentrations of FGF2 that initiate lens epithelial cell migration (10 ng/ml) and differentiation (50 ng/ml) but not proliferation (5 ng/ml). Moreover, reactivity for Y<sup>397</sup>phosphorylated FAK is prominent in the nuclei of differentiating fibers both in vivo and in vitro. Disruption of TGF&#x003b2;-like signals by ectopic expression of a dominant-negative TGF&#x003b2; receptor (T&#x003b2;RII<sup>D/N</sup>) results in abnormal lens fiber differentiation in transgenic mice. While FAK expression is initiated normally in the posterior germinative zone of T&#x003b2;RII<sup>D/N</sup> transgenic lenses, as fiber differentiation proceeds, FAK becomes localized to a perinuclear compartment, decreases its association with the cytoskeleton and is poorly phosphorylated on Y<sup>397</sup>.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>FAK is widely expressed and activated during early lens morphogenesis. During secondary lens fiber differentiation, FAK is expressed and phosphorylated on Y<sup>397</sup> as epithelial cells exit the cell cycle, initiate migration at the equator, and undergo differentiation in the transitional zone. During terminal fiber differentiation an NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal fragment of FAK, including Y<sup>397</sup>, is translocated to the nucleus. The expression, activation, and nuclear localization of FAK are regulated, at least partly, by FGF2. FAK activity and subcellular localization are also modulated by TGF&#x003b2;-like signals. In fiber cells of T&#x003b2;RII<sup>D/N</sup> transgenic lenses, FAK is abnormally retained in a perinuclear compartment, loses its association with the cytoskeleton, and is poorly phosphorylated. These data suggest that integrin signaling via FAK plays important roles during lens differentiation, mediated by FGFs and TGF&#x003b2;-superfamily signals.</p></sec></abstract><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>GalleyStatus</meta-name><meta-value>Export to XML</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-wrap></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Lens development involves an intricate network of regulatory genes and interplay between growth factor and extracellular matrix (ECM) signaling pathways. Lens morphogenesis is initiated by a series of inductive interactions, culminating in contact between the neuroepithelium of the presumptive retina (optic vesicles) and the presumptive lens ectoderm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>]. Upon contact with the optic vesicles, the lens ectoderm thickens to form a placode that subsequently invaginates to form a vesicle. The anterior vesicle cells proliferate and form the lens epithelium, whereas the posterior cells (facing the optic cup) undergo extensive elongation and differentiation to form primary lens fibers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>]. During fetal and postnatal development, cell proliferation becomes increasingly localized to a band of epithelial cells above the lens equator, the germinative zone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>]. As the lens grows, progeny of these divisions move below the equator, into the transitional zone, where they elongate and differentiate into secondary lens fibers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>]. Terminal fiber differentiation is characterized by the abrupt loss of nuclei and organelles from the cortical fibers by an apoptotic or autophagic mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>].</p><p>Several growth factor signaling pathways have been implicated in regulating lens development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>]. In particular, FGFs have been shown to regulate the patterns of cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation in the lens, leading to its highly polarized structure. FGFs are the principal inducers of fiber differentiation, but other factors, notably members of the TGF&#x003b2; superfamily, have been shown to be required for fiber elongation and terminal differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>]. More recently, the family of Wnt growth factors has been implicated at various stages of lens induction and differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>].</p><p>During lens morphogenesis, the ectodermal basement membrane that surrounds the lens vesicle thickens to form the lens capsule. It is composed of laminin, heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG), SPARC, entactin/nidogen, fibronectin, and collagen IV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>]. The lens capsule has been shown to modulate, and to be modulated by, growth factors. For example, the capsule sequesters FGFs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>] and different regions of the capsule have different proliferative effects on lens epithelial cells due to different presentation of FGF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>]. Conversely, inappropriate stimulation of the lens epithelium by TGF&#x003b2; results in dramatic changes in the expression of ECM proteins such as laminins, fibronectin, HSPG, and collagens I and III, which accompany the epithelial to mesenchymal transition, characteristic of subcapsular cataract [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>]. Similarly, alteration in composition of the lens capsule, such as occurs in the SPARC-null mutant mouse, results in dramatic changes in lens transparency and gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r30">30</xref>], indicating that the ECM of the lens capsule is an important regulator of cellular processes in the lens.</p><p>Integrins are cell surface receptors for ECM proteins, such as laminin, fibronectin, and collagen, which mediate cell adhesion and modulate growth factor signaling. Integrins are composed of non-covalently associated, heterodimeric transmembrane polypeptides (&#x003b1;- and &#x003b2;-subunits) that are involved in bidirectional signaling ("inside-out" and "outside-in") [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref>]. Intracellular signals, often as a result of growth factor signals, affect integrin activity on the surface by initiating conformational changes that expose ligand binding sites. ECM ligand binding subsequently leads to the assembly of multiprotein complexes in association with the integrin cytoplasmic tails. These complexes link to the actin cytoskeleton and include kinases that modulate many intracellular signaling pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">33</xref>].</p><p>Recent studies have shown that the lens expresses the laminin binding integrins &#x003b1;3&#x003b2;1, &#x003b1;6A&#x003b2;1, and &#x003b1;6B&#x003b2;1 in patterns suggestive of distinct roles in lens development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r34">34</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r36">36</xref>]. Moreover, the integrins are differentially regulated, with &#x003b1;6 splice variant expression being regulated by FGF and &#x003b1;3 expression being regulated by an unidentified factor in vitreous [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r36">36</xref>]. Integrins are required at various stages of lens development (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r37">37</xref>]). Injection of antibodies or RGD peptides into the preoptic regions of chick embryos, to block integrin function, results in a failure of eye morphogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r38">38</xref>]. Double null mutation of &#x003b1;3 and &#x003b1;6 integrin genes results in abnormalities of the anterior lens epithelium during embryonic development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r39">39</xref>]. However, how integrin signaling affects lens cell processes is not well understood.</p><p>Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is a protein tyrosine kinase involved in "outside-in" integrin signaling and plays important roles during cell migration and proliferation in both normal and transformed cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r41">41</xref>]. FAK becomes rapidly phosphorylated by integrin engagement of ECM ligands or by growth factor signals. Activation of FAK at focal adhesions promotes cell motility, enhances cell survival, increases cell proliferation via the MAPK pathway, and is associated with differentiation of several cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r43">43</xref>]. FAK consists of large NH<sub>2</sub>- and COOH-terminal domains, which flank an internal catalytic region. The NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal FERM (protein 4.1. ezrin, radixin, moesin homology) domain interacts with integrins and receptor tyrosine kinases. The COOH-terminal domain contains the FAT (focal adhesion targeting) domain that acts as a binding site for focal adhesion proteins (particularly paxillin and talin) and two proline-rich regions that act as binding sites for SH<sub>3</sub> domain-containing proteins. The COOH-terminal noncatalytic region is also expressed independently, from an alternative intron-located promoter, as a variant of FAK called FRNK (FAK-related non-kinase) and is thought to act as a dominant-negative inhibitor. FAK contains six known sites of tyrosine phosphorylation, which are associated with various activities of FAK. The major and best characterized phosphorylation site is tyrosine-397 (Y<sup>397</sup>), located just upstream of the kinase domain. Phosphorylated Y<sup>397</sup> is a binding site for a number of SH<sub>2</sub> domain-containing proteins, including the Src family kinases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r41">41</xref>] and binding triggers Src activation. Activated Src can then induce further phosphorylation of other FAK tyrosine residues, resulting in maximal activation of FAK and generation of binding sites for various other adaptor proteins such as Grb2, which can activate the MAPK pathway. Other proteins with SH<sub>2</sub> sites that can bind to Y<sup>397</sup> include PI3 kinase, PLC&#x003b3;, and Grb7. This autophosphorylation promotes the initiation of FAK-related signaling complexes at focal adhesion sites. Conversely, displacing FAK from focal adhesions inhibits its tyrosine phosphorylation, impairing its function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r41">41</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we delineate the expression and activation of FAK in the developing lens and investigate its regulation by FGF. We also examine whether FAK expression or activation is altered in lenses of mice with disrupted terminal fiber differentiation due to ectopic expression of a dominant-negative TGF&#x003b2; receptor. The results suggest that FAK plays important roles during lens differentiation, particularly as cells exit the cell cycle in the germinative zone and initiate fiber differentiation in the transitional zone. During lens fiber differentiation, FAK expression and phosphorylation are modulated by FGF2 and phosphorylated FAK or a FAK NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal fragment is targeted to the nucleus. In fibers undergoing abnormal terminal differentiation due to expression of T&#x003b2;RII<sup>D/N</sup>, FAK is abnormally targeted within the cell, becomes disassociated from the cytoskeleton and is poorly phosphorylated.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Tissues</title><p>All animal procedures were performed in accordance with the Association for Research and Ophthalmology (ARVO) Statement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Vision Research and were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of the University of Melbourne.</p><p>Ocular embryonic (E) and post-natal (P) tissues were obtained from Wistar rats and from wild-type (FVB/N) and T&#x003b2;RII<sup>D/N</sup> transgenic (OVE591) mice.

Transgenic mice were identified by PCR of SV40 transgene sequences from genomic DNA as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>]. Embryonic (E) tissues were collected from super-ovulated (5 IU Folligon; 5 IU Chorulon, Intervet, Sydney, NSW Australia) pregnant females euthanized on days E11.5, E13.5, E14.5, and E17.5. Postnatal eyes were obtained from euthanized neonatal (P1-3) and weanling (P21) animals. Tissues were used for tissue culture, protein extraction or were fixed overnight in 10% neutral buffered formalin (NBF), transferred to 70% ethanol and embedded in paraffin.</p></sec><sec><title>Lens epithelial explants</title><p>Lens epithelial explants were prepared from P9-14 Sprague Dawley or Wistar rats and cultured in Medium 199 (Thermo-Trace, Noble Park, VIC, Australia) with or without recombinant human FGF2 (0-50 ng/ml; PeproTech, Rocky Hill, NJ) as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r36">36</xref>] for up to 8 days.

A 485 bp fragment encoding a region just 5' of the kinase domain was generated from a full length cDNA clone (ATCC; 63207), using primers 5'-GCT GAT CCA GCA AAC ATT CA-3' and 5'-TGC CTT GCT TTT CAC TGT TG-3' and designated the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal probe. A 1,166 bp fragment that corresponds to the COOH-terminal domain was generated by RT-PCR from total RNA isolated from FVB E14.5 embryos, using primers 5'-GCT CTA GAC AAT CCT GGA GGA GGA GAA GG-3' and 5'CTT CCT CGC TGC TGG TGG AAT TCT TGA GA-3' and designated the COOH-terminal probe. The cDNA fragments were separated on a 1% agarose gel and were gel purified using a gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Doncaster, VIC Australia) and cloned into the pGEM-T vector (Promega, Sydney NSW, Australia). Clones were sequenced and found to be 100% homologous with published FAK sequences.</p><p>In situ hybridization was performed on formalin-fixed paraffin sections (6 &#x003bc;m) using DIG-labeled riboprobes as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r44">44</xref>]. Briefly, sections were hybridized (55 &#x000b0;C) overnight with DIG-labeled sense or antisense transcripts (200 ng/ml) and washed with increasing stringency (6X-0.1X SSC) over a period of 2 h. Hybridization signal was visualized by incubation with anti-DIG antibody (1:1,000) conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (AP) and histochemical detection with NBT/BCIP (Roche Diagnostics, Castle Hill, NSW Australia), according to the manufacturer's instructions.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunofluorescence</title><p>To localize FAK in ocular tissues, formalin-fixed paraffin embedded sections (6 &#x003bc;m) were dewaxed and rehydrated to water. Antigen retrieval was carried out by immersing sections in hot (60 &#x000b0;C) 0.01 M citrate buffer, heating for 5 min on high in a microwave, followed by 5 min at a lowered temperature setting to maintain the solution at or near boiling. Tissues were cooled to room temperature, equilibrated in phosphate buffered saline with 0.1% bovine serum albumin (PBS/BSA) for 10 min and blocked in PBS/BSA with 3% normal goat serum (Sigma-Aldrich, Castle Hill, NSW, Australia) for 30 min prior to incubation with the primary antibody (2-5 &#x003bc;g/ml). The primary antibodies used were a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against a peptide at the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminus of FAK (SC557; Santa Cruz, Santa Cruz, CA), a rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against peptide at the COOH-terminus of FAK (SC558; Santa Cruz) and a mouse monoclonal antibody for phospho-Y<sup>397</sup> FAK (MAB1144; Chemicon, Boronia, VIC, Australia). Reactivity was detected using AlexaFluor-488 conjugated anti-rabbit or anti-mouse secondary IgG (Molecular Probes/Invitrogen, Mt Waverley, VIC, Australia) diluted 1:500 in PBS/BSA at room temperature for 1-2 h. Following rinses in PBS/BSA, sections were stained with 1 &#x003bc;g/ml Hoechst dye (Sigma-Aldrich) to label nuclei, and mounted using DAKO fluorescent mounting medium (DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark). Control sections were incubated with nonimmune rabbit IgG or with the antibody pre-adsorbed with the corresponding peptide (SC558P or SC557P; Santa Cruz). Experiments were also carried out with antibody preadsorbed with a mixture of bovine &#x003b1;-, &#x003b2;-, and &#x003b3;-crystallins (kindly provided by Prof Bob Augusteyn), to ensure the antibodies did not cross-react nonspecifically with the abundant crystallins. Results were visualized and captured using a Zeiss Axioskop-2 Plus microscope/Axiovision II software (Zeiss, Nth Ryde, NSW, Australia).</p><p>To localize FAK in cultured lens cells, epithelial explants were rinsed in PBS, fixed in 10% NBF or 4% paraformaldehyde with 0.2% Triton-X for 10 min, and washed in PBS. Samples were then blocked and incubated with antibody as described above. Nuclei were counterstained either with 1 &#x003bc;g/ml Hoechst dye or with 1 &#x003bc;g/ml propidium iodide for 5 min, washed in phosphate buffer, and then mounted for standard or confocal fluorescence microscopy as described above.</p></sec><sec><title>Western blotting</title><p>Whole lenses from neonatal FVB and transgenic (OVE 591) or rat lens epithelial explants (untrimmed) were homogenized in extraction buffer (50 mM HEPES, 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1% Triton-X, 50 mM sodium fluoride, 10 mM sodium phosphate, 10% protease, and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails [Sigma-Aldrich]). Following extraction, total protein of lens and explant extracts were quantified using the Bio-Rad Protein assay reagent (Bio-Rad, Regents Park, NSW, Australia). Equal amounts of protein for each sample were separated on 8-10% SDS-PAGE gels (Bio-Rad), under reducing conditions. Protein molecular weight marker (Kaleidoscope prestained standards, Bio-Rad) and positive control lysates from Jurkat cells (Chemicon) were included in each electrophoretic separation. Separated proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, blocked in 3% BSA in PBS with 0.1% Tween (PBST) for 1 h at room temperature and incubated with primary antibody (1 mg/ml in PBST) overnight at 4 &#x000b0;C. Membranes were washed in PBST and incubated for 1.5 h with the appropriate HRP-conjugated secondary anti-mouse or rabbit IgG (Bio-Rad), diluted 1:5000-1:10000. After washing with PBST, antibody binding was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Amersham Biosciences/GE Healthcare, Rydalmere, NSW, Australia). To control for non-specific binding, immunoglobulin isotype control experiments were run in parallel.</p><p>To investigate the association of FAK with the cytoskeleton in epithelial and fiber cells, P9 rat lenses were dissected into epithelium (including lens capsule) and fiber preparations as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r36">36</xref>]. This involved tearing the posterior capsule at the posterior pole with fine forceps and removing the capsule, with epithelial cells attached, from the fiber mass. To ensure no contamination with adherent fibers or fiber fragments, the lens explants were trimmed to remove the posterior capsule and peripheral epithelial regions. The dissected tissues were rinsed in PBS and extracted in fresh RIPA buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% deoxycholate, 1% Triton X-100, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 10 mM Tris pH7.4), containing a protease inhibitor cocktail (1 tablet/10 ml RIPA buffer; Roche Diagnostics) and additionally 1 mg/ml PMSF, leupeptin, aprotinin, and pepstatin A (Sigma-Aldrich). Extraction was performed using three rapid freeze-thaw cycles, using alternate liquid nitrogen and ice baths, and grinding using eppendorf pestles (Astral Scientific, Gymea NSW, Australia). The lysate was allowed to stand on ice for 30 min and then centrifuged at 800x g for 5 min. The supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 13,000x g at 4 &#x000b0;C for 30 min. The supernatants were collected and pellets were resuspended in fresh RIPA buffer. Protein concentrations were determined for all samples by the Micro BCA assay (Pierce, Paddington, QLD, Australia) and equal amounts of protein (6-10 &#x003bc;g) were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE gels under nonreducing or reducing conditions before transfer at 4 &#x000b0;C for 2 h onto Immobilon-PVDF membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA) using a transblot apparatus (Bio-Rad). Blots were washed in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween-20 (TBST), blocked overnight in 3% BSA (Sigma-Aldrich) in TBST and incubated overnight with FAK antibodies (SC557, SC558) as described above. Antibody reactivity was detected by chemiluminescence as described above.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>FAK mRNA is expressed throughout lens development</title><p>To determine the spatio-temporal expression of FAK mRNA expression during lens morphogenesis, in situ hybridization was carried out using probes directed to the 5' and 3' regions of the FAK coding domain.

As the lens matures and these processes slow, FAK becomes restricted to cells exiting the cell cycle in the germinative zone, undergoing migration at the equator and differentiation in the transitional zone. Since FGFs are major regulators of cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>], we examined whether FAK expression is regulated by FGF. Exposure of lens epithelial explants to a fiber differentiating dose (100 ng/ml) of FGF2 induced a gradual increase in the expression of FAK-pY<sup>397</sup> from 24 h to 6 days of culture. After 1 h of FGF2 exposure, only occasional cells showed significant reactivity for FAK-pY<sup>397</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4A</xref>), similar to control explants (not shown). However, after 24 h, there was a marked increase in the amount of reactivity for FAK-pY<sup>397</sup> in explants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4B</xref>). Reactivity was at the membrane surface and appeared to be consistent with increased formation of focal adhesions. After 48 h of FGF2 exposure, cells became more elongated in shape and appeared to be more migratory. There is also evidence of mitosis.

FAK is distinctly localized in the invaginating lens pit and optic cup as well as in the proliferating anterior epithelial cells and in differentiating fibers during the rapid phase of lens growth (E14.5-P1). However, as the lens matures postnatally, FAK expression becomes more restricted. In the lens epithelium of weanling mice, FAK expression is absent from the relatively quiescent anterior cells, but is initiated in the posterior germinative zone, where epithelial cells exit the cell cycle, and is maintained in the transitional zone, where cells commence elongation and fiber differentiation. Thus FAK is expressed in regions of the lens where cells exit the cell cycle, migrate, and differentiate.</p><p>An antibody directed to the major phosphorylated form of FAK (pY<sup>397</sup>-FAK) revealed similar patterns of FAK activity, with active FAK present throughout the embryonic lens. As the lens matures, it becomes more restricted to the equatorial region, where cells exit the cell cycle, migrate, and differentiate. Consistent with this spatial pattern, FGF stimulated increased FAK expression and phosphorylation at concentrations that induce cells to migrate and differentiate but not at concentrations that stimulate cell proliferation. The pattern of pY<sup>397</sup>-FAK expression in the lens is very similar to the pattern of phosphorylated Src [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r46">46</xref>]. Src can be recruited into a complex with FAK once FAK is phosphorylated on Y<sup>397</sup> and subsequently Src mediates phosphorylation of FAK at other tyrosine residues, thus ensuring complete activation of FAK and permitting binding of other proteins and kinases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r40">40</xref>]. In lens cells, Src activity has been shown to regulate the transition from proliferation and differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r47">47</xref>], as well as Na, K-ATPase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r48">48</xref>] and induction of cataracts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r49">49</xref>]. While Src and FAK are coordinately regulated during differentiation of pigmented epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r50">50</xref>], it is not known how FAK and Src modulate each other in the lens.</p><p>While all three antibodies showed localization of FAK in the cytoplasm and in association with cell membranes, the NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal and pY<sup>397</sup>-FAK antibodies also revealed punctate nuclear reactivity in differentiating fibers. This was particularly evident with the pY<sup>397</sup>-FAK antibody. Moreover, in vitro experiments indicate that epithelial cells induced to differentiate with FGF2 also accumulated pY<sup>397</sup>-FAK reactivity in the nuclei, suggesting that this phenomenon is regulated by FGF. The fact that this accumulation did not occur in all cells of FGF-treated explants indicates that other factors may also be involved.</p><p>The presence of NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal FAK fragments in the nucleus has been detected in other cell types undergoing apoptosis and it has been proposed that they have signaling functions during apoptosis and cell adhesion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r51">51</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r54">54</xref>]. Cleavage of FAK, to yield both COOH-terminal and NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal fragments in apoptotic cells, has been shown to be mediated by caspase-3, giving rise to various fragments from 55-90 kDa, depending on the species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r55">55</xref>]. The presence of similar fragment sizes (60-100 kDa) in lens extracts as well as nuclear aggregates of FAK reactivity in cortical lens fibers, coincident with regions of caspase-3 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r56">56</xref>], suggest that there is similar cleavage of FAK by caspase-3 and accumulation of NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal FAK fragments in the lens fiber nucleus during differentiation.</p><p>While cleavage of FAK is thought to be a mechanism to regulate its activity in adhesion junctions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r40">40</xref>], the role of FAK in the nucleus is still unclear. Jones et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r51">51</xref>] showed that transfection of glioblastoma cells with an NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal FAK fragment increased nuclear FAK accumulation but did not induce increased apoptosis and concluded that NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal FAK is not, by itself, proapoptotic and that nuclear accumulation is a response to an apoptotic stimulus. By contrast, overexpression of a COOH-terminal FAK fragment does induce apoptosis, presumably by competing with intact FAK in adhesion junctions and by attenuating EGFR signaling. In the lens, FAK expression, activation, and accumulation of nuclear FAK aggregates is induced by FGF, suggesting that FAK may act as the integration point between growth factor and ECM signals during fiber differentiation. In normal lens development, terminal fiber cell differentiation involves loss of nuclei and organelles by a modified apoptotic mechanism, whereby the cell cytoplasm and membranes remain intact [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>]. As FAK is known to mediate survival signals, it is plausible that the balance of full-length FAK and COOH-terminal fragments in adhesion complexes plays a role in regulating apoptosis to ensure denucleation without cytoplasmic blebbing of fibers. However, such a role for FAK in fibers will need to be investigated further by mutational strategies, designed to alter the ratio of FAK and COOH-terminal fragments during fiber differentiation.</p><p>Terminal fiber differentiation requires signaling by TGF&#x003b2; family members. Inhibition of BMP signals by extracellular antagonists or by dominant negative receptors inhibits lens fiber cell elongation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>]. Ectopic expression of a dominant-negative TGF&#x003b2; receptor has been shown to decrease Smad2 phosphorylation and to disrupt fiber differentiation in transgenic mice (OVE591) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>]. However, recent studies of mice with conditional inactivation of T&#x003b2;RII in the lens showed no phenotype and it was suggested that overexpression of dominant-negative T&#x003b2;RII receptors resulted in nonspecific effects on lens differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>]. Interestingly, the lens fibers of the conditional null mice showed no reduction in phospho-Smad2 reactivity, suggesting that loss of T&#x003b2;RII receptors is insufficient to inhibit Smad2 activation and that there may be some redundancy of function with other receptors. The lens expresses BMP, TGF&#x003b2;, and activin receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r58">58</xref>].

Analysis of FAK expression in these lenses shows that while FAK is normally expressed and activated at embryonic stages, it becomes disrupted from about postnatal day 2 (P2). FAK protein appears to be incorrectly targeted as it remains in perinuclear compartments of fiber cells and is not found at the membranes in mutant lenses. Consistent with this, there is decreased cytoskeletal association of FAK and dramatic loss of FAK phosphorylation in these lenses at P2, suggesting that disruption of FAK targeting and activation contributes to this phenotype. Interestingly, the 70 kDa FAK COOH-terminal reactive fragment is lost from detergent-insoluble fractions and appears in the detergent-soluble fractions, suggesting that this fragment also no longer associates with the cytoskeleton. While the identity and function of this fragment is still not clear, it is unlikely to represent FRNK as this migrates at about 45 kDa.</p><p>TGF&#x003b2; is known to stimulate FAK activation in other systems, such as myofibroblast differentiation from fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r62">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r63">63</xref>] and in cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r64">64</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r66">66</xref>], thus this change in FAK activation may occur as a direct consequence of loss of TGF&#x003b2; family signaling in the lenses of these transgenic mice. However, the actin cytoskeleton is also essential for phoshorylation of FAK, as disruption of the actin cytoskeleton with cytochalasin-D abolishes FAK phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r67">67</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r68">68</xref>], thus the loss of FAK phosphorylation in these mutant lenses may be due to a primary disruption of the actin cytoskeleton. Interestingly, disruption of the actin cytoskeleton in cultured lenses with cytochalasin D results in a cortical cataract and cellular disruption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r69">69</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r70">70</xref>] that bears some similarities to the cataract seen in OVE591 mice. The fact that loss of FAK phosphorylation is detectable on postnatal day 2, which is prior to the onset of the phenotype, suggests that this is an early event in the disrupted fiber differentiation process in these transgenic lenses and that the absence of TGF&#x003b2;-like signals results in abnormal phosphorylation of FAK and this leads to abnormal actin cytoskeleton dynamics.</p><p>In summary, these studies show that FAK is expressed and activated during lens morphogenesis and differentiation. Its expression and activation during initiation of fiber differentiation at the lens equator appear to be modulated by FGF. Terminal differentiation of fibers also involves nuclear targeting of a phosphorylated NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal FAK fragment, which may play a role during fiber cell differentiation and denucleation. Moreover, during abnormal terminal fiber differentiation, in lenses expressing a dominant-negative TGF&#x003b2; receptor, there is abnormal subcellular targeting, loss of cytoskeletal association, and decreased activation of FAK. These data suggest that integrin signaling via FAK plays important roles during initiation of lens differentiation by FGF and completion of terminal differentiation mediated by TGF&#x003b2; family members.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by grants from the NHMRC (Australia) and Sydney Foundation for Medical Research to R.D.I.
