However, the life-in-service of joint implants is limited predominantly by aseptic loosening and periprosthetic osteolysis both causally linked to wear debris that are generated continuously by THA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Phagocytosed wear particles provoke macrophages, fibroblasts and other cells to release proinflammatory cytokines and mediators that attract other precursor cells. As a result, chronic inflammatory milieu and a foreign body granuloma develop [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. This, together with direct inhibition of osteoblast function by wear particles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], distorts homeostasis in bone in favour of excessive bone resorption, i.e. osteolysis, which can lead to aseptic loosening or periprosthetic fracture.</p><p>The concept of cytokines as initiators and perpetuators of particle disease is supported by reports on proinflammatory cytokine (IL-1, IL-6, TNF-&#x003b1;) up-regulation in macrophages and fibroblasts in response to wear particles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. These pleiotropic cytokines substantially promote the recruitment and maturation of osteoclast precursors at the bone-prosthesis interface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Particle disease/osteolysis might be also facilitated by down-regulation of immunomodulatory cytokines with anti-osteoclastogenic properties (e.g. IL-4, IL-10, IFN-&#x003b3;) as has been already demonstrated in inflammatory joint conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>However, so called "particle disease" cannot sufficiently explain either the variable degrees of osteolysis found in patients with similar wear rates (and thus exposure to wear particles) or differences in THA survivorship even in the case of the same implant and similar wear rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. For this reason, the concept of individual susceptibility to osteolysis must play a role. Generally, the interaction between the prosthesis and host can be influenced by several less or well known mechanisms including the allergic hypersensitivity, non-allergic and toxic response to a material constituent of the implant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Hypothetically, variation in genes for cytokines can alter gene function and/or expression which may affect the individual's resistance/susceptibility to severe osteolysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In support of this concept, Wilkinson <italic>et al</italic>. reported increased rate of osteolysis in patients carrying the A allele of the <italic>TNF</italic>-238 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Other studies have addressed variation in single genes for other candidate molecules in relationship with aseptic loosening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Surprisingly, only one study reported the variation in the axis of RANKL/RANK/OPG (at position <italic>RANK</italic>+575*T) that is considered the single most influencing regulator of osteoclastogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Interesting results were published by Gordon <italic>et al</italic>. on the association of periprosthetic osteolysis and polymorphism in genes for Wnt canonical pathway (FRZB 200Trp, FRZB 200Arg: 324Arg haplotype), [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Recently, the same team identified the association between carriage of <italic>IL1RN </italic>+2018*C allele and a decreased risk of osteolysis after THA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Taken together, none of the reported findings has been replicated in independent samples thus still being considered as preliminary. Therefore, researchers in the field are strongly encouraged to perform well-organized replication studies to enable a meta-analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>This study was conducted to investigate the contribution of genetic variation in proinflammatory/immunomodulatory cytokine genes to the risk of development of severe periprosthetic osteolysis. In addition, this study addressed the question whether there is an association between particular cytokine gene variants and risk of THA failure.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>Between February 2004 and June 2007 blood samples were collected by venopuncture from 205 patients with mild and severe acetabular bone defects around THA. The subjects were divided into these two groups according to the size of their acetabular bone defects. This was determined by the classification of Saleh <italic>et al</italic>. from preoperative radiographs and confirmed intraoperatively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Intraoperatively bone defects were evaluated distinguishing at the acetabular site: no significant bone loss (type I), contained bone loss (type II), moderate uncontained bone loss (type III), severe uncontained bone loss (types IV) and pelvic discontinuity (type V). Briefly, if patients fulfilled the criteria for acetabular bone defects of type I and II they were considered as having mild osteolysis (N = 89) while others with more extensive bone defects (types III to V) were classified as severe osteolysis (N = 116).</p><p>The study included only Czech Caucasian patients who were operated on at a single institution and those with an identical cementless prosthesis (ABG, Howmedica, Inc., Staines, England). The ABG 1 prosthesis was designed in the 1980s as a press-fit hemispherical cup and anatomical stem both with hydroxyapatite coating. All polyethylene liners were ram-extruded from Hostalen GUR 4150 and air-sterilized with 25 kGy gamma irradiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Our local register was scrutinized for patients who were and were not revised for osteolysis while the latter were chosen from patients with the longest follow-up assuming those are of "resistant genotype" against premature failure and development of severe osteolysis (phenotypically mild osteolysis). All patients were contacted and invited for clinical and radiographic examination and blood sampling. In patients with bilateral THA who were not revised on either side by the day of blood sampling, the data for hips with longer follow-up were included while in the case of revision, the data for hips with shorter follow-up were recorded. The reasons for that were similar as above, i.e. hypothesized risk genotype for severe acetabular osteolysis development.

Interpretation of final radiographs consisted of evaluation of implant stability, occurrence and extent of osteolysis.

In the revised cases (N = 157), the radiographic findings were supplemented with intraoperative findings. In this line, radiographic stability was re-coded (=changed) to loosening in cases where an implant instability was revealed after a weak levering of special tools for the cup/stem removal. Wear measurement was made using a Universal-type measuring microscope in the revised cases. Briefly, the methodology relies on the determination of nine three-dimensional coordinates on the surface of the prosthetic ball fixed inside the retrieved polyethylene cups in both the post-use and manufactured positions. Based on it, the centre of the prosthetic ball at each position and total wear can be calculated using the special computational algorithm. Briefly, previously reported accuracy of the method used for polyethylene wear measurement ranged from 1 to 4 &#x003bc;m and 1 to 9 mm<sup>3 </sup>for linear and volumetric wear, respectively; reliability of the method was also previously assessed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><p>All blood specimens were collected under the same conditions.

Distribution of investigated SNP variants was compared by univariate analysis between the groups of patients with severe (N = 116) and mild (N = 89) osteolysis. Three SNPs emerging from this analysis were tested also for association with secondary outcome of the study, i.e. cumulative hazard of THA failure. The revision of THA was considered as the end point in this analysis although it is known that the decision-making on the timing of revision depends on several factors including those unrelated to the prosthesis failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].

In particular, the study suggests that SNPs in genes for proinflammatory cytokines TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-6 may play a role in the pathogenesis of osteolysis. In addition, a SNP in the gene for the Th1 cytokine IL-2 was found to be a factor associated with severity of acetabular osteolysis and risk for premature THA failure.</p><p>In this study, carriage of the <italic>TNF</italic>-238*A allele was associated with severe acetabular osteolysis and risk for premature failure in contrast to the <italic>TNF</italic>-238 "GG" genotype. Individuals carrying the <italic>TNF</italic>-238*A were six times more prone to develop severe osteolysis than patients with the GG genotype. Accordingly, the striking risk for severe acetabular osteolysis associated with <italic>TNF</italic>-238*A carriage could be detected here at statistically significant level though this variant is relatively rare (see power calculations in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). Our study, therefore, confirms that <italic>TNF</italic>-238 SNP plays a role in the development of osteolysis as suggested by Wilkinson <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Concerning another SNP in <italic>TNF </italic>gene promoter, our findings are concordant to those of Wilkinson <italic>et al</italic>. and Kolundzic <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], who found no relationship between the carriage of the <italic>TNF</italic>-308*A allele and risk for osteolysis development or premature prosthetic failure.</p><p>To properly evaluate the contribution of SNPs in the <italic>TNF </italic>gene to osteolysis development and prognosis of THA, it should be acknowledged that the minor <italic>TNF</italic>-238*A allele occurs rarely in the normal population, limiting its contribution to the overall "population" risk of severe acetabular osteolysis (PAR value, 5.2%). This SNP may, however, serve as a marker for other causative polymorphism(s) in the <italic>TNF </italic>locus or neighbouring polymorphic major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes. This interpretation would be also in accordance with equivocal data from <italic>in vitro</italic>/<italic>ex vivo </italic>analyses of the functional influence of <italic>TNF</italic>-238 and also <italic>TNF</italic>-308 polymorphisms on <italic>TNF </italic>gene transcription and subsequent cytokine expression, processes which seem to be highly cell or stimulus specific [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>].</p><p>A SNP in the <italic>IL6 </italic>gene promoter was another polymorphism implicated in the pathogenesis of OL in this study. IL-6 is a multifunctional cytokine also involved in the regulation of bone metabolism; therefore its participation in the processes occurring at the bone-prosthesis interface is plausible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Here, <italic>IL6</italic>-174*G allele carriage was associated with the increased risk of severe osteolysis according to both the univariate and multivariate analyses. However, this SNP in gene for IL-6 did not influence the risk for cumulative hazard of THA failure. Association of <italic>IL6</italic>-174*G with severe osteolysis could not currently be supported by straightforward "mechanistic" explanation because its functional role on IL-6 expression is controversial. The allele <italic>IL6</italic>-174*G was originally associated with higher induced expression of IL-6 <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], however this was not subsequently confirmed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Importantly, Terry <italic>et al</italic>. revealed that effect of <italic>IL6 </italic>genetic variation on IL-6 expression is tissue-specific and dependent on other environmental factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. This observation may explain the opposite roles of <italic>IL6</italic>-174 SNP observed in different clinical conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Our results, therefore, allow us to speculate that complex local response around THA provides adequate conditions/stimuli promoting "penetrance" of the <italic>IL6</italic>-174 variant in terms of its effect on IL-6 expression. Concerning previous findings on <italic>IL6 </italic>gene in THA outcome, Malik <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] like us, reported no association of <italic>IL6</italic>-174 SNP with the risk of premature failure of cemented THA. The association of the <italic>IL6 </italic>SNP (positions -597 and -572) with the earlier prosthetic failure has been reported by Kolundzic <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. However, their study had a small number of patients and included both hips in the same patient into the analysis.</p><p>Based on our data the <italic>IL2</italic>-330*G genetic variant may function protectively against severe osteolysis which could result in significantly lower cumulative hazard of THA failure. Interestingly, Campos <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>] found that polymorphism in the <italic>IL2</italic>-330*G was not associated with premature failure of dental implants. Due to biological and mechanical similarities between THA and dental implants, both studies suggest a protective role of <italic>IL2 </italic>SNP on the prosthetic-bone interface. IL-2 regulates both survival and death of regulatory T cells which might affect the osteoclast life cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. However, the functional relevance of the investigated <italic>IL2 </italic>SNP is not clear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>] and thus the role of IL-2, and therefore also Th1 lymphocytes in the pathogenesis of periprosthetic osteolysis has yet to be elucidated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Whatever the mechanism behind possible IL-2 participation in pathological processes around THA, if proven in other centres/populations, the protective effects of the <italic>IL2</italic>-330*G would have clear implications because the G allele is carried by more than 50% of Europeans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>].</p><p>While interpreting the results of the current study, one should consider the theory of multifactorial susceptibility to complex disease and current issues of genetic association studies (GAS). Any individual genome contains many functional variants and many of these can influence the development of osteolysis in conjunction with other biological, mechanical and material factors. Furthermore, one may also conceivably argue that other genetic "elements" than those identified in this study may be involved in the complex process of particular disease via phenomenon of linkage disequilibrium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. Future investigations should be directed at detailed analyses of specified candidate regions on chromosomes 4q, 6p and 7q in order to search for further genetic markers of osteolysis developing after THA. Finally, based on current experience showing that the great proportion of GAS has not been replicated in independent samples, further validation through replication studies is strictly recommended [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. In this regard, it should be emphasised that our study replicated the findings of Wilkinson <italic>et al</italic>. for <italic>TNF</italic>-238*A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><sec><title>Limitations and strengths of our study</title><p>We are aware that relative heterogeneity of the primary diagnoses leading to index THA may be linked to the THA outcome including osteolysis. Nevertheless, genetic variants of cytokine genes (namely <italic>TNF</italic>-238*A and <italic>IL6</italic>-174*G) appeared to be independent predictors of severe osteolysis after adjustment for primary diagnosis and other relevant factors in the regression analysis. Moreover, the vast majority of dysplastic hips (over 98%) were of Hartofilakidis type I which influence the THA survival only insignificantly, and the remaining ones were of type II [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. In addition, selection bias might have an influence on the reported findings because not all patients with the ABG 1 prosthesis could be included in the study (205 of 506). In non-revised cases the severity of bone defects was determined primarily from radiography which could have led to underestimation of the true bone defects. Despite the rigorously created design of this association study, false positive findings cannot be excluded. On the other hand, only patients with identical prosthesis were included which eliminated the influence of inter-prosthetic differences on osteolysis development and prosthetic failure. In addition, surgery was performed at the single institution by a limited number of experienced surgeons which should minimize the role for surgery-related differences on failure of the implant.</p><p>Also from the genetic epidemiology view, our study meets the recently adopted criteria for GAS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Apart from emphasis on its preliminary character, this study had adequate study power (more than 80% in 19 of 22 investigated SNPs; see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>) and adhered to quality control methods in genotyping/analytical methodologies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]; overall genotyping "failure" rate was very low (less than two percent). Importantly, the parameter of PAR was included to estimate the specific contribution of investigated genetic markers among other complex individual and environmental factors promoting development of severe acetabular osteolysis and premature THA failure.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This case-control study associated gene polymorphisms in two proinflammatory cytokines TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-6 with extent of acetabular osteolysis. In addition, the risk for THA failure was increased in carriers of <italic>TNF</italic>-238*A allele. In contrast, a polymorphism of the gene for regulatory Th1 cytokine IL-2 emerged as a possible factor protecting against premature failure of THA and was negatively associated with osteolysis severity in univariate analysis. Collectively, the data expand the current paradigm of osteolysis as a predominantly inflammatory process and may implicate T-cells and their modulatory cytokines in the particle disease. If this single-centre data are replicated in other centres/population, new avenues will be opened up for the use of genetic testing in pre-surgical stages and also for investigation of immune response modulation in THA.</p></sec><sec><title>List of abbreviations used in the study</title><p>GAS: Genetic Association Study; IFN: Interferon; IL: Interleukins; M-CSF: Macrophage colony stimulating factor; OR: Odds ratio; PAR: Population attributable risk; RANKL: Receptor activator of NF-&#x003ba;&#x003b2; ligand; SNPs: Single nucleotide polymorphisms; TGF-&#x003b2;: Transforming growth factor beta; THA: Total hip arthroplasty; TNF-&#x003b1;: Tumour necrosis factor alpha.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>All three authors equally contributed to this paper; the order of the authors is alphabetical.
