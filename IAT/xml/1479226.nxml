To address if cellular kinases regulate EGFR internalization, we used anisomycin, a potent activator of kinase cascades in mammalian cells, especially the stress-activated mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase subtypes. Here, we report that activation of p38 MAP kinase by anisomycin is sufficient to induce internalization of EGFR. Anisomycin and EGF employ different mechanisms to promote EGFR endocytosis as anisomycin-induced internalization does not require tyrosine kinase activity or ubiquitination of the receptor. In addition, anisomycin treatment did not result in delivery and degradation of EGFR at lysosomes. Incubation with a specific inhibitor of p38, or depletion of endogenous p38 by small interfering RNAs, abolished anisomycin-induced internalization of EGFR while having no effect on transferrin endocytosis, indicating that the effect of p38 activation on EGFR endocytosis is specific. Interestingly, inhibition of p38 activation also abolished endocytosis of EGFR induced by UV radiation. Our results reveal a novel role for p38 in the regulation of EGFR endocytosis and suggest that stimulation of EGFR internalization by p38 might represent a general mechanism to prevent generation of proliferative or anti-apoptotic signals under stress conditions.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>anisomycin</kwd><kwd>EGFR</kwd><kwd>endocytosis</kwd><kwd>p38</kwd><kwd>UV</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Growth factors and their transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) play important roles during embryonic development and in the regulation of several cellular processes including proliferation, survival, migration and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>). Binding of growth factors to their receptors activates a myriad of signaling pathways that permit cells to respond to changes in the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>). In many cases, the termination of these signaling events is mediated by receptor internalization and degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>). The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is considered the prototypical member of the RTK family, and its activation and trafficking have been exhaustively characterized. Ligand binding results in receptor dimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>), activation and autophosphorylation of tyrosine residues in the cytosolic tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>). Phosphotyrosines serve then as docking sites for the formation of protein networks that mediate signaling as well as receptor endocytosis and degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). For example, autophosphorylation of specific tyrosines (Y992, Y1045, Y1068 and Y1086) is known to recruit specific adaptors such as phospholipase C&#x003b3;, Casitas B-lineage lymphoma (Cbl) or growth factor receptor binding protein 2 (Grb2).</p><p>Monoubiquitination of EGFR at multiple sites also seems to play an important role in receptor down-regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>). At the plasma membrane, receptor activation promotes the recruitment of Cbl, an ubiquitin ligase that mediates the ubiquitination of EGFR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>). Cbl can also interact with the endocytic machinery, thus ensuring EGFR internalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). At the endosomes, ubiquitin acts as a targeting signal for degradation through interaction with the multivesicular body-sorting machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>).</p><p>However, there are still several aspects of EGFR trafficking that remain controversial. One is whether receptor ubiquitination is required for internalization or if it just plays a role in the delivery of the receptor to lysosomes. It has been shown that chimerae consisting of the extracellular and transmembrane domains of EGFR fused to a single cytosolic exposed ubiquitin are constitutively internalized and degraded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>). However, other investigators have reported that receptor ubiquitination is not sufficient for EGFR endocytosis and that the role of Cbl is to link EGFR to coated pits through the interaction of Cbl with CIN85/endophilin complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>). Recently, it has been suggested that ubiquitin could determine the route of EGFR internalization so that non-ubiquitinated EGFR exclusively follows a clathrin-dependent pathway, while ubiquitinated EGFR can enter into the cell through both clathrin-coated pits and caveolae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>).</p><p>Another open question to be resolved is the role of kinases in RTK internalization. As mentioned previously, EGF stimulation activates different protein kinases that participate in the transmission of many proliferative and differentiative signals. These protein kinases include the extracellular signal-regulated protein kinases (ERK) and two mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases, the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>) and the p38 MAP kinase (p38) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>). There is growing evidence showing that kinase activation does not only happen at the plasma membrane but also at endosomes. Several EGFR downstream signaling factors such as Grb2, Shc and mSOS localize to endosomes shortly after EGFR internalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). In addition, robust MAP kinase activation requires the presence of active EGFR at endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>) and seems to promote cell survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>). Therefore, trafficking of EGFR regulates signal propagation and amplification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>). Conversely, it has been suggested that signaling can regulate EGFR internalization, as different proteins implicated in signal transduction have been shown to interact with the endocytosis sorting machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>). Recently, Zerial's group carried out high-throughput RNA interference analysis to address the role of kinases in endocytosis and showed that a large number of kinases previously implicated in proliferation, growth and cell adhesion also have a role in endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>).</p><p>Anisomycin is an antibiotic isolated from <italic>Streptomyces griseolus</italic> that inhibits protein synthesis by blocking peptidyl transferase activity in eukaryote ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>). Anisomycin is a very useful tool because it selectively activates kinase cascades in mammalian cells, especially the MAP kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>). In this study, we used anisomycin to activate MAP kinases in the absence of ligand and analyzed the effect of this activation on EGFR internalization. Interestingly, we observed that anisomycin treatment induced EGFR endocytosis and that this process was independent of tyrosine phosphorylation or ubiquitination. Moreover, preincubation of the cells with SB203580, a highly specific inhibitor of p38 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>), or depletion of endogenous p38 by small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) treatment, abolished the anisomycin-induced EGFR internalization suggesting that this MAP kinase plays an important role in the regulation of EGFR trafficking.</p><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Anisomycin induces EGFR internalization</title><p>To address if the activation of MAP kinases induced by anisomycin has any effect on EGFR internalization, we made use of a chimera in which green fluorescent protein (GFP) has been attached to the carboxyl terminus of human EGFR (EGFR-GFP). This construct allowed us to easily visualize EGFR trafficking by immunofluorescence. It has been previously described that EGFR-GFP biochemical and cellular properties do not differ from EGFR-wt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> shows that at stationary state, most of EGFR-GFP localized at the plasma membrane confirming that the presence of the GFP did not alter the normal distribution of the protein. Addition of EGF caused a rapid internalization of the receptor to endosomal structures as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>). Interestingly, treatment with anisomycin for short periods of time also induced endocytosis of EGFR-GFP.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Anisomycin induces internalization of epidermal growth factor receptor-green fluorescent protein (EGFR-GFP)</title><p>(A) HeLa cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding EGFR-GFP.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, we found extensive co-localization of EGFR-GFP with early endosomal markers, such as EEA1 or internalized transferrin, after incubation with the drug for 15 min. In contrast, no co-localization with the late endosomal/lysosomal marker CD63 was observed. Incubation with EGF for 15 min also caused redistribution of EGFR-GFP from the plasma membrane to early endosomes (see <italic>Supplementary Material</italic>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>) indicating that both compounds promote trafficking of EGFR-GFP to the same compartments.</p><p>Next, we analyzed if anisomycin had the same effect on endogenous EGFR.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, treatment with either anisomycin or EGF caused a reduction of approximately 70% in the amount of endogenous EGFR present at the plasma membrane. This indicated that the effect observed by using EGFR-GFP was not a consequence of protein over-expression or mistargeting of the receptor due to the presence of GFP at the cytosolic tail, and validates the use of this chimera.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Anisomycin promotes endocytosis of endogenous epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)</title><p>(A) Control HeLa cells (blue line) or cells treated with EGF (green) or anisomycin (pink) for 15 min were fixed, and the amount of EGFR present at the plasma membrane was measured by flow cytometry.

However, the receptor appeared at punctate structures following approximately 7 or 8 min of incubation. Many of these punctate structures contained clathrin and the clathrin adaptor AP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) suggesting that anisomycin induces EGFR internalization through a clathrin-dependent pathway. To test this possibility, we examined the effect of over-expressing a dominant-negative mutant of dynamin2 (Dyn2-K44A-GFP), a GTPase that is required for the clathrin-dependent internalization of endocytic receptors. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, over-expression of Dyn2-K44A-GFP clearly blocked anisomicyn-induced internalization of EGFR. To further corroborate these data, we reduced the expression of endogenous AP2&#x003bc; subunit (&#x003bc;2) by using specific siRNA oligonucleotides. Immunoblot analysis revealed a 92% reduction in the levels of &#x003bc;2 when compared with cells transfected with control (non-silencing) siRNA. Levels of &#x003bc;1 and &#x003bc;3 were monitored as control for the specificity of the antisense (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). HeLa cells depleted of &#x000b5;2 showed very little internalization of transferrin-rhodamine when compared with control cells, indicating that AP2-dependent endocytosis is impaired under our experimental conditions (data not shown). As expected, depletion of &#x000b5;2 abolished anisomycin-induced internalization of endogenous EGFR indicating that the endocytosis is AP2 dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,F</xref>). Finally, we analyzed the effect of clathrin siRNA. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E,F</xref> shows that reduction in the levels of clathrin caused a clear decrease in the amount of EGFR that was internalized in response to anisomycin. In contrast, depletion of GGA3, a clathrin adaptor that regulates sorting of proteins at <italic>trans</italic> Golgi network and endosomes, or treatment with non-silencing siRNA, did not affect EGFR internalization. All together, these data indicate that anisomycin induces endocytosis of EGFR through clathrin-coated pits.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Anisomycin promotes endocytosis of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) through clathrin-coated pits</title><p>(A) HeLa cells expressing EGFR-green fluorescent protein (GFP) were treated with anisomycin (60 &#x000b5;<sc>m</sc>) for 8 min, fixed, stained with the indicated antibodies and analyzed by confocal microscopy.

It has been proposed that the recruitment of the endocytic machinery, through interactions with both phosphotyrosines and ubiquitin, plays a role in the regulation of the receptor endocytosis. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, we used antibodies against specific phosphotyrosines to follow the activation of the EGFR-GFP after EGF or anisomycin treatment. As mentioned previously, the addition of EGF for 15 min induced a clear redistribution of EGFR-GFP to intracellular vesicles. The majority of these structures was also labeled with antibodies against phophotyrosines 845, 1068 and 1086 indicating that EGFR-GFP is activated. In contrast, incubation with anisomycin caused receptor internalization, but no activation as no staining for phosphorylated tyrosines 845, 1068 or 1086 was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). We also generated several mutants in which different residues that are phosphorylated after receptor activation were mutated to alanines, including Y845, Y974, Y1045, Y1068, Y1086 and the double mutant S1046/S1047. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3">Figure S3</xref>, <italic>Supplementary Material</italic>, shows that none of these mutations affected the normal distribution of the EGFR-GFP or its response to anisomycin. In addition, EGFR-GFP immunoprecipitates from HeLa cells treated with EGF or anisomycin were immunoblotted with the anti-phosphotyrosine antibody 4G10 confirming that EGF, but not anisomycin, induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Anisomycin also failed to stimulate ubiquitination of EGFR-GFP as observed by immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblotting with FK2 antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).

HeLa cells were treated with cycloheximide alone, anisomycin or EGF plus cycloheximide for different periods of time. Western blotting showed that there was a marked down-regulation of EGFR after 2 h of incubation with EGF. In contrast, anisomycin caused a much slower degradation of EGFR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Quantification of several independent experiments revealed that the differences in the kinetics of EGFR degradation were more evident after short incubation times. For example, EGFR levels dropped a 50% after 1 h of incubation with EGF but showed little change with anisomycin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Interestingly, treatment with proteosomal inhibitors such as MG132 almost completely abolished anisomycin-induced EGFR degradation but had little effect on EGF-mediated degradation. Conversely, lysosomal inhibitors blocked EGF but not anisomycin-mediated degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). These results suggest that anisomycin does not induce delivery of EGFR to lysosomes. Instead, the receptor could cycle between plasma membrane and endosomes until it is degraded most probably through the proteosome, although alternative mechanisms like caspase activation cannot be ruled out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>). Consistent with this idea, we observed a good co-localization between EGFR-GFP and transferrin up to 1 h following EGFR-GFP internalization (data not shown).</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Anisomycin induces down-regulation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)</title><p>(A) HeLa cells were starved for 8 h in DMEM containing 0.1% BSA and incubated with cycloheximide alone, EGF plus cycloheximide or anisomycin for the indicated times.

In order to test this possibility, we used a specific inhibitor for p38.

To do so, HeLa cells were transfected either with a pool of siRNAs targeting p38&#x003b1; (siRNA-p38&#x003b1;), p38&#x003b2; (siRNA-p38&#x003b2;) or a combination of both (siRNA-p38&#x003b1; + &#x003b2;). As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, expression of p38&#x003b1;, but not that of p38&#x003b2;, was abrogated in siRNA-p38&#x003b1; cells, while an inhibition in the expression of p38&#x003b2;, but not p38&#x003b1;, was seen in siRNA-p38&#x003b2; cells. Transfection of siRNA-p38&#x003b1; +&#x003b2; caused a significant reduction in the levels of both p38&#x003b1; and p38&#x003b2;, while treatment with a control non-targeting siRNA did not affect the expression of either of the two isoforms. Interestingly, abrogation of expression of either p38&#x003b1; or p38&#x003b2; reduced the efficiency of EGFR internalization after anisomycin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). This reduction was much more robust in siRNA-p38&#x003b1; + &#x003b2; cells, where only a 10% EGFR internalization was observed after incubation with anisomycin for 15 min. All together, these results indicate that both p38&#x003b1; and p38&#x003b2; might act synergistically in the regulation of EGFR trafficking.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><title>Effect of silencing of p38&#x003b1; and p38&#x003b2; on anisomycin-induced epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) internalization</title><p>(A) HeLa cells were treated with small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeted to p38&#x003b1; (siRNA-p38&#x003b1;), p38&#x003b2; (siRNA-p38&#x003b2;) or both (siRNA-p38&#x003b1; + &#x003b2;).

Interestingly, EGFR endocytosis was independent of RTK activity and monoubiquitination of the cytosolic tail indicating that EGF and anisomycin employ different mechanisms to promote internalization. The lack of ubiquitination prevented the delivery of EGFR to lysosomes for degradation. This observation is in agreement with recent reports that found that ubiquitination of EGFR is required for interaction with the mutivesicular bodies-sorting machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>).</p><p>p38 was originally identified as a kinase phosphorylated in response to endocytic lipopolysacharides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>). Later, it was found that p38 activity is also up-regulated when cells are exposed to a variety of stimuli including certain growth factors, proinflammatory cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>) and different forms of environmental stress such as UV light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>), heat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>) and osmotic shock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>). To date, four members of the p38 group of MAP kinases have been characterized, including p38&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>), p38&#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>), p38&#x003b3; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>) and p38&#x003b4; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>). SB203580 is a selective inhibitor for both, p38&#x003b1; and &#x003b2;, but has no effect on the activity of the &#x003b3; and &#x003b4; isoforms. The inhibition of the anisomycin-induced EGFR internalization observed in the presence of SB203580 strongly suggests the involvement of p38&#x003b1; and/or p38&#x003b2; in this process. The additive effect of p38&#x003b1; and p38&#x003b2; silencing on EGFR internalization after anisomycin treatment corroborate that both isoforms likely play an important role in the regulation of EGFR trafficking. It is important to note that, while inhibition of p38 activation clearly prevented EGFR entry into the cells, no effect on transferrin internalization was observed, indicating that SB203580 does not cause a general block of clathrin-mediated endocytosis.</p><p>Recently, it has been shown that exposure of cells to UV radiation also induces internalization of EGFR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>), but the precise mechanism that controls this process remains unknown. Significantly, there are several similarities between UV-induced and anisomycin-induced EGFR endocytosis. For example, in both cases, EGFR internalization is processed by clathrin-coated pits, is independent of RTK activity or autophosphorylation, does not require receptor ubiquitination and does not result in lysosomal degradation of the receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>). In this paper, we show that activation of p38 is involved in the UV-induced internalization of EGFR, suggesting that the regulation of EGFR endocytosis by p38 can occur under physiological conditions. It has been shown that EGFR is involved in cell proliferation, survival and tumorogenesis and that preventing EGFR down-regulation facilitates cell transformation. Therefore, external stimuli that cause p38 activation could control the accessibility of EGFR at the plasma membrane preventing that way cell proliferation and survival under stress conditions.</p><p>How does p38 promote the internalization of EGFR? There is growing evidence showing that p38 plays an important role in numerous biological processes including inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>), development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref>), cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">60</xref>), cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">61</xref>), cardiomyocyte hypertrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62">62</xref>), cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b64">64</xref>), senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b65">65</xref>) and tumorogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66">66</xref>). Recently, it has been suggested that p38 might also participate in the regulation of endocytic trafficking. Cavalli <italic>et al</italic>. (2001) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b67">67</xref>) have reported that p38 can phosphorylate and activate guanyl-nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (GDI), a key regulator of the Rab cycle. Rab proteins are small monomeric GTPases with molecular masses in the 20&#x02013;30 kDa range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b68">68</xref>). Multiple Rabs have been shown to participate in the formation, fusion and movement of vesicular traffic intermediaries between different membrane compartments of the cell. Rabs function as molecular switches by cycling between two interconvertible forms, a cytosolic GDP-bound (inactive) form and a membrane associated GTP-bound (active) form. In addition, Rabs also cycle between membrane-bound and cytosolic states, and this cycling is regulated by GDI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b69">69</xref>).</p><p>Rab 5 in particular seems to play an important role in the trafficking of EGFR. Several studies have established that activated EGFR modulates the GTPase activity of Rab5 by targeting either GTPase-activating proteins, such as RN-Tre (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b70">70</xref>), or GTP exchange factors, such as RIN1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b71">71</xref>). The activation of Rab5 through EGFR or the expression of constitutively active mutants of Rab5 stimulates both the internalization and degradation of activated EGFR. In contrast, dominant negative Rab5 blocks EGF-stimulated receptor-mediated and fluid-phase endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b72">72</xref>). Therefore, p38 could promote EGFR endocytosis by stimulating the activity of GDI in extracting Rab5 from the endosomal membranes and forming cytosolic GDI-Rab5 complex. Interestingly, GDI-Rab5 has been identified as a component of the machinery controlling clathrin-coated endocytic vesicle formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b73">73</xref>). In addition, GDI might facilitate the delivery of Rab5 to specific regions of the plasma membrane facilitating the interaction with cytoskeleton or specific effectors. In agreement with this idea, Huang <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b74">74</xref>) have shown that the activation of p38 induced by metabotropic glutamate receptor agonists accelerates loss of surface amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors by stimulating the formation of GDI-Rab5 complexes.</p><p>We cannot discard the possibility that activation of p38 could also affect EGFR recycling. Recent evidence suggests that p38 can be recruited to endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>) and regulates endosomal Rab5 effectors such as EEA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b75">75</xref>). p38 also seems to play a negative regulatory role in <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> infection by modulating the recruitment of EEA1 to phagosomes and inhibiting that way phagosome maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b76">76</xref>). This involvement may reflect a more general role for p38 in the regulation of intracellular trafficking. While further studies will be required to assess the specific mechanisms used by p38 to regulate EGFR internalization, our results strengthen the idea that there is a clear intercommunication between signaling and intracellular trafficking and suggest that p38 is a key player in this process.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Antibodies and reagents</title><p>The following commercial antibodies were used: mouse monoclonal anti-ubiquitin (FK2; Affiniti, Devon, UK), mouse monoclonal anti-EEA1, mouse monoclonal anti-CHC and mouse monoclonal anti-GGA3 (BD Transduction Laboratories, San Jose, CA, USA), mouse monoclonal anti-human TGF&#x003b2;RII (R&#x00026;D Systems Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA), mouse monoclonal to &#x003b1;-adaptin (AP-6; Affinity Bioreagents, Golden, CO, USA), mouse monoclonal anti-CD63 (H5C6; BD Pharmigen, San Jose, CA, USA), mouse phosphotyrosine antibody (clone 4G10; Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY, USA), rabbit anti-GFP (MBL International, Woburn, MA, USA), mouse monoclonal and rat monoclonal anti-EGF receptor (ab3103 and ICR10; Abcam, Cambridge, MA, USA).
