We show that the p47 GTPases, including IIGP1, accumulate at vacuoles containing <italic>T. gondii.</italic> The accumulation is GTP-dependent and requires live parasites. Vacuolar IIGP1 accumulations undergo a maturation-like process accompanied by vesiculation of the parasitophorous vacuole membrane. This culminates in disruption of the parasitophorous vacuole and finally of the parasite itself. Over-expression of IIGP1 leads to accelerated vacuolar disruption whereas a dominant negative form of IIGP1 interferes with interferon-&#x003b3;-mediated killing of intracellular parasites. Targeted deletion of the IIGP1 gene results in partial loss of the IFN-&#x003b3;-mediated <italic>T. gondii</italic> growth restriction in mouse astrocytes.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="synopsis"><title>Synopsis</title><p><italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> is a small unicellular parasite infecting virtually every warm-blooded animal including humans. After infection, <italic>T. gondii</italic> does not stay in extracellular fluids such as the blood, but actively invades body cells. The parasite has developed elaborate mechanisms enabling it to form a so-called parasitophorous vacuole (PV) within the cell it invades. Within this vacuole the parasite multiplies until the host cell ruptures and the progeny are released into the extracellular space to infect further cells. Host cells have developed several special mechanisms to combat the parasite. In mice, these mechanisms include a protein family, the p47 GTPases, which are induced by immune-alert factors called interferons. This study begins to address how the mouse p47 GTPases function. The study shows that the p47 GTPases assemble on the PV very shortly after infection, apparently to form a &#x0201c;membrane attack complex.&#x0201d; Within an hour the PV membrane shows signs of damage, bulging into small out-foldings that separate from the membrane in small vesicles. Shortly afterward the PV membrane ruptures and the parasite deteriorates. The p47 GTPase have several properties in common with the dynamin GTPases, which deform cellular membranes, suggesting that the p47 GTPases function in a mechanistically similar manner.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="15"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>Citation:</meta-name><meta-value>Martens S, Parvanova I, Zerrahn J, Griffiths G, Schell G, et al.

We tentatively conclude, with Butcher et al. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010024-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d;, that LRG-47 does not localize significantly to the <italic>T. gondii</italic> vacuole. In uninfected, IFN-&#x003b3;-stimulated cells the p47 GTPases are associated with ER (IIGP1, IGTP, and TGTP) and Golgi (LRG-47, GTPI) membranes or are cytosolic (IRG-47) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010024-b035">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010024-b037">37</xref>&#x0005d; (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0010024-sg002">Figure S2</xref>, unpublished data). Accumulation of p47 GTPases at the <italic>T. gondii</italic> vacuole could not be explained by the recruitment of ER cisternae to the vacuole &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010024-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;. The ER-localized chaperones, ERP60, protein disulphide isomerase (PDI), and calnexin, were hardly detectable at the PVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0010024-g003">Figure 3</xref>), while IIGP1 localization was extremely intense (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0010024-g003">Figure 3</xref>); indeed a useful image of IIGP1 localization at the vacuole could be obtained only under photographic conditions under which the ER localization of this abundant protein was invisible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0010024-g003">Figure 3</xref>A&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0010024-g003">3</xref>C). As noted above, IIGP1 was also markedly more concentrated at the PV than the other completely ER-localized p47 GTPase, IGTP &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010024-b036">36</xref>&#x0005d; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0010024-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). By immunogold electron microscopy for IIGP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0010024-g004">Figures 4</xref>A and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0010024-sg003">S3</xref>) we saw intense label clearly localized to the PVM around many vacuoles in IFN-&#x003b3;-induced cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0010024-g004">Figure 4</xref>A), while only weak label was detectable on ER cisternae. These results show that IIGP1, ER-localised in the interferon-induced cell, is repositioned and intensely concentrated at the PVM shortly after <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection. By implication, the same is true for TGTP. IRG-47 is almost exclusively cytoplasmic in the interferon-induced cell &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010024-b035">35</xref>&#x0005d;, while GTPI is almost exclusively localized to the Golgi (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0010024-sg002">Figure S2</xref>). The repositioning of these two p47 GTPases to the PV therefore also cannot be secondary to the accumulation of ER cisternae at the PV. We conclude that the p47 GTPases, with the possible exception of LRG-47, accumulate at the PV shortly after <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection of interferon-stimulated cells; this accumulation is independent of the accumulation of ER cisternae.</p><p>We next analyzed the behavior of IIGP1 in more detail. The recruitment of IIGP1 to the PV is stimulated by active invasion of host cells by the parasites. Heat-killed <italic>T. gondii</italic> were efficiently internalized by phagocytosis, but no IIGP1 was detected on vacuoles surrounding the dead parasites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0010024-g002">Figure 2</xref>G). Rather, this compartment was LAMP-1 positive and presumably corresponds to phagolysosomes. LAMP-1 was absent from IIGP1-positive vacuoles containing live <italic>T. gondii</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0010024-g002">Figure 2</xref>H) at any time point after infection. Surprisingly, IIGP1 does not apparently accumulate on every PV. Approximately 30&#x00025; of the PVs had already accumulated IIGP1 by 15 min after infection. By 1 to 2 h post-infection, approximately 75&#x00025; of vacuoles were IIGP1-positive (about 50&#x00025; strongly positive), falling to about 20&#x00025; after 8 h. At 24 h after infection, PVs containing apparently dividing parasites were IIGP1 negative and in many of the infected cells at this time the total cellular IIGP1 signal was markedly lower than in uninfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0010024-g002">Figure 2</xref>F).</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Maturation of the Vacuolar IIGP1 Accumulations</title><p>The IIGP1 accumulations seen at the PV by immunofluorescence showed different vacuolar morphologies that we termed smooth, rough, and disrupted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0010024-g004">Figure 4</xref>B).

At disrupted vacuoles, IIGP1 localized to very bright aggregate-like structures that did not completely surround the parasite. Long IIGP1-positive filaments frequently emanated from rough and disrupted vacuoles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0010024-g004">Figure 4</xref>C).

At later time points (6 to 8 h post-infection), disrupted PVs are probably underestimated because they disintegrate and become uncountable. Initially smooth IIGP1-positive PVs therefore probably mature via a rough to a disrupted IIGP1 morphology.

As the GRA7 signal weakened at the vacuole, so the GRA7 became increasingly distributed throughout the cytoplasm of infected cells. In particular, at later time points we observed IFN-&#x003b3;-stimulated cells displaying a strong cytoplasmic GRA7 signal but no apparent vacuole, suggesting that disseminated GRA7 is a relic of vacuolar destruction. Sometimes as early as 2 h after infection, a strong GRA7 signal was seen throughout the cytoplasm of interferon-stimulated, infected cells containing no visible vacuole defined by GRA7.

However the initially homogenous GFP-LC3 signal condensed into vesicular structures in close proximity to rough IIGP1- and TGTP-positive vacuoles.

At the electron microscopical level no investing membrane structures surrounding disrupted vacuoles were seen that could be interpreted as autophagic membranes.

In the case of IIGP1, however, the accumulation of the GTPase is far more intense than that of any of three other ER proteins examined as markers for ER accumulation at the vacuole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0010024-g003">Figure 3</xref>). The case that IGTP is repositioned from the ER to the PV is less clear than that for IIGP1 since the intensity of this p47 at the PV is less striking than that of the other GTPases, though still relatively more intense than the ER markers. Evidently accumulation of ER cisternae at the PV also fails to account for the PV accumulation of the Golgi-localized GTPI (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0010024-sg002">Figure S2</xref>) or of the cytosolic IRG-47 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010024-b035">35</xref>&#x0005d;. Although the trigger for the striking relocation of the p47 GTPases is currently unknown, it requires GTP binding at least for TGTP1 and IIGP1 since IIGP1K82A and TGTPK69A fail to relocate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0010024-g007">Figure 7</xref>B, unpublished data).

This stochastic behavior is unlikely to have a purely kinetic basis since no difference was observed when <italic>T. gondii</italic> infections were synchronized by centrifugation of the parasites onto the cell layers (unpublished data). We have been able to show in reconstruction experiments in fibroblasts that the p47 GTPases are the only interferon-inducible components necessary for the initiation of p47 accumulation at the PV (unpublished data).

Such a situation could explain the apparent anomaly that the two p47 GTPases, whose elimination leads to the strongest phenotypes in <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection, are IGTP and LRG-47, one of which, IGTP, is only weakly associated with the PV, possibly via ER accumulation, and the other (LRG-47) is probably not associated with the PV at all.</p><p>IIGP1 directly associates with the PVM and localizes to apparently PVM-derived vesicles with an electron-dense coat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0010024-g004">Figures 4</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0010024-g006">6</xref>). In view of the intense concentration of p47 GTPases on the PVM it is plausible that the electron-dense coat indeed consists of p47 GTPases.

It is therefore conceivable, though not yet formally shown, that IIGP1 and also probably other p47 GTPases act directly on the PVM causing its deformation and vesiculation and thereby disruption.

While it is not clear why the cytosol may be an inimical environment for <italic>T. gondii,</italic> there are precedents showing that bacteria that normally replicate in modified phagosomes are inviable when introduced into the cytosol &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010024-b052">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010024-b053">53</xref>&#x0005d;. Interestingly, the anti-microbial activity of the host cell cytosol was cell-type dependent and, in RAW 264.7 macrophages, induced by the pre-exposure of the host cell to the pathogen &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010024-b053">53</xref>&#x0005d;. There is no independent experience of the viability of <italic>T. gondii</italic> released into the cytosol. However, the intensive modification of the PV by the parasite surely indicates a high level of co-adaptation between the organism and its constructed microenvironment.</p><p>The disruption of <italic>T. gondii</italic> PVs accompanied by cytoplasmic dissemination of parasite-encoded proteins such as GRA7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0010024-g005">Figure 5</xref>) may also accelerate presentation of antigens to the adaptive immune system via the class I pathway. Release of GRA7 into the cytosol and association with host cytoplasmic structures has been reported before in the absence of interferon treatment. In this case, however, GRA7 release occurred much later, possibly coincident with the tachyzoite-bradyzoite transition. The possible implication of this late GRA7 release for class I antigen presentation was also noted &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010024-b042">42</xref>&#x0005d;. A recent study showed the MHC class I restricted, TAP-dependent presentation of a <italic>T. gondii</italic>-encoded protein that was secreted into the vacuolar space by splenocytes of infected mice &#x0005b;60&#x0005d;. It is conceivable that the p47 GTPase-dependent disruption of the PVs contributes to the accessibility of this protein to the antigen presentation machinery.</p><p>We have identified a previously unknown mechanism of cell-autonomous resistance in mice against the intracellular protozoan pathogen <italic>T. gondii.</italic> This involves a direct attack on the PVM leading to vesiculation and ultimately disruption of the membrane, and requires the participation of multiple interferon-inducible p47 GTPases. In view of the wide sequence divergence and distinctive resistance properties associated with the different p47 GTPases &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010024-b028">28</xref>&#x0005d; it will be of interest to find out whether a role in membrane vesiculation is their exclusive mode of action on pathogen-containing vacuolar compartments, including phagosomal derivatives, or whether their contribution to pathogen resistance is more diverse than this. Thus MacMicking et al. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010024-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d; have concluded from their own studies on resistance in mice to <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> that LRG-47 acts in the interferon-stimulated cell to accelerate phagosomal acidification, an activity which is difficult to reconcile with the phenomena observed here, where the <italic>T. gondii</italic> PVs never enter the lysosomal system as defined by the acquisition of LAMP1.</p><p>As we have shown &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010024-b028">28</xref>&#x0005d;, there are 23 p47 GTPase genes in mice, of which at least 14 are inducible by interferon. Only four of these (IGTP, LRG-47, IRG-47, and IIGP1) have yet been analyzed experimentally to any significant extent and all these have been shown to be active, each in its distinctive way, in resistance to vacuolar pathogens. They have so far been implicated in resistance to a remarkable range of major pathogens (Gram negative bacteria: <italic>Salmonella typhimurium;</italic> Gram positive bacteria: <italic>Listeria monocytogenes;</italic> Mycobacteria: <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> and <italic>Mycobacterium avium;</italic> Protozoa: <italic>T. gondii, Leishmania donovani, Trypanosoma cruzi</italic>) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010024-b024">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010024-b027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010024-b054">54</xref>&#x0005d;. There is no reason to doubt that the complexity and functional diversity of the p47 resistance system will be further extended as new family members are analyzed in detail. It is evident that the entire structure of immunity in mice against vacuolar pathogens is critically dependent on the effector mechanisms delivered by the p47 GTPases. Against this background, therefore, it is quite an extraordinary fact that the p47 resistance system is completely absent in man &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0010024-b028">28</xref>&#x0005d;. The implications of this remarkable difference in the deployment of immune mechanisms between man and his principal experimental model organism, the mouse, will require extensive experimental analysis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>In vitro passage of <italic>T. gondii.</italic></title><p>Tachyzoites from <italic>T. gondii</italic> strain ME49 were maintained by serial passage in confluent monolayers of human foreskin fibroblasts (HS27, ATCC).
