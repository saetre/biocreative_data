We sought to elucidate genetic mechanisms whereby a polymorphism evolved in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> under glucose limitation and persisted because of cross-feeding among multiple adaptive clones. Apart from a 29 kb deletion in the dominant clone, no large-scale genomic changes distinguished evolved clones from their common ancestor. Using transcriptional profiling on co-evolved clones cultured separately under glucose-limitation we identified 180 genes significantly altered in expression relative to the common ancestor grown under similar conditions. Ninety of these were similarly expressed in all clones, and many of the genes affected (e.g., <italic>mglBAC</italic>, <italic>mglD</italic>, and <italic>lamB</italic>) are in operons coordinately regulated by CRP and/or rpoS. While the remaining significant expression differences were clone-specific, 93&#x00025; were exhibited by the majority clone, many of which are controlled by global regulators, CRP and CpxR. When transcriptional profiling was performed on adaptive clones cultured together, many expression differences that distinguished the majority clone cultured in isolation were absent, suggesting that CpxR may be activated by overflow metabolites removed by cross-feeding strains in co-culture. Relative to their common ancestor, shared expression differences among adaptive clones were partly attributable to early-arising shared mutations in the <italic>trans</italic>-acting global regulator, rpoS, and the <italic>cis</italic>-acting regulator, <italic>mglO</italic>. Gene expression differences that distinguished clones may in part be explained by mutations in <italic>trans</italic>-acting regulators <italic>malT</italic> and <italic>glpK</italic>, and in <italic>cis</italic>-acting sequences of <italic>acs</italic>. In the founder, a <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory mutation in <italic>acs</italic> (acetyl CoA synthetase) and a structural mutation in <italic>glpR</italic> (glycerol-3-phosphate repressor) likely favored evolution of specialists that thrive on overflow metabolites. Later-arising mutations that led to specialization emphasize the importance of compensatory rather than gain-of-function mutations in this system. Taken together, these findings underscore the importance of regulatory change, founder genotype, and the biotic environment in the adaptive evolution of microbes.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Authors Summary</title><p>Experimental evolution of asexual species has shown that multiple genotypes can arise from a single ancestor and stably coexist (<italic>e unibus plurum</italic>). Although facilitated by environmental heterogeneity, this phenomenon also occurs in simple, homogeneous environments provisioned with a single limiting nutrient. We sought to discover genetic mechanisms that enabled an <italic>E. coli</italic> population founded by a single clone to become an interacting community composed of multiple clones. The founder of this population contained mutations that impair regulation of acetate and glycerol metabolism and likely favored the evolution of cross-feeding. Adaptive clones share <italic>cis</italic>- and <italic>trans</italic>-regulatory mutations shown elsewhere to enhance fitness under glucose limitation. Certain mutations that distinguish adaptive clones and underlie evolution of specialists were compensatory rather than gain-of-function, and all that we detected resulted in gene expression changes rather than protein structure changes. Evolved clones exhibited both common and clone-specific gene expression changes relative to their common ancestor; the pattern of gene expression in the dominant clone cultured alone differed from the pattern observed when it was cultured with variants feeding on its overflow metabolites. These findings illuminate the roles played by founder genotype, differential gene regulation, and the biotic environment in the adaptive evolution of bacteria.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="19"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s2"><title>Introduction</title><p>Evolutionary biologists have long sought to understand mechanistically how adaptive genetic variation arises and persists.

But, long generation times, sexual recombination and practical limits on lab population size make higher eukaryotes imperfectly suited to study the tempo, trajectory and mechanisms by which evolution occurs in asexual species and in the somatic cells of sexual organisms. There, new genetic variation is limited by the rate of mutation supply and, in bacteria, also by the incidence of horizontal gene transfer. Fortunately, evolution in asexual species and cells can be studied using microbial models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000713-Zeyl1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000713-Elena1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. Early microbial studies helped lead to two generalizations concerning the emergence and persistence of genetic variation in large, asexual populations. First, over <italic>ecological time</italic> and in the absence of spatial structure and differential predation, competition for the same limiting resource selects for one fittest variant, an insight that came to be known as the &#x0201c;competitive exclusion principle&#x0201d; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000713-Hardin1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000713-Gause1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. Second, over <italic>evolutionary time</italic> variation arising by mutation is subject to &#x0201c;periodic selection&#x0201d; leading to a succession of genotypes each more fit than its immediate predecessor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000713-Muller1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000713-Novick1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. These generalizations led to the expectation that large, clonal populations evolving under resource limitation should exhibit limited genetic variation.</p><p>Experimental evidence now suggests otherwise. Multiple genotypes which arise from a single ancestral clone can coexist over evolutionary time; in other words, out of one comes many (<italic>e unum pluribus</italic>). This phenomenon has been documented in spatially and temporally unstructured chemostats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000713-Helling1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000713-Rosenzweig1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, in temporally-structured batch cultures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000713-Spencer1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000713-Rozen1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, and in spatially-structured microcosms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000713-Rainey1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. In each setting, the emergence and persistence of polymorphism in the absence of sexual recombination seems to require that cohabitants exploit alternative ecological opportunities (i.e., unoccupied niche space), and/or accept trade-offs between being a specialist and a generalist (as reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000713-Rainey2">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000713-Zhong1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. In serial dilution batch culture multiple growth parameters can come under selection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000713-Rosenzweig2">&#x0005b;reviewed in 24&#x0005d;</xref>. Different clones may arise that have reduced lag time, increased maximum specific growth rate, or enhanced capacity to survive at high cell densities in the presence of low nutrients. Periodic changes in population density and nutrient levels may bring balancing selection to bear on these different phenotypes, especially if antagonistic pleiotropy precludes evolution of one fittest genotype having all of these advantageous traits. In spatially structured environments selection may favor mutants better adapted to particular regions or better able to colonize microhabitats formed at the boundaries between such regions. In continuous nutrient-limited environments (e.g., chemostats), theory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000713-Monod1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000713-Brown1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref> predicts that selection will favor clones better able to scavenge the limiting resource or more efficiently convert that resource to progeny. Ultimately, the outcome of the &#x0201c;evolutionary play&#x0201d; in any of these &#x0201c;ecological theaters&#x0201d; will depend on founder genotype, the complexity of genetic pathways which lead to different adaptive strategies, as well as the propensity of key steps along those pathways to undergo mutation and to act pleiotropically.</p><p>Only recently have we begun to discover genetic mechanisms that explain how balanced polymorphisms arise and persist in large, asexual populations. In serial batch culture, differences in the activity of the global regulator RpoS help explain co-existence of two <italic>E. coli</italic> isolates with different propensities to survive extended stationary phase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000713-Rozen2">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>; the precise genetic basis for these activity differences, however, remains obscure. In a spatially structured microcosm founded by a single clone of <italic>Pseudomonas fluorescens</italic>, a methylesterase structural mutant arose and persisted because the resulting change in exopolysaccharide production enabled the mutant to colonize the air-broth interface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000713-Bantinaki1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. Finally, in glucose-limited chemostats polymorphic <italic>E. coli</italic> populations repeatedly evolved, in part owing to local regulatory mutations that affect expression of a single operon (<italic>acs-actP-yjcH</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000713-Perrenoud1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. When adaptive clones from one such population were grown in monoculture, strain-specific differences in ca. 20&#x00025; of identifiable proteins expressed suggested the presence of other mutations with highly pleiotropic effects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000713-Kurlandzka1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, regardless of experimental system, uncertainty remains as to whether either regulatory or structural mutations consistently deliver greater fitness increments, which category of mutation better explains the maintenance of diversity, and whether one type is more likely to precede the other in an evolutionary sequence leading to balanced polymorphism.</p><p>Theoretical considerations have led some to argue that the major phenotypic changes which underlie adaptive radiation are more likely due to regulatory than to structural mutations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000713-Carroll1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000713-Wray1">&#x0005b;33 and refs. therein&#x0005d;</xref>. This argument is based on the perception that changes in coding sequences are more likely to have large pleiotropic effects than changes in the expression of those sequences, in particular changes that arise from the mutation of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements affecting single genes. In effect, this type of regulatory mutation enables selection more easily to &#x0201c;tinker&#x0201d; (<italic>sensu</italic> Jacob, 1977), as it provides a mechanism to alter functionality in one process while still preserving the role of pleiotropic genes in others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000713-Jacob1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. Also, and this fact too often goes unappreciated, a discrete <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory mutation preserves the capacity to restore the ancestral pattern of expression via compensatory or back-mutations. The proposition that regulatory mutations play a greater role in adaptive diversification has been criticized on empirical and theoretical grounds by Hoekstra and Coyne who point out the vastly greater number of examples where adaptation is attributable to structural rather regulatory mutations, as well as the facts that <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements offer much smaller targets for mutation than ORFs, and that in many species pleiotropic effects arising from structural mutations may be buffered by gene duplication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000713-Hoekstra1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>While the &#x0201c;<italic>cis</italic>-regulatory hypothesis&#x0201d; is based largely on a consideration of multicellular eukaryotes, tends to be focused on events that transpire during plant and animal development, and requires what we view to be an artificial distinction between physiological and morphological adaptation, it nevertheless provides a useful framework in which to make predictions about how adaptive diversification might occur in &#x02018;simpler&#x02019; species. In bacteria, both types of mutations can be evolutionarily significant. Structural mutations in the HopZ family of Type III secreted effector (T3SE) proteins play a major role in pathoadaptation by <italic>Pseudomonas syringae</italic> to its plant hosts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000713-Ma1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>; likewise, T3SE mutations underlie host immune suppression by <italic>Yersinia</italic> and <italic>Xanthomonas</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000713-Roden1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. On the other hand, pathoadaptation leading to an intracellular lifestyle in <italic>Samonella enterica</italic> results from a <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory mutation, specifically, acquisition of a binding site for pathogenicity island-2 regulator SsrB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000713-Osborne1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>We sought to address the issue of structural versus regulatory change in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> by investigating an experimental population first described by Helling et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000713-Helling1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. This population was founded by a single clone and evolved in an aerobic, glucose-limited chemostat at constant dilution rate (D&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.2 h<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) and constant temperature (30&#x000b0;C). Helling et al. inferred from fluctuations in a neutral marker that adaptive mutations occurred about once every 100 generations. At the time they concluded their experiment (765 generations) they could distinguish four strains on the basis of colony size and ampicillin sensitivity (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000713-t001">Table 1</xref>).

Acetate-scavenging strains were subsequently observed in 6 out of 12 independent evolutionary populations founded by cells of similar genetic background grown under similar conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000713-Treves1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The Helling and Adams population is a classic example of how adaptive evolution occurs in the context of niche diversification. Because the approximate number of fixed adaptive mutations is few and the number of significant changes in protein expression is many, this population is well-suited for identifying mutations that exert large effects, and determining whether those mutations occur at loci that encode enzymes in metabolism, at <italic>trans</italic>-acting loci that encode proteins which regulate expression of multiple enzymes, or at <italic>cis</italic>-acting sequences that control how activators and repressors act on single genes. We tested the hypothesis that enhanced uptake and assimilation of the primary resource, glucose, results from one (or few) early-arising mutations in <italic>trans</italic>-acting global regulators, and that specialization on secondary resources arises from later-arising mutations in key structural loci or in their <italic>cis</italic>-acting sequences. Lastly, we anticipated that in comparing the consortium's expression profile to that of individual members grown in monoculture, we would discover emergent properties of the system not apparent using a purely reductionist approach.</p><p>Transcriptional profiling of evolved strains in monoculture reveals &#x0223c;180 genes significantly altered in expression. Many shared increases and decreases are attributable to shared mutations in <italic>rpoS</italic> and the maltose operon operator <italic>mglO</italic>. Expression differences that distinguish isolates occur mainly in the majority clone, CV103. Many of these genes are regulated (or are predicted to be regulated) by cAMP receptor protein (CRP) and/or the global stress regulator CpxR. The &#x0201c;community&#x0201d; expression profile is strikingly similar to the monoculture profiles of the three sub-dominant clones, suggesting that biochemical interactions among clones alter CRP-CpxR regulation. We identified in the founder regulatory mutations in genes required for acetate and glycerol catabolism that likely predispose this system to the evolution of cross-feeding. Among adaptive clones, we found shared mutations in <italic>rpoS</italic> and <italic>mglO</italic>, and mutations that distinguish clones from one another at <sub>p</sub><italic>acs</italic>, <italic>malT</italic> and <italic>glpK</italic>. Taken together, our results suggest that both <italic>cis</italic>- and <italic>trans-</italic>regulatory changes underlie adaptive diversification in a simple, unstructured, resource-limited environment, and that founder genotype and chemical interactions among clones not only facilitate co-evolution, but also strongly impact their respective patterns of gene expression.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Bacterial strains</title><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000713-t001">Table 1</xref> summarizes previously published phenotypic data on the Helling et al. strains which are germane to interpretation of the expression and sequencing Results presented below <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000713-Helling1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000713-Rosenzweig1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Genomic characterization</title><p>To assess the level of large-scale genetic variation between the ancestor and the evolved clones, we performed rep-PCR fingerprinting and array-CGH.

Especially noteworthy note are the flagellar motor complex and flagellar hook gene transcripts, which are conspicuously down-regulated in CV103, but up-regulated in CV101, CV115 and CV116.

The genes primarily affected are those that distinguish CV103 from the other clones in the 4-class SAM analysis, suggesting that a global regulatory mechanism is responsible for the shift in expression. Two global regulators dominate the 4-class SAM analysis, CRP and CpxR; together these explain expression patterns for nearly half the transcription units which distinguish CV103. CRP is known or predicted to influence the expression of 23&#x00025; of CV103-specific transcription units, though none of these are under the exclusive control of CRP. While CpxR controls a smaller proportion of CV103-specifc transcription units, (19&#x00025;), most of these are <italic>solely</italic> regulated by CpxR.

When CV101 is present, acetate is efficiently scavenged and cannot accumulate.

CpxR is normally activated by its sensor kinase CpxA, but it can also be phosphorylated in a CpxA-independent manner, albeit at a rate of phosphotransfer much lower than that which occurs between the sensor kinase and its response regulator. Although there have been no reports of a direct connection between extracellular acetate concentration and CpxR activation, CpxR can be phosphorylated by acetyl-P, the high-energy intermediate of the Pta/AckA pathway that accumulates during exponential phase growth on glucose and/or a proposed sensor kinase (SKx) that is connected to the Pta-AckA pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000713-Keating1">&#x0005b;99&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000713-Wolfe2">&#x0005b;102&#x0005d;</xref>.

Increased glucose consumption coupled with acetate and glycerol secretion by CV103 created a favorable environment for the evolution of clones that could efficiently consume these two overflow metabolites. While screening for mutations that contributed to the emergence of cross-feeding populations, we unexpectedly encountered ancestral regulatory mutations in both the acetate and glycerol metabolic pathways that affect the induction of acetyl CoA synthestase (the primary acetate scavenging pathway) and the glycerol regulon repressor GlpR. As a result, it appears that the ancestor is unable to efficiently recover excreted acetate and constitutively overexpresses the glycerol regulon. We believe that these two mutations in the ancestor profoundly influenced the evolutionary outcome of these experiments (as well as the replicate evolution experiments reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000713-Treves1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>, which showed similar qualitative results). Impaired acetate scavenging by the progenitor of CV103 undoubtedly accelerated or predisposed the evolution of a strain that could efficiently utilize this substrate.

The influence of the ancestral GlpR mutation is less clear: Overexpression of the glycerol dissimilation pathway could affect the excretion of glycerol-3-phosphate by CV103 or enhance the ability CV116 to recover it.

Initial selection in the chemostat favored mutations that enhance competitive acquisition of the limiting resource (such as those in <italic>rpoS</italic> and <italic>mgl</italic>), but ancestral regulatory mutations like those in <italic>acs</italic> and perhaps <italic>glpR</italic> explain much of the unique behavior of this system. The transcriptional effect of some adaptations was apparent even when consortium members were grown in isolation, while the expression of others appeared to depend on the metabolic activity of sibling clones. Finally, even under strong selection, at least one of the most beneficial mutations served to restore a lost function, thereby creating a stable cross-feeding interaction between adaptive clones.</p></sec><sec id="s4f"><title>Conclusion/summary</title><p>The advantages of <italic>E. coli</italic> as a model organism for experimental evolution lie in its ease of cultivation, large population sizes, rich history of investigation, and perceived simplicity of adaptive response. An attempt to understand how one <italic>E. coli</italic> clone adapts to a single environmental factor led to the unexpected discovery that out of one can come many (<italic>e unum pluribus</italic>), and that biological diversity can evolve and endure even under the simplest conditions.</p><p>The mutations which we have so far discovered that help to explain this phenomenon localize to transcription factors or <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory regions, emphasizing the profound influence of differential gene regulation on adaptive evolution. Out of necessity, previous efforts to analyze this microbiological consortium relied upon the assumption that the sum of the individual units was mechanistically equal to the behavior of the whole. And indeed, detailed analysis of each member in isolation provided useful information about both their shared evolutionary history and individual adaptive strategies. However, treating the intact consortium as a single unit revealed a transcriptomic behavior that was clearly different from a simple aggregation of its &#x0201c;atomized&#x0201d; parts (<italic>sensu</italic> Gould and Lewontin, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000713-Gould1">&#x0005b;106&#x0005d;</xref>). Future experiments which rely on advances in whole genome sequencing, cell labeling and cell sorting will enable us to dissect the consortium into its individual components prior to analysis, and precisely identify the characteristics that define each clone's adaptive strategy. The challenge of deconvoluting individual metabolic responses in this system underscores the complexity of even a simple three-membered &#x0201c;community.&#x0201d; Our finding that the sum activities of the community do not strictly equal its parts makes clear that experimental microbial evolution is a powerful tool to study the evolution of emergent properties in complex biological systems.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s5"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s5a"><title>Strains, media, and culture conditions</title><p><italic>Escherichia coli</italic> JA122, CV101, CV103, CV115 and CV116 were stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C in 20&#x00025; glycerol (See <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000713-t001">Table 1</xref>).
