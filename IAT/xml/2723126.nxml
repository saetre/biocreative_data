Regulatory T cells (Tregs), and IDO, an immunosuppressive enzyme, are associated with more advanced disease in some cancers and may promote immunologic tolerance to tumors.

The proportion IDO<sup>+ </sup>cell in SLN of cancer patients was not statistically different than controls (4.0% v. 1.6%, p = 0.08). In order to demonstrate the combined immunosuppressive effect of Foxp3 and IDO, we categorized each SLN as positive or negative for Foxp3 and IDO.

As IDO has been found to promote differentiation of Tregs, IDO may become a suitable target to abrogate the development of T-cell tolerance and to promote an effective immune response to breast cancer. Our results about the combined expression of IDO and Foxp3 in metastastic SLN support this assumption.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>By the time cancer is clinically detectable tumors have likely developed mechanisms to escape immunosurveillance, and increasing evidence suggests that regulatory T-cells (Tregs) have a major role in modulating host response to tumor. Tregs are produced in the thymus and they act in the periphery to control potentially hazardous self-reactive effector cells that have escaped thymic negative selection[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The exact mechanism of suppression is not yet determined; however, direct cellular contact is required. Regardless, it has been shown that accumulation of Tregs in tumor, as measured by Foxp3 expression, has been associated with a worse prognosis in patients with ovarian cancer[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. In esophageal and gastric cancers higher populations of tumor infiltrating Tregs were associated with more advance disease[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Further evidence for the role of Tregs in tumor-specific immunosuppression is seen in murine models where depletion of Tregs promotes an effective antitumor response[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>Indolamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) is a tryptophan degrading-enzyme that inhibits T-cell proliferation. IDO is expressed by trophoblasts, dendritic cells[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and macrophages[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. IDO has been found to prevent fetal rejection[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], and it is suspected that it may promote tolerance to tumors[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. There is evidence that there is increased expression of IDO in the primary tumor and serum of patients with breast cancer[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], and that higher levels of IDO expression in colorectal carcinoma represent a poor prognostic factor[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Additionally, expression of IDO by leukemic cells in acute myeloid leukemia has been shown to induce Foxp3<sup>+ </sup>Tregs[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The role of IDO has been considered relevant enough that inhibitors of IDO are being developed for clinical trials[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. These inhibitors could potentially demonstrate utility in breast cancer if IDO promotes progression of disease.</p><p>Metastasis to lymph nodes is one of the strongest predictors of survival in patients with breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Axillary clearance for lymph node evaluation has been replaced by sentinel lymph node biopsy at many centers in the setting of the appropriate clinical stage[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Improved selectivity in lymph node dissection has resulted in a more detailed analysis of the removed nodes, and greater attention is being paid to the immune status of these nodes. Sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) are unique in that they represent both the sites of T-cell activation and early metastasis. As such, these nodes are ideal for investigations of tumor immunology in breast cancer.</p><p>Recent reports have shown that the immune systems of patients with breast cancer are dysfunctional[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Therefore, we set out to find evidence of immunosuppression in the SLN of patients with breast cancer. We hypothesized that the expression of Foxp3 and IDO within SLN were associated with nodal metastasis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>We used SLN of 47 breast cancer patients treated at the Breast Surgery Unit of Helsinki University Hospital between 2001 and 2003. A prospectively collected database was searched to select patients with node negative disease as well as micro- and macro-metastasis. Another criterion was to include patients that also had non-SLN harvested. These patients had either tumor negative SLN (n = 11), SLN with micrometastases (n = 16), or SLN with macrometastases (n = 20) as defined by the International Union Against Cancer (UICC) TNM classification system[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The clinicopathological data of the breast cancer patients included in this study are summarized in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>. SLN from 10 control patients with SLN biopsy due to a false-positive preoperative biopsy, either core needle biopsy or fine needle aspiration cytology, were used as controls. These control patients had premalignant conditions such as lobular neoplasia in situ or atypical ductal hyperplasia, but not ductal carcinoma in situ or invasive breast cancer.

For antigen retrieval, samples were microwaved for a total of 20 minutes in a citrate buffer (pH = 6). Endogenous peroxidase activity was quenched in a bath of methanol and hydrogen peroxide for 30 minutes.

Previous studies have pointed out that tumor infiltrating Foxp3<sup>+ </sup>Tregs may influence the clinical course of breast cancer. Bates and co-workers[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] quantified Foxp3<sup>+ </sup>Tregs in primary ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and invasive breast cancer and found that higher numbers of Foxp3<sup>+ </sup>Tregs in patients with DCIS correlated with increased risk of relapse. Furthermore, in patients with invasive breast cancers, infiltration of the primary tumors with Tregs was associated with lymph node involvement and increased risk of relapse after five years. Interestingly, a recent study by Ladoire[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] demonstrated that clinical response to neoadjuvant therapy with an anthracycline-based regimen was associated with a clearance of Foxp3<sup>+ </sup>cells from primary tumors. This finding indicates that the immune system may be involved in eradication of cancer cells in the context of cytotoxic chemotherapy.</p><p>Our results demonstrating Foxp3<sup>+ </sup>cell infiltration within metastatic SLN of breast cancer patients are in line with other studies that correlate high numbers of Tregs with a metastatic and invasive growth pattern of cancer. In addition to breast cancer, Tregs may have a role in many other cancers. In metastatic lymph nodes of patients with melanoma there are higher frequencies of Tregs than in tumor-free lymph nodes[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. In contrast, in ovarian cancer fewer Tregs were found in lymph nodes from patients with advanced stage disease than in earlier stages; however, accumulation in tumor and ascites was correlated with more advance stage[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. In our patient population an association between accumulation of Foxp3<sup>+ </sup>cells in SLN and distant recurrence (data not shown) was not observed. This may not be surprising, since most of our patients had tumors with favorable prognostic factors such that the number of relapses has remained low. Also, follow-up time was too short to evaluate recurrences after five years. Our findings are also supported by Matsuura[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] who used quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-polymer chain reaction to find significantly higher levels of expression of Foxp3 mRNA in SLN with metastasis than in those without.</p><p>It has recently been shown that IDO expression by plasmacytoid dendritic cells promotes differentiation of Foxp3<sup>+ </sup>Tregs[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Furthermore, the expression of IDO has been correlated with an increase of Foxp3<sup>+ </sup>cells in multiple murine models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], in human pancreatic adenocarcinoma[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], in human uterine cervical carcinoma[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], and in humans with advanced stages of melanoma following vaccination[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Even though few IDO<sup>+ </sup>cells were found in the Foxp3<sup>+</sup>-rich paracortical regions of SLN, IDO depletes tryptophan and may have regional effect. Reduced levels of tryptophan activate the amino acid sensitive GCN2-kinase pathway and result in activation of Tregs[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Accordingly, cell-to-cell contact may not be necessary for IDO<sup>+ </sup>cells to exert their effect. It is uncertain if the upregulation of Tregs may be strictly due to IDO, or tumor or if another mechanism exists.</p><p>Based on these reports, we studied the proportion of IDO<sup>+ </sup>cells in SLN of our patients. Similar to Foxp3 expression, SLN from breast cancer patients contained higher numbers of IDO producing cells; however, the difference between cancer and control patients was not statistically significant, and IDO expression did not predict nodal status in a regression analysis. In tumor-free SLN of breast cancer patients and in controls a correlation between Foxp3<sup>+ </sup>and IDO<sup>+ </sup>cells was observed. In contrast, no correlation was found in metastatic lymph nodes suggesting that the infiltration of breast cancer cells into SLN interferes with the dependence of IDO and Foxp3 on each other. The expression of IDO may attract or induce Foxp3<sup>+ </sup>cells prior to nodal metastasis. Localization of IDO<sup>+ </sup>cells was not influenced by tumor cell invasion as IDO<sup>+ </sup>cells were found in perisinusoidal areas in nonmetastatic and metastatic SLN. In melanoma patients IDO expression in SLN has been linked with the immunosuppressive cytokine IL-10. In these SLN the expression of IDO and IL-10 was found to be highest in SLN that were infiltrated with melanoma cells[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Another study also found greater levels of expression of IL-10, IFN-&#x003b3;, and IDO in SLN with metastasis than non-SLN in patients with melanoma[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p><p>Concurrent expression of IDO and Foxp3 in SLN correlated well with lymph node metastasis. Only 1 out of 12 patients that had high numbers of Foxp3<sup>+ </sup>and IDO<sup>+ </sup>cells in SLN had node negative disease. Furthermore, most cases of node negative disease and almost all of the controls were in the group with low numbers of Foxp3<sup>+ </sup>and IDO<sup>+ </sup>cells. This finding suggests that IDO may be involved with the induction of T-cell tolerance in these patients. However, regression analysis did not demonstrate a combined predictive effect of Foxp3 and IDO on nodal status. This indicates that the effect of IDO may be masked by the strong influence of Foxp3<sup>+ </sup>cells in the present material.</p><p>In this study, immunohistochemistry was used for analysis. Although IHC may be less sensitive and more subjective in the interpretation than PCR, it allows lymph node structure to be taken into consideration during analysis. Due to the use of IHC, we were able to analyze non-metastatic regions of SLN whereas PCR does not distinguish between expression by tumors and immunocytes. The morphological appearance and distribution of Foxp3<sup>+ </sup>as well as IDO<sup>+ </sup>cells in the lymph node attests to the quality and reliability of the staining. We found that Foxp3<sup>+ </sup>cells were small lymphocytes located in the typical T-cell areas, while the IDO<sup>+ </sup>cells were morphologically macrophages located at perisinusoidal areas.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, our study shows that Foxp3<sup>+ </sup>cells are associated with more advanced disease in breast cancer, a finding that is proving to be true in many other cancers. As IDO has been found to promote differentiation of Tregs, IDO may become a suitable target to abrogate the development of T-cell tolerance and to promote an effective immune response to breast cancer. Our results about the combined expression of IDO and Foxp3 in metastastic SLN support this assumption.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>SLN: sentinel lymph nodes; Tregs: regulatory T-cells; IDO: indolamine 2,3-dioxygenase; DCIS: ductal carcinoma in situ; ER: estrogen receptor; PR: progesterone receptor; MIB-1: proliferation index.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>AM, JV, PH, KvS, and ML participated in the concept and design of the study.
