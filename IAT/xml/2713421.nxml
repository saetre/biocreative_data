Besides these roles, additional functions in the control of immune response have been suggested. In the present study we investigated the consequences of loss of Rb in viral infection. Here we show that virus replication is increased by the absence of Rb, and that Rb is required for the activation of the NF-kB pathway in response to virus infection. These results reveal a novel role for tumor suppressor Rb in viral infection surveillance and further extend the concept of a link between tumor suppressors and antiviral activity.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The Rb family of pocket proteins comprises three members Rb, p107 and p130 that have unique and overlapping functions in cell cycle control, differentiation and inhibition of oncogenic transformation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006422-Classon1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition to its classical role in the control of cell progression, the influence of Rb on immune response was also proposed. In this sense, a significant fraction of genes associated with processes related to immune responses, particularly those induced by pathogens or injuries including cell surface molecules, complement factors and genes involved in interferon (IFN) system, are down-regulated in Rb knockout cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006422-Lu1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006422-Osborne1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006422-Zhu1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006422-Eason1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, transforming viral agents contain oncoproteins that inactivate Rb and strikingly, these tumor cells are more susceptible to virus infection than normal cells. Moreover, activation of Rb by IFN treatment has been reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006422-Moiseeva1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006422-Resnitzky1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006422-Sangfelt1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. All together these results suggest that targeting Rb by viral proteins may serve as an advantage for viral replication.</p><p>Nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB) is a critical regulator of the immediate early pathogen response, playing an important role in promoting inflammation and in the regulation of cell proliferation and survival <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006422-Karin1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006422-Li1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. In most cells NF-kB exists as an inactive cytoplasmic complex, whose predominant form is a heterodimer composed of p50 and RelA/p65 subunits, bound to inhibitory proteins of the IkB family. The inactive NF-kB complex is activated in response to a variety of stimuli, including viral and bacterial infections, exposure to proinflammatory cytokines, mitogens and growth factors, and stress-inducing agents <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006422-Hiscott1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006422-Karin2">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, which activate the inhibitory kB kinases (IKK). One of these kinases, IKK&#x003b2;, phosphorylates IkB&#x003b1;, causing its poly-ubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the 26S proteasome. The release of NF-kB from its inhibitor IkB&#x003b1;, allows its nuclear translocation and transactivation of NF-kB target genes. Since gene expression of many proinflammatory and antiviral cytokines is controlled by this factor, the concept emerged that NF-kB and its upstream regulator IKK are essential components of the innate antiviral immune response to infectious pathogens.</p><p>In this report, we have analyzed the role of the tumor suppressor Rb in the control of virus replication. We demonstrate that the absence of Rb, but not of related proteins p107 or p130, increases virus replication and that Rb is involved in the activation of the antiviral NF-kB pathway. These results identify a new function for the tumor suppressor Rb establishing a new link between viral infection and tumor suppression.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results and Discussion</title><p>Mammalian cells respond to viral infection by producing and secreting type I IFN that triggers the expression or post-translational modification of hundreds of cellular genes some of which are implicated in tumor and viral protective networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006422-Takaoka1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006422-Garcia1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006422-Regad1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006422-Bernardi1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006422-MunozFontela1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>.

Viral production from WT cells was around one log lower than from TKO cells (supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006422.s001">Figure S1A</xref>), indicating that absence of Rb family proteins facilitates viral infection. To test individual requirements, similar experiments were performed in MEFs derived from Rb<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>, p107<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>, p130<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> or WT mice. Single Rb<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells showed around one log higher VSV production than MEFs from littermate WT animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006422-g001">Figure 1A</xref>, left panel). In contrast, no differences were observed between the amount of viral progeny recovered from p130<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>, p107<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> or WT cells (supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006422.s001">Figure S1B</xref>). These data indicate that removing Rb alone from cells increases VSV replication. These results were confirmed through the measurements of the cytopathic effect. Rb<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> or WT cells were infected with VSV at different M.O.I. and 24 h after infection cytopathic effect was evaluated. A clear decrease in cell survival was observed after infection of Rb<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> derived MEFs in comparison with WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006422-g001">Figure 1A</xref>, right panel). In contrast, an increase in cytopathic effect was not observed in p107<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>or p130<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> compared with WT derived MEFs (supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006422.s002">Figure S2</xref>). In agreement with these data, the lack of Rb resulted in an increase in viral protein synthesis. MEFs were infected with VSV at a M.O.I. of 0.5 and viral protein synthesis was analyzed at various times after infection. A stronger synthesis of VSV proteins was detected in Rb<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells, in comparison with WT MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006422-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). All together these data demonstrate that absence of Rb but not p107 or p130 enhances VSV replication. Next, in order to determine if the absence of Rb has also a benefitial effect on the replication of other viruses, we quantified virus progeny after extensive cell killing of WT or Rb<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> MEFs by infection with encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV; picornavirus RNA positive strand), sindbis virus (similar to VSV, RNA negative strand virus) or vaccinia virus (DNA virus) at M.O.I. of 5.

These results suggest that the contribution of Rb to the control of virus infection differs depending on the virus.</p><fig id="pone-0006422-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0006422.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Rb<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> MEFs are more susceptible to virus infection.</title><p>A, Rb<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> or WT MEFs were infected in duplicate with VSV at M.O.I. of 5 and a quantification of the virus yield after a total destruction of the monolayers was assessed (left panel).

The initial key segment of the NF-kB activation pathway involves IKK activation, IKK phosphorylation of IkB&#x003b1;, and consequent IkB&#x003b1; degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006422-Baldwin1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. Analysis of the activation of this pathway was then carried out in WT or Rb<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells. Cells were infected with VSV at M.O.I. of 5 and at different times after infection, IkB phosphorylation and IkB degradation were assessed by Western-blotting. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006422-g002">Figure 2A</xref>, IkB phosphorylation was detected by 2 h after VSV infection in WT cells. In agreement with these results IkB&#x003b1; degradation was evident by 3 h after VSV infection of WT cells and was complete by 5 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006422-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). In parallel, analysis of Rb<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells revealed a basal level of phosphorylated IkB that was slightly increased between 1 and 4 hpi. However, no degradation of IkB was detected at any time after VSV infection of Rb<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells, indicating Rb-dependent IkB degradation in response to VSV infection. The second key segment of the NF-kB activation pathway is nuclear translocation of NF-kB subunits and their dimerization and binding to the kB enhancer. Nuclear translocation of NF-kB in response to VSV infection, as a consequence of IkB degradation, was then tested in both WT and Rb<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> MEFs by immunofluorescence. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006422-g002">Figure 2B</xref>, nuclear translocation of the p65 subunit of NF-kB was clearly detected at 8 h after infection in WT cells. However, most of the Rb<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells showed cytoplasmic staining for p65 at 8 hpi, confirming that VSV-induced nuclear translocation of p65 was also dependent on Rb. The NF-kB transcription factor promotes the expression of many different genes implicated in the antiviral response. To explore the correlation between the nuclear translocation of NF-kB and the induction of NF-kB targets, upregulation of TNF-&#x003b1; or IFN-&#x003b2; genes at 12 h after VSV infection, in WT and Rb<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> MEFs was measured. Semiquantitative RT-PCR showed that relative TNF-&#x003b1; gene transcription levels in non-infected Rb<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells was similar to that detected in WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006422-g002">Figure 2C</xref>, left panel). Interestingly, a downregulation of the steady-state levels of IFN-&#x003b2; mRNA in Rb<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells in comparison with WT cells was found (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006422-g002">Figure 2C</xref>, left panel), as it has been reported for the interferon-induced Ifi202 gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006422-Xin1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. Reduced transactivation of both TNF-&#x003b1; and IFN-&#x003b2; in Rb<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells in response to VSV infection was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006422-g002">Figure 2C</xref>, right panel). The impairment of IFN-&#x003b2; production in the absence of Rb after VSV infection was confirmed at the protein level by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006422-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). These data indicate that a defect in the activation of the NF-kB pathway and, consequently, in the production of IFN-&#x003b2; in Rb<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> MEFs may explain their increased susceptibility to VSV infection. Activation of NF-kB and eIF2-&#x003b1; by VSV occur in a dsRNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR)-dependent manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006422-Balachandran1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006422-Chu1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. Analysis of PKR activation in Rb<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and WT MEFs in response to VSV infection revealed decreased levels of both phospho-PKR and phospho-eI2F-&#x003b1; proteins in Rb<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006422-g002">Figure 2E</xref>).

Analysis of IRF3 activation in WT or Rb<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> MEFs at different times after VSV infection show phosphorylation of IRF3 in both WT and Rb<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells (Supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006422.s003">Figure S3</xref>). This result reinforces the idea that the NF-kB pathway is the mediator of the reduced sensitivity to virus infection observed in the Rb<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells.</p><p>NF-kB activation during viral infection has been interpreted as a protective response of the host to the viral pathogen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006422-Santoro1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. Consequently, one would expect that molecules interfering with the NF-kB pathway would have antiviral activity. Thus, we tested the assumption that reconstitution of Rb<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells would recover IkB degradation in response to virus infection and would increase control of virus replication. We reintroduced Rb into Rb<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> MEFs by expressing the full-length mouse protein from a retroviral construct and analyzed the development of cytopathic effect. Interestingly, transduction of Rb<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> MEFs with a vector expressing GFP increased the resistance of the cells to be infected by VSV, likely due to the stress involved by three successive rounds of retrovirus transduction. However, expression of Rb increased even higher the resistance of the Rb<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> MEFs to develop cytophatic effect after VSV infection, to similar extent to that observed in the WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006422-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). Similarly, lower viral titer from reconstituted cells was obtained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006422-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). These data demonstrate that the virus-sensitive phenotype of Rb<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> is directly associated with the absence of Rb. In addition, MEFs transduced with Rb showed some degradation of IkB at 3 h after infection that was increased at 7 h, while no clear degradation was detected in the Rb<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells transduced with a vector expressing GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006422-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). Together these results indicate that Rb has a role in the control of virus infection and that Rb is required for the degradation of IkB in response to virus infection, strongly supporting the NF-kB pathway as the mediator of the antiviral activity induced by Rb.</p><fig id="pone-0006422-g004" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0006422.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Reconstitution of Rb<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> MEFs increases resistance to VSV infection.</title><p>A, MEFs WT, Rb<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>, and Rb<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> MEFs transduced with retroviral vectors encoding for Rb or GFP were infected with VSV at the indicated M.O.I.
