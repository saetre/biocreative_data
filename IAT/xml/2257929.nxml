Furthermore, skeletal muscles can adapt individual myofibers under various circumstances, such as disease and exercise, by changing fiber types. This study was performed to examine the influence of dystrophin deficiency on fiber type composition of skeletal muscles in canine X-linked muscular dystrophy in Japan (CXMD<sub>J</sub>), a large animal model for Duchenne muscular dystrophy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>We used tibialis cranialis (TC) muscles and diaphragms of normal dogs and those with CXMD<sub>J </sub>at various ages from 1 month to 3 years old.

In populations of muscle fibers expressing fast and/or slow MHC(s) but not developmental MHC of CXMD<sub>J </sub>muscles, slow MHC fibers were predominant in number and showed selective enlargement. Especially, in CXMD<sub>J </sub>diaphragms, the proportions of slow MHC fibers were significantly larger in populations of myofibers with non-expression of developmental MHC. Analyses of MHC isoforms also indicated a marked increase of type I and decrease of type IIA isoforms in the affected diaphragm at ages over 6 months. In addition, expression of developmental (embryonic and/or neonatal) MHC decreased in the CXMD<sub>J </sub>diaphragm in adults, in contrast to continuous high-level expression in affected TC muscle.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The CXMD<sub>J </sub>diaphragm showed marked changes in fiber type composition unlike TC muscles, suggesting that the affected diaphragm may be effectively adapted toward dystrophic stress by switching to predominantly slow fibers. Furthermore, the MHC expression profile in the CXMD<sub>J </sub>diaphragm was markedly different from that in <italic>mdx </italic>mice, indicating that the dystrophic dog is a more appropriate model than a murine one, to investigate the mechanisms of respiratory failure in DMD.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is an X-linked, lethal disorder of skeletal muscle caused by mutations in the dystrophin gene, which encodes a large sub-sarcolemmal cytoskeletal protein, dystrophin. DMD is characterized by a high incidence (1 in 3,500 boys) and a high frequency of <italic>de novo </italic>mutation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The absence of dystrophin is accompanied by the loss of dystrophin-associated glycoprotein complex from the sarcolemma, leading to reduce membrane stability of myofibers. This dysfunction results in progressive muscle weakness, cardiomyopathy, and subsequent early death by respiratory or heart failure in DMD patients.</p><p>For basic and therapeutic studies of DMD, it is very important to perform analysis and evaluation using dystrophin-deficient animal models, such as the <italic>mdx </italic>mouse and dystrophic dog. The <italic>mdx </italic>mouse has been well utilized in many DMD studies, but the murine model shows moderate dystrophic changes unlike severe human DMD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. In contrast, golden retriever muscular dystrophy (GRMD) shows similar dystrophic phenotypes to those of human patients: elevated serum CK level, gross muscle atrophy with joint contracture, cardiomyopathy, prominent muscle necrosis, degeneration with mineralization and concurrent regeneration, and endomysial and perimysial fibrosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Therefore, the dystrophic dog is more suitable than the <italic>mdx </italic>mouse for studies to gain insight into the pathogenic and molecular biological mechanisms of human DMD, as well as for pre-clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Therefore, we have recently established a colony of beagle-based canine X-linked muscular dystrophy in Japan (CXMD<sub>J</sub>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], and have demonstrated that CXMD<sub>J </sub>also exhibited severe symptoms similar to GRMD. To date, we have utilized the littermates of the CXMD<sub>J </sub>colony for pathological [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], molecular biological [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], and therapeutic examinations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] of DMD.</p><p>Skeletal muscles are composed of heterogeneous populations of muscle fiber types, which contribute to a variety of functional capabilities. In addition, muscle fibers can adapt to diverse situations, such as aging, exercise, and muscular diseases, by changing fiber size or fiber type composition. Therefore, it is important to analyze fiber types to evaluate the condition of skeletal muscle with disease. Fiber types can be distinguished by biochemical, metabolic, morphological, and physiological properties. One of the most informative methods for identification of fiber types is detection of myosin heavy chain (MHC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Myofibers express various MHC isoforms containing slow (type I), fast (types IIA, IIX, IIB), embryonic, and neonatal forms. MHC expression, however, seems to differ between animal species and muscle types. Three MHC isoforms (types I, IIA, and IIX) have been identified in limb skeletal muscles of human and dog, while the fourth isoform, MHC IIB, is abundantly present in small mammals including mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In addition, expression profiles of MHCs in dystrophin-deficient muscles have been widely examined in limb skeletal muscles of DMD patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and animal models, such as the <italic>mdx </italic>mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and GRMD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], but it has not been fully analyzed in skeletal muscles of a canine model. Furthermore, expanded studies of the diaphragm were restricted to that of the <italic>mdx </italic>mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Therefore, it is important to perform detailed evaluation of fiber types and fiber sizes in limb skeletal muscles and the diaphragm of CXMD<sub>J </sub>to understand adaptations toward disease by changes in fiber type composition in the skeletal muscles of human DMD.</p><p>In this study, to investigate fiber types of myofibers in dystrophin-deficient skeletal muscles of dystrophic dogs, we evaluated the expression profiles of MHCs in tibialis cranialis (TC) muscles and diaphragms of CXMD<sub>J </sub>at various ages, by immunohistochemical and electrophoretic techniques. Briefly, we detected myofibers expressing fast type, slow type, and/or developmental MHCs. In addition, the numbers of fast or slow MHC fibers and the size distribution of these myofibers were analyzed among populations of muscle fibers with or without developmental MHC. The composition of MHC isoforms was also examined in pairs of normal and affected dogs at various ages. This is the first report of evaluation of the detailed distribution of fiber types in TC muscles and diaphragms of dystrophic dogs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>Experimental dogs were wild-type and dystrophic littermates at ages from 1 month to 3 years, from the beagle-based CXMD<sub>J </sub>breeding colony at National Center of Neurology and Psychiatry (Tokyo, Japan) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Within a few days after birth, the genotypes (wild-type, carrier, or dystrophy) of the littermates were determined by a snapback method of single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], and the phenotypes were also confiermed by measuring serum CK level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. All animals were cared for and treated in accordance with the guidelines approved by Ethics Committee for Treatment of Laboratory Animals at NCNP, where three fundamental principles (replacement, reduction, and refinement) were also considered. Adult control and CXMD<sub>J </sub>dogs (10 months to 3 years) were analyzed in early experiments (three to six animals). Series consisting of a pair of a normal dog and an affected littermate at ages of 1, 2, 4, 6 months, or 1 year old were examined in subsequent experiments. TC muscles and diaphragms were removed from the dogs after necropsy, in which euthanasia was performed by exsanguination under anesthesia with isoflurane taken to prevent unnecessary pain. TC muscle was used as a representative limb skeletal muscle, and it corresponds to the tibialis anterior muscle in mice and humans. The muscle blocks were divided into pieces and frozen immediately in isopentane pre-cooled with liquid nitrogen.</p></sec><sec><title>Histological and immunohistochemical analysis</title><p>Serial transverse cryosections (10 &#x003bc;m thick) were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&#x00026;E), and immunostained using anti-MHC antibodies. Immunohistochemistry was performed as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Cryosections were incubated with the following primary antibodies: mouse monoclonal antibodies against fast type MHC (NCL-MHCf; Novocastra), slow type MHC (NCL-MHCs), and developmental MHC (NCL-MHCd). The primary antibodies were detected using a Vectastain<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>ABC kit (Vector Laboratories) and then visualized with diaminobenzidine. Images were recorded using a microscope (Eclipse E600; Nikon) equipped with a CCD camera (HV-D28S; Hitachi), and fiber types of individual myofibers from 400 to 1200 per muscle were identified, based on serial sections immunostained with three types of MHC antibodies. Subsequently, the fiber number of each group was counted, and fiber sizes were also measured using Image-Pro Plus (Media Cybernetics). Furthermore, the differences in MHC expression between two groups (normal, dMHC (-) <italic>vs </italic>affected, dMHC (-); affected, dMHC (-) <italic>vs </italic>affected, dMHC (+)), between muscles (TC muscle <italic>vs </italic>diaphragm), or among ages (1, 2, 4, 6 months, and 1 year) were evaluated by Yates's chi-square test.</p></sec><sec><title>Myosin extraction and gel separation</title><p>Myosin was extracted on ice for 60 min from cryosections, as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].

In H&#x00026;E-stained sections, affected muscles exhibited some dystrophic characteristics, such as necrosis, regeneration, cellular infiltration, fibrosis, fiber splitting, and fiber size variation.

In TC muscles and diaphragms of adult normal dogs, individual myofibers showed expression of either fast or slow type MHC. In affected TC muscles, the proportions of fast or slow MHC fibers were similar between normal and affected muscles. In addition, large numbers of developmental MHC-expressing fibers were observed in clusters, and many of these fibers co-expressed fast type MHC. In the affected diaphragms, the numbers of fast MHC fibers were much lower than in the normal counterparts, and slow type MHC was expressed in almost all fibers. Furthermore, the numbers of developmental MHC fibers were less than in affected TC muscle, and almost all of these fibers co-expressed slow type MHC, unlike TC muscle. These results indicated that the influences of dystrophin deficiency on MHC expression are significantly different between TC muscle and the diaphragm of CXMD<sub>J</sub>, suggesting that the diaphragm would be more greatly influenced with regard to the composition of fiber types and muscle regeneration than TC muscle.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>The size distribution of myofibers expressing fast and/or slow type MHCs in skeletal muscles of a normal (10 months old) or a CXMD<sub>J </sub>dog (11 months old)</bold>.

Furthermore, fast (white), hybrid (gray), or slow MHC myofibers (black) were analyzed among populations of muscle fibers with non-expression of developmental MHC (A, B) or with expression of developmental MHC (C) in terms of fiber numbers (see Table 1) and fiber sizes (A-C).

Four MHC isoforms (I, IIA, IIX, and embryonic), which migrated on electrophoresis as IIA-embryonic-IIX-I from slowest to fastest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], were detected in canine skeletal muscles (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>). In affected TC muscles, type I, IIA, and embryonic isoforms were consistently detected at similar levels, but the level of type IIX MHC was lower than those in normal TC muscles after 2 months old. In contrast, type IIA MHC level decreased gradually in affected diaphragms with growth, and type I accounted for the majority of MHC components in animals over 6 months old. In addition, the embryonic isoform decreased in affected diaphragms after 6 months old. These results were consistent with those of immunohistochemical analyses (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). These observations suggested that type IIX and IIA fast fibers may be preferentially affected in TC muscle and diaphragm of CXMD<sub>J</sub>, respectively. Furthermore, these observations suggested that muscle regeneration may deteriorate from relatively younger age in the affected diaphragm, unlike TC muscle.</p><fig position="float" id="F7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p><bold>MHC isoforms in skeletal muscles of normal and CXMD<sub>J </sub>dogs</bold>.

Our results indicated that the influences of dystrophin deficiency on fiber type composition were significantly different between TC muscle and diaphragm.</p><p>To analyze MHC expression in details, we compared fiber type composition and fiber size distribution of MHC-expressing fibers between a normal dog (10 months old) and an affected dog (11 months old). In normal and affected dogs, body weight rapidly increased to approximately 9 kg at 4 months old, and then slightly increased to approximately 14 and 11 kg at 12 months old, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. As body weight reflects muscle weight, muscle mass and fiber size would not extremely change in 1 month after 4 months old, especially in normal dogs. In fact, in TC muscles or diaphragms of normal dogs, there were no significant differences among compositions of fiber types and MHC isoforms after 4 months old (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). In addition, we examined normal dogs at 11, 12 and 14 months old, and affected dogs at 10, 12, 13 and 15 months old. Normal muscles of adult dogs showed similar expression of fast type, slow type, or developmental MHC at all adult ages, and affected muscles also showed similar MHC expression at examined ages (data not shown). These observations implied that there would be no significant difference in MHC expression between at 10 and 11 months old, in both of normal and affected dogs.</p><sec><title>Common features between TC muscle and diaphragm of CXMD<sub>J</sub></title><p>TC muscle and diaphragm of CXMD<sub>J </sub>shared the features that slow MHC fibers increased and enlarged selectively in non-regenerating populations, while fast type IIX or IIA MHC isoform decreased. Similar observations have been reported in skeletal muscles of the <italic>mdx </italic>mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], GRMD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], and human DMD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. In general, increasing and enlarging of slow fibers may be a consequence of adaptive responses by metabolic enzyme systems and energy consumption, because slow fibers have lower capacity for power output and consume less energy than fast fibers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Our results also supported the hypothesis that slow fibers would be more adaptable to dystrophic stress than fast fibers, to compensate for the reduced abilities of muscle function.</p><p>Two mechanisms were considered to explain the selective increase in slow fibers during progressive muscle degeneration. One possibility is that slow fibers may be more resistant to dystrophic stress than fast fibers, leading to selective survival of slow fibers. This was supported by the observation that slower muscle fibers contained significantly more utrophin, a homolog of dystrophin, in comparison to faster counterparts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Another is transition of MHC isoforms, where type IIA or IIX MHC isoforms could be transited to type I, as seen in hypertrophy and exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. MHC I, IIa, IIx, and IIb gene expression are known to be regulated by the calcineurin pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Dystrophin deficiency may accelerate MHC transition to slower types <italic>via </italic>calcineurin/NFAT signaling in skeletal muscles of CXMD<sub>J</sub>, because calcineurin and activated NFATc1 protein content were higher in muscles from <italic>mdx </italic>than wild-type mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. However, it remains possible that both mechanisms may be active at the same time, because the calcineurin/NFAT cascade can regulate not only the MHC promoters but also the utrophin A promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Differences between TC muscle and diaphragm of CXMD<sub>J</sub></title><p>The CXMD<sub>J </sub>diaphragm developed severe degenerative lesions from earlier stages than TC muscle, which corresponded to previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. In addition, dystrophic changes in the CXMD<sub>J </sub>diaphragm not only markedly altered the expression of fast and slow type MHCs but also decreased the amount of the developmental (embryonic and/or neonatal) MHC with growth, unlike affected TC muscle. Especially, fast MHC fibers disappeared and slow MHC fibers enlarged in the adult CXMD<sub>J </sub>diaphragm. The greater cross-sectional area of slow fibers in affected diaphragms might be due to hypertrophy in compensation for loss of fast fibers, relating to plasticity of muscle fibers, as mentioned above. The diaphragm keeps continuous contraction of muscle fibers without resting, while limb skeletal muscle regularly rests its movement. Therefore, replacement with slow fibers may be particularly enhanced in the diaphragm rather than TC muscle, depending on pathological severity and contractile activity of skeletal muscles. </p><p>Fiber type determination and fiber type-specific gene expression are regulated by multiple signaling pathways and transcription factors. As partially described above, a key mediator, calcineurin, plays an important role in acquisition of fiber phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] and may induce not only transition of MHC isoforms from faster to slower types but also transformation of myofiber phenotypes in mouse or rat muscles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. In addition, calcineurin signaling activity was greater in the diaphragm than in the tibialis anterior muscle of the <italic>mdx </italic>mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Therefore, replacement with slow fibers may be up-regulated to a greater extent in the diaphragm than in the TC muscle of CXMD<sub>J</sub>.</p><p>We also showed age-related changes of MHC expression in affected diaphragms after 6 months old, in contrast to TC muscles (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). In addition, fiber type compositions in non-regenerating or regenerating fibers were also different between the TC muscle and the diaphragm, depending on age. In non-regenerating fibers of affected TC muscles, fast MHC fibers at 4 months old was higher than those at 2 and 11 months old (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). It might be partially involved in pathological changes that degenerative lesions appeared obviously in affected TC muscles after 4 months old, as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. In regenerating fibers of the CXMD<sub>J </sub>diaphragm, the proportion of myofibers expressing slow type MHC increased markedly after 4 months old (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>). These results suggested that MHC expression in TC muscle and the diaphragm of CXMD<sub>J </sub>would be influenced by different mechanisms after 4 months old. These age-dependent MHC expression might be related to body growth, particularly increasing of muscle mass. One possibility is participitation of insulin-like growth factor (IGF)-1, which is important for postnatal growth of skeletal muscles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] and can activate multiple Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent signaling pathways, including the calcineurin/NFAT pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. When growth rate of body weight decreases after 4 months old [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], signaling activity of IGF-1 might reduce and MHC expression might be regulated predominantly by alternative signaling pathways.</p></sec><sec><title>Comparison among <italic>mdx</italic>, CXMD<sub>J</sub>, and DMD diaphragms</title><p>MHC expression in normal skeletal muscle has been well studied in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], dogs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], and humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. In normal dogs, the proportions of fiber types in TC muscle were relatively similar to those in the representative tibialis anterior muscles of mice and humans. In the diaphragm, however, the proportion of fiber types differed markedly among these species. The murine diaphragm is composed mainly of fast type IIA and IIX isoforms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], but the canine diaphragm consists of equal populations of slow type MHC I and fast type MHC IIA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], as also shown in our study. In normal human diaphragm, the distribution of myosin isoforms has been estimated that types I, IIA, and IIX account for approximately 45%, 40%, and 15%, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Thus, the proportions of MHC isoforms in the diaphragm of healthy dogs are much closer to those of humans than those of mice.</p><p>Some groups have studied expression profiles of MHC isoforms in the diaphragm of the <italic>mdx </italic>mouse. The <italic>mdx </italic>diaphragm shows increases in MHC type I fibers and elimination of type IIX population at 2 years old, but not at young ages (3 to 6 months old) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. In contrast to the <italic>mdx </italic>diaphragm, that in CXMD<sub>J </sub>exhibited drastic changes even in younger animals (6 months old). On the other hand, there is no direct information available regarding the changes in fiber type composition in the diaphragm in human DMD. In addition, there is an important difference of MHC expression even in limb skeletal muscles between large mammals (including dogs and humans) and mammals with smaller body mass, especially rodents. The former do not express the fastest MHC IIB isoform in limb muscles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], while it is abundantly expressed in the latter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Therefore, changes/adaptations in skeletal muscles of dogs with muscular dystrophy are likely to be more relevant to human DMD, than that in the <italic>mdx </italic>mouse. As it is difficult to examine the diaphragms of DMD patients, it would be important to investigate the differences between murine and canine models for understanding the mechanisms of respiratory failure in human DMD.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Based on fiber type classification using MHC expression, we demonstrated the predominant replacement with slow fibers and reduced muscle regeneration with progression of muscular dystrophy in the diaphragm of a canine DMD model, but these phenomena were much less strict in affected TC muscle. In addition, the expression profiles of MHC isoforms in the CXMD<sub>J </sub>diaphragm were evidently different from those of the <italic>mdx </italic>mouse. Our results indicated that dystrophic dog is a more appropriate model than a murine one for human DMD, and would be useful for investigation of the mechanisms of respiratory failure in DMD, as well as pathological and molecular biological backgrounds, and therapeutic effects in clinical trials.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>KY designed the study, carried out the pathological and immunohistological examinations, and drafted the manuscript.
