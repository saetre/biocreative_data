Importantly, platelet function varies considerably among individuals and subjects with enhanced platelet reactivity have increased atherothrombotic risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The adenosine diphosphate (ADP) P2Y<sub>12 </sub>receptor plays a central role in platelet activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The relevance of this receptor is demonstrated by the clinical benefit obtained in patients when it is blocked by the P2Y<sub>12 </sub>receptor antagonist clopidogrel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Recently, Fontana et al. identified two functional haplotypes designated as H1 and H2, tagged by 4 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in absolute linkage disequilibrium (i-C139T, i-T744C, i-ins801A, G52T). Importantly, the minor haplotype (H2) was found to be associated with enhanced platelet reactivity suggesting a role for gene sequence variations of the P2Y<sub>12 </sub>receptor in atherothrombotic processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Notably, the H2 haplotype has also shown to be associated with peripheral arterial disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. However, its association with coronary atherosclerotic disease has still been poorly explored. To investigate whether this H2 haplotype of the P2Y<sub>12 </sub>receptor gene may be associated with coronary artery disease, we studied the distribution of the i-T744C SNP in 1378 unrelated patients, selected according to the presence of significant coronary artery disease (N = 991) or of normal coronary angiogram at cardiac catheterization (N = 387).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study population</title><p>A total of 1945 consecutive subjects undergoing cardiac catheterization at the University Hospital of Verona were recruited from 1996 to 2005.

Significant coronary artery disease was angiographically determined after the first manifestation of symptoms of ischemic heart disease and was defined as a greater than 50% visually estimated luminal diameter stenosis in at least one major epicardial coronary artery. Most of CAD patients were candidate to coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). Since the primary aim of our selection was to provide an objective and clear-cut definition of the atherosclerotic phenotype, subjects with non significant coronary stenosis (&#x0003c; 50%) were not included in the study. Most of the patients have not been treated with antiplatelet drugs before the recruitment. After CABG, 90% of patients have been treated with aspirin, about 9% with ticlopidina and 1% with indobuphen. No patients had therapy with clopidogrel. Controls (CAD-free group), mainly examined for valvular heart disease, were enrolled providing that they had not only a normal coronary angiogram at cardiac catheterization, but also neither history nor clinical or instrumental evidence of atherosclerosis in vascular districts other than the coronary bed. The angiograms were assessed by two cardiologists unaware that the patients were to be included in the study.</p><p>All individuals gave a written consent before entering the study, which was approved by the Ethical Committee of the University Hospital of Verona.</p></sec><sec><title>Genotyping</title><p>Individuals were genotyped for the i-T744C SNP (NCBI refSEQ: rs2046934) of the P2Y<sub>12 </sub>receptor gene (<italic>P2RY12</italic>) in order to tag the H1(744T) and H2 (744C) haplotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].

Thus the finding of the present study further extends our knowledge on the implications of gene sequence variations of this receptor, a key player in platelet function, on atherothrombosis. In fact, to date this polymorphism has shown to be associated with peripheral arterial disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], while its association with coronary artery disease has been poorly explored.</p><p>One prior report has assessed the association between this haplotype and long term complications of coronary artery disease (cardiac death, myocardial infarction and refractory angina requiring revascularization) but failed to find any association [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].

Therefore, despite the key role of P2RY12 receptor on inducing platelet activation, it is likely that genetic polymorphisms of other targets may be more important in modulating aspirin and clopidogrel effects[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Moreover, Hetherington et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] reported no significant effect of P2RY12 SNPs, including the i-T744C one, on platelet response to ADP in subjects without history of CAD, and an association of a common variant in P2Y1 gene with platelet reactivity.</p><p>Atherosclerosis is a multifactorial disease and involves both environmental and genetic factors. Therefore, the low penetrance of a single functional polymorphism may not always lead to a clinical phenotype as this may be obscured by environmental factors. This may explain why the H2 haplotype of <italic>P2RY12 </italic>gene had its strongest association with CAD in non-smoking individuals. Notably, platelets isolated from smokers exhibit increased reactivity as well as spontaneous aggregation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Moreover, nicotine upregulates the expression of P2Y<sub>12 </sub>receptors on vascular cells and megakaryoblasts, and smokers exhibit higher P2Y<sub>12 </sub>expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Therefore, the presence of genetic determinants leading to increased platelet function profiles may be masked by cigarette smoking. Notably, the association between the H2 haplotype and CAD in non-smokers remained significant even after adjustment for other covariates (age, sex, BMI, triglycerides, HDL, LDL, hypertension, smoking and diabetes) by multivariate logistic regression, suggesting that the P2RY12 gene is an independent risk factor for coronary artery disease in these subjects.</p><p>The complex interplay between genetic and environmental factors on the development of atherosclerotic disease explains why large study populations are required to define if a particular functional polymorphism may have effects not only on intermediate phenotypes (i.e. platelet activation), but also on clinical phenotypes (e.g. atherosclerosis). In the present study, as expected, conventional cardiovascular risk factors were more common in patients with CAD. However, it was also demonstrated that the H2 haplotype was more frequently present in patients with CAD. This observation is in keeping with the concept that in multifactorial diseases, genetic polymorphisms influence the risk of disease by determining a different individual susceptibility to environmental risk factors rather than being the cause of the disease process itself.</p><p>The primary end-point of the present work was to investigate the association between CAD and the i-T744C SNP of the P2RY12 gene through a case-control study in unrelated individuals. Certainly the study has some limitations, such as the relatively low number of controls and no available data on platelet aggregation. On the other hand, the sample size of our study-population was adequate to detect a mild effect on phenotype by this genetic variant. A strength of this work was the clear-cut definition of CAD phenotype on the basis of coronary angiography, which is of pivotal importance in the analysis of genotype-phenotype correlation. Male and female subgroups showed H2 haplotype carriers more frequently in CAD patients, and it is likely that these observation did not reach the statistical significance due to the small size of each group after stratification.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study supports the previously reported association of <italic>P2RY12 </italic>gene with atherosclerosis, giving for the first time genetic association data for the presence of significant coronary artery disease, particularly in non-smoking individuals. Nonetheless, this correlation remains still controversial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] and further studies, possibly with prospective design, are needed to confirm these data.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>Dominick J.
