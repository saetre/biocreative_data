An open reading frame of 681 base pairs was found in this region which encodes a protein of 227 amino acid residues (calculated molecular weight = 25,218). When this open reading frame was cloned into a high expression vector, pIN-III, a protein of apparent molecular weight of 26,000 was produced upon induction of the cloned gene. This product accounted for up to 5% of the total cellular protein, and comigrated with purified RNase III. RNase III enzyme activity was induced in parallel with the production of the 26,000 molecular weight protein. A putative promoter was found 170 base pairs upstream from the initiation codon. In the long leader region a very stable stem-bulge-stem structure was found which closely resembles typical RNase III cleavage sites. This structure may be cleaved by RNase III to auto-regulate the expression of the rnc gene.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00307-0079-a" xlink:role="4682"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00307-0074.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4677"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00307-0075.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4678"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00307-0076.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4679"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00307-0077.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4680"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00307-0078.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4681"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00307-0079.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4682"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00307-0080.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4683"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00307-0081.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4684"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00307-0082.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4685"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
