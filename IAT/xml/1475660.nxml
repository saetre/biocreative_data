Chemokines and their receptors control the trafficking of immune cells to sites of infection. In this study, the authors examined the immune response to <named-content content-type="genus-species">T. gondii</named-content> in mice deficient in the chemokine receptor CCR5. CCR5-deficient mice exhibited a decreased inflammatory response, which led to a higher parasite burden and ultimate mortality. The deficiency in the immune response in CCR5-deficient mice was the result of decreased migration of natural killer (NK) cells into infected tissues.

NK cells are generated in the bone marrow, and after leaving this compartment are found in peripheral blood, spleen, and liver. They can, however, be induced to localize in tissues in response to infectious and inflammatory stimuli. The molecular mechanisms controlling NK cell trafficking are just beginning to be identified. Like other leukocytes, chemokines are thought to play an important role in NK cell trafficking. NK cells have been reported to express multiple chemokine receptors, including CXCR1&#x02013;CXCR4, CCR4, CCR5, CCR7, CCR8 and CX<sub>3</sub>CR1; however, their individual roles in NK cell homing in vivo have not been delineated &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020049-b011">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020049-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d;.

These NK cells are an important source of the IFN&#x003b3; needed for the induction of chemokines, such as CXCL10/IP-10 and CXCL9/MIG, that control the trafficking of activated T cells into infected tissues &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020049-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;. Thus, chemokines are an important link between the innate and adaptive immune response operating at the level of NK cell recruitment into tissues and subsequent conversion of the NK cell response into a T cell response through the activity of IFN&#x003b3;-inducible chemokines.</p><p>The chemokines and chemokine receptors responsible for NK cell trafficking in response to <named-content content-type="genus-species">T. gondii</named-content> infection have not been studied.

We detected a similar increase in CCL3 and CCL4 mRNA levels in the spleen, lung, and liver on day 5 PI in both wild-type and CCR5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. CCL5 was similarly increased in lung and liver on day 5 in both wild-type and CCR5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. Interestingly, levels of CCL3 continued to rise on day 7 in spleen and liver of wild-type, but not of CCR5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, leading to differences in the levels of CCL3 on day 7 in the spleen and liver, at which time we found differences in NK cell numbers in those tissues. CCL5 also had a similar increase in infected wild-type and CCR5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice in the lung and liver on day 5. However, by day 7 the levels in CCR5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice decreased, while the levels in the wild-type did not. Thus, we found that an early burst of CCR5 ligand production occurred in both wild-type and CCR5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice following infection that likely accounted for the recruitment of CCR5<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> NK cells into these tissues by day 7. However, without this influx of NK cells in the CCR5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, the expression of these ligands decreased by day 7, suggesting that a positive feedback loop exists between NK cells and the production of CCR5 ligands that lead to NK cell recruitment. It is also worth noting that we detected very low levels of CCL3 and CCL4 in the small intestine, which might explain our inability to detect NK cell recruitment into this tissue following <named-content content-type="genus-species">T. gondii</named-content> infection. CCL3 and CCL4 are induced in many cell types in response to proinflammatory stimuli, such as lipopolysaccharide and tumor necrosis factor &#x003b1;.

CCL5 is also induced by multiple inflammatory stimuli and is also constitutively expressed in T cells. Thus, decreased CCL5 levels in CCR5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice on day 7 likely also reflects a decreased inflammatory response in the CCR5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice.</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Diminished IFN&#x003b3; and IFN&#x003b3;-Inducible CXCR3 Chemokine Ligands in CCR5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> Mice at Day 7 PI</title><p>As NK cells are an important source of IFN&#x003b3; during early <named-content content-type="genus-species">T. gondii</named-content> infection &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020049-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;, we analyzed the mRNA expression of IFN&#x003b3;, and the IFN&#x003b3;-inducible CXCR3 chemokine ligands IP-10/CXCL10, MIG/CXCL9 and I-TAC/CXCL11 in wild-type and CCR5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice.

As others and we have described previously, IFN&#x003b3;, CXCL10, and CXCL9 were significantly induced in all organs tested following infection.

However, as was seen above for the CCR5 ligands, by day 7 the levels of IFN&#x003b3; and IFN&#x003b3;-inducible chemokines markedly diminished in organs harvested from infected CCR5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice.

To investigate this possibility, serum IL-12 levels in CCR5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and wild-type mice in both the C57BL/6 and C57BL/6x129 backgrounds were measured before infection and at days 3, 5, and 9 post-oral infection with <named-content content-type="genus-species">T. gondii</named-content> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020049-g007">Figure 7</xref>). We found a similar IL-12 serum response in CCR5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and wild-type mice in the C57BL/6 background. Baseline levels were the same in wild-type and CCR5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, and following infection serum IL-12 levels peaked on day 5 at 15&#x02013;20 ng/ml in both wild-type and CCR5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> in the C57BL/6 background. Thus, in this genetic background the diminished NK cell response could not be accounted for by a blunted IL-12 response. However, as reported &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020049-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;, CCR5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice in the C57BL/6x129 background had an approximately 50&#x00025; reduction in the serum IL-12 response following <named-content content-type="genus-species">T. gondii</named-content> infection, with levels on day 9 PI of 12 ng/ml (&#x000b1; 3.2 ng/ml) in wild-type mice and 7.6 ng/ml (&#x000b1; 1.7 ng/ml) in CCR5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020049-g007">Figure 7</xref>B).

In these mice, however, IL-12 increased the number of NK cells in the blood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020049-g008">Figure 8</xref>E), demonstrating that CCR5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice responded to IL-12 therapy, but were unable to recruit these mobilized NK cells into tissue. These data establish that the impaired immune response to <named-content content-type="genus-species">T. gondii</named-content> seen in CCR5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice is not solely the result of an impaired ability to generate IL-12, but is also the result of an inability to effectively mobilize NK cells into infected tissue.</p></sec><sec id="s2j"><title>NK Cell Depletion Recapitulates the CCR5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> Phenotype</title><p>Our data suggest that CCR5 expression on NK cells is critical for NK cell trafficking into tissue in response to <named-content content-type="genus-species">T. gondii</named-content> infection, and that this impairment in NK cell trafficking into tissue explains the phenotype observed in CCR5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. If this is the main reason for the observed phenotype, then it follows that NK cell depletion of wild-type mice should reveal a similar phenotype following <named-content content-type="genus-species">T. gondii</named-content> infection. We therefore depleted NK cells in wild-type C57BL/6 mice using anti-asialo GM1 antibody treatment to determine whether depletion of NK cell results in a reduced inflammatory response similar to CCR5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice in this genetic background. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020049-g009">Figure 9</xref>A, while C57BL/6 wild-type mice treated with control antibody died by day 9 PI, the majority of NK cell-depleted mice survived until day 21 PI. To demonstrate that the protective effect of NK cell depletion on early mortality was the result of an attenuated tissue hyperinflammatory response, tissues were analyzed histopathologically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020049-g009">Figure 9</xref>B). As expected, mice treated with control antibody exhibited extensive necrosis of the ileum of small bowel, with acute inflammation, including polymorphonuclear cells in the lamina propria. The liver showed marked confluent fatty degeneration of hepatocytes, with small inflammatory nodules in the parenchyma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020049-g009">Figure 9</xref>B). In contrast, the small intestines of anti-asialo GM1-treated mice revealed no necrosis, with preservation of epithelial cells within the villi. Livers of these NK cell-depleted mice showed an acute inflammatory infiltrate, which was compatible with acute infection seen in <named-content content-type="genus-species">T. gondii</named-content>-infected mice that do not have a hyperimmune inflammatory response. To establish that mortality at the later time points in the NK cell-depleted mice was due to infection and not a tissue hyperimmune response, tissues (spleen, brain, and liver) from NK cell-depleted mice were analyzed for parasite burden. On day 7 PI, when control antibody-treated C57BL/6 mice were beginning to succumb to their infection but NK cell-depleted mice were not, parasite load was low in both groups. However, by day 18 PI, when NK cell-depleted mice were beginning to succumb to their infection, tissue parasite load in these mice had increased several hundred-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020049-g009">Figure 9</xref>C). All control antibody-treated infected mice died by day 10 PI and were therefore not available for analysis on day 18 PI. As a further control, we found that anti-asialo GM1 antibody treatment of uninfected mice had no effect on mortality (unpublished data). To determine whether the increased mortality and tissue hyperimmune response in C57BL/6 mice was the result of CCR5-mediated NK cell trafficking, we adoptively transferred wild-type and CCR5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> NK cells into CCR5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice followed by <named-content content-type="genus-species">T. gondii</named-content> challenge.

In orally infected animals we found markedly reduced numbers of CCR5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> NK cells in spleen and liver, tissues in which we observed an early induction of CCR5 ligand expression.

Interestingly, we found no significant expression of CCR5 ligands in this tissue following infection until day 7; even then it was much less than that observed in the spleen, lung, and liver. We also found that CCR5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> NK cells accumulated in the blood and mesenteric lymph node of infected animals.

Absence of an optimal NK cell response at the site of infection in the CCR5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice lead to a defective clearance of parasites, resulting in increased mortality. Although less critical than T cells, which are needed for long-term host survival &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020049-b029">29</xref>&#x0005d;, NK cells play an essential role in host survival following challenge with a high parasite load. In the present study, we observed that CCR5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice on the C57BL/6x129 background, when challenged orally with 20 cysts, could survive the infection. However, when the dose was increased to 50 cysts, optimal NK cell migration to infected sites was needed, without which the host was unable to survive. Furthermore, transfer of splenocytes as well as purified NK cells from uninfected wild-type mice protected CCR5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice against this high challenge, while the transfer of NK cell-depleted splenocytes did not confer protection in these mice.

Our study does not directly address this issue, but we found that CCR5 must also act downstream of IL-12. We observed that CCR5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice in the C57BL/6 background had an equivalent increase in serum IL-12 levels following <named-content content-type="genus-species">T. gondii</named-content> infection. Thus, the phenotype that we observed in CCR5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice in this background&#x02014;a blunted hyperimmune response and a decrease in NK cell recruitment into tissues&#x02014;could not be explained by a blunted IL-12 response. We did, however, confirm the findings of Aliberti et al. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020049-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;, who reported an approximately 50&#x00025; decrease in serum IL-12 levels in CCR5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> C57BL/6x129 mice following <named-content content-type="genus-species">T. gondii</named-content> infection. Thus CCR5-dependent IL-12 production may play a role in controlling parasite replication in CCR5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice in C57BL/6x129 background. However, we do not believe that this partial reduction in serum IL-12 fully accounts for the dramatic phenotype we observed for CCR5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice in this background. We could not restore resistance of CCR5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice to <named-content content-type="genus-species">T. gondii</named-content> infection with exogenous IL-12 treatment. Furthermore, exogenous IL-12 did not reverse the defect in NK cell trafficking we observed in CCR5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, even though IL-12 augmented NK numbers recovered from the spleen of uninfected and infected wild-type mice. Furthermore, exogenous IL-12 increased the resistance of wild-type mice to a lethal <named-content content-type="genus-species">T. gondii</named-content> challenge. Thus, taken together, these data support an additional and major role for CCR5 downstream of IL-12 production in the recruitment of NK cells into <named-content content-type="genus-species">T. gondii</named-content>-infected tissue.</p><p>The chemokine system is a complex cytokine network that controls the trafficking of leukocytes.

First, although in vitro studies have implied the existence of redundancy in the chemokine system, as evidenced by the fact that NK cells express multiple chemokine receptors and respond to multiple chemokines, studies such as ours have revealed that individual chemokines and chemokine receptors play important, nonredundant roles in vivo. Second, our study dramatically underscores the importance of genetic background when examining the effects of a chemokine or chemokine receptor gene in a complex biological process, such as host defense against pathogens. In the pure C57BL/6 background, the absence of CCR5 was protective, because it led to a diminished hyperimmune response, which in the C57BL/6 background can be lethal. However, in the mixed C57BL/6x129 background, which is not susceptible to the hyperimmune response, and can otherwise withstand high doses of infection, this diminished inflammatory response led to increased mortality from uncontrolled parasite growth. Thus, the absence of CCR5 and the resultant impaired recruitment of IFN&#x003b3;-secreting NK cells has a different outcome on the host response to <named-content content-type="genus-species">T. gondii</named-content> depending on the genetic background.</p><p>Based on our current data and prior studies &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020049-b015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020049-b016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020049-b047">47</xref>&#x0005d;, a picture is emerging regarding the critical role of chemokines in linking the innate and acquired immune response to pathogens such as <named-content content-type="genus-species">T. gondii</named-content>. <named-content content-type="genus-species">T. gondii</named-content> infection induces an early and rapid burst in CCL3 and CCL4 production in specific infected tissue, such as the spleen, liver, and lung. CCL3 and CCL4 recruit IFN&#x003b3;-secreting NK cells into infected tissue in a CCR5-dependent manner. IFN&#x003b3; induces the production of chemokines, including CXCL10, from resident tissue cells that attract antigen-specific CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> lymphocytes into infected tissue to establish organ-specific immunity &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020049-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;.

For isolating peripheral blood lymphocytes, blood was collected by cardiac puncture in a microcentrifuge tube containing heparin. About 500&#x02013;700 &#x003bc;l of blood was obtained by this method and lysis of red blood cells was performed using Red Cell Lysis Buffer (Sigma). The cell pellet was resuspended in PBS containing 1&#x00025; BSA. Splenocytes, mesenteric lymph node cells, and hepatic lymphocytes were suspended in PBS containing 10&#x00025; FCS, and all the samples were counted in a hemocytometer prior to staining with the fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies anti-CD3-FITC, anti-CD8-FITC, anti-NK1.1-PE, and anti-CD45.2-FITC (clone 104) (all from BD PharMingen, San Diego, California, United States) and anti-CD4-Red613 (GIBCO BRL, Grand Island, New York, United States). Two- and three-color flow cytometry was performed on a FACscan cytometer (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, California, United States) and the data were analyzed using Lysys software (Hewlett-Packard, Palo Alto, California, United States). The absolute number of positive cells was calculated as follows: Total number of cells recovered from organ &#x000d7; percentage of cells staining positive/100.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Proliferation assay.</title><p>CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells were purified from splenocytes by positive selection using microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany).
