In the mouse, NCAM proteins with apparent Mr's of 180,000, 140,000 and 120,000 have been distinguished. These are encoded by 4 to 5 different transcripts. Here we report the full amino acid sequence of an isoform which most likely represents NCAM-140. The N-terminal extracellular portion of the 829-residue polypeptide appears to be identical to all three NCAM proteins. The Mr of 91,276 is considerably smaller than the estimate based on SDS-gel electrophoresis. The 147 C-terminal residues are distinct from NCAM-120 and contain the putative transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. The transcript encoding NCAM-140 contains almost 3.2 kb non-coding sequence with a canonical polyadenylation signal. While the 5' sequences of NCAM-140 hybridize with all NCAM mRNAs, the 3' probes recognize only the two larger transcripts of 7.4 and 6.7 kb. From S1 nuclease protection analyses and hybridization studies of several NCAM cDNA clones with genomic NCAM sequences one can conclude that the different NCAM transcripts are generated by alternative splicing. In addition to the two alternative splice sites in the sequence encoding the extracellular domains, a third one can be predicted approximately 320 nt downstream of the start of the NCAM-140-specific sequence portion. This finding is in agreement with the existence of an extra exon in the chicken NCAM-180. Comparison between mouse and chicken NCAM amino acid sequences revealed the highest homology in the second and fifth Ig-like domains and in the cytoplasmic parts suggesting that these regions serve highly conserved functions.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00265-0067-a" xlink:role="8632"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00265-0069-a" xlink:role="8634"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00265-0056.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8621"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00265-0057.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8622"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00265-0058.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8623"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00265-0059.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8624"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00265-0060.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8625"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00265-0061.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8626"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00265-0062.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8627"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00265-0063.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8628"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00265-0064.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8629"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00265-0065.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8630"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00265-0066.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8631"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00265-0067.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8632"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00265-0068.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8633"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00265-0069.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8634"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00265-0070.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8635"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00265-0071.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8636"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00265-0072.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8637"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00265-0073.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8638"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00265-0074.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8639"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00265-0075.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8640"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00265-0076.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="8641"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
