The function of the 40 kDa DLM-1 protein is poorly understood. DLM-1 contains an N-terminal Z-DNA binding domain homologous to the Z&#x003b1; domain in the RNA editing enzyme ADAR1. We report the cloning of human and rat <italic>DLM-1</italic>. In addition to the Z&#x003b1; domain, three further conserved regions were identified. One of these is homologous to the second Z-DNA binding domain, Z&#x003b2;, of ADAR1. We find that human <italic>DLM-1</italic> is predominantly expressed in lymphatic tissues. The gene spans 17 kb and consists of 10 exons. DNA transcripts are extremely heterogeneous as a result of alternative splicing and the usage of exon variants combined with at least two transcriptional start sites and 3&#x02032;-terminal exons. The exon coding for the Z&#x003b1; domain was present in approximately one-third of the analyzed mRNAs. Nearly half of the transcripts contained exon variants that had premature stop codons incorporated. Based on our analysis, over 2000 different mRNAs may be produced due to alternative splicing and usage of different 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; ends. The cellular function of DLM-1 appears to call for a high degree of adaptation by this complex regulation.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes id="N0x8a7d9e0.0x93f0b18" notes-type="data_link"><p>DDBJ&#x0002f;EMBL&#x0002f;GenBank accession no.

Under physiological conditions, Z-DNA formation is a dynamic process, largely controlled by the amount of supercoiling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf182c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf182c3">3</xref>). A tight correlation between Z-DNA formation and transcriptional activity has been observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf182c4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf182c6">6</xref>). Biological roles for left-handed Z-DNA have not yet been established. Several functions for Z-DNA formation have been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf182c7">7</xref>). It has been shown that sequences which contain potential Z-DNA forming sequences have the potential to modulate promoter activity in reporter gene assays (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf182c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf182c9">9</xref>). The Z-DNA forming sequences may either enhance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf182c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf182c11">11</xref>) or repress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf182c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf182c13">13</xref>) promoter activity.</p><p>In an attempt to identify proteins with a high affinity for Z-DNA, the RNA editing enzyme ADAR1 has been found to contain two Z-DNA binding domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf182c14">14</xref>). Crystallization of the Z-DNA binding domain Z&#x003b1; revealed that it belongs to the family of winged-helix proteins and that it recognizes Z-DNA in a structure-specific manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf182c15">15</xref>). A function of this domain may be to direct ADAR1 to a location where RNA editing is supposed to take place. Since Z-DNA formation is favored by negative supercoiling as generated behind moving RNA polymerases, ADAR1 would be directed to loci where transcription takes place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf182c7">7</xref>). It has been further demonstrated that Z&#x003b1; can also bind left-handed, double-stranded RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf182c16">16</xref>).</p><p>It was recently shown that the murine protein DLM-1 contains a region homologous to Z&#x003b1;<sub>ADAR</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf182c17">17</xref>). Co-crystallization of the Z&#x003b1; domain of mDLM-1 with Z-DNA revealed that Z&#x003b1; of DLM-1 binds left-handed Z-DNA in a structure-specific manner, similarly to the Z&#x003b1; domain of ADAR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf182c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf182c17">17</xref>). Both domains adopt a winged-helix conformation. Murine DLM-1 was identified because it was upregulated in tumor stromal cells. It is induced upon activation in macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf182c18">18</xref>). It has been proposed that DLM-1 plays an important role in the host response to tumor formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf182c18">18</xref>). Besides the Z-DNA binding domain, no further significant similarities have been found that may explain the function of DLM-1, especially in the context of nucleic acid binding.</p><p>In order to characterize conserved regions in DLM-1, we cloned the human and rat homologs and analyzed the tissue expression pattern as well as the gene structure of human <italic>DLM-1</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) PCR</title><p>RACE PCRs were performed with human spleen Marathon-Ready cDNA (Clontech).

Homologous regions were identified on chromosome 20q13.31. Primers specific for human <italic>DLM-1</italic> were derived from predicted exonic regions and RT&#x02013;PCRs were performed. The genomic organization of the 10 identified exons of human DLM-1 is shown (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf182f1">1</xref>). It spans over 17 kb.</p></sec><sec><title>Expression pattern of DLM-1</title><p>RT&#x02013;PCRs with primers derived from exon 1 and exon 8 were performed from human cDNAs from various human tissues. Expression of <italic>hDLM-1</italic> is tissue specific. It was most prominently expressed in lymph node and splenic cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf182f2">2</xref>A). Significant amounts were also detected in peripheral leukocytes, tonsil, bone marrow and small intestine. Low levels were seen in thymus, lung, liver and pancreas. Alternative splicing led to the detection of reaction products of multiple sizes. Control RT&#x02013;PCR with cyclophilin-specific primers demonstrated that comparable amounts of cDNA were present in all cDNA preparations (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf182f2">2</xref>B). <italic>DLM-1</italic> amplification products were cloned and sequenced. The exon composition of individually analyzed cDNA isoforms is shown schematically in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf182f3">3</xref>. The most prominent band seen in the PCR analysis evidently represents transcripts comprising exons 1A, 3A, 4A, 5A, 6A and 8 (844 bp; marked by an asterisk in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf182f3">3</xref>), which was cloned in 10 out of 32 cases. The second most abundant band includes exons 1A, 2A, 3A, 4A, 5A, 6A and 8 (1069 bp; marked by two asterisks in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf182f3">3</xref>), which was cloned in four cases. Sequences derived from reactions with forward primer DLM1f in combination with a reverse primer from one of the two different 3&#x02032;-terminal exons are shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf182f3">3</xref>C and D. In 56&#x00025; (18 out of 32) of all analyzed clones the open reading frame (ORF) was continuous, whereas it was interrupted in the remainder. In 9 out of 14 cases the interruption was due to premature stop codons that originated from exon 6 variants. All nine exon 6 variants share a stretch of 39 bp, which encode the complete variant I of exon 6. In three cases the ORF was interrupted by a premature stop codon in the exon 1 variant B, and in two cases by a stop in exon 4, variant B. Exon 2, coding for the Z-DNA binding domain Z&#x003b1;<sub>DLM</sub>, was subject to alternative splicing and was included in 28&#x00025; of analyzed clones. A shortened form of exon 2, exon 2B, was identified in one clone, where the last 36 nt in the 3&#x02032; region of this exon were spliced out. For the relative locations of exons and the frequency of their occurrence see Supplementary Material Table S1.</p></sec><sec><title>Analyses of 5&#x02032;- and 3&#x02032;-terminal exons</title><p>3&#x02032;-RACE PCRs were performed with gene-specific primers indicated in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf182f3">3</xref>E and F. Three major amplification products were detected (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf182f2">2</xref>C, lanes 2 and 3). Cloning and sequencing of these revealed that the different products, which were all polyadenylated, resulted from different 3&#x02032;-terminal exons. In the largest and most prominent product, variants of exon 10 were present, whereas the others contained exon 9. Two variants of exon 9 with different polyadenylation sites were found. The sequences of 3&#x02032;-RACE PCR products and the genomic sequences, as well as the deduced C-terminal amino acid sequences are shown (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf182f4">4</xref>). Three consensus polyadenylation signals precede the polyadenylation sites in exon 10. In exon 9 the two polyA tails are preceded by atypical polyadenylation signals. The complete exon 9 is part of a 2.5 kb Tigger repetitive element (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf182f1">1</xref>), which belongs to the family of DNA transposons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf182c19">19</xref>). Sequence similarity compared with the Tigger1 consensus sequence is 86&#x00025;. The Tigger element integrated in the opposite direction relative to the orientation of DLM-1. The deduced 82 C-terminal amino acids of DLM-1 ending with exon 9 are encoded by the antisense strand of the ORF1 of the Tigger1 element.</p><p>Sixty-four percent of clones obtained from 5&#x02032;-RACE PCR (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf182f2">2</xref>C, lane 1) started with exon 1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf182f5">5</xref>). Four different 5&#x02032; ends were identified (see Supplementary Material, Fig. S1). In 50&#x00025; (three out of six) of these clones exon 2 was included. Four clones started 5&#x02032; to exon 3. Two of them started 397 bp and two 231 bp 5&#x02032; to exon 3. The potential start codon of transcripts beginning with exon 3 lies in exon 4.</p></sec><sec><title>Identification of a third polyadenylation site by the analysis of expressed sequence tags (ESTs)</title><p>The dbEST data base was searched with different fragments of the <italic>DLM-1</italic> gene for human ESTs. Eight ESTs were identified that showed sequence identities ranging between 99 and 100&#x00025; compared with <italic>hDLM-1</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf182f1">1</xref>B). One clone (AW401499; origin: squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus) contained the terminal part of exon 10. Another (N23727; origin: olfactory epithelium) contained part of exon 8 spliced to exon 9. Clone AW401499 (origin: lymph node germinal B-cells) contained part of exon 4, the complete exons 5 and 6A as well as part of exon 8.</p><p>Five clones (AW449265, BF507915, BF511589, AI659939 and AI925506, derived from germ cells, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, uncharacterized tissue, colonic mucosa of patients with severe Crohn&#x02019;s disease, and adenocarinoma of the stomach, respectively) contained poly(A) tails originating in intron 5, 272 bp 3&#x02032; of the site where exon 5 was usually spliced to exon 6 variants. Inspection of the sequence of this region revealed the presence of a consensus polyadenylation signal AATAAA 19 bp 5&#x02032; of the polyadenylated sequences. Three of these clones contained a part of exon 4 spliced to exon 5, whereas two were not spliced to other exons.</p></sec><sec><title>Comparison between mouse, rat and human DLM-1</title><p>In order to determine conserved regions in DLM-1, we also cloned the rat DLM-1 gene. Primers used for RT&#x02013;PCR from rat spleen RNA were derived from the 5&#x02032;- and 3&#x02032;-untranslated regions of the mouse <italic>Dlm-1</italic> gene. These regions have a high degree of sequence homology with a rat EST (AI763632). The obtained sequence was used for primer construction for 3&#x02032;-RACE PCR. The deduced amino acid identity of rat and mouse DLM-1 is 74&#x00025;. Protein sequence identity of human to mouse and rat DLM-1 is 47 and 46&#x00025;, respectively. Four regions have been identified that show a higher degree of conservation between the three species (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf182f6">6</xref>, lines). The first two conserved domains (CDs) are homologous to the Z-DNA binding domains Z&#x003b1; and Z&#x003b2;, respectively, of the RNA editing enzyme ADAR1. In particular, those amino acids of Z&#x003b1; that contact DNA or form the hydrophobic protein core are highly conserved. No other homologies were identified for the other two conserved regions. The CDs fit well with the exon&#x0002f;intron structure of human DLM-1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf182f6">6</xref>). The first, Z&#x003b1; homologous, CD is encoded by exon 2, whereas the second, homologous to Z&#x003b2;, is encoded by exon 4. The third and fourth CDs are encoded by exons 5 and 8, respectively. Sequence identity of the region encoded by exon 6 is relatively low.</p></sec><sec><title>Identification of two DLM-1 alleles</title><p>Sequence analysis of the cloned PCR products revealed a single nucleotide polymorphism at the position of the third nucleotide of exon 3 (Supplementary Material, Fig. S1). This A440G substitution was present in 32&#x00025; of the analyzed clones, and would result in a deduced amino acid change from lysine to glutamic acid (K88E). Since the clones were obtained from the amplification of Marathon-Ready cDNA, which is pooled from a large number of human Caucasian individuals, it is likely that this distribution reflects the frequency of the polymorphism in the Caucasian population. This polymorphism affects a position in the predicted linker between the Z&#x003b1; and Z&#x003b2; domains of DLM-1.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>We describe here the cloning of the human and rat genes coding for the Z-DNA binding protein DLM-1, which is the homolog of murine DLM-1. Comparison between mouse, rat and human DLM-1 amino acid sequences revealed the existence of four domains with a high degree of conservation which show sequence identities of 67, 65, 71 and 61&#x00025;, respectively, between mouse and human sequences. The first two CDs correspond to the Z-DNA binding domains of ADAR1, Z&#x003b1; and Z&#x003b2;. No significant similarities to other proteins were identified for the C-terminal part of DLM-1. However, the existence of two CDs in this region indicates that these have been subjected to positive selective pressure and may play important roles.</p><p>Human DLM-1 is most strongly expressed in the small intestine as well as in lymphatic tissues, like lymph node, leukocytes and spleen. In lung and liver, DLM-1 was expressed to a lesser degree. This is partly in contrast to the expression pattern of mDlm-1, which was described to be expressed strongest in lung, liver and spleen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf182c18">18</xref>). In both species, no expression was observed in brain and skeletal muscle. Extensive alternative splicing of the 10 exons of human DLM-1 was found. In combination with different 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; termini, the splice variants we observed may lead to the production of over 2000 different mRNAs. However, on the basis of their putative encoded protein products these may be put into a small number of groups. In the majority of analyzed mRNAs (cDNA clones) the ORF was not interrupted through exon 8 (18 out of 32 clones). In the remainder this ORF was interrupted by premature stop codons. Four of these did not contain any significant ORF (&#x0003e;300 bp). The rest contained ORFs of variable lengths.</p><p>Approximately one-third of clones included exon 2, which encodes the Z-DNA binding domain Z&#x003b1;. In ADAR1, Z-DNA binding is exclusively dependent on the presence of the Z&#x003b1; domain. Z&#x003b2;, the second domain, enhances Z-DNA binding when tethered to Z&#x003b1;, but does not bind Z-DNA by itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf182c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf182c21">21</xref>). In analogy to ADAR1, we predict that messages lacking exon 2 do not bind Z-DNA efficiently. However, further studies of the tethered Z&#x003b1;&#x003b2;<sub>DLM</sub> domain and Z&#x003b2;<sub>DLM</sub> are necessary to prove this statement.</p><p>In most cases the ORF was interrupted as a result of alternatively spliced exon 6 variants. Of the nine variants of exon 6, seven (B, C, D, E, F, G and H) terminate the ORF when spliced to exon 5, which was found in all transcripts (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf182f3">3</xref>B&#x02013;D). mRNAs containing these exon variants are predicted to encode for truncated proteins with different C-termini. Five out of these seven variants (B, E, F, G and H) use a splice donor site that lies within the most frequent, the exon 6A variant. Only one mRNA was found that contained a variant with the same 5&#x02032; exonic sequence as exon 6A combined with the 3&#x02032; exonic sequence of exon 6B&#x02013;H (exon 6I). This exon 6 variant encodes 13 amino acids, and splicing to exon 8 leaves the ORF intact.</p><p>The existence of so many different exon 6 variants is remarkable. The alternative incorporation of exons containing premature stop codons into the hDLM-1 mRNA isoforms is a frequent phenomenon and appears to be of functional relevance. Proteins containing Z&#x003b1;<sub>DLM</sub>, but truncated by premature stop codons, would preserve the potential to bind Z-DNA. However, they would lack the C-terminal domains encoded by exons 6, 8 and 9 or 10. A similar situation applies also for transcripts terminating with exon 5. Although the function of the C-terminus is not known, it is conceivable that these proteins may function as naturally occurring dominant negative variants.</p><p>Alternatively, the mRNAs containing premature stop codons may be degraded by nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf182c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf182c23">23</xref>). The mRNA surveillance complex can scan for aberrant mRNAs. Inclusion of different exon variants containing premature translation termination codons occurs frequently and appears to be a regulated process. Degradation of these mRNAs by NMD may thus represent a post-transcriptional mechanism in the control of hDLM-1 expression.</p><p>Most of the identified 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; sequences flanking exons are in accord with the consensus sequences for RNA splice junctions obtained by Shapiro and Senapathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf182c24">24</xref>) (Supplementary Material, Table S1). Only two exceptions regarding the 5&#x02032;-splice site were identified. The first is an internal splice site in exon 2. This splicing event, which does not interrupt the ORF, was only found in one clone, and occurred 3&#x02032; to the Z&#x003b1; domain, in a region linking Z&#x003b1; with Z&#x003b2;. This linker is of variable length between rodent and human DLM-1 proteins as well as in ADAR1 of different species and its importance for Z-DNA binding is unclear. The splice donor site (AAG&#x0002f;gcgagg) is very similar to the atypical splice junctions found in the human genes for the acetylcholine receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf182c25">25</xref>) and superoxide dismutase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf182c26">26</xref>) where (AAG&#x0002f;gcaagg) is found. The second atypical splice donor site (CAG&#x0002f;aagtca) is found in exon 10 and leads to the splicing out of the region between variants B and C of this exon. This variant was only found in 3&#x02032;-RACE analysis from spleen cDNA, but not in RT&#x02013;PCR analyses where flanking primers were used for PCR amplification.</p><p>Three different 3&#x02032;-terminal exons were identified in the 3&#x02032;-RACE experiments and by the analysis of ESTs. The major product from 3&#x02032;-RACE experiments ended with polyadenylated exon 10. Three consensus polyadenylation signals are found 35&#x02013;10 bp 5&#x02032; of the polyadenylation site. The two minor bands correspond to products ending with exon 9, which were polyadenylated at different sites. Three atypical polyadenylation signals are present 5&#x02032; of the polyadenylation sites, which have been shown to mediate <italic>in vitro</italic> polyadenylation efficiencies of 18&#x00025; (CAUAAA), 10&#x00025; (AAUAUA) or 29&#x00025; (AGUAAA) as compared with the consensus signal (AAUAAA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf182c27">27</xref>).</p><p>The entire exon 9, including the polyadenylation sites, is part of a Tigger1 DNA transposable element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf182c19">19</xref>). The C-termini of mouse and rat DLM-1 show significant homology only to the amino acids encoded by human exon 10, but not to exon 9. The incorporation of a part of the Tigger1 element into the mRNA with coding capacity provides an example of how transposable elements may increase the genomic flexibility.</p><p>Two major transcriptional start sites were identified by 5&#x02032;-RACE analysis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf182f5">5</xref>). The mRNAs starting with exon 1 may include the Z-DNA binding domains encoded by exons 2 and 4. Transcripts beginning with exon 3 most likely use the first in-frame start codon, located in exon 4. It is of interest that this start site in exon 4 would not allow for a properly folded Z&#x003b2;<sub>DLM</sub> domain, since important parts of the hydrophobic core are encoded 5&#x02032; to this start site. Proteins encoded by these mRNAs would be identical to other DLM-1 isoforms in their C-terminal parts, but would be unable to bind Z-DNA.</p><p>Two major DLM-1 RNA isoforms were detected by northern blotting in the mouse. The 1.2 kb fragment was sensitive to cyclophosphamide, whereas the larger (2.2 kb) fragment was not. It has been speculated that the two RNA isoforms were most likely generated from alternative splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf182c18">18</xref>). However, they may also be a result of alternative transcriptional start or termination sites, analogous to the situation observed for <italic>hDLM-1</italic>. We have extensively searched various databases in order to identify regions with significant homologies to other sequences. The identified homologous regions were the Z&#x003b1; and Z&#x003b2; domains of the RNA editing enzyme ADAR1, as well as a domain related to Z&#x003b1;<sub>ADAR</sub>, in the vaccinia virus interferon resistance protein E3L. The Z&#x003b1; homologous domain from E3L can also bind to Z-DNA <italic>in vitro</italic> (T.Schwartz, unpublished data) and is conserved among orthopoxviridae. It has been shown to be essential for complete viral pathogenesis in a mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf182c28">28</xref>). Since the only two known eukaryotic proteins with Z-DNA binding domains, ADAR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf182c29">29</xref>) and DLM-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf182c18">18</xref>), are both &#x003b3; interferon-inducible, it seems possible that these proteins are important in the host-response to pathogens. Proteins of the E3L family could compete with ADAR1 and DLM-1 in nucleic acid binding and may thus prevent these proteins from being located properly.</p><p>The potential generation of multiple mRNAs from a single gene due to alternative splicing, the usage of different promoters or polyadenylation sites and RNA editing greatly increases the number of encoded protein isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf182c30">30</xref>). For instance, alternative splicing of RNA transcribed from the <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> gene encoding the axon guidance receptor Dscam can theoretically result in over 38 000 different mRNAs, by far exceeding the number of genes encoded by the entire <italic>D.melanogaster</italic> genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf182c31">31</xref>). The functional consequences of this alternative splicing are unknown.</p><p>The human genome is estimated to contain between 30 000 and 40 000 genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf182c32">32</xref>). However, genomic flexibiltity may be greatly increased by alternative splicing and usage of alternative transcription start and termination sites as shown here for <italic>hDLM-1</italic>. In addition to the identification of alternative transcripts, it will be a major challenge for the future to study the exact functional biochemical and physiological consequences of such alternative events.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL</title><p>Supplementary Material is available at NAR Online.</p><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="nar_30_4_993__index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="nar_30_4_993__1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkf182f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Organization of the human <italic>DLM-1</italic> gene.
