It is possible that the different potential fates for intracellular heme are dependent on the level of iron and/or heme exposure experienced by the bacterium in distinct host environments. If correct, this model suggests that bacterial pathogens monitor the level of intracellular heme and alter protein expression in response to changes in heme status.</p><p>Based on the demonstrated role for iron, Fur, and heme in staphylococcal pathogenesis, we sought to evaluate changes in global protein status in response to alterations in bacterial iron status using two-dimensional (2D) difference gel electrophoresis (DIGE). DIGE enables quantitative differential-display analysis with statistical confidence and is based on 2D gel separations whereby thousands of protein features can be resolved based on isoelectric point and by apparent molecular mass. It uses spectrally resolvable fluorescent dyes (Cy2/3/5) to prelabel samples that are then multiplexed onto the same gel, allowing for direct quantification of each resolved protein feature between the three dye channels without analytical (gel-to-gel) variation. Multiple samples from a complex experiment can be analyzed across several DIGE gels, whereby an internal standard comprised of every sample present in the experiment is included in each multiplexed gel &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020087-b012">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020087-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;. Within each gel, quantitative measurements are made for each resolved protein feature relative to the cognate signal from the internal standard, which is then used to normalize the intragel ratios between gels in a coordinated experiment. Thus, DIGE enables multiple conditions with repetition to be quantitatively analyzed with statistical confidence. Proteins of interest are then identified using mass spectrometry (MS) and database interrogation. Multivariate algorithms, such as principle component analysis (PCA) and unsupervised hierarchical clustering, can now be applied to DIGE datasets to enable analysis of global expression patterns. Combining multivariable DIGE/MS with multivariate statistical analyses clusters cellular protein responses across distinct environmental conditions based on total expression profiles. These technologies can be combined to identify expression changes in coordinated biochemical pathways.</p><p>In this manuscript, we report the application of multivariable DIGE/MS to <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> cultures exposed to various biochemical and genetic manipulations in cellular iron status. We found that 21 distinct proteins undergo expression changes in response to exogenous hemin, representing the first reported global analysis of bacterial proteins that are affected by this host molecule. Further, through biochemical classification of proteins undergoing expression changes upon alterations in iron status, we observed an overrepresentation of proteins involved in the central metabolic pathways of <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content>. Based on these observations, a series of experiments was performed revealing that the Fur protein of iron-starved <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> redirects central metabolic pathways to increase production of lactate as a fermentative end-product.

Protein extracts from each of the four conditions were independently isolated in quadruplicate to control for nonbiological variation, and the resulting 16 extracts were simultaneously coresolved across eight DIGE gels that were coordinated by a Cy2-labeled 16-mix pooled-sample internal standard as described in Materials and Methods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020087-g001">Figure 1</xref>). PCA was used to group the 16 individual Cy3- or Cy5-labeled proteome maps based on the overall expression pattern from the more than 1,000 resolved protein forms under survey. PCA allowed for independent confirmation of distinct expression patterns from the four groups and demonstrated high reproducibility between the replicate samples. The four groups (control, iron-starved, <italic>&#x00394;fur,</italic> and hemin) all clustered into separate quadrants with only one proteome map from the hemin group clustering equidistant from the hemin group and the control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020087-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). These assignments were reiterated in an unsupervised hierarchical clustering of the independent proteome maps presented as a heat map, where expression patterns of the individual proteins can also be compared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020087-g001">Figure 1</xref>D).</p><p>DIGE analysis combined with subsequent PCA and hierarchical clustering allowed for the grouping of protein expression changes between these four conditions into the following five classes: (I) proteins that are affected by hemin independent of Fur or iron (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-0020087-t001">Table 1</xref>, proteins that are more abundant as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020087-g001">Figure 1</xref>C), (II) proteins that are negatively affected by iron and Fur (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-0020087-t002">Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020087-g001">Figure 1</xref>C), (III) proteins that are positively affected by iron and Fur (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-0020087-t003">Table 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020087-g001">Figure 1</xref>C), (IV) proteins that are affected by iron independent of Fur (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-0020087-t004">Table 4</xref>), and (V) proteins that are affected by Fur independent of iron (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-0020087-t005">Table 5</xref>). We identified 29 resolved protein features (representing 20 distinct proteins including isoforms) under iron-dependent negative control by Fur, 30 distinct features (25 proteins including isoforms) under iron-dependent positive Fur-mediated control, and 21 distinct proteins that are exclusively affected by hemin.</p><p>Using the PCA and hierarchical clustering approach, we were able to further group the proteome expression maps into two primary clusters, one containing all eight samples prepared from bacteria grown in TSB or TSB containing hemin and a second containing all eight samples prepared from <italic>&#x00394;fur</italic> bacteria or bacteria starved for iron.

These multivariate analyses of protein expression changes allow for a global representation of the similar patterns in protein expression that occur upon inactivation of <italic>fur</italic> versus those that occur upon iron starvation. Furthermore, this analysis reveals that exposure of <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> to hemin results in a vastly different, and less severe, change in cellular protein expression as compared to altering the iron status of the bacterium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020087-g001">Figure 1</xref>D).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title><named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> Proteins Regulated by Hemin Independently of Iron or Fur (Class I)</title><p>The reactive nature of heme presents a unique problem to bacterial pathogens, as they must maintain an intracellular heme homeostasis that prevents toxicity while internalizing enough heme for nutrient iron needs &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020087-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;. This raises the possibility that bacterial pathogens undergo a coordinated change in protein expression in response to exogenous heme. To identify proteins that respond to heme, we grew <italic>S. aureus</italic> in the presence of 10 &#x003bc;M hemin and identified proteins that change expression upon hemin exposure but not upon inactivation of <italic>fur</italic> or iron starvation. Twenty-one proteins were identified that responded exclusively to excess hemin with statistical confidence (0.04 &#x0003e; <italic>p</italic> &#x0003e; 0.0000037), 16 of which were down-regulated between 1.25-fold and 3.6-fold (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-0020087-t001">Table 1</xref>). These proteins represent a variety of predicted biochemical functions without clear overrepresentation of any one physiological pathway. Only five proteins increased expression exclusively in response to hemin, comprising a hemin-activated regulon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020087-g001">Figure 1</xref>C). These proteins are involved in lactate metabolism (Ddh, 5.26-fold, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.000067), gene regulation (SaeR, 1.34-fold, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.02), and stress response (YaaD, 3.78-fold, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.000037, ClpL, 1.58-fold, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.033). The fifth protein, a putative conserved ABC transporter (SAV2359), exhibited a 45-fold increase (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.0000037) upon exposure to hemin, and is predicted to encode for a conserved transporter with no demonstrated function. These experiments describe the first global analysis of the heme-regulon of a bacterial pathogen and identify a putative transport system that is highly up-regulated exclusively upon exposure to hemin.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>The Hrt System Is Required for <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> Growth in Hemin</title><p>The protein demonstrating the most significant increase upon hemin exposure (45-fold increase) is an ATP-binding component (SAV2359) of a previously uncharacterized ABC-type transport system. The gene encoding for SAV2359 is located immediately adjacent to a predicted permease component (SAV2360) of the same transport system. Based on our proteomic observations, we have named these proteins the heme-regulated transporter ATPase (HrtA) and permease (HrtB). Importantly, genomic analyses demonstrate that this transport system is conserved across many pathogenic bacteria, including <italic>Bacillus anthracis, Listeria monocytogenes,</italic> and <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic> (unpublished data).</p><p>To explore the contribution of the Hrt system to heme transport, we investigated whether strains inactivated for <italic>hrtA</italic> or <italic>hrtB</italic> can grow when hemin is the sole available iron source. There was no detectable difference in the ability of wild-type, <italic>hrtA,</italic> and <italic>hrtB</italic> mutant strains to grow in medium where the sole iron source was FeSO<sub>4</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020087-g002">Figure 2</xref>). In contrast, compared to wild-type, the <italic>hrtA</italic> and <italic>hrtB</italic> mutant strains are severely impaired in their ability to grow when hemin is the sole iron source (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020087-g002">Figure 2</xref>). To further confirm that the hemin-dependent growth defect exhibited by strains inactivated for <italic>hrtA</italic> and <italic>hrtB</italic> is dependent on the insertional mutations, and as an attempt to rule out the possibility that the observed growth defects were due to secondary mutations, we transduced the <italic>hrtA</italic> and <italic>hrtB</italic> mutations into a clean wild-type background as previously described &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020087-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;. Successful transductants exhibited identical phenotypes as the original <italic>hrtA</italic> or the <italic>hrtB</italic> mutants, suggesting that inactivation of the Hrt system is responsible for the observed inability to grow in the presence of high hemin concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020087-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Taken together, these observations identify the HrtAB as a novel staphylococcal heme transport system that is critically important to proper heme metabolism.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title><named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> Proteins Negatively Regulated by Iron and Fur (Class II)</title><p>Proteins that increase abundance upon iron starvation or inactivation of <italic>fur</italic> (via release from repression) represent proteins negatively regulated by Fur in an iron-dependent manner, and hence comprise the canonical Fur regulon of the bacterium.

An increase in local ferrous iron concentrations would significantly relieve the iron stress placed on the bacterium and provide a growth advantage to invading staphylococci.

The NHS-ester dyes Cy2/3/5 were used for the minimal labeling protocol using an internal standard &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020087-b012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020087-b013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020087-b046">46</xref>&#x0005d;. Briefly, one-third of each sample (10 &#x003bc;l, 83 &#x003bc;g) was removed and combined into a single tube to comprise the pooled-sample internal standard (1,330 &#x003bc;g total). The remaining two-thirds of each individual sample (20 &#x003bc;l, 167 &#x003bc;g) was individually labeled with 200 pmol of either Cy3 or Cy5, while the pooled-sample was labeled en masse with 1,600 pmol of Cy2. The samples were quenched with 10 mM lysine (2 &#x003bc;l for each 200 pmol) for 10 min on ice, followed by the addition of equal volume 2&#x000d7; rehydration buffer (7 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 4&#x00025; CHAPS, 4 mg/ml DTT). Pairs of Cy3/Cy5-labeled samples were mixed with an equal aliquot of the Cy2-labeled internal standard according to the schema in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020087-g001">Figure 1</xref>. Tripartite samples were brought up to 450 &#x003bc;l with 1&#x000d7; rehydration buffer (same as 2&#x000d7; buffer but with 2 mg/ml DTT and 0.5&#x00025; IPG buffer 4&#x02013;7) and passively rehydrated into 24-cm 4&#x02013;7 immobilized pH gradient (IPG) strips for 24 h (total of 500 &#x003bc;g per gel).</p><p>All 2D DIGE-associated instrumentation was manufactured by GE Healthcare/Amersham Biosciences (Piscataway, New Jersey). First-dimensional separations were performed on a manifold-equipped IPGphor first-dimension isoelectric focusing unit, and second-dimensional 12&#x00025; SDS-PAGE was carried out using hand-cast gels that had one plate presilanized (to ensure subsequent accurate robotic protein excision) using an Ettan DALT 12 unit, both according to the manufacturer's protocols. Cy2/3/5-specific 16-bit data files were acquired at 100 &#x003bc;m resolution separately by dye-specific excitation and emission wavelengths using a Typhoon 9400 Variable Mode Imager, and the gels were stained for total protein content with SyproRuby (Molecular Probes/Invitrogen) per the manufacturer's instructions.</p><p>The DeCyder v6.5 suite of software tools (Amersham Biosciences/GE Healthcare) was used for DIGE analysis. The normalized volume ratio of each individual protein spot-feature from a Cy3- or Cy5-labeled sample was directly quantified relative to the Cy2-signal from the pooled-sample internal standard corresponding to the same spot-feature. This is performed for all resolved features in a single gel where no gel-to-gel variation exists between the three co-resolved signals. The individual signals from the Cy2-standard were then used to normalize and compare Cy3:Cy2 and Cy5:Cy2 abundance ratios across the eight-gel set, enabling statistical confidence to be associated with each change in abundance or charge-altering post-translational modification using Student's <italic>t</italic>-test and ANOVA analyses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0020087-st001">Table S1</xref>). Unsupervised PCA and hierarchical clustering was performed using the DeCyder Extended Data Analysis (EDA) module.</p><p>Proteins of interest were robotically excised, digested into peptides in-gel with modified porcine trypsin protease (Trypsin Gold; Promega, Madison, Wisconsin, United States) and peptides applied to a stainless steel target using an integrated Spot Handling Workstation per the manufacturer's recommendations. Matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization, time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and data-dependant TOF/TOF tandem MS/MS was performed on a Voyager 4700 (Applied Biosystems, Framingham, Massachusetts, United States). The resulting peptide mass maps and the associated fragmentation spectra were collectively used to interrogate <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> Mu50 sequences to generate statistically significant candidate identifications using GPS Explorer software (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California, United States) running the MASCOT search algorithm (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.matrixscience.com">http://www.matrixscience.com</ext-link>). Searches were performed allowing for complete carbamidomethylation of cysteine, partial oxidation of methionine residues, and one missed cleavage. Molecular Weight Search (MOWSE) scores, number of matched ions, number of matching ions with independent MS/MS matches, percent protein sequence coverage, and correlation of gel region with predicted MW and pI were collectively considered for each protein identification (all data are presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat-0020087-st001">Table S1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Growth curve assays.</title><p><named-content content-type="genus-species">S. aureus</named-content> cultures were grown overnight under low-iron conditions by inoculating strains in RPMI supplemented with 1&#x00025; casamino acids plus 200 &#x003bc;M DIP.

Cultures were grown at 37 &#x000b0;C with aeration in a round-bottom 96-well plate and bacterial growth was monitored by increase of absorbance (O.D.<sub>600</sub>) over time.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Measuring pH, transferrin-Fe release, and lactate.</title><p>Bacteria were grown in 10 ml of tryptic soy broth (TSB) in a 50-ml flask for 15 h at 37 &#x000b0;C with 180 rpm shaking. All strains containing derivatives of pOS1 were grown in the presence of 10 &#x003bc;g/ml chloramphenicol to ensure successful maintenance of the plasmid and to normalize growth conditions. Iron was chelated from the media by adding DIP to a final concentration of 1 mM. After 15 h, the cultures were centrifuged and the supernatants were collected. All pH values were measured using a S20 SevenEasy pH meter (Mettler Toledo).</p><p>Measuring the release of iron from transferrin was performed as previously described &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020087-b047">47</xref>&#x0005d;. Iron-bound transferrin exhibits an absorption peak at 470 nm. As iron dissociates from transferrin the intensity of the peak at 470 nm absorption decreases. Absorption at 470 nm was measured every 30 s for 15 min upon introduction of the samples. Transferrin stock solutions of 400 &#x003bc;M were prepared by suspending human transferrin (Sigma, St. Louis, Missouri, United States) in distilled water. Transferrin stock solutions were added at a final concentration of 40 &#x003bc;M to all samples. All absorption readings were measured using a Cary 100 UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Varian).</p><p>To measure lactate concentrations, bacteria were grown in 5 ml (TSB) for 15 h at 37 &#x000b0;C with 180 rpm shaking. Lactate levels were measured using a Lactate Assay Kit according to manufacturer's recommendations (Department of Biochemistry at The State University of New York at Buffalo). This kit measures the lactic acid&#x02013;dependent production of formazan which exhibits an absorption maximum of 492 nm and is directly proportional to the concentration of lactate.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="ppat-0020087-st001"><label>Table S1</label><caption><title>Master Table of All DIGE Profiling and MS Database Search Results</title><p>(671 KB XLS)</p></caption><media xlink:href="ppat.0020087.st001.xls" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.ms-excel"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank members of the Skaar lab for critical reading of the manuscript and the Vanderbilt Academic Venture Capitol fund for Proteomics.
