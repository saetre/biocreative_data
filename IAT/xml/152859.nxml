The discovery of the cleavage of &#x003bb; CI repressor, and later of LexA repressor, by activated RecA in an ATP- and ssDNA-dependent reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg256c5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg256c7">7</xref>) led to an understanding of the initiation of the SOS regulatory system. In brief, stalled DNA replication results in the production of ssDNA regions, to which RecA protein binds and forms nucleoprotein filaments in an ATP-dependent manner. This ssDNA-bound RecA then promotes the self-cleavage of the LexA and &#x003bb; CI repressors or UmuD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg256c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg256c9">9</xref>). The cleavage of LexA relieves the repression on SOS genes that were repressed during normal growth. LexA repressor alone controls the expression of more than 30 SOS genes, encoding proteins that function in DNA repair, recombination, mutagenesis and so on (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg256c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg256c10">10</xref>). The cleavage of &#x003bb; CI repressors induces the temperate phage &#x003bb; to multiply and eventually lyse the host cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg256c11">11</xref>), while that of UmuD allows error-prone DNA replication to bypass damaged bases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg256c12">12</xref>).</p><p>The ssDNA-bound RecA promotes these cleavage reactions, but RecA does not work as the primary protease, with the actual chemistry of catalysis being carried out by the LexA or &#x003bb; CI repressors or UmuD. The term &#x02018;co-protease activity&#x02019; was put forward to emphasise this function of RecA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg256c11">11</xref>). The nucleoprotein filament constituted by the ATP (or ATP&#x003b3;S)-bound form of RecA and ssDNA interacts with free double-stranded (ds)DNA to promote heteroduplex formation between the ssDNA and the complementary strand of the dsDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg256c13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg256c15">15</xref>). Story <italic>et al</italic>. determined the crystal structure of a helical filament of the ADP-bound state of RecA and proposed that an intermolecular cleft located between two adjacent RecA monomers in the filament acts as the cleavable repressor protein binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg256c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg256c17">17</xref>).</p><p>As described, the mechanism of initiation of SOS response has been relatively well studied, but much less is known regarding events leading to the termination of the SOS response. It had been reported that with the repair of damaged DNA, LexA re-accumulates, probably due to a decrease in the co-protease activity of RecA, to repress the SOS genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg256c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg256c18">18</xref>). <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> DinI protein, the expression of which is under the control of the SOS response, shuts off initiation of the SOS response when overexpressed <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg256c19">19</xref>). Moreover, purified DinI was found to inhibit the co-protease activity of RecA <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg256c20">20</xref>). This active &#x02018;shut-off&#x02019; mechanism is crucial for survival, since certain SOS functions such as phage induction and mutagenesis are harmful to cells. The recently determined solution structure of DinI indicated that the negatively charged C-terminus, by mimicking the DNA backbone, probably competes with ssDNA for the RecA binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg256c21">21</xref>). On the other hand, Yasuda <italic>et al</italic>. reported that DinI binds to the ssDNA&#x02013;RecA&#x02013;ATP&#x003b3;S filament and inhibits the co-protease activity without dissociation of the complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg256c22">22</xref>). More recently, Voloshin <italic>et al</italic>. reported that ssDNA was displaced from the ssDNA&#x02013;RecA&#x02013;ATP&#x003b3;S filament in the presence of excess amounts of DinI, corroborating the results from their earlier structural studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg256c23">23</xref>).</p><p>Thus, both groups have observed the physical interaction of DinI with RecA, but obtained conflicting results regarding the effects on the DNA binding of RecA. In the present study, we applied NMR spectroscopy to investigate the interaction of DinI and RecA, using DinI labelled with stable isotopes and various RecA fragments. In addition, the effect of DinI binding on the ssDNA&#x02013;RecA interaction was investigated by the analysis of transferred NOEs (TRNOE) of ssDNA, originating from the RecA-bound state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg256c24">24</xref>). We have also determined the solution structure of recombinant DinI using multidimensional NMR spectroscopy. Based on the results obtained, we present possible mechanisms of interaction between DinI and activated RecA for the inhibition of co-protease activity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Protein expression and preparation of <italic>E.coli</italic> DinI</title><p>The <italic>dinI</italic> gene was cloned from <italic>E.coli</italic> genomic DNA using the primers 5&#x02032;-CTGGGATCCATGCGAATTGAA and 3&#x02032;-CCC GGGAATTCTTATTCGCTGAC by PCR.

Consistent with this observation, NMR signals of concentrated samples were broader than those expected for a 9 kDa protein, and thus the assignment of side chain resonances benefited from the HCCH-TOCSY spectrum. Indeed, DinI behaved as dimers during purification, for which DinI fractions were highly concentrated before application onto the column. To confirm the dimeric behavior of DinI, the molecular weight was analysed using Superdex 200 HR 10&#x0002f;30 (Amersham Biosciences) gel filtration column chromatography containing appropriate molecular weight markers and was estimated to be &#x0223c;16 kDa (data not shown). Voloshin <italic>et al</italic>. also reported a similar behaviour of DinI in their study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg256c23">23</xref>). However, we found that the NMR signals were broadened in a concentration-dependent manner, with a significant improvement in line width upon reducing the concentration below 1.0 mM (data not shown), suggesting that DinI does not form a stable homodimer. This conclusion was also supported by the absence of intermolecular NOEs measured on a 1:1 mixture (0.5 mM each) of unlabelled and <sup>13</sup>C&#x0002f;<sup>15</sup>N-labelled proteins (data not shown). We therefore concluded that the NMR signal contribution from monomeric species should be predominant at protein concentrations around 1.0 mM (broader line shapes are observed if the predominant species is a dimer) and performed measurements for resonance assignments and structural analysis at this concentration.</p><p>Backbone <sup>1</sup>H, <sup>13</sup>C and <sup>15</sup>N resonances were assigned (including the extra five amino acid residues at the N-terminus) by analysis of spin&#x02013;spin connectivities in 3D CBCA(CO)NNH and HNCACB spectra. Side chain <sup>1</sup>H and <sup>13</sup>C resonance assignments, excluding aromatics, were obtained from the analysis of 3D HNHB, CC(CO)NH, H(CCCO)NH and HCCH-TOCSY spectra. Further, side chain NH<sub>2</sub> (Asn&#x0002f;Gln), NH<sub>&#x003b5;</sub> (Arg) and NH<sub>&#x003b5;1</sub> (Trp) resonances and other aromatic side chain resonances were assigned by the analysis of intraresidue NOEs from 3D <sup>15</sup>N-separated and <sup>13</sup>C-separated NOESY spectra, respectively. Chemical shift assignments are listed in Supplementary Material (Table S1).</p><p>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg256f1">1</xref> shows the solution structures of DinI calculated from a total of 2617 unambiguous and 572 ambiguous NOEs, 74 hydrogen bond-derived distance restraints and 61 &#x003c6;&#x0002f;&#x003c8; dihedral angle restraints. The mean root mean square deviation (rmsd) from the average for backbone C&#x003b1;, N and C&#x02032; atoms and all non-proton atoms in residues 1&#x02013;78 were 0.56 and 1.01 &#x0212b;, respectively. Structural statistics of the final ensemble of 20 refined structures are presented in Supplementary Material (Table S2). The structure consists of two &#x003b1;-helices and a three-stranded &#x003b2;-sheet, as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg256f1">1</xref>B, and is almost identical to the recently published solution structure of DinI (PDB accession code 1GGH, previously 1F0A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg256c21">21</xref>). The rmsd between the average structures from these two different solution structure ensembles was as low as 1.31 &#x0212b; for backbone C&#x003b1; atoms in residues 1&#x02013;78, in spite of the slightly different structure calculation approaches employed (while Ramirez <italic>et al</italic>. used a limited NOE supplemented with residual dipolar coupling based strategy, we relied on a solely NOE based approach that included use of ambiguous NOE restraints). The regions with slightly larger rmsd were localised to the N-terminus of the second &#x003b2;-strand, the N-terminus of the second &#x003b1;-helix and the C-terminus of the protein. The C-terminal region of the protein is primarily not well defined in our ensemble of structures. The differences in the other two regions can be attributed to their proximity to the slightly longer non-structured N-terminal extension present in our construct, in addition to the slightly different buffer and experimental conditions employed. The differences in C&#x003b1; position between the average structures of DinI from the two NMR studies are presented as Supplementary Material (Figure S1).</p></sec><sec><title>Interaction between DinI and full-length RecA</title><p>Both Yasuda <italic>et al</italic>. and Voloshin <italic>et al</italic>. have reported that DinI associates with RecA directly, based on biochemical and genetic studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg256c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg256c23">23</xref>). We therefore measured <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N HSQC spectra of DinI with and without RecA in order to detect this interaction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg256f2">2</xref>). Upon the addition of a half-molar equivalent of RecA to <sup>15</sup>N-labelled DinI, the signal intensity of DinI was approximately halved (data not shown). No change was observed in the chemical shifts or the line shapes of the remaining signals. When the concentration of RecA was increased to equimolar amounts, the NMR signals of DinI were almost completely suppressed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg256f2">2</xref>B) except for some sharp signals from the side chain NH<sub>2</sub> groups and backbone amide groups of the N-terminal vector-derived residues. From the knowledge that RecA polymerises and forms a large protein complex even in the absence of DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg256c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg256c43">43</xref>), the loss in the signal intensity (attenuation of the signal) can be explained by the extreme line broadening of NMR signals induced by rapid transverse relaxation of the RecA-bound fraction of DinI. Therefore, the result of this NMR titration experiment confirmed that DinI binds tightly to RecA.</p><p>When the NaCl concentration in the 1:1 mixture of <sup>15</sup>N-labelled DinI and RecA was increased from 50 to 250 mM, the signal intensity over the entire region was slightly restored (data not shown). This indicates that a fraction of the RecA-bound DinI was released with the increase in NaCl concentration, since the <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N HSQC spectrum of DinI alone does not change significantly between 50 and 250 mM NaCl (data not shown). The reduced population of RecA-bound DinI at higher salt concentrations probably reflects the importance of the electrostatic contribution to the DinI&#x02013;RecA interaction, although we cannot completely exclude the indirect effects of increased salt concentration.</p></sec><sec><title>Interaction between DinI and RecA fragments</title><p>In order to obtain a more detailed picture on the interaction of DinI with RecA, we prepared three RecA fragments, RecA<sub>1&#x02013;33</sub>, RecA<sub>268&#x02013;330</sub> and RecA<sub>&#x00394;1&#x02013;33</sub> (corresponding to the N- and C-terminal domains and an N-terminally truncated fragment, respectively), according to the crystal structure of RecA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg256c16">16</xref>). It has been reported that deletion of RecA<sub>1&#x02013;33</sub> leads to a decrease in the self-assembly of RecA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg256c27">27</xref>), whereas RecA<sub>268&#x02013;330</sub> plays an important role for dsDNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg256c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg256c44">44</xref>). RecA<sub>&#x00394;1&#x02013;33</sub> was used for NMR experiments, instead of the fragments encompassing the central region between the N- and C-terminal domains of RecA (referred to as the &#x02018;central region&#x02019;), which could not be prepared in a soluble form (unpublished observations). RecA<sub>&#x00394;1&#x02013;33</sub> exists in an almost monomeric state at low concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg256c28">28</xref>). The interactions of DinI with the three different RecA fragments were then examined by NMR titration experiments. In the case of RecA<sub>1&#x02013;33</sub> and RecA<sub>268&#x02013;330</sub>, no significant changes in cross-peak intensities and chemical shifts were observed. In contrast, addition of RecA<sub>&#x00394;1&#x02013;33</sub> to <sup>15</sup>N-labelled DinI showed a decrease in cross-peak intensities but no change in chemical shifts or line shapes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg256f2">2</xref>C), resembling the results for full-length RecA. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg256f3">3</xref> summarises the changes in cross-peak intensity during the titration experiments with RecA<sub>1&#x02013;33</sub>, RecA<sub>268&#x02013;330</sub> and RecA<sub>&#x00394;1&#x02013;33</sub>. It is obvious that neither RecA<sub>1&#x02013;33</sub> nor RecA<sub>268&#x02013;330</sub> interacts with DinI, whereas RecA<sub>&#x00394;1&#x02013;33</sub> tightly binds to DinI. However, RecA<sub>&#x00394;1&#x02013;33</sub> showed less cross-peak intensity attenuation compared to full-length RecA (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg256f2">2</xref>C).</p></sec><sec><title>Effect of DinI on the interaction of RecA&#x02013;ATP&#x003b3;S with 4mer ssDNA</title><p>Next, we proceeded to determine the effect of DinI binding on the integrity of the ssDNA&#x02013;RecA&#x02013;ATP&#x003b3;S complex. We had previously reported that TRNOEs were observable for oligo ssDNA in the presence of RecA and proposed an unusual extended DNA structure through deoxyribose&#x02013;base stacking induced by RecA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg256c24">24</xref>). To investigate the influence of DinI on the interaction between ssDNA and RecA, we measured 2D transferred NOESY spectra of a 4mer ssDNA, ATP&#x003b3;S and RecA mixture with and without DinI and probed for changes in the patterns of TRNOE-derived cross-peaks. The sample containing 4mer ssDNA and ATP&#x003b3;S showed only few positive NOE cross-peaks in the 2D transferred NOESY spectrum (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg256f4">4</xref>A), as described by Nishinaka <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg256c24">24</xref>). TRNOEs due to the RecA-bound state of 4mer ssDNA were observed in the 2D transferred NOESY spectrum in the presence of ATP&#x003b3;S and RecA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg256f4">4</xref>B), whereas no TRNOEs were found for the sample containing 4mer ssDNA, ATP&#x003b3;S and DinI, suggesting that DinI failed to bind ssDNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg256f4">4</xref>C). Finally, the addition of DinI into the mixture of 4mer ssDNA, ATP&#x003b3;S and RecA caused no significant change in TRNOE-derived cross-peaks (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg256f4">4</xref>D). These results not only eliminate the idea that DinI alters the 4mer ssDNA binding activity of RecA, but also discount the possibility that DinI inhibits the interaction between 4mer ssDNA and RecA&#x02013;ATP&#x003b3;S. Since it was already reported that one RecA molecule binds to three bases of ssDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg256c43">43</xref>), we further analysed the interactions with longer ssDNA (8mer and 12mer).</p></sec><sec><title>Effect of DinI on the interaction of RecA&#x02013;ATP&#x003b3;S with 8mer and 12mer ssDNA</title><p>In the presence of RecA, the signals from ssDNA were broadened due to the fast exchange between the free and RecA-bound states (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg256f5">5</xref>B) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg256c24">24</xref>). For the interaction of 4mer ssDNA and RecA&#x02013;ATP&#x003b3;S, addition of DinI caused negligible changes in the DNA line shape (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg256f5">5</xref>, left column). In contrast, addition of DinI sharpened the signals from both 8mer and 12mer ssDNA in the presence of RecA and ATP&#x003b3;S (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg256f5">5</xref>, centre and right columns). The narrowing of line shape specifically occurred for the signals from ssDNA, but not for ATP&#x003b3;S, which also showed line broadening because of fast exchange between the free and RecA-bound states. This result indicates the possibility that DinI alters the exchange regime of ssDNA for RecA&#x02013;ATP&#x003b3;S. One possible cause of this altered exchange of RecA-bound ssDNA is a change in the affinity of ssDNA for the RecA&#x02013;ATP&#x003b3;S in the presence of DinI. On the other hand, changes in TRNOE patterns caused by the addition of DinI were observed in the 2D transferred NOESY spectra of 8mer and 12mer ssDNA in the presence of RecA and ATP&#x003b3;S (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg256f6">6</xref>). Most of the TRNOE cross-peaks induced by the interaction with RecA were still observed at a similar position, but had attenuated intensities. In addition, for some cross-peaks, increased intensities were observed upon the addition of DinI.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Using NMR spectroscopy we showed that DinI binds to RecA in a 1:1 stoichiometry. This result is consistent with the observations of Yasuda <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg256c22">22</xref>). NMR titration experiments of DinI with three RecA fragments showed that the DinI-binding interface of RecA is not located in the N- or C-terminal domains, suggesting that (i) the central region of RecA or (ii) the region between the central region and N- or C-terminal domains or (iii) the intermolecular clefts between neighbouring RecA in the filament may be responsible for DinI-binding activity. If the region between the central region and N- or C-terminal domains in fact binds to DinI, it should be manifested in the NMR spectra upon titrating DinI with the individual domains. The lack of changes in the HSQC spectra of DinI argues against a role for these regions in DinI binding. Even though both RecA<sub>&#x00394;1&#x02013;33</sub> and full-length RecA caused similar attenuation for almost the entire region of DinI, the level of attenuation by RecA<sub>&#x00394;1&#x02013;33</sub> was lower. Supposing that the DinI-binding site is located in the intermolecular cleft rather than the central region, this difference in affinity for DinI between the full-length RecA and RecA<sub>&#x00394;1&#x02013;33</sub> may be explained by considering the altered oligomerisation properties of the two RecA samples. Although RecA<sub>&#x00394;1&#x02013;33</sub> reportedly retained most of the activities of full-length RecA, it was however defective in self-assembly at lower concentrations, &#x0223c;0.05 mM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg256c28">28</xref>). In the range of concentrations used for the titration experiments, the majority of RecA<sub>&#x00394;1&#x02013;33</sub> is probably in the monomeric state (T. Mikawa and S. Kuramitsu, personal communication), whereas under similar conditions, a large population of the full-length RecA is oligomerised. At lower concentrations, RecA<sub>&#x00394;1&#x02013;33</sub> did bind to DinI as opposed to the N- and C-terminal regions, whereas it was weaker than that of full-length RecA at the same concentration. However, at higher concentrations (0.2 mM) RecA<sub>&#x00394;1&#x02013;33</sub> showed comparable attenuation of DinI signals to full-length RecA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg256f2">2</xref>C). Hence, the similarity in DinI binding to concentrated RecA<sub>&#x00394;1&#x02013;33</sub> and full-length RecA could be attributed to their similar oligomeric natures. This leaves us with the possibility that the DinI-binding surface may be located in the intermolecular clefts and the decreased affinity of DinI for low concentrations of RecA<sub>&#x00394;1&#x02013;33</sub> could be explained by the fewer intermolecular clefts available for binding.</p><p>In addition to the above possibility, we investigated the influence of DinI on the integrity of the activated nucleoprotein filament of RecA (ssDNA&#x02013;RecA&#x02013;ATP&#x003b3;S). Our transferred NOESY experiments did not show any significant effect of DinI on the interaction of 4mer ssDNA with RecA&#x02013;ATP&#x003b3;S, suggesting that DinI does not induce the release of 4mer ssDNA from RecA. In contrast, changes in the line shapes as well as NOE cross-peak patterns (increase or decrease in cross-peaks intensity) were observed in experiments with 8mer and 12mer ssDNA. This observation cannot be explained by simple attenuation in the affinity of ssDNA for RecA&#x02013; ATP&#x003b3;S. Slight conformational distortion of oligo ssDNA in the RecA-bound state or exchange between multiple conformers of RecA-bound ssDNA in the presence of DinI are some of the additional possibilities that can be considered. These contradictory results with 4mer as against 8mer and 12mer oligo ssDNA need to be addressed carefully based on the knowledge that one RecA molecule binds to three bases of ssDNA, as mentioned earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg256c43">43</xref>). In our experiments, the 8mer or 12mer ssDNA molecule presumably binds to the ssDNA-binding site presented by two or more adjacent RecA molecules, whereby cooperative effects between neighbouring molecules come into the picture. Thus, there is a possibility that though DinI binding did not affect the ssDNA-binding site of a single RecA molecule, yet the putative cooperative interactions of RecA in the nucleoprotein filament were somehow altered.</p><p>Our transferred NOE results were inconsistent with the results of Voloshin <italic>et al</italic>., where they showed that DinI displaced ssDNA from the RecA&#x02013;ssDNA complex. However, in their case, the displacement of ssDNA from the complex was hardly detectable when ssDNA&#x02013;RecA&#x02013;ATP&#x003b3;S complex was mixed with DinI at near equimolar amounts (the conditions employed in our study), but was significant at higher DinI concentration (15-fold or more compared to RecA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg256c23">23</xref>). On the other hand, Yasuda <italic>et al</italic>. reported that DinI neither prevented the formation of ssDNA&#x02013;RecA&#x02013; ATP&#x003b3;S complex (over 30-fold DinI to RecA condition) nor drastically altered the structure of the ssDNA&#x02013;RecA&#x02013;ATP&#x003b3;S complex (2-fold DinI to RecA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg256c22">22</xref>). This latter result of Yasuda <italic>et al</italic>. is consistent with the results from TRNOE experiments, performed under equimolar DinI to RecA conditions. However, limitations of the TRNOE method (use of longer oligo ssDNA, higher concentrations of each component, etc.) prevented us from performing experiments involving higher ratios of DinI to RecA, as reported by these two groups. Nevertheless, as mentioned above, our transferred NOESY experiments, performed at 1:1 DinI to RecA stoichiometry, provide enough evidence to suggest the possibility that DinI alters the nature of the ssDNA&#x02013;RecA&#x02013; ATP&#x003b3;S complex, without affecting the release of bound ssDNA.</p><p>Yasuda <italic>et al</italic>. reported that DinI fails to release ssDNA from the ssDNA&#x02013;RecA&#x02013;ATP&#x003b3;S complex, by examining the ssDNA-dependent ATPase activity of a poly(dT)&#x02013;RecA&#x02013; ATP&#x003b3;S complex at various DinI concentrations, keeping the DNA concentration sufficiently high (3 &#x000b5;M) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg256c22">22</xref>). Under such high DNA conditions it is difficult to observe minor alterations in ATPase activity upon the addition of DinI. We therefore performed a similar set of experiments by varying the DNA concentrations (0&#x02013;16 &#x000b5;M) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg256c45">45</xref>) at a fixed DinI concentration, thereby ensuring increased sensitivity of the assay to low level changes in ATPase activity that may be induced by DinI. The results showed that DinI did not affect the ATPase activity even under extremely low ssDNA concentrations (data not shown), consistent with the results of Yasuda <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg256c22">22</xref>). If DinI did drastically alter the structure of the ssDNA&#x02013;RecA&#x02013; ATP&#x003b3;S complex to release the ssDNA, then it would be reflected in a decreased or abrogated ATPase activity. The fact that there is no change in ATPase activity supports our discussion on the TRNOE experiments that DinI binds to the oligo ssDNA&#x02013;RecA&#x02013;ATP&#x003b3;S complex without disassociating the complex.</p><p>The present study suggests possible mechanisms by which DinI suppresses the co-protease activity of RecA against self-cleavable proteins. The region where the central region and the intermolecular clefts are exposed on the outer surface of the RecA filament has been proposed by Story <italic>et al</italic>. to serve as the hypothetical repressor-binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg256c16">16</xref>). They also discussed that this region presents an optimal binding surface to accommodate smaller sized proteins such as LexA, &#x003bb; CI, UmuD and so on. Harmon <italic>et al</italic>. have reported that LexA binds within a deep helical groove on the active RecA filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg256c46">46</xref>). Based on the above discussions, we can interpret our results as suggesting that the DinI-binding region on RecA overlaps with those of the repressors. Thus, in line with the prevailing hypothesis, prevention of RecA&#x02013;repressor interaction by DinI binding to the intermolecular clefts probably inhibits the co-protease activity of RecA, leading to the termination of the SOS reaction. On the other hand, Mustard and Little suggested that &#x003bb; CI and UmuD bind to the intermolecular clefts in RecA, whereas LexA does not bind in this region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg256c9">9</xref>). This indicates that the binding sites on RecA for different repressors might not be localised to the cleft region. Hence, simple competition for repressor-binding sites by DinI may not be sufficient to completely suppress the co-protease activity of RecA. Thus, in addition to the above, DinI-induced minor conformational changes in the ssDNA&#x02013; RecA&#x02013;ATP&#x003b3;S complex also probably function to inhibit the RecA co-protease activity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL</title><p>Supplementary Material is available at NAR Online.</p><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Material]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="nar_31_6_1735__index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="nar_31_6_1735__1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkg256f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Solution structure of DinI.
