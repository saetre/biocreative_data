One of the most common inducible defense mechanisms is systemic acquired resistance (SAR). SAR can be triggered by infection with certain pathogenic strains. The induced resistance is typically effective against a wide range of pathogens including those taxonomically unrelated to the SAR inducing organism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>Salicylic acid (SA) is a signaling molecule of the SAR pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Exogenous application of SA increases the resistance of tobacco plants to tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. SAR can be induced effectively by exogenous applications of either SA or synthetic functional analogs of SA, 2,6-dichloroisonicotinic acid (INA) and benzo (1,2,3) thiadiazole-7-carbo-thioic acid S-methyl ester (BTH) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In addition to signaling SAR, SA regulates both basal and <italic>R</italic>-gene mediated local disease resistance mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>The development of SAR is associated with the induction of pathogenesis related (<italic>PR</italic>) gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Increases in the endogenous SA levels in the pathogen-inoculated plants coincide with the increased levels of the <italic>PR </italic>gene expression and enhanced disease resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Transgenic plants expressing the bacterial salicylate hydroxylase (<italic>nahG</italic>) gene cannot accumulate SA and fail to express SAR development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The <italic>PR </italic>genes, known as the SAR markers, have been identified from several plant species including tobacco and Arabidopsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. A soybean <italic>PR1 </italic>homolog, <italic>GmPR1 </italic>is induced by both SA treatment and infection of soybean leaves with <italic>soybean mosaic virus </italic>(SMV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p><bold><italic>n</italic></bold><italic>on-expressor of </italic><bold><italic>PR1 </italic></bold>(<italic>NPR1</italic>) is a regulatory gene of the SA signal pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. <italic>NPR1 </italic>is also known as <bold><italic>n</italic></bold><italic>on-inducible </italic><bold><italic>im</italic></bold><italic>munity 1 </italic>(<italic>NIM1</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] or <italic>salicylic acid insensitive 1 </italic>(<italic>SAI1</italic>)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The <italic>NPR1 </italic>gene encodes a protein containing a bipartite nuclear localization sequence and two protein-protein interactive domains, a multiple ankyrin repeat domain and a BTB/POZ domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Both motifs mediate the interactions of NPR1/NIM1 protein with other proteins. NPR1 is an oligomeric, cytosolic protein. Either following pathogenic infection or in response to SA treatment, NPR1 oligomer becomes monomer and moves into the nucleus to activate transcription of pathogenesis-related (<italic>PR</italic>) genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The NPR1 protein is also homologous to the I&#x003ba;-B and the cactus regulatory proteins found in vertebrates and flies, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Both genes are involved in pathways controlling innate immunity in animals. The <italic>npr1 </italic>mutants with mutations in <italic>NPR1 </italic>are sensitive to SA toxicity. In the <italic>npr1 </italic>mutant plants, induction of <italic>PR </italic>genes and pathogen resistance by SA are abolished. In spite of their ability to accumulate SA, mutant plants are unable to induce SAR indicating that NPR1 is required for the SAR signal transduction pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>SAR inducers have been used in various field studies on several crop plants to reduce disease incidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. In all of these studies, SAR inducers led to reduced disease symptom development. Overexpression of Arabidopsis <italic>NPR1 </italic>or its orthologues in transgenic plants has been shown to induce broad-spectrum resistance. For example, overexpression of <italic>NPR1 </italic>led to development of constitutive enhanced resistance against the bacterial pathogen <italic>Pseudomonas syringae </italic>and the oomycete pathogen <italic>Hyaloperonospora parasitica </italic>in Arabidopsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Overexpression of <italic>NPR1 </italic>and the rice homolog of <italic>NPR1, NH1 </italic>resulted in enhanced resistance against the blast pathogen, <italic>Xanthomonas oryzae </italic>pv. <italic>oryzae </italic>in transgenic rice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. In tomato, overexpression of the Arabidopsis <italic>NPR1 </italic>gene resulted in an enhanced level of resistance to bacterial and <italic>Fusarium </italic>wilts and a moderate level of resistance against gray leaf spot and bacterial spot diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Similarly, wheat plants transformed with Arabidopsis <italic>NPR1 </italic>resulted in enhanced resistance against <italic>Fusarium graminearum </italic>that causes <italic>Fusarium </italic>head blight in wheat and barley [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. These studies suggest that manipulated expression of <italic>NPR1 </italic>or its orthologues can create broad-spectrum resistance in crop plants, and therefore, could be a suitable strategy in improving crop plants for disease resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>In the United States, soybean suffers annual yield losses valued at more than 2.6 billion dollars from various pathogenic diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. SAR in soybean was first reported following infection with <italic>Colletotrichum trancatum </italic>that causes anthracnose disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. A significant reduction in lesion sizes following <italic>C. trancatum </italic>infection was noted in epicotyls, when cotyledons were pre-injected with <italic>C. trancatum </italic>and <italic>C. lagenarium </italic>spore suspensions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. We investigated if SAR in soybean is regulated by a pathway, similar to the one characterized in Arabidopsis. We have shown that there are two orthologous <italic>NPR1 </italic>copies in soybean. Non conservation of the Arabidopsis Cys<sup>216 </sup>residue in GmNPR1s suggests that either conserved Cys<sup>82</sup>, Cys<sup>150</sup>, Cys<sup>155</sup>, Cys<sup>160 </sup>residues are sufficient for GmNPR1s' monomerization or some other soybean cysteine residue(s) complements the Arabidopsis Cys<sup>216 </sup>function.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>INA induces the <italic>PR-1 </italic>gene expression in soybean</title><p>Earlier a soybean <italic>PR1 </italic>homolog, <italic>GmPR1 </italic>was shown to be induced by both SA treatment and infection of soybean leaves with SMV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].

For SAR, induction of <italic>GmPR1 </italic>gene, a SAR marker, is needed in non-inoculated systemic tissue to provide resistance against secondary infection. To determine if pathogenic infection can also lead to <italic>GmPR1 </italic>expression in systemic tissues, hypocotyls of young soybean seedlings were inoculated with an avirulent <italic>P. sojae </italic>race and <italic>GmPR1 </italic>expression was monitored at the site of infection and in non-inoculated systemic leaves.

Based on the results presented in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, we designed an experiment to investigate the extent of SAR induction in soybean. Wounded hypocotyls of 7-day old seedlings were inoculated with avirulent strain of <italic>P. sojae </italic>and subsequently at 9, 13, 17 and 21 days after the inoculation leaves were infected with a virulent bacterial pathogen, <italic>P. syringae </italic>pv. glycinea (<italic>Psg</italic>). Four days following <italic>Psg </italic>inoculation colony forming units (cfu) of the pathogen in infected leaves were determined.

A 1.7 kb fragment of a candidate soybean <italic>NPR1 </italic>homolog was PCR-amplified from the soybean genomic DNA and named <italic>GmNPR1</italic>. DNA gel blot analysis using the <italic>GmNPR1 </italic>probe revealed that there are two copies of <italic>NPR1</italic>-like sequences in the soybean genome (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Screening of a soybean bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] for <italic>GmNPR1</italic>-like sequences resulted in identification of 18 BAC clones. DNA fingerprints of these clones for six restriction endonucleases allowed us to group these clones into two classes, Class I and Class II. None of the BAC clones contained both classes of <italic>NPR1</italic>-like sequences suggesting that they are unlikely tandem genes. Screening of a soybean cDNA library prepared from etiolated hypocotyls with <italic>GmNPR1 </italic>resulted in identification of 19 putative clones. These clones were also grouped into two classes based on their restriction patterns. One near full-length cDNA clone for each <italic>GmNPR1</italic>-like sequence was sequenced. We named these two <italic>NPR1</italic>-like sequences, <italic>GmNPR1-1 </italic>(Accession No. FJ418595) and <italic>GmNPR1-2 </italic>(Accession No. FJ418597). <italic>GmNPR1-1 </italic>and <italic>GmNPR1-2 </italic>cDNAs share 96% amino acid identity. Both GmNPR1-1 and GmNPR1-2 shared 40% amino acid identity with Arabidopsis NPR1 (AAC49611) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). The cDNA sequences were identical with their corresponding genomic sequences obtained from plasmids p143K5Xb1-2.1 (<italic>GmNPR1-1</italic>) (Accession No. FJ418594) and p101F23E1-2 (<italic>GmNPR1-2</italic>) (Accession No. FJ418596). Data obtained from DNA blot analysis and characterization of BAC and cDNA clones strongly indicated that the diploidized tetraploid soybean contained two <italic>NPR1</italic>-like sequences. In order to confirm this conclusion, we conducted nucleotide sequence comparison of the <italic>GmNPR1 </italic>genes with the soybean genome sequence <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.phytozome.net/search.php?show=blast"/>. <italic>GmNPR1 </italic>genes were identified in two scaffolds (scaffolds_159 and _213) of the soybean genome sequence. <italic>GmNPR1-1 </italic>is located in Scaffold_159 and <italic>GmNPR1-2 </italic>in Scaffold_213. Flanking regions of the two genes were compared for possible microcolinearity.
