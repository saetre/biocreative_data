Preparations from 9.5 dpc hindgut regions and 11.5 dpc genital ridges from XX embryos were sorted by FACS. The sorted population was cytospun onto slides and immunofluorescence for Oct4 was carried out on a slide from each experiment in order to determine the purity of the population after sorting.

These early changes, indicative of X chromosome reactivation, preceed detectable expression of Xi genes/transgenes reported previously.</p><p>In an earlier study we analysed <italic>Xist</italic> expression in XX PGCs and found that loss of Xist RNA occurs progressively between 10.5 and 13.5 dpc <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000860-Nesterova1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. In light of the results obtained here we have re-assessed the methods used in the earlier study and found that <italic>Xist</italic> signal was often attributable to contaminating somatic cells which, under the conditions used, showed a spurious staining using the TG1 antibody (data not shown). In this study we identified PGCs unequivocally using both TG1 and Oct4 antibodies, and in addition by sorting PGCs expressing the Oct4-GFP transgene. These factors provide strong support for the finding that loss of Xist RNA expression in the majority of PGCs occurs prior to or during germ cell migration at 9.5dpc. However, it is likely that X reactivation in PGCs is not entirely synchronous and that a minority of cells extinguish Xist expression later, following migration to the genital ridges.</p><p>Whilst it is clear that extinction of <italic>Xist</italic> expression and loss of Xist RNA dependent chromatin modifications occurs in the majority of PGCs around 9.5dpc, it does not necessarily follow that X reactivation completes at this time. Indeed reactivation of X-linked genes has only been detected in PGCs after they reach the genital ridge at 11.5 dpc <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000860-Johnston1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000860-Monk1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000860-Tam1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. A possible explanation is that reactivation of X-linked genes commences progressively during PGC migration, but that the assays used to date, all of which have analysed protein products, are not sensitive enough to detect this. Developing germ cells in other organisms show general transcriptional repression and there is some evidence that this occurs also in mammals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000860-Blackwell1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000860-Saitou1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. If so, this could contribute to PGCs showing delayed appearance of gene products from previously inactive X chromosome alleles.</p><p>The homeodomain protein Nanog, a marker of pluripotent cells, is expressed in PGCs at 8.0 dpc <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000860-Yamaguchi1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, immediately before the time we surmise <italic>Xist</italic> RNA extinction occurs.

Similarly, elevated levels of PRC2 proteins and associated H3K27me3 in PGCs resembles changes in pre-implantation embryos at the time when the paternal X chromosome is reactivated. Based on these parallels we speculate that X-reactivation in PGCs occurs as part of a program to convert the genome to a pluripotent state and that the mechanism for this is similar to that occurring in ICM cells of the developing blastocyst. Thus, similar to the situation in ICM/ES cells, X inactivation in PGCs is likely <italic>Xist</italic> dependent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000860-Mak1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000860-Okamoto1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000860-Wutz1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>.

In our analysis of PGCs we did not observe pinpoint signal indicative of transcription of either Tsix RNA or low levels of Xist RNA from either allele. Based on this we conclude that loss of <italic>Xist</italic> expression in PGCs occurs independently of <italic>Tsix</italic> transcription. Thus, a key issue for future studies is to understand the mechanism by which <italic>Xist</italic> expression is extinguished in pluripotent cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Mouse strains and embryos</title><p>Post-implantation mouse embryos were isolated from timed matings of (C57Bl/6 X CBA)F1 animals or (Oct4-GFP X Oct4-GFP) as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000860-Silva1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>.

Permeabilisation and blocking were carried out simultaneously by incubating cells for 2 hrs in 0.4 &#x00025; Triton X-100, 10 mg/ml BSA. Embryo regions were then washed three times in PBS and once in PBS/0.1&#x00025; Tween-20 for 5 min. Primary antibodies were incubated for 2 hrs in detection buffer (4&#x000d7;SSC, 1 mg/ml BSA, 0.1&#x00025; Tween-20), except for TG-1, which was used undiluted and incubated for 4 hrs. Primary antibody incubations were followed by three 5 min washes in PBS/0.1&#x00025; Tween-20. Secondary antibodies were incubated for 1 hr in detection buffer. Embryo regions were subsequently washed three times 5 min in PBS/0.1&#x00025; Tween-20, rinsed in PBS and mounted on chamber slides in Vectashield antifade containing DAPI. In experiments using both TG1 and anti-Eed antibodies, TG-1 incubation and detection was carried out first. After extensive washing, anti-Oct4 were incubated and detected as described. All steps, except antibody incubations, were carried out in net inserts (Corning incorporated) placed in wells of 24 well plates. Nets, containing the embryonic regions, were transferred between wells and solutions.

Embryo regions containing PGCs from female embryos were pooled and then trypsinised in a tube (37&#x000b0;C). Trypsinisation was stopped by the addition of medium, cells were spun down, washed in PBS and resuspended in 500 &#x000b5;l of sort buffer (1&#x000d7;PBS, 1mM EDTA, 25mM Hepes pH 7.0, 1&#x00025; FCS). Cells were sorted on the basis of their GFP expression level using a FACS VANTAGE SE. Cells in the residual volume of the initial sample were retained and used for controls. The sorted and control cells were washed in PBS and divided in two. Half were used in IF using anti-Oct4 antibodies, and the other half were analysed by RNA FISH. For IF cells were resuspended in 100 &#x000b5;l of 2&#x00025; formaldehyde/PBS. Fixed for 15 min in a tube, cytospun and processed as described above. For RNA FISH, cells were washed in PBS in an eppendorf tube, spun down, resuspended in 100 &#x000b5;l of ice-cold fixative solution (4&#x00025; formaldehyde, 5&#x00025; acetic acid, 0.9&#x00025; NaCl), and incubated on ice for 25 min.
