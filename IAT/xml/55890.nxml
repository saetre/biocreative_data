Previous work demonstrated that an insertional disruption of <italic>RPM2</italic>, which produces the C-terminally truncated protein Rpm2-&#x00394;Cp, supports growth on glucose but cells lose some or all of their mitochondrial genome and become petite. These petites, even if they retain the <italic>RPM1</italic> locus, lose their ability to process the 5&#x02032;-ends of mitochondrial tRNA. We report here that if strains containing the truncated <italic>RPM2</italic> allele are created and maintained on respiratory carbon sources they have wild-type mitochondrial genomes, and a significant portion of tRNA transcripts are processed. In contrast, precursor Rpm1r transcripts accumulate and mature Rpm1r is not made. These data show that one function of the deleted C-terminal region is in the maturation of Rpm1r, and that this region and mature Rpm1r are not absolutely required for RNase P activity. Finally, we demonstrate that full activity can be restored if the N-terminal and C-terminal domains of Rpm2p are supplied <italic>in trans</italic>.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Mitochondrial transfer RNAs (tRNAs) are synthesized as precursors that undergo a number of essential processing steps before assuming a functional role in mitochondrial protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke497c1">1</xref>). Ribonuclease P (RNase P) is the endoribonuclease that generates the mature 5&#x02032;-ends of tRNA by removal of the 5&#x02032;-leaders from precursor-tRNAs in all organisms (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke497c2">2</xref>). All RNase P enzymes described to date, with the exception of plant chloroplast RNase P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke497c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke497c4">4</xref>), are established ribonucleoproteins, composed of at least one RNA and one protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke497c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke497c6">6</xref>). In Eubacteria and a subset of Archea, the RNA component of RNase P is catalytically active <italic>in vitro</italic> in the absence of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke497c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke497c8">8</xref>). In contrast, the RNase P RNAs of the Eukarya are not catalytically active by themselves, and RNase P activity requires both RNA and protein subunits.</p><p> Yeast mitochondrial RNase P is essential for the production of mitochondrially-encoded tRNAs and, thus, is essential for growth on media containing non-fermentable carbon sources. These tRNAs translate a small number of proteins coded by mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) that are necessary for electron transport and oxidative phosphorylation. Mitochondrial protein synthesis is also required for the maintenance of wild-type mtDNA in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke497c9">9</xref>), although the reason for this requirement is not known. Therefore, if cells cannot support mitochondrial tRNA processing, they should not be able to maintain the wild-type mitochondrial genome.</p><p> Subunits of mitochondrial RNase P are encoded in both mitochondrial and nuclear genomes. The RNA subunit of mitochondrial RNase P, Rpm1r, is encoded by mtDNA, whereas the protein subunit, Rpm2p, is encoded in the nuclear genome and imported into mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke497c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke497c11">11</xref>). The gene coding for Rpm1r, <italic>RPM1</italic>, was originally identified by demonstrating that petite deletion mutants could only process tRNAs if they retained mtDNA located between the tRNA<sub>f</sub><sup>Met</sup> and tRNA<sup>Pro</sup> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke497c10">10</xref>). Purification of yeast mitochondrial RNase P to near homogeneity revealed a 105 kDa protein named Rpm2p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke497c12">12</xref>). The evidence that Rpm2p is a subunit of yeast mitochondrial RNase P is compelling. Rpm2p antibodies raised to a Trp&#x02013;Rpm2p fusion protein immunoprecipitate all RNase P activity and all RNase P RNA from mitochondrial extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke497c13">13</xref>). Moreover, an insertional disruption of the <italic>RPM2</italic> gene causes the accumulation of precursor tRNAs <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke497c13">13</xref>). While it is clear that Rpm2p is a subunit of a mitochondrial RNase P enzyme, the role that it plays in enzyme activity is not yet known.</p><p> Further studies revealed that <italic>RPM2</italic> is a complex, multi-functional gene. Experiments designed to delete the entire gene revealed, unexpectedly, that <italic>RPM2</italic> is essential for growth on all carbon sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke497c14">14</xref>). Since mitochondrial protein synthesis is required for respiratory but not fermentative growth, Rpm2p must have at least one other function in addition to its role as a subunit of mitochondrial RNase P. We do not yet know why <italic>RPM2</italic> is essential but cells containing the insertional disruption producing a protein with a C-terminal deletion of 468 amino acids sustain deletions in their mitochondrial DNA and do not process tRNA even if they retain the <italic>RPM1</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke497c14">14</xref>). These results were consistent with a model that placed RNase P function in the C-terminal region of Rpm2p and the essential function in the N-terminal portion of the protein.</p><p> We now report that the C-terminal deletion allele can support RNase P activity if diploid cells with this allele are sporulated and maintained on non-fermentable carbon sources. Therefore, RNase P activity does not, as previously thought, require the C-terminal region of <italic>RPM2</italic>. We show here that the C-terminal deletion allele of <italic>RPM2</italic> differentially affects processing of pre-tRNAs and Rpm1r. The C-terminal deletion mutant allele, <italic>rpm2-734::LEU2</italic>, produces Rpm2-&#x00394;Cp, a protein that does not support Rpm1r processing, but does support pre-tRNA processing, albeit not as efficiently as does Rpm2p. These data show that the two RNA maturation functions of Rpm2p can be separated. Finally, we demonstrate that all functions of Rpm2p are provided if the N-terminal and C-terminal domains, both with mitochondrial targeting signals, are expressed <italic>in</italic><italic>trans</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS </title><sec><title>Strains, media and reagents</title><p>Standard yeast manipulations were used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke497c15">15</xref>).

To determine the effect of the C-terminal deletion in cells grown on non-fermentable media, <italic>RPM2&#x0002f;rpm2-734::LEU2</italic> diploid cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke497f1">1</xref>A) were sporulated, tetrads dissected and spores grown on plates containing glycerol and ethanol as carbon sources. We found that all four spores in each tetrad grew on glycerol&#x0002f;ethanol plates, but two spores formed smaller colonies (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke497f1">1</xref>B). The slower growing cells carry the <italic>rpm2-734::LEU2</italic> allele, whereas cells from larger-sized colonies contained <italic>RPM2</italic>. This result predicts that the mutant protein is properly expressed, localized to mitochondria and provides enough RNase P activity to support slow growth on glycerol. To test this prediction, mitochondrial extracts were prepared from wild-type and mutant cells grown in glycerol&#x0002f;ethanol medium and analyzed by western blotting. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke497f1">1</xref>C shows that both wild-type and mutant <italic>RPM2</italic> alleles produce Rpm2 proteins that are localized to mitochondria. Thus, the deletion introduced into Rpm2p does not affect the stability and localization of the mutant protein.</p><p> One possible explanation for the decreased doubling time is that a percentage of the <italic>rpm2-734::LEU2</italic> cells lose their wild-type mitochondrial genome (become petite) and cannot continue to divide on non-fermentable carbon sources. Such cells should grow if plated to glucose medium but not if plated to glycerol&#x0002f;ethanol medium. Alternatively, the entire population of cells might maintain its wild-type mitochondrial DNA but grow slowly. To differentiate between these two possibilities, the frequency of respiratory deficient cells generated during growth of wild-type and <italic>rpm2-734::LEU2</italic> strains on glycerol&#x0002f;ethanol media was determined. In one approach, we removed aliquots from liquid cultures grown on glycerol&#x0002f;ethanol media and plated an equal number of cells to either glucose or glycerol&#x0002f;ethanol containing plates. In another, after 24 h of growth on glycerol&#x0002f;ethanol plates, colonies were dispersed by micromanipulation and the ability of single cells to multiply on glycerol&#x0002f;ethanol was monitored. Fewer than 3&#x00025; of wild-type and mutant cells failed to divide under conditions that required respiration. Thus, we conclude that <italic>rpm2-734::LEU2 </italic>cells maintain their wild-type mitochondrial DNA and the slow growth phenotype observed on glycerol&#x0002f;ethanol medium cannot be attributed to higher than normal rates of petite formation.</p></sec><sec><title>C-terminal deletion of Rpm2p differentially affects processing of tRNA and Rpm1r</title><p>The tRNA processing capacity of the &#x00394;C mutant grown in glycerol&#x0002f;ethanol liquid medium was assessed by northern analysis. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke497f2">2</xref> demonstrates that while mature tRNAs are produced in the mutant, their steady-state levels are lower compared to wild-type and precursor tRNAs are detected. This occurs regardless of whether they have short (tRNA<sub>f</sub><sup>Met</sup> and tRNA<sup>Phe</sup>, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke497f2">2</xref>A) or long (tRNA<sup>Glu</sup> and tRNA<sup>Pro</sup>, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke497f2">2</xref>B and C, respectively) 5&#x02032;-leader sequences.</p><p> Rpm2p is also required for maturation of the RNA subunit of mitochondrial RNase P, Rpm1r (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke497c21">21</xref>). To analyze the effect of the C-terminal deletion mutation on the synthesis of Rpm1r, steady-state levels of mature Rpm1r and pre-Rpm1r were assessed by northern analysis. The majority of <italic>RPM1</italic> transcripts were mature in wild-type cells with a small amount of an intermediate in the processing pathway detected (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke497f3">3</xref>B, lane 1). In contrast, only a small amount of an intermediate and no mature Rpm1r was detected in the mutant and instead, high molecular weight primary transcripts accumulated (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke497f3">3</xref>B, lane 2). Hybridization of the same filter with a probe complementary to tRNA<sup>Pro</sup> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke497f3">3</xref>C) identified the same major high molecular weight primary transcripts as those detected with the Rpm1r probe (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke497f3">3</xref>B and C, compare lanes 2). There was no comparable transcript detected in wild-type RNA at this exposure (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke497f3">3</xref>C, lane 1). These data suggest that Rpm1r processing is disrupted at both 5&#x02032;- and 3&#x02032;-ends in cells producing Rpm2-&#x00394;Cp.</p></sec><sec><title>Mature Rpm1r 5&#x02032;- and 3&#x02032;-ends are not made in <italic>rpm2-734::LEU2</italic> cells</title><p>The 5&#x02032;-ends of transcripts from <italic>RPM1</italic> were mapped by primer extension. A labeled oligonucleotide complementary to Rpm1r was annealed to wild-type and mutant mitochondrial RNA and extended with reverse transcriptase. The extension products were separated on a 6&#x00025; denaturing polyacrylamide gel and compared to a DNA sequence generated with the same oligonucleotide (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke497f4">4</xref>A). The most abundant termination product in wild-type RNA results from the mature Rpm1r (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke497f4">4</xref>A, lanes 6 and 7). No corresponding extension product was present in the mutant (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke497f4">4</xref>A, lane 8). Transcripts corresponding to Rpm1r precursors have the same 5&#x02032;-ends, previously mapped at the nucleotide level to the SP promoter or to the 3&#x02032;-end of the tRNA<sub>f</sub><sup>Met</sup> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke497c21">21</xref>), in RNA isolated from wild-type and mutant cells.</p><p> To determine if 3&#x02032;-end maturation occurred, a DNA fragment spanning the mature 3&#x02032;-end of Rpm1r was end-labeled, strand-separated, hybridized to mitochondrial RNA from wild-type and mutant cells, and digested with S1 nuclease as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke497c21">21</xref>). The major fragment protected by wild-type RNA corresponds to the mature 3&#x02032;-end of Rpm1r and is labeled 3&#x02032;-end (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke497f4">4</xref>B, lane 3). Its identity was determined by sizing against a chemical sequencing ladder of the same fragment used in the protection experiment (data not shown). No corresponding reaction product was obtained from RNA isolated from the mutant (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke497f4">4</xref>B, lanes 4&#x02013;6). This result demonstrates that the 3&#x02032;-end of mutant Rpm1r is extended relative to the wild-type Rpm1r 3&#x02032;-end. There is a product formed in RNA isolated from both wild-type and mutant cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke497f4">4</xref>B, lanes 3&#x02013;6, Intermediate), that could have arisen from an RNA extended 80 nt downstream of the mature 3&#x02032;-end of Rpm1r (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke497c21">21</xref>).</p><p> These results, together with those identifying the 5&#x02032;-ends (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke497f4">4</xref>A), predict discrete RNAs which were detected, but not separated, in the northern analysis shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke497f3">3</xref>B (lanes 1 and 2). The results reported above indicate that removal of the C-terminus of Rpm2p blocks processing of Rpm1r. Transfer RNA processing is only partially affected. This suggests that the C-terminal domain of Rpm2p plays a more significant role in the processing of Rpm1r than it plays in tRNA processing.</p></sec><sec><title>N- and C-terminal truncated Rpm2 proteins function <italic>in trans</italic></title><p>To determine if the C-terminal domain can act <italic>in trans</italic> to restore full activity of Rpm2-&#x00394;Cp, we used three deletion mutants (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke497f5">5</xref>A).

Only cells that have lost the <italic>URA3</italic> plasmid and have forms of Rpm2p that provide the essential function can grow. <italic>RPM2</italic> and &#x00394;C &#x0002b; &#x00394;N containing cells appeared on 5-FOA plates at the same rate (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke497f5">5</xref>B). However, the combination of &#x00394;C(&#x02013;20) and &#x00394;N&#x000a0;plasmids does not support growth on glucose medium. This indicates that amino acids 715&#x02013;734 are essential for growth. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke497f5">5</xref>C demonstrates that cells expressing &#x00394;C &#x0002b; &#x00394;N fragments <italic>in trans</italic> grow on the non-fermentable carbon sources glycerol&#x0002f;ethanol at a rate similar, but slightly slower, compared to cells expressing an intact, plasmid-encoded Rpm2p. To determine if &#x00394;C and &#x00394;N are maintained <italic>in trans</italic> during these experiments, mitochondrial extracts were prepared and western analysis with anti-Rpm2p antibodies was&#x000a0;performed. Our anti-peptide antibodies do not recognize Rpm2-&#x00394;N protein because the deletion includes the epitope-coding region but it is clear from the phenotype that Rpm2-&#x00394;Np is being produced. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke497f5">5</xref>D shows that Rpm2-&#x00394;C protein from the <italic>in trans</italic> strain and Rpm2-&#x00394;Cp from the original disruption strain migrate identically. There was no full-length Rpm2p, which indicates that Rpm2-&#x00394;C protein is maintained as a separate protein.</p><p> Cells containing both &#x00394;C and &#x00394;N also maintain the ability to be transferred from glucose to glycerol&#x0002f;ethanol media, indicating that these cells keep their wild-type mtDNA independent of growth on a particular carbon source. Indeed, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke497f6">6</xref> shows that the &#x00394;C and &#x00394;N genes together support Rpm1r processing and consequently RNase P activity (lanes 2 and 4 in upper and lower panel, respectively) in both fermentative and respiratory conditions. The amount of mature Rpm1r, however, does appear lower than that found in wild-type cells. Together, the results indicate that the C-terminus harbors a domain that is required for Rpm1r processing and is capable of functioning to a significant degree <italic>in trans</italic>.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Petite deletion mutants result when <italic>rpm2-734::LEU2</italic> cells are grown on glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke497c13">13</xref>) and even though Rpm1r and tRNA genes are retained, the tRNA gene transcripts are not processed. Providing <italic>RPM2</italic> by transformation restores the tRNA processing ability to these petites. We report here that the same <italic>rpm2-734::LEU2 </italic>allele supports mitochondrial tRNA processing and maintenance of wild-type mtDNA if cells are grown on respiratory carbon sources. Therefore, under conditions that require respiration for growth, a truncated version of Rpm2p can support RNase P activity and provide enough tRNA for mitochondrial protein synthesis.</p><p> The observation that <italic>rpm2-734::LEU2</italic> cells grow on respiratory carbon sources clearly demonstrates that the entire <italic>RPM2</italic> open reading frame is not essential for mitochondrial RNase P activity. Nevertheless, the ratio of precursor to mature mitochondrial tRNA is greater in these cells relative to wild-type, indicating that removal of the C-terminus of Rpm2p has a negative effect on RNase P activity. This effect may not, however, be a direct effect of the truncation on RNase P activity but instead may be related to the role of Rpm2p in the maturation of Rpm1r, the RNA subunit of mitochondrial RNase P.</p><p> In <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, Rpm1r is made as a part of a polycistronic transcript, tRNA<sub>f</sub><sup>Met</sup>&#x02013;Rpm1r&#x02013;tRNA<sup>Pro</sup>, that undergoes a series of processing steps to release mature Rpm1r (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke497c23">23</xref>). Previous results have shown that neither 5&#x02032;- nor 3&#x02032;-ends of Rpm1r are matured when <italic>rpm2-734::LEU2</italic> cells are grown on glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke497c21">21</xref>). Interestingly, the results shown here demonstrate that even though <italic>rpm2-734::LEU2</italic> cells grown on non-fermentable carbon sources are capable of processing mitochondrial tRNAs, Rpm1r processing is blocked. Thus, the C-terminal region of Rpm2p plays a more significant role in Rpm1r processing than tRNA processing. Moreover, the role of the C-terminal region in Rpm1r processing can be provided <italic>in trans</italic> suggesting that it may be a relatively autonomous domain. Together, these results indicate that the primary defect in <italic>rpm2-734::LEU2</italic> cells is in the processing of Rpm1r, and defects in tRNA processing may be linked to the absence of mature Rpm1r.</p><p> Rpm1r is necessary for mitochondrial RNase P activity both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke497c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke497c20">20</xref>). Therefore, in the absence of detectable mature Rpm1r, it is surprising to find mature tRNAs in <italic>rpm2-734::LEU2</italic> mitochondria. This observation suggests that pre-Rpm1r may be capable of functioning as a component of RNase P. If this is the case, pre-Rpm1r is not as efficient as mature Rpm1r in supporting tRNA processing since tRNA precursors accumulate. In this context, it has been shown that bacterial RNase P RNA precursors function in tRNA processing <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke497c24">24</xref>). Alternatively, levels of mature Rpm1r below our detection limit may be supporting RNase P activity in <italic>rpm2-734::LEU2</italic> cells grown on non-fermentable carbon sources.</p><p> The mechanism by which Rpm2p influences Rpm1r processing is unknown. There are several scenarios that could lead to the accumulation of Rpm1r precursors with both 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; extensions. First of all, the RNase P activity <italic>per se</italic> could be required for maturation of one, or both, ends of Rpm1r. In this context, addition of the <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> RNase P protein to a precursor form of the P RNA <italic>in vitro</italic> results in autolytic processing of the 5&#x02032;- and 3&#x02032;-ends of the precursor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke497c25">25</xref>). Another possibility is that one or more additional nuclease activities necessary for Rpm1r maturation are encoded by <italic>RPM2</italic> and function independently of RNase P. Finally, Rpm2p could play a chaperone role, facilitating Rpm1r folding into a conformation recognized by 5&#x02032;- and 3&#x02032;-end processing enzymes.</p><p> It is clear that growth conditions have a profound effect on the ability of the C-terminally truncated form of Rpm2p to provide RNase P activity in mitochondria. One possibility is that there is more enzyme produced in respiring cells and an increase in amount could compensate for reduced activity caused by the truncation. Indeed, increased expression of nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins, as well as expression of genes encoded in mtDNA, does accompany growth on glycerol&#x0002f;ethanol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke497c26">26</xref>). Similarly, expression of genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis are repressed by glucose (catabolite repression) and this decrease coupled with the truncation could cause RNase P activity to fall below the threshold required for mitochondrial protein synthesis necessary to maintain a wild-type mitochondrial genome. Cells with deletions of <italic>ABF2</italic> and <italic>MMF1</italic>, two other yeast genes encoding mitochondrial proteins, also maintain their wild-type mitochondrial genome if grown by respiration but lose it when grown by fermentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke497c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke497c28">28</xref>).</p><p> While <italic>rpm2-734::LEU2</italic> cells are capable of growth on non-fermentable carbon sources, their growth is slow. This reduction in growth rate could be a consequence of inefficient tRNA processing linked to truncated Rpm2p and&#x0002f;or inefficient Rpm1r processing. However, Cliften <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke497c29">29</xref>) showed that there is normal respiratory growth if only 10&#x02013;20&#x00025; of wild-type mitochondrial transcripts are present. Clearly, at least 20&#x00025; of tRNAs are processed in <italic>rpm2-734::LEU2</italic> mitochondria suggesting that tRNA maturation may not be limiting for growth on respiratory carbon sources. Therefore, it is possible that the slow respiratory growth of <italic>rpm2-734::LEU2</italic> might be a reflection of some other mitochondrial dysfunction. In this regard, we have recently demonstrated that Rpm2p, apart from its role in RNase P, has an additional function in the synthesis of mitochondrially-encoded subunits of cytochrome <italic>c</italic> oxidase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke497c30">30</xref>). This function is also required for respiratory growth and may also be affected by the Rpm2p truncation.</p><p> An approach to understand why cells expressing the same Rpm2-&#x00394;C protein display differences in their ability to maintain tRNA processing on different carbon sources would be to search for suppressors that allow maintenance of a wild-type mtDNA under fermentative growth. Preliminary results with this approach show promise and will be reported elsewhere.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gke497f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> The <italic>rpm2-734::LEU2</italic> allele supports respiratory growth if spores are grown directly on medium with glycerol&#x0002f;ethanol.
