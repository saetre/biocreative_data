Ionomics is a developing functional genomic strategy designed to rapidly identify the genes and gene networks involved in regulating how plants acquire and accumulate these mineral nutrients from the soil. Here, we report on the coupling of high-throughput elemental profiling of shoot tissue from various <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> accessions with DNA microarray-based bulk segregant analysis and reverse genetics, for the rapid identification of genes from wild populations of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> that are involved in regulating how plants acquire and accumulate Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> from the soil. Elemental profiling of shoot tissue from 12 different <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> accessions revealed that two coastal populations of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> collected from Tossa del Mar, Spain, and Tsu, Japan (Ts-1 and Tsu-1, respectively), accumulate higher shoot levels of Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> than do Col-0 and other accessions. We identify At<italic>HKT1,</italic> known to encode a Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> transporter, as being the causal locus driving elevated shoot Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> in both Ts-1 and Tsu-1. Furthermore, we establish that a deletion in a tandem repeat sequence approximately 5 kb upstream of At<italic>HKT1</italic> is responsible for the reduced root expression of <italic>AtHKT1</italic> observed in these accessions. Reciprocal grafting experiments establish that this loss of At<italic>HKT1</italic> expression in roots is responsible for elevated shoot Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>. Interestingly, and in contrast to the <italic>hkt1&#x02013;1</italic> null mutant, under NaCl stress conditions, this novel At<italic>HKT1</italic> allele not only does not confer NaCl sensitivity but also cosegregates with elevated NaCl tolerance. We also present all our elemental profiling data in a new open access ionomics database, the Purdue Ionomics Information Management System (PiiMS; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.purdue.edu/dp/ionomics">http://www.purdue.edu/dp/ionomics</ext-link>). Using DNA microarray-based genotyping has allowed us to rapidly identify At<italic>HKT1</italic> as the casual locus driving the natural variation in shoot Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> accumulation we observed in Ts-1 and Tsu-1. Such an approach overcomes the limitations imposed by a lack of established genetic markers in most <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> accessions and opens up a vast and tractable source of natural variation for the identification of gene function not only in ionomics but also in many other biological processes.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="synopsis"><title>Synopsis</title><p>Unlike most animals, plants are sessile and cannot leave a poor-quality environment after germinating.

This makes plants an ideal system for the study of adaptive variation, and this is particularly true of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis),</italic> which shows substantial natural variation and for which numerous genetic tools exist. Using a combination of analytical chemistry, genetics, and genomics, the authors were able to identify the specific genetic alteration that drive the natural variation in shoot sodium (Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>) accumulation capacity observed in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> populations from coastal regions of Spain and Japan (Tossa del Mar and Tsu, respectively). They observed that a deletion in the DNA responsible for regulating the expression of <italic>HKT1</italic>, a gene known to encode for a Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> transporter, causes reduced expression of At<italic>HKT1</italic> in roots of both the Spanish and Japanese populations. Such altered expression results in the elevated shoot Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> observed in these two populations.

Such natural variation has the advantage over induced mutations in that uncovering the adaptive significance of such variation provides tools for the integration of gene function in the context of whole plant physiology. However, this genetic resource is still underexploited, mainly because natural phenotypic variation is usually the result of genotypic variation at multiple loci. Even when dealing with monogenic traits, it is a major challenge to identify a particular gene controlling a phenotype of interest. Currently, fewer than ten genes have been identified in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> using the natural variation approach &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020210-b007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020210-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;, whereas variation in multiple traits such as floral and meristem development, resistance, and defense against pathogens as well as metabolic enzymes (&#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020210-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d; and references therein) have been documented. Genetic differences between local populations are presumably associated with adaptation to the prevailing environmental conditions, although well-established examples of this in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> are limited. Such investigations are impeded by the fact that very little information exists about the environmental conditions and habitat of the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> accessions that have been collected and are curated at the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> Biological Resource Center.

Such an approach using DNA microarray-based genotyping overcomes the time constraints imposed on using natural variation by the rapid identification of genetic markers, and opens up a vast and tractable source of natural variation for the identification of gene function not only in ionomics but also in many other biological processes.

This novel At<italic>HKT1</italic> allele, in both Ts-1 and Tsu-1, is responsible for the higher shoot Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> accumulation observed in these accessions compared with the reference accession Col-0, when grown under background NaCl levels.

All these studies are consistent with the current model that HKT1 functions to tightly regulate Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> accumulation in shoots by unloading Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> from the xylem in both roots and shoots and recycling Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> to the roots via the phloem.</p><p>Results reported here confirm that this new naturally evolved At<italic>HKT1</italic> allele is responsible for the elevated shoot Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> accumulation we observe in Ts-1 and Tsu-1, via the specific downregulation of At<italic>HKT1</italic> expression in roots. Reciprocal grafting also confirms that the primary site for HKT1 function in regulating shoot Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> is in the root, with HKT1 playing little role in the shoot.

Interestingly, and contrarily to the loss-of-function mutants <italic>hkt1,</italic> this novel allele appears to also be associated with enhanced NaCl tolerance.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ts-1 and Tsu-1 Accumulate Higher Levels of Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> in the Shoot than Col-0</title><p>Elemental profiling of shoot tissue collected from 12 different <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> accessions, including Col-0, Cvi-0, Est-1, Kas-2, Mrk-0, Mt-0, Se-0, Ts-1, Van-0, Nd-1, Tsu-1, and L<italic>er</italic>-2, revealed that Ts-1 and Tsu-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020210-g001">Figure 1</xref>A) accumulate higher levels of Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> than Col-0 and all other accessions tested when propagated in soil with low levels of NaCl under controlled growth conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020210-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). Interestingly, the Ts-1 and Tsu-1 accessions were collected from the coastal regions of Spain (Tossa del Mar) and Japan (Tsu), respectively. Besides being annotated as having different geographical origins, Ts-1 and Tsu-1 have different physical appearances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020210-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). Moreover, based on a genome-scale DNA polymorphism analysis involving 96 <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> accessions, these two accessions appeared to be genetically distinct &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020210-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;. The Ts-1 and Tsu-1 accessions can also be distinguished based on the fact that Ts-1 accumulates elevated concentrations of cobalt (&#x0002b;55&#x00025;) in shoot tissue compared to Col-0, while Tsu-1 has lower levels of Co. A complete set of the elemental profiling data summarized here can be obtained at the open access Purdue Ionomics Information Management System (PiiMS) at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.purdue.edu/dp/ionomics">http://www.purdue.edu/dp/ionomics</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Genetic Analysis and Mapping of the High Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> Trait</title><p>To determine the feasibility of using natural variation to identify individual loci regulating ionomic variation, we attempted to map the locus responsible for elevated Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> in Ts-1 and Tsu-1. Both accessions were crossed to Col-0, and the shoot concentrations of Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> were measured in the F1 hybrid plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020210-g001">Figure 1</xref>C). The concentration of Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> was not significantly different from Col-0, suggesting that the loci controlling Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> accumulation in Ts-1 and Tsu-1 are recessive in both cases. Analysis of the segregating F2 plants from either cross revealed a pattern consistent with 3:1 segregation ratio of Col-0 &#x000d7; Ts-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020210-g002">Figure 2</xref>A) and Col-0 &#x000d7; Tsu-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020210-g002">Figure 2</xref>B) for shoot Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> concentrations. Therefore, we conclude that the high Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> phenotype observed in both Ts-1 and Tsu-1 segregates as a monogenic recessive trait. We further used the complementation test to demonstrate that the loci driving elevated shoot Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> in Ts-1 and Tsu-1 are allelic to each other, showing that the F1 plants from Tsu-1 &#x000d7; Ts-1 have shoot Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> levels that are similar to each parent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020210-g001">Figure 1</xref>D).

From the Ts-1 &#x000d7; Col-0 F2 population represented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020210-g002">Figure 2</xref>A, two pools of DNA were prepared, one containing genomic DNA from 30 plants with Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> levels similar to Col-0, constituting the &#x0201c;control&#x0201d; pool, and another with DNA from 30 plants with the highest Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> levels, similar to those of the Ts-1 parent, constituting the &#x0201c;high Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>&#x0201d; pool. Single feature polymorphisms (SFPs) were identified for Col-0 and Ts-1 by comparing the hybridization of genomic DNA isolated from the parental Col-0 and Ts-1 accessions to the Affymetrix <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> ATH1 microarrays. The frequency of these SFPs in the DNA from the pool of F2 progeny plants with high Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> levels, and in the pool with control Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> levels, was scored by hybridization of genomic DNA to ATH1 microarrays. The DNA microarray-based BSA revealed a strong peak and therefore enrichment in Ts-1 SFPs linked to the locus causing elevated shoot Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> in Ts-1 at 6.6 Mbp on Chromosome IV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020210-g002">Figure 2</xref>C). Similarly, a strong peak at 6.4 Mbp in Chromosome IV was obtained when the hybridization was performed using DNA pools from the Tsu-1 &#x000d7; Col-0 F2 population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020210-g002">Figure 2</xref>C). Approximately 513 genes (corresponding to 23 BAC clones) are contained within the confidence interval of 5.525 to 7.475 Mbp on Chromosome IV.

When grown under the same conditions, the Ts-1 and Tsu-1 accessions also show increased Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> accumulation compared to Col-0 in leaves at all stages of development.

Several polymorphisms were identified both in the coding region and in the upstream and downstream regions of the At<italic>HKT1</italic> gene. In the coding region, no nonsense mutation was recognized and 19 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified in both Ts-1 and Tsu-1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020210-sg002">Figure S2</xref>A), seven of which result in the amino acid changes R3I, K10N, V66L, C134Y, E385G, V453L, and F477L.

The most upstream polymorphism affects two repeated units of 681 and 673 bp, linked by a 34-bp sequence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020210-sg002">Figure S2</xref>B). These two repeated units are localized 5,320 to 3,933 bp upstream of the At<italic>HKT1</italic> start codon and are 97&#x00025; identical to each other in Col-0. In Ts-1 and Tsu-1, we identified a 725- and 687-bp deletion, respectively, which removes the end of the first of these repeated units, the beginning of the second unit, and the 34-bp junction sequence. Consequently, only one of the repeated units is present in Ts-1 and Tsu-1. The second major polymorphism identified in this region, about 3,100 bp upstream of the start codon, is an insertion of 13 bp in the sequence of Ts-1 as well as Tsu-1, resulting in the duplication of a 10-bp sequence (AATGTGTTAT) in Ts-1 and Tsu-1 that is present only once in Col-0. Similarly, 1,210 bp upstream of the start codon, a 14-bp insertion results in a duplicated 10-bp sequence (TCATTGCAAA) in Ts-1 and Tsu-1.

Under high NaCl concentrations (50 and 100 mM NaCl), both Ts-1 and Tsu-1 have higher levels of Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> in the shoot compared to Col-0, in all leaves at different stages of development, including the youngest ones not fully developed and localized close to the meristem (stage 1; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020210-sg001">Figure S1</xref>B and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020210-sg001">S1</xref>C). However, this elevated shoot Na does not cause increased NaCl sensitivity in Tsu-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020210-g007">Figure 7</xref>A). Given the connection between At<italic>HKT1</italic> expression and NaCl sensitivity, we decided to evaluate the involvement of this novel allele of At<italic>HKT1</italic> in NaCl tolerance by screening F2 plants from a cross between Tsu-1 &#x000d7; Col-0 for their capacity to survive high levels of NaCl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020210-g007">Figure 7</xref>).

Therefore, although this new At<italic>HKT1</italic> allele contributes to an increased Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> accumulation in the shoot, it does not confer NaCl sensitivity but, on the contrary, appears to co-segregate with enhanced NaCl tolerance. Although currently we cannot eliminate the possibility that a second unknown gene is conferring the enhanced NaCl tolerance observed in Tsu-1, and due to a small genetic distance between At<italic>HKT1</italic> and this second gene they segregate together in the F2 population studied.

Such changes in expression levels are likely to be responsible for the accumulation of Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> in the shoots of Ts-1 and Tsu-1.</p><p>Previously, a suppressor of the NaCl sensitivity of <italic>sos3&#x02013;1</italic> (Col-0 <italic>gl1</italic>) called Line 1425 (A.

Based on our sequence analysis and previous promoter-GUS reporter gene analysis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020210-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d;, this tandem repeat region is well upstream of the promoter of At<italic>HKT1</italic>.

However, confirmation of this model requires further experimentation.</p><p>The availability of the natural variant of At<italic>HKT1</italic> in Ts-1 and Tsu-1, in which At<italic>HKT1</italic> expression is altered specifically in roots, supports a model for HKT1 function in which the transporter plays a role in controlling Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> accumulation in shoots by regulating, at the root level, the transport of Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> in the xylem transpiration stream to the shoot. We propose that lower expression of At<italic>HKT1</italic> in the roots results in reduced Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> retrieval from the root xylem, leading to the elevated Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> observed in Ts-1 and Tsu-1 shoots.

Such cosegregation of the Tsu-1 At<italic>HKT1</italic> allele with increased NaCl tolerance is consistent with this new allele of At<italic>HKT1</italic> being involved in the elevated tolerate to NaCl observed in Tsu-1.

Four samples (indicated as Nos. 1, 2, 3, and 4 in the graph) were harvested per plant, with No. 1 containing leaves Nos. 4 and 5 and therefore being the youngest leaves, No. 2 containing leaf No. 8, No. 3 containing leaf No. 11, and No. 4 containing leaf No. 14 and being the oldest.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Tissue Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> quantification.</title><p>Approximately 3 mg of dry weight of each plant was sampled into Pyrex tubes (16 &#x000d7; 100 mm) after drying at 92 &#x000b0;C for 20 h. After cooling, seven of approximately 100 samples from each sample set were weighed. All samples were digested with 0.7 ml of concentrated nitric acid (OmniTrace; VWR Scientific Products; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.vwr.com">http://www.vwr.com</ext-link>) and diluted to 6.0 ml with 18 M&#x003a9; water.

All samples were normalized to calculated weights, as determined with an iterative algorithm using the best-measured elements, the weights of the seven weighed samples, and the solution concentrations, implemented in Microsoft Excel (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.microsoft.com">http://www.microsoft.com</ext-link>) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020210-b001">1</xref>&#x0005d;.</p></sec><sec id="s4f"><title>DNA microarray-based BSA.</title><p>DNA microarray-based BSA was realized as previously described &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020210-b012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020210-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;. Briefly, SFPs were identified between Col-0 and Ts-1 and Tsu-1 by hybridizing labeled DNA from each one of the accessions to Affymetrix ATH1 microarrays and comparing them to Col-0 hybridizations downloaded from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.naturalvariation.org/xam">http://www.naturalvariation.org/xam</ext-link>. Two genomic DNA pools from an F2 population of a cross between Ts-1 or Tsu-1 and Col-0 were created and hybridized to arrays. Each one of the pools contained plants with either levels of Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> similar to Col-0 (&#x0201c;control&#x0201d; pool) or high Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> levels similar to Ts-1 or Tsu-1 (&#x0201c;high Na<sup>&#x0002b;&#x0201d;</sup> pool). At loci unlinked to the ionomic phenotype of interest, the pools should have equivalent amounts of each genotype, and the hybridization signal at each SFP should be intermediate between the two parent accessions, for an average difference between the two DNA microarrays of zero. At linked loci, the difference between the two DNA microarrays should be approximately two-thirds the difference between the parent accessions. By smoothing the signal across multiple SFPs, the noise is reduced and the peak of the differences in hybridization signal will correspond to the chromosomal region of the loci controlling the mapped trait. Raw hybridization data (.CEL files) for each probe on the ATH1 DNA microarrays used in these experiments have been submitted to both Natrualvariation.org (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.naturalvariation.org">http://www.naturalvariation.org</ext-link>) and Gene Expression Omnibus (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo</ext-link>) for public distribution.</p></sec><sec id="s4g"><title>Sequencing of the At<italic>HKT1</italic> allele from Ts-1 and Tsu-1.</title><p>To sequence the At<italic>HKT1</italic> gene and corresponding promoter from Ts-1 (CS1552) and Tsu-1 (CS1640), synthetic oligonucleotide primers were designed to produce overlapping amplified PCR products from 5,456 bp upstream of the At<italic>HKT1</italic> start codon to 386 bp downstream of the At<italic>HKT1</italic> stop codon, corresponding to positions 32,115 and 41,615, respectively of the BAC clone F24G24 in Chromosome IV.</p><p><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020210-st001">Table S1</xref> provides a summary of the pairs of primers used and the size of the PCR products expected for Col-0 (based on published sequence) and obtained for Ts-1 and Tsu-1.
