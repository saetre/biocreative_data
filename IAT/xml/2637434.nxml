However, neither the mechanism of toxicity by PrP<sup>Sc</sup>, nor the normal function of PrP<sup>C</sup> is entirely clear. Recent reports suggest that imbalance of iron homeostasis is a common feature of prion infected cells and mouse models, implicating redox-iron in prion disease pathogenesis. In this report, we provide evidence that PrP<sup>C</sup> mediates cellular iron uptake and transport, and mutant PrP forms alter cellular iron levels differentially. Using human neuroblastoma cells as models, we demonstrate that over-expression of PrP<sup>C</sup> increases intra-cellular iron relative to non-transfected controls as indicated by an increase in total cellular iron, the cellular labile iron pool (LIP), and iron content of ferritin. As a result, the levels of iron uptake proteins transferrin (Tf) and transferrin receptor (TfR) are decreased, and expression of iron storage protein ferritin is increased. The positive effect of PrP<sup>C</sup> on ferritin iron content is enhanced by stimulating PrP<sup>C</sup> endocytosis, and reversed by cross-linking PrP<sup>C</sup> on the plasma membrane. Expression of mutant PrP forms lacking the octapeptide-repeats, the membrane anchor, or carrying the pathogenic mutation PrP<sup>102L</sup> decreases ferritin iron content significantly relative to PrP<sup>C</sup> expressing cells, but the effect on cellular LIP and levels of Tf, TfR, and ferritin is complex, varying with the mutation. Neither PrP<sup>C</sup> nor the mutant PrP forms influence the rate or amount of iron released into the medium, suggesting a functional role for PrP<sup>C</sup> in cellular iron uptake and transport to ferritin, and dysfunction of PrP<sup>C</sup> as a significant contributing factor of brain iron imbalance in prion disorders.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="16"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Prion protein (PrP<sup>C</sup>) is an evolutionarily conserved cell surface glycoprotein expressed abundantly on neuronal cells. Despite its ubiquitous presence, the physiological function of PrP<sup>C</sup> has remained ambiguous. The best characterized role for this protein remains its involvement in the pathogenesis of familial, infectious, and sporadic prion disorders, where a change in the conformation of PrP<sup>C</sup> from a mainly &#x003b1;-helical to a &#x003b2;-sheet rich PrP-scrapie (PrP<sup>Sc</sup>) form renders it infectious and pathogenic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004468-Caughey1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004468-Deleault1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. The mechanism by which PrP<sup>Sc</sup> induces neurotoxicity, however, is not clear. Studies over the past decade have clarified several aspects of this process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004468-Caughey1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004468-Aguzzi2">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004468-Harris1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Prominent among these is the resistance of transgenic mice lacking neuronal PrP<sup>C</sup> expression to PrP<sup>Sc</sup> induced toxicity, implicating PrP<sup>C</sup> as the principal mediator of the neurotoxic signal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004468-Mallucci1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004468-Chesebro1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. However, prion infected transgenic mice expressing PrP<sup>C</sup> only on astrocytes accumulate PrP<sup>Sc</sup> and succumb to disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004468-Jeffrey1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, leaving the matter unresolved. Adding to the complexity is the development of prion specific neuropathology in mice over-expressing normal or mutant PrP in the wrong cellular compartment in the absence of detectable PrP<sup>Sc</sup>, suggesting the presence of additional pathways of neurotoxicity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004468-Caughey1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004468-Harris1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Although brain homogenates from these animals are not infectious in bioassays, these models suggest that a disproportionate change in the physiological function of PrP<sup>C</sup> is as neurotoxic as the gain of toxic function by PrP<sup>Sc</sup>. Investigations on both fronts are therefore essential to uncover the underlying mechanism(s) of neurotoxicity in these disorders.</p><p>Efforts aimed at understanding the physiological function of PrP<sup>C</sup> and pathological implications thereof have revealed several possibilities, varying with the model, the physiological state, and the extra- and intracellular milieu in a particular tissue. Some of the reported functions include a role in cell adhesion, signal transduction, and as an anti-oxidant and anti-apoptotic protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004468-Harris1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004468-Roucou1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004468-Westergard1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. While the importance of these observations cannot be under-estimated, they fail to provide a direct link between PrP<sup>C</sup> function and dysfunction to prion disease pathogenesis. In this context, it is interesting to note that PrP<sup>C</sup> binds iron and copper, and is believed to play a functional role in neuronal iron and copper metabolism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004468-Brown1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004468-Pauly1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Since both iron and copper are highly redox-active and neurotoxic if mis-managed, it is conceivable that dysfunction of PrP<sup>C</sup> due to aggregation to the PrP<sup>Sc</sup> form causes the reported accumulation of redox-active PrP<sup>Sc</sup> complexes in prion infected cell and mouse models, inducing a state of iron imbalance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004468-Kim1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004468-Basu1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>.

Using a combination of neuroblastoma cell lines expressing normal and mutant PrP forms, we demonstrate that over-expression of PrP<sup>C</sup> increases intracellular LIP and the amount of iron deposited in ferritin. Pathogenic and non-pathogenic mutations of PrP over-expressed to the same extent as PrP<sup>C</sup> alter cellular LIP and ferritin iron content differentially, specific to the mutation. Certain cell lines, especially cells expressing anchorless PrP<sup>231stop</sup>, demonstrate increased LIP in the presence of decreased ferritin iron, while PrP<sup>102L</sup>-cells display low LIP in the presence of adequate ferritin iron. Furthermore, stimulation of endocytosis by PrP specific antibody increases ferritin iron, while cross-linking at the plasma membrane increases LIP but has minimal effect on ferritin iron, indicating that alteration of PrP function or cellular localization disturbs the homeostasis between ferritin iron and cellular LIP. The differential incorporation of iron by mutant cell lines is maintained in the presence of excess extra-cellular iron, demonstrating a dominant role of PrP<sup>C</sup> in iron uptake and transport. The positive effect of PrP<sup>C</sup> on cellular iron is mainly due to enhanced uptake since the amount released into the culture medium is not altered in any of the cell lines tested. Together, these observations suggest a role for PrP<sup>C</sup> in mediating iron uptake and transport to ferritin directly, or by interacting with other iron modulating proteins. Below we discuss these data with reference to possible functions of PrP<sup>C</sup> in cellular iron metabolism, and the implications thereof in inducing imbalance in iron homeostasis observed in prion disease affected brains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004468-Kim1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004468-Hur1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004468-Singh1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>It is surprising that a GPI-linked protein such as PrP<sup>C</sup> is involved in iron transport to ferritin since PrP<sup>C</sup> is a membrane protein that undergoes vesicular transport while ferritin is cytosolic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004468-Liu1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. Normally, cellular iron uptake is mediated by the Tf/TfR dependent and independent pathways, the former being most prominent and well characterized especially in neuroblastoma cells. In the Tf/TfR dependent pathway, ferric iron captured by Tf is taken up by the cells through TfR-mediated uptake <italic>via</italic> clathrin coated pits. Tf-bound ferric iron is released in the acidic environment of the endosomes, reduced to ferrous iron by an endosomal ferric reductase Steap3, and transported across the endosomal membrane by DMT1 to cytosolic ferritin where it is oxidized to the fairly inert ferric form by ferritin H-chain and stored <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004468-Moos1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004468-MacKenzie1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004468-Liu1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. In the Tf-independent pathway, iron is taken up by an unknown transport mechanism, possibly non-specifically by fluid phase of endocytosis, and stored in ferritin. Ferritin regulates the biologically available LIP in the cell, and is itself regulated by iron regulatory proteins (IRPs) 1 and 2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004468-Moos1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004468-MacKenzie1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004468-Ohgami1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004468-Burdo1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>.

Where might PrP intersect with this tightly orchestrated mechanism of iron uptake, transport, and storage? Three potential mechanisms are plausible: 1) modulation of uptake at the plasma membrane independently or by interacting with the Tf/TfR dependent pathway, 2) facilitation of iron transport to cytosolic ferritin across the endosomal membrane by promoting ferric iron release from Tf and/or its reduction for transfer through DMT1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004468-MacKenzie1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, or 3) assistance in deposition into ferritin by oxidizing ferrous iron to the ferric form. It is unlikely that PrP facilitates export of iron from neuroblastoma cells based on our observations.</p><p>At the plasma membrane, PrP<sup>C</sup> could take up iron directly from the extra-cellular milieu and deliver to an endosomal compartment as suggested for copper <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004468-Brown2">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>.

It remains plausible, though, that PrP<sup>C</sup> modulates iron uptake by the Tf/TfR pathway at the plasma membrane or in an endosomal compartment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004468-Miura1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>It is also possible that extracellular iron induces the movement of PrP<sup>C</sup> from detergent insoluble membrane domains where it normally resides to the proximity of TfR in a similar manner as in the presence of copper <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004468-Brown2">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. Here, it may enhance the binding of iron loaded Tf to its receptor, or stimulate the endocytosis of Tf/TfR complex by a direct or an indirect interaction.

Assuming this scenario, the increase in TfR levels by stimulation of PrP endocytosis by 3F4 and the differential effect of mutant PrP forms on ferritin iron content may be explained by a change in the rate of endocytosis, or altered interaction of normal and mutant PrP forms with Tf or TfR due to misfolding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004468-Miura1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004468-Peters1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>.

Though attractive, this model fails to explain decreased ferritin iron in the presence of significantly high LIP in cells expressing anchorless PrP<sup>231stop</sup> and by cross-linking PrP at the plasma membrane, indicating a role downstream from the plasma membrane. The up-regulation of PrP<sup>C</sup> at the transcriptional and translational level when cells are exposed to excess extra-cellular iron (supporting information) perhaps reflects its function as an iron regulatory protein, though a protective response to oxidative stress cannot be ruled out under these experimental conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004468-Choi1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>.

However, decreased ferritin iron despite high LIP levels in cells expressing anchor-less PrP and the opposite scenario in PrP<sup>102L</sup>-cells suggests an additional role in iron transport between the LIP and cellular ferritin, a function that is hard to explain merely by the altered reductase activity of mutant proteins. Although we could not detect measurable ferroxidase activity of recombinant PrP, such a function of cell associated PrP<sup>C</sup> would explain the facilitative effect of PrP<sup>C</sup> on iron incorporation into ferritin. Further studies are required to resolve this question.</p><p>Despite obvious shortcomings in our data in explaining the mechanistic details of cellular iron modulation by PrP, this report clearly shows the effect of PrP and its mutants on iron uptake and transport.

Each sample contained either 1 &#x000b5;l of water or 1 &#x000b5;l of 300 &#x000b5;M CuSO<sub>4</sub>, 6 &#x000b5;L of the sample (undiluted human plasma, human serum albumin 70 g/l (Sigma A1653-5G) in PBS or recombinant prion protein (0.6 &#x000b5;g/ml) and 820 &#x000b5;l of reagent A. Multichannel pipette (Finnpipette) was used for the rapid addition of the reagent B (substrate) to minimize the time difference in sample processing. Sample quadruplicates were incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for 4 min. Unoxidized Fe<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> was reacted with 60 &#x000b5;l of chromogen solution (reagent C) and absorbance was measured at 600 nm with Smart Spec Plus (BioRad) spectrophotometer. Copper was added to provide two copper ions per PrP molecule, and was also added to human albumin and plasma samples. The amount of PrP protein in PrP-containing samples (3.6 &#x000b5;g/sample) roughly corresponds to a known amount of ceruloplasmin in 6 &#x000b5;l of undiluted human plasma. As a control, purified 99&#x00025; human serum albumin was used (70 g/l in PBS) to mimic the total protein concentration in plasma.
