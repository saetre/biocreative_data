Model organisms have assisted in the identification of novel neuromuscular disease genes and genetic pathways (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP304C1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP304C3">3</xref>). We have exploited mouse mutagenesis to identify new neuromuscular mutants. In phenotype-driven screens of mutagenized mice, simple measures of muscle strength such as wheel running or grip strength have failed to consistently identify mutants that show muscular defects at the histological level. In addition, measuring progressive motor neuron loss in mutagenized animals is not a suitable protocol for large-scale screening programmes. In contrast, overt phenotypes such as muscle atrophy, tremors, gait defects and growth retardation have been used to signpost abnormal neuromuscular function in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP304C4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP304C5">5</xref>). Using this simple paradigm, we identified <italic>ostes</italic> in an <italic>N-</italic>ethyl <italic>N-</italic>nitrosourea (ENU) screen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP304C6">6</xref>). The aim of this work was to characterize this novel neuromuscular phenotype in the mouse and to provide insights into the underlying molecular mechanism. We present evidence that the product of the genetically linked <italic>Pkd1l2</italic> (polycystic kidney disease gene 1-like 2) gene is grossly overexpressed in <italic>ostes</italic>/<italic>ostes</italic> mice, and that ectopic expression of PKD1L2 in transgenic mice leads to similar neuromuscular features. To date, no analysis of PKD1L2 protein expression, localization or <italic>in vivo</italic> function has been done. Here, we show that PKD1L2 is the first transient receptor potential polycystic (TRPP) channel to be associated with neuromuscular function and disease. Additionally, we show that abnormal lipid metabolism in PKD1L2-dysregulated mice is a key feature of this disease.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2a"><title><italic>Ostes</italic> mice show a complex neuromuscular phenotype</title><p>We assessed the neuromuscular system in <italic>ostes</italic>/<italic>ostes</italic> mice at three levels of analysis. Grossly, <italic>ostes</italic>/<italic>ostes</italic> mice become recognizable by their small size and reduced weight between 3 and 5 weeks of age (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP304F1">1</xref>A) and remain small and light throughout life (see weights of 12-week-old mice, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP304F1">1</xref>B). <italic>Ostes</italic>/<italic>ostes</italic> mice also show a moderate tremor of the hind limbs upon suspension by the tail and have a poor reaching response. Conversely, <italic>ostes</italic>/+ mice do not display any overt abnormal phenotype. Sections of 24 <italic>ostes</italic>/<italic>ostes</italic> tissues including heart did not reveal any pathology except for muscle at this level of examination (data not shown). Haematoxylin and eosin (H&#x00026;E)-stained sections of hind limb muscles from <italic>ostes</italic>/<italic>ostes</italic> mice show striking fibre size asymmetry, including large compensatory fibres with internal nuclei (representative pictures and quantifications in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP304F1">1</xref>C, D and E). In addition, clusters of fibres with pyknotic nuclei and scattered, small centrally nucleated fibres are present, indicating fibre atrophy and some regeneration, respectively (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP304F1">1</xref>C and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ddp304/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S1</ext-link>).

Therefore, endplates, axons and presynaptic axon terminals in lumbrical muscle wholemounts from 45-day-old <italic>ostes</italic>/<italic>ostes</italic>, <italic>ostes</italic>/+ and wild-type mice were immunostained and examined for signs of denervation. Confocal microscopy revealed many denervated endplates in <italic>ostes</italic>/<italic>ostes</italic> muscles, characteristically showing a plaque-like morphology, with or without contact to a visible degenerating nerve terminal, or only partially occupied by a small number of nerve terminal boutons (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP304F1">1</xref>F). Additionally, &#x0223c;40% of <italic>ostes</italic>/<italic>ostes</italic> motor endplates were polyneuronally innervated by collateral branches of two or three axons. All endplates in wild-type littermates had only one axon terminal per endplate. We assessed the function of polyinnervated junctions in <italic>ostes</italic> mice by intracellular recordings of nerve-evoked endplate potentials (EPPs) in extensor digitorum longus (EDL) and soleus muscle from <italic>ostes</italic>/<italic>ostes</italic> (<italic>n</italic> = 3) mice. Recordings from <italic>ostes</italic>/<italic>ostes</italic> muscle in response to graded stimulation of the nerve supply resolved two components to the EPP with distinct thresholds in 20&#x02013;30% of muscle fibres (<italic>n</italic> = 15&#x02013;18 fibres per muscle), indicating functional polyneuronal innervation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP304F1">1</xref>G). These recordings corroborated the morphological evidence of enduring polyneuronal innervation in <italic>ostes</italic>/<italic>ostes</italic> mice. Fibre type distribution in the soleus muscle region did not show any differences between <italic>ostes</italic>/<italic>ostes</italic> and wild-type staining. Fibre size asymmetry did not correlate with specific fibre type, and there was no evidence of fibre type grouping (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP304F1">1</xref>I and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ddp304/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S4</ext-link>).</p><p>To assess whether this polyinnervation was due to a delay in developmental synapse elimination at the neuromuscular junction (NMJ), we examined motor endplates in 9-month-old <italic>ostes</italic>/<italic>ostes</italic> mice (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP304F1">1</xref>F). Polyinnervated endplates were also observed in these mice, suggesting that this phenotype was persistent and not due to prolongation of the period over which synapse elimination would normally occur (1&#x02013;2 weeks postnatal). <italic>Ostes</italic>/+ mice also showed evidence of polyinnervation, but at lesser incidence than <italic>ostes</italic>/<italic>ostes</italic> mice, and polyinnervation was not unequivocally found to be functional (<italic>n</italic> = 2 mice, data not shown). In both young and old <italic>ostes</italic>/<italic>ostes</italic> and <italic>ostes</italic>/+ mice, normal mononeuronal innervation of endplates was also observed (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP304F1">1</xref>F). Therefore, three distinctive types of endplates were characteristically observed in lumbrical muscles from <italic>ostes</italic>/<italic>ostes</italic> mice: monoinnervated (&#x0223c;50%, <italic>n</italic> = 3), denervated (&#x0223c;10%, <italic>n</italic> = 3) and polyinnervated (&#x0223c;40%, <italic>n</italic> = 3).</p><p>The specific effects of the morphological changes in <italic>ostes</italic>/<italic>ostes</italic> muscle on muscle function were also established. We found that the hind limb muscles of <italic>ostes</italic>/<italic>ostes</italic> mice were weaker than the corresponding muscles in age-matched wild-type controls. Whereas tibialis anterior (TA) muscles in wild-type mice produced a maximum tetanic force of 137<italic>g</italic> (&#x000b1;5.3 SEM, <italic>n</italic> = 6), this was reduced to only 32<italic>g</italic> (&#x000b1;2.1 SEM, <italic>n</italic> = 10) in <italic>ostes</italic>/<italic>ostes</italic> mice (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP304F2">2</xref>A). Similarly, the maximum force in EDL muscles of wild-type mice was 25<italic>g</italic> (&#x000b1;3.1 SEM, <italic>n</italic> = 8) compared with only 13<italic>g</italic> (&#x000b1;0.8 SEM, <italic>n</italic> = 7) in <italic>ostes</italic>/<italic>ostes</italic> mice (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP304F2">2</xref>A). The contractile characteristics of these muscles in <italic>ostes</italic>/<italic>ostes</italic> mice were also assessed. Although the time to peak force and the time taken to reach half relaxation force were the same in TA and EDL muscles of <italic>ostes</italic>/<italic>ostes</italic> and wild-type mice (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP304F2">2</xref>B), there was a significant change in the fatigue characteristics of EDL muscles in <italic>ostes</italic>/<italic>ostes</italic> mice (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP304F2">2</xref>C). EDL is normally a fast muscle that fatigues rapidly when repeatedly stimulated (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP304F2">2</xref>C).

Two further outcrosses, to the C57BL<italic>/</italic>6J and FVB inbred strains, also independently confirmed significant linkage to the same region on chromosome 8 (data not shown). Since the FVB strain showed the highest rate of polymorphism with the initial mutagenized background, this strain was selected for high-resolution mapping.

To confirm this finding, we used a commercial next<italic>-</italic>generation sequencing approach (NGS) to sequence all exons in the interval.

However, we considered <italic>Pkd1l2</italic> to be a good candidate on the basis of the association of the homologous <italic>PKD1</italic> gene with disease and the fact that all genes in the non-recombinant region except <italic>Pkd1l2</italic> had been effectively ruled out. Thus, for all these other genes, no coding or splicing mutations and no significant expression differences between the mutant and control were found.

Since a full-length <italic>Pkd1l2</italic> cDNA could not be amplified (discussed earlier), we opted to use a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) to generate a transgenic line. A BAC (RP23-269J16) was selected which contained the full-length genomic sequence of <italic>Pkd1l2</italic> and the small flanking genes <italic>Bcmo1</italic> and <italic>Gcsh</italic>. These flanking sequences were required to include the promoter and other possible regulatory elements in the vicinity of the <italic>Pkd1l2</italic> gene. Following microinjection of the BAC into fertilized oocytes, a transgenic founder was identified (<italic>Tg</italic>(<italic>Pkd1l2</italic>)_#1). Subsequent crosses showed that the BAC was transmitted to 57.5% (57 of 99) of offspring from this mouse, thus indicating a single integration site. We examined hemizygous <italic>Tg</italic>(<italic>Pkd1l2</italic>)/0 mice for evidence of neuromuscular dysfunction. <italic>Tg</italic>(<italic>Pkd1l2</italic>)/0 mice were indistinguishable from wild-type littermates and did not show any overt phenotype, and histological analysis did not reveal any anomalies on H&#x00026;E-stained hind limb skeletal muscle sections (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP304F1">1</xref>J). However, on intercrossing <italic>Tg</italic>(<italic>Pkd1l2</italic>)/0 mice, we found that homozygous <italic>Tg</italic>(<italic>Pkd1l2</italic>)/<italic>Tg</italic>(<italic>Pkd1l2</italic>) mice showed extreme growth retardation and developed progressive hind limb dragging and paralysis between 4 and 6 weeks of age. Nineteen per cent of intercross offspring displayed this phenotype (13/64), and 3% were found dead around this age (2/64), indicating that some post-natal loss may be occurring. H&#x00026;E-stained skeletal muscle sections from these mice showed extreme fibre size asymmetry, pyknotic nuclei, small centrally nucleated fibres and no evidence of macrophage infiltration, strongly recapitulating the pathological hallmarks seen in <italic>ostes</italic>/<italic>ostes</italic> mice (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP304F1">1</xref>C, D and E and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ddp304/DC1">Supplementary Material, Figs S1 and S2</ext-link>). Similar pathology was seen in pharyngeal muscle and diaphragm, but not in any other 23 tissues analysed including the heart (not shown). Moreover, fibre type analysis revealed a similar distribution of fast and slow fibres to <italic>ostes</italic>/<italic>ostes</italic> muscle, again showing a lack of both fibre-specific hypertrophy and clustering (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP304F1">1</xref>I and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ddp304/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S4</ext-link>).

Additionally, polyinnervated and denervated endplates were also evident in homozygous <italic>Tg</italic>(<italic>Pkd1l2</italic>)/<italic>Tg</italic>(<italic>Pkd1l2</italic>) mice (<italic>n</italic> = 4, representative examples shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP304F1">1</xref>H).</p><p>Given the similarities between the <italic>ostes</italic> and <italic>Tg</italic>(<italic>Pkd1l2</italic>) myopathies, these results theoretically reduced the genetic cause of the <italic>ostes</italic> disease to the upregulation of any of the three genes in the BAC: <italic>Bcmo1</italic>, <italic>Pkd1l2</italic> or <italic>Gcsh</italic>. We had already established that PKD1L2 protein was elevated in <italic>ostes</italic> mice. To unequivocally establish how expression levels of these three candidate genes correlated with the <italic>ostes</italic> neuromuscular disease, further expression analysis was carried out. Real-time quantitative PCR was performed using skeletal muscle from 10 <italic>ostes</italic>/<italic>ostes</italic> mice and 10 age- and sex-matched wild-type controls. The results were consistent with the microarray results described earlier: expression of <italic>Bcmo1</italic> or <italic>Gcsh</italic> was not significantly different in <italic>ostes</italic>/<italic>ostes</italic> mice (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ddp304/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S5B</ext-link>), whereas <italic>Pkd1l2</italic> was not detected at sufficient levels for a reliable analysis. Therefore, <italic>Bcmo1</italic> and <italic>Gcsh</italic> have no coding or regulatory mutations in <italic>ostes</italic>/<italic>ostes</italic> mice. Western blot analysis of skeletal muscle from <italic>Tg</italic>(<italic>Pkd1l2</italic>)/<italic>Tg</italic>(<italic>Pkd1l2</italic>) mice showed that full-length PKD1L2 was indeed overexpressed in this line (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP304F5">5</xref>). Further proof that the myopathies described in <italic>ostes</italic> and <italic>Tg</italic>(<italic>Pkd1l2</italic>) homozygous mice share a common pathogenic mechanism could be obtained from making double heterozygotes. Thus, if ectopic expression of PKD1L2 as a result of an ENU mutation or expression from a BAC clone was respectively underlying myopathic changes in <italic>ostes</italic>/<italic>ostes</italic> and <italic>Tg</italic>(<italic>Pkd1l2</italic>)<italic>/Tg</italic>(<italic>Pkd1l2</italic>) mice, we could expect double-heterozygous mice (<italic>ostes</italic>/+, <italic>Tg</italic>(<italic>Pkd1l2</italic>)/0) to show a more severe pathology than the mild changes observed in <italic>ostes</italic>/+ mice. In young mice, approximately 45 days old, the presence of the BAC clearly exacerbated the mild myopathic changes of <italic>ostes</italic> heterozygotes without adding any new distinctive feature (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ddp304/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S3</ext-link>). This result suggests that increasing the copy number of the <italic>Pkd1l2</italic> gene results in worsening of the pathology caused by the ENU mutation. Moreover, <italic>ostes</italic>/+, <italic>Tg</italic>(<italic>Pkd1l2</italic>)<italic>/</italic>0 mice (<italic>n</italic> = 3) showed a late-onset muscular atrophy and weakness of the hind limbs between 6 and 10 months old, with foot-curling, unstable gait and similar myopathic changes to those observed in <italic>ostes</italic>/<italic>ostes</italic> and <italic>Tg</italic>(<italic>Pkd1l2</italic>)<italic>/Tg</italic>(<italic>Pkd1l2</italic>) muscles (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP304F1">1</xref>J). These features were not found in aged <italic>ostes</italic>/+ (<italic>n</italic> = 6) or <italic>Tg</italic>(<italic>Pkd1l2</italic>)/0 mice (<italic>n</italic> = 3) (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP304F1">1</xref>J). These results indicated that <italic>ostes</italic> and <italic>Tg</italic>(<italic>Pkd1l2</italic>) interact genetically and strongly supported the hypothesis that the upregulation of PKD1L2 causes neuromuscular disease. These results did not strictly exclude the possibility that a new mutation caused by the insertion of the BAC and not the BAC itself was responsible for the phenotype observed in the transgenic line. However, the specificity of the pathological changes in the ENU-induced and BAC-induced mutant lines and the genetic interaction between the underlying genetic loci made that possibility unlikely.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>PKD1L2 interacts with fatty acid synthase <italic>in vivo</italic></title><p>Our data showed that overexpression of PKD1L2 was associated with neuromuscular dysfunction in two mouse mutants. However, neither PKD1L2 nor other TRPP channels have previously been shown to have roles in muscle. To explore a molecular role for PKD1L2 in muscle, we examined PKD1L2 protein complexes by immunoprecipitation from adult mouse skeletal muscle lysates. Immunocomplexes precipitated with antibody APKD1L2_1 were analysed by SDS&#x02013;PAGE and mass spectrometry to identify PKD1L2-interacting proteins. Upon gel staining, a very prominent band was observed migrating at &#x0223c;268 kDa, which was absent in the negative control lane (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP304F4">4</xref>C). A peptide mass fingerprint was generated from this band by mass spectrometry. Database search using ProFound identified PKD1L2, as expected, but additionally the enzyme fatty acid synthase (FASN) was identified as the top scorer. FASN was also identified from bands of smaller molecular weight, probably reflecting partial degradation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP304F4">4</xref>C). The identity of this protein was confirmed by western blot with a monoclonal antibody against FASN (mAFASN) following immunoprecipitation with APKD1L2_1 antibody, from both wild-type and <italic>ostes</italic>/<italic>ostes</italic> skeletal muscle soluble fractions (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP304F4">4</xref>D). To further confirm the association between PKD1L2 and FASN, we carried out immunoprecipitation using mAFASN on wild-type and <italic>ostes</italic>/<italic>ostes</italic> skeletal muscle soluble fractions. FASN was efficiently immunoprecipitated, and subsequent western blot analysis confirmed that PKD1L2 was present in the immunoprecipitated complex. The same results were obtained using wild-type skeletal muscle membrane fraction (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP304F4">4</xref>D). Since the molecular weight of FASN is equivalent to that of PKD1L2 (272 kDa), and the two proteins co-migrate, this analysis did not exclude the possibility that the APKD1L2_1 antibody might be cross-reacting with FASN protein. To test for such cross-reactivity, we examined PKD1L2 and FASN protein expression in different mouse tissues. This analysis demonstrated that whereas FASN was strongly expressed in every tissue examined, expression of PKD1L2 was more restricted, thus indicating that the APKD1L2_1 antibody does not recognize FASN (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ddp304/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S6A</ext-link>). Analysis of the same samples using non-denaturing conditions produced a different pattern for both antibodies on western blots (data not shown), suggesting that PKD1L2_1 antibodies did not cross-react against the FASN native form either. Moreover, affinity-purified antibody APKD1L2_2, raised against a different PKD1L2 epitope, also immunoprecipitated FASN (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ddp304/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S6B</ext-link>), and the reciprocal immunoprecipitation using mAFASN antibody also produced a &#x0223c;268 kDa protein recognized by antibody APKD1L2_2, confirming the co-immunoprecipitation of FASN and PKD1L2 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ddp304/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S6B</ext-link>).</p><p>Despite PKD1L2 being a predicted transmembrane protein and FASN a soluble cytoplasmic enzyme, their association as revealed by immunoprecipitation of endogenous proteins suggested that these proteins must have overlapping subcellular localizations. To assess this, immunostainings on cross- and longitudinal sections of fresh-frozen skeletal muscle samples were performed with APKD1L2_1 and a goat polyclonal antibody against FASN (gAFASN). PKD1L2 and FASN were found localized to the membrane on cross-sections (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP304F6">6</xref>A). On longitudinal sections, both antibodies produced overlapping localizations at striations overlying the Z-discs on the surface of the fibre (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP304F6">6</xref>A, middle panel) but not at the centre (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP304F6">6</xref>A, bottom panel).

An identical pattern was observed with antibody APKD1L2_2, and for both PKD1L2 antibodies, the fluorescent signal was effectively blocked upon pre-incubation with their respective antigenic peptides (data not shown). On the other hand, expression of PKD1L2 was also detected at slightly higher levels at the postsynaptic membrane of the NMJs (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP304F7">7</xref>A and B).</p><fig id="DDP304F6" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;6.</label><caption><p>Co-localization of PKD1L2 and FASN in skeletal muscle.

Surprisingly, we found that FASN was overexpressed in <italic>ostes</italic>/<italic>ostes</italic> and <italic>Tg</italic>(<italic>Pkd1l2</italic>)/<italic>Tg</italic>(<italic>Pkd1l2</italic>) skeletal muscle by western blot analysis, mirroring the overexpression of PKD1L2 (<italic>n</italic> = 12, representative samples shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP304F5">5</xref>). Overexpression of FASN was observed in both soluble and membrane fractions (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP304F5">5</xref>) and was also confirmed to occur at the transcriptional level (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ddp304/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S8A</ext-link>). The growth defect exhibited by the <italic>ostes</italic> mouse is counterintuitive to an overexpression of FASN, as the latter is generally found in conditions of metabolic overload such as obesity (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP304C9">9</xref>). We therefore hypothesized that PKD1L2 acts as a negative regulator of FASN and that the upregulation of PKD1L2 in the ENU and transgenic lines results in decreased FASN activity. In this hypothesis, the increased expression of FASN in skeletal muscle of <italic>ostes</italic> mice would result from a positive feedback regulatory mechanism. Relative activity of FASN to total amount of FASN protein was measured in soluble fractions of <italic>ostes</italic>/<italic>ostes</italic> and wild-type muscle by spectrophotometric analysis of NADPH &#x0003e; NADP+ oxidation. Although there is a clear trend showing reduced relative activity in <italic>ostes</italic>/<italic>ostes</italic> mice, FASN activity varied widely in individual samples of the same genotype, making the difference between <italic>ostes</italic>/<italic>ostes</italic> and control statistically not significant (<italic>P</italic> = 0.236) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ddp304/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S8B</ext-link>). Therefore, we looked for other biochemical markers of lipid metabolism to determine whether fatty acid biosynthesis was abnormal in <italic>ostes</italic>/<italic>ostes</italic> mice. We assessed the blood plasma lipid profile of <italic>ostes</italic>/<italic>ostes</italic> mice (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP304F8">8</xref>A).

Indeed, the genetic mechanism leading to the upregulation of the linked <italic>Pkd1l2</italic> gene in <italic>ostes</italic> mice remains elusive despite meticulous sequencing efforts. However, as indicated by the total protein levels, <italic>Pkd1l2</italic> is the only gene in the non-recombinant region that is upregulated in <italic>ostes/ostes</italic> mice, and there are identical pathological findings in <italic>ostes/ostes</italic> and <italic>Tg</italic>(<italic>Pkd1l2</italic>)<italic>/Tg</italic>(<italic>Pkd1l2</italic>) mice. Common histological hallmarks include muscle fibre asymmetry, scattered regenerating fibres, a lack of fibre type grouping, whole-muscle atrophy and an irregular innervation pattern. Conversely, typical dystrophic changes such as excessive connective tissue or macrophage infiltration are not present in either mutant. Disease manifestation is more severe in <italic>Tg</italic>(<italic>Pkd1l2</italic>)/<italic>Tg</italic>(<italic>Pkd1l2</italic>) probably because the BAC transgene does not exactly replicate the changes in <italic>Pkd1l2</italic> gene expression caused by the <italic>ostes</italic> ENU mutation. Intriguingly, neither <italic>ostes</italic>/+ nor <italic>Tg</italic>(<italic>Pkd1l2</italic>)/0 mice showed any overt phenotype at young or old age (&#x0003e;9 months), but the double heterozygote suffered from a more severe myopathy that resulted in late-onset gait defects. Hind limb muscle histology of the latter showed changes qualitatively similar to those found in young <italic>ostes</italic>/<italic>ostes</italic> mice and much more profound than those of age-matched single heterozygotes. Altogether, these results suggested that overexpression of <italic>Pkd1l2</italic>, which was demonstrated at the protein level in both mutants, provokes neuromuscular disease in mice. Pathological changes were not found in any other tissue, including sciatic nerve and spinal cord, suggesting that skeletal muscle is the primary target tissue of this disease. The polyinnervation defects found in <italic>ostes</italic> mice could thus be secondary to the myopathic changes, but since PKD1L2 accumulates at NMJs on the postsynaptic membrane, a role for this protein in regulating the stability of NMJs is possible and merits further investigation.</p><p>PKD1L2 belongs to the TRPP family of proteins. The transient receptor potential (TRP) superfamily comprises a large group of cation channel proteins usually containing six transmembrane domains, which, despite having diverse functions and expression, appear to function as critical sensors of environmental stimuli, at both organism and cellular levels (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP304C10">10</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP304C11">11</xref>). The TRPP family includes two genes that are associated with human disease: mutation of TRPP1/PKD1 or TRPP2/PKD2 cause polycystic kidney disease in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP304C12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP304C13">13</xref>) and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP304C14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP304C15">15</xref>). Other TRPP1-like genes have been shown to have roles in taste reception (<italic>Pkd1l3</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP304C16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP304C17">17</xref>)) and reproductive success (<italic>Pkdrej</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP304C18">18</xref>)). Thus far, no TRPP genes have been associated with neuromuscular function or disease. PKD1L2 is a large, complex protein of unknown function. It is predicted to act as an ion channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP304C7">7</xref>) and has also been reported to bind <italic>in vitro</italic> to two G-proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP304C19">19</xref>). The presence of FASN as the major component of the PKD1L2-immunoprecipitated complex in skeletal muscle suggests a functional relationship between these proteins in this tissue. In mammals, FASN synthesizes <italic>de novo</italic> long-chain, saturated fatty acids from malonyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA, and is therefore a critical enzyme in lipogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP304C20">20</xref>). In muscle, both imported and <italic>de novo-</italic>synthesized fatty acids are used as an energy source via beta oxidation. The increased levels of FASN protein in the skeletal muscle of <italic>ostes</italic> mice are due to the upregulation at the transcriptional level. This is not a non-specific response of skeletal muscle to a disease condition because the actively regenerating muscles of the muscular dystrophy <italic>ky</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP304C21">21</xref>) do not show FASN upregulation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ddp304/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S9</ext-link>). However, the finding that FASN is overexpressed in <italic>ostes</italic>/<italic>ostes</italic> mice is intriguing because <italic>ostes</italic>/<italic>ostes</italic> mice are small and lean. Intriguingly, the dramatic accumulation of FASN in <italic>ostes</italic>/<italic>ostes</italic> skeletal muscle did not result in an increase of FASN activity. In fact, blood measurements of TGs and FFAs as well as total fat deposition would suggest that lipid metabolism is indeed compromised in the <italic>ostes</italic> homozygote. Given that muscle has a particularly high metabolic need for fatty acids driven by its high-energy demand, a reduction in FASN activity would predictably compromise muscle function. Mice homozygous for a null allele of FASN show embryonic lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP304C22">22</xref>), but skeletal muscle was not examined in surviving <italic>Fasn</italic> heterozygous mice. A direct involvement of FASN activity in muscle disease or indeed the pathogenic mechanism of <italic>ostes</italic> cannot be tested at the present time, as a <italic>Fasn</italic> skeletal-muscle conditional knockout mouse has not been reported. However, a rare case of <italic>de novo</italic> fatty acid synthesis deficiency resulting in persistent myopathy and poor growth has been reported in humans. This defect was due to the deficiency of the acetyl-CoA carboxylase enzyme, which catalyses the formation of the FASN substrate malonyl-CoA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP304C23">23</xref>), indicating that insufficient fatty acid synthesis can cause pathological changes in skeletal muscle. Moreover, the microarray data generated in this work identified lipid metabolism as the major biological pathway altered in <italic>ostes</italic>/<italic>ostes</italic> skeletal muscle: eight out of the top nine genes upregulated in <italic>ostes</italic>/<italic>ostes</italic> muscle have functions in lipid metabolism (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ddp304/DC1">Supplementary Material, Table S2</ext-link>; see also deposited data ArrayExpress, accession number E-MEXP-1873). Therefore, lipogenesis is altered at skeletal muscle and systemic levels in <italic>ostes</italic>/<italic>ostes</italic> mice. The precise reasons for the tissue specificity of this disease remain to be established. Concomitant upregulation of FASN and PKD1L2 was also detected in the kidney, but here the increase in FASN is smaller than that observed in muscle; overexpression of both PKD1L2 and FASN was not detected in other tissues from <italic>ostes</italic>/<italic>ostes</italic> mice, including the brain, spinal cord and liver (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ddp304/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S10A</ext-link>). In conclusion, our data suggest that PKD1L2-induced dysregulation of lipid metabolism is a cause of complex neuromuscular defects in mice. On that basis, we propose that PKD1L2 and defective fatty acid synthesis should be assessed, respectively, as a genetic risk factor and as a precipitating cause of neuromuscular disorders in humans.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>Additional methods are detailed in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ddp304/DC1">Supplementary Material</ext-link>.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Antibodies</title><p>Polyclonal antibodies to mouse PKD1L2 were generated in rabbit using two PKD1L2 peptides (APKD1L2_1: LVASTKVRPEDQRRQEATRA; APKD1L2_2: GNSKLVGSAHIRQVRVRE) and independently affinity-purified (NeoMPS Inc., San Diego, CA, USA).</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Genetic mapping</title><p>The in-house-generated marker used was a microsatellite marker FM3 (forward primer: 5&#x02032;-TCTGGGTTGGATGGACATTT-3&#x02032;; reverse primer: 5&#x02032;-CCCAGATGATGGAAGGAGAA-3&#x02032;).
