Parathyroid hormone (PTH) stimulates formation of cAMP and sensitizes inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (IP<sub>3</sub>R) to IP<sub>3</sub>. We show that PTH communicates with IP<sub>3</sub>R via &#x0201c;cAMP junctions&#x0201d; that allow local delivery of a supramaximal concentration of cAMP to IP<sub>3</sub>R, directly increasing their sensitivity to IP<sub>3</sub>. These junctions are robust binary switches that are digitally recruited by increasing concentrations of PTH. Human embryonic kidney cells express several isoforms of adenylyl cyclase (AC) and IP<sub>3</sub>R, but IP<sub>3</sub>R2 and AC6 are specifically associated, and inhibition of AC6 or IP<sub>3</sub>R2 expression by small interfering RNA selectively attenuates potentiation of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> signals by PTH. We define two modes of cAMP signaling: binary, where cAMP passes directly from AC6 to IP<sub>3</sub>R2; and analogue, where local gradients of cAMP concentration regulate cAMP effectors more remote from AC. Binary signaling requires localized delivery of cAMP, whereas analogue signaling is more dependent on localized cAMP degradation.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>S.C. Tovey, S.G.

The versatility of intracellular messengers is increased by their precise spatial and temporal organization. Local increases in Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berridge, 1997</xref>) or cAMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zaccolo and Pozzan, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mongillo et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Smith et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Willoughby and Cooper, 2007</xref>) can selectively regulate closely associated proteins, whereas more global changes regulate different processes. Both Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> and cAMP can also be delivered in precise temporal patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berridge, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gorbunova and Spitzer, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dyachok et al., 2006</xref>). The frequencies of these messenger spikes are important in determining responses to Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dupont et al., 2003</xref>) and are also likely also to be important for cAMP spikes. The versatility of both messengers is increased further by interactions between them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bruce et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Werry et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Screaton et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Willoughby and Cooper, 2007</xref>). Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, for example, regulates cAMP formation and degradation, and by regulating protein kinases and calcineurin, it modulates many effects of protein kinase A (PKA). Conversely, cAMP regulates formation and phosphorylation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>), the activities of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> channels and pumps, and formation of other Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-mobilizing messengers. Such interactions endow cells with computational ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bray, 1995</xref>). Many proteins involved in cAMP and Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> signaling exist in multiple isoforms, which may differ in behavior and expression. This diversity adds further to the complexity of the signaling pathways, but its physiological significance is incompletely understood.</p><p>Parathyroid hormone (PTH) plays a central role in the regulation of plasma Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> concentration, although its receptors are also expressed in tissues unrelated to Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> homeostasis. Each of the related PTH receptors (types 1 and 2) belongs to the family of G protein&#x02013;coupled receptors that includes those for secretin, calcitonin, and glucagon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">J&#x000fc;ppner et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Behar et al., 1996</xref>). PTH receptors share with these an ability to both stimulate adenylyl cyclase (AC) and increase cytosolic Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> concentration ([Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>]<sub>i</sub>), but it is unclear how PTH stimulates Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> release from intracellular stores. Some evidence suggests that PTH receptors stimulate PLC-&#x003b2; via Gq or Gi, and thus formation of IP<sub>3</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">J&#x000fc;ppner et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mahon et al., 2006</xref>). PTH receptors might also, like &#x003b2;-adrenoceptors, activate PLC-<italic>&#x003b5;</italic> via cAMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schmidt et al., 2001</xref>). Other evidence suggests that Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> release occurs without formation of IP<sub>3</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Seuwen and Boddeke, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Short and Taylor, 2000</xref>), and perhaps even in the presence of an antagonist of IP<sub>3</sub> receptors (IP<sub>3</sub>R; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Seuwen and Boddeke, 1995</xref>). We (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Short and Taylor, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tovey et al., 2003</xref>) and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buckley et al., 2001</xref>) have suggested that PTH potentiates IP<sub>3</sub>-evoked Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> release, but the intracellular signals responsible have not been identified.</p><p>Here, we find that PTH, and other receptors that stimulate cAMP formation, communicate with IP<sub>3</sub>R via intracellular &#x0201c;cAMP junctions,&#x0201d; wherein cAMP passes directly from a specific isoform of AC (AC6) to a specific subtype of IP<sub>3</sub>R (IP<sub>3</sub>R2) to increase its IP<sub>3</sub> sensitivity. This identifies IP<sub>3</sub>R as a new target for cAMP, an unexpected interaction between two ubiquitous signaling pathways, and a novel binary mode of cAMP signaling that allows robust digital recruitment of a response by graded concentrations of an extracellular stimulus.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>PTH potentiates IP<sub>3</sub>-evoked Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> release entirely via cAMP</title><p>Carbachol (CCh), via endogenous muscarinic receptors, stimulates PLC and thereby IP<sub>3</sub> formation and Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> release from the intracellular stores of human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). In the absence of extracellular Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, stimulation of HEK cells stably expressing human type 1 PTH receptors (HEK-PR1 cells) with a supramaximal concentration of CCh caused an increase in [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>]<sub>i</sub> that returned to basal levels within 60&#x02013;70 s. The addition of PTH, in the continued presence of CCh, evoked a further release of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). This additional Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> release results from sensitization of IP<sub>3</sub>R to IP<sub>3</sub> (Fig. S1, A and B, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200803172/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200803172/DC1</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Short and Taylor, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tovey et al., 2003</xref>). Some analogues of PTH recruit other signaling pathways without stimulating AC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Takasu et al., 1999</xref>), but only the analogues that stimulate AC potentiated Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> release (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, E and F</xref>). Prostaglandin E<sub>1</sub> (PGE<sub>1</sub>; unpublished data) and isoproterenol, which stimulate AC via their endogenous receptors, also potentiated CCh-evoked Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> signals. So too did forskolin (FK), which directly stimulates AC (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, B&#x02013;D</xref>). However, 1,9-dideoxyforskolin (100 &#x003bc;M), an FK analogue that does not stimulate AC but mimics the AC-independent effects of FK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zerr et al., 1996</xref>), had no effect on [Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>]<sub>i</sub> either alone or with CCh (unpublished data).

Single cell analyses established that in most cells that responded to CCh (98 &#x000b1; 1%), the Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> signal was potentiated by PTH (99 &#x000b1; 1%), isoproterenol (80 &#x000b1; 4%), and FK (95 &#x000b1; 3%).</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Potentiation of CCh-stimulated Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> release by stimuli that evoke cAMP formation.</bold> (A) After addition of 10 mM 1,2-<italic>bis</italic>(<italic>o</italic>-aminophenoxy)ethane-<italic>N</italic>,<italic>N</italic>,<italic>N</italic>&#x02032;,<italic>N</italic>&#x02032;-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA) to chelate extracellular Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, 1 mM CCh stimulated transient release of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> from intracellular stores (black). 100 nM PTH in the continued presence of CCh then stimulated further Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> release (red).

Two independently acting stimuli should cause an additive increase in CCh sensitivity. It is significant, therefore, that maximal concentrations of 8-Br-cAMP and PTH had the same effects on both the sensitivity of the Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> signals to CCh and the maximal response (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 E</xref>), and it is also significant that their effects were not additive (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 F</xref>). The nonadditive effects of PTH and 8-Br-cAMP on the EC<sub>50</sub> for CCh-evoked Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> signals establish the fact that cAMP is the only signal linking PTH receptors to sensitization of IP<sub>3</sub>R (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 G</xref>). G protein &#x003b2;&#x003b3; subunits have been reported to stimulate IP<sub>3</sub>R directly and so to cause release of Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zeng et al., 2003</xref>). PTH cannot work via this pathway because PTH does not alone cause Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> release (Fig. S1), nor does somatostatin (1 &#x003bc;M), which activates Gi and thereby the release of &#x003b2;&#x003b3; subunits (unpublished data; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Law et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Willoughby et al., 2007</xref>).

Maximally activated receptors often generate more intracellular messenger than needed to evoke a maximal response. This allows downstream events to be more sensitive (lower EC<sub>50</sub>) than earlier ones to the initial signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Strickland and Loeb, 1981</xref>).

Signaling by cAMP must be local, and within a signaling complex, a receptor must generate substantially more cAMP than needed maximally to sensitize associated IP<sub>3</sub>R (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 H</xref>). Each complex, or cAMP junction, operates with a large safety margin so that even substantial inhibition of AC fails to compromise communication with IP<sub>3</sub>R. The concentration-dependent effects of PTH (or FK) come from recruitment of increasing numbers of these hyperactive junctions and not from increased activity within each (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 H</xref>). For receptors, the safety margin might arise at various steps of the signaling pathway: a single receptor might, for example, sustain the activity of more Gs than needed to stimulate sufficient AC to cause maximal activation of associated IP<sub>3</sub>R (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 I</xref>). But for FK, only cAMP lies between it and the IP<sub>3</sub>R, and yet the Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> signals evoked by any concentration of FK are also insensitive to substantial inhibition of AC (Fig. S3, A and B). Activation of a single AC can, therefore, deliver more cAMP than needed maximally to sensitize the IP<sub>3</sub>R associated with it. This defines the minimal signaling complex: an AC&#x02013;IP<sub>3</sub>R junction (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 I</xref>, box). The key point is that each active receptor (or AC) saturates the local signaling machinery and so functions as a local on&#x02013;off switch. The very low affinity of the cAMP-binding site of the IP<sub>3</sub>R (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref>) effectively insulates each signaling complex from its neighbors because diffusion will reduce the cAMP concentration to below that needed to sensitize IP<sub>3</sub>R within just a few nanometers of the complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rich et al., 2000</xref>). This digital signaling to IP<sub>3</sub>R imposes no requirement for individual PTH receptors (or AC) to differ in their sensitivities; PTH binding to a uniform population of PTH receptors, governed by the law of mass action, is sufficient to generate a graded increase in the number of active receptors as the PTH concentration increases.</p><p>Our scheme (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, H and I</xref>) predicts that AC and IP<sub>3</sub>R are intimately associated, and that complete inhibition of cAMP formation within some junctions should more effectively attenuate Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> signaling than partial inhibition of all junctions. Subsequent experiments confirm these predictions, but first we provide additional evidence that cAMP mediates the effects of PTH.</p><p>We established stable HEK-PR1 cell lines in which expression of G&#x003b1;s was reduced by &#x0003e;95% by means of siRNA (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 A</xref>).

These results show that when the safety margin for signaling between PTH receptors and IP<sub>3</sub>R is eroded by removal of G&#x003b1;s, the requirement for AC activity is unmasked.

The results show that only AC6 is immunoprecipitated, and only by AbIP<sub>3</sub>R2. The results were not further quantified because overexpression of AC probably prevents more than a small fraction of it from associating with IP<sub>3</sub>R. (E) We suggest that only IP<sub>3</sub>R2 and AC6 interact directly (top), but hetero-oligomeric assemblies of AC or IP<sub>3</sub>R may allow lesser amounts of IP<sub>3</sub>R3 subunits or AC3 to associate with the AC6-IP<sub>3</sub>R2 junction.

We conclude that AC6 and IP<sub>3</sub>R2 are specifically associated, and their intimacy is sufficient to allow cAMP to pass between them without encountering PDE. This reveals an important distinction between two different modes of cAMP signaling: binary (to IP<sub>3</sub>R) and analogue (to PKA and epac). Because epac and PKA bind cAMP with high affinity, they can respond in a graded fashion to cAMP diffusing to them from a distant AC, but they then assemble with PDE to ensure effective local degradation of the messenger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dodge-Kafka et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Willoughby et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">2007</xref>). In contrast, IP<sub>3</sub>R, with their low affinity for cAMP, must be very close to AC, but diffusion alone is enough to terminate the signaling. Both modes of cAMP signaling generate spatially organized responses: the analogue mode used by high-affinity cAMP sensors relies on local degradation of cAMP, whereas the binary mode requires local synthesis of cAMP to deliver it at high concentration to a low-affinity cAMP sensor (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 G</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Potentiation of IP<sub>3</sub>-evoked Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> signals by PTH specifically requires AC6 and IP<sub>3</sub>R2</title><p>We used siRNA to inhibit selectively the expression of IP<sub>3</sub>R2, IP<sub>3</sub>R1, AC3, and AC6 (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9 A</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table III</xref>).

These feedback interactions may generate highly localized oscillations in both Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> and cAMP similar to those observed in whole cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gorbunova and Spitzer, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dyachok et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>The AC&#x02013;IP<sub>3</sub>R junction suggests an analogy with excitation&#x02013;contraction coupling in striated muscle, where voltage-sensing dihydropyridine receptors (DHPR) in the plasma membrane regulate opening of ryanodine receptors in the SR across a narrow (&#x0223c;10 nm) junctional complex (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10 D</xref>). Coupling of these proteins has evolved from chemical coupling mediated by Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> (cardiac excitation&#x02013;contraction coupling) to a physical coupling between the two apposed proteins (vertebrate skeletal muscle; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Di Biase and Franzini-Armstrong, 2005</xref>). Junctional complexes similar to those in striated muscle occur also in nonexcitable cells; they are implicated in Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Treves et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Varnai et al., 2007</xref>), and their width (10&#x02013;15 nm) would allow IP<sub>3</sub>R and AC to abut (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10 C</xref>). We speculate that the AC6&#x02013;IP<sub>3</sub>R2 complex may occur within such junctions, and that its evolution from the looser relationship between AC and PKA mediated by soluble cAMP may be similar to the evolution of conformational coupling in skeletal muscle from Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-mediated coupling in cardiac muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Di Biase and Franzini-Armstrong, 2005</xref>). The difference is that AC6&#x02013;IP<sub>3</sub>R2 communication requires not only direct contact but also passage of a constrained messenger, cAMP, between them (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10 B</xref>).</p><p>The IP<sub>3</sub>R is a new and important target of cAMP. The AC6&#x02013;IP<sub>3</sub>R2 complex allows cAMP to pass directly to IP<sub>3</sub>R and increase its sensitivity to IP<sub>3</sub>. These cAMP junctions (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10 B</xref>) allow robust signaling to IP<sub>3</sub>R because they are hyperactive on&#x02013;off switches (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 H</xref>). Increasing stimulus intensities recruit additional junctions, rather than increasing the activity within individual junctions. Signaling by cAMP to IP<sub>3</sub>R is binary, requires direct contact between AC6 and IP<sub>3</sub>R2, and relies on diffusion of cAMP to terminate the response of each junction. Other sensors with greater affinity for cAMP, like PKA and epac, respond to graded changes in local cAMP concentration (analogue signaling) and rely on PDE activity to shape local signaling events (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Figs. 7 G</xref> and <xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">10 D</xref>). These different modes of signaling considerably increase the versatility of cAMP as an intracellular messenger.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title><p>DDA, cAMP, 8-Br-cAMP, 8-Br-cGMP, H89 dihydrochloride, ionomycin, KT5720, adenosine 3&#x02032;,5&#x02032;-cyclic phosphorothioate-Rp (RpcAMPS), SQ 22536, and 1,2-<italic>bis</italic>(<italic>o</italic>-aminophenoxy)ethane-<italic>N</italic>,<italic>N</italic>,<italic>N</italic>&#x02032;,<italic>N</italic>&#x02032;-tetraacetic acid (BAPTA) were obtained from EMD. 8-Br-2'-<italic>O</italic>-methyladenosine-3&#x02032;,5&#x02032;-cAMP was obtained from Biolog.
