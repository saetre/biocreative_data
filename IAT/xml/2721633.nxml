The disease has been postulated to result from a combination of different environmental factors, including contamination of barley by mold mycotoxins, iodine deficiency, presence of humic substances in drinking water, and, importantly, deficiency of selenium. This multifunctional trace element, in the form of selenocysteine, is essential for normal selenoprotein function, including attenuation of excessive oxidative stress, and for the control of redox-sensitive molecules involved in cell growth and differentiation. To investigate the effects of skeletal selenoprotein deficiency, a Cre recombinase transgenic mouse line was used to trigger <italic>Trsp</italic> gene deletions in osteo-chondroprogenitors. <italic>Trsp</italic> encodes selenocysteine tRNA<sup>&#x0005b;Ser&#x0005d;Sec</sup>, required for the incorporation of selenocysteine residues into selenoproteins. The mutant mice exhibited growth retardation, epiphyseal growth plate abnormalities, and delayed skeletal ossification, as well as marked chondronecrosis of articular, auricular, and tracheal cartilages. Phenotypically, the mice thus replicated a number of the pathological features of Kashin-Beck disease, supporting the notion that selenium deficiency is important to the development of this syndrome.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Kashin-Beck disease (KBD) is a severe, chronic, and deforming musculoskeletal disease affecting millions of individuals in specific regions of Asia. Starting in childhood, the disorder leads to joint and limb deformities, short stature, and delayed skeletal development. Articular cartilage damage due to chondronecrosis and limb deformities then lead to secondary osteoarthritis and severe disability. Factors proposed to cause KBD include selenium deficiency, iodine deficiency, contamination of grain with toxic molds, and humic substances in well water. Soil and water deficiency in selenium (and iodine) are a consistent feature of KBD endemic areas, and affected individuals show profound deficiencies of these two elements. Thus far, there have been no convincing rodent models of KBD based on selenium (and/or iodine) deficiency achieved through dietary manipulation. Our manuscript describes a conditional gene mutation approach in mice that, in effect, mimics severe selenium deficiency, achieving this specifically within skeletal progenitor cells. By deleting selenocysteine tRNA (required for normal selenoprotein activity) in osteo-chondroprogenitors, we found that mice develop post-natal impairment of skeletal growth, dwarfism, delayed ossification, impaired endochondral bone formation, as well as severe chondronecrosis. Our mutant mouse supports the idea that selenium deficiency is key to the skeletal pathology of KBD.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Kashin-Beck disease, an environmentally-induced musculoskeletal syndrome, is prevalent in millions of individuals residing within specific regions of Tibet, China, Siberia, and North Korea <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000616-MorenoReyes1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000616-Sokoloff1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.

With age, severe secondary osteoarthritis of multiple joints becomes evident. Although several factors have been implicated in the pathogenesis of this disease, deficiency of dietary selenium intake, and hence, profoundly low serum selenium levels represent one of the most salient features of Kashin-Beck disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000616-MorenoReyes1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000616-Suetens1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000616-Zhang1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. This raised the possibility that deficiencies in one or more selenoproteins might play key etiological roles in this musculoskeletal disorder.</p><p>Selenium is an essential dietary micronutrient that is associated with various organic molecules, including the 21<sup>st</sup> amino acid, selenocysteine (Sec), that is required for the function of a class of proteins known as the selenoproteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000616-Hatfield1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. There are 25 human and 24 murine genes that encode for selenoproteins, approximately one third of which function as antioxidants, protecting cells against macromolecule damage caused by oxidative and/or nitrosative stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000616-Kryukov1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. Other members of the selenoprotein family include the deiodinases, including, for example, deiodinase 2 (D2) that catalyzes conversion of thyroxine (T<sub>4</sub>) into the active tri-iodothyronine (T<sub>3</sub>) form; the latter has many roles in growth and development, including the regulation of epiphyseal growth plate differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000616-Bassett1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000616-Gromer1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Selenoprotein synthesis requires that Sec residues be inserted into the growing polypeptide chains via specific UGA codons present within the coding regions of selenoprotein mRNAs. Although UGA specifies a &#x02018;stop&#x02019; codon in the universal genetic code, it can also code for Sec with the participation of a group of proteins that recognize the Sec insertion sequence (SECIS) element located in the 3&#x02032; untranslated region of selenoprotein mRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000616-SmallHoward1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. UGA is recognized by Sec tRNA (designated Sec tRNA<sup>&#x0005b;Ser&#x0005d;Sec</sup>) which is encoded by <italic>Trsp</italic> (present in one copy per haploid genome).</p><p>Sec tRNA<sup>&#x0005b;Ser&#x0005d;Sec</sup> is responsible for the expression of all selenoproteins and thus it provides a unique tool for studying the role of selenium within this class of proteins. The targeted deletion of <italic>Trsp</italic> is embryonic lethal owing to a loss of activity of selenoproteins that are essential for normal growth and development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000616-Kumaraswamy1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Hence, investigation of the tissue-specific consequences of selenoprotein loss <italic>in vivo</italic> must be carried out via a conditional mutagenesis approach. <italic>Cre</italic>-<italic>lox</italic>P technology has been successfully used to study the consequences of floxed <italic>Trsp</italic> gene <italic>(Trsp<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>) excision in cardiac muscle, hepatocytes, lymphocytes, mammary epithelium, and neurons, with pathological changes attributable to selenoprotein deficiency being demonstrated in all these tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000616-Hatfield1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In addition to dietary deficiency of selenium, deficiency of iodine, ingestion of fungal mycotoxins from contaminated stored food, high humic acid levels in the drinking water, or some combination of these components have been proposed to have roles in the genesis of Kashin-Beck disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000616-MorenoReyes1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000616-Suetens1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000616-Zhang1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000616-Zhang2">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. The relative contributions of the various environmental factors implicated in Kashin-Beck disease are not known but an emphasis has been placed on the role of selenium deficiency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000616-MorenoReyes1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000616-Ren1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000616-MorenoReyes2">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Induction of dietary selenium and/or iodine deficiency in rodents, however, fails to replicate many of the clinical features of Kashin-Beck disease, while showing only modest effects on skeletal growth and bone volume <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000616-Ren1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000616-MorenoReyes2">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>.

Values in the 5 ng/ml range are observed in a third of affected individuals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000616-MorenoReyes1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.
