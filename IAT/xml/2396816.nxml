Maintenance of bone mass in adults is a dynamic process that involves a balance of resorption by osteoclasts and formation by osteoblasts. For &#x0003e;100 yr, it has been known that bone is remodeled in accordance with the stresses placed upon it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Frost, 2001</xref>). Unloading of the skeleton decreases osteogenesis, and mechanotransduction is now recognized as one of the major factors regulating skeletal mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Robling et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Nucleotides, such as ATP, are thought to be key mediators in the response of bone cells to mechanical stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dixon and Sims, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Robling et al., 2006</xref>). Many cells release ATP when subjected to stretch or fluid shear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Romanello et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Genetos et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Riddle et al., 2007</xref>). Extracellular ATP can then signal through P2 nucleotide receptors present on various cell types including osteoblasts. There are two subtypes of P2 receptors, P2X (ligand-gated cation channels) and P2Y (G protein&#x02013;coupled receptors; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burnstock, 2007</xref>). Osteoblasts express multiple subtypes of P2X and P2Y receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dixon and Sims, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hoebertz et al., 2000</xref>), but the mechanistic basis of nucleotide effects on bone is not clear.</p><p>P2X7 receptors function not only as nonselective cation channels but can also induce the formation of large membrane pores, which allow passage of molecules with size up to 900 kD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">North, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Khakh and North, 2006</xref>). Pore formation may arise from dilation of the channel caused by recruitment of additional subunits. However, recent evidence supports the possibility that P2X7 receptor activation leads to opening of a distinct pore protein in the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pelegrin and Surprenant, 2006</xref>).</p><p>P2X7 receptors have been implicated in skeletal remodeling and mechanotransduction. <italic>P2rx7</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice exhibit decreased periosteal bone formation in long bones without a difference in length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ke et al., 2003</xref>). Moreover, <italic>P2rx7</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice show reduced osteogenesis in response to mechanical loading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2005</xref>). We have recently shown that activation of P2X7 receptors induces dynamic membrane blebbing in a subpopulation of calvarial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Panupinthu et al., 2007</xref>). Despite these findings that link P2X7 receptors to anabolic effects on the skeleton, it is not known how these receptors influence osteogenesis. Moreover, it is not known whether the phenotype of the <italic>P2rx7</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mouse is caused by an intrinsic defect in osteoblasts or by an indirect effect mediated by other cell types. In this regard, the P2X7 receptor is expressed in cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage, including osteoclasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Naemsch et al., 2001</xref>), as well as some endocrine cell types.</p><p>In the present study, we discovered a cell-autonomous role for P2X7 receptors in bone formation. We show that activation of P2X7 receptors leads to production of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) as well as cyclooxygenase (COX) metabolites. These lipid mediators then up-regulate expression of osteoblast marker genes and stimulate mineralization. Thus, we establish the existence of a P2X7-LPA signaling axis that regulates osteoblast differentiation and osteogenesis during skeletal remodeling and mechanotransduction.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Characteristics of calvariae from <italic>P2rx7</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice</title><p>Mice lacking <italic>P2rx7</italic> exhibit decreased periosteal bone formation in the tibia and insensitivity of the ulna to mechanical loading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ke et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2005</xref>).

In this paper, we found that a subpopulation of marrow stromal cells isolated from rat long bones also expresses functional P2X7 receptors (Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200708037/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200708037/DC1</ext-link>). However, the identity of these subpopulations is not known. Moreover, it has not been established whether the effects of P2X7 receptors on bone formation in vivo are osteoblast autonomous. To investigate these questions, we used a well-characterized bone formation assay using calvarial cells isolated from newborn rodents. In rat calvarial cell cultures, supplementation of the medium with 50 &#x003bc;g/ml ascorbic acid and 2 mM &#x003b2;-glycerophosphate induced osteoblast differentiation and bone nodule formation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity was detected using cytochemical staining (red). Mineral deposition was revealed by staining with silver nitrate solution (von Kossa; black).

Intensity profiles along the dotted lines revealed colocalization of SYTO-13 and propidium iodide in cultures treated with BzATP but not in control. These data establish the presence of functional P2X7 receptors in bone nodule cells. When images were examined in an xy plane at the top of the nodule (in this case, 30 &#x003bc;m above the substrate), robust pore formation was observed in response to BzATP (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>, top).

Expression of the gene encoding osteocalcin (marker of late-stage osteoblast differentiation) was dramatically enhanced by BzATP at 28 d.

Moreover, ALP present on the surface of osteoblasts can hydrolyze nucleotides, causing release of P<sub>i</sub> that promotes mineralization at sufficiently high concentrations.

At concentrations too low to activate P2X7 receptors but sufficient to activate several other P2 receptor subtypes, ATP stimulates the proliferation of osteoblast-like cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shimegi, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nakamura et al., 2000</xref>) and activates the early growth response protein Egr-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pines et al., 2003</xref>). Moreover, ATP and UTP at low concentrations have been reported to inhibit bone nodule formation by rat calvarial osteoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hoebertz et al., 2002</xref>), an effect which is mediated by P2Y2 receptors and the release of pyrophosphate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Orriss et al., 2007</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Regulation of gene expression by P2X7 receptors during osteogenesis</title><p>Characterization of mice lacking genes encoding Runx2 and osterix has established the roles of these transcription factors as master regulators of osteoblast differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ducy et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nakashima et al., 2002</xref>). <italic>Runx2</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice also exhibit a defect in the differentiation of hypertrophic chondrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Enomoto et al., 2000</xref>).

Runx2 functions upstream of osterix and can directly regulate its expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nishio et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, it is likely that P2X7 receptors up-regulate expression of osterix and promote osteoblast differentiation downstream of Runx2 or via effects on Runx2 activity that can be regulated by phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ge et al., 2007</xref>). Moreover, in <italic>P2rx7</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> calvarial cell cultures, we observed down-regulation of the gene encoding osteocalcin, which is known to be regulated by osterix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nakashima et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>We found that deletion of <italic>P2rx7</italic> not only suppresses osteoblast differentiation but enhances expression of the adipocyte markers PPAR&#x003b3; and lipoprotein lipase.

Thus, it appears that activation of P2X7 receptors directs cells toward the osteoblast lineage.

LPA is a soluble mediator that acts on G protein&#x02013;coupled receptors, five of which, LPA1&#x02013;5, are currently identified in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anliker and Chun, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lee et al., 2006</xref>). LPA binds to its receptors on cells of the osteoblast lineage and subserves many functions, such as promoting proliferation, inducing migration, and regulating morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grey et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Masiello et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Panupinthu et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>It is possible that the role of LPA in osteogenesis has not been recognized previously because LPA is abundant in serum used to supplement media for in vitro bone formation assays. Moreover, production of LPA may explain previous reports of apparently anomalous responses to P2X7 receptor activation in other systems. For example, heterologous expression of P2X7 receptors in lymphoid and other cell types confers the ability to grow in the absence of serum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baricordi et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adinolfi et al., 2005</xref>), possibly because of the production of LPA.</p><p>Activation of PLA<sub>2</sub> is a key step in the production of LPA as well as the formation of eicosanoids. In the present study, we showed that the COX pathway is involved in P2X7-induced osteogenesis in concert with LPA receptor signaling. In keeping with our findings, bone marrow&#x02013;derived osteoblasts exhibit reduced osterix expression in the absence of the gene encoding COX-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhang et al., 2002</xref>).

However, studies of marker gene expression indicated that these receptors regulate the differentiation of less mature cells. In this regard, LPA and eicosanoids produced in response to activation of P2X7 receptors on mature osteoblasts may act as autocrine factors on the same cells. In addition, these mediators could act as paracrine factors to stimulate the differentiation of less mature cells in the surrounding region. Collectively, we have identified two lipid signaling pathways, involving LPA and eicosanoids, underlying P2X7-induced osteogenesis.</p></sec><sec><title>Physiological relevance of P2X7-induced osteogenesis</title><p>ATP is released from bone cells in vitro through constitutive and inducible mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buckley et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Genetos et al., 2005</xref>). In <italic>P2rx7</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, osteogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ke et al., 2003</xref>) and anabolic responses to mechanical loading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2005</xref>) are impaired, indicating that release of ATP into the bone extracellular fluid occurs in vivo. Our present data are consistent with release of endogenous ATP stimulating osteogenesis in vitro. In this regard, it has been shown that the differentiation of rat calvarial cells is accompanied by a fivefold increase in cytosolic ATP content at 10&#x02013;14 d (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Komarova et al., 2000</xref>). However, the concentration of ATP in the extracellular compartment depends upon the balance between the release of ATP and its degradation by ectonucleotidases. Therefore, it is conceivable that constitutive ATP release in vivo is insufficient to activate P2X7 receptors, whereas enhanced release arising from mechanical stimulation is sufficient to trigger P2X7 signaling.</p><p>In keeping with a role for P2X7 in mechanotransduction, differences in osteogenesis in <italic>P2rx7</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice are most noticeable at sites in long bones that experience large mechanical strain caused by weight bearing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ke et al., 2003</xref>). It is known that osteogenesis on periosteal surfaces correlates with applied stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Robling et al., 2006</xref>). In this paper, we characterized an additional defect in the <italic>P2rx7</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mouse involving impaired sutural bone growth. Tensile forces caused by intracranial pressure are thought to trigger the growth of bone at sutures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hou et al., 2007</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that mechanical strain induces local release of ATP, which then activates P2X7 receptors on cells of osteoblast lineage, inducing osteogenesis.</p><p>In summary, we propose that the P2X7-LPA axis, together with eicosanoid signaling, promotes osteogenesis. It is well established that release of the endogenous P2X7 agonist ATP is stimulated by fluid shear and mechanical deformation of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Romanello et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Genetos et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Riddle et al., 2007</xref>).
