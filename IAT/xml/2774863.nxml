Cervical cancer is the leading cause of death from cancer in many low-resource countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The lack of preventive strategies, early diagnostic methods, and effective therapies to treat recurrent cervical tumors creates a pressing need to understand its pathogenesis and to identify molecular markers and targets for diagnosis as well as therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The unlimited growth and the metastasis are the important traits of the tumor, are the main causes of cancer-related death induced by the failure of treatment of cervical cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. However, the factors that promote malignant transformation and growth in cervical carcinoma remain largely unknown.</p><p>The complement system has been characterised extensively, both biochemically and functionally. When complement components are deposited on host cells, complement regulating factors protect autologous cells from complement mediated cytotoxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Antibody-mediated complement-dependent killing of tumor cells is not a very efficient effector mechanism, due to the overexpression of complement regulatory proteins on tumor cells, which are protected from complement attack in this way. Decay-accelerating factor (DAF) and membrane cofactor protein (MCP) function as cell surface regulators that serve to protect self cells from attack by autologous complement. The two proteins complement each other in that DAF acts to accelerate the decay of the classical and alternative C3 convertases (C4b2a and C3bBb) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] while MCP functions as a cofactor for the factor I-mediated cleavage of cell-bound C3b and C4b [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Although both proteins have been studied extensively, little is known about whether and, if so, how they cooperate on cervical cancer cells surface. Therefore, our present study aimed to investigate the expression of DAF, MCP and to assess effect of the protein on cervical cancer cells survival.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Reagents</title><p>Human cervical cancer cell lines ME180 (The level of DAF and MCP in ME180 was the maximal expression [see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>]) was provided by China Centre for Type Culture Collection.

Local ethical approval was obtained before commencing this study and, as appropriate, tissue was collected with informed consent.</p></sec><sec><title>Human cervical cancer cell line culture and DNA transfection</title><p>The human cervical cancer cells were propagated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% Fatal Calf Serum (FCS), 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 &#x003bc;g/ml streptomycin, 10% unnecessary amino acid at 37&#x000b0;C in a 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>incubator. Cells used in experiments were from 5 to 7 passages. Lipofectin- and oligofectamine-transfection of shRNA was performed according to the manufacturer's recommendations. Briefly, to transfect tumor cells of one well of a six-well plate, each 500 pmol shRNA and 10 &#x003bc;l lipofectin were diluted in 750 &#x003bc;l OptiMEM. After preincubation of the lipofectin solution for 45 min at 37&#x000b0;C, both solution were mixed and incubated for additional 15 min at room temperature. The lipofectin/shRNA mixture was subsequently overlaid onto the cells and incubated for 2 h. Finally, 1 ml growth medium (20% FCS) per well was added for further cultivation of the tumor cells. Reporter gene activities were normalized to total protein, and all results represented the average of triplicate experiments.</p></sec><sec><title>Construction of DAF shRNA-expressing plasmid vector</title><p>The complementary oligonucleotides encoded a hairpin structure with a 19-mer stem derived from the target site, in this experiment, the targeted short hairpin RNA (shRNA) sequences for DAF were CTC CAC TGG ACA GAG CTG CC and MCP were GCG CGG CGC GGA AGA CGC TG. Two complementary domains were separated by a 9-bp loop sequence. Near the 3' end of the shRNA template was a 6 nucleotide poly (T) tract recognized as a RNA pol III termination signal. The 5' end of the two oligonucleotides was BamHI and Hind III restriction site overhung. The vectors of DAF and MCP shRNA-expressing plasmid were constructed by using pGenesil-1 as the vector backbone. The shRNA synthesized and annealed was ligated into the BamHI and Hind III site of the pGenesil-1 expression vector. At the same time, we chose an unrelated gene shRNA as a negative control.</p></sec><sec><title>Western blot analysis</title><p>The cells were collected with sample buffer. Whole cell lysates (50 &#x003bc;g) for each sample were subjected to electrophoresis in 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gels. Thereafter, the protein was blotted onto a PVDF membrane. Primary antibodies against DAF, MCP and &#x003b2;-actin were used according to the manufacturer's recommedations. After washing the membrane, the second antibody (HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG) was used for the detection of DAF, MCP and &#x003b2;-actin. The bands were visualized by the ECL detection system with 5 to 10 min exposure after washing the membrane. &#x003b2;-actin was used as a protein loading control.</p></sec><sec><title>C3-deposition</title><p>ME180 cells were incubated and subsequently sensitized by incubation with a rabbit polyclonal anti-ME180 antiserum (diluted 1/5) for 20 min on ice.

Due to the expression of membrane-bound complement regulatory proteins, complement deposition on neoplastic cells is limited and therefore not sufficient to induce potent tumour cell killing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Silencing of complement regulatory proteins has been shown to sensitize tumour cells to complement attack [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Therefore, we applied a shRNA strategy to inhibit specifically the expression of DAF and MCP aiming at better employment of complement for tumour cell destruction.</p><p>Numerous studies have been performed on the complement regulatory proteins in primary tumors and in tumor cell lines, in an attempt to clarify their significance to cancer immunoresistance. The fact that most cancers, independent of their tissue origin, express at least two if not three complement regulatory proteins, is perhaps not surprising considering the wide tissue distribution of DAF and MCP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Li et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] examined colorectal and gastric carcinomas and osteosarcoma and found increased expression of DAF, whereas Kiso et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] found increased expression of both DAF and MCP in intestinal type gastric carcinoma. In ovarian cancer, DAF and MCP were more heterogeneously expressed and resistance to complement correlated in these cells with high level of DAF and MCP expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In this study, we detected the expression of DAF and MCP protein in cervical cancer tissue by Western blot. Increasing changes in DAF and MCP protein were observed, the expression of DAF and MCP were significantly increased in human cervical cancer tissue compared with surrounding non-neoplastic tissues, Meanwhile, a further significant decrease of C3b deposition could be demonstrated in human cervical cancer tissues. This finding suggested that DAF and MCP may play an important role in survival of human cervical cancer cells.</p><p>Although DAF and MCP each have been studied extensively, no investigations have focused on whether the two proteins interact in providing optimal protection of self cells from autologous complement despite the fact that nearly all cells express both proteins. Using the above experimental system with incorporated DAF and MCP in ME180 cells, we demonstrated that the two regulators work synergistically on the cell surface in preventing alternative pathway-mediated C3b deposition. The magnitude of the inhibition of C3b uptake in the presence of the two proteins compared to each protein individually was striking. At higher concentrations of the proteins, this cooperative inhibition reached 53-72% as compared to 0-11% for each protein when the proteins were incorporated individually at the same concentrations.</p><p>Functional studies were performed to evaluate complement resistance of tumour cells after shRNA-mediated knock-down of DAF and/or MCP expression. The most striking effects were found that CDC was increased about 67% after inhibition of DAF and MCP; 39% and 36% increased CDC were apparent in MCP or DAF-deficient ME180 cells respectively. In contrast to the DAF and MCP shRNA approach, silencing DAF or MCP by shRNA had only a weak effect on ME180 cells and negative shRNA had no effect at all. It therefore appears that, in human cervical tumours, synergistically silencing DAF and MCP may be more effectively inhibit complement-mediated cytotoxicity.</p><p>The expression of DAF and MCP were significantly increased in human cervical cancer tissue. This finding suggested that DAF and MCP may play important roles in the survival of the human cervical cancer cells. According to our study (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A, B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>), Cooperative inhibition the expression of DAF and MCP genes might decrease viability, migration and proliferation of ME180 cells. DAF and MCP may protect tumor from accidental injury by activated complement, also confer resistance on cancer cells. It seemed that DAF and MCP promotes cell viability, migraton and proliferation, even though the exact mechanism should be studied further. In the future trial we should provide a detailed analysis of complement regulatory protein expression on HPV infected and not infected human cervical cancer cells. We should also examine HPV infected and not infected premalignant cervical lesions and primary cervical squamous carcinomas to determine whether changes in the expression of these proteins are associated with the development of cervical disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, we were able to identify potent shRNA for efficient down-regulation of DAF and MCP expression on tumour cells. Knock-down of both surface-regulators clearly sensitized tumour cells to complement attack. This has been proved by analysis of complement-mediated cytotoxicity and also by investigation of C3b-deposition. The present data indicated that synergistical silencing DAF and MCP significantly decreased the human cervical cancer cell viability, migraton and proliferation. These data indicated that combined DAF and MCP shRNA described in this study may offer an additional alternative to improve the efficacy of antibody-and complement-based cancer immunotherapy in the future.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.
