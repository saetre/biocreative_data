However, their structures are poorly understood. Here, we analyzed the architecture of P2X receptors using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) microscopy and direct structure determination using electron microscopy. FRET efficiency measurements indicated that the distance between the C-terminal tails of P2X<sub>4</sub> receptors was 5.6 nm. Single particle analysis of purified P2X<sub>4</sub> receptors was used to determine the three-dimensional structure at a resolution of 21&#x000c5;<sub>;</sub> the orientation of the particle with respect to the membrane was assigned by labeling the intracellular C termini with 1.8-nm gold particles and the carbohydrate-rich ectodomain with lectin. We found that human P2X<sub>4</sub> is a globular torpedo-like molecule with an approximate volume of 270 nm<sup>3</sup> and a compact propeller-shaped ectodomain. In this structure, the distance between the centers of the gold particles was 6.1 nm, which closely matches FRET data. Thus, our data provide the first views of the architecture, shape, and size of single P2X receptors, furthering our understanding of this important family of ligand-gated ion channels.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><label>*</label><p>This work was supported, in whole or in part, by the <grant-sponsor>National Institutes of Health</grant-sponsor> (to B.

They are found mostly on the plasma membrane, but in some species such as <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> may also fulfill physiological functions within intracellular membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>). They are the third major superfamily of ligand-gated ion channels; however, in contrast to other cationic channel superfamilies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>), very little is known about their three-dimensional structure.</p><p>The topology of P2X receptors is well defined; each monomer subunit is predicted to possess intracellular N and C termini, two transmembrane-spanning domains, and a large ectodomain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>). The functional channel unit is thought to be a trimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>), a feature that is shared with acid-sensing ion channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>). A low resolution structural study of the rat P2X<sub>2</sub> isoform has been published; electron microscopy of single particles gave rise to a structure with a volume of &#x0223c;1200 nm<sup>3</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>). However, the orientation of the molecule was not assigned, and there was no independent evidence to verify the dimensions. Moreover, atomic force microscopy (AFM)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4">3</xref> studies suggest a smaller molecular volume of 490 nm<sup>3</sup>; however, these studies modeled the channel as a flat spherical cap with a height of 2.9 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>). Because the thickness of the plasma membrane is &#x0223c;7 nm, this implies that the AFM studies reported on molecules in a squashed conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>). Thus, the available data do not provide a consistent or satisfying view of the shape, architecture, or size of P2X receptors.</p><p>To further our structural knowledge of P2X receptors and to address the above discrepancies in estimates of molecular volume and size, we have explored two parallel experimental approaches. First, we measured the efficiency of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between subunits within homomeric P2X receptors bearing yellow (YFP) or cyan (CFP) fluorescent protein tags at their C termini. Extensive previous studies by us and others have employed green fluorescent protein (GFP)-labeled P2X receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>), demonstrating that tagging P2X<sub>2</sub>, P2X<sub>4</sub>, and P2X<sub>5</sub> receptors on the C termini with GFP does not affect receptor function. Second, we overexpressed P2X<sub>4</sub> in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells and purified the trimeric form to homogeneity. We used single particle analysis and domain-specific labeling to generate the three-dimensional structure of human P2X<sub>4</sub> at a resolution of 21 &#x000c5;, oriented with respect to the lipid bilayer.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><p><italic>Molecular and Cell Biology</italic>&#x02014;HEK293 or HEK293T cells transiently expressing the appropriate wild-type and fluorescently labeled P2X receptor subunits were used. Some cDNAs were available from previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>), and others were generated using standard cloning procedures. The resulting plasmids were verified by sequencing (P2X<sub>1</sub>-P2X<sub>7</sub>, all tagged with either CFP or YFP). The plasmids were propagated in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> DH5&#x003b1;. The plasmid encoding human P2X<sub>4</sub> with a C-terminal EYMPME tag has been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>). Human P2X<sub>4</sub> containing a C-terminal decahistidine tag was generated from this construct by PCR. HEK293 cells (obtained from American Type Culture Collection) were maintained in 75-cm<sup>2</sup> cell culture flasks (Corning) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/nutrient mixture F-12 with Glutamax (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were grown in a humidified atmosphere of 95% air and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> at 37 &#x000b0;C in a cell culture incubator. The cells were split 1 in 10 when confluence reached 60-90%, which was generally every 4 days. Cells were prepared for transfection by plating onto 6-well plates at the time of splitting, 3-4 days before transfection. They were transfected at &#x0223c;60% confluence. For transient expression in HEK293 cells, we used 0.5-1 &#x003bc;g of plasmid cDNA and Effectene transfection reagent (Qiagen Inc.) for each well of a 6-well plate. The manufacturer's instructions were followed, with 4 &#x003bc;l of enhancer and 10 &#x003bc;l of Effectene were used for each transfection. The transfection efficiency was 40-60%. The HEK293 stable cell line constitutively expressing human P2X<sub>4</sub>-His<sub>10</sub> was generated using electroporation and selection with 400 &#x003bc;g/ml G418 (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) for 14 days in 15-cm culture dishes. Single colonies were isolated using sterile greased stainless steel rings, trypsin-treated, and transferred to 24-well plates. Expression of P2X<sub>4</sub>-His<sub>10</sub> was verified by Western blotting according to standard protocols, and the highest expressing clone was selected for overexpression.</p><p><italic>Epifluorescence FRET Microscopy</italic>&#x02014;We have previously described the setup (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>). We used an Olympus BX50 microscope equipped with a Peltier cooled (-15 &#x000b0;C) Imago CCD camera (640 &#x000d7; 480 pixels, each pixel 9.9 &#x000d7; 9.9 &#x003bc;m), epifluorescence condenser, control unit (containing ISC and PDC boards), and a Polychrome IV monochromator (all from Till Photonics). The light from the monochromator was led to the microscope through a quartz fiber light guide. The hardware was controlled by a personal computer, an appropriate frame grabber (TILL Photonics), and macros driven by TILLvisION Version 3.3 software. The cells were viewed with a 40&#x000d7; water immersion objective lens with a numerical aperture of 0.8 (Olympus). We used the following filters for acquiring CFP or YFP images (all from Glen Spectra, Stanmore, UK; order is dichroic, emitter in nanometers): CFP (455DRLP, 480AF30) and YFP (525DRLP, 545AF35). To photodestroy the YFP, we used 525 nm light from the monochromator and a 525DRLP dichroic.</p><p><italic>Electrophysiology</italic>&#x02014;HEK293 cells were used for recordings 24-48 h post-transfection. Cells were gently mechanically dispersed and plated onto glass coverslips 2-12 h before use. We included this step (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>) to ensure adequate voltage clamp during reversal potential measurements from single spherical cells. The extracellular recording solution comprised 150 m<sc>m</sc> NaCl, 1 m<sc>m</sc> MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 (or 0.1) m<sc>m</sc> CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 m<sc>m</sc> HEPES, and 10 m<sc>m</sc> glucose (pH 7.4), and the pipette solution comprised 154 m<sc>m</sc> NaCl (or CsCl or CsF), 11 m<sc>m</sc> EGTA, and 10 m<sc>m</sc> HEPES. Whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings were made with &#x0223c;4-megaohm borosilicate glass electrodes (World Precision Instruments) using an Axopatch-1D or Axopatch 200 amplifier controlled by a computer running pCLAMP 8.1 or 10 software via a Digidata 1322 interface (Molecular Devices). Data were filtered at 0.5-2 kHz and digitized at 1-5 kHz. Drugs were applied to single cells by pressure ejection using a Picospritzer (Intracell Ltd.) or in the bathing medium, which flowed at 2-3 ml/min. For pressure application (&#x0223c;20 p.s.i., 1 p.s.i. = 6.89 kilopascals), we used 2-4-megaohm pipettes as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>); solution exchange occurred in &#x0223c;10 ms.</p><p><italic>Protein Purification</italic>&#x02014;Membrane fractions were prepared from 2.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>8</sup> cells and solubilized in phosphate-buffered saline containing 1% (w/v) &#x003b2;-<sc>d</sc>-dodecyl maltoside (DDM; Merck, Nottingham, UK) and protease inhibitors (Complete-EDTA, Roche Applied Science). Samples were diluted into buffer A (150 m<sc>m</sc> NaCl, 20 m<sc>m</sc> sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), 150 m<sc>m</sc> imidazole, and 0.1% (w/v) DDM) and incubated overnight at 4 &#x000b0;C with nickel-Sepharose beads (Amersham Biosciences, Chalfont St. Giles, UK) to capture His-tagged protein. Beads were packed into columns and washed with 20 column volumes of buffer A; 50% pure His-tagged protein was eluted in buffer A containing 500 m<sc>m</sc> imidazole.</p><p><italic>Purification of P2X<sub>4</sub> Trimers</italic>&#x02014;1-ml protein-containing fractions from the nickel affinity column were concentrated using 50-kDa cutoff filters (Millipore, Watford, UK) and separated by perfluorooctanoic acid (PFO)-PAGE according to published methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>). For preparative PFO-PAGE, samples were loaded onto 1.5-mm thick 8% (w/v) polyacrylamide gels and run at 4 &#x000b0;C at 10 mA. P2X<sub>4</sub> trimers (150-180 kDa) were excised from nonstained gels and placed into 2-ml D-tube dialysis units (Merck), and protein was eluted at 60 V for 2 h at 4 &#x000b0;C. Protein samples were diafiltered into phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% (w/v) DDM.</p><p><italic>Gold and Lectin Labeling</italic>&#x02014;For gold labeling, purified P2X<sub>4</sub>-His<sub>10</sub> in 0.1% DDM was incubated for 10 min at room temperature with a 10:1 molar excess of 1.8-nm diameter nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA)-Nanogold particles (Nanoprobes, Yaphank, NY). Samples were adsorbed onto grids and washed with Nanogold suspension to prevent unbinding of the protein-associated gold particles. For lectin labeling, purified P2X<sub>4</sub>-His<sub>10</sub> in 0.1% DDM was mixed with <italic>Lens culinaris</italic> lectin (Sigma, Poole, UK) at a molar ratio of 1:1 and immediately applied to grids. After transmission electron microscopy and image processing, 1966 gold-labeled P2X<sub>4</sub>-His<sub>10</sub> particles (in 48 &#x000d7; 48 pixel boxes) and 2862 lectin-labeled particles (in 64 &#x000d7; 64 pixel boxes) were manually selected. Three-dimensional structures were generated using the refined P2X<sub>4</sub> structure as a starting model with eight rounds of iterative refinement.</p><p><italic>Structure Determination by Electron Microscopy and Single Particle Analysis</italic>&#x02014;Protein samples (20 &#x003bc;g/ml) were adsorbed onto glow-discharged carbon-coated copper grids and negatively stained with 2% (w/v) uranyl acetate. Transmission electron microscopy images were recorded on Kodak SO-163 film at a calibrated magnification of &#x000d7;43,500 using a Tecnai 10 electron microscope operating at 100 kV. Images were digitized using a UMAX 2000 Powerlook scanner at 1200 pixels/inch, providing a specimen level increment of 4.87 &#x000c5;/pixel. EMAN software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>) was used to manually select, filter, and process 6826 particles in 48 &#x000d7; 48 pixel boxes. Using the command &#x0201c;startcsym,&#x0201d; we compared the best match of the two-dimensional reference-free class averages with symmetrized classes using C2, C3, C4, C5, and C6 symmetry (see <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>E</italic></xref>). C3 symmetry provided the best fit to the data, and so a start model was generated from a manually selected set of reference-free class averages with C3 symmetry applied using the command &#x0201c;start-Any&#x0201d;; this model was refined by 12 rounds of iterative projection matching using the &#x0201c;refine&#x0201d; command. Fourier shell correlation analysis of the final iteration using comparison of structures generated from even- or odd-numbered particles (&#x0201c;eotest&#x0201d;; see <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>D</italic></xref>) indicated a final resolution of &#x0223c;21 &#x000c5;. Structures were displayed at volume shells corresponding to at least 3 S.D. values above the mean density.</p><p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>FIGURE 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Functional analysis of wild-type and YFP-tagged P2X receptors.</bold> The <italic>black traces</italic> show agonist-evoked currents for wild-type homomeric P2X<sub>1</sub>-P2X<sub>5</sub> and P2X<sub>7</sub> receptors.

The photodestruction of the YFP proceeds with kinetics similar to the dequenching of the donor (see <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>C</italic></xref>), and plotting the photorecovery <italic>versus</italic> photodestruction yields a linear plot (see <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). We used such linear plots and extrapolated to 100% acceptor photodestruction to calculate the maximum donor dequenching for epifluorescence microscopy: <italic>e</italic> is given by the <italic>y</italic> axis intercept. In a specific set of experiments, we also calculated FRET <italic>e</italic> from just one point of photodestruction and extrapolated to 100% destruction.

In the case of CFP and YFP, this is &#x0223c;50 &#x000c5; (5 nm). Notably, <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub> contains a term for the fluorophore dipole orientation factor (&#x003ba;<sup>2</sup>), which at 2/3 assumes random tumbling of the fluorophores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>). This means that <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub> and the distance measurements reported here assume that the fluorophores adopt all spherically random orientations. Given that we do not know the relative orientation of the fluorophores on P2X<sub>2</sub> channels, assuming a &#x003ba;<sup>2</sup> value of 2/3 seems appropriate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>). When interpreting FRET <italic>e</italic> measurements in terms of distance, it is important to consider that in the case of CFP and YFP the fluorophore is buried in the center of a &#x003b2;-can with a width of 30 &#x000c5; and a length of 45 &#x000c5; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>). A further consideration is that we do not know the absolute ratio of donors to acceptors during FRET at the single molecule level. We have previously considered these issues in depth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>). For the FRET experiments, we chose plasma membrane regions of interest post hoc. Our criteria were that regions of interest (i) were bright in both CFP and YFP images; (ii) located at the edge, presumably plasma membrane of the cell; (iii) did not change or drift in intensity during the control period; and (iv) remained in focus during the entire experiment.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS</title><p><italic>Tagged P2X Receptors Are Functional</italic>&#x02014;In past work, it has been demonstrated that P2X<sub>2</sub>, P2X<sub>4</sub>, and P2X<sub>5</sub> receptors tagged on their C termini with GFP function like their wild-type counterparts in terms of ATP-evoked currents and ATP sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>). We started by recording ATP-evoked currents from HEK cells expressing CFP- and YFP-tagged P2X receptors and compared the responses with wild-type P2X receptors (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Receptor function was preserved for all receptors and the kinetics of their activation, desensitization, and deactivation were not detectably affected for some receptors. Below and in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>, we present a detailed characterization of these parameters for P2X<sub>4</sub> receptors. Thus, as expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>), YFP-tagged P2X<sub>1</sub> and P2X<sub>3</sub> receptors desensitized rapidly (&#x0003c;1 s); P2X<sub>2</sub> and P2X<sub>4</sub> receptors desensitized slowly (over tens of seconds); and P2X<sub>5</sub> receptors expressed poorly (100 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> ATP used for activation). In the case of P2X<sub>7</sub> receptors, we recorded large variability in 30 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> benzoyl-ATP-evoked currents. Thus, in the case of the wild-type or YFP-tagged receptors, the currents from single cells were either monophasic or biphasic and displayed slow and variable kinetics (three exemplar traces are shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). These cell-to-cell differences for P2X<sub>7</sub> receptors have been well documented and may represent permeability changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>), variable phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>), interactions with pannexin-1 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref>), or modulation by calmodulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref37">37</xref>). The focus of this study was not P2X<sub>7</sub> receptors, so we cannot yet discriminate between these possibilities. The key point here is that the wild-type and YFP-tagged P2X<sub>7</sub> receptors show similar overall responses, but in future work it will be important to determine the most critical factors that contribute to P2X<sub>7</sub> response variability. These overall features show that YFP tagging does not largely affect the functional properties of homomeric P2X receptors or peak currents (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). We did not carry out an extensive pharmacological analysis of each tagged receptor because this was not the focus of this study and also because this has been reported already with GFP-tagged P2X<sub>2</sub>, P2X<sub>4</sub>, and P2X<sub>5</sub> receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>). Because the structure of CFP and YFP is similar to that of GFP and because they differ by only a few residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>), it is reasonable to surmise that receptors that can be tagged with GFP can also tolerate CFP and YFP without altering function.

Overall, our data with CFP- and YFP-tagged receptors reproduce past work with GFP-tagged P2X<sub>4</sub> receptors, where it was demonstrated that GFP did not affect P2X<sub>4</sub> responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>).</p><p><italic>Receptor-specific FRET for Homomeric P2X Receptors</italic>&#x02014;To measure FRET efficiency (<italic>e</italic>), we studied homomeric P2X receptors tagged with CFP and YFP and expressed in single living HEK cells.

We measured a decrease in P2X<sub>4</sub>-YFP fluorescence intensity with a time course that followed that of the P2X<sub>4</sub>-CFP increase when the acceptor YFP was optically destroyed with 525 nm light (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>C</italic></xref>). Maximum P2X<sub>4</sub>-CFP photorecovery when P2X<sub>4</sub>-YFP was 100% photodestroyed corresponds to FRET <italic>e</italic>, which in the case of P2X<sub>4</sub>-CFP/P2X<sub>4</sub>-YFP channels near the cell perimeter was 30 &#x000b1; 5% (<italic>n</italic> = 8). We repeated these experiments to establish the level of FRET noise that arises as CFP and YFP randomly approach a distance of &#x0223c;20-70 &#x000c5; within the cell.

The donor dequenching plots are presented in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>. These experiments clearly establish that FRET <italic>e</italic> for receptors in plasma membrane regions is subunit-specific.

In the case of tagged P2X<sub>6</sub> receptors, only whole-cell regions were examined because these do not express in the plasma membrane, but are instead retained within intracellular membranes (see &#x0201c;Results&#x0201d;). <italic>I</italic>, the <italic>left panel</italic> shows a plot of the F&#x000f6;rster equation relating FRET <italic>e</italic> (<italic>y axis</italic>) and interfluorophore distance (<italic>x axis</italic>), with FRET <italic>e</italic> data for all homomeric P2X receptors superimposed.

In interpreting these data, it is important to remember that the orientation factor &#x003ba;<sup>2</sup> is taken as 2/3 and assumes random tumbling as discussed by us and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>). <italic>aa</italic>, amino acids.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="zbc0400850160003"></graphic></fig></p><p>We explored the relationship of the experimentally determined FRET <italic>e</italic> for P2X receptors in the membrane to the dependence of FRET between CFP and YFP and interfluorophore distance (in angstroms). For this comparison, we used the F&#x000f6;rster equation and an <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub> value of 50 &#x000c5;. The graph in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>I</italic></xref> plots FRET <italic>e</italic> for all homomeric P2X receptors along with how FRET <italic>e</italic> falls (as 1/<italic>R</italic><sup>6</sup>) with distance between the chromophores of CFP and YFP. The numbers next to the data points indicate the length of the cytosolic C-terminal tail for each of the receptors. From these data, a trend is readily apparent. The FRET <italic>e</italic> for P2X receptors (and thus one assumes the interfluorophore distance) is related to the length of the C-terminal tail. For instance, the channels with the shortest C-terminal tails display the lowest FRET <italic>e</italic> (<italic>e.g.</italic> P2X<sub>1</sub> and P2X<sub>3</sub>, C-terminal tail lengths of 44 and 42 residues), whereas the channels with the longest C-terminal tails display the highest FRET <italic>e</italic> (<italic>e.g.</italic> P2X<sub>2</sub> and P2X<sub>7</sub>, C-terminal tail lengths of 118 and 238 residues). P2X<sub>5</sub> sits intermediate in this trend, consistent with its C-terminal tail being of intermediate length (96 residues). P2X<sub>4</sub> with a C-terminal tail length of 33 residues is the receptor that is slightly shifted in the overall trend. Overall, our data show a surprising trend between FRET <italic>e</italic> for P2X receptors and the C-terminal tail length, implying that the distance between the tips of the C-terminal tails for P2X receptors near the membrane is larger than at the tips of those with longer tails. Put another way, the cytosolic domain of P2X<sub>2</sub> and P2X<sub>7</sub> receptors narrows from its origins at the plasma membrane to its tip (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>J</italic></xref>). Using this method, the distance between the C-terminal tails of functional P2X<sub>4</sub> receptors in the plasma membrane of single living cells was calculated to be 5.6 nm.</p><p>All of the FRET experiments shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> were carried out using identical imaging/analysis methods and in parallel to reduce any variability between experiments. In the case of P2X<sub>2</sub>-P2X<sub>6</sub> receptors, the data points were well fit by a straight line (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). However, in the case of P2X<sub>1</sub> and P2X<sub>7</sub> receptors, the linear plots were less esthetically pleasing. We could think of no precise scientific reason to discard these data and present them faithfully in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>. The relevant issue here is whether the FRET <italic>e</italic> estimates for P2X<sub>1</sub> and P2X<sub>7</sub> receptors were adversely affected. To address this, we specifically determined if estimates of FRET <italic>e</italic> were adversely affected by prolonged photodestruction that is needed for the linear plots in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>. We measured FRET <italic>e</italic> for all homomeric P2X receptors from only one point of photodestruction and compared the estimated FRET <italic>e</italic> values with those determined with extensive photodestruction (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, <italic>C</italic> and <italic>D</italic></xref>, and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>). <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref> shows that FRET values agree between these methods. Thus, although there is some variability between P2X receptors in the extent to which the CFP photorecovery is fit by linear functions (compare plots in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>), this does not under- or overestimate FRET <italic>e</italic> values. This is consistent with past work for a variety of FRET constructs, including P2X<sub>2</sub> receptors, where we showed using three-cube linear unmixing that FRET <italic>e</italic> could be reliably estimated by donor dequenching (Figs. <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>).</p><p><fig position="float" id="fig4"><label>FIGURE 4.</label><caption><p><bold>Comparison of P2X receptor FRET by two methods.</bold> The graph shows the relationship between FRET <italic>e</italic> estimates from experiments such as those in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref> when extensive photobleaching was employed (&#x0223c;30 min) and FRET <italic>e</italic> estimates when only 5 min of photodestruction was used.

Our reasoning was 2-fold. First, because FRET is an ensemble measurement and makes a number of assumptions about the fluorophore orientations, a three-dimensional structure could be used to verify the FRET <italic>e</italic> measurements. Second, the estimates of distance by FRET may be used as a &#x0201c;barometer&#x0201d; to ascertain that the P2X<sub>4</sub> structure was of a size appropriate for the channel in the membrane. This is important because the published single particle and AFM studies differ largely on the dimensions of P2X receptors (see the Introduction).</p><p><italic>Functional Expression and Purification of Human P2X<sub>4</sub>-His<sub>10</sub> from HEK Cells</italic>&#x02014;The expression of human P2X<sub>4</sub>-His<sub>10</sub> was verified by Western blotting and compared with that of P2X<sub>4</sub>-EYMPME (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>).

The size of the band was in agreement with that observed by Western blotting, and purity was estimated to be &#x0223c;50%. To purify P2X<sub>4</sub> to homogeneity, we used nondenaturing PFO-PAGE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>), followed by electroelution. When separated by PFO-PAGE, 50% pure P2X<sub>4</sub> presented as three bands corresponding to a monomer (55 kDa), a faint dimer (110 kDa), and a trimer (165 kDa) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>A</italic></xref>). No higher order oligomers were observed. We assumed that the observed monomers and dimers corresponded to immature nonassembled proteins recovered from internal membranes. Trimers were selectively purified by excising bands from preparative nonstained PFO-polyacrylamide gels and eluting protein under an electric field. SDS-PAGE analysis of eluted protein demonstrated the high purity obtained using this purification method (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>B</italic></xref>); the only bands visible on the silver-stained gel corresponded to P2X<sub>4</sub>.

Gold particles were clearly visible, with some classes containing two attached gold particles per trimer.

The distance between the centers of the gold particles was 6.1 nm (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>E</italic></xref>, <italic>black arrow</italic>), which agrees well with the data from FRET experiments (5.6 nm) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>E</italic></xref>, <italic>red arrow</italic>). In confirmation that we had assigned the correct orientation, the lectin-labeled particle clearly displayed two regions of additional protein density per monomer at the propeller end of the molecule (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>F</italic></xref>). The molecular mass of <italic>L. culinaris</italic> lectin tetramers is 49 kDa, but the additional volume observed in the labeled structure was smaller than expected for three tetramers. This is probably because lectin bound to P2X<sub>4</sub><italic>N</italic>-linked glycan chains present at different positions in the ectodomain, and furthermore, flexibility of each glycan chain could also lead to a smearing out of the lectin location. Such variability would lead to some averaging out of the lectin location by single particle analysis so that only the core of the lectin binding to P2X<sub>4</sub> would be observed in the final structure.</p><p>At a threshold of 5.6&#x003c3; above the mean density (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>H</italic></xref>, <italic>light blue inner core</italic>), the human P2X<sub>4</sub> receptor ectodomain displayed cavities with lateral fins running alongside them. This volume threshold corresponds to a molecular mass of 220 kDa and a volume of 270 nm<sup>3</sup>, allowing for one P2X<sub>4</sub> trimer in addition to a detergent micelle (assuming a protein density of 1.35 g/ml and no significant internal cavities within the structure). At 3&#x003c3; above the mean density (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>H</italic></xref>, <italic>dark blue outer core</italic>), the cavities disappeared, and the lateral fins were more pronounced. This density corresponds to a molecular mass of 410 kDa and a volume of 506 nm<sup>3</sup>. Our value for the molecular volume of human P2X<sub>4</sub> of 270 nm<sup>3</sup> is consistent with the value of 409 nm<sup>3</sup> obtained for rat P2X<sub>2</sub> using AFM imaging (trimer masses of 165 kDa for human P2X<sub>4</sub> and 210 kDa for rat P2X<sub>2</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>). The transmembrane domains are most likely shrouded in a torus-shaped detergent micelle, which could explain the bulbous nature of the P2X<sub>4</sub> three-dimensional structure in the region below the fins that we associate with the ectodomain. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that regions of the ectodomain re-enter the transmembrane region and contribute to the protein content of the transmembrane space.</p></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The main results of this study are (<italic>i</italic>) we developed methods to overexpress P2X<sub>4</sub> receptors for structural work; (<italic>ii</italic>) we determined the shape, architecture, and size of a single human P2X receptor; and (<italic>iii</italic>) we verified the dimensions with independent measurements using FRET. We initially chose to work on all homomeric P2X receptors using FRET microscopy and measured the proximity between their C-terminal tail tips at 5.3-6.4 nm. We then focused on P2X<sub>4</sub> receptors for electron microscopy because of its favorable expression profile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">43</xref>). The single particle studies provide data on the overall shape and size of a single P2X receptor and on the approximate distance between the C-terminal tail tips at 6.1 nm. The agreement for proximity between FRET and electron microscopy attests to the reliability of the methods. F&#x000f6;rster theory of energy transfer makes several assumptions about the mutual orientation of the fluorophores (notably the &#x003ba;<sup>2</sup> value). In the usual case, &#x003ba;<sup>2</sup> is taken to equal 2/3, which implies adoption of all spherically random orientations between the fluorophores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>). The agreement for distance estimates by FRET and single particle imaging suggests that FRET is useful as a molecular caliper for membrane-embedded P2X channels. This is consistent with previous pioneering FRET studies by Nashmi <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref>) of neuronal nicotinic receptors and comparisons of distance to the structural model of the muscle nicotinic receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref>).</p><p><fig position="float" id="fig6"><label>FIGURE 6.</label><caption><p><bold>Domain-specific labeling of P2X<sub>4</sub> receptor trimers.</bold><italic>A</italic>, particle field from an electron micrograph of negatively stained (2% (w/v) uranyl acetate) single particles of human P2X<sub>4</sub>-His<sub>10</sub> following a 10-min incubation with 1.8-nm diameter Ni-NTA-Nanogold particles.

This is a nontrivial issue because no P2X receptors have been found in bacteria, and there are no other receptors with similar structure based on sequence analysis. This calls for the development of approaches that can be used for the expression and purification of P2X receptors. In this work, we have both developed an efficient expression and purification system for human P2X<sub>4</sub> and significantly improved the quality and resolution of existing structural data available for P2X receptors. Our methods should also enable relatively straightforward purification of larger quantities of human P2X<sub>4</sub> for higher resolution structure studies. Preparative electrophoresis has been used extensively for the purification of membrane protein complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">44</xref>), and in at least one case, this method has yielded sufficient quantities for three-dimensional crystallization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45">45</xref>). The use of our method, by us and others, will allow high resolution structural information on P2X receptors.</p><p>Selective purification by preparative electrophoresis of a band corresponding in apparent molecular mass to a trimeric form of human P2X<sub>4</sub> strongly suggested the application of C3 symmetry in image processing and three-dimensional reconstruction. Since initial pioneering work with Blue native PAGE by Nicke <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>), virtually all recent evidence also indicates that trimers are the functional unit of P2X receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>). In addition, we were able to label the C-terminal His tags on each monomer with 1.8-nm gold particles. Although three gold particles attached to a single trimeric particle were only infrequently observed, probably because of a relatively weak binding or a rapid off-rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">42</xref>), many particles were doubly labeled, and after classification and averaging, a 120&#x000b0; angle was subtended between the two gold labels in the classes corresponding to &#x0201c;face-on&#x0201d; views along the C3 axis of rotational symmetry (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6<italic>C</italic></xref>, <italic>arrows</italic>).</p><p>Labeling of the large, multiply glycosylated ectodomain with plant lectin confirmed that the &#x0201c;propeller&#x0201d;-like domain, previously identified in the low resolution structural analysis as being at the opposite end of the molecule to the Ni-NTA-gold label, probably corresponded to this extracellular region. A composite model based on all the EM data is shown in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>. Note that the expected dimensions of a torus-shaped DDM micelle are indicated, which would leave a relatively small volume at its center corresponding to the transmembrane regions of P2X<sub>4</sub>. The final structure is therefore expected to be torpedo-shaped, with a narrow transmembrane domain and compact ectodomain that does not display a central cavity or pore. Approximate maximum dimensions were 8 nm in diameter and 12 nm along the longest axis, coincident with the C3 symmetry axis. Under our experimental conditions, in which P2X<sub>4</sub> was solubilized in detergent, the position of the membrane-spanning domain could not be accurately determined; however, we have indicated its approximate position in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>. It is probable that the transmembrane domains were protected from the aqueous environment by a detergent micelle, which could possess a molecular mass of in excess of 50 kDa. However, our structure does not inform us about protein organization within the transmembrane region, and it is possible that regions of the ectodomain may form re-entrant loops, increasing the protein content within the transmembrane space. In the model shown in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>, the C-terminal decahistidine tag is positioned close to the start of the membrane-spanning domain, a location that would place it close to the polar headgroup region of the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane.</p><p>Our work represents the first direct structural study of a human P2X receptor, but should be discussed in the light of previous work on rat P2X<sub>2</sub>. Mio <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>) purified rat P2X<sub>2</sub> from an insect cell line and determined a structure by transmission electron microscopy and single particle analysis. Their structure resembled an inverted three-sided pyramid, 21.5 nm in height and 20 nm in side length, corresponding to a molecular volume of &#x0223c;1200 nm<sup>3</sup>; this is 4.5-fold greater than our measurement of 270 nm<sup>3</sup>. The authors stated that their model contained a large, stain-permeable cavity; however, as the orientation of the particle was not assigned, it was not possible to state which portion of the molecule contained the cavity in their experiments. The authors assumed that this portion of their structure corresponded to the ectodomain by comparison with the topology map of the receptor. However, our data clearly show that the ectodomain of human P2X<sub>4</sub> is a highly compact structure, such as has been shown in the recently published structure of the trimeric acid-sensing ion channel 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>). Given the high degree of sequence homology between rat P2X<sub>2</sub> and human P2X<sub>4</sub>, it seems unlikely that the structures at the monomeric level would be so radically different in size and shape. A possible explanation for the discrepancy may be that the rat P2X<sub>2</sub> particles were composed of a higher order quaternary structure. Four trimeric P2X<sub>2</sub> complexes of the dimensions described here could potentially associate into a large complex with tetragonal symmetry. Such a tetramer of trimers, composed of 12 P2X<sub>2</sub> polypeptides, would account for the &#x0223c;4-fold greater volume of the rat P2X<sub>2</sub> particles <italic>versus</italic> expectations and the very large (20-nm side length) overall dimensions of the pyramidal particles. Two additional studies of rat P2X<sub>2</sub> structure have been published. Nakazawa <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>) analyzed single particles of rat P2X<sub>2</sub> using AFM. They found that in the presence of 1 m<sc>m</sc> ATP, particles of &#x0223c;10 nm in diameter were observed, with evidence suggesting the presence of a central pore. The diameter of these particles is more consistent with those observed for human P2X<sub>4</sub> in our study (8-nm diameter along the C3 axis); however, at the resolution of our study, we could not observe a central pore. It is possible that AFM, which measures the surface topography of the specimen, is detecting an indentation in P2X<sub>2</sub> that is not present in P2X<sub>4</sub> or, alternatively, that the negative staining and EM method do not access this surface topography in P2X<sub>4</sub>. Barrera <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>) also imaged rat P2X<sub>2</sub> using AFM. They provided evidence for the trimeric nature of rat P2X<sub>2</sub> by measuring the average angle (120&#x000b0;) between peripheral particles interpreted as antibodies attached to the (three) C termini of their P2X<sub>2</sub> specimen. Their estimate of the volume of the receptor was 409 nm<sup>3</sup>, which is consistent with our measurement for human P2X<sub>4</sub> of 270 nm<sup>3</sup>, allowing for the difference in molecular mass between the two receptor subtypes (165 kDa for human P2X<sub>4</sub> trimers <italic>versus</italic> 210 kDa for rat P2X<sub>2</sub> trimers).</p><p>In summary, we have introduced an efficient method for purification of human P2X<sub>4</sub> that has been overexpressed in human cells. This methodology may be readily applicable to other members of this family and could be of interest for the purification of other membrane proteins where isolation of a single oligomeric form is desirable. This method has allowed us to study the overall structure and topology of P2X<sub>4</sub> and has helped to interpret existing structural data for this unique and intriguing family of nonselective cation channels. Our work has enabled visualization of some global structural features of these receptors and paves the way for future studies. This work should be viewed as an initial and necessary step toward the longer term goal of obtaining high resolution structural information for P2X receptors. From this perspective, it is worth considering that spectacular progress has been made using cryoelectron microscopy studies of nicotinic receptors since initial views of the quaternary structure published in 1985 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref46">46</xref>) to a recent 4 &#x000c5; resolution model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref47">47</xref>).</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Helen Broomhead for assistance with molecular biology and Kyriaki Dossi and Joan Sim for assistance with cell culture.</p></ack><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><citation citation-type="journal">Burnstock, G.
