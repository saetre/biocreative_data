The Kaposi sarcoma- associated herpes virus (KSHV) encodes three chemokines. Two of these, vCCL2 and vCCL3, target the human lymphotactin receptor as an antagonist and a selective agonist, respectively. Therefore these virally endcoded chemokines have the potential to be used as tools in the study of lymphotactin receptor pathways in murine models.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The activities of vCCL2, vCCL3, human lymphotactin (XCL1) and murine lymphotactin (mXCL1) were probed in parallel on the human and murine lymphotactin receptor (XCR1 and mXCR1) using a phosphatidyl-inositol assay. On the human XCR1, vCCL3, mXCL1 and XCL1 acted as agonists. In contrast, only mXCL1 was able to activate the murine lymphotactin receptor. Using the same assay, vCCL2 was able to block the response using any of the three agonists on the humane lymphotactin receptor with IC<sub>50</sub>s of 2&#x02013;3 nM. However, vCCL2 was unable to block the response of mXCL1 through the murine lymphotactin receptor.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study shows that vCCL2 and vCCL3 cannot be used to investigate lymphotactin receptor pathways in murine models. These results also add vCCL2 and vCCL3 to a growing list of viral chemokines with known human chemokine receptor targets, which do not target the corresponding murine receptors. This fits with the observation that viral and endogenous ligands for the same human chemokine receptor tend to have relatively divergent amino-acid sequences, suggesting that these viruses have fine-tuned the design of their chemokines such that the action of the viral encoded chemokines cannot be expected to cross species barriers.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>During the last 15 years, more than 40 chemokines have been identified in the human genome and nearly all have been characterized pharmacologically as agonists and led to the identification of 18 signaling 7TM chemokine receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>Chemokines are 70&#x02013;80 amino acid proteins with a characteric three-dimensional fold, which are involved in guiding and activating distinct leukocyte subsets. Chemokines can be divided into four sub-families on the basis of the pattern and number of the conserved cysteine residues located near their N-terminus, which are involved in disulfide binding formation; the CC-, CXC-, CX<sub>3</sub>C and XC family, respectively. The XC-chemokines have only one cysteine in the N-terminus. Chemokines act through 7TM GPCRs of which we today know ten CC-chemokine receptors (CCR1-10), six CXC-receptors (CXCR1-6), one CX<sub>3</sub>C-receptor (CX<sub>3</sub>CR1) and one XC-receptor (XCR1). The role played by the lymphotactin receptor (XCR1) in the immune system is poorly understood.</p><p>In the same period, seven chemokines encoded by large human DNA viruses have been found by genomic sequence analysis. Most of these have been characterized and have been found to have different pharmacological phenotypes as some target multiple receptors, some only one receptor, some act as agonists, while others act as antagonists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>](Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Chemokines encoded by human viruses and their human and murine chemokine receptor targets.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="center"><bold>Virus</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>Gene</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>Protein</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>human chemokine receptor targets</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>Ref</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>also targeting the corresponding murine chemokine receptor</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>Ref</bold></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center"><bold>CMV</bold></td><td align="center">UL146</td><td align="center">vCXCL1</td><td align="center"><bold>Selective CXCR2 agonist</bold></td><td align="center">11</td><td align="center"><bold>No</bold></td><td align="center">20</td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="center">UL147</td><td align="center">vCXCL2</td><td align="center"><bold>?</bold></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><bold>HHV6</bold><sup>a</sup></td><td align="center">U83B</td><td align="center">vCCL4</td><td align="center"><bold>Selective CCR2 agonist</bold></td><td align="center">9</td><td align="center"><bold>?</bold></td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="center"><bold>HHV8</bold></td><td align="center">K6</td><td align="center">vCCL1 (vMIP-I)</td><td align="center"><bold>Selective CCR8 agonist</bold></td><td align="center">3,5,10</td><td align="center"><bold>Yes</bold></td><td align="center">18</td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="center">K4</td><td align="center">vCCL2 (vMIP-II)</td><td align="center"><bold>Broadspectrum chemokine receptor</bold></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td align="center"><bold>antagonist</bold></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td align="center"><bold>CCR1</bold></td><td align="center">6,7</td><td align="center"><bold>Yes</bold></td><td align="center">19</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td align="center"><bold>CCR2</bold></td><td align="center">6,7</td><td align="center"><bold>Yes</bold></td><td align="center">19</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td align="center"><bold>CCR5</bold></td><td align="center">6,7</td><td align="center"><bold>Yes</bold></td><td align="center">19</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td align="center"><bold>XCR1</bold></td><td align="center">7</td><td align="center"><bold>No</bold></td><td align="center">This paper</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td align="center"><bold>CX3CR1</bold></td><td align="center">7</td><td align="center"><bold>?</bold></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td align="center"><bold>CXCR4</bold></td><td align="center">6,7</td><td align="center"><bold>?</bold></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td><td align="center"><bold>CCR3 agonist</bold></td><td align="center">17</td><td align="center"><bold>?</bold></td><td></td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="center">K4.1</td><td align="center">vCCL3 (vMIP-III)</td><td align="center"><bold>Selective XCR1 agonist</bold></td><td align="center">10</td><td align="center"><bold>No</bold></td><td align="center">This paper</td></tr><tr><td align="center"><bold>MCV</bold></td><td align="center">MC148</td><td align="center">MCC</td><td align="center"><bold>Selective CCR8 antagonist</bold></td><td align="center">7</td><td align="center"><bold>No</bold></td><td align="center">18</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p><sup>a</sup>The protein product from the U83 gene of HHV6A has not been included as its signal sequence include a premature stop codon.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>Obviously viral encoded chemokines are important in the study of viral pathogenesis, but they can also be used as tools in the investigation of specific chemokine receptors. Blocking of chemokine receptor action is important in several assays and immunological models studying the chemokine system. One example is the selective CCR8 antagonist MC148 encoded by the <italic>Molluscuum Contagiosum Virus </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Another example is the broad-spectrum chemokine antagonist vCCL2 encoded by HHV8, which blocks a number of chemokine receptors such as CCR1, CCR2, CCR5, CX3CR1, CXCR4 and the lymphotactin receptor XCR1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Thus vCCL2 has been shown to reduce the inflammatory response in small animal models models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. However, viral-encoded agonists are also useful in the investigation of the role of a chemokine receptor even when the endogenous human ligand has been identified, because they can have greater potency and be more stable than their human counterparts. This is the case for another HHV8 encoded chemokine vCCL3, which was recently found to have a 10-fold higher potency than lymphotactin on the human lymphotactin receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>Thus HHV8 encodes both the only known high-affinty lymphotactin receptor antagonist, vCCL2, as well as the most potent agonist, vCCL3, known to XCR1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Therefore both vCCL2 and vCCL3 are valuable tools in evaluating the role of the lymphotactin receptor. However, when using animal models it is obviously important to characterize these proteins on the specific animal chemokine receptors. Here we report the characterization of the viral-encoded proteins vCCL2 and vCCL3 on the murine lymphotactin receptor done in parallel with the humane XCR1.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Alignment of human, murine and viral ligands for the human and the murine lymphotactin receptor</bold>.

As expected, XCL1, mXCL1 and vCCL3 activated the human lymphotactin receptor in a dose responsive manner (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). As reported earlier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], the potency of vCCL3 (EC<sub>50 </sub>= 3.7 nM) was nearly 10-fold greater than the potency of XCL1 (EC<sub>50 </sub>= 30 nM, assuming Emax equal to that of vCCL3) on the human XCR1 receptor. Interestingly, murine lymphotactin had a 3-fold higher potency (EC<sup>50 </sup>= 11 nM) than human lymphotactin on the human lymphotactin receptor.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Activation of the human and murine lymphotactin receptor by human, murine and viral agonists</bold>.

The thin line indicate the EC<sub>50 </sub>for the particular ligand (assuming Emax equal to that of vCCL3). All assays were performed in duplicate.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1743-422X-5-50-2"/></fig><p>In contrast, only mXCL1 was able to activate the murine lymphotactin receptor, while vCCL3 and XCL1 were unable to do so (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). It should be noted that only a relatively high concentration of mXCL1 (100 nM) consistently generated an IP3 response through the murine lymphotactin receptor. This observation could be explained if mXCL1 was not properly folded or was partly proteolyzed. However, this is unlikely as 1 nM of mXCL1 in all assays was able to activate the human lymphotactin receptor. To rule out a vector-specific effect, we performed similar assays using the mXCR1 gene inserted into pcDNA3.1. However, no difference in results was found using the two vector constructs (data not shown). The low potency of mXCL1 on the mXCR1 in the IP3 assay could also be related to the cell-line used, but again this explanation seems unlikely as we also had difficulties in generating calcium mobilization responses to mXCL1 in single clones of L1.2- and 300.19- cells transfected with murine lymphotactin receptor cDNA, which suggested that mXCL1 indeed had low potency for the lymphotactin receptor. A more likely explanation of the poor potency of mXCL1 for mXCR1 could be that either the extra N-terminal methionine or the lack of glycosylation of the E. Coli-produced recombinant murine lymphotactin prevented proper activation of the murine but not the human lymphotactin receptor.</p></sec><sec><title>Antagonistic activity on XCR1 and mXCR1</title><p>We next tested whether vCCL2 was able to act as an antagonist on the murine and the human lymphotactin receptors. As reported before [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], vCCL2 did block responses through XCR1 using submaximal doses of either XCL1, mXCL1 or vCCL3 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). As expected the IC<sub>50 values </sub>were almost the same no matter which agonist was used (mXCL1 had an IC<sub>50 </sub>= 2.1 nM; XCL1 had an IC<sub>50 </sub>= 3.0 nM and vCCL3 had an IC<sub>50 </sub>= 2.8 nM). In contrast, vCCL2 was unable to inhibit the response of mXCL1 through the murine lymphotactin receptor (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Inhibition of the human and murine lymphotactin receptor by the viral antagonist vCCL2</bold>.

All assays were performed in duplicate.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1743-422X-5-50-3"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Virally encoded chemokines and species barriers</title><p>Surprisingly, XCL1 could not activate the murine lymphotactin receptor although the sequences of mXCL1 and XCL1 are very similar (60 % identity and 84 % similarity using BLASTP 2.2.17 at the NCBI website)(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). In contrast, vCCL2 and vCCL3 have only 31 and 32 % identity and 50 and 54 % similarity to XCL1, although all three ligands target the same receptor. These points are illustrated on the left side of Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>. XCL1 and mXCL1 are clustered, whereas vCCL2 and vCCL3 are more distantly related to XCL1 although they target the same receptor (right side of Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). As can be seen from Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, it seems to be a rule that human encoded chemokines acting on a particular chemokine receptor, cluster with each other but not with the viral encoded chemokines targeting the same receptor. There is one exception, vCCL2, which on the dendrogram in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> lies in the middle of a cluster of CCR1, CCR2, and CCR5 ligands. However, vCCL2 also targets XCR1, CX3CR1 and CXCR4 and it does not cluster with the ligands of these receptors.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Amino-acid sequence similarity of human and viral encoded chemokines compared to their chemokine receptor targets</bold>. Left side of the figure is a comparison of the similiarity of the primary protein sequence of human and virally encoded chemokines (using ClustalW 1.83 and an unbranched dendrogram) with the receptor targets of the specific chemokines seen on the right side of the figure. The names of the virally encoded chemokines are highlighted in bold. On the right hand side a line is used to illustrate that a specific chemokine is a ligand for a specific chemokine receptor. The line is unbroken for endogenous human chemokines and dotted for virally encoded chemokines. The murine lymphotactin has been included to illustrate the great similarity between XCL1 and mXCL1.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1743-422X-5-50-4"/></fig><p>This sequence divergence between viral and human chemokines may explain why human and not viral encoded chemokines in general are able to cross a species barrier. Human encoded chemokines are very similar to their murine counterparts but very dissimilar to the viral encoded chemokines they share receptor targets with. Thus one can imagine that a virus during evolution has picked up an ancestral chemokine gene and optimized it in a unique way to suit the virus, while retaining the ability to target the corresponding chemokine receptor of its host. However, during this process the hijacked chemokine has changed so much that it has lost the ability to cross species barriers. As seen in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>, the CMV encoded chemokine vCXCL1, the pox virus encoded chemokine MC148 and, as shown in this paper, the KSHV encoded chemokines vCCL2 and vCCL3 are not able to target their corresponding murine receptors, while only vCCL1 encoded by KSHV has retained this ability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>vCCL2 has been used in several <italic>in vivo </italic>models, especially in rodent models, as a broad-spectrum chemokine receptor blocker. For example vCCL2 has been shown to reduce T-cell mediated inflammation in a murine lymphocytic choriomeningitis model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], to protect the brain of mice against cerebral ischemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], to reduce inflammation in a rat model of spinal cord contusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and in a rat model of glomerulonephritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The results from this study suggest that the reduction of inflammation by vCCL2 in these experiments is not due to inhibition of the lymphotactin receptor, but must be due to inhibition of one or more of the CCR1, CCR2, CCR5, CX3CR1 and CXCR4 receptors.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The chemokines vCCL2 and vCCL3 encoded by KSHV do not target the murine lymphotactin receptor, although they act as a high potency antagonist and agonist respectively, on the human lymphotactin receptor. So the only tool left, for investigating the role of the lymphotactin receptor pathways in murine models, is the commercially available recombinant form of murine lymphotactin with a rather low potency on the mXCR1 receptor. Furthermore, when the findings of this paper are combined with the results from other studies on the ability of chemokines encoded by human viruses to target the murine counterparts to their human chemokine receptor targets, it can be concluded that they rarely do so. In contrast, human encoded chemokines in general are able to cross the species barrier and target their corresponding murine chemokine receptors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Chemokines</title><p>mXCL1, XCL1, vCCL2 were purchased from R&#x00026;D (Minneapolis, MN).
