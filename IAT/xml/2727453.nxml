Genetic evidence shows that over-expression of MzrA&#x02014;formerly known as YqjB and EcfM&#x02014;modulates the activity of EnvZ/OmpR similarly to pleiotropic EnvZ mutants and alter porin expression. However, porin expression in strains devoid of MzrA or over-expressing it is still sensitive to medium osmolarity, pH and procaine, all of which modulate EnvZ/OmpR activities. Thus, MzrA appears to alter the output of the EnvZ/OmpR system but not its ability to receive and respond to various environmental signals. Localization and topology experiments indicate that MzrA is a type II membrane protein, with its N-terminus exposed in the cytoplasm and C-terminus in the periplasm. Bacterial two-hybrid experiments determined that MzrA specifically interacts with EnvZ but not with OmpR or the related membrane sensor kinase, CpxA. This and additional genetic and biochemical evidence suggest that the interaction of MzrA with EnvZ would either enhance EnvZ&#x02019;s kinase activity or reduce its phosphatase activity, thus elevating the steady state levels of OmpR~P. Furthermore, our data show that MzrA links the two-component envelope stress response regulators, CpxA/CpxR and EnvZ/OmpR.</p></abstract><contract-num rid="GM1">R01 GM048167-14A1</contract-num><contract-sponsor id="GM1">National Institute of General Medical Sciences : NIGMS</contract-sponsor></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">The outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria is the first defense barrier between the often hostile milieu in which the bacteria live and their intracellular contents. Consequently, integrity of the outer membrane is of utmost importance for bacterial survival and pathogenesis. A unique glycolipid, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) coats the outer leaflet of the outer membrane, while phospholipids are partitioned exclusively in the inner leaflet of the outer membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Nikaido and Vaara, 1985</xref>). The outer membrane is also home to &#x003b2;-barrel-forming outer membrane proteins (OMPs) as well as lipoproteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Nikaido and Vaara, 1985</xref>).</p><p id="P3">The regulation of &#x003b2;-barrel OMP synthesis has been extensively studied. In particular, the EnvZ/OmpR-mediated regulation of OmpF and OmpC, the two major pore-forming OMPs, has been a paradigm for understanding gene regulation by two-component signal transduction systems (for reviews, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">Hoch and Silhavy, 1995</xref>). EnvZ is a membrane-bound sensor kinase, although the signal it senses is not known. OmpR is a cytosolic response regulator, which binds to the promoter region of the porin genes. Changes in medium osmolarity profoundly affect OmpF and OmpC expression: OmpC is preferentially expressed in high osmolarity, whereas OmpF expression is favored in low osmolarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R59">van Alphen and Lugtenberg, 1977</xref>). Although the level of OmpR~P <italic>in vivo</italic> has not been determined, it is presumed that the [OmpR~P] increases with increasing osmolarity, promoting activation and then repression of <italic>ompF</italic> and activation of <italic>ompC</italic>. Other factors, including local anesthetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Villarejo and Case, 1984</xref>), pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Heyde and Portalier, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Sato <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>), and nutrition limitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R36">Liu and Ferenci, 1998</xref>) also influence <italic>ompF</italic> and <italic>ompC</italic> transcription in an EnvZ/OmpR-dependent manner.</p><p id="P4">In recent years, biogenesis of OMPs has received renewed attention owing to the discovery of the &#x003b2;-barrel OMP assembly machine (Bam), comprised of four lipoproteins (BamBCDE) and a &#x003b2;-barrel OMP, BamA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R64">Wu <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">Sklar <italic>et al</italic>., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R41">Misra, 2007</xref>). In the event of OMP misassembly or other envelope aberrations, cells invoke regulatory responses to minimize the envelope stress. Two principal regulators that control these responses are a specialized sigma factor &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Alba and Gross, 2004</xref>) and the CpxA/CpxR two-component system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">Raivio and Silhavy, 2001</xref>). An inner membrane protein, RseA, normally sequesters &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> but misassembly of OMPs triggers two-step proteolysis of RseA, releasing &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup>. Free &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> activates transcription of factors involved in OMP biogenesis, including periplasmic foldases SurA, Skp; a periplasmic foldase/protease, DegP; members of the Bam complex; genes involved in LPS biogenesis; and small RNAs that inhibit OMP synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">Rhodius <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). Thus genes activated by the &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup> regulon help maintain a homoeostasis between OMP synthesis and OMP assembly. In contrast to the activation of &#x003c3;<sup>E</sup>, a diverse group of envelope stresses appear to activate the CpxA/CpxR system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">DiGiuseppe and Silhavy, 2003</xref>). Once activated, the CpxA/CpxR system induces the synthesis of periplasmic folding/degradation factors including DsbA, PpiA, and DegP, indicating that regardless of the source of envelope aberration, the ultimate targets of the CpxA/CpxR system include misfolded envelope proteins.</p><p id="P5">The robustness of the envelope homeostasis loop can be compromised if cells lack one or more OMP folding and/or degradation factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">Rizzitello <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R43">Onufryk <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>). An <italic>E. coli</italic> mutant simultaneously lacking DegP and BamB displays a conditional lethal (temperature sensitive; <italic>ts</italic>) phenotype, i.e., unable to grow at 37&#x000b0;C, but forms small but homogeneous colonies at 30&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Charlson <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). The absence of BamB also causes antibiotic hypersensitivity to both hydrophobic (e.g. rifampin) and hydrophilic (e.g. vancomycin) antibiotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">Eggert <italic>et al</italic>., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R61">Vuong <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>). In the present study, the temperature and antibiotic sensitivity phenotypes of &#x00394;<italic>bamB</italic> &#x00394;<italic>degP</italic> were exploited to isolate multicopy and mutational suppressors.</p><p id="P6">Isolation of multicopy suppressors identified a novel gene, <italic>mzrA</italic> (<italic>yqjB</italic>), while mutational suppressors identified pleiotropic <italic>envZ</italic> mutations. These mutations affect the expression of genes that are archetypal members of the EnvZ/OmpR regulon, such as <italic>ompF</italic> and <italic>ompC</italic>, and also influence the expression of genes, including <italic>lamB</italic> and <italic>malE</italic>, normally not controlled by the EnvZ/OmpR regulon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Wandersman <italic>et al</italic>., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Case <italic>et al</italic>., 1986</xref>). Characterization of these suppressors showed that over-expression of <italic>mzrA</italic> (<italic>yqjB</italic>) modulates the EnvZ/OmpR two-component signal transduction regulon in a manner similar to the <italic>envZ</italic> suppressor mutations.

The phenotypic convergence of the two classes of suppressors suggests that they work through a similar mechanism to reduce envelope stress; in part, this entails reduction in OMP synthesis.

DNA sequence analysis of the insert DNA from four positive clones showed that three contained the intact <italic>yfgM</italic>-<italic>bamB</italic> genes while one clone carried a contiguous chromosomal region containing <italic>exuT</italic>&#x02032;, exuR, <italic>yqjA</italic>, <italic>mzrA</italic> (<italic>yqjB</italic>), <italic>yqjC</italic>, <italic>yqjD</italic>, and <italic>yqjE</italic>&#x02032; genes. We focused on the <italic>exuT</italic>-<italic>yqj</italic> clone because the <italic>yfgM</italic>-<italic>bamB</italic> clone most likely improved growth by complementing the &#x00394;<italic>bamB</italic> mutation of the recipient strain.

At 30&#x000b0;C, they formed colonies that were much larger than those formed by the parental &#x00394;<italic>bamB</italic> &#x00394;<italic>degP</italic> strain. Subsequent subcloning experiments narrowed the gene responsible for improved growth of the &#x00394;<italic>bamB</italic> &#x00394;<italic>degP</italic> strain to <italic>mzrA</italic> (<italic>yqjB</italic>).</p><p id="P8">To gain insight into the mechanism by which over-expression of MzrA (YqjB) improves the growth of the &#x00394;<italic>bamB</italic> &#x00394;<italic>degP</italic> strain, we first examined the OMP profile. We have previously showed that reduced OMP levels partially suppress the <italic>ts</italic> phenotype of &#x00394;<italic>bamB</italic> &#x00394;<italic>degP</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">Charlson <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). The presence of the original <italic>exuT</italic>-<italic>yqj</italic> clone in the &#x00394;<italic>bamB</italic> &#x00394;<italic>degP</italic> strain showed a marked reduction of OmpF from cell envelopes (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1A</xref>). In the subsequent experiment, we used a plasmid clone expressing MzrA (YqjB) from an IPTG-inducible promoter. Over-expression of MzrA (YqjB) from an IPTG-inducible promoter dramatically reduced levels of OmpF and LamB, and to some extent MalE, but not OmpC and OmpA. The effects of MzrA (YqjB) were just as pronounced in a <italic>bamB</italic><sup>+</sup><italic>degP</italic><sup>+</sup> strain (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B and C</xref>; lanes 1 and 2) as they were in a strain deleted for these genes (data not shown). Thus, mitigation of envelope stress was independent of other known pathways and was remarkably similar to a class of suppressor mutations identified through our antibiotic selection of &#x00394;<italic>bamB</italic> &#x00394;<italic>degP</italic> that localized to <italic>envZ</italic> (see below; <xref rid="F8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>). This result prompted us to examine the relationship between MzrA (YqjB) and the EnvZ/OmpR two-component regulatory system in influencing OMP and MalE levels.</p></sec><sec id="S4"><title>MzrA (YqjB) functions through EnvZ/OmpR</title><p id="P9">Over-expression of MzrA (YqjB) produces phenotypes similar to that conferred by pleiotropic <italic>envZ</italic> alleles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R63">Wanner <italic>et al</italic>., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R62">Wandersman <italic>et al</italic>., 1980</xref>). Pleiotropic <italic>envZ</italic> alleles are dependent on OmpR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">Slauch <italic>et al</italic>., 1988</xref>). Thus, we determined whether the effect of MzrA (YqjB), were also OmpR-dependent. For this experiment, we employed a non-polar null allele of <italic>ompR</italic>, <italic>ompR101</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">Sarma and Reeves, 1977</xref>). As expected, expression of both OmpF and OmpC was abolished in an <italic>envZ</italic><sup>+</sup><italic>ompR101</italic> background, but LamB and MalE were expressed normally (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B and C</xref>). In contrast to the effect seen in an <italic>envZ</italic><sup>+</sup><italic>ompR</italic><sup>+</sup> background (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>, lane 2), over-expression of MzrA (YqjB) in an <italic>envZ</italic><sup>+</sup><italic>ompR101</italic> background failed to reduce LamB and MalE levels (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>, lane 4), indicating that OmpR is required for the effect of MzrA (YqjB). To further evaluate a requirement of OmpR for the negative effect of MzrA (YqjB) over-expression on OMPs and MalE, we employed another well-studied <italic>ompR</italic> allele, <italic>ompR472</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Hall and Silhavy, 1981</xref>), which produces an OmpF<sup>+</sup> OmpC<sup>&#x02212;</sup> phenotype without influencing LamB and MalE expression (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B and C</xref>, lane 7). Again, we failed to see any negative effect of MzrA (YqjB) over-expression on OmpF, LamB, or MalE (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B and C</xref>, lane 8), thus emphasizing the need for wild type OmpR to observe the effects of MzrA (YqjB).</p><p id="P10">Next we tested the requirement for EnvZ in MzrA (YqjB)-mediated effects. In the absence of EnvZ, OmpC is not expressed while OmpF is expressed at diminished levels (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1B</xref>, lane 5). The low OmpF expression seen in an <italic>envZ</italic> null background is thought to be due to the phosphorylation of OmpR by acetyl phosphate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Hsing and Silhavy, 1997</xref>). Although expression of OmpC and OmpF is affected, LamB and MalE expression is not significantly altered in an <italic>envZ</italic> null background (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1C</xref>, lane 5). If MzrA (YqjB) directly influences OmpR, regardless of how OmpR gets phosphorylated, we may still observe the negative effects of MzrA (YqjB) on OmpF, LamB, and MalE in an <italic>envZ</italic> null background. On the other hand, if MzrA (YqjB) modulates EnvZ activity then in an <italic>envZ</italic> null background over-expression of MzrA (YqjB) will fail to reduce OmpF, LamB or MalE levels. The data in <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref> showed that over-expression of MzrA (YqjB) in an <italic>envZ</italic> null background was unable to exert a negative effect on OmpF, LamB, or MalE (compare lane 5 and 6 in B and C). It is important to note that MzrA expression from the pTrc99A clone was unaffected in various mutant OmpR and EnvZ backgrounds (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1D</xref>), demonstrating that a lack of negative effect on OMPs or MalE was not the result of reduced MzrA expression. These results support our hypothesis that MzrA (YqjB) influences EnvZ activity which then transforms OmpR into a form responsible for the pleiotropic phenotype. Thus, YqjB was renamed MzrA, for <underline>m</underline>odulator of Env<underline>Z</underline> and Omp<underline>R</underline> A and will be henceforth referred to by this designation.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>MzrA influences steady-state expression of porins independently of the known modulators</title><p id="P11">Since over-expression of MzrA affects porin expression in an EnvZ/OmpR-dependent manner, we investigated whether MzrA plays a role in the osmoregulation of porins. Envelopes were isolated from wild type and &#x00394;<italic>mzrA</italic> strains carrying either an empty vector pBAD33 or pBAD33-<italic>mzrA</italic><sub>FLAG</sub>. Cultures were grown in medium A (low osmolarity) and medium A supplemented with 15% sucrose (high osmolarity) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R33">Kawaji <italic>et al</italic>., 1979</xref>). OMPs were analyzed from envelopes by SDS (urea)-PAGE and protein bands were visualized by coomassie blue staining. In the wild type strain carrying just the empty vector, porin expression responded to medium osmolarity in an expected manner, i.e., high OmpF and low OmpC under low osmolarity and low OmpF and high OmpC under high osmolarity (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, lanes 1 and 3). In contrast, a significantly different porin expression profile was observed in the absence of MzrA, with OmpF being preferentially expressed regardless of the medium osmolarity (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, lanes 5 and 7). When MzrA was over-expressed, the porin expression profile switched in favor of OmpC, regardless of medium osmolarity (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2A</xref>, lanes 2, 4, 6, 8). The fact that porin expression still responds to medium osmolarity in cells lacking or overexpressing MzrA suggets that MzrA is not the primarily receptor of medium osmolarity, rather, it appears to bias EnvZ/OmpR activity to favor OmpC expression over OmpF. In agreement with a recent report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Batchelor <italic>et al</italic>., 2005</xref>), we confirmed that deletion of <italic>cpxR</italic>, which only weakly reduces <italic>mzrA</italic> expression (see below), does not significantly influence porin expression or their osmoregulation (data not shown).</p><p id="P12">The local anesthetic, procaine, is known to alter porin expression in an EnvZ/OmpR-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Villarejo and Case, 1984</xref>) similar to pleiotropic <italic>envZ</italic> mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R60">Villarejo and Case, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Case <italic>et al</italic>., 1986</xref>) and MzrA over-expression (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). Porin expression in a strain deleted for <italic>mzrA</italic> still responded to the presence of procaine in the same fashion as did the MzrA<sup>+</sup> parental strain (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>). Thus, MzrA does not mediate the effect of procaine on porin expression. Medium pH is also known to influence porin expression in an EnvZ/OmpR-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Heyde and Portalier, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">Sato <italic>et al</italic>., 2000</xref>). At pH 8.0, OmpF to OmpC ratio in an <italic>mzrA</italic> strain was significantly higher than in the parental <italic>mzrA</italic><sup>+</sup> strain, but at pH 5.0 OmpC was the predominant porin in both strains (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2B</xref>), showing that pH-dependent porin regulation is independent of MzrA. Together, these data suggest that MzrA modulates the output activity of the EnvZ/OmpR system without influencing its ability to respond to various environmental signals.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Evidence for MzrA&#x02019;s specificity</title><p id="P13">To test MzrA specificity for EnvZ and not other related membrane kinases, we used four different operon fusions whose activities are dependent on PhoP/PhoQ (<italic>mgtA::lacZ; mgrB::lacZ</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R32">Kato <italic>et al</italic>., 1999</xref>), CpxA/CpxR (<italic>ppiA::lacZ</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">Pogliano <italic>et al</italic>., 1997</xref>), or EnvZ/OmpR (<italic>ompF::lacZ</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Hall and Silhavy, 1981</xref>).

The wild type and mutant activities are directly compared over ten minute time course. It is apparent that the wild type and the mutant have quite similar autophosphorylation levels. We selected 10 minute time point for EnvZ autophosphorylation to compare the phosphotransfer to OmpR (<xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9B</xref>). After addition of OmpR, the phosphoryl group from EnvZ~P is transferred to OmpR and the mass of the labeled band shifts (lanes 2&#x02013;4 and 6&#x02013;8). By visual inspection, the, phosphotransfer activities of the wild type and the mutant appear somewhat similar. However, densitometric analysis of OmpR~P (produced by EnvZ~P or EnvZcR397L~P) indicated that at every time point, there was more OmpR~P present when phosphorylated by EnvZcR397L compared to the wild type (<xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9C</xref>). This is most dramatic at 15 minutes, where there was nearly 50% more OmpR~P present. We then measured EnvZ ATPase activity. EnvZ is phosphorylated directly from ATP, transfers its histidyl phosphate to OmpR, and subsequently stimulates OmpR~P dephosphorylation. This results in the net breakdown of ATP and the subsequent release of inorganic phosphate from OmpR~P. The sum of these reactions can therefore be analyzed by measuring ATP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R34">Kenney, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">Mattison and Kenney, 2002</xref>). We measured inorganic phosphate (P<sub>i</sub>) production over time at a ratio of 2:1 EnvZ to OmpR (<xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9D</xref>).

It is worth noting that previously characterized pleiotropic EnvZ mutants were also shown to have diminished phosphatase activity, thus resulting in an elevated half life of OmpR~P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Aiba <italic>et al</italic>., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R58">Tokishita <italic>et al</italic>., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Hsing <italic>et al</italic>., 1998</xref>).

Though an exhaustive amount of research has been carried out in this area, it remains unclear as to how EnvZ senses environmental stimuli and how this sensing alters its autokinase, phosphotransferase, and phosphatase activities. Results presented in this study showed that MzrA, a small inner membrane protein, is an upstream regulator of the EnvZ/OmpR system. Though the porin expression profile in cells either lacking or over-expressing MzrA was drastically different compared to that seen in wild type MzrA<sup>+</sup> cells, porin expression still responded to changes in medium osmolarity, pH or the presence of procaine in the medium, suggesting that MzrA is not the primary receptor of these three environmental cues that influence porin expression via EnvZ/OmpR. Based on the porin expression profile when MzrA is over-expressed (high OmpC, low OmpF regardless of the medium osmolarity), it appears that MzrA modulates the EnvZ/OmpR system to favor the accumulation of OmpR~P (<xref rid="F9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9</xref>). This could be achieved by an elevated autokinase activity, diminished phosphatase activity or a combination of the two. Because OmpR has a high non-specific binding component and lacks highly conserved binding sites, it is a good global regulator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">Rhee <italic>et al</italic>. 2008</xref>).

Exactly how the binding of MzrA to EnvZ modulates EnvZ enzymatic activity remains to be determined, but we demonstrated that it does so by increasing OmpR~P stability.

In contrast, the central region of MzrA, which is exposed to the periplasm, contains conserved residues that may make direct contact with the periplasmic domain of EnvZ. We suggest that residues of the MzrA periplasmic domain play an important role in modulating EnvZ enzymatic activity. An earlier search for a periplasmic protein ligand that interacts with the periplasmic domain of EnvZ was unsuccessful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">Egger and Inouye, 1996</xref>).

However, the environmental cues to which they respond are distinct; whereas alkaline pH or misfolded pilus subunits activate CpxA/CpxR, medium osmolarity is the best-characterized effector of EnvZ/OmpR. Thus, despite responding to different stimuli, MzrA-mediated linking of the CpxA/CpxR and EnvZ/OmpR regulatory systems would allow cells to amplify their response to appropriately adjust the envelope composition (see <xref rid="F10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10</xref>).</p><p id="P33">Bridging of separate two-component regulatory systems by a membrane protein is not unique to MzrA.

However, the MzrA-mediated connection of CpxA/CpxR to EnvZ/OmpR would allow participation of <italic>omrAB</italic> to decrease envelope stress by reducing the synthesis of certain OMPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R37">Lundrigan and Earhart, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">Guillier and Gottesman, 2006</xref>), thus helping to maintain homeostasis between OMP assembly and synthesis.</p><p id="P36">Both the pleiotropic <italic>envZ</italic> mutations and over-expression of MzrA reduce the drug hypersensitivity phenotype of &#x00394;<italic>bamB</italic>, against which they were isolated, but also of unrelated &#x00394;<italic>surA</italic> and &#x00394;<italic>tolA</italic> mutations. The root cause of the hypersensitivity phenotype conferred by the &#x00394;<italic>bamB</italic>, &#x00394;<italic>surA</italic> and &#x00394;<italic>tolA</italic> mutations is presently unknown, but it is likely due to a compromised outer membrane permeability barrier. Formation of phospholipid bilayer patches in the outer membrane is often thought to be associated with sensitivity to hydrophobic antibiotics, such as rifampin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R42">Nikaido and Vaara, 1985</xref>), but sensitivity to a hydrophilic antibiotic, vancomycin, may be due to the formation of &#x0201c;cracks&#x0201d; through which this large antibiotic can slip through (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R50">Ruiz <italic>et al</italic>., 2006</xref>). The ability to reduce sensitivity to both classes of antibiotics suggests that pleiotropic <italic>envZ</italic> mutations and the over-expression of MzrA employ a common mechanism to repair the outer membrane permeability breach. Interestingly, <italic>yqjA</italic>, the first gene of the <italic>yqjA</italic>-<italic>mzrA</italic> operon, has been shown to be involved in some aspect of membrane permeability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">Shi <italic>et al</italic>., 2004</xref>) and phospholipid synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">Thompkins <italic>et al</italic>., 2008</xref>).

Also shown are genes that are independently or uniquely affected by the CpxA/CpxR regulon. Not all genes that may be affected by the activated CpxA/CpxR and EnvZ/OmpR regulons are shown. Others refer to unknown factors that may regulate MzrA&#x02019;s synthesis.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="nihms118494f10"/></fig></sec><ack id="S27"><p>We are indebted to Tom Silhavy, Natacha Ruiz, Tracy Raivio, and Yixin Shi for some bacterial strains used here and to Yixin Shi for insightful discussion.
