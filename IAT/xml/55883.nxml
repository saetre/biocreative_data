Depletion of Erb1p resulted in a loss of 25S and 5.8S rRNAs synthesis, while causing only a&#x000a0;moderate reduction and not a complete block in 18S rRNA formation. Processing analysis showed that Erb1p is required for synthesis of 7S pre-rRNA and mature 25S rRNA from 27SB pre-rRNA. In Erb1p-depleted cells these products of 27SB processing are largely absent and 27SB pre-rRNA is under-accumulated, apparently due to degradation. In addition, depletion of Erb1p caused delayed processing of the 35S pre-rRNA. These findings demonstrate that Erb1p, like its mammalian counterpart Bop1, is required for formation of rRNA components of the large ribosome particles. The similarities in processing defects caused by functional disruption of Erb1p and Bop1 suggest that late steps in maturation of the large ribosome subunit rRNAs employ mechanisms that are evolutionarily conserved throughout eukaryotes.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>In eukaryotes, ribosome biogenesis is a highly complex process that involves the assembly of four ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) and about 80 ribosomal proteins into 60S and 40S ribosome subunits within a specialized nuclear compartment, the nucleolus. Our current understanding of ribosome synthesis is largely organized around observed rRNA processing steps. In yeast, three rRNAs (18S, 5.8S and 25S) are derived from a single 35S precursor rRNA (pre-rRNA) transcribed by RNA polymerase I. The primary transcript contains, in addition to sequences present in the mature ribosome, flanking regions designated 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; external transcribed sequences (5&#x02032;-ETS and 3&#x02032;-ETS) and intervening sequences termed internal transcribed spacers 1 and 2 (ITS1 and ITS2). The primary transcript is extensively modified by methylation and pseudouridylation and processed via a series of endo- and exonucleolytic reactions. This process ultimately generates the mature 18S, 5.8S and 25S rRNAs and appears to occur in parallel with assembly of ribosomal particles. A large number of <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors required for ribosome biogenesis have been identified to date, including more than 150 small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) and multiple non-ribosomal proteins (for reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke489c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke489c2">2</xref>).</p><p> Much of our current knowledge of rRNA processing comes from studies in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>. Ribosome synthesis in other organisms is not well characterized largely due to the lack of comparably amenable systems for genetic manipulation. However, insights obtained from studies of yeast ribosome biogenesis should have relevance in other eukaryotes. rRNA structure and processing are generally similar among a wide range of eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke489c3">3</xref>) and recent sequencing efforts have revealed that many known factors in yeast ribosome biogenesis have counterparts throughout the eukaryotic kingdom.</p><p> In order to characterize rRNA processing in mammalian cells, we have employed a strategy of inducible expression of dominant negative mutants to inactivate the function of critical proteins involved in ribosome biogenesis. Using this strategy, we have recently identified and characterized a novel mouse nucleolar protein, Bop1, that is involved in rRNA processing and ribosome assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke489c4">4</xref>). Bop1&#x00394;, an N-terminally truncated form of Bop1, acts as a dominant negative inhibitor of Bop1 function in mouse cells, causing a block of synthesis of mature 28S and 5.8S rRNAs and a deficiency in 60S ribosomal subunit assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke489c4">4</xref>). Analysis of pre-rRNA processing revealed that in Bop1&#x00394;-expressing cells there is reduced conversion of the 36S precursor to 32S pre-rRNA, which in turn is blocked from being processed to 28S and 12S&#x0002f;5.8S rRNAs, but instead is degraded. Expression of Bop1&#x00394; thus completely blocks formation of mature 28S and 5.8S rRNAs, although it has only a minor effect on synthesis of 18S rRNA and production of 40S subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke489c4">4</xref>). Bop1 contains WD repeats, a structural motif involved in intra- and intermolecular protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke489c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke489c6">6</xref>).</p><p> To understand the function of Bop1 further, we sought to establish the role of its homolog in yeast. In this work we identify YMR049C, the <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> homolog of mammalian <italic>Bop1</italic>, as an essential gene required for synthesis of 25S and 5.8S rRNAs. Together with our previous results, these findings demonstrate that Bop1 is an essential factor in large ribosomal subunit biogenesis, conserved from yeast to mammals both structurally and functionally. In reference to the important role of this protein in <underline>e</underline>ukaryotic <underline>r</underline>ibosome <underline>b</underline>iogenesis, we named the yeast gene <italic>ERB1</italic> (yeast <italic>BOP1</italic> is an unrelated gene). Bop1&#x0002f;Erb1p is the first protein for which a detailed analysis of pre-rRNA processing effects has been performed in both yeast and mammalian cells. The functional disruption of <italic>ERB1</italic> in yeast and <italic>Bop1</italic> in mouse cells provides a unique opportunity for parallel analysis of pre-rRNA processing in these two species, thereby contributing to our understanding of mechanisms of ribosome formation in higher eukaryotes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Strains, media and genetic methods</title><p><italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> strains used in this work are derivatives of the diploid strain resulting from crossing BY4741 with BY4742 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke489c7">7</xref>).

All these proteins contain WD repeats that are similarly positioned in the C-terminal portion of the protein sequence. Based on an analysis of multiple aligned sequences, we now recognize five distinct WD repeats (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke489f1">1</xref>), whereas only four WD repeats were initially described in the mouse Bop1 sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke489c16">16</xref>). Individual repeats show various levels of divergence from the canonical structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke489c5">5</xref>). Two additional WD-like segments are identified in some organisms within the gap between WD repeats 1 and 2, but their scores fall below significance level. The absence of critical amino acid residues and lack of evolutionary conservation preclude their assignment as true WD repeats. However, this leads to an interesting speculation that in the &#x02018;primordial&#x02019; Bop1 the entire C-terminus (starting with WD1, as shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke489f1">1</xref>) may have consisted entirely of WD repeats. In addition to a well-conserved core, all these proteins contain an N-terminal domain of 50&#x02013;150 amino acid residues that is not conserved at the sequence level, but has a similar composition predominated by polar residues such as serine, threonine, aspartate and glutamate.</p><p> These data show that Bop1 is structurally conserved throughout the Eukaryota. All eukaryotic organisms with sequenced genomes appear to contain a single copy of this gene. No homologs of Bop1 were found in Archaea or Eubacteria.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>ERB1</italic>, the yeast homolog of mammalian <italic>Bop1</italic>, is an essential gene</title><p>The mouse Bop1 protein has been previously shown to participate in the regulation of ribosome biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke489c4">4</xref>) and cell cycle control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke489c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke489c17">17</xref>), based on the analysis of its dominant-negative mutant protein, Bop1&#x00394;. To investigate the yeast homolog of Bop1, we replaced the <italic>ERB1</italic> allele (the previously uncharacterized open reading frame YMR049C) with a <italic>URA3</italic> marker cassette (see Materials and Methods). Tetrad analysis of the resulting diploid strain showed 2:2 segregation of viable to non-viable spores (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke489f2">2</xref>). All viable spores were Ura<sup>&#x02013;</sup>, indicating that disruption of <italic>ERB1</italic> is incompatible with vegetative growth. We constructed a centromeric plasmid for conditional expression of <italic>ERB1</italic> from the glucose-repressible <italic>GAL1</italic> promoter (see Materials and Methods). Expression of Erb1p from this plasmid supported growth of <italic>erb1</italic>::<italic>URA3</italic> strains on YPGal plates, whereas repression of Erb1p with glucose on YPD plates prevented growth (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke489f2">2</xref>).</p><p> Effects of <italic>ERB1</italic> disruption on growth were next studied in strain YDP0135, in which the <italic>GAL1</italic> promoter drove expression of HA-tagged Erb1p. The growth rate of this strain on galactose-containing medium was exponential and similar to that of the wild-type strain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke489f3">3</xref>A and data not shown). Repression of the promoter by shifting cells to glucose-containing YPD medium led to a significant impediment of growth at 8&#x02013;12 h after medium shift (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke489f3">3</xref>A). We analyzed expression of HA&#x02013;Erb1p in this strain by immunoblotting using antibodies against the HA tag. In cells grown in galactose-containing medium we detected several bands resulting from expression of HA-tagged Erb1p that were absent in the control strain containing non-tagged Erb1p (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke489f3">3</xref>B). The largest form of HA&#x02013;Erb1p migrated in SDS&#x02013;polyacrylamide gels at &#x0223c;140 kDa, which is larger than the calculated molecular mass of Erb1p (93 kDa). This anomalous mobility is also observed for mouse Bop1, which migrates at &#x0003e;100 kDa but has a calculated molecular mass of 83 kDa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke489c4">4</xref>). Several other HA-tagged polypeptides that are also detected in the HA&#x02013;Erb1p strain, including two prominent bands migrating at 80&#x02013;85 kDa, may represent proteolytically processed forms of Erb1p (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke489f3">3</xref>B). The amounts of all these proteins were significantly reduced &#x0223c;2 h after a shift from galactose- to glucose-containing medium, indicating that Erb1p is indeed depleted (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke489f3">3</xref>B).</p></sec><sec><title>Depletion of Erb1p impairs synthesis of 25S and 5.8S rRNA</title><p>Since Bop1 is involved in processing of pre-rRNA in mouse cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke489c4">4</xref>), we tested whether inhibition of cell growth caused by depletion of Erb1p may be related to defects in pre-rRNA synthesis. Analysis of total RNA prepared from YDP0135 cells after repression of <italic>ERB1</italic> showed a decrease in rRNA, with a progressively declining ratio of 25S to 18S rRNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke489f3">3</xref>C), indicating that 25S rRNA is preferentially affected. This result suggested that, like its mouse homolog, Erb1p plays a role in biogenesis of the large ribosome subunit rRNA.</p><p> Expression of Bop1&#x00394;, a dominant negative form of Bop1, in mouse cells affects several processing steps in 28S rRNA formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke489c4">4</xref>). We therefore tested whether depletion of its yeast homolog may affect pre-rRNA processing (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke489f4">4</xref>). First, we analyzed pre-rRNA processing by pulse&#x02013;chase labeling of RNA with &#x0005b;methyl-<sup>3</sup>H&#x0005d;methionine (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke489f5">5</xref>, upper panels). To show that the observed effects are not due to altered methylation, we performed a similar analysis in cells labeled with &#x0005b;<sup>3</sup>H&#x0005d;uracil (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke489f5">5</xref>, lower panels).</p><p> The kinetics of pre-rRNA processing in <italic>erb1</italic>::<italic>URA3</italic> cells grown on galactose-containing medium were essentially similar to those in the wild-type strain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke489f5">5</xref>, compare left and right panels). Depletion of Erb1p in glucose-containing medium produced strong defects in pre-rRNA processing. In&#x000a0;pulse&#x02013;chase labeling of non-depleted cells, 27SA and 20S pre-rRNAs, the products of processing of the primary 35S pre-rRNA at sites A<sub>0</sub>, A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>2</sub> (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke489f4">4</xref>), are already visible after 2 min labeling (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke489f5">5</xref>, left, 0 min chase). In contrast, highly labeled 27SA and 20S pre-rRNAs are not apparent at any point in Erb1p-depleted cells, while 35S pre-rRNA takes longer to process and remains detectable up to 8 min of chase (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke489f5">5</xref>; the center top panel demonstrates this point better because of a more efficient chase with methionine labeling). Although processing of 35S pre-rRNA is delayed after Erb1p depletion, it is not completely blocked: by 8 min of chase most of the material from the labeled 35S pre-rRNA in these cells is processed beyond the A<sub>2</sub> step, judging from accumulation of labeled 18S rRNA.</p><p> Whereas the transfer of label to 18S rRNA still occurs in Erb1p-depleted cells, virtually no labeled 25S rRNA can be detected after 16 min of chase in these cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke489f5">5</xref>, center panels). In control cells expressing Erb1p on galactose medium formation of 25S and 18S rRNAs is essentially complete at this time (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke489f5">5</xref>, left), as it is in wild-type cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke489f5">5</xref>, right). The disappearance of label from the 35S precursor and the absence of label in processing intermediates to 25S rRNA in Erb1p-depleted cells indicates that these precursors are degraded, rather than being extremely slowly converted to 25S rRNA. Analysis of low molecular weight RNAs labeled with &#x0005b;<sup>3</sup>H&#x0005d;uracil also showed loss of synthesis of 5.8S rRNA after Erb1p depletion (data not shown). Thus, Erb1p depletion causes a virtually complete processing block in the branch that leads to formation of 25S and 5.8S rRNAs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke489f4">4</xref>) but does not prevent 18S rRNA synthesis, consistent with the decreasing 25S&#x0002f;18S rRNA ratio in these cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke489f3">3</xref>C).</p></sec><sec><title>Pre-rRNA processing anomalies in Erb1p-depleted cells</title><p>To determine which processing steps are affected by Erb1p depletion, we isolated RNA from depleted, non-depleted and wild-type cells, hybridized them with oligonucleotide probes designed to detect various pre-rRNA intermediates (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke489f6">6</xref>) and quantified the results on a phosphorimager. Consistent with the results of the pulse&#x02013;chase experiments, all hybridization probes complementary to pre-rRNA revealed an increase in steady-state levels of 35S pre-rRNA, indicating that the efficiency of cleavage at site A<sub>0</sub> in the 5&#x02032;-ETS is diminished. The product of A<sub>0</sub> processing, 33S pre-rRNA, is rapidly converted by cleavage at site A<sub>1</sub> to 32S pre-rRNA, whose subsequent processing at site A<sub>2</sub> generates the 20S precursor to 18S rRNA and the 27SA<sub>2</sub> precursor to 25S and 5.8S rRNAs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke489f4">4</xref>). The decrease in levels of 32S pre-rRNA (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke489f5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke489f6">6</xref>) suggests that depletion of Erb1p does not significantly affect processing at site A<sub>2</sub>. As noted above, pulse&#x02013;chase analysis shows accumulation of significant amounts of labeled 18S rRNA after 8&#x02013;16 min of chase (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke489f5">5</xref>), implying that the A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>2</sub> processing steps must occur relatively efficiently. However, the steady-state level of the 20S precursor to 18S rRNA, revealed by hybridization with probe y002, undergoes an 8&#x02013;10-fold decrease after 18&#x02013;24 h of Erb1p depletion (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke489f6">6</xref>). Although these two results may at first seem contradictory, they can be explained by the lack of inhibition of further processing of 20S pre-rRNA in Erb1p-depleted cells. Thus, the combination of lowered influx due to delayed processing of 35S pre-rRNA with rapid subsequent conversion to 18S RNA may account for the low steady-state levels of the 20S precursor observed in northern hybridizations (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke489f6">6</xref>) and the absence of a strongly labeled 20S band in pulse&#x02013;chase labeling (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke489f5">5</xref>).</p><p> Hybridizations with probes y002, y005 and y033 detected an &#x0223c;2-fold accumulation of 23S RNA after Erb1p depletion (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke489f6">6</xref>). This RNA is considered an aberrant product formed by cleavage of 35S pre-rRNA at site A<sub>3</sub>, bypassing processing at sites A<sub>0</sub>&#x02013;A<sub>2</sub>, often observed when pre-rRNA processing is perturbed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke489c1">1</xref>). The increase in 23S RNA thus also indicates that cleavage at site A<sub>0</sub> is delayed. However, we detect no accumulation of other aberrant RNA species, such as 21S or 22S RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke489c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke489c15">15</xref>), arguing that once A<sub>0</sub> processing is completed, subsequent processing at sites A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>2</sub> is not significantly inhibited.</p><p> The steady-state levels of the 27SA<sub>2</sub> pre-rRNA detected with probe y005 show a 4&#x02013;7-fold decrease and the combined levels of the 27SA<sub>2</sub> and 27SA<sub>3</sub> pre-rRNAs detected with probe y001 undergo a 3&#x02013;5-fold decrease at 18&#x02013;24 h after shifting <italic>pGAL1</italic>::<italic>ERB1</italic> cells to glucose-containing medium, as compared with non-depleted cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke489f6">6</xref>). A slowed synthesis due to delayed processing at A<sub>0</sub> likely contributes to the decrease in 27SA pre-rRNA steady-state levels. It is not clear whether 27SA pre-rRNA may also be destabilized. Interestingly, the ratio between the levels of the two products of A<sub>2</sub> cleavage, 27SA<sub>2</sub> and 20S pre-rRNAs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke489f4">4</xref>), is slightly increased in Erb1p-depleted cells (1.3&#x02013;2-fold), suggesting that further processing of 27SA<sub>2</sub> pre-rRNA may in fact occur with reduced efficiency. The end products of the processing branch that starts with 27SA pre-rRNA (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke489f4">4</xref>) are not synthesized in depleted cells: pulse&#x02013;chase analysis shows a virtually complete absence of 25S and 5.8S rRNAs (see above) and hybridization with probe y013 reveals the disappearance of 7S pre-rRNA, a precursor to 5.8S rRNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke489f6">6</xref>).</p><p> We next examined the levels of processing intermediates formed from 27SA pre-rRNA. 27SA<sub>2</sub> pre-rRNA is predominantly processed at site A<sub>3</sub> to give rise to 27SA<sub>3</sub> pre-rRNA and also processed at site B<sub>1L</sub> to generate 27SB<sub>L</sub> pre-rRNA. The subsequent processing of 27SA<sub>3</sub> RNA involves exonucleolytic trimming from site A<sub>3</sub> to site B<sub>1S</sub>, generating 27SB<sub>S</sub> pre-rRNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke489f4">4</xref>). To determine how steady-state levels of the 27SA and 27SB pre-rRNAs are affected by Erb1p depletion, we performed primer extension with oligo y013 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke489f7">7</xref>). In good agreement with the above hybridization results, the intensity of the primer extension stop at site A<sub>2</sub> was reduced (5-fold at 24 h), while the signal at A<sub>3</sub> modestly (1.4-fold) increased, indicating an increase in steady-state levels of 27SA<sub>3</sub> pre-rRNA. The altered A<sub>3</sub>&#x0002f;A<sub>2</sub> ratio in Erb1p-depleted cells may be, at least in part, due to preferential cleavage of the slowly processed 35S pre-rRNA at site A<sub>3</sub>, which also generates 23S RNA (see above).</p><p> The intensity of the primer extension stop corresponding to processing sites B<sub>1S</sub> and B<sub>1L</sub> decreased after Erb1p depletion (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke489f7">7</xref>). The effect was especially striking for the B<sub>1S</sub> stop, which was greatly diminished (13&#x02013;33-fold reduction), while the stop corresponding to site B<sub>1L</sub> decreased to a lesser extent (2&#x02013;3-fold). One possible interpretation of the decrease in the B<sub>1S</sub> signal relative to B<sub>1L</sub> is that processing of 27SA<sub>3</sub> to 27SB<sub>S</sub> pre-rRNA may be more inhibited than that of 27SA<sub>2</sub> to 27SB<sub>L</sub> pre-rRNA. However, the strong decrease in the B<sub>1S</sub> signal is disproportional to the relatively small increase in A<sub>3</sub>, arguing that this effect is unlikely due to blocked 27SA<sub>3</sub> to 27SB<sub>S</sub> processing. Since no precursors are formed in Erb1p-depleted cells beyond 27SB pre-rRNAs and 27SB pre-rRNAs themselves do not accumulate, the bulk of RNA in these precursors appears to be destined for degradation. This raises the possibility that the stronger decrease in the B<sub>1S</sub> signal may also be affected by a more rapid degradation of the newly formed 27SB<sub>S</sub> pre-rRNA as compared with 27SB<sub>L</sub>.</p><p> The pulse&#x02013;chase data (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke489f5">5</xref>) are consistent with the interpretation that 27SB pre-rRNA does not accumulate but is degraded in Erb1p-depleted cells. With both types of labeling (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke489f5">5</xref>, center) only a minute amount of 27S bands can be detected, whereas in control samples of non-depleted cells the 27SB products are clearly visible starting at 2 min of chase and are later converted to 25S rRNAs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke489f5">5</xref>, left). The precise pathway of pre-rRNA degradation in Erb1p-depleted cells, however, remains to be determined.</p><p> In summary, the most significant effect of Erb1p depletion in yeast cells is the absence of synthesis of 25S rRNA and 7S pre-rRNA from 27SB pre-rRNAs. This is accompanied by under-accumulation of 27SB pre-rRNAs, suggesting that either these pre-rRNAs or their immediate products are destabilized as a result of Erb1p deficiency. No other steps in pre-rRNA processing are completely blocked, although processing of 35S pre-rRNA, and possibly 27SA pre-rRNA, is delayed.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In this study we have examined the role of Erb1p, the <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> homolog of mammalian Bop1, in processing of rRNA. Gene disruption of <italic>ERB1</italic> in yeast showed that this gene is essential for cell viability. In a conditional expression system, depletion of Erb1p caused a virtually complete inhibition of synthesis of 25S and 5.8S rRNA. Synthesis of 18S rRNA in these cells was not blocked, although this rRNA was formed at a reduced rate, in agreement with the observation that defects in 25S&#x0002f;5.8S rRNA synthesis always inhibit to some extent 18S rRNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke489c1">1</xref>). The levels of 5S rRNA were not significantly affected by Erb1p depletion (data not shown). These findings are consistent with our previous observations showing that interfering with mouse Bop1 function results in inhibition of 28S and 5.8S rRNA maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke489c4">4</xref>) and suggest that Erb1p and Bop1 serve parallel functions in yeast and mammalian cells.</p><p> Analysis of pre-rRNA processing by hybridization and primer extension demonstrates that depletion of Erb1p in yeast affects multiple steps in the synthesis of 25S and 5.8S rRNAs. The first affected step appears to be cleavage of 35S pre-rRNA at site A<sub>0</sub>. Both 20S and 27SA pre-rRNA levels are decreased at least partially due to the delayed A<sub>0</sub> processing. The subsequent fate of these precursors is different: while 18S rRNA is synthesized, albeit with a reduced efficiency, no mature rRNAs are formed from 27SA pre-rRNA. The steady-state levels of different 27S pre-rRNA species decrease to varying degrees, reflecting a complex balance between their synthesis, processing and degradation rates. The most striking is depletion of 27SB pre-rRNA, which occurs largely due to under-accumulation of 27SB<sub>S</sub>. Further products of 27SB pre-rRNA processing are virtually absent in Erb1p-depleted cells, apparently due to accelerated degradation of either 27SB pre-rRNAs or their derivatives.</p><p> A number of yeast proteins have been previously shown to be involved in 25S&#x0002f;5.8S rRNA synthesis (for reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke489c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke489c2">2</xref>). Notably, depletion of some of these proteins leads to accumulation of 27SB pre-rRNA, apparently because of a delay in its further processing. Examples of such factors include Nip7p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke489c18">18</xref>), Nop56p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke489c19">19</xref>), putative methyltransferases Nop2p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke489c20">20</xref>) and Spb1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke489c21">21</xref>) and helicases Spb4p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke489c22">22</xref>), Dbp3p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke489c23">23</xref>) and Dbp10p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke489c24">24</xref>). Deficiencies in several other factors appear to increase 27S pre-rRNA turnover. For example, reduced accumulation of 27S pre-rRNA, presumably through increased degradation, was reported for depletion of Nop8p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke489c25">25</xref>); it was not, however, shown whether 27SB pre-rRNA was preferentially affected, as in Erb1p-depleted cells. Under-accumulation of 27SB pre-rRNA was observed in cells depleted for Dbp6p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke489c26">26</xref>), Dbp7p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke489c27">27</xref>) and Nop4p&#x0002f;Nop77p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke489c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke489c29">29</xref>). In these cells, however, both the B<sub>1S</sub> and B<sub>1L</sub> pathways were similarly affected and 27SA<sub>3</sub> pre-rRNA appeared to be depleted as well. The pre-rRNA processing defects produced by Erb1p depletion most closely resemble defects observed after depletion of Rlp7p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke489c30">30</xref>). Deficiency of Rlp7p similarly causes an increase in steady-state levels of 27SA<sub>3</sub> and a strong depletion of 27SB<sub>S</sub>, with a little or no effect on 27SB<sub>L</sub>. Rlp7p was proposed to function by recruiting exonucleases to the 27SA<sub>3</sub> precursor. Initiation of exonucleolytic processing at site A<sub>3</sub> might also be negatively affected by depletion of Erb1p, although the relatively small increase in 27SA<sub>3</sub> in these cells is difficult to interpret unequivocally because the A<sub>3</sub>&#x0002f;A<sub>2</sub> ratio is also altered by preferential cleavage at site A<sub>3</sub> in slowly processed 35S pre-rRNA.</p><p> While Erb1p depletion could potentially affect processing of 27SA<sub>3</sub> to 27SB<sub>S</sub>, Erb1p is not absolutely required for this step. The intensity of the primer extension stop at site B<sub>1S</sub> is reduced, but this stop is still detectable after depletion of Erb1p (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke489f7">7</xref>). Moreover, strains carrying mutations in Rat1p and Xrn1p that are unable to perform normal processing from site A<sub>3</sub> to site B<sub>1S</sub> display a ladder of aberrant RNA forms with 5&#x02032;-ends extending from B<sub>1S</sub> to A<sub>3</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke489c31">31</xref>). Similar RNAs also accumulate in a temperature-sensitive mutant of the nucleolar protein Ebp2p, which may be involved in 27SA<sub>3</sub> processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke489c32">32</xref>). No such extended forms are observed in primer extension reactions with RNA from Erb1p-depleted cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke489f7">7</xref>). We therefore favor a model in which the strong decrease in the B<sub>1S</sub> signal occurs primarily through destabilization of 27SB<sub>S</sub> pre-rRNA. One possible scenario is that Erb1p depletion may lead to misassembly of pre-ribosomal particles, whereby the 5&#x02032;&#x02192;3&#x02032; exonucleases that enter at site A<sub>3</sub> proceed to degrade pre-rRNA beyond their normal stop at site B<sub>1S</sub>. Exonucleolytic digestion initiating from the ITS1 region has been previously suggested to function as a quality control mechanism that degrades pre-rRNA in incorrectly assembled ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke489c31">31</xref>). The different mechanism of 5&#x02032;-end formation in B<sub>1L</sub> processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke489c1">1</xref>)&#x000a0;could render 27SB<sub>L</sub> pre-rRNAs less succeptible to exonucleolytic degradation, thus making their levels less affected in Erb1p-depleted cells.</p><p> The exact biochemical function of Erb1p is unknown at present. The mammalian homolog Bop1 co-fractionates with 32S pre-rRNA-containing complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke489c4">4</xref>) and forms tight, salt-resistant bonds with nucleolar RNPs (D.G.Pestov, unpublished data). Erb1p was recently identified as a component of the 66S RNP complexes isolated by purification of tagged Nop7p, which contain more than 40 proteins and appear to represent intermediates of 60S ribosome subunit assembly in yeast (P.Harnpicharnchai, J.Jakovljevic, E.Horsey, T.Miles, J.Roman, M.Rout and J.Woolford, personal communication). Remarkably, depletion of several other components of these complexes, including Nop7p, Drs1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke489c33">33</xref>) and Rlp7p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke489c30">30</xref>), also inhibits processing of 27S precursors, suggesting that cooperation between these proteins is critical for proper maturation of 27S pre-rRNA. Erb1p&#x0002f;Bop1 does not display any known RNA-binding motifs, although the presence of WD motifs suggests its participation in protein&#x02013;protein interactions. Erb1p&#x0002f;Bop1 may therefore serve as an assembly factor that coordinates protein interactions within RNPs in which processing of 27S pre-rRNA (36S&#x0002f;32S pre-rRNA in mammalian cells) takes place. Detailed analysis of interactions between Erb1p and other proteins in the Nop7p-containing complexes may provide important insights into the molecular mechanisms of formation of the 60S ribosome particle.</p><p> There is substantial similarity between effects on pre-rRNA processing caused by depletion of Erb1p in yeast cells and transdominant mutants of Bop1 in mouse cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke489c4">4</xref>). Interference with function of both genes similarly blocks formation of two components of large ribosome subunits, 25S and 5.8S rRNAs in yeast and 28S and 5.8S rRNAs in mammalian cells. The functional, as well as structural (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke489f1">1</xref>), conservation between mouse Bop1 and yeast Erb1p strongly suggests that these proteins perform similar functions in pre-rRNA processing and thus are most likely orthologous. Unfortunately, our efforts to complement Erb1p deficiency with mammalian Bop1 have been unsuccessful thus far. Despite the use of different vectors, we could not detect any expression of full-length mouse Bop1 in yeast cells, suggesting that either some presently unidentified feature of the <italic>Bop1</italic> cDNA prevents its efficient expression or the mammalian protein is rapidly degraded in yeast cells.</p><p> Disruption of Bop1 and Erb1p functions presents a unique opportunity for comparative analysis of pre-rRNA processing mechanisms in yeast and mammalian cells. Like its yeast counterpart, Bop1 has been previously implicated in processing within the ITS1 of mouse cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke489c4">4</xref>). In mammalian cells Bop1 functions were analyzed by using inducible expression of transdominant mutant Bop1&#x00394; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke489c4">4</xref>). This analysis showed that inhibition of Bop1 function slows early steps in pre-rRNA processing, but most severely affects processing of 36S and 32S pre-rRNAs, which are structurally homologous to 27SA and 27SB pre-rRNAs in yeast. In a striking similarity to the effects of Erb1p depletion in yeast, Bop1&#x00394; causes accumulation of 36S pre-rRNA and the absence of products of processing of 32S pre-rRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke489c4">4</xref>). These studies thus demonstrate a key role of Erb1p&#x0002f;Bop1 in several processing events that lead to synthesis of 25S&#x0002f;28S and 5.8S rRNA in diverse eukaryotic organisms.</p><p> We initially identified the N-terminally truncated form of Bop1, Bop1&#x00394;, in a genetic selection for reversible inhibitors of the cell cycle in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke489c16">16</xref>). Remarkably, induction of Bop1&#x00394; causes cell cycle arrest in asynchronously growing cells within one cell cycle, but it does not decrease cell viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke489c17">17</xref>). In contrast, yeast cells depleted of Erb1p continue growing at an unaltered rate for several generations, gradually slowing down only after &#x0223c;8 h of depletion (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke489f3">3</xref>). These kinetics of growth inhibition are very similar to those observed for a number of other yeast proteins whose depletion blocks rRNA synthesis.</p><p> Does Bop1 have an additional function in mammalian cells related to cell cycle control that is lacking in Erb1p? While we cannot rule out this possibility, it is notable that the Bop1 sequence does not exhibit any obvious additional domains that could account for such a function (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke489f1">1</xref>). It is possible that the difference may rather be in the fundamentally different ways that mammalian and yeast cells respond to defects in ribosome biosynthesis. The slow decline in proliferation rate of yeast cells most likely results from gradual ribosome depletion caused by distribution of pre-existing ribosomes between dividing cells and their naturally occuring degradation. In contrast, mammalian cells may have evolved a special system that monitors defects in ribosome biogenesis and blocks cell cycle progression when they are detected. We have recently proposed that this response to &#x02018;nucleolar stress&#x02019; may be a built-in protective mechanism that prevents DNA synthesis under sub-optimal conditions, thereby reducing the chances of acquiring mutations that could be deleterious in the context of a multicellular organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke489c17">17</xref>). This hypothesis is supported by the findings that inactivation of p53 abolishes the stringent cell cycle block caused by Bop1&#x00394; expression and allows for slow proliferation of cells despite a pre-rRNA processing block (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke489c17">17</xref>). These data suggest that mammalian cells possess a special checkpoint mechanism linked with ribosome biosynthesis which at least partially depends on p53. It will be extremely interesting to determine whether functional disruption of other proteins that participate in ribosome biogenesis may lead to similar cell cycle effects in mammalian cells. These studies will require broad application of the knowledge of ribosome biogenesis gained in the yeast system. The conservation of function of the proteins involved, as this study of Erb1p&#x0002f;Bop1 illustrates, should facilitate this exploration.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gke489f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Homology of the Erb1&#x0002f;Bop1 primary structure in eukaryotes.
