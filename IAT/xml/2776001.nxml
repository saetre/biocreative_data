We previously observed that mutation of a single cysteine residue of A3G (C100S) inhibited A3G packaging. In addition, several recent studies showed that mutation of tryptophan 127 (W127) and tyrosine 124 (Y124) inhibited A3G encapsidation suggesting that the N-terminal CDA constitutes a viral packaging signal in A3G. It was also reported that W127 and Y124 affect A3G oligomerization.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Here we studied the mechanistic basis of the packaging defect of A3G W127A and Y124A mutants. Interestingly, cell fractionation studies revealed a strong correlation between encapsidation, lipid raft association, and genomic RNA binding of A3G. Surprisingly, the presence of a C-terminal epitope tag affected lipid raft association and encapsidation of the A3G W127A mutant but had no effect on wt A3G encapsidation, lipid raft association, and interaction with viral genomic RNA. Mutation of Y124 abolished A3G encapsidation irrespective of the presence or absence of an epitope tag. Contrasting a recent report, our co-immunoprecipitation studies failed to reveal a correlation between A3G oligomerization and A3G encapsidation. In fact, our W127A and Y124A mutants both retained the ability to oligomerize.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our results confirm that W127 and Y124 residues in A3G are important for encapsidation into HIV-1 virions and our data establish a novel correlation between genomic RNA binding, lipid raft association, and viral packaging of A3G. In contrast, we were unable to confirm a role of W127 and Y124 in A3G oligomerization and we thus failed to confirm a correlation between A3G oligomerization and virus encapsidation.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>APOBEC3G (A3G) is a cellular cytidine deaminase with potent antiretroviral activity that severely limits replication of <italic>vif</italic>-defective HIV-1 in human cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. A3G is expressed in most if not all natural human HIV-1 target cells; yet HIV-1 efficiently infects humans and has caused a worldwide pandemic. This ability of HIV-1 to infect and replicate in A3G-positive human cells is made possible by the viral accessory protein Vif, which was found to prevent the packaging of A3G into progeny virions. Inhibition of A3G packaging is accomplished either by proteasome-mediated degradation of A3G or by other degradation-independent mechanisms (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]). Inhibition of A3G encapsidation may also require Vif dimerization since peptide antagonists to Vif dimerization blocked A3G packaging without affecting its intracellular stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>The antiviral effect of A3G generally requires encapsidation of the deaminase into viral particles. Interestingly, the antiviral effects of A3G are not limited to HIV-1 but extend to other retroviruses including murine leukemia virus, mouse mammary tumor virus, simian immunodeficiency virus, equine infectious anemia virus, and hepatitis B virus (for review see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]). Packaging of A3G into such diverse viruses suggests that virus encapsidation is either relatively nonspecific or involves signals shared by these viruses. Interestingly, although A3G selectively targets single stranded DNA for deamination it also binds RNA. RNA binding of A3G has been shown to contribute to virus encapsidation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. A3G also interacts with the NC component of the viral Gag precursor protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. This interaction likely also contributes to the packaging of A3G into viral particles. <italic>In vitro </italic>studies using purified recombinant NC and A3G found that the two proteins do not competitively bind RNA but instead form an RNA-protein ternary complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>Several reports have investigated domains in A3G required for packaging into HIV-1 virions. We and others have recently reported that mutations in the A3G catalytic domain 1 (CD1) can impair A3G packaging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Characterization of in-frame deletion mutants implicated a linker region located C-terminal to the CD1 domain (residues 121-161) as critical for A3G packaging into HIV-1 virus-like particles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. These findings were supported by other studies that identified residues 122 to 127 in the linker domain as important for A3G encapsidation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]) It is interesting to note that the adjacent D128 plays an important role in the species specific sensitivity of A3G to Vif [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Thus, the N-terminal linker region appears to be an important contact point for Vif as well as a requirement for A3G encapsidation. However, there is no conclusive evidence that these regions in A3G constitute direct Vif and/or Gag binding sites as of yet. It is equally possible that these regions impose conformational constraints on the protein that indirectly affect A3G encapsidation or modulate binding of Vif to other regions of the protein. In support of the latter possibility, Stenglein et al. have recently found that the W127A mutation has profound effects on A3G's intracellular localization only in conjunction with simultaneous mutation of Y19 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Based on structural predictions, W127 is located at the protein surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. and might therefore be available for a variety of functions including protein-protein and protein-nucleic acid interactions. Indeed, the packaging defect of the A3G W127A mutant was explained by an inability of this mutant to interact with 7SL RNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. More recently, the packaging defect of W127A and Y124A mutants was correlated with a defect in A3G oligomerization and the authors proposed that RNA-dependent oligomerization of APOBEC3G was required for restricting HIV-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p><p>Here we further characterized the role of W127 and Y124 for the packaging of A3G into HIV-1 virions and for A3G oligomerization. Consistent with previous reports we found that packaging of A3G-HA was severely affected by the W127A mutation. Similarly, packaging of Myc epitope-tagged A3G-Myc W127A was severely restricted suggesting that the packaging defect imposed by the W127A mutation is not epitope tag specific. Of note, the effect of the W127A mutation on virus encapsidation was much less severe in the context of untagged A3G. This is surprising and implies that the effects of mutations around position W127 are sensitive to and exacerbated by changes at the C-terminus of the protein. In contrast, mutation of Y124A imposed a severe packaging defect irrespective of the presence or absence of an epitope tag. A3G-HA was previously found to associate with cellular raft structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Interestingly, our results identified a novel correlation between A3G raft association and virus encapsidation. We analyzed a total of nine A3G variants and found that all packaging competent A3G variants associated with lipid rafts while all packaging incompetent A3G variants failed to do so. We further found that all packaging competent A3G variants interacted with genomic viral RNA as well as 7SL RNA while all packaging incompetent variants interacted with 7SL RNA but failed to interact with viral genomic RNA. Finally, all of our A3G variants analyzed in this study retained the ability to oligomerize irrespective of whether the A3G variant was packaging competent or not. Thus, our data clearly establish a positive correlation between packaging competence of A3G and the ability to associate with lipid rafts and to interact with viral genomic RNA. In contrast, our data failed to verify a correlation between A3G oligomerization and packaging competence. Finally, our results suggest that the presence of C-terminal epitope tags in A3G can impose conformational constraints on A3G that appear to be functionally inconsequential in the context of wild type protein but can exacerbate defects induced by changes to other regions of the protein such as mutation of W127.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Plasmids</title><p>The <italic>vif</italic>-defective molecular clone pNL4-3Vif(-)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] was used for the production of virus. Wild type human A3G carrying a C-terminal Myc epitope tag was described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. For the expression of untagged human A3G, a stop codon was introduced into pcDNA-A3G-Myc by PCR-directed mutagenesis as reported elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Mutation of tryptophan residue W127 and tyrosine residue Y124 to alanine in Myc-tagged and untagged human A3G was accomplished by PCR-based mutagenesis of pcDNA-APO3G-Myc and pcDNA-APO3G vector, respectively. The presence of the desired mutation was verified by sequence analysis. Both tagged and untagged A3G were detected by the A3G-specific ApoC17 rabbit polyclonal antibody and were distinguishable by their different mobilities in the gel. Plasmids pA3G, pA3G-HA, pA3G W127A and pA3G-HA W127A expressing untagged and C-terminally HA-tagged A3G wt and W127A mutants in the backbone of pCMV4-HA were a gift of Michael Malim [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Tissue culture and transfection</title><p>HeLa cells were propagated in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS).

A total of 5 to 6 &#x003bc;g of plasmid DNA per 25 cm<sup>2 </sup>flasks (~5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6 </sup>cells) was used. Total amounts of transfected DNA were kept constant in all samples of any given experiment by adding empty vector DNA (pUC18 or pcDNA3.1(-)MycHis) as appropriate.

Serum from an HIV-positive patient (APS) was used to detect HIV-1-specific capsid (CA) proteins. Tubulin was identified using a monoclonal antibody to &#x003b1;-tubulin (Sigma-Aldrich, Inc., St. Louis MO; Cat # T9026). For immunoprecipitation of tagged and untagged A3G, polyclonal ApoC17 antibody was used. Raft associated marker protein caveolin was identified by polyclonal anti-caveolin antibody (BD Bioscience Pharmingen, San Diego CA; Cat # 610060). Transferrin receptor (TfR) was included as a non raft marker protein and was identified using a TfR-specific monoclonal antibody (BD Bioscience Pharmingen, San Diego CA; Cat # 612125).</p></sec><sec><title>Preparation of virus stocks</title><p>Virus stocks were prepared by transfection of HeLa cells with appropriate plasmid DNAs of pNL4-3Vif(-) in the presence of tagged and untagged variants of wild type and mutant (W127A, Y124A) A3G as indicated in the text. Virus-containing supernatants were harvested 24 h after transfection. Cellular debris was removed by centrifugation (3 min, 3,000 &#x000d7; g) and clarified supernatants were filtered (0.45 &#x003bc;m) to remove residual cellular contaminants. For determination of viral infectivity, unconcentrated filtered supernatants were used for the infection of LuSIV indicator cells. For immunoblot analysis of viral protein, virus-containing supernatants (7 ml) were concentrated by ultracentrifugation through 4 ml of 20% sucrose in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Infectivity assay</title><p>To determine viral infectivity, virus stocks were normalized for equal levels of reverse transcriptase activity and used to infect LuSIV cells (5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup>) in a 24-well plate in a total volume of 1.2 to 1.4 ml. LuSIV cells are derived from CEMx174 cells and contain a luciferase indicator gene under the control of the SIVmac239 long terminal repeat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. These cells were obtained from Janice Clements through the NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program (catalog # 5460) and were maintained in complete RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS and hygromycin B (300 &#x003bc;g/ml).

To determine the luciferase activity in the lysates, 50 &#x003bc;l of each lysate was combined with luciferase substrate (Promega.

Proteins were solubilized by boiling for 10 to 15 min at 95&#x000b0;C, with occasional vortexing of the samples to shear cellular DNA. Residual insoluble material was removed by centrifugation (2 min, 15,000 rpm, in an Eppendorf Minifuge). For immunoblot analysis of virus-associated proteins, concentrated viral pellets were suspended in a 1:1 mixture of PBS and sample buffer and boiled. Cell lysates and viral extracts were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene diflouride membranes and reacted with appropriate antibodies as described in the text.

For the Y124A mutant the presence or absence of a C-terminal Myc tag was investigated; A3G W127A constructs encoding either a C-terminal Myc tag or an HA tag were analyzed. Amounts of transfected A3G vectors were adjusted as described in the legend to figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> to minimize differences in expression or stability of the proteins (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, cell). All DNAs were cotransfected into HeLa cells together with an equal amount of <italic>vif</italic>-defective proviral DNA (pNL4-3Vif(-)) and total amounts of transfected DNA were kept constant. Surprisingly, epitope-tagged A3G W127A variants were much less efficiently packaged into virions than their untagged counterparts (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, compare lanes 5 &#x00026; 7 to lanes 6 &#x00026; 8). In contrast, A3G Y124A was packaging incompetent irrespective of the present or absence of a C-terminal Myc tag (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, lanes 9 &#x00026; 10). Thus, the presence of a C-terminal epitope tag, irrespective of its nature (i.e Myc versus HA), reduced the packaging efficiency of W127A mutants by 40- to 60-fold when compared to untagged A3G wt.</p><p>Consistent with their poor packaging efficiency, tagged and untagged Y124A mutants as well as epitope tagged A3G W127A mutants exhibited only modest antiviral activity in the context of Vif-defective viruses (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, lanes 8, 10, 11 &#x00026; 12), while untagged A3G W127A strongly inhibited viral infectivity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, lanes 7 &#x00026; 9). As expected, viruses produced in the presence of A3G wt were non-infectious, irrespective of the presence or absence of a C-terminal epitope tag (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, lanes 3-6).

Since lipid rafts are important for HIV-1 assembly and release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] we investigated a possible correlation between lipid raft-association and packaging competence of A3G. For this purpose, HeLa cells were transfected with A3G expression vectors encoding untagged and epitope-tagged A3G wt, Y124A, and W127A mutants (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). In addition, we included the A3G-Myc C100S mutant as an independent control since it was previously found to be poorly packaged into HIV-1 virions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Cells were harvested 20 h after transfection and processed for floatation analysis as described in the Methods section. As judged from the migration of the lipid raft marker protein caveolin, detergent-insensitive raft-associated proteins were enriched in fractions 2-4 of our floatation gradient (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, panel 10). Soluble, detergent-sensitive proteins remained at the bottom of the gradient (fractions 9-10) as exemplified by the migration of transferrin receptor protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, panel 11 TfR). We found that A3G wt associated with lipid rafts irrespective of the presence or absence of a C-terminal epitope tag (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, panels 1 - 3); however, not all of the protein was detergent resistant, consistent with a previous report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Similarly, untagged A3G W127A partitioned with lipid rafts (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, panel 4). Interestingly, all five packaging-defective A3G variants, i.e. A3G-Myc W127A, A3G-HA W127A, A3G Y124A, A3G-Myc Y124A, and A3G-Myc C100S, failed to associate with lipid rafts (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, panels 5 - 8). Thus, 4 out of 4 packaging competent A3G variants associated with lipid rafts while 5 out of 5 packaging-incompetent variants failed to associate with lipid rafts. These results establish a strong correlation between lipid raft association and packaging competence of A3G.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Floatation analysis of A3G</bold>.

However, there was some discussion about the nature of the RNA mediating A3G encapsidation. One study reported that the packaging defect of A3G W127A was caused by a lack of interaction with 7SL RNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Other reports including our own argued against a role of 7SL RNA in the packaging of A3G and identified viral genomic RNA as a critical cofactor for A3G encapsidation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. To assess the importance of W127 and Y124 for interaction with 7SL RNA and/or genomic RNA, we performed a pull-down experiment to identify 7SL RNA and genomic RNA in immunocomplexes of A3G. The impact of a C-terminal epitope tag was assessed using Myc-tagged A3G variants. A3G variants were individually transfected into HeLa cells together with pNL4-3vif(-) DNA as a source of genomic RNA. Transfection conditions were adjusted to ascertain equal expression of all four A3G variants. Cell lysates were prepared 24 h after transfection and used for immunoprecipitation with an A3G-specific antibody. Input material (total cell lysates) and immunoprecipitates were subsequently subjected to immunoblot analysis using an A3G-specific antibody (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>, top panel). A sample lacking A3G was included as control (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>, lane 1). All A3G variants were expressed at similar levels (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>, lanes 2-7) and were precipitated by the A3G-specific antibody with similar efficiency (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>, lower panel). Equal samples of the cell lysates and of the immunoprecipitates were used for extraction of total RNA. 7SL RNA and genomic RNA levels in total lysates (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>) or in immunoprecipitates (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>) were determined by qRT-PCR as described in Methods. As expected, amplification of input samples resulted in very similar signals for 7SL RNA and genomic RNA in all samples (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). Immunoprecipitation of the A3G-deficient sample with the A3G-specific antibody neither pulled down 7SL RNA nor genomic RNA, attesting to the specificity of the immunoselection (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>, Ctrl). A3G wt interacted with both 7SL and viral genomic RNA and this interaction was independent of the presence or absence of an epitope tag (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>, A3G +/-). Importantly, treatment of A3G wt samples with RNaseA abolished amplification of 7SL and genomic RNA attesting to the absence of contaminating DNA in the RNA preparations (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>, RNase). All four A3G variants including A3G-Myc W127A immunoprecipitated similar levels of 7SL RNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>, W127A &#x00026; Y124A, grey bars). In contrast, only untagged A3G W127A precipitated wild type levels of viral RNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>, W127A (-)Myc, black bar) while packaging incompetent A3G variants were severely compromised in their ability to bind viral genomic RNA. These results suggest that viral genomic RNA selectively associates with packaging competent A3G, which is consistent with our previous observations on the importance of viral genomic RNA in the packaging of A3G [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Packaging incompetent A3G variants are defective for binding viral RNA</bold>. <bold>(A-C) </bold>HeLa cells were transfected with 4 &#x003bc;g of empty vector DNA (lane 1), 2 &#x003bc;g of either Myc-tagged or untagged A3G wt (lanes 2 &#x00026; 3, respectively), 4 &#x003bc;g of A3G-Myc W127A (lane 4), 2 &#x003bc;g of A3G W127A (lane 5), 2 &#x003bc;g of Y124A (lane 6), or 3 &#x003bc;g of A3G-Myc Y124A (lane 7).

Proteins were immunoprecipitated by a Myc-specific monoclonal antibody followed by immunoblotting with a polyclonal A3G-specific antibody (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, middle panel). Total lysates were also probed with an A3G-specific antibody as an input control (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>, top panel).

There is increasing evidence that encapsidation of A3G into virions requires interactions with the viral nucleocapsid domain in the Gag precursor and involves RNA although the nature of the RNA involved in A3G packaging, i.e. cellular versus viral, remains under investigation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. There is only limited information concerning sequences in A3G that are necessary and sufficient for viral encapsidation. Several studies implicated the N-terminal catalytic domain (CD1) in A3G in RNA interaction and virus encapsidation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Other studies found that sequences in the N-terminal linker domain downstream of the CD1 domain encompassing residues 122 to 127 were critical for A3G packaging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. However, it remains unclear whether this latter domain represents a direct contact point for protein-protein or protein-RNA interactions or simply represents a conformationally sensitive area in the protein.</p><p>Our current study focused on two amino acid residue, W127 and Y124, in A3G to demonstrate that the requirements for A3G packaging are complex and can be influenced by the presence or absence of terminal epitope tags. Our finding that untagged A3G W127A was packaged 10 times more efficient than Myc- or HA-tagged A3G W127A was surprising and unexpected since the interfering epitope tags were not located adjacent to residue W127 but were more than 250 amino acids away at the C-terminus of the protein. There is currently no structure of full-length A3G available. However, computer modelling suggests that W127 is located at the surface of the protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. It is therefore possible that in 3-dimensional space the C-terminus of A3G is in close proximity to the N-terminal linker region surrounding residue W127. Therefore, changes in this region could, in the context of an epitope-tag, induce changes in the protein resulting in mislocalization in the cell - as evidenced by differential raft association - and culminating in the exclusion of A3G from virions. Importantly, the epitope tag effect was not tag specific since identical results were obtained with C-terminal Myc and HA tags. Based on these data we consider it possible that W127 in A3G is critical for proper protein folding/conformation and/or cellular localization of the protein rather than representing a motif required for viral encapsidation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our data reveal an interesting correlation between A3G's propensity to associate with lipid raft structures, viral RNA interaction, and packaging competence. The reason for the inability of the epitope tagged A3G W127A mutants as well as tagged and untagged Y124A mutants to associate with lipid rafts and with viral RNA remains to be investigated. Since A3G is not a membrane protein it is likely that its affinity to raft structures is due to an interaction with other raft associated host factors. Our floatation studies were done in the absence of viral proteins, ruling out the possible contribution of Gag protein in the raft targeting of A3G. Thus, the lack of raft association could be indicative of altered intracellular localization or trafficking of A3G or could be due to a conformational change resulting in the loss of protein-protein interaction.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>MAK conceived the study, performed the molecular and biochemical studies, and drafted the manuscript.
