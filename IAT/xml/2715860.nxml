We analyzed systematically the expression of neurotrophic factors and receptors following RSV infection of human nasal, tracheal, and bronchial epithelial cells, and tested the hypothesis that neurotrophins work as innate survival factors for infected respiratory epithelia.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology</title><p>Expression of neurotrophic factors (nerve growth factor, NGF; brain-derived neurotrophic factor, BDNF) and receptors (trkA, trkB, p75) was analyzed at the protein level by immunofluorescence and flow cytometry and at the mRNA level by real-time PCR. Targeted siRNA was utilized to blunt NGF expression, and its effect on virus-induced apoptosis/necrosis was evaluated by flow cytometry following annexin V/7-AAD staining.</p></sec><sec><title>Principal Findings</title><p>RSV infection was more efficient in cells from more distal (bronchial) vs. more proximal origin. In bronchial cells, RSV infection induced transcript and protein overexpression of NGF and its high-affinity receptor trkA, with concomitant downregulation of the low-affinity p75<sup>NTR</sup>. In contrast, tracheal cells exhibited an increase in BDNF, trkA and trkB, and nasal cells increased only trkA. RSV-infected bronchial cells transfected with NGF-specific siRNA exhibited decreased trkA and increased p75<sup>NTR</sup> expression. Furthermore, the survival of bronchial epithelial cells was dramatically decreased when their endogenous NGF supply was depleted prior to RSV infection.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>RSV infection of the distal airway epithelium, but not of the more proximal sections, results in overexpression of NGF and its trkA receptor, while the other p75<sup>NTR</sup> receptor is markedly downregulated. This pattern of neurotrophin expression confers protection against virus-induced apoptosis, and its inhibition amplifies programmed cell death in the infected bronchial epithelium. Thus, pharmacologic modulation of NGF expression may offer a promising new approach for management of common respiratory infections.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The most common agent of lower respiratory infections in early childhood is respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006444-Panitch1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006444-Piedimonte1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006444-Psarras1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.

It is common knowledge that naturally occurring RSV infections in humans initiate in the nasal region, and in young children frequently spread through the trachea and finally establish in the bronchial tree. The individual cellular responses to RSV may differ both quantitatively and qualitatively among different anatomical regions of the respiratory system, but specific information is difficult to obtain because most clinical data are derived from lavage samples collected from the upper <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006444-McNamara1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref> or lower airways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006444-Tortorolo1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref> of RSV-infected patients, therefore pooling together information from different sections of the respiratory tract and bypassing others.</p><p>Thus, in this study we evaluated human cell lines deriving from nasal, tracheal or bronchial epithelium, studied their individual susceptibility to RSV infection, and systematically quantified the effects of the infection on the transcript and protein expression of different neurotrophic factors and receptors by immunocytochemistry, flow cytometry, and real-time PCR. Extending these studies, we also explored the functional consequences of selective NGF knock-out by siRNA in infected respiratory epithelia, and specifically tested the hypothesis that this neurotrophin contributes to an innate survival strategy deployed by cells being infected against the invading virus, thereby modulating the pathological and clinical manifestations of the infection.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Virus</title><p>RSV derived from RSV-A<sub>2</sub> expressing the gene for green fluorescent protein (rgRSV) was a kind gift of Dr. Mark E. Peeples (Columbus Children Research Institute, Columbus, OH) and Dr. Peter Collins (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD). Cultivation and harvesting of rgRSV was performed as described previously. Briefly, virus was serially diluted and added to HEp-2 cell monolayers in 96 well-plates. Cells were incubated for 22 h and green cells were counted by fluorescent microscopy. RSV titer was determined in a modified plaque-forming unit (PFU) assay, and was calculated as follows: (number of infectious units)&#x000d7;(inverse of dilution)/(volume of inoculum). The stock titer of the virus pool used in the current study was 4.7&#x000d7;10<sup>6</sup> PFU/ml. To confirm that the observed effects were caused by actively replicating virus and not by exposure to constituents of the virion or culture medium, selected experiments were performed using aliquots of rgRSV irradiated with a UV light source for 20 min to inactivate the viral nucleic acid <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006444-Haeberle1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Cell lines</title><p>Human nasal, tracheal, and bronchial epithelial cells from multiple donors were purchased from PromoCell (Heidelberg, Germany) and were maintained in the recommended media and supplements provided by the vendor. Each experiment was repeated using cells from different donors throughout the study to control for host genetics and environment. The number of passage times for each airway section was matched in each experiment and it never exceeded 5 passages. As 100&#x00025; confluency alters the cells morphology, we performed our experiments in cells that were 70&#x02013;80&#x00025; confluent at the time of the infection with rgRSV at MOI (multiplicity of infection) ranging from 1 to 10.

TrkB and p75<sup>NTR</sup> antibodies were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA). TrkA and isotype control goat IgG conjugated with allophycocyanin (APC) were obtained from R&#x00026;D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). The additional isotype control rabbit IgG was purchased from Southern Biotechnology (Birmingham, AL). We used antibodies conjugated with APC or phycoerythrin (PE) because the virus was labeled with green fluorescent protein (GFP). For cell death analysis, gating was adjusted using cyanine 3 (Cy3) or 7-aminoactinomycin D (7-AAD) staining with dot plots displaying FL3-7-AAD on the y-axis and FL2-Cy3 on the x-axis, and 10,000 events were collected for each sample. The five parameters simultaneously collected were linear forward-angle light scatter (FSC), linear side scatter (SSC), log FITC, log Cy3, and log 7-AAD.

Therefore, it is conceivable that the anti-apoptotic activity of NGF may, especially in conditions of relative immunological weakness, allow the persistence of low-grade RSV infection, thus providing a plausible pathophysiologic mechanism for post-bronchiolitis asthma in children and COPD in elderly adults. This hypothesis may also have important translational implications, as the selective molecular targeting of NGF during latent infections would become critical for the management of the chronic sequelae of RSV infection by improving the efficiency of viral clearance.</p><p>In conclusion, our data suggest that RSV infection of the distal (bronchial) airway epithelium, but not of the more proximal (nasal and tracheal) sections, results in overexpression of NGF and its trkA receptor, while the other p75<sup>NTR</sup> receptor is markedly downregulated. This pattern of neurotrophin expression confers protection against virus-induced apoptosis, and its inhibition via RNA interference amplifies programmed cell death in the infected bronchial epithelium. The different patterns of neurotrophin expression observed between cells of proximal and distal origin also imply that the biological mechanisms of RSV infection need to be carefully considered across anatomically distinct regions, as the cellular responses to this virus are significantly different. Pharmacologic modulation of neurotrophic factors or receptors, for example using novel strategies based on RNA interference methodology, may offer a promising new approach for the management of this common respiratory infection, although additional basic and clinical research work is needed.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Dr. Mario Scuri for helping with the statistical analysis of the data.
