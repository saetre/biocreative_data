Their transposition is activated at high frequencies during I-R hybrid dysgenesis and is associated with the production of mutations of various sorts. Very few of these mutations have been studied at the molecular level; those reported so far result either from chromosomal rearrangements or from insertions of complete I factors. We have analysed three I-R induced yellow mutations and have found that one of them is due to the insertion of an I element very similar to the complete I factor, whereas the other two are due to insertions of I elements that are truncated at their 5' ends; one of them exhibits an unusual 3' end. We discuss possible mechanisms of production of such modified I elements.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00134-0174-a" xlink:role="6941"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00134-0172.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6939"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00134-0173.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6940"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00134-0174.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6941"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00134-0175.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6942"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00134-0176.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6943"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00134-0177.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6944"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00134-0178.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6945"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
