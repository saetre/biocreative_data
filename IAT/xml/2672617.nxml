In <named-content content-type="genus-species">Caenorhabditis elegans</named-content>, two parallel and partially redundant conserved pathways act in cell-corpse engulfment. One pathway includes the adaptor protein CED-2 CrkII and the small GTPase CED-10 Rac, and acts to rearrange the cytoskeleton of the engulfing cell. The other pathway includes the receptor tyrosine kinase CED-1 and might recruit membranes to extend the surface of the engulfing cell. Although many components required for engulfment have been identified, little is known about inhibition of engulfment. The tyrosine kinase Abl regulates the actin cytoskeleton in mammals and <italic>Drosophila</italic> in multiple ways. For example, Abl inhibits cell migration via phosphorylation of CrkII. We tested whether ABL-1, the <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. elegans</named-content> ortholog of Abl, inhibits the CED-2 CrkII-dependent engulfment of apoptotic cells. Our genetic studies indicate that ABL-1 inhibits apoptotic cell engulfment, but not through CED-2 CrkII, and instead acts in parallel to the two known engulfment pathways. The CED-10 Rac pathway is also required for proper migration of the distal tip cells (DTCs) during the development of the <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. elegans</named-content> gonad. The loss of ABL-1 function partially restores normal DTC migration in the CED-10 Rac pathway mutants. We found that ABI-1 the <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. elegans</named-content> homolog of mammalian Abi (Abl interactor) proteins, is required for engulfment of apoptotic cells and proper DTC migration. Like Abl, Abi proteins are cytoskeletal regulators. ABI-1 acts in parallel to the two known engulfment pathways, likely downstream of ABL-1. ABL-1 and ABI-1 interact physically in vitro. We propose that ABL-1 opposes the engulfment of apoptotic cells by inhibiting ABI-1 via a pathway that is distinct from the two known engulfment pathways.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>Cell death or apoptosis is a normal part of animal development, as is the engulfment and removal of dead cells by other cells.

Little is known, however, about how engulfment is inhibited. In mammals, the tyrosine kinase Abl, which regulates the actin cytoskeleton and which when misexpressed causes two types of leukemia, prevents the CrkII protein from facilitating cell migration.

In one model, ABL-1 acts through different molecular pathways to inhibit the morphological changes that drive engulfment of apoptotic cells and to inhibit the migration of DTCs, i.e., ABL-1 acts directly on CED-10 or another protein in the CED-10 Rac pathway in engulfment and on a different set of proteins in DTC migration. Alternatively, ABL-1 acts in a pathway distinct from the CED-10 Rac pathway but common to both processes, and this common pathway is more important in DTC migration than in engulfment. For example, in gonadal cell migration, either the CED-10 Rac pathway or a second ABL-1<italic>-</italic>inhibited pathway might be sufficient for normal DTC migration. If this were the case, loss of ABL-1 function would derepress the ABL-1-regulated pathway and suppress DTC migration defects even in the absence of any CED-10 Rac pathway function, as we observed. In engulfment, the requirement for the CED-10 Rac pathway might not be able to be overcome by derepression of the ABL-1-regulated pathway.

Since <italic>abl-1</italic> mutation modulated DTC migration in the absence of <italic>ced-5</italic> or <italic>ced-12</italic> function (i.e., when the CED-10 Rac pathway was inactive), ABL-1 can signal through another pathway. We propose that ABL-1 acts in a third pathway not only for DTC migration but also for engulfment. If so, this pathway cannot promote engulfment in the absence of CED-10 Rac activation. Although it is formally possible that the function of ABL-1 in engulfment is mediated through the CED-10 Rac pathway while its effect on DTC migration is mediated through a different pathway, we prefer a simpler model in which ABL-1 acts through a single pathway to oppose the engulfment genes. This pathway might act in parallel to CED-10 or it might act on CED-10 Rac (see below).</p><p>We found that ABI-1 is required for the function of ABL-1 in engulfment and DTC migration. ABI-1 promoted engulfment and migration independently of the known engulfment pathways downstream of or in parallel to ABL-1.

Interestingly, loss of <italic>abl-1</italic> did not suppress the engulfment defects of CED-10 Rac pathway null mutants, whereas loss of <italic>abi-1</italic> did enhance those engulfment defects. At least three models can explain these findings. ABL-1 might not be a sufficiently potent inhibitor of ABI-1 to affect engulfment in the absence of CED-10 Rac pathway activity. Second, the CED-10 Rac pathway might be absolutely required for engulfment, so that derepressing the ABL-1/ABI-1 pathway does not suppress the CED-10 Rac pathway engulfment defect. Third, loss of <italic>abl-1</italic> function might increase engulfment activity in the absence of the CED-10 Rac pathway insufficiently to detect in the engulfment assay.</p><p>Loss of <italic>abl-1</italic> function suppressed the DTC migration defect of a null <italic>ced-10</italic> mutant. However, these animals were the progeny of heterozygotes and probably contained some functional CED-10 protein. Loss of <italic>abl-1</italic> function suppressed the maternal-effect lethality of a <italic>ced-10</italic> null mutation. This observation provides stronger evidence that <italic>abl-1</italic> can act in parallel to or downstream of <italic>ced-10</italic>. We were unable to test the effects of <italic>abl-1</italic> or <italic>abi-1</italic> mutations on a null mutant of <italic>dyn-1,</italic> because this mutant arrests development during embryogenesis and, unlike in the case of a null <italic>ced-10</italic> mutant, DTC migration is not affected in <italic>dyn-1</italic> mutants. Therefore, we do not know whether ABL-1 or ABI-1 can act independently of CED-10 or DYN-1 for engulfment or engulfment-mediated programmed cell death (or DTC migration in the case of CED-10) and hence whether ABL-1 and ABI-1 act through either of these genes or in a parallel molecular pathway. We think it unlikely that ABL-1 and ABI-1 act through DYN-1<italic>,</italic> since the CED-1 pathway has no known role in DTC migration, and ABL-1 and ABI-1 modulate DTC migration defects.</p><p>There are at least three models for how the ABL-1 and ABI-1 proteins act in engulfment and DTC migration. First, ABL-1 might directly inhibit ABI-1 from promoting engulfment of apoptotic cells and inappropriate DTC migration through a molecular pathway that acts in parallel to the known engulfment gene pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000099-g008">Figure 8</xref>). Second, ABI-1 might act on CED-10 Rac in parallel to the CED-5/CED-12 heterodimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000099-g008">Figure 8</xref>). These models are not mutually exclusive. In a third model, the CED-10 Rac pathway and ABL-1 both act on ABI-1 in parallel to each other, with CED-10 Rac activating ABI-1 and ABL-1 inhibiting it. Studies of mammalian Abi proteins are consistent with the first two models. For example, Abi proteins are found in complexes with N-WASP &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000099-b060">60</xref>&#x0005d; and the Formins &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000099-b059">59</xref>&#x0005d;.

ABI-1 might signal either independently of the CED-10 Rac pathway (Arrow 1) or through CED-10 Rac, in parallel to the CED-10 GEF CED-5/CED-12 (Arrow 2). This model also applies to the roles of ABL-1 and ABI-1 in the regulation of DTC migration, but we do not show DTC migration in the figure, because the CED-1 pathway does not act in this process. Since ABL-1 and ABI-1 act in DTC migration, ABL-1/ABI-1 cannot act solely through the CED-1 pathway since the proteins of the CED-1 pathway have no role in DTC migration.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pbio.1000099.g008"/></fig></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Why Negatively Regulate Engulfment?</title><p>Despite the large number of genes known to be involved in engulfment, only a few negatively regulate the process. Loss of SWAN-1, a CED-10-binding protein, suppresses the engulfment and DTC migration defects caused by <italic>ced-10</italic> loss of function, and SWAN-1 thus might be a negative regulator of these processes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000099-b070">70</xref>&#x0005d;. In mammalian macrophages and macrophage cell lines, the small GTPase Rho and one of its effectors, Rho-kinase, negatively regulate engulfment of apoptotic cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000099-b071">71</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000099-b072">72</xref>&#x0005d;.

All Rac proteins are downregulated by Rac-specific GTPases (RacGAPs) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000099-b073">73</xref>&#x0005d;. No RacGAPs have been identified that function in engulfment, though presumably one or more will be found.</p><p>Pathways that inhibit engulfment might prevent the inappropriate engulfment of healthy cells that are not programmed to die. There are examples of inappropriate engulfment of mammalian cells. In entosis, cells engulf and eventually kill neighboring cells that have lost their attachments to the extracellular matrix &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000099-b074">74</xref>&#x0005d;. Also, the glycosylated surface protein SIRP&#x003b1; is found on engulfing cells and interacts with the integrin-associated protein CD47 on other viable cells. When that interaction is disrupted, inappropriate engulfment occurs &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000099-b075">75</xref>&#x0005d;. Notably, the intracellular cascades that transduce these signaling events have not been discovered. Possibly <italic>abl-1</italic> transduces these types of signals.</p><p>Perhaps there are conditions that cause cells to be particularly sensitive to engulfment, and without such negative regulatory pathways cells would be inappropriately killed. Since engulfment promotes the cell-killing process, several of the situations in which engulfment occurs could be severely affected by such excess cell death: organismal development, wound healing and infection control.</p><p>Targeting signaling pathways that negatively regulate engulfment might have therapeutic benefits. For example, inducing professional engulfing cells, such as macrophages, to engulf diseased cells, such as cancerous cells or those infected with viruses or bacteria, could aid in combating these disease processes. Also, in humans impaired engulfment of apoptotic cells has been associated with systemic lupus erthematosus (SLE) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000099-b076">76</xref>&#x0005d; and in mice, ineffective engulfment of apoptotic cells can cause an SLE-like syndrome &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000099-b077">77</xref>&#x0005d;.
