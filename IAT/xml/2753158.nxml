Outer and inner membrane tethering is mediated by the self assembly of mitochondrial fusion DRPs via intermolecular interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ishihara et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Koshiba et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Meeusen et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Griffin and Chan, 2006</xref>).

Fzo1/Mfn1/2 possess two medial transmembrane domains that target and anchor them in the mitochondrial outer membrane and place the critical GTPase and coiled-coil regions in the cytosol, with a short loop in the intermembrane space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hermann et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rapaport et al., 1998</xref>).

In mammalian cells, dissipation of membrane potential is associated with increased proteolysis of l-Opa1 isoforms, which leads to an attenuation of mitochondrial fusion and thus the linking of mitochondrial function and fusion to facilitate the separation of dysfunctional mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Duvezin-Caubet et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Griparic et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Song et al., 2007</xref>).

We examined the ability of s- and l-Mgm1 to hydrolyze GTP, which for DRPs depends on self-assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Danino and Hinshaw, 2001</xref>). We observed no detectable GTPase activity for s- or l-Mgm1 over a range of protein and GTP concentrations (unpublished data; s-Mgm1 0.03 min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>; l-Mgm1 0.00 min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>). Hydrodynamic analysis of s- or l-Mgm1 by sucrose gradient centrifugation and gel filtration chromatography revealed that both exist as monomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>). In contrast to Mgm1, the membrane division DRPs&#x02014;Dnm1 and dynamin&#x02014;exist as stable dimers, which in their unassembled form possess a basal rate of GTP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ingerman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ramachandran et al., 2007</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>s-Mgm1 assembly is regulated by CL.</bold> (A) Purified l- and s-Mgm1 (40 pmol of each) analyzed by SDS-PAGE.

This analysis indicated that s-Mgm1 preferentially associates with liposomes whose composition mimics the inner mitochondrial membrane composition (IMC) as compared with liposomes with an outer membrane composition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>, OMC 6% CL vs. IMC 20% CL, composition described in Materials and methods). These data indicate that the critical lipid species required for s-Mgm1 association with IMC liposomes was the inner membrane&#x02013;enriched dianionic phospholipid, CL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>, IMC 20% CL vs. IMC 0% CL; and not depicted).</p><p>Association of s-Mgm1 with CL-containing IMC liposomes stimulated GTP hydrolysis in a CL-dependent manner, to a maximal velocity of 1.3 min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>, compare IMC 20% CL vs. IMC 0% CL). When compared with other DRPs this is relatively slow, but it is similar to recently published kinetic data for assembled s-Mgm1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Meglei and McQuibban, 2009</xref>). Although CL is enriched in the inner membrane, biochemical analysis of mitochondria indicates that it may also comprise up to 6% of the outer membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sperka-Gottlieb et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Daum and Vance, 1997</xref>). In the presence of OMC liposomes containing up to 6% CL, s-Mgm1 was significantly less active as compared with s-Mgm1 in the presence of IMC 20% CL liposomes, which is consistent with its role in inner membrane fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Meeusen et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>These observations suggest that CL-containing liposomes stimulate self-assembly of s-Mgm1. To test this possibility, we chemically cross-linked s-Mgm1 in the presence and absence of CL-containing IMC membranes with bis(sulfosuccinimidyl)suberate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 E</xref>, BS3). Analysis of cross-linked products revealed that s-Mgm1 dimers and tetramers form in a CL-specific manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 E</xref>). These data indicate that dimeric s-Mgm1 is the building block for the assembly of larger structures, which is consistent with previous cross-linking analysis of Mgm1 and Opa1, and further suggests that the formation of a DRP dimer interface is required for GTP hydrolysis and is a general property of the DRP family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Frezza et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gasper et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Meglei and McQuibban, 2009</xref>).</p><p>Thus, in contrast to membrane division DRPs, our data indicate that the s-Mgm1 monomer-to-dimer assembly step is regulated by CL. CL-saturated detergent micelles did not activate s-Mgm1 GTP hydrolysis, indicating that CL stimulates s-Mgm1 self assembly only in the context of a lipid bilayer, which may serve as a 2D platform for the stimulation of s-Mgm1 assembly (unpublished data). This CL membrane regulatory step has likely been harnessed in vivo to couple inner membrane targeting of Mgm1 to its assembly and activation, which is critical given that s-Mgm1 has access to both mitochondrial membranes.</p></sec><sec><title>Short Mgm1 assembles into a parallel dimer that further assembles into a novel DRP structure</title><p>To gain insight into organization of assembled s-Mgm1 structures, we examined IMC liposomes containing s-Mgm1 by negative-stain EM. This analysis revealed that in the absence of nucleotide, s-Mgm1 associates with CL-liposomes and self-assembles into an extended, organized lattice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 F</xref>). The structural features of this lattice are striking in their novelty for a DRP. Division DRPs form curved filaments or helical structures in the absence or presence of GTP, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ingerman et al., 2005</xref>). In the presence of GTP or nonhydrolyzable GTP analogues, s-Mgm1 remained associated with IMC liposomes, but s-Mgm1 lattices were not observed, indicating that GTP binding and hydrolysis facilitates conformational changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 F</xref> and not depicted).</p><p>The uniform organization of the s-Mgm1 lattice prompted us to attempt 2D crystallization of s-Mgm1 on CL-containing monolayers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>). Crystals of &#x0223c;1 &#x000b5;m were obtained and imaged as negative-stained preparations in the transmission EM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>). The calculated power spectrum of recorded 2D crystal images showed diffraction spots with up to 3 nm resolution before image unbending. Comparison of phase residuals with the ALLSPACE program revealed a P3 symmetry. The unit cell parameters were a = b = 200 &#x000c5;, &#x003b3; = 120&#x000b0;. A total of eight images from the nontilted images were merged in 2dx_merge, yielding a projection map at 3.1 nm resolution (overall phase residual: 29.4&#x000b0; [IQ weighted]; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>). Six images of 30&#x000b0; tilted and nine images of 45&#x000b0; tilted negatively stained s-Mgm1 2D crystals were collected and merged with the nontilted data, yielding a 3D reconstruction at 3.1 nm resolution, applying P3 symmetry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>). This 3D reconstruction showed a trimer of densities that clearly separated into dimers at higher contouring thresholds that were assembled in a hexameric ringlike structure. This structural model is consistent with our cross-linking data, which indicates that a dimer is the building block for self assembly of higher-order structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 E</xref>).

Our structural model of assembled s-Mgm1 also predicts that an open interface exists, which contains the helical region that is likely orthologous to HR2 in Mfn1, proposed to mediate trans interactions responsible for membrane tethering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Koshiba et al., 2004</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>l-Mgm1 preferentially associates with and reconstitutes into liposomes containing CL, but cannot hydrolyze GTP</title><p>Similar to s-Mgm1, l-Mgm1 was preferentially inserted into the bilayer of IMC liposomes containing CL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>, IMC 20% CL vs. IMC 0% CL).

Full kinetic analysis of GTP hydrolysis revealed that either s-Mgm1 with liposomes or s-Mgm1 together with inserted l-Mgm1 are positively cooperative with respect to GTP, which is consistent with their coassembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 B</xref>).</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p><bold>l-Mgm1 stimulates s-Mgm1 GTPase activity.</bold> (A) Kinetics of GTP hydrolysis of l-Mgm1, s-Mgm1, and l- + s-Mgm1 (s-Mgm1, 0.5 &#x000b5;M; l-Mgm1, 0.3 &#x000b5;M).

Consistent with our in vivo analysis, synergistic stimulation of GTP hydrolysis was observed in reactions containing s-Mgm1 and l-Mgm1<sup>S224A</sup>, but not in those containing the reciprocal combination of s-Mgm1<sup>S224A</sup> and l-Mgm1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 C</xref>). These data are consistent with our model that l- and s-Mgm1 assemble together to form a functional unit required for mitochondrial fusion. Our data further demonstrate that within assembled l-Mgm1/s-Mgm1 structures, the s-Mgm1 GTPase domain is activated. Thus, although l-Mgm1 is not able to hydrolyze GTP, it can assemble with and activate the GTPase domain of s-Mgm1.</p><p>We also examined how l- and s-Mgm1 interact within mitochondria during fusion in vitro. Previously, under outer membrane fusion conditions in vitro, we observed a physical Mgm1&#x02013;Mgm1 interaction from opposing inner membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wong et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Meeusen et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">2006</xref>). Using our <italic>MGM1</italic> constructs engineered to separately express s- and l-Mgm1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>), we resolved whether l- and s-Mgm1 interactions occur on the same membrane and/or on opposing inner membranes in outer membrane fused mitochondria. We mixed mitochondria isolated from cells expressing l-Mgm1-HA and s-Mgm1-FLAG with mitochondria expressing l-Mgm1-FLAG, and after chemical cross-linking under stage 1 conditions, we immunoprecipitated Mgm1 using anti-HA antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 D</xref>, see schematic). Western analysis indicated that in outer membrane fused intermediates, l-Mgm1 interacts with l-Mgm1 on opposing inner membranes, and s-Mgm1 interacts with l-Mgm1 on the same membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 D</xref>). In analogous immunoprecipitation experiments, s-Mgm1 interacted with s-Mgm1 on opposing inner membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 E</xref>). These data confirm that s- and l-Mgm1 interact with each other across adjacent inner membranes, as well as within the same membrane in mitochondrial fusion intermediates that are arrested at and poised to undergo inner membrane fusion.</p><p>Together, our genetic, biochemical, and structural data suggest a model in which the assembly of heterotypic l-/s-Mgm1 structures facilitates the fusion of the mitochondrial inner membrane. EM analysis, however, indicated that in contrast to s-Mgm1, higher-ordered structures are not observed on IMC liposomes containing inserted l-Mgm1 alone or inserted l-Mgm1 in combination with s-Mgm1 in the absence or presence of GTP or nonhydrolyzable GTP analogues (unpublished data). Thus, based on our structural analysis, we postulate that l- and s-Mgm1 self assemble together into shorter range structures, not detectable by negative stain EM analysis, that function to mediate mitochondrial membrane fusion by locally deforming the inner membrane. In this context, we think it is likely that l-Mgm1, as the integral membrane protein, functions to both tether inner membranes together and harness GTP-dependent conformational changes of s-Mgm1 that are needed to destabilize lipid bilayers for fusion.</p><p>We can also speculate on the potential roles of homotypic l- and s-Mgm1 structures in mitochondria. One obvious function for homotypic membrane-anchored l-Mgm1 dimers is in the maintenance of cristae structures that have previously been shown to require Mgm1/Opa1 function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Frezza et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Meeusen et al., 2006</xref>). Our observation that the GTPase domain of l-Mgm1 is inactive and that fusion requires a heterodimeric l-Mgm1/s-Mgm1 structure predicts that l-Mgm1 dimers that form from adjacent membranes could function as membrane tethers that would not promote membrane fusion events. Such l-Mgm1 dimers could provide stability to cristae structures and proximity to adjacent inner membranes in the process of fusion. Although s-Mgm1 dimers possess intrinsic affinity for inner membranes, a role as an inner membrane tether seems unlikely given that they do not possess a transmembrane region. However, s-Mgm1 dimers could play a role in inner membrane organization and cristae structure by forming lattices to create a more lamellar inner membrane structure.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Strains and plasmids</title><p>Strains used were W303 (ade-1; leu2-3; his3-11, 15; trp1-1, ura3-1; can1-100 MatA) and W303 <italic>&#x00394;mgm1</italic> (ade-1; leu2-3; his3-11, 15; trp1-1, ura3-1; can1-100 MatA; <italic>&#x00394;mgm1</italic>:HIS3). pRS425 <italic>dnm1<sup>G385D</sup></italic>, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Naylor et al., 2006</xref>), was subcloned into pRS316 using the XhoI and NotI sites.

Images from six tilted negatively stained 2D crystals at a 30&#x000b0; sample tilt and eight tilted crystals at a 45&#x000b0; sample tilt were processed and merged into a 3D reconstruction, and the same 31-&#x000c5; resolution cutoff was applied. The final map was created from 1,033 observed amplitudes and phases, and had an overall phase residual of 26.8&#x000b0;. The overall weighted phase residual was 9.6&#x000b0;.</p></sec><sec><title>Homology modeling of s-Mgm1</title><p>Homology modeling was performed with the program Modeller (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mart&#x000ed;-Renom et al., 2000</xref>) using the structures of dynamin A, dynamin 1, and dynamin-like bacterial protein (PDB accession nos. <ext-link ext-link-type="pdb" xlink:href="1JWY">1JWY</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="pdb" xlink:href="2AKA">2AKA</ext-link>, and <ext-link ext-link-type="pdb" xlink:href="2J69">2J69</ext-link>) as references. Sequence alignment for Mgm1, dynamin A, and dynamin 1 was performed within Modeller. Because of the low homology between Mgm1 and the dynamin-like bacterial protein, the sequence alignment for the latter was obtained from the mGenThreader server (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">McGuffin and Jones, 2003</xref>). The full alignment was checked with the mumsa program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lassmann and Sonnhammer, 2002</xref>), and 1,000 models were generated using Modeller (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mart&#x000ed;-Renom et al., 2000</xref>). The five models with the lowest DOPE score were manually inspected, and the best model that did not show knots in coil regions was selected. This model had a DOPE score of &#x02212;59,372.</p><p>The dimeric form of s-Mgm1 was obtained by 100 rounds of blind docking with the GRAMM-X server (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tovchigrechko and Vakser, 2005</xref>), followed by a local search with Rosetta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gray et al., 2003</xref>). From the 1,000 docked models, the best 10 dimeric arrangements were selected by manual verification of the presence of a twofold symmetry and a head-to-head arrangement of the monomers. The model that showed the best fit with the experimental 3D reconstruction and the lowest number of atoms outside of the volume was manually selected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 D</xref>).</p><p>Figures of the 3D reconstruction were produced with Chimera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pettersen et al., 2004</xref>) and the homology model was rendered using POV-Ray (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.povray.org">http://www.povray.org</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec><title>Negative stain EM</title><p>Reactions containing l-Mgm1, s-Mgm1, and l- + s-Mgm1 or corresponding storage buffers were prepared as described for the GTPase assays, and nucleotide was added as indicated. When the reactions were complete, a glow-discharged carbon-coated grid was placed on a 10-&#x000b5;l drop of the reaction mix for 1 min. The grid was then stained with 2% uranyl acetate for 1.5 min, blotted, and air dried. The grids were imaged at 37,000&#x000d7; using a transmission EM (CM120 [Phillips] with a biotwin lens [FEI]) operating at 80 kV, and images were captured digitally using a MegaScan CCD camera (Gatan) and the Digital Micrograph software package (Gatan).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank Dr. Marijn Ford for advice on protein purification and members of the Nunnari laboratory for discussion and comments on the manuscript.
