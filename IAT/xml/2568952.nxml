This inducible expression permits the repeated following of the time-dependent development of the events in which the same cell constitutes its own control. Using the 2BN11 model system, we previously observed that intracellular alkalinization driven by an up-regulation of the Na<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>/H<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>-exchanger (NHE1) is a very early physiological event in transformation and is essential for the development of other transformed phenotypes such as increased glycolytic metabolism, increased growth rate and both serum-independent and anchorage-independent growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003529-Reshkin2">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>.

In this sensor, the Rho Binding Domain (RBD) of the RhoA effector protein, Rhotekin, is sandwiched by Venus-YFP and CFP. The binding of endogenous GTP-RhoA to RBD generates a conformational change that displaces YFP and CFP, thereby decreasing fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) efficiency between the two fluorophores, while a reduction of intracellular active RhoA results in the opposite effect. The CFP channel images were divided by the YFP-FRET channel images. The activity of RhoA is monitored by measuring CFP (480 nm)/YFP(545) fluorescence emission values upon excitation of the transfected cells at 430 nm. To eliminate the distracting data from regions outside of cells, the YFP channel is used as a saturation channel. The ratio images are presented in pseudocolor mode.

Increased levels of cAMP produce a decrease in FRET signal, measured as YFP-to-CFP emissions ratio, due to cAMP binding to the chimeric PKA reporter and the resultant separation of the catalytic and regulatory subunits. In time course experiments, when the cAMP signal was stable, cells were first treated with IBMX in order to observe the activity level of endogenous adenylate cyclase and then were perfused with IBMX together with forskolin to determine the dynamic range of increasing activity of the remaining non E7-stimulated enzyme. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003529-g003">Figure 3B</xref>, IBMX superfusion stimulated cAMP production approximately 2-fold at 3 hrs and 4.5-fold at 24 hrs in the E7 transformed cells compared to the control cells, while the further cAMP elevation after forskolin (FSK) treatment was similar in both conditions.

Further, inhibition of p38 with either SB203580 or via transient expression of a dominant negative p38alpha mutant (dn p38alpha) blocked the H89-dependent abrogation of the transformation-dependent activation of NHE1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003529-g003">Figure 3A</xref>), further supporting the suggestion that PKA and p38alpha belong both physically and functionally to a common signalling unit, in which PKA acts up-stream to p38 in regulating the transformation-dependent stimulation of NHE1 activity.</p><p>As RhoA is known be a PKA-signalling effector in a plethora of cell responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003529-Cardone1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003529-Ellerbroek1">&#x0005b;58&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003529-Qiao1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref> and to play an important role in regulating p38 kinase activity in several cellular regulatory contexts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003529-Cardone1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003529-Dreissigacker1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003529-Mao1">&#x0005b;63&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003529-Moule1">&#x0005b;64&#x0005d;</xref>, we analysed its involvement in underlying the down-regulation of p38 by PKA and in their regulation of E7-dependent activation of NHE1. We observed that RhoA was rapidly phosphorylated at Ser-188 upon E7 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003529-g004">Figs. 4A &#x00026; B</xref>) and PKA is involved in this phosphorylation since inhibition of the kinase with H89 or its stimulation by forskolin (Fsk) during the time of induction of E7 expression respectively blocked or potentiated the E7-induced phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003529-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>). Further, RhoA was inhibited upon E7 expression with a time course parallel to its E7-induced phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003529-g006">Figures 6A &#x00026; B</xref>) and inhibition of PKA by H89 reversed the decrease in RhoA activity only in transformed cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003529-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). Interestingly, FRET measurements of Rho-GEFs/GAP activity revealed that the inhibition of RhoA via changes in their activity could be excluded during E7 transformation. Altogether these data suggest that the PKA that is activated in HPV16 E7 transformed cells inhibits RhoA activity through its phosphorylation of RhoA at serine 188. RhoA has been recently reported to be inhibited as a result of transformation driven by TGFbeta <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003529-Townsend1">&#x0005b;67&#x0005d;</xref> or, importantly, HPV16 E7 expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003529-Charette1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref> suggesting that this might be a common mechanism. An important question was if the observed PKA-dependent phosphorylation and inhibition of RhoA is necessary for the transformation-dependent up-regulation of NHE1 activity. Analysis of NHE1 activity after transfection of a dn RhoA mutant or siRNA to block RhoA function/expression or a ca RhoA mutant to enhance RhoA function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003529-g006">Figure 6C</xref>) demonstrated the importance of the inhibition of RhoA activity in E7 transformation-induced NHE1 activity while transfection of the phosphodead (pd) RhoA mutant revealed the important role for its PKA-dependent phosphorylation in E7 transformation-induced NHE1 activity.</p><p>The activity of many enzymes is strictly controlled by intracellular pH (pHi) and, therefore, an important question is what extent this E7-induced signal cascade described herein might be altered via feedback by the changes in pHi driven by the stimulated NHE1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003529-Reshkin2">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>. To address this question, we measured cAMP production, phosphorylation of RhoA and the inhibition of p38 in the presence and absence of 2 &#x000b5;M HOE642, a potent and specific inhibitor of the NHE1, in both 2BN11 cells and in early and late passages of HPK1A cells. This treatment has been previously shown to block the development of phenotypes down-stream of the NHE1 in both cell lines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003529-Reshkin2">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>. As can be seen in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003529.s003">Figure S3</xref>, this treatment had no effect on any of these process in either of the cell lines suggesting a strict unidirectionality of this signal cascade both in the rat fibroblast and human keratinocyte models.</p><p>In conclusion, in this study we have recognised a strictly defined sequential progression arising from the initial expression of E7 that rapidly transforms the cells. Our data demonstrate that an intracellular mobilization of cAMP is one of the first signaling events occurring during transformation and that this initial rise in cAMP is followed by a PKA-dependent inhibition of RhoA activity which is necessary for the inactivation of p38alpha which, in turn, regulates the subsequent E7-mediated transformation&#x02013;dependent early stimulation of NHE1 activity. An important question is whether this signal cascade is engaged by simple E7 expression or is transformation dependent. The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003529-g001">Figure 1D</xref> shows that only transformation competent E7 is able to inhibit p38 and the use of the HPK1A model system in this study, in which the original viral infection (early passage) simply immortalizes the cells and with time they become transformed (late passage), further validated the concept of transformation specific effects. Importantly, finding the same signal transduction cascade turned on in the late passage HPK1A cells also demonstrated that this signal cascade is engaged during the natural progression of primary human keratinocyte cells that were infected with the actual HPV16 virus and is not just a consequence of the expression of a single viral gene as was also observed previously for NHE1 activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003529-Reshkin2">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>. The elucidation of these signal transduction systems and, more importantly, their interrelations in the early stages of the HPV-dependent transformation processes could provide indications for novel therapeutic strategies and/or a potential marker test for the clinical determination of pre-cancer, HPV-transformed cells in the cervix.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0003529.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Effect of pharmacological treatment and transfection of cDNA plasmids on E7 message expression by RT-PCR analysis. 2BN11 cells were treated with each of the pharmacological agents or transfected with the indicated cDNA encoding vectors as described in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Results</xref>.
