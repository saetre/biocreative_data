However, the substrates of most E3 enzymes remain unknown. Here, we describe the development of a novel proteomic <italic>in vitro</italic> ubiquitination screen using a protein microarray platform that can be utilized for the discovery of substrates for E3 ligases on a global scale. Using the yeast E3 Rsp5 as a test system to identify its substrates on a yeast protein microarray that covers most of the yeast (<italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>) proteome, we identified numerous known and novel ubiquitinated substrates of this E3 ligase. Our enzymatic approach was complemented by a parallel protein microarray protein interaction study. Examination of the substrates identified in the analysis combined with phage display screening allowed exploration of binding mechanisms and substrate specificity of Rsp5. The development of a platform for global discovery of E3 substrates is invaluable for understanding the cellular pathways in which they participate, and could be utilized for the identification of drug targets.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>endocytosis</kwd><kwd>Nedd4</kwd><kwd>post-translational modification</kwd><kwd>proteomics</kwd><kwd>ubiquitin ligase</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec disp-level="1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Substrates of the ubiquitin pathway are covalently modified by the attachment of a small protein called ubiquitin and as a result are targeted for degradation or other cellular fates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">Pickart, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Glickman and Ciechanover, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Hicke and Dunn, 2003</xref>). Ubiquitination involves the sequential action of three enzymes: E1 (ubiquitin-activating enzyme), E2 (ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme) and E3 (ubiquitin-protein ligase) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">Pickart, 2001</xref>). The E3 enzyme, which is responsible for the specificity of the reaction, associates with substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Hershko and Ciechanover, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">Pickart, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Fang and Weissman, 2004</xref>), and defects in this interaction have been implicated in numerous diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Abriel <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Dawson and Dawson, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Liu, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">Nakayama and Nakayama, 2006</xref>).</p><p>A significant fraction of the proteome is regulated by the ubiquitin pathway and eukaryotic genomes express hundreds of E3 ligases to coordinate the ubiquitination of cellular proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">Peng <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62">Willems <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>). Currently, most E3 enzymes have not been linked to any specific substrate and any platform that would allow for the systematic discovery of enzymatic E3 substrates would be tremendously useful for advancing our understanding of the ubiquitin pathway. Rsp5 is a yeast E3 ubiquitin ligase that belongs to the Nedd4 family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">Rotin <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>). It contains a C2 domain, a catalytic HECT domain and three WW domains that can bind substrates directly by recognizing a (L/P)PxY sequence (PY motif) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Kanelis <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Kasanov <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Hu <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">Shcherbik <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>). Ubiquitination of proteins by the Nedd4 E3 family has been implicated in numerous cellular functions, including endocytosis, sorting and trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">Rotin <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Horak, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Ingham <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>). For example, Nedd4 (or Nedd4-2), the human Rsp5 homologue, ubiquitinates the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) to regulate its endocytosis, and mutations that inhibit the Nedd4-2:ENaC interaction cause Liddle syndrome, a hereditary hypertension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">Staub <italic>et al</italic>, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Abriel <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Lifton <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>). Similarly, Rsp5 was demonstrated to regulate endocytosis and sorting of several yeast plasma membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Horak, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Dupre <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>). Moreover, Rsp5 has been implicated in the regulation of several other cellular functions, including mitochondrial inheritance, drug resistance, intracellular pH, fatty acid biosynthesis and transcriptional control (see below).</p><p>Despite the biological importance of the Nedd4/Rsp5 family of E3 ligases, only a few substrates have been identified to date for this ubiquitin ligase family. Thus, our goal was to globally identify Rsp5 substrates in the yeast proteome. For that, we chose to use protein microarray technology as our experimental platform. The arrays used in this study contain thousands of purified proteins (most of the <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> proteome) immobilized at a high spatial density on standard sized slides and can be readily used to probe the yeast proteome using traditional biochemical approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b65">Zhu <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">Schweitzer <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66">Zhu and Snyder, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Bertone and Snyder, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">Ptacek <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">Smith <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>).</p><p>To date, few studies have assayed enzymatic activities using this technology. In the current study, we have successfully used yeast (<italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>) protein microarrays to assay the enzymatic (ubiquitination) activity and binding of Rsp5 to its substrates, and we have identified previously reported and novel ubiquitinated substrates and interacting partners of this E3 ligase.</p><p>Our results also demonstrate how this approach can yield informative data regarding the binding mechanisms and substrate specificity of an E3 enzyme.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Identification of proteins ubiquitinated by Rsp5 on a proteome array</title><p>For this study, ubiquitinated Rsp5 substrates were identified using commercially available yeast protein microarrays (Invitrogen ProtoArray<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Yeast Proteome Microarray). These protein microarrays are based on technology described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b65">Zhu <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>) and contain more than 4000 GST- and 6 &#x000d7; HIS-tagged yeast proteins from <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> spotted in duplicate on nitrocellulose slides (ProtoArray<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Yeast Proteome Microarray nc v1.1).</p><p>Before assaying for ubiquitinated proteins on the protein microarray, we developed conditions in which Rsp5 could ubiquitinate one of its known substrates, the C-terminal domain of Rpb1 (CTD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Beaudenon <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>). The ubiquitination of CTD was dependent on the budding yeast E1 enzyme, an E2 enzyme (Ubc4), ubiquitin, Rsp5 and ATP, and was visualized by Western blotting. This control reaction was used to optimize conditions for Rsp5-dependent ubiquitination on nitrocellulose-coated glass slides. In these experiments, the CTD and other proteins were robotically spotted onto slides and incubated with a reaction mixture containing Rsp5 and FITC-labeled ubiquitin. The proteome array was then assayed for Rsp5-dependent ubiquitination using the optimized conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><p>Following the reaction, protein microarray slides were washed, scanned and proteins modified by ubiquitin were identified by quantifying the intensity of the FITC signal produced compared with the background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1B</xref>). Although detection of protein&#x02013;protein interactions on microarrays is generally highly reproducible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b65">Zhu <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Hesselberth <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1A and B</xref>), we repeated the Rsp5 ubiquitination reaction on two separate protein microarray slides to increase the quality of our data set. Based on selection criteria for identifying positive hits described in Materials and methods, we generated a data set of 150 Rsp5 substrates (henceforth referred to as the &#x02018;relaxed Rsp5 substrate set'). From this set of substrates, we selected a &#x02018;high-confidence' data set, which comprises the 40 proteins that produce the strongest signal. These proteins were considered for further study (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table I</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table SI</xref>).</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Properties of the high-confidence Rsp5 substrate set</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>PY motifs</title><p>Since Rsp5-WW domains are known to bind PY motifs, we looked for the presence of these motifs in the sequences of proteins belonging to the Rsp5 substrate sets. As expected, proteins containing PY motifs were significantly enriched in the Rsp5 high-confidence substrate set (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01&#x02014;exact randomization test). In the yeast proteome, approximately 4&#x00025; of proteins contain PPxY motifs, and 7&#x00025; contain LPxY motifs. In the Rsp5 high-confidence substrate set, 72&#x00025; of proteins had at least one of these motifs. Proteins with PPxY and LPxY motifs were significantly enriched both in the high-confidence and relaxed Rsp5 substrate data sets (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01 for both&#x02014;exact randomization test).</p></sec><sec disp-level="3"><title>Identification of known substrates</title><p>Rsp5 has been implicated in a wide range of cellular pathways and a number of its substrates have previously been described. Eleven proteins in the high-confidence Rsp5 substrate set, and 17 proteins in the relaxed substrate set, have previously been identified in Rsp5 pathways through genetic and biochemical methods (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table I</xref>). The relatively large number of previously described Rsp5 substrates identified in this study suggests that the proteome microarray experimental approach is capable of discovering proteins ubiquitinated by Rsp5 <italic>in vivo</italic> and that many of the proteins in the high-confidence substrate set and the relaxed substrate set are likely novel biologically relevant substrates of Rsp5.</p></sec><sec disp-level="3"><title>Detection of substrate ubiquitination using Western blotting</title><p>We used an established ubiquitination assay to confirm that the proteins identified as Rsp5 substrates on the protein microarray are modified by this E3. Traditional approaches for monitoring ubiquitination involve subjecting specific purified proteins to ubiquitination by an E3 <italic>in vitro</italic> and using a Western blot approach to visualize ubiquitination.</p><p>Fifteen proteins from the Rsp5 high-confidence substrate set, and six proteins that were not identified as substrates of Rsp5, were purified from yeast using glutathione affinity purification, incubated in ubiquitination reactions containing Rsp5 and the above described E1 and E2 (Ubc4), and assayed for ubiquitination using anti-ubiquitin antibodies and Western blots. All of the proteins whose ubiquitination was detected on the protein microarray were verified to be ubiquitinated by Western blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table I</xref>). Most of the proteins were efficiently polyubiquitinated or ubiquitinated on multiple lysines. In contrast, the six proteins tested whose ubiquitination was not detected on the protein microarray did not appear to be ubiquitinated after Western blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2B</xref>), confirming that the enzymatic activity detected is specific and that the data generated by the protein microarray approach are consistent with established methods of detecting ubiquitination.</p><p>To further validate our <italic>in vitro</italic> data, we tested for <italic>in vivo</italic> ubiquitination of several putative substrates (known or suspected to be involved in sorting/endocytosis), by comparing ubiquitination of these proteins expressed in <italic>RSP5</italic> (WT) or <italic>rsp5-1</italic> mutant yeast cells. <italic>rsp5-1</italic> is a temperature-sensitive mutant that reduces Rsp5 expression upon temperature shift to 37&#x000b0;C (an <italic>rsp5</italic>-null mutant is lethal). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2C</xref>, Lsb1 and Sna3 (both known interactors or substrates of Rsp5; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Ho <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">McNatt <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">Oestreich <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>), as well as Sna4, were ubiquitinated <italic>in vivo</italic> by Rsp5. Although the function of Sna4 is unknown, it is a vacuolar resident protein, much like Sna3, and we thus anticipate that it too utilizes interactions with Rsp5 for vacuolar targeting. Our preliminary data also revealed <italic>in vivo</italic> ubiquitination of other substrates by Rsp5 (e.g. Yip5, Rcr1 and Rcr2&#x02014;data not shown).</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Identification of Rsp5 interacting proteins</title><p>To directly test Rsp5 substrate binding using the protein microarrays, and to compare these data to the ubiquitination data sets above, we screened the protein microarrays for proteins that bind Rsp5. Purified Rsp5 was labeled with Alexa 647 and incubated with the protein microarray in two separate experiments. After washing and scanning the slides, the data were analyzed and a data set of 155 Rsp5 binding proteins was generated (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2">Table II</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table SII</xref>).</p><p>A sequence search revealed that the Rsp5 binding set was significantly enriched for proteins containing PY motifs (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01&#x02014;exact randomization test).

Conversely, 34&#x00025; of the proteins in the Rsp5 interaction set were ubiquitinated by Rsp5. Eleven of the 12 proteins that both bound to and were ubiquitinated by Rsp5 contain PY motifs.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Pro, Ser and Ala residues are enriched at the &#x02018;x' position of (L/P)PxY motifs</title><p>We examined the amino-acid sequences of Rsp5 substrates to determine whether additional amino-acids residues in the PY motif ((L/P)PxY) may contribute to substrate specificity. A total of 38 PY motifs were present in 29 proteins of the high-confidence subset. Considering the third (x) position in the motif, the most frequent motifs were PP<underline>S</underline>Y (ten), PP<underline>A</underline>Y (five) and PP<underline>P</underline>Y (five). Comparisons with sets of randomly selected proteins containing PY motifs showed that Ser and Ala (but not Pro) were both significantly overrepresented at the third position within our experimentally determined Rsp5 substrates (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001; randomized exact test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>To further confirm these findings, we performed a modified phage display screen to explore substrate specificity of each of the three WW domains of Rsp5. All peptides identified through this screen (over 300) were found to contain a PY motif. Consistent with data presented above, Ser and Ala were both found to be preferred at the third position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4</xref>). More interestingly, the most common amino-acid residue associated with the third position was Pro, suggesting an important biological role for this residue.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this report, we demonstrate that protein microarrays can be used to identify, on a global scale, ubiquitinated substrates and binding partners of a yeast E3 ubiquitin ligase, Rsp5. A combination of techniques was used to validate the protein microarray data and contributes to our understanding of Rsp5 substrate interaction mechanisms.</p><p>The high-confidence Rsp5 substrate set contains 12 proteins previously reported in Rsp5 pathways. Six of these (Ygr068c, Aly2, Lsb1, Ylr392c, Dia1 and Rim4) were reported in other HTP screens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Ito <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Ho <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Kus <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Krogan <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>), while the remaining six (Rod1, Rog3, Rvs167, Bul1, Sna3 and Ack1) were validated as substrates using a combination of genetic and biochemical approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b64">Yashiroda <italic>et al</italic>, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Andoh <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">Stamenova <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Kus <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>).</p><p>Most of the high-confidence Rsp5 substrates contained at least one PY motif, usually PPxY (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table I</xref>). However, a few substrates did not (e.g. Sgt1, Cue5, Sip5). Sgt1, Cue1 and Sip5 are known to be involved in the ubiquitin pathway. The precise role of Sgt1 is not clear, but the association of this protein with Rsp5 is interesting, since it has been implicated as an activator of SCF E3 enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Kitagawa <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">Spiechowicz and Filipek, 2005</xref>). Cue1 has a ubiquitin binding motif and its affinity for ubiquitin may facilitate its monoubiquitination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Kang <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>). Alternatively, it is possible that it might have bound FITC-ubiquitin non-covalently; however, this is unlikely because its ubiquitination was also detected on a Western blot. Sip5 may not be an Rsp5 substrate, since it has a RING/U-box domain and likely produced a positive signal in the screen because it used the ubiquitin machinery present during the reaction for autoubiquitination.</p><p>In addition to the known Rsp5 substrates described above, the relaxed Rsp5 substrate set contains six other proteins that were previously identified as Rsp5 substrates or implicated in Rsp5 pathways. These include, Rpb7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Kus <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>), Tef2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Kwapisz <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>), Ubi4, Uba1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Huibregtse <italic>et al</italic>, 1995</xref>), Rpl40B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Kabir <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>) and Rpl40A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Kabir <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Kwapisz <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>).</p><p>The identification of 18 proteins known to participate in Rsp5 pathways or to be ubiquitinated directly by Rsp5 suggests that the protein microarray experimental approach is a valid tool for the discovery of ubiquitinated E3 substrates, and that this approach is capable of discovering physiological substrates of Rsp5.</p><p>Not all known Rsp5 substrates were identified in our screen. First, some of the known substrates were not printed on the array (e.g. Mga2, Rpb1, Hpr1, Bsd2 and Pma1). Second, our approach is likely to have missed Rsp5 substrates that do not bind Rsp5 directly or require cofactors for their interaction. This is a plausible explanation because some of the known substrates that were not identified on the array (Gap1, Fur4, Rfa1, Zrt1 and Tat2) do not have PY motifs, do not bind Rsp5 directly, and may require adaptor proteins (e.g. Bul1 and Bul2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Helliwell <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>) to bind Rsp5. Third, it is impossible to tell how the purification and printing process used to make the array may have affected the accessibility of some substrates to bind Rsp5.</p><p>In the high-confidence data set, 20 novel Rsp5 substrates were identified. Consistent with the well-established role of Rsp5 in ubiquitinating proteins at the plasma membrane or Golgi and affecting their sorting to vesicles, endosomes and to the vacuole, there are nine proteins in the high-confidence Rsp5 substrate list (Ymr171c, Rcr1, Rcr2, Sna3, Sna4, Yip5, Ydl012C and Alg6) that localize to either the plasma membrane, the vacuole, or have otherwise been implicated in the secretory pathway. Further characterization of these substrates is necessary in order to better understand their role in Rsp5-dependent cellular pathways.</p><p>Twelve proteins in the high-confidence Rsp5 substrate set, and 52 proteins in the relaxed Rsp5 substrate set, were also present in the Rsp5 interaction set. Of the 12 proteins that bound Rsp5 in the high-confidence substrate set, seven had been previously described in Rsp5 pathways, and four are novel substrates.</p><p>A recent study used the same protein microarray to find binding substrates for individual WW domains of Rsp5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Hesselberth <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). Their network of interactions identified 124 interactions, of which eight had previously been reported as Rsp5 substrates (compared with 10 known substrates in our Rsp5 interaction data set). Fourteen proteins in this Hesselberth data set overlapped with our high-confidence Rsp5 substrate set and 58 overlapped with the relaxed Rsp5 ubiquitinated substrate set. Fifty-eight proteins from the Hesselberth data set are also present in the Rsp5 interaction set.</p><p>The number of known substrates identified by probing the protein microarray for enzymatic (ubiquitination) substrates as opposed to binding partners of Rsp5 suggests that this experimental approach results in a much higher quality data set. One explanation for this is that the binding affinity for WW domains and PY motifs is relatively weak (low to mid micromolar range) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Kanelis <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">2006</xref>) and transient Rsp5 substrate interactions may therefore be missed when probing the array for interactions. If these transient interactions result in the enzymatic transfer of ubiquitin, however, it will likely be detected because ubiquitin becomes covalently, and therefore permanently bound to its substrate. Furthermore, polyubiquitination (or multi-monoubiquitination) of substrates on the proteome microarray may result in the amplification of fluorescent signal and thus a higher sensitivity may be achieved. Finally, in addition to being more sensitive, probing for ubiquitination is a more direct assay of Rsp5's biological role and therefore more likely to yield information that is more physiologically relevant.</p><p>As expected, the high-confidence substrate set was significantly enriched for proteins containing (L/P)PxY motifs. Statistical analysis of proteins identified from binding and ubiquitination protein microarrays and the protein screens from phage display experiments, reveal a preponderance of Pro, Ala and Ser residues in the third (x) position of the PY motif. These findings are in accordance with a survey of previously reported Rsp5 substrates containing PY motifs; Ala and Ser are found in the PY motifs of six proteins (Sna3, Bul1, Bul2, Rod1, Rog3 and Rvs167) and absent in two (Spt23 and Mga2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Hoppe <italic>et al</italic>, 2000</xref>). Furthermore, it was shown that the WW domains from three distinct proteins (KIAA0082, Ras GTPase-activating-like protein IQGAP1 and Transcription Factor CA150) have a binding preference to motifs with Pro and Ala at the third position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Hu <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>). Finally, an earlier phage display study, which characterized the binding preferences of WW domains from Rsp5 and other proteins, had also demonstrated that Ala and Ser residues are favored within the PY motif of the first domain, whereas Pro was found to be most abundant in the second and third domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Kasanov <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>).</p><p>The mechanism of how Rsp5 recognizes PY motifs in substrates is not well understood. By highlighting the preference for a limited number of residues within the (L/P)PxY motif, these analyses may provide additional insights into the mechanism of substrate recognition by Rsp5 and ultimately a better general understanding of WW domain&#x02013;substrate interactions.</p><p>The availability of complete genomes for an additional 17 species of related fungi (Ascomycetes) was exploited to explore the evolution of the Rsp5 substrates identified in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. Orthologous sets of proteins for each Rsp5 substrate were generated and used to determine the presence of conserved (L/P)PxY motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S1A</xref>). Conservation of the PY motif was observed in the majority of orthologues, particularly within the closely related <italic>Saccharomyces senso stricto</italic> species. Comparisons of Ka/Ks ratios for the orthologues identified across other fungal species found that the nucleotide sequence underlying the (L/P)PxY motif is under stronger purifying selection (and hence more highly conserved) than the neighboring residues (Ka/Ks &#x0003c;0.1; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S1B</xref>)), reflecting their functional importance. In addition, this was associated with the conservation of Ser, Pro and Ala at the third position (position &#x02018;x' in the (L/P)PxY motif) in all but two orthologous sets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure S1C</xref>), in agreement with the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">4</xref>. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that the sequence (L/P)P(S/P/A)Y is important to maintain the interaction between the substrate and the WW domain of the Rsp5 orthologue in each species.</p><p>To help assess the physiological relevance of the ubiquitination and <italic>in vitro</italic> binding assays, we integrated the data from this current study with recently generated physical and genetic interaction datasets, to derive an Rsp5 interaction network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">Schuldiner <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Gavin <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Krogan <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Collins <italic>et al</italic>, 2007b</xref>). Consistent with a role in ubiquitination, both positive (alleviating) and negative (aggravating) genetic interactions were observed with the deubiquitinating enzymes Ubp13 and Ubp3/Bre5, suggesting that these enzymes may share similar substrates. Further inspection of the Rsp5 map reveals that a large number of physical and genetic interactions place Rsp5 into pathways responsible for the regulation of chromatin function and transcription. Consistent with this, Rsp5 was originally isolated in a genetic screen for suppressors of mutations in Spt3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">Wang <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>), a subunit of the SAGA (Spt/Ada/Gcn5/acetyltransferase) complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Eisenmann <italic>et al</italic>, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">Roberts and Winston, 1997</xref>), which modulates the transcription activity of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII). Although it is known that Rsp5 ubiquitinates the large subunit of RNAPII (Rpb1) under conditions of UV irradiation, its exact role in transcriptional regulation is not well understood. From the interaction network it is clear that Rsp5 is physically and genetically linked to several complexes involved in chromatin remodeling and/or transcription regulation, including the histone deacetylase Rpd3C(L) complex, the histone Snf1 kinase complex, SAGA, SWI/SNF and Mediator. In addition to transcriptional regulation, Rsp5 seems to be functionally linked to several other processes including rRNA metabolism and mRNA splicing. For example, Dis3 has previously been shown to be the key regulator of the exosome (responsible for degradation of snoRNAs, mRNAs and rRNAs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Dziembowski <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). Here, we have shown that Rsp5 is both capable of binding and ubiquitinating Dis3, suggesting that one mode of its (and hence the exosomes) regulation may occur through the ubiquitin pathway. Finally, two previously uncharacterized proteins, Yjl084c and Ykr021w, were not only found to bind to and are substrates of Rsp5 but also were recently shown to be physically associated with Rsp5 <italic>in vivo</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Krogan <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Collins <italic>et al</italic>, 2007a</xref>). Interestingly, these are two out of the four budding yeast proteins that contain an arrestin N domain, which in metazoans is linked to inactivation of G protein-coupled receptors and cross-talk with other signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">Modzelewska <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). These relatively specific connections suggest this region may be mediating the binding and/or activity of Rsp5. It is expected that the interaction network presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6</xref> will facilitate the generation of many more testable hypotheses of Rsp5 function.</p><p>In summary, by applying the ubiquitination assay to the protein microarray platform, we have developed a sensitive assay that can be used to discover numerous substrates simultaneously, covering the whole proteome. Our approach should support the screening of other E3 systems both in humans and in yeast. Furthermore, once proteins on the array are ubiquitinated by a particular E3, deubiquitinating enzymes could be screened for specific substrates. In such experiments, loss of signal would indicate that a particular protein has been deubiquitinated.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Purification of yeast E2 enzymes</title><p>Yeast E2 gene <italic>UBC4</italic> was expressed in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> strain BL21 (DE3) from pET15b plasmids as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Kus <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>).

The fluorescent signal demonstrates CTD and Ydl203c ubiquitination in the presence of ATP (right panel), while negative control proteins are not ubiquitinated (left panel). Blue color represents ubiquitination (detected with FITC-Ub). GFP was used as a positive control, as it has the same excitation wavelength as FITC.
