Both contained a BA3-type minus origin of replication and an RSA-site, believed to constitute a site-specific recombination site. These two regions were more than 99% homologous to the corresponding regions of the Staphylococcus aureus plasmid pUB110. Deleting the BA3-type minus origin resulted in the accumulation of a considerable amount of single-stranded DNA, both in L. lactis subsp. lactis and B. subtilis, indicating that this minus origin was functional in both bacterial species. Like pUB110, both plasmids contained an open reading frame encoding a putative plasmid recombination enzyme (Pre protein), which was located downstream of the RSA-site. On the basis of sequence comparisons between pUB110, pMV158, pTB913, pT181, pE194, pNE131 and pT48 two distinct families of RSA-sites and Pre proteins could be distinguished.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00135-0149-a" xlink:role="7287"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00135-0151-a" xlink:role="7289"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00135-0145.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7283"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00135-0146.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7284"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00135-0147.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7285"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00135-0148.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7286"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00135-0149.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7287"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00135-0150.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7288"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00135-0151.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7289"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00135-0152.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7290"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00135-0153.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7291"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00135-0154.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7292"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00135-0155.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7293"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00135-0156.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="7294"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
