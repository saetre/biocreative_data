People with the condition are prone to developing kidney failure and high blood pressure, and are likely to have a shorter life span than healthy people. Previous work done by a group of researchers in Newcastle-on-Tyne, UK looked at the genetic underpinnings of aHUS in three families suffering from the condition. They found a region of the genome that was linked with the disease in all three families. That region was known to contain a gene for a protein called &#x0201c;factor H,&#x0201d; as well as a number of other genes for proteins that are involved in the same pathway as factor H in controlling an ancient defence system called complement. This system helps antibodies to kill invaders by marking any cell that is not protected by proteins such as factor H. Our own cells would be under constant threat without protective proteins such as factor H. Later studies found simple genetic mutations in people with aHUS, in the genes coding for factor H. However, other work suggested that in some families with aHUS, simple genetic mutations might not be the cause; instead more complicated rearrangements of the genome might occur which would then result in an abnormal factor H that incorporated part of the gene for another protective protein called factor H related protein 1.</p></sec><sec id="sb1b"><title>Why Was This Study Done?</title><p>The researchers knew that it was important to understand the exact genetic mutations linked with aHUS in different families. This was because the exact type of mutation would help them predict whether a kidney transplant is likely to be successful in treating an individual with aHUS who has developed kidney failure. In people with mutations affecting proteins produced by the kidney, a kidney transplant would be likely to work; but in people with mutations affecting factor H, which is produced by the liver, the disease would probably recur after a kidney transplant.</p></sec><sec id="sb1c"><title>What Did the Researchers Do and Find?</title><p>In this study, the researchers went back to one of the three families with aHUS they had previously studied. The researchers had shown before that in this family, the disease was linked with the genome region containing factor H, but no precise mutation in that region had been found. This time, the researchers screened the genome of the family members and looked in particular for a specific rearrangement of the genome that they suspected might be involved. They found that the genomes in this family had been shuffled in the factor H region, resulting in an abnormal version of factor H being produced.</p></sec><sec id="sb1d"><title>What Do These Findings Mean?</title><p>The mutation these researchers identified is likely to result in development of aHUS that does not get better after a kidney transplant, because the abnormal factor H would still be produced in the liver after a transplant had been done. Therefore, the researchers suggest that patients with aHUS be checked for this particular mutation before it is decided whether to go ahead with a transplant.</p></sec><sec id="sb1e"><title>Additional Information.</title><p>Please access these Web sites via the online version of this summary at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0030431">http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0030431</ext-link>.</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/asp/diseases/diseaseinfo.asp?ID=8702">US National Institutes of Health Office of Rare Diseases</ext-link> information about atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome</p></list-item><list-item><p>The <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/dispomim.cgi?id=235400">Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM)</ext-link> contains an entry on hemolytic uremic syndrome.

In 1998 we established linkage in three families with atypical haemolytic uraemic syndrome (aHUS) to a 26 cM region at chromosome location 1q32 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030431-b001">1</xref>&#x0005d;. This area contains a group of genes that play a pivotal role in the regulation of complement activation (the regulators of complement activation &#x0005b;RCA&#x0005d; cluster). In one of these families we found a mutation in the gene encoding the soluble regulator complement factor H &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030431-b001">1</xref>&#x0005d; and subsequently in another we found a mutation in the gene encoding membrane cofactor protein, a transmembrane regulator &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030431-b002">2</xref>&#x0005d;. In the third family extensive screening of genes within the RCA cluster failed to reveal an abnormality.</p><p>Complement genes within the RCA cluster are arranged in tandem within two groups &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030431-b003">3</xref>&#x0005d;. In a centromeric 360 kb segment lie the genes encoding factor H <italic>(CFH)</italic> and five factor H-related proteins&#x02014;<italic>CFHL1</italic>&#x02013;<italic>5</italic> (aliases <italic>CFHR1&#x02013;5</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0030431-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). Sequence analysis of this region shows evidence of several large genomic duplications, also known as low copy repeats (LCRs), resulting in a high degree of sequence identity between <italic>CFH</italic> and the genes for the five factor H-related proteins &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030431-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030431-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d;. The secreted protein products of these genes are similar in that they consist of repetitive units (~60 amino acids) named short consensus repeats (SCRs) or complement control protein modules. Each SCR is generally encoded by a single exon. CFH consists of 20 SCRs and CFHL1 consists of five. The highest degree of sequence identity is seen between SCRs 18 and 20 of CFH and SCRs 3 and 5 of CFHL1. CFH SCR 18 and CFHL1 SCR 3 consist of 59 amino acids. At the nucleotide level the exons encoding these two SCRs differ by five bases. Three result in an amino acid difference. CFH has tyrosine, valine, and glutamine residues at positions 1,058, 1,060, and 1,076, respectively (encoded by triplets <bold>T</bold>AT, <bold>G</bold>TG, and <bold>C</bold>AA), whilst CFHL1 has histidine, leucine, and glutamic acid residues at positions 157, 159, and 175 (encoded by triplets <bold>C</bold>AT, <bold>C</bold>TG and <bold>G</bold>AA). CFH SCR 19 and CFHL1 SCR 4 consist of 61 amino acids. The exons encoding these two SCRs differ at one nucleotide position, which does not result in a coding change. CFH SCR20 and CFHL1 SCR 5 consist of 67 amino acids. The exons differ at two nucleotide positions, both of which affect the amino acid sequence of the encoded proteins; CFH has serine and valine residues at positions 1,191 and 1,197 (encoded by triplets T<bold>C</bold>G and G<bold>T</bold>T) while CFHL1 has leucine and alanine residues at positions 290 and 296 (encoded by triplets T<bold>T</bold>G and G<bold>C</bold>T). Mutations reported in association with aHUS include c.3572C&#x0003e;T, which results in the change S1191L and c.3590T&#x0003e;C, which results in V1197A, either singly or in combination &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030431-b006">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030431-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;. This raised the possibility that gene conversion of CFH SCR 20 by SCR 5 of CFHL1 is the mutational mechanism in a proportion of cases. c.3226C&#x0003e;G, Q1076E has also been reported &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030431-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030431-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;, raising the possibility of gene conversion of CFH SCR 18 by SCR 3 of CFHL1.</p><p>We recently reported two aHUS cases in which S1191L and V1197A changes occurred in combination as de novo events &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030431-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;, thus providing unambiguous evidence that gene conversion is the mutational mechanism involved. LCRs such as those seen in the RCA cluster not only predispose to gene conversion events but are also associated with genomic rearrangements &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030431-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;. These rearrangements usually result from nonallelic homologous recombination between LCRs. If nonallelic recombination should occur between the duplicated segments B and B&#x02032; shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0030431-g001">Figure 1</xref>B, a variety of products are possible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0030431-g001">Figure 1</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0030431-g001">1</xref>D). If recombination occurred after the terminal exons of <italic>CFH</italic> and <italic>CFHL1</italic> deletion of <italic>CFHL1</italic> and <italic>CFHL3</italic> would result. If recombination occurred within the region containing the three terminal exons (and their flanking introns) of <italic>CFH</italic> and <italic>CFHL1,</italic> then not only would <italic>CFHL3</italic> be deleted, but a hybrid <italic>CFH/CFHL1</italic> gene would be formed. If, for example, the recombination occurred at &#x0201c;X&#x0201d; in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0030431-g001">Figure 1</xref>B, a hybrid gene would result that consisted of the first 21 exons of <italic>CFH</italic> (encoding SCRs 1&#x02013;18 of the hybrid gene) and the last two exons of <italic>CFHL1</italic> (encoding SCRs 19 and 20 of the hybrid gene) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0030431-g001">Figure 1</xref>C). The hybrid gene would encode a protein product identical to the aforementioned S1191L/V1197A mutant, a change that we have shown to be functionally significant &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030431-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;. If the recombination occurred at Y, <italic>CFHL3</italic> and <italic>CFHL1</italic> would be deleted, but <italic>CFH</italic> would remain intact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0030431-g001">Figure 1</xref>C). The recombination event would also potentially lead to duplication of <italic>CFHL1</italic> and <italic>CFHL3</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0030431-g001">Figure 1</xref>D). There is already evidence that nonallelic recombination leading to deletion of <italic>CFHL1</italic> occurs as a common polymorphism in the general population &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030431-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;, and we here show that this phenomenon also leads to the formation of a hybrid <italic>CFH/CFHL1</italic> gene associated with aHUS. In particular, we have shown the presence of such a hybrid gene in the affected members of the remaining unsolved family from our original linkage study &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030431-b001">1</xref>&#x0005d;.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Clinical Details and Informed Consent</title><p>The family that is the subject of our study was first reported in 1975 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030431-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d; and more recently in 1998 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030431-b001">1</xref>&#x0005d;.

Both kidneys were lost to &#x0201c;acute rejection,&#x0201d; the first after 18 mo and the second after 8 mo. In retrospect the clinical and histopathological features were compatible with recurrent HUS. He died of a myocardial infarct at the age of 55 y.</p><p>II:2, the twin brother of II:1, presented at the age of 46 y with acute renal failure and hypertension. Investigations were compatible with a diagnosis of HUS. As with his brother, bilateral nephrectomy was necessary to control ongoing haemolysis and hypertension. He subsequently received two transplants, one at the age of 47 y and the other at 60 y. Both kidneys were lost within weeks of transplantation due to recurrent HUS. II:7 and II:10 both died of acute renal failure. II:8 died at the age of 82 y without any evidence of renal disease.</p><p>III:3 is currently aged 53 y and is well. Complement profiles have shown a persistently borderline low C3. III:4 presented at the age of 19 y with a grand mal convulsion. She had started an oral contraceptive 6 wk previously. Investigations were consistent with HUS. A complement profile was said to be normal. She died 8 wk after presentation following cardiac arrest. III:5 presented with HUS at the age of 5 y and died 6 d after presentation. III:6 presented at the age of 28 y with a short history of headaches and lethargy. Investigations were compatible with a diagnosis of HUS. He has remained on haemodialysis since then and is currently well. III:8 presented at the age of 7 y with fluid retention, hypertension, and acute renal failure. He died 9 d after admission.</p><p>IV:1 presented at the age of 7 y with HUS following a viral illness. Despite treatment with peritoneal dialysis, plasma exchange, and prostacyclin, he did not recover renal function. He received a cadaver renal transplant at age 16 y, which, despite daily plasma exchange, was lost to recurrent HUS within the first two postoperative weeks.

The protein product of the hybrid gene is identical to the factor H mutant c.3572C&#x0003e;T, S1191L/c.3590T&#x0003e;C, V1197A which we have shown arises by gene conversion in aHUS &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030431-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;. We have previously shown that this mutant is functionally significant, in that binding to C3b is impaired. The hypothesis for the existence of a hybrid <italic>CFH/CFHL1</italic> gene in the family described in this manuscript was based on two observations. First, we knew from our original linkage study &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030431-b001">1</xref>&#x0005d; that the affected individuals in this family mapped to the RCA cluster at position 1q32. Moreover, in this family there was a strong history of disease recurrence following kidney transplantation, suggesting that a soluble circulating complement regulator was responsible. Second, our recent observation that LCRs in the RCA cluster predisposed to gene conversion events suggested that LCR nonhomologous recombination might also be occurring. In support of this was the observation that the presence of factor H-related protein 1 (encoded by <italic>CFHL1</italic>) in the serum of normal controls is polymorphic, with 4.4&#x00025; of healthy blood donors having complete deficiency &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030431-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;. We hypothesised that the crossover responsible for deletion of <italic>CFHL1</italic> could also potentially result in formation of a <italic>CFH/CFHL1</italic> hybrid gene. The evidence presented here strongly supports this hypothesis. Moreover, we have evidence from three other unrelated aHUS patients that the phenomenon is not unique to this family. Renal transplantation in patients with a <italic>CFH</italic> mutation is associated with an 80&#x00025; risk of the graft being lost to recurrent disease within two years of transplantation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030431-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;. It is currently recommended that all patients undergo <italic>CFH</italic> genotyping prior to transplantation. However, the hybrid <italic>CFH/CFHL1</italic> gene described here would not be picked up by genomic sequencing using <italic>CFH</italic>-specific primers. We would, therefore, now recommend that all patients be screened also with <italic>CFH</italic> MLPA.</p><p>Could the results of this study have implications for other complement-related diseases? It has been established in several independent cohorts that <italic>CFH</italic> alleles act as a susceptibility factor for age-related macular degeneration &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030431-b017">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030431-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d; and type II membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030431-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;.
