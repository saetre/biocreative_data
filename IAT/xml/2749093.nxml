Although progress has been made in understanding the biochemical role of some human RECQ helicases, that of RECQL5 remains elusive. We recently reported that RECQL5 interacts with RNA polymerase II (RNAPII), pointing to a role for the protein in transcription. Here, we show that RECQL5 inhibits both initiation and elongation in transcription assays reconstituted with highly purified general transcription factors and RNAPII. Such inhibition is not observed with the related, much more active RECQL1 helicase or with a version of RECQL5 that has normal helicase activity but is impaired in its ability to interact with RNAPII. Indeed, RECQL5 helicase activity is not required for inhibition.

Generally, RECQ helicases appear to be involved in maintaining functional replication forks, for example by suppressing undesired recombination events during DNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Mutations in genes encoding three of the five members of the human RECQ family have been linked with severe genetic disorders, namely Bloom syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>), Werner syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>), and Rothmund-Thomson syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). These diseases are characterized by a predisposition to various types of cancers, suggesting a genome caretaker role for the human RECQ helicases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>).</p><p>RECQL5 is a relatively uncharacterized member of the RECQ family and has so far not been linked with a distinct genetic disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). However, <italic>RECQ5</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice exhibit an elevated level of sister chromatid exchange and are also predisposed to various types of cancer, strongly suggesting that the RECQ5 protein plays a role in the maintenance of genomic stability as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Recent studies indicate a role for the protein in DNA replication and cell survival after camptothecin treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). RECQL5 is expressed in all human tissues examined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>), and, in contrast to BLM and WRN helicases, its protein level does not change during the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>), suggesting that it might also have a more general, cell cycle-phase independent function.</p><p>We recently identified human RECQL5 helicase as a novel RNA polymerase II (RNAPII)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN2"><sup>2</sup></xref>-associated protein in chromatin. RECQL5 interacts directly with the polymerase and is the only member of the human RECQ family to do so (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). A number of RNAPII binding proteins or complexes, such as TFIIF, TFIIS, elongin, ELL, and the mediator complex, can serve as positive regulators of transcription initiation and/or elongation. Thus, we considered the possibility that RECQL5 might have a previously overlooked role in RNAPII transcription.</p><p>Using RNAPII transcription assays reconstituted with highly purified factors, we now show that RECQL5 helicase is an inhibitor of transcription. We discuss the possible implications of our findings for the function of RECQL5 helicase in the maintenance of genomic stability.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><sec><title/><sec><title/><sec><title>Plasmids</title><p>Generation of the pCMV-FLAG plasmid was described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>).

We previously reported that the RECQL5-RNAPII interaction requires the C-terminal half of RECQL5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). To more precisely map domains that contribute to this interaction, we established stable human 293T cell lines expressing similar amounts of different FLAG-tagged forms of RECQL5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>, <italic>A&#x02013;C</italic>). The RECQL5 protein was immunoprecipitated from the individual cell lines using anti-FLAG antibody, and the association with RNAPII was analyzed by anti-RPB1 Western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>, <italic>B</italic> and <italic>C</italic>, RPB1). As reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>), full-length RECQL5 protein bound RNAPII (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>B</italic>, <italic>lane 2</italic>), whereas the RECQL5 (1&#x02013;542) truncation mutant did not (<italic>lane 3</italic>). The remaining C-terminal part of the protein (541&#x02013;991) was unable to bind RNAPII as well (<italic>lane 4</italic>), which could suggest that residues around amino acids 542 are critical for the interaction. Indeed, we discovered that an internal deletion of nine amino acids, located between positions 542 and 552 (RECQL5<sub>ID</sub>), dramatically decreased the interaction with RNAPII (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>C</italic>, compare <italic>lanes 1</italic> and <italic>2</italic>).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>FIGURE 1.</label><caption><p><bold>A central 9-amino acid sequence is essential for RNAPII-RECQL5 interaction <italic>in vivo</italic>.</bold><italic>A</italic>, diagram describing the constructs used. <italic>B</italic> and <italic>C</italic>, Western blots of FLAG-tagged immunoprecipitations (<italic>IP</italic>) showing interactions between different forms of FLAG-tagged RECQL5 and RNAPII, using FLAG and RPB1 antibody, respectively.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="zbc0390987110001"/></fig><p>Next, we expressed wild type RECQL5, the RNAPII interaction-deficient protein (RECQL5<sub>ID</sub>), a RECQL5 helicase-deficient point mutant (RECQL5<sub>D157A</sub>), and another human RECQ family helicase, RECQL1, in <named-content content-type="genus-species">E. coli</named-content>, and purified the recombinant proteins to virtual homogeneity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>A</italic>).

RNAPII transcription starts with the assembly of a preinitiation complex at the promoter, followed by formation of the first phosphodiester bond (initiation), promoter escape, and transcript elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). To test whether RECQL5 is able to inhibit early steps of the transcription cycle, we restricted transcription to a single round by using a sarkosyl challenge approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref>). 0.015% sarkosyl specifically inhibits the preinitiation/initiation stage of RNAPII transcription without significantly affecting the processivity of an already formed elongation complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). If, for example, RECQL5 inhibits transcription by interfering with assembly of the preinitiation complex, it would be expected to affect transcription only when added together with the GTFs. RECQL5 (or RECQL5<sub>ID</sub>) was therefore added to the reconstituted RNAPII transcription reactions either before, or just after, preinitiation complex assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref><italic>A</italic>). As expected, sarkosyl prevented transcription when included at the beginning of the reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref><italic>B</italic>, <italic>lane 1</italic>). In contrast, because sarkosyl at this concentration has little or no effect on transcript elongation, addition immediately after the nucleotides merely restricted transcription to a single round (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref><italic>B</italic>, <italic>lane 2</italic>). Addition of RECQL5 to such single-round transcription reactions significantly inhibited transcription whether it was added at 0 or 25 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref><italic>B</italic>, <italic>lanes 3</italic> and <italic>4</italic>), indicating that the protein does not need to be present during preinitiation complex assembly to exert its inhibitory effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref><italic>B</italic>, <italic>lanes 3</italic> and <italic>4</italic>). In contrast, RECQL5<sub>ID</sub> protein did not inhibit transcription to the same extent, further indicating that the observed inhibitory effect was specific (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref><italic>B</italic>, <italic>lanes 5</italic> and <italic>6</italic>).</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>FIGURE 4.</label><caption><p><bold>RECQL5 inhibits an early step of RNAPII transcription.</bold><italic>A</italic>, An outline of the experiment is shown.

This abortive transcription initiation assay has been used extensively to investigate the effect of different factors on the formation of the first phosphodiester bond (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>).

We therefore prepared RNAPII elongation complexes using an oligo(dC)-tailed DNA template containing a 5&#x02032; &#x02018;U-less cassette&#x02019;, which can be transcribed by RNAPII (without the GTFs) to produce a 135-nt transcript in the absence of UTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Subsequently, upon addition of all nucleotides (including UTP), the stalled elongation complexes continue elongation to produce transcripts of increasing length with time, making it possible to test the effect of RECQL5 specifically on the process of transcript elongation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref><italic>A</italic>). Addition of RECQL5 protein significantly inhibited elongation, so that instead of long transcripts, a more general background smear was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Fig. 6</xref><italic>B</italic>, compare <italic>lanes 2&#x02013;4</italic> and <italic>5&#x02013;7</italic>).

Moreover, by dissecting the different stages of RNAPII transcription, we show that RECQL5 inhibits transcript elongation and formation of the first phosphodiester bond independently of each other. Inhibition requires a stable interaction of RECQL5 with RNAPII, but not the ATPase/helicase activity of RECQL5.</p><sec><title/><sec><title/><sec><title>RECQL5 Helicase as a Novel Inhibitor of RNAPII Transcription</title><p>The discovery of RECQL5 as a novel inhibitor of RNAPII transcription adds a potential tumor suppressor and regulator of genome integrity to the list of proteins that generally affect RNAPII transcription. It is important to point out that not all large proteins that interact with RNAPII are inhibitory. Indeed, the majority of RNAPII binding proteins that have been described either have no effect or stimulate transcription in assays such as those used in our studies. For example, RNAPII binding proteins such as elongin, ELL/EAF, TFIIF, and, under certain assay conditions, DSIF, have previously been found to stimulate transcript elongation in the systems used here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>), and the very large, multisubunit Mediator complex stimulates basal and activator-dependent transcription in related systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). Other large RNAPII-binding factors, such as Elongator, Integrator, and the polymerase-associated factor (PAF) complex have little or no effect on transcription reconstituted on naked DNA templates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>).</p><p>RECQL5 thus joins a short list of factors that includes TTF2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>), DSIF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>), and NELF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>), which can negatively regulate transcription by directly affecting RNAPII. The exact mechanism by which DSIF and NELF inhibit transcription is still not completely understood, whereas TTF2 uses its ATP-dependent activity to disrupt RNAPII transcription elongation complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). Interestingly, in contrast to TTF2, the ATPase activity of RECQL5 does not seem to be required for the inhibition of transcription reported here, although it may have a slight effect under certain conditions. RECQL5 helicase activity may be required for aspects of transcriptional inhibition not uncovered in our assays or for coupling transcription to other cellular processes such as recombination or replication or possibly only for its function in these latter processes (see below). Because the ATPase activity of RECQL5 is not essential for inhibition, RECQL5 may exert its effect primarily by binding to RNAPII and changing its conformation to a state that is less favorable for transcription. During initiation, such interaction might affect the stability of interactions with one or more GTFs or somehow change the configuration or activity of RNAPII itself to a state that is less favorable for phosphodiester bond formation. The fact that RECQL5 also inhibits RNAPII transcript elongation in the absence of additional factors seems to favor the second possibility. Future studies will focus on understanding the structural aspects of RECQL5-RNAPII association, which may help elucidate the precise mechanism by which RECQL5 inhibits transcription.</p></sec><sec><title>Transcription Inhibition by RECQL5 and Genome Stability</title><p>RECQL5 was previously proposed to suppress tumor formation by preventing undesired recombination events <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>), and recent evidence points to a role in replication-associated events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Although RECQL5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>), and presumably other helicases like it, is capable of dissociating RAD51 filaments <italic>in vitro</italic>, the exact mechanism and cellular pathway that RECQL5 utilizes to suppress recombination remains unclear. Our recent discovery of RECQL5 as a novel RNAPII-associated factor in human chromatin suggested a potential role for RECQL5 in transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). In the same experiments, RECQL5 was also found to associate with RAD51 and PCNA, confirming interactions that were previously reported by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). The inhibitory role of RECQL5 in transcription reported here may be linked to its role in the suppression of undesired recombination events, or the protein may have separate functions in transcription and DNA recombination.</p><p>Interestingly, work primarily in budding yeast has suggested that transcription is associated with replication- dependent DNA hyper-recombination, primarily in the context of head-on-collision between the transcription and DNA replication machineries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). In apparent agreement with this idea, a reduction in RNA polymerase II initiation rate suppresses hyper-recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). Transcription-associated, replication-dependent, DNA recombination also occurs in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). The precise molecular mechanisms underlying such transcription-associated recombination is not yet clear, but given the results reported here, it is an intriguing possibility that RECQL5 is involved in inhibiting transcription (initiation and/or elongation) to somehow allow safe replication of transcribed regions of the genome. Alternatively, or additionally, RECQL5 might be involved in the regulation of a transcriptional program that is important for cell cycle progression and/or genome stability. In this model, RECQL5 represses genes encoding factors that increase genome instability if inappropriately expressed. As mentioned above, RECQL5 might also conceivably play distinct roles in the cell: one in the context of transcription and a separate one in maintaining genome stability by affecting DNA recombination. The finding that the ATPase/helicase activity of RECQL5 is not required for its inhibitory role in transcription could be construed as support for this hypothesis. In any case, the RECQL5<sub>ID</sub> mutant, lacking amino acids whose presence is important for normal RECQL5-RNAPII interaction but not the helicase activity of the protein, will be useful for testing whether the ability of RECQL5 to associate with RNAPII is required for its ability to suppress crossover events during DNA recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>) and for its involvement in replication during genotoxic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, the observations reported here establish a direct inhibitory role for RECQL5 in RNAPII transcription. Further studies will be needed to elucidate the mechanistic details of inhibition as well as its physiological consequence.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="FN1" fn-type="supported-by"><label>*</label><p>This work was supported, in whole or in part, by NIGMS, National Institutes of Health Grant R37 41628 (to R.
