Previous work had indicated that the VP13 protein, a component of the virion membrane, was encoded by the I5L gene, but no additional studies had been reported. Using a recombinant virus that encodes an I5 protein fused to a V5 epitope tag at the endogenous locus (vI5V5), we show here that the I5 protein is expressed as a post-replicative gene and that the ~9 kDa protein does not appear to be phosphorylated <italic>in vivo</italic>. I5 does not appear to traffic to any cellular organelle, but ultrastructural and biochemical analyses indicate that I5 is associated with the membranous components of assembling and mature virions. Intact virions can be labeled with anti-V5 antibody as assessed by immunoelectron microscopy, indicating that the C' terminus of the protein is exposed on the virion surface. Using a recombinant virus which encodes only a TET-regulated copy of the I5V5 gene (v&#x00394;<italic>ind</italic>I5V5), or one in which the I5 locus has been deleted (v&#x00394;I5), we also show that I5 is dispensable for replication in tissue culture. Neither plaque size nor the viral yield produced in BSC40 cells or primary human fibroblasts are affected by the absence of I5 expression.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Vaccinia virus, the prototypic poxvirus, replicates solely in the cytoplasm of infected cells. This physical autonomy is accompanied by genetic autonomy: the 192 kb DNA genome, encodes ~200 proteins involved in diverse aspects of the viral life cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. A virally encoded transcriptional apparatus directs three temporally regulated phases of gene expression, and a virally encoded replication apparatus mediates genome replication and maturation. A large number of proteins contribute to the complex process of morphogenesis, which culminates in the production of mature virions (MV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Most MV remain within the cell, but a subset becomes enwrapped in two extra membranes derived from the Golgi apparatus or late endosomal compartment; these wrapped virions are then released by exocytosis as enveloped virions (EV) and mediate cell-to-cell and distal spread [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Finally, a significant number of the viral genes encode proteins that interface with the host. Some of these proteins regulate intrinsic cellular responses to infection such as apoptosis and the antiviral response, whereas others represent extracellular mediators that interface with cytokines and cells of the immune system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>Comparison of the genomes of a large number of orthopoxviruses has led to the identification of ~90 genes that are fully conserved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. These genes are therefore thought to encode the repertoire of proteins required for the poxviral life cycle. A combination of genetic, cell biological and biochemical approaches have enabled the functional characterization of most, but not all, of these genes. One of the gene products that had not been studied in depth was the product of the I5L gene, which encodes a structural protein first identified as VP13 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. I5 is one of ~75 structural proteins identified by proteomic analyses as localizing to either the membrane or core of the mature poxvirus virion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Core proteins include structural proteins essential for the assembly of the virion core, the full complement of proteins required for mediating the early phase of gene expression, and virally encoded kinases and phosphatases. The MV membrane contains ~20 proteins, many of which contribute to virion morphogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. At least 11 membrane proteins are essential for virion entry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], and others mediate the association of virions with GAGs or laminins on the cell surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Other membrane proteins appear to be dispensable in vitro but contribute to pathogenesis in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Because our laboratory has a long-standing interest in virion morphogenesis and in the function of virion membrane proteins, we undertook an analysis of the I5 protein.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Materials, cells and viruses</title><p>African green monkey kidney BSC40 cells and human TK<sup>- </sup>143B cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) containing 5% fetal calf serum (FCS, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) at 37&#x000b0;C in the presence of 5% CO<sub>2</sub>; human diploid fibroblasts (kindly supplied by S.

(C) The key genomic features of three recombinant viruses used in this study are shown. In the vI5V5 virus, the endogenous locus has been modified such that the I5 protein is fused to a C-terminal V5 epitope tag. In the inducible v&#x00394;<italic>ind</italic>I5V5 recombinant, the endogenous I5 ORF has been replaced by a NEO cassette, and the tetR gene and an inducible copy of the I5V5 ORF has been inserted into the non-essential thymidine kinase (TK) locus of the genome. The inducible I5V5 ORF is under the regulation of the I5 promoter and the TET operator. The v&#x00394;I5 virus was generated by replacing the I5V5 locus of vI5V5 with the NEO cassette; this virus is deleted for the I5 locus. The primers and strategy used for the generation of these viruses are shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1743-422X-5-148-1"/></fig><p>First, we generated the vI5V5 virus, in which a V5 epitope tag has been inserted at the C-terminus of the endogenous I5 open reading frame (see Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). Immunoblot analysis permitted the ready visualization of the I5 protein in cells that had been infected with vI5V5, but not wild-type (WT) virus, for 8 h (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). However, inclusion of ara C (cytosine arabinoside), which is an inhibitor of DNA replication and thus of intermediate and late gene expression, blocked the expression of I5. Hence, I5 is expressed as a post-replicative gene. The G7 protein, which is a known late protein, served as an internal control for the immunoblot analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].

In contrast, both <sup>35</sup>S-labeled and <sup>32</sup>P-labeled F18, a known phosphoprotein that is expressed at post-replicative times and encapsidated in the virion core, were retrieved in immunoprecipitations performed with the anti-F18 serum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].

DAPI was included to visualize nuclei and viral replication factories. As shown in Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>, the I5V5 protein showed a punctate distribution that overlapped the viral replication factories and extended throughout the cytoplasm. Limited background staining was seen in cells infected with wild-type virus. The punctate staining was consistent with localization of I5 to intracellular membranes, although I5 was not restricted to any sub-cellular compartment such as the ER, the Golgi, or the plasma membrane.</p><p>Since the I5L gene encodes the protein identified as the VP13 component of purified virions, we utilized immunoelectron microscopy to determine whether I5 was associated with the classical intermediates in virion morphogenesis (crescents and immature virions) as well as with mature virions.

Virions were treated with NP40 or NP40+ DTT and then sedimented to prepare soluble (S) and pellet (P) fractions that contained membrane and core proteins, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. The I5 protein was released into the soluble phase after treatment with NP40 alone (or NP40+DTT) (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). We have previously observed that two other small membrane proteins, I2 and A13, behave similarly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. In contrast, the A17 protein, which is predicted to have two membrane spanning domains, contains intramolecular and intermolecular disulfide bonds, and binds to the dimeric A14 protein, is only released into the soluble phase upon treatment with both NP40 and DTT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. The F18 core protein remains in the pellet fraction after both treatments. Thus, the I5 protein is indeed a component of the virion membrane, consistent with the report that the I5L gene encodes the VP13 membrane protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. To gain some indication of the orientation of I5 within the membrane, we labeled intact virions with the anti-V5 serum and a 10 nm-gold particle-conjugated secondary antibody. Virions produced after infection with a virus encoding a wild-type I5 allele lacking the epitope tag served as a control. The vI5V5 virions were readily labeled with the anti-V5 serum (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>), indicating that the C-terminal epitope tag is accessible on the exterior face of virions. Detection of the A17 protein on the surface of intact virions served as a positive control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Analysis of the I5 protein found within mature virions</bold>. <italic>(A) I5 is encapsidated within mature virions</italic>.

I5V5 virions (6 &#x003bc;g) were subjected to treatment with chymotrypsin (Chymo) or trypsin (Tryp) for 30 min or with proteinase K (ProtK) for 10 or 30 min. After sedimentation at 14,000 &#x000d7; g, 5 min, the soluble (S) and pellet (P) fractions were resolved and analyzed by immunoblot analysis using anti-D8 (top panel) or anti-V5 (lower panel) antibodies. The molecular masses (in kDa) of protein standards are shown at the right.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1743-422X-5-148-3"/></fig><p>Since the epitope was exposed, we tested the same anti-V5 antibody at dilutions ranging from 1:4 to 1:64 for its ability to neutralize the infectivity of vI5V5 virions (incubation at 45&#x000b0;C for 90&#x02013;360 min); wild-type virions served as a negative control. No neutralization was observed (not shown). Finally, we treated purified vI5V5 virions with chymotrypsin, trypsin or proteinase K and then examined both the virion particles (P) and the supernatant fluid (S) by immunoblot analysis with anti-V5 and anti-D8 sera. The D8 protein was readily cleaved by all three proteases, as has been observed before [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. No cleavage or loss of the anti-V5 immunoreactive signal was observed after treatment of the virions with trypsin or chymotrypsin. After proteinase K treatment, however, we noted a moderate loss of the I5V5 protein: only ~35% of the immunoreactive signal remained after 30 min of digestion. We interpret these data as evidence that proteinase K can trim the V5-tagged C-terminus of the protein, albeit inefficiently. Because we did not observe any significant change in electrophoretic mobility of the V5-tagged protein, it appears that neither the N-terminus nor the central loop region of the I5V5 protein is readily accessible to protease in intact virions.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis of an inducible recombinant in which expression of I5V5 is TET-dependent: repression of I5 does not compromise viral replication in BSC40 cells or human diploid fibroblasts</title><p>To enable a functional characterization of the role of the I5 protein in viral replication, we generated the viral recombinant v&#x00394;<italic>ind</italic>I5V5 (see Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). To generate this recombinant, we first inserted a bidirectional cassette encoding TetR (a transcriptional repressor) and an inducible copy of the I5V5 gene into the non-essential TK locus of wild-type vaccinia virus, as we have done before for the F10, A13 and I2 genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. The inducible I5V5 gene is regulated by the endogenous I5 promoter and TetO (the Tet operator). The endogenous I5 locus was then replaced with a NEO cassette that conferred resistance to G418. Our characterization of this virus is shown in Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>. Immunoblot analysis showed that, in two isolates of v&#x00394;<italic>ind</italic>I5V5, expression of the I5V5 protein was indeed TET-dependent (panel A, compare lanes 1, 3 with 2, 4). As expected, however, the I3 single-strand DNA binding protein (expressed early, intermediate) and the L4 core protein (expressed late) were expressed under all experimental conditions. Moreover, the relative abundance of both the precursor and processed forms of L4 (upper and lower bands, respectively) was unchanged when I5 was repressed. Since proteolytic processing of the core proteins is coupled to virion morphogenesis, this observation also suggested that repression of I5 might not have any impact on the completion of the viral life cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Indeed, when we monitored the yield of infectious virus produced at 24 hpi in BSC40 cells (MOI 3), we found that repression of I5 had no impact (panel B, left graph). To assess whether this result would also hold true in primary cells that more closely mimicked replication <italic>in vivo</italic>, we performed the same experiment in primary human foreskin fibroblasts. In this case, too, repression of I5 had no impact on the yield of infectious, cell-associated virus (panel B, right graph).</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Repression or deletion of the I5 locus does not have a deleterious effect on virus replication in tissue culture</bold>. <italic>(A) The v&#x00394;indI5V5 virus allows tight repression of the I5 protein</italic>.

To make this virus, we began with the vI5V5 virus, and replaced the I5V5 allele with the NEO cassette. This virus was readily isolated, suggesting that the I5L gene was indeed nonessential in tissue culture. To ensure that the genomic structure of the virus was as designed, we performed a number of diagnostic PCR assays to ensure that no I5 allele was present anywhere in the genome and that the NEO cassette had been inserted between the I4L and I6L genes. The results of all of these tests confirmed the correct insertion of the NEO cassette (not shown).

Finally, we compared the thermolability of vI5V5 and v&#x00394;I5 virions by incubating inocula at 45&#x000b0;C for 90 to 360 min and then performing plaque assays; the absence of I5 had no impact on virus stability in this assay (not shown). Cumulatively, our data indicate that I5 is dispensable for replication in both BSC40 cells and human diploid fibroblasts.</p><p>Although the I5 protein is dispensable in tissue culture, its conservation in the genomes of diverse orthopoxviruses suggests that it is likely to have an important role <italic>in vivo</italic>. Indeed, during the preparation of this manuscript, Sood et al reported that I5 does make a significant contribution to the pathogenesis of vaccinia virus in murine models of infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Because the protein does not show any preferred localization to an intracellular organelle, but is present in developing and mature virions, we propose that it is the encapsidated pool of I5 that would modulate pathogenesis. The protein is highly hydrophobic in nature, and we know that both termini of the protein are likely to be exposed on the virion surface. I5 might play a role in enabling vaccinia virus to infect certain cell types <italic>in vivo</italic>, it might stabilize the virus <italic>in vivo</italic>, or it might bind to cellular ligands in a manner that facilitates infection. Further study of how this small and highly conserved constituent of the virion membrane contributes to pathogenesis will certainly be of interest.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The 78 aa vaccinia-encoded I5 protein is highly hydrophobic and expressed at late times after infection. I5 is found associated with intermediates in virion morphogenesis as well as mature virions. The C' terminus of I5 is exposed on the surface of intact virions. Repression of I5 expression has no apparent impact on the yield of infectious virus in either BSC40 cells or human diploid fibroblasts; the ability to isolate a virus deleted for the I5L gene supports the conclusion that it is dispensable for replication in tissue culture.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>PT performed the immunoEM studies, contributed to the generation of recombinant viruses, and was responsible for the final version of the manuscript.
