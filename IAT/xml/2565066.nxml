However, transcriptional regulatory mechanisms of MAG remain to be elucidated. Here, we analyzed the promoter of the <italic>MAG</italic> gene by using luciferase reporter systems in the primary rat Schwann cells. We identified a novel <italic>cis</italic>-acting element located 160 bp upstream from the <italic>MAG</italic> transcription initiation site. Using the identified <italic>cis</italic>-element as a bait, we performed yeast one-hybrid screening and isolated a cDNA encoding a <italic>RNF10</italic> as a putative trans-acting protein. When overexpressed in Schwann cells, RNF10 enhanced the activity of the <italic>MAG</italic> promoter. When RNF10 expression in Schwann cells was knocked down by siRNA, endogenous MAG mRNA and protein expression decreased. Furthermore, we evaluated myelin synthesis using Schwann cell-DRG neuron cocultures. When Schwann cells were infected with retrovirus expressing RNF10 siRNA, myelin formation was inhibited. These data suggest that RNF10 regulates MAG expression and is required for myelin formation.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Myelin sheath is a unique component of the nervous system. It ensheaths the axons in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and central nervous system (CNS) of vertebrates. It increases axonal conduction velocity, thereby allowing saltatory conduction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003464-Salzer1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Given the functional importance of myelin, it is of particular interest to clarify the molecular mechanisms underlying the differentiation of myelinating glial cells and formation and maintenance of myelin. It is widely accepted that several molecules expressed on axons, such as neuregulin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003464-Vartanian1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, convey axonal signals that trigger myelin-forming cells, namely, Schwann cells in the PNS, to initiate the process of myelination. Therefore, molecules expressed at the axon-glia junction are also likely to be involved in the onset of myelination. Among several myelin-membrane proteins, only myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) appears in the periaxonal area of the Schwann cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003464-Trapp1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003464-Erb1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The MAG expression is induced when a 1&#x02236;1 relationship is established between Schwann cells and axons; such a relationship facilitates the contact of the processes of each Schwann cell to the axon at the promyelinating Schwann cell stage. MAG has been detected on Schwann cell surface prior to the onset of myelination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003464-Owens1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref> and has long been thought to be involved in glia-axon interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003464-Schachner1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Previous reports have shown that MAG performs important positive functions in the differentiation of myelinating glial cells, glia-axon interactions, and myelination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003464-Quarles1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, MAG is believed to play an important role in the onset of myelination, and the regulatory mechanisms underlying MAG expression may be important in the initiation of myelination processes. Along this line, our previous study revealed that activation of the PI3K pathway induced MAG expression simultaneously with Schwann cell differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003464-Ogata1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. However, the transcriptional regulatory mechanisms underlying MAG expression remain poorly understood.

Since the expression of MAG is closely related to the onset of myelination, transcriptional regulation of the <italic>MAG</italic> gene appears to have a strong influence on the mechanism underlying the initiation of myelination. Therefore, in this study, we specifically aimed to identify the positive <italic>cis</italic>-acting element in the <italic>MAG</italic> gene and the specific transcriptional regulatory factor in Schwann cells, with the ultimate goal to elucidate the regulatory mechanisms that control the gene activity in differentiating Schwann cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>The &#x02212;162/&#x02212;143 Region is Essential for <italic>MAG</italic> Promoter Activity</title><p>To identify the <italic>cis</italic>-element(s) required for the promoter activity of the rat <italic>MAG</italic> gene, serial and internal deletion luciferase reporter constructs were analyzed in primary cultured rat Schwann cells by using transient transfection assays. The promoter region of the <italic>MAG</italic> gene obtained from rat genomic DNA was cloned into a pGL3-Basic luciferase reporter vector. To measure the basal activity, an empty pGL3-Basic vector was used as a control vector. The reporter construct p2752, containing rat <italic>MAG</italic> promoter region extending from &#x02212;2752 to &#x0002b;78, was adequate for the detection of reporter gene expression in Schwann cells. Sequential deletion of the region between &#x02212;2752 and &#x02212;162 in the rat <italic>MAG</italic> promoter caused a modest increase in the promoter activity. However, further deletion of a 9-nucleotide stretch (&#x02212;162 to &#x02212;153) resulted in a marked decrease in the reporter gene activity in Schwann cells. Deletion of the sequence between &#x02212;162 and &#x02212;153 in the p283 construct (p283&#x00394;) reduced the luciferase expression level, which was then similar to the level in p153. These data suggested that a positive regulatory element exists within the region from &#x02212;162 to &#x02212;153. The deletion analysis of the <italic>MAG</italic> promoter revealed the induction of luciferase activity in Schwann cells but much less in rat osteosarcoma (ROS) cells. Therefore, the <italic>MAG</italic> promoter would contain a Schwann cell-specific <italic>cis</italic>-acting element (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003464-g001">Fig 1A</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0003464-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0003464.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Luciferase activity of Schwann cells transiently transfected with a <italic>MAG</italic> promoter construct.</title><p>(A) Transient cotransfections of Schwann cells and ROS cells using various rat <italic>MAG</italic> reporter constructs.

A sequence with internal deletion of a segment from &#x02212;162 to &#x02212;153 was also constructed. The observed firefly luciferase activity is normalized with the Renilla luciferase activity and the results are expressed as fold induction compared with empty vector in Schwann cells. Deletion of a region between &#x02212;162 and &#x02212;153 greatly reduced the luciferase activity. In contrast, the luciferase activity showed subtle changes in the ROS cell. (B, C) To examine the positive effects of the sequence between &#x02212;162 and &#x02212;153 on the promoter activity, we generated and analyzed various lengths of tandem repeats downstream from &#x02212;162 (B) and upstream from &#x02212;143 (C). The normalized luciferase activity is expressed as fold induction compared with the value of either p162 in (B) or p77 in (C) respectively. Only the reporter constructs bearing 20-bp tandem repeats (&#x02212;162 to &#x02212;143) could increase the luciferase activity in a repeat number-dependent manner.

The 5&#x02032; deletion analysis of the <italic>MAG</italic> promoter revealed that the 20-bp sequence extending from nucleotide &#x02212;162 to &#x02212;143 could induce promoter activity at levels similar to that induced by the longest reporter construct. The 20-bp sequence <named-content content-type="gene">ACAAGGGCCCCTTTGTGCCC</named-content> (from &#x02212;162 to &#x02212;143), which contained no known transcriptional factor-binding sites, was identified as a novel <italic>cis</italic>-acting element and was designated SSE. This sequence has not been identified in previous studies related to the <italic>MAG</italic> gene promoter, probably due to the differences in experimental conditions (we used Schwann cell primary culture instead of the C6 glioma cell line, which has been used in other studies). This sequence is completely conserved in the rat, mouse, and human. We were therefore interested in using the SSE for yeast one-hybrid screening. Consequently, we identified RNF10 as a protein capable of binding to this critical segment of the <italic>MAG</italic> promoter regulatory region. The specificity of this binding was independently confirmed by EMSA and ChIP.</p><p>RNF10 is one of the members of the RNF, which has generally been implicated in the development, transcriptional regulation, signal transduction, DNA repair, apoptosis, and oncogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003464-Saurin1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover, <italic>RNF10</italic> is a highly conserved gene, exhibiting 96&#x00025; homology between rat and mouse and 90&#x00025; homology between rat and human. Some members of the RNF have been shown to bind with DNA and function as transcriptional activators <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003464-Poukka1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003464-Hakli1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. RNF10 has been recently shown to associate with Mesenchyme Homeobox 2 (MEOX2) transcription factor, which regulates the proliferation, differentiation, and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells and cardiomyocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003464-Lin1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Although RNF10 has not been investigated in the context of the nervous system, several databases have implicated its expression in the nervous system. We also confirmed the elevation in the RNF10 mRNA level in the rat embryonic PNS (data not shown). Taken together, RNF10 can be considered as a transcription factor participating in the peripheral nerve development and Schwann cell differentiation.</p><p>Our data demonstrates that RNF10 binds to the SSE in the <italic>MAG</italic> gene promoter to enhance promoter activities; however, RNF10 may require some partner molecules to perform its function. The existence of such molecules can be predicted based on the findings that the <italic>MAG</italic> gene promoter showed a higher activity in the Schwann cell background compared to that in the ROS cell background. The difference can be attributed to the lack of partner molecules in ROS cells. The precise mechanisms in the RNF, including RNF10, are not completely understood; nonetheless, RNF10 has been reported to form a complex with MEOX2 to regulate transcriptional activities. Therefore, it appears that RNF10 requires a Schwann cell-specific-binding partner to regulate Schwann cell functions. Further studies are required to elucidate such molecules, and these studies would facilitate the understanding of more precise mechanisms underlying RNF10 functions.</p><p>Using siRNA, we showed that the loss-of-function of RNF10 in Schwann cells resulted in a decreased MAG expression and reduced myelination in Schwann cell/neuron cocultures. However, in the gain-of-function experiments, the luciferase assay demonstrated that the overexpression of RNF10 in Schwann cells by vector transfection or retrovirus infection caused an increase in the <italic>MAG</italic> promoter activity; however, no detectable difference was observed in myelination when compared with the control cells (data not shown). These results suggest that RNF10 is an essential molecule for initiating myelination in Schwann cells but is not able to promote myelination independently. This interpretation is conceivable because biological processes such as myelin formation involve many steps, and the molecules in each step interact mutually to organize the processes. Therefore, it is intriguing to elucidate the relation between RNF10 and other Schwann cell-related transcriptional factors such as Oct-6 and Krox20. Since MAG expression is induced in the early stages of myelination, we assume that RNF10 participates in the initiation of myelination. Further, it is important to clarify the stage at which RNF10 is indispensable for Schwann cell differentiation by using <italic>RNF10</italic>-deficient mice.</p><p>We identified RNF10 as a transcriptional regulator of the <italic>MAG</italic> gene, but we speculate that other target molecules are also regulated by RNF10. Our results indicate that RNF10 is required for both Schwann cell myelination and MAG expression. However, considering that <italic>MAG</italic>-deficient mice are capable of forming the myelin structure with modest abnormalities in the PNS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003464-Montag1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003464-Li1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, RNF10 probably regulates myelination by not only MAG expression but also other pathways. Some sequences, similar to the SSE, exist in the gene promoter regions of the rat, mouse, and human, suggesting that RNF10 may also regulate other gene expressions. However, we have not yet identified any myelin-related genes near the SSE-like motif region. On the other hand, since the knockdown of RNF10 in Schwann cells induced cell proliferation, we conjecture that RNF10 may be involved in exiting from cell cycle to initiate terminal differentiation and myelination.</p><p>In conclusion, we prove that RNF10 binds to the MAG promoter and regulates MAG expression and myelin formation in Schwann cells. RNF10 can be considered as a regulator of Schwann cell differentiation and myelination. These results were obtained by in vitro experiments. The generation of <italic>RNF10</italic>-knockout mice should facilitate the understanding of the in vivo biological function of RNF10.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Luciferase Reporter Construction and Assay</title><p>To generate reporter construct p2752, the &#x02212;2752 to &#x0002b;78 bp of the gene (&#x0002b;1 bp: transcriptional initiation site shown in reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003464-Lai1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>) of the rat MAG promoter was subcloned into the KpnI, NheI site of pGL3-Basic (Promega).

Briefly, Schwann cells were seeded into 96-well tissue culture plates at a concentration of 3&#x000d7;10<sup>3</sup> cells/well and incubated in DMEM with 10&#x00025; FBS and antibiotics at 37&#x000b0;C. After 3 h (day0), 48 h (day2), 72 h (day4), 96 h (day6), the absorbance at the 490-nm wavelength was measured using an automated microplate reader (Bio-Tek Instruments).</p><p>BrdU incorporation assays were performed by incubating cells in 24-well culture plates and labeling with 10 &#x000b5;M bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) in medium for 18 h. Afterward, the cells were fixed for 20 min in 4&#x00025; paraformaldehyde. For BrdU immunocytochemistry, the cells were then treated with MeOH for 10 min at 4 d, followed by 2 M HCl for 30 minutes at room temperature, and reacted with primary and secondary antibodies using standard protocols. The cells were counterstained with the nuclear stain DAPI. The percentage of cells that had incorporated BrdU was quantified by determining the ratio of BrdU-positive nuclei and the total number of nuclei in 15 systematically sampled microscopic fields.</p></sec><sec id="s4i"><title>Western blotting</title><p>Rat Schwann cells on 60 mm plates were lysed in M-Per&#x02122; mammalian protein extraction reagent (Pierce) containing a complete&#x02122; mini protease inhibitor cocktail tablet (Roche). Samples containing an equal amount of protein (10 &#x000b5;g) were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Proteins were then transferred to a PVDF membrane (Bio-Rad). Primary antibodies (anti-MAG; MAB1567, Chemicon) were used in 1&#x02236;1000 dilution at room temperature for 1 hr in 3&#x00025;BSA TBS plus Tween 20. The secondary antibodies were used in 1&#x02236;10,000 dilution, and the immunoblots were developed by using the ECL system (Amersham Biosciences).</p></sec><sec id="s4j"><title>Myelination assay</title><p>DRG neuron coculture with Schwann cells was performed using the modified method of Einheber et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003464-Einheber1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. Briefly, DRGs were taken from E15 rats, dissociated with trypsin, and seeded on 12 mm dishes coated with collagen type I at 200,000 cells per well. Non-neuronal cells were removed by treating cultures with C media (MEM, 10&#x00025; FBS, 0.4&#x00025; glucose, and 100 ng/ml 2.5S NGF) supplemented with uridine, and AraC (at 10 &#x000b5;M) or with C media alone every 2&#x02013;3 d alternately for 10 d. For myelination, 250,000 retroviral-infected Schwann cells were seeded onto DRG cultures in DMEM/F12 medium with N2 supplement (Gibco) and 50 ng/ml NGF and kept for several days until axons were populated by Schwann cells. The medium was then switched to C media with 50 ng/ml ascorbic acid to promote myelination. Cocultures were kept for 2 weeks and then fixed with 4&#x00025; paraformaldehyde, and anti-MBP and anti-Tuj1 antibody diluted at 1&#x02236;200 in TBST with 3&#x00025; BSA was applied overnight at room temperature. Secondary antibodies were then added to observe myelin-forming Schwann cells by fluorescence microscopy. The number of myelin-forming Schwann cells were counted by surveying 20 fields at 200_magnification from three independent experiments and expressed by percentage ratio to that in control cultures. The average was calculated, and <italic>p</italic>- values were obtained using Student's <italic>t</italic>- test.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank all the members of our laboratory for
