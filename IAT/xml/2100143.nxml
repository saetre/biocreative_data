Almost all known RT inhibitor resistance mutations identified to date map to the polymerase domain of the enzyme. However, the connection and RNase H domains are not routinely analysed in clinical samples and none of the genotyping assays available for patient management sequence the entire RT coding region. The British Columbia Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS (the Centre) genotypes clinical isolates up to codon 400 in RT, and our retrospective statistical analyses of the Centre's database have identified an N348I mutation in the RT connection domain in treatment-experienced individuals. The objective of this multidisciplinary study was to establish the in vivo relevance of this mutation and its role in drug resistance.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Methods and Findings</title><p>The prevalence of N348I in clinical isolates, the time taken for it to emerge under selective drug pressure, and its association with changes in viral load, specific drug treatment, and known drug resistance mutations was analysed from genotypes, viral loads, and treatment histories from the Centre's database. N348I increased in prevalence from below 1&#x00025; in 368 treatment-na&#x000ef;ve individuals to 12.1&#x00025; in 1,009 treatment-experienced patients (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 7.7 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;12</sup>). N348I appeared early in therapy and was highly associated with thymidine analogue mutations (TAMs) M41L and T215Y/F (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001), the lamivudine resistance mutations M184V/I (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001), and non-nucleoside RTI (NNRTI) resistance mutations K103N and Y181C/I (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). The association with TAMs and NNRTI resistance mutations was consistent with the selection of N348I in patients treated with regimens that included both zidovudine and nevirapine (odds ratio 2.62, 95&#x00025; confidence interval 1.43&#x02013;4.81). The appearance of N348I was associated with a significant increase in viral load (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001), which was as large as the viral load increases observed for any of the TAMs. However, this analysis did not account for the simultaneous selection of other RT or protease inhibitor resistance mutations on viral load. To delineate the role of this mutation in RT inhibitor resistance, N348I was introduced into HIV-1 molecular clones containing different genetic backbones. N348I decreased zidovudine susceptibility 2- to 4-fold in the context of wild-type HIV-1 or when combined with TAMs. N348I also decreased susceptibility to nevirapine (7.4-fold) and efavirenz (2.5-fold) and significantly potentiated resistance to these drugs when combined with K103N. Biochemical analyses of recombinant RT containing N348I provide supporting evidence for the role of this mutation in zidovudine and NNRTI resistance and give some insight into the molecular mechanism of resistance.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study provides the first in vivo evidence that treatment with RT inhibitors can select a mutation (i.e., N348I) outside the polymerase domain of the HIV-1 RT that confers dual-class resistance. Its emergence, which can happen early during therapy, may significantly impact on a patient's response to antiretroviral therapies containing zidovudine and nevirapine. This study also provides compelling evidence for investigating the role of other mutations in the connection and RNase H domains in virological failure.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>Analyzing HIV sequences from a Canadian cohort, Gilda Tachedjian and colleagues identify a common mutation in a little-studied domain of reverse transcriptase that confers resistance to two drug classes.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="editor"><title>Editors' Summary</title><sec id="sb1a"><title>Background.</title><p>In the 1980s, infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), was a death sentence. Although the first antiretroviral drugs (compounds that block HIV's life cycle) were developed quickly, single antiretrovirals only transiently suppress HIV infection. HIV rapidly accumulates random changes (mutations) in its genetic material, some of which make it drug resistant. Nowadays, there are many different antiretrovirals. Some inhibit the viral protease, an enzyme used to assemble new viruses. Others block reverse transcriptase (RT), which makes replicates of the genes of the virus. Nucleoside/nucleotide RT inhibitors (NRTIs; for example, zidovudine&#x02014;also called AZT&#x02014;and lamivudine) and non-nucleoside RT inhibitors (NNRTIs; for example, nevirapine and efavirenz) interfere with the activity of RT by binding to different sites in its so-called &#x0201c;DNA polymerase domain,&#x0201d; the part of the enzyme that constructs copies of the viral genes. Highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), which was introduced in the mid 1990s, combines several antiretrovirals (usually a protease inhibitor and two NRTIs or an NNRTI and two NRTIs) so that the replication of any virus that develops resistance to one drug is inhibited by the other drugs in the mix. When treated with HAART, HIV infection is usually a chronic, stable condition rather than a fatal disease.</p></sec><sec id="sb1b"><title>Why Was This Study Done?</title><p>Unfortunately, HIV that is resistant to drugs still develops in some patients. To improve the prevention and management of drug resistance, a better understanding of the mutations that cause resistance is needed. Resistance to RT inhibitors usually involves mutations in the DNA polymerase domain that reduce the efficacy of NRTIs (including thymidine analogue mutations&#x02014;also known as TAMs&#x02014;and lamivudine-resistance mutations) and NNRTIs. Blood tests that detect these resistance mutations (genotype tests) have been used for several years to guide individualized selection of HIV drugs. Recently, however, mutations outside the DNA polymerase domain have also been implicated in resistance to RT inhibitors. In this study, the researchers have used data and samples collected since the mid 1990s by Canada's British Columbia Centre for Excellence in HIV/AIDS to investigate the clinical relevance of a mutation called N348I. This mutation changes an asparagine (a type of amino acid) to an isoleucine in a region of RT known as the connection domain. The researchers have also investigated how this mutation causes resistance to RT inhibitors in laboratory tests.</p></sec><sec id="sb1c"><title>What Did the Researchers Do and Find?</title><p>The researchers analyzed the first two-thirds of the RT gene in viruses isolated from a large number of the Centre's patients. Virus carrying the N348I mutation was present in less than one in 100 patients whose HIV infection had never been treated, but in more than one in 10 treatment-experienced patients. The mutation appeared early in therapy, often in viruses that had TAMs, a lamivudine-resistance mutation called M184V/I, and/or NNRTI resistance mutations. Patients treated with zidovudine and nevirapine were 2.6 times more likely to have the N348I mutation than patients not treated with these drugs. Furthermore, the appearance of the N348I mutation often coincided with an increase in viral load, although other mutations that appeared at a similar time could have contributed to this increase. When the researchers introduced the N348I mutation into HIV growing in the laboratory, they found that it decreased the susceptibility of the virus to zidovudine and to NNRTIs.</p></sec><sec id="sb1d"><title>What Do These Findings Mean?</title><p>These findings show that the treatment of patients with RT inhibitors can select a drug-resistant HIV variant that has a mutation outside the enzyme's DNA polymerase domain. Because this N348I mutation, which is commonly selected in vivo and has also been seen in other studies, confers resistance to two classes of RT inhibitors and can emerge early during therapy, it could have a large impact on patient responses to antiviral regimens that contain zidovudine and nevirapine. Although these findings do not show that the N348I mutation alone causes treatment failure, they may have implications for genotypic and phenotypic resistance testing, which is often used to guide treatment decisions. At present, genotype tests for resistance to RT inhibitors look for mutations only in the DNA polymerase domain of RT. This study is the first to demonstrate that it might be worth looking for the N348I mutation (and for other mutations outside the DNA polymerase domain) to improve the ability of genotypic and phenotypic resistance tests to predict treatment outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="sb1e"><title>Additional Information.</title><p>Please access these Web sites via the online version of this summary at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0040335">http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0040335</ext-link>.</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Information is available from the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.niaid.nih.gov/factsheets/hivinf.htm">HIV infection and AIDS</ext-link></p></list-item><list-item><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hivinsite.ucsf.edu/InSite">HIV InSite</ext-link> has comprehensive information on all aspects of HIV/AIDS, including links to fact sheets (in English, French, and Spanish) about <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hivinsite.ucsf.edu/InSite?page=md-rr-20">antiretrovirals</ext-link>, and chapters explaining <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hivinsite.ucsf.edu/InSite?page=kb-00&#x00026;doc=kb-03-02-07">antiretroviral resistance testing</ext-link></p></list-item><list-item><p>NAM, a UK registered charity, provides information about all aspects of <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.aidsmap.com/">HIV and AIDS</ext-link>, including fact sheets on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.aidsmap.com/cms1031987.asp">types of HIV drugs</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.aidsmap.com/en/docs/F349BF95-1805-48DB-952E-C2612DA40F3E.asp">drug resistance</ext-link>, and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.aidsmap.com/en/docs/E12C6ADB-A9E7-4052-89AA-55E2C603F0AE.asp">resistance tests</ext-link> (in English, Spanish, French, Portuguese, and Russian)</p></list-item><list-item><p>The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention provides information on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/">HIV/AIDS</ext-link> and on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cdc.gov/hiv/topics/treatment/index.htm">treatment</ext-link> (in English and Spanish)</p></list-item><list-item><p>AIDSinfo, a service of the US Department of Health and Human Services provides information for patients on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.aidsinfo.nih.gov/ContentFiles/HIVandItsTreatment_cbrochure_en.pdf">HIV and its treatment</ext-link></p></list-item></list></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Yap SH, Sheen CW, Fahey J, Zanin M, Tyssen D, et al.

Due to its essential role in HIV replication, RT is a major target for chemotherapeutic intervention. In this regard, 11 of the 24 anti&#x02013;HIV-1 inhibitors approved by the US Food and Drug Administration are RT inhibitors (RTIs). These can be divided into two therapeutic classes: (i) the nucleoside/nucleotide RT inhibitors (NRTIs), such as zidovudine (AZT) and lamivudine (3TC), that bind in the active site of the RT and act as competitive chain terminating inhibitors of DNA polymerisation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040335-b003">3</xref>&#x0005d;; and the non-nucleoside RT inhibitors (NNRTIs), such as nevirapine (NVP) and efavirenz (EFV), that bind to a nonactive site pocket in the HIV-1 RT (termed NNRTI-binding pocket) and act as allosteric inhibitors of DNA polymerisation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040335-b004">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040335-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>HIV-1 RT is an asymmetric dimer that consists of a 66-kDa (p66) subunit and a p66-derived 51-kDa (p51) subunit. The catalytically active p66 subunit comprises the DNA polymerase (residues 1&#x02013;315), connection (residues 316&#x02013;437), and ribonuclease H (RNase H; residues 438&#x02013;560) domains &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040335-b007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040335-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;.

A more recent study that performed genotypic and phenotypic analyses from a small number of NRTI-experienced and treatment-na&#x000ef;ve individuals demonstrated that the C-terminal domains obtained from treatment-na&#x000ef;ve patients did not increase AZT resistance compared to wild-type (WT) virus &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040335-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;. By contrast the same domains obtained from treatment-experienced patients conferred increased AZT resistance in the context of a WT polymerase domain by 3.6- to 5.8-fold and by 125- to 536-fold in the context of a polymerase domain encoding TAMs. Mutational studies revealed the presence of several connection domain mutations, including E312Q, G335C/D, N348I, A360I/V, V365I, and A376S, that were associated with AZT resistance &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040335-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;.

For this study, we limited our measure of adherence to the first year of therapy estimated by dividing the number of months of medications dispensed by the number of months of follow-up. This measure of adherence has been found to be independently associated with HIV-1 viral suppression and survival amongst HIV-1-infected persons enrolled in the HIV/AIDS Drug Treatment Program &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040335-b020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040335-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;.

A backward stepwise technique was used in the selection of covariates. The selection of variables was based on two criteria: Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Type III <italic>p</italic>-values. These two criteria balance the model choice on finding the best explanatory model (Type III <italic>p</italic>-values: lower <italic>p</italic>-values indicate more significance) and at the same time a model with the best goodness-of-fit statistic (AIC: lower values indicate better fit). AIC is a criterion that penalised larger models, with equal fit. It can be used to compare models of different size, provided they are nested within each other. At each step of this process, the AIC value and the Type III <italic>p</italic>-values of each variable are recorded. Also at each step, the variable with the highest Type III <italic>p</italic>-value is dropped until there are no more variables left in the model. The final model is the model with the lowest AIC.

In general, N348I appeared at the same time as M184V/I and before the appearance of TAMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0040335-g002">Figure 2</xref>). N348I also usually appeared at the same time as key NNRTI resistance mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0040335-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Notably, N348I was the first mutation that was observed in two patients (patients 5 and 16, with viral loads of 1,120 and 591,000 copies/ml, respectively) indicating an association with virological failure.</p><fig id="pmed-0040335-g002" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Pattern of Emergence of N348I Early in Drug Therapy Failure</title><p>The pattern of emergence of N348I relative to key drug resistance mutations in the RT is shown with respect to days post therapy.

N348I is more prevalent in clinical samples from patients treated with RTIs compared with samples from treatment-na&#x000ef;ve individuals. In this regard, our analysis ranks N348I as the ninth most prevalent resistance mutation from a total of 39 different RT codons that were evaluated in RTI experienced patients and this mutation was observed more frequently in our cohort than mutations at codons 210, 69, 44, 190, 118, and 74, most of which have been the topic of multiple clinical, genetic, virological, biochemical and structural analyses &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040335-b059">59</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040335-b063">63</xref>&#x0005d;. As expected with HIV, there was a strong codon bias, with most of the mutant N348I (98.6&#x00025;) encoded by ATT, while more than 97&#x00025; of WT N348 was encoded by AAT. Furthermore, the N348I mutation is associated with M184V/I, TAMs, K103N and Y181C and is selected by NVP and AZT treatment. The N348I mutation also appears relatively early in virological failure, generally before the appearance of TAMs and usually at the same time as the acquisition of NNRTI resistance mutations. Notably, N348I was the first mutation observed in two patients in our cohort. The early appearance of N348I after initiation of antiretroviral therapy is consistent with it playing a key role in the development of RTI resistance rather than being an accessory mutation that appears after primary mutations &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040335-b064">64</xref>&#x0005d;. This is supported by our findings that its appearance is associated with an increase in viral load, which is at least as large as that observed for any of the other TAMs.</p><p>The high prevalence of N348I is not unique to the Centre's database as it was also identified in a separate analysis of mutations beyond RT codon 240 in a large US clinical database (Quest Diagnostics) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040335-b065">65</xref>&#x0005d;. In the latter study, two sets of sequences were analysed. The first comprised 41,122 de-identified clinical samples collected between January 2002 and June 2003 and the second comprised 16,449 samples collected between July 2003 and December 2003. Viruses with at least one resistance mutation in the protease or RT (64.8&#x00025; in dataset 1 and 57&#x00025; in dataset 2) were compared with those that contained no key drug resistance mutations (35.2&#x00025;, dataset 1). The frequency of N348I in the first and second datasets was 13.6&#x00025; and 13.0&#x00025;, respectively. A recent study also demonstrates the presence of N348I in RT sequences from over 3,000 treated individuals with subtype B HIV-1 in a UK database &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040335-b066">66</xref>&#x0005d;. Thus, the prevalence of N348I in three large databases indicates that this mutation is likely to be present in other clade B cohorts receiving antiretroviral therapy.</p><p>To delineate the role of N348I in RTI resistance, this mutation was introduced into molecular HIV-1 clones with defined genetic backbones. In this regard, N348I, alone or in combination with TAMs, conferred 2- to 4-fold AZT resistance. The level of AZT resistance conferred by N348I alone is comparable to the levels of resistance conferred by other individual TAMs. For example, the M41L mutation has been reported to confer between 1.4- to 4-fold AZT resistance, the K70R mutation up to 8-fold resistance, and T215Y up to 16-fold resistance &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040335-b059">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040335-b060">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040335-b062">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040335-b067">67</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040335-b068">68</xref>&#x0005d;. Furthermore, other groups have also recently demonstrated that the N348I mutation confers both AZT and NNRTI resistance; with the Monogram group reporting a 2.4-fold change in AZT susceptibility &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040335-b069">69</xref>&#x0005d;, while another group reported a 23-fold change in AZT susceptibility &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040335-b070">70</xref>&#x0005d;. In addition, a recent study demonstrated that reversion of N348I to the WT codon in an RT gene from an isolate derived from an RTI-experienced patient increased AZT sensitivity 5- to 10-fold &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040335-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;. Interestingly, N348I also conferred decreased susceptibility to EFV and NVP, data that are also consistent with studies from other groups &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040335-b069">69</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040335-b070">70</xref>&#x0005d;. In our cohort N348I was associated with the appearance of K103N, V108l, Y181C/I, and G190A/S early in virological failure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0040335-g002">Figure 2</xref>) and was significantly associated with these mutations in analysis of the entire database (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0040335-g001">Figure 1</xref>). N348I significantly potentiated EFV and NVP resistance when combined with K103N. Consistent with our cell culture&#x02013;based assays, NNRTI resistance was also observed at the enzyme level with recombinant RT expressing N348I. Furthermore, the phenotypic findings are consistent with our clinical data demonstrating the significant association of N348I with TAMs and NNRTI mutations and its selection in patients on AZT and NVP combination therapy.</p><p>N348I was also significantly associated with M184V/I in our cohort. N348I conferred a small increase in 3TC resistance in the context of TAMs but did not counteract the previously observed antagonism between M184V and TAMs. This is in contrast to another connection domain mutation, G333D/E, which is associated with dual resistance to AZT and 3TC &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040335-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;. It is curious that our data demonstrate a strong association of N348I with M184V/I despite it having little effect on drug susceptibility in the context of M184V. However, this can be explained by several possibilities, including that M184V/I and N348I are not genetically linked, that their coincident emergence is due to a high proportion of the Centre's cohort being prescribed 3TC, or that N348I has an effect on M184V/I that is independent of decreasing drug susceptibility such as altering viral fitness. Further studies will be needed to address these possibilities.</p><p>Apart from Q145M, which has been reported to confer broad resistance to several NRTIs and NNRTIs &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040335-b071">71</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040335-b072">72</xref>&#x0005d;, and Y181C/I, which may confer resistance to stavudine in addition to NVP &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040335-b073">73</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040335-b074">74</xref>&#x0005d;, N348I represents the only other example of an in vivo mutation that confers decreased susceptibility to two classes of RT inhibitors. However, in contrast to N348I, the prevalence of Q145M in an Italian cohort of 3,595 patients was lower (2.36&#x00025;) and was always found in the presence of key drug resistance mutations &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040335-b072">72</xref>&#x0005d;. In our cohort, Q145M was exceedingly rare with a prevalence of less than 0.5&#x00025;. Additional studies also demonstrate that Q145M significantly decreases viral replication capacity and that the recombinant enzyme displays a large loss in catalytic efficiency &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040335-b072">72</xref>&#x0005d;. While the effect of N348I on viral replication fitness has not been established, recombinant enzymes harbouring this mutation facilitate DNA synthesis reactions at least as efficiently as the WT enzyme (unpublished data).</p><p>Biochemical analyses designed to elucidate the mechanism by which N348I confers AZT resistance indicate that this mutation, consistent with other TAMs, acts by an excision rather than discrimination phenotype. However, an increase in AZT excision was only observed with a RNA/DNA T/P and not with a DNA/DNA T/P. Recently, it was suggested that mutations in the RT that decrease RNase H activity will enhance the AZT excision phenotype by slowing down the rate at which the RNA template strand is degraded &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040335-b013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040335-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d;. In this regard, our analyses confirm that the N348I mutation, alone and in combination with TAMs, decreases the enzyme's RNase H activity. In particular, the mutation significantly reduces the appearance of a 17-nucleotide secondary cleavage product, which corresponds to RNA/DNA duplex length of ten nucleotides. Recent studies that were designed to delineate the relationship between T/P duplex length and efficiency of AZT excision demonstrated that RT could not efficiently unblock chain-terminated T/P if the RNA/DNA duplex length was less than 13 nucleotides &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040335-b075">75</xref>&#x0005d;. Thus, the decrease in the formation of this cleavage product is significant and suggests a possible mechanism by which N348I confers AZT resistance. The structural mechanism by which N348I confers AZT (and NNRTI) resistance, however, cannot be inferred from this study. Recent studies have demonstrated that mutations in the RNase H primer grip region can significantly enhance AZT resistance by changing interactions between RT and the T/P complex and/or shifting the balance between the polymerase and RNase H activities &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040335-b015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040335-b076">76</xref>&#x0005d;. In contrast, N348I does not make direct contacts with the T/P. Furthermore, N348 in p66 RT is 27 &#x000c5; away from the polymerase active site and 20 &#x000c5; from the NNRTI-binding pocket, while N348 in p51 RT is 60 &#x000c5; from the NNRTI-binding pocket (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0040335-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Interestingly, N348 in p66 lies in close proximity to I270 and P272 at the base of the thumb domain in some crystal structures, suggesting a possible mechanism by which N348I mediates AZT resistance &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040335-b077">77</xref>&#x0005d;. Nevertheless, additional biochemical and structural studies are warranted to define the exact mechanism by which N348I confers RTI resistance.</p><fig id="pmed-0040335-g005" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Position of N348 in the HIV-1 RT Structure</title><p>Structural model of HIV-1 demonstrating the position of N348 in the p66 (blue) and p51 RT (pink) subunits relative to the polymerase active site (gold spheres), the NNRTI-binding pocket (green) and the dimer interface (gold).

Nevertheless, this caveat also applies to our analysis of the individual TAMs. Even with this large study, the number of permutations of mutations is too large to be able to exclude the contribution of other mutations, particularly as these patients are on combination therapy. Nevertheless, this study represents, to our knowledge, the most thorough evaluation of the in vivo relevance of a drug resistance mutation that can contribute to HIV drug resistance, but is not presently included in most genotypic and phenotypic resistance assays.</p><p>In conclusion, we have demonstrated that a mutation in the connection domain of the HIV-1 RT, N348I, is prevalent in drug-treated individuals, appears relatively early in drug therapy, and confers decreased susceptibility to AZT and NNRTIs. The mechanism of AZT resistance can be ascribed to increased nucleotide excision, as observed from an RNA/DNA T/P, and is likely to be manifested through decreased RNase H activity conferred by N348I. Decreased susceptibility to NNRTIs can be demonstrated at the enzyme level. Taken together, our data underscore the important role of N348I in conferring drug resistance to AZT and NNRTIs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><sec id="s5a"><title>Accession Numbers</title><p>The GenBank (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Genbank">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Genbank</ext-link>) accession numbers for NL4.3 and HXB-2 are U26942 and K03455, respectively.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program, Division of AIDS, National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, NIH, for the supply of efavirenz, nevirapine, lamivudine and zidovudine, and TZM-bl cells.
