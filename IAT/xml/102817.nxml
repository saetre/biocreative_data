Thiostrepton, which binds to the &#x02018;GTPase center&#x02019; of the large subunit, has been postulated to prevent conformational changes in either the L11 protein or rRNA to which it binds. Scintillation proximity assays designed to look at the binding of the L11 C-terminal RNA-binding domain to a 23S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) fragment, as well as the ability of thiostrepton to induce that binding, were used to demonstrate the role of Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, L11 and thiostrepton in the formation and maintenance of the rRNA fragment tertiary structure. Experiments using these assays with both an <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> rRNA fragment and a thermostable variant of that RNA show that Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, L11 and thiostrepton all induce the RNA to fold to an essentially identical tertiary structure.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Many antibiotics that interfere with ribosome function protect specific regions of rRNA from chemical modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd289c1">1</xref>) and probably derive much of their binding affinity from direct contacts with the rRNA. It is attractive to think that antibiotic-induced stabilization of rRNA structure could be a common mechanism of antibiotic action, for instance by folding the RNA into a non-functional structure or by preventing a conformation change that normally takes place during the ribosome cycle. One candidate for such a mechanism is thiostrepton, which binds to the &#x02018;GTPase center&#x02019; of the large subunit, comprised of a highly conserved region of large subunit rRNA, ribosomal protein L11 and the L10(L12)<sub>4</sub> complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd289c2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd289c5">5</xref>), and inhibits ribosome function.</p><p>Two mechanisms have been proposed for the inhibitory effect of thiostrepton. Both suppose that the GTPase center cycles between different conformations as elongation factors bind and are released, and that thiostrepton prevents a conformational transition within the center. In the &#x02018;RNA-centric&#x02019; proposal, the critical conformational transitions take place in the RNA: L11 stimulates translation by promoting the correct transition(s), and thiostrepton inhibits translation by stabilizing one of the rRNA conformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd289c6">6</xref>). In support of this, binding studies have suggested that <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> L11 can recognize differently folded RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd289c7">7</xref>). A &#x02018;protein-centric&#x02019; view is based on the recent observation that mutations conferring thiostrepton resistance are located in the L11 N-terminal domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd289c8">8</xref>). This view has also been proposed for the action of the closely related antibiotic, micrococcin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd289c9">9</xref>). As antibiotic binds normally to these ribosomes but no longer affects translation, it was proposed that thiostrepton prevents a conformation transition in L11.</p><p>The present work examines the interactions between thiostrepton, a C-terminal RNA binding domain of L11 (L11-C76) and a 103 nt fragment of rRNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd289f1">1</xref>), with two purposes in mind. First, we ask whether thiostrepton and L11-C76 recognize very similar or very different RNA conformations. The answer to this question bears on whether the &#x02018;RNA-centric&#x02019; model of thiostrepton action is feasible. Our second interest is in developing assays that can be used to screen libraries of small molecules for those with potential for antibiotic activity. Two classes of compounds that act at the level of the ribosome can be envisioned. A first class would disrupt a ribosomal protein&#x02013;RNA interaction, affecting ribosome assembly or function. Such compounds can be detected simply by their ability to prevent protein association with an rRNA target. Alternatively, a compound could stabilize one conformation of an RNA or RNA&#x02013;protein complex, as proposed in the case of thiostrepton. In the present work we show how a protein&#x02013;RNA binding assay can be set up to detect compounds that stabilize RNA tertiary structure by their stimulation of protein binding.</p><p>The separate interactions of thiostrepton, L11 or Mg ions with the tertiary structure of a 23S rRNA fragment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd289f1">1</xref>) have been characterized. Nucleotides 1051&#x02013;1108 form a tightly folded tertiary structure whose stability depends critically on the presence of Mg ions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd289c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd289c11">11</xref>). The binding of L11 to this region stabilizes the rRNA tertiary structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd289c12">12</xref>); recent crystal structures of the protein&#x02013;RNA complex show the C-terminal domain of L11 directly contacting a key tertiary interaction taking place in the minor groove of the helix on either side of U1060&#x02013;U1078 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd289c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd289c14">14</xref>). Thiostrepton binds the same rRNA fragments with &#x000b5;M dissociation constants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd289c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd289c16">16</xref>), probably in a pocket of the rRNA structure formed by the two hairpin loops shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd289f1">1</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd289c17">17</xref>), and also stabilizes tertiary structure within the 1051&#x02013;1108 rRNA fragment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd289c18">18</xref>). Binding of thiostrepton is enhanced 100&#x02013;1000-fold when L11 protein is present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd289c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd289c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd289c20">20</xref>), but this stimulation depends on the presence of an N-terminal domain in L11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd289c19">19</xref>). In the present studies we have used only L11-C76, the C-terminal domain of L11 lacking any intrinsic interactions with thiostrepton, in order to focus on the effects of L11 and thiostrepton on the rRNA tertiary structure. Although thiostrepton and L11-C76 both stabilize tertiary structure within the rRNA domain, it is not known whether the stabilized conformation is the same in both cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd289c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd289c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd289c19">19</xref>).</p><p>A nitrocellulose filter binding assay has been used in previous studies of L11 and thiostrepton interactions. As L11 and thiostrepton both retain rRNA on filters, the assay cannot be used to measure binding of one ligand in the presence of the other. Thus we have turned to scintillation proximity assays (SPAs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd289c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd289c22">22</xref>), which have several advantages over filter binding assays for making equilibrium measurements and have been shown to give reliable and reproducible results with well-characterized interactions (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd289c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd289c24">24</xref> as just two such examples). Here we use SPAs to examine the way rRNA tertiary folding is linked to binding of Mg ions, L11-C76 and thiostrepton, and show that all three ligands stabilize essentially the same rRNA tertiary structure.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>L11<bold>-</bold>C76 protein</title><p>L11-C76, which contains the C-terminal 75 residues of the <italic>Bacillus stearothermophilus</italic> L11 protein, was prepared from an overproducing strain as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd289c19">19</xref>).

Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd289f2">2</xref>A shows the binding scheme that is expected if this assertion is true. The first step, <italic>K</italic><sub>I</sub>, is folding of a specific tertiary structure, which is known to be strongly dependent on Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> concentration in this RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd289c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd289c28">28</xref>). In the next two steps, this folded structure may bind L11 (via its C-terminal domain) and thiostrepton, in either order. Finally, interaction of the L11 N-terminal domain further stabilizes the complex. Complex 4 would not normally be observable, as the strong interaction of the L11 N-terminus with thiostrepton would heavily favor formation of complex 5. However, a complex of L11-C76, thiostrepton and RNA, which lacks the L11&#x02013;thiostrepton interaction, would be equivalent to complex 4. This scheme makes two important predictions: (i) if sufficient Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> is added to drive the RNA entirely into the tertiary structure 2, then L11-C76 should have the same apparent affinity whether or not thiostrepton is present (conversely, binding of thiostrepton should be independent of L11-C76); (ii) if the RNA is largely in the unfolded state 1, then addition of thiostrepton should promote folding of the tertiary structure and enhance binding of L11-C76, and vice versa. This is the simplest possible form of allostery, in which a ligand drives a macromolecular conformational transition and thereby affects the binding of another ligand at a second site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd289c29">29</xref>).</p><p>There are several more complicated binding schemes for which the above two predictions would not hold. Two are important to consider here. (i) Suppose that thiostrepton and L11 bind different RNA conformations, both of which are stabilized by Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd289f2">2</xref>B). In that case, thiostrepton and L11 should compete for binding and complex 4 would be less stable than the individual complexes. However, the ternary L11&#x02013;thiostrepton&#x02013;RNA complex 5 could still form because of the additional interaction contributed by the N-terminus. (For simplicity, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd289f2">2</xref>B shows complex 5 in the thiostrepton-bound conformation, since the main interaction with L11 is via its N-terminus and not the C-terminal RNA binding domain. Other conformations could be imagined.) This model predicts that L11-C76 and thiostrepton should show competition (or anticooperativity) in RNA binding (complex 4). (ii) Instead of promoting formation of a tertiary structure encompassing the entire rRNA domain, thiostrepton and L11-C76 could induce local conformational changes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd289f2">2</xref>C). Binding of one ligand would then be independent of the other, but, in contrast to the situation in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd289f2">2</xref>A, independent binding would persist even at low Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> concentrations that destabilize tertiary structure.</p><p>The experiments reported below are consistent with the rRNA fragment adopting a unique tertiary structure, as in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd289f2">2</xref>A, and rule out the schemes in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd289f2">2</xref>B and C. To discuss these binding experiments, we define the necessary equilibrium constants and derive equations that predict L11-C76 binding isotherms at various Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> and thiostrepton concentrations. We start with the equilibrium between a folded RNA with secondary structure (RNA<sub>S</sub>) and one with tertiary structure (RNA<sub>T</sub>):</p><p>RNA<sub>S</sub> &#x0003d; RNA<sub>T</sub><italic>K</italic><sub>I</sub> &#x0003d; &#x0005b;RNA<sub>T</sub>&#x0005d;&#x0002f;&#x0005b;RNA<sub>S</sub>&#x0005d;</p><p>In many RNAs, folding of tertiary structure is very dependent on the concentration of Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, and this sensitivity has been demonstrated for the RNA considered here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd289c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd289c28">28</xref>).

When a probe labeled with <sup>3</sup>H, <sup>125</sup>I or <sup>33</sup>P is captured by the bead it brings the isotope close to the scintillant resulting in light emission. Free probe does not excite the scintillant and does not contribute to the signal. This obviates the need for separation of captured and free probe from a reaction mixture. For the work reported here, L11-C76 is biotinylated to interact with a streptavidin coated SPA bead, and the RNA used is homogeneously labeled with &#x0005b;<sup>33</sup>P&#x0005d;UTP. The concentration of labeled RNA is insignificant in comparison to that of the added protein, so that the concentration of free protein is approximately equal to the total protein concentration.</p><p>To test the reliability of the SPA, we first used a 103 nt fragment of the <italic>E.coli</italic> rRNA sequence, U1061A, in which a single U&#x02192;A mutation has greatly stabilized the RNA tertiary structure relative to the wild-type <italic>E.coli</italic> sequence (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd289f1">1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd289c27">27</xref>). The SPA assay measures the ability of the biotinylated L11-C76 protein to bind, or capture, the labeled RNA fragment. Recognition and binding of the RNA by the protein requires that the RNA be folded in a favorable conformation. Titration of the RNA with biotinylated L11-C76 gave a strong signal over background (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd289f3">3</xref>A). Inclusion of tRNA in the reaction buffer did not alter the signal, indicating the binding reaction was specific (data not shown). Based on the recognition of the RNA fragment by the L11-C76 protein, the tertiary structure appears to be fully folded at Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> concentrations &#x02265;2 mM. Dissociation constants calculated from these data, 28 &#x000b1; 3.9 nM at 5 mM Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> and 44&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;3.4 nM at 2 mM Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, are quite comparable to the 36 &#x000b1; 5 nM determined by filter binding assay for the same RNA under nearly identical conditions (10 mM MOPS pH 7.0, 3 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 175 mM KCl) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd289c28">28</xref>), but using unmodified L11-C76. Biotinylation of the L11-C76 protein (at 1&#x02013;1.5 biotins per molecule) does not significantly affect the dissociation constant as determined by filter assay (data not shown). A SPA titration done at 0.5 mM Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> does not as cleanly fit a binding isotherm, but clearly indicates that binding is taking place in approximately the same concentration range as the titrations at higher &#x0005b;Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>&#x0005d;. (A fraction of misfolded RNAs may account for the lower extent of binding at 0.5 mM Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, as the RNA renatures to form the tertiary structure very slowly under these conditions.) We conclude from these assays that SPA using biotinylated L11-C76 gives reliable binding constants, and that protein binding to U1061A RNA is not strongly dependent on magnesium ion concentration over the range 0.5&#x02013;5 mM.</p></sec><sec><title>Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> stimulates L11<bold>-</bold>C76 binding to an RNA with unstable tertiary structure</title><p>The <italic>E.coli</italic> rRNA fragment binding L11 has a marginally stable tertiary structure: in melting studies, a distinct tertiary unfolding transition is only observed in the presence of &#x0003e;2 mM Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, and &#x0003e;10 mM Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> is required before the structure is completely formed at room temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd289c10">10</xref>). Binding of full-length L11 to this RNA was previously shown to depend strongly on Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd289c12">12</xref>). Half-maximal stimulation of protein binding occurred at 0.6 mM Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> when assayed at 0&#x000b0;C; this concentration is lower than that required to observe the presence of tertiary structure in melting experiments presumably because the protein helps drive the RNA into a folded state.</p><p>SPA titrations with biotinylated L11-C76 and the <italic>E.coli</italic> rRNA fragment also show a large effect of Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>; binding is nearly undetectable at 0.5 mM Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, but is detectable at 2 mM Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> with a dissociation constant of 140 &#x000b1; 23 nM (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd289f3">3</xref>B).

Here we have circumvented this problem by developing a more versatile protocol based on SPA technology, and use this assay to ask whether thiostrepton affects L11-C76 binding to the two RNAs. With U1061A RNA, addition of 20 &#x000b5;M thiostrepton had only a marginal effect on the apparent protein affinity (16&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;1 nM without thiostrepton, 12.2 &#x000b1; 1 nM with thiostrepton; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd289f4">4</xref>A). Ten percent DMSO, needed to solubilize thiostrepton, was included in both titrations; this accounts for the tighter affinity measured here than in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd289f3">3</xref>A. Though we do not have an independent measure of thiostrepton interaction with the RNA in the SPA, the antibiotic is known to bind U1061A RNA with an affinity of 1.1 &#x000b5;M under similar buffer conditions as used here (2&#x00025; DMSO, 30 mM Tris pH 7.6, 175 mM KCl, 11&#x000a0;mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd289c16">16</xref>). The weak effect of thiostrepton on L11-C76 binding at this high concentration argues that binding of the two ligands is nearly independent.</p><p>When titrating the <italic>E.coli</italic> RNA fragment with L11-C76 at 0.5&#x000a0;mM Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, 20 &#x000b5;M thiostrepton dramatically stimulates L11-C76 binding (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd289f4">4</xref>B). In the presence of thiostrepton, the apparent <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> is 312 &#x000b1; 48 nM.

This is the expected result if Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> stabilizes a conformation recognized by both protein and antibiotic, and if there is no interaction between the two ligands.</p></sec><sec><title>Apparent affinity of TS for unfolded RNA</title><p>An alternative way to examine the interplay between RNA folding, thiostrepton and L11-C76 is to titrate protein with thiostrepton in the presence of a constant amount of RNA. Under conditions such that the RNA is largely unfolded, the extent of protein&#x02013;RNA complex formation is then a readout of thiostrepton interaction with RNA. Such a titration of <italic>E.coli</italic> RNA at low Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> concentration (0.5 mM) is shown in Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd289f5">5</xref>. As expected, the extent of RNA binding starts at a low value in the absence of thiostrepton and saturates at high antibiotic concentrations (&#x0003e;20 &#x000b5;M). The data have been fit to equation <bold>2</bold> using an estimate of <italic>K</italic><sub>P</sub> as 24 nM, the affinity measured in 5&#x000a0;mM Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd289f4">4</xref>C). The fitted value of <italic>K</italic><sub>TS</sub> is then 1.21 &#x000b1; 0.48 &#x000b5;M, and <italic>K</italic><sub>I</sub> is 60 &#x000b1; 25. <italic>K</italic><sub>TS</sub> is comparable to values measured by filter binding assays for the same RNA under high Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd289c16">16</xref>). There is no independent estimate of <italic>K</italic><sub>I</sub> as the <italic>E.coli</italic> RNA tertiary structure is undetectable under these conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd289c10">10</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>We have used a SPA assay to examine the ability of L11-C76 to recognize the tertiary structures of a fragment of the 23S rRNA formed in the presence of various amounts of Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> and thiostrepton. When we used the <italic>E.coli</italic> rRNA variant U1061A in the assay, the binding of L11-C76 was virtually independent of Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> concentration over a wide range (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd289f3">3</xref>A). The <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> of this interaction (at 2 mM Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>) is &#x0223c;44 nM. U1061A has been shown previously to fold into a very stable tertiary structure recognized by L11-C76 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd289c27">27</xref>). When the wild-type <italic>E.coli</italic> RNA fragment corresponding to U1061A is used, binding of L11-C76 is highly dependent on Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> concentration (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd289f3">3</xref>B). Under relatively high Mg concentrations (2&#x02013;5 mM) the RNA assumes a conformation recognized by L11-C76, but under lower Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> concentrations (&#x0003c;1 mM) binding is essentially eliminated. At 2&#x000a0;mM Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> the <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> between the <italic>E.coli</italic> rRNA sequence and L11-C76 is &#x0223c;140 nM. The similar <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> values obtained with the intrinsically stable RNA fragment and the <italic>E.coli</italic> fragment under higher Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> conditions demonstrate that Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> can induce the <italic>E.coli</italic> RNA fragment to adopt a tertiary conformation that is recognized by L11-C76 and essentially the same as that of the U1061A variant.</p><p>The binding of L11-C76 to U1061A RNA is not affected by thiostrepton (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd289f4">4</xref>A), although recent work in our laboratory has demonstrated that thiostrepton does interact directly with this RNA (S.Hofstadler, L.B.Blyn, K.Lowery and J.Drader, unpublished results). The lack of competition between L11-C76 and thiostrepton in binding U1061A RNA argues against the model in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd289f2">2</xref>B and in favor of the two ligands recognizing the same RNA tertiary structure. Thiostrepton, like Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, does have a demonstrable effect on the binding of L11-C76 to the <italic>E.coli</italic> rRNA sequence. This strong stimulatory effect is demonstrated under low Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> conditions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd289f4">4</xref>B), where the L11-C76 <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> is not quantifiable in the absence of thiostrepton but is only 2-fold weaker (312 nM) in the presence of 20 &#x000b5;M thiostrepton than at higher Mg ion concentration. The same stimulatory effect is observed when the L11-C76 concentration is held constant and thiostrepton is titrated (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd289f5">5</xref>). This strong cooperativity rules out the model in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd289f2">2</xref>C that assumes independent binding of L11 and thiostrepton to local, Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-stabilized RNA structures. Instead, thiostrepton induces folding of the RNA into a conformation recognized by L11-C76 as well as the RNA conformation induced by Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>.</p><p>Our conclusion from these results is that thiostrepton and L11-C76 both recognize essentially the same Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-stabilized RNA tertiary structure, in agreement with the model presented in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd289f2">2</xref>A. Under high Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> conditions, the two ligands bind nearly independently to the RNA, demonstrating that there is neither an intrinsic cooperative interaction between them nor competition for different RNA conformations. Under low Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> conditions, binding of the two ligands is mutually stimulatory because of their binding to the same RNA structure. The RNA structures stabilized by L11, thiostrepton and Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> can differ only in very minor ways: the apparent cooperativity factors between L11-C76 and thiostrepton in binding U1061A RNA is only 1.3-fold; L11-C76 binds Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> and thiostrepton-stabilized <italic>E.coli</italic> RNA with <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub>s differing by only 2-fold. (The 3.2-fold difference between L11-C76 binding Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-stabilized <italic>E.coli</italic> RNA and U1061A RNA, though still very small, could be due to subtle conformational differences between the two RNAs.) A difference of a single stacked or unstacked base in the recognized RNA structures could have caused these ratios to be as large as 10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd289c29">29</xref>).</p><p>We note that our conclusion in favor of the Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd289f2">2</xref>A model for thiostrepton and L11-C76 binding argues against the simplest formulations of an &#x02018;RNA-centric&#x02019; model of L11 and thiostrepton activity, i.e. there is no evidence that the RNA tertiary structure recognized by L11 switches between alternative conformations. Schemes in which the RNA binding domain of L11 transiently dissociates from the RNA and allows unfolding of the tertiary structure, or in which the N-terminal domain of L11 affects rRNA conformation elsewhere in the ribosome, have not been ruled out.</p><p>The information and assays described in this work will aid in the discovery of new types of antibiotics that function at the same site of action as thiostrepton. Solubility and other issues make thiostrepton a relatively poor commercial antibiotic that is mainly used in topical applications. The discovery of new antibiotics that function at the same site as thiostrepton, but are substantially different in nature would be highly valuable. The results described here demonstrate that the RNA structure recognized by thiostrepton and by L11 are fundamentally the same. The recent reports of the L11&#x0002f;23S rRNA fragment crystal structure provide an opportunity to model thiostrepton into the structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd289c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd289c14">14</xref>). This will give valuable information towards the effort to design and discover new drugs that bind and function in the same way. The assays described here also provide a mechanism for the high throughput screening of drug candidates for the ability to affect L11&#x0002f;RNA binding and for their ability to stabilize RNA structure as in the case of thiostrepton.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkd289f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Sequence and secondary structure of the &#x02018;GTPase center&#x02019; RNA from <italic>E.coli</italic>.
