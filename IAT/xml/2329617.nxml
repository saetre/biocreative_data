Longitudinal growth of the axial and appendicular skeleton is a result of endochondral ossification (EO) that is controlled by the cartilage growth plate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. EO involves the aggregation of mesenchymal cells to form cartilaginous nodules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. A subset of the cells in these nodules matures further into growth plate chondrocytes.</p><p>During endochondral bone development in the limb, growth plate chondrocytes undergo well-ordered and controlled phases of cell proliferation, maturation, and apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The growth plate can be divided into three main chondrocyte subpopulations: the resting, proliferating and hypertrophic chondrocytes. These populations are arranged in distinct zones that are distinguishable by morphological criteria, but are also characterized by specific molecular markers. The proliferation and/or differentiation of these subpopulations are controlled by a complex network of regulatory molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Proliferative chondrocytes synthesize type II collagen and form characteristic columns; they then exit the cell cycle and become post-mitotic prehypertrophic chondrocytes that differentiate further into hypertrophic cells. Hypertrophic chondrocytes express type X collagen and mineralize the surrounding matrix. This differentiation process is followed by apoptosis of hypertrophic chondrocytes, but prior to their death, they deposit vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) into their extracellular matrix, which promotes the invasion of blood vessels into the cartilage tissue. Blood vessel invasion enables the recruitment of osteoblasts and osteoclasts and replacement of the cartilage scaffold by a calcified bone matrix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. This final step results in the formation of trabecular bone (the primary spongiosa). With continuing resorption of the primary spongiosa by osteoclasts, the primary center splits into two opposing growth plates, in each of which the maturation of cartilage and subsequent remodeling into bone continue, as long as new chondrocytes are generated in the growth plates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Hypertrophic chondrocytes play a pivotal role in coordinating chondrogenesis and osteogenesis, as they provide a scaffold for subsequent formation of trabecular bone and secrete factors such as VEGF that control the activity of other cells involved in EO. Therefore, the proper regulation of chondrocyte differentiation and the coordination of chondrocyte progression through the cell cycle have to be tightly regulated for normal bone growth. The induction of growth arrest is a central feature of this phenotypic transition. For example, mice lacking the cyclin dependent-kinase inhibitor p57/Kip2 exhibit several developmental abnormalities including abnormal skeletogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Moreover, numerous skeletal diseases are caused by deregulation of cellular proliferation and hypertrophic chondrocyte differentiation, such as a large number of skeletal dysplasias that are characterized by dwarfism, skeletal deformities, and frequently by early-onset osteoarthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>Both local paracrine regulators and systemic hormones control endochondral bone formation and bone remodeling throughout life. Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF1) and C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) are among the major stimulators of endochondral bone growth. IGF1 is the most prominent growth factor involved in linear growth regulation and it was shown to be essential for growth plate chondrocyte development. The most prominent effect of IGF1 is induction of chondrocyte hypertrophy, as shown both in IGF1 null mice and in bone cultures treated with IGF1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In addition, studies from our lab and others identified the CNP pathway as an important anabolic regulator of endochondral bone growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. However, the molecular and cellular mechanisms mediating the anabolic effects of both ligands are not completely understood. Substantial progress has been made in the past few years in understanding how local signaling molecules, working through key transcription factors such as Sox and Runx proteins, interact and control the growth and differentiation of bones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. However, the intracellular signaling pathways connecting extracellular signaling molecules to transcriptional regulators are poorly understood.</p><p>Here we focus on Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinases (PI3Ks) which represent a family of lipid kinases whose inositol lipid products are key mediators of intracellular signaling in many cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. PI3Ks are represented by a family of eight distinct enzymes that can be divided into three classes based on their structure and function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Class I PI3Ks have been the major focus of PI3K studies because these isoforms are generally coupled to extracellular stimuli. The generation of D3-phosphorylated phosphoinositides at the membrane by PI3Ks results in the recruitment of certain signaling proteins to the plasma membrane via their pleckstrin homology (PH) domains. As such, PI3Ks are upstream regulators in a number of signaling cascades that control proliferation, growth, cell death, migration, metabolism, and a host of other biological responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. In addition, the PI3K pathway is known as the major signaling cascade downstream IGF1 in many cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>Class I PI3Ks are reversibly inhibited by the pharmacological compound LY294002, and more specifically class I alpha isoforms by PI3-K &#x003b1; inhibitor IV from Calbiochem. Genetic screens in model organisms have identified Akt (protein kinase B) as the primary downstream mediator of the effects of PI3K [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. PtdIns (4, 5)<italic>P2 </italic>and PtdIns (3, 4, 5)<italic>P3 </italic>bind to the PH domain of Akt, recruiting the kinase to the plasma membrane where Akt is phosphorylated and activated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Akt has been shown to be a critical mediator of cell proliferation and survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. In mice, disruption of the most ubiquitously expressed member of the <italic>Akt </italic>family of genes, <italic>Akt1</italic>, results in body size reduction compared to the wild-type littermates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].</p><p>Therefore, the PI3K/Akt pathway is involved in proliferation, differentiation, cellular survival or a combination of these processes in multiple cell types, from neurons to fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] but its role in cartilage and bone development has not been studied intensively and is the focus of our study.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>LY294002 suppresses chondrocyte differentiation</title><p>Micromass cultures were incubated in medium for three days to allow chondrogenic differentiation before addition of the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 (10 &#x003bc;M) or DMSO (Dimethyl Sulfoxide, control) for up to 9 more days (e.g. until 12 days of culture). PI3K inhibition caused a delay in chondrocyte differentiation, as shown by decreased accumulation of sulfated glycosaminoglycans (Alcian blue stain), decreased mineralization (Alizarin red S) and less staining for alkaline phosphatase activity compared to cells treated with DMSO (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>).

Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that in control cultures, phosphorylated Akt (P-Akt) proteins (indicating activity of the pathway) can be found mostly in the late proliferative, prehypertrophic and early hypertrophic areas (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). P-Akt levels were greatly reduced upon PI3K inhibition, demonstrating the efficiency of the inhibitor.

IGF1 treatment caused a significant increase in bone growth (around 70%) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). As before, LY294002 treatment resulted in more than 45% reduction in growth. However, IGF1 stimulated bone growth to a similar degree in LY294002 treated bones (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>), with the ratio between the bone growth in the IGF1 treatment and control (1.73) being lower that the ratio between the LY294002+IGF1 treatment and LY294002 (2.67). There is no significant difference between the control and LY294002+IGF1 treatment. This suggests that in addition to PI3K, another pathway is required for IGF1-induced bone growth.

Similarly to IGF1, CNP induces an enlargement of the hypertrophic zone but in this situation it seems to be dependent on PI3K activity, as shown by reduction of the hypertrophic zone length in the CNP+LY294002 treatment almost to the level of the LY294002 treatment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p><bold>CNP-induced bone growth requires PI3K activity</bold>.

It also stimulates differentiation of CD4+ T-cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] and development and proliferation of B cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. We hypothesized that the PI3K pathway has similar effects in the growth plate, promoting endochondral bone growth by increasing proliferation and differentiation of chondrocytes and by suppressing apoptosis.</p><p>We found that inhibition of PI3K with LY294002 results in decreased differentiation, in both primary chondrocytes (micromass cultures) and organ cultures. Markers of both early chondrocyte differentiation such as collagen II and glycosaminoglycans and of late hypertrophic differentiation such as collagen X, p57, Alkaline phosphatase activity and calcium content (Alizarin red S stain) were decreased upon PI3K inhibition. These data suggest that the PI3K pathway is required for normal chondrocyte differentiation. In the organ culture system, we have shown that the PI3K pathway is required for maximal bone growth, since by inhibiting the pathway we obtained 55% reduction in bone growth, due to a proportionate shortening of both growth plates.</p><p>The major phenotype of the LY294002 treated tibiae is represented by a 45% reduction in the length of the hypertrophic zone, providing further evidence that the PI3K pathway is required for hypertrophic differentiation. The observed reduction in the area staining for collagen X and p57 in LY294002 treated tibiae is in agreement with reduced hypertrophy. In addition we have seen a 20% reduction of the length of the proliferative area of the growth plate, in LY294002 treated tibiae. In the organ culture system it seems that the onset of proliferation is delayed, since the resting zone represents a higher percentage of the growth plate in the LY294002 treated bones compared to control. The ratio of BrdU labeled cells within the proliferative zone of the growth plate does not appear to be different between LY294002 and control cultures, suggesting that PI3K inhibition results in delayed cell cycle entry, but does not affect the rate of cell cycle progression once cells have entered to proliferative zone. Our data also show increased apoptosis in organ cultures treated with LY294002. Apoptosis was only detected in the hypertrophic and mineralized zones, suggesting that the PI3K pathway is required for hypertrophic chondrocyte survival.</p><p>PI3K signaling transduces signals from many growth factors and other extracellular cues, but it is not known which of them utilizes the pathway for anabolic effects on endochondral bones. Potential candidates are IGFs, however, our data suggest, somewhat unexpectedly that IGF1 stimulates organ culture growth in the presence of LY294002 to a similar degree as in control cultures. IGF1 treatment causes an increase in the length of hypertrophic zone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], and this increase is not completely blocked by the PI3K inhibitor. This suggests that the PI3K pathway is not the only and potentially not the major pathway required for IGF1-induced bone growth and -hypertrophic differentiation in our organ culture system.</p><p>One potential problem that could partially explain the lack of growth reduction in the IGF1 + LY294002 treatment is that IGF1 possibly increased Akt phosphorylation to a level that is no longer completely inhibited by 10 &#x003bc;M LY294002. The mechanisms for IGF1 and CNP regulation of the PI3K pathway in growth plate chondrocytes are not the focus of this manuscript, but we plan to investigate the implications of these two growth factors in more depth in future studies. It will be important to see the levels of phosphorylated Akt in all treatment combinations, by performing immunohistochemistry and Western blotting with protein isolated directly from the tibiae treated with all treatment combinations (control, IGF1, LY294002 and LY294002 + IGF1 or control, CNP, LY294002, and CNP +LY294002). In addition, future measurements of growth plate zones under all conditions might provide an explanation for the sustained anabolic effects of IGF1even in the presence of LY294002. Our results have shown that the PI3K pathway is mostly involved in hypertrophic chondrocyte differentiation, and also that the two ligands IGF1 and CNP increase the length of hypertrophic zone (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>). There were no obvious effects on the other zones, but performing growth plate zone measurements and molecular analyses (e.g. BrdU labeling) might bring additional information in the future.</p><p>It will also be of interest to determine which other pathways mediate anabolic activities of IGFs in cartilage; the other major signaling pathway implicated in IGF signaling in other cells, the MEK-ERK (mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase/extracellular regulated kinase) cascade, has been shown to suppress endochondral bone growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>] and is therefore an unlikely candidate for this role.</p><p>Surprisingly, C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP), which is not a known PI3K activator, was found to partially require PI3K activity to stimulate bone growth. The CNP-induced growth of cultured tibiae was blocked by the PI3K inhibitor. One interesting finding was that the effect of CNP on hypertrophy &#x02013; a significant increase in the hypertrophic zone length [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] &#x02013; was inhibited by LY294002. These data identify CNP as one signal requiring PI3K activity in cartilage, but there are other potential candidates for regulation of the PI3K pathway in endochondral bone growth, such as PTHrP (Parathyroid hormone-related protein) and integrin ligands. Studies are under way in our laboratory to identify physiological activators of PI3K signaling in cartilage.</p><p>The molecular mechanisms mediating the effects of PI3K signaling in endochondral bone growth remain to be identified. We show that Akt proteins are phosphorylated under control conditions, and that this activation is reduced under PI3K inhibition, resulting in reduced bone growth, in agreement with reduced growth in <italic>Akt1</italic>-deficient mice as well as mice deficient in multiple <italic>Akt </italic>genes[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. The PI3K/Akt pathway was shown to be involved in Runx2 (runt related transcription factor 2) -dependent osteoblast and chondrocyte differentiation in 2 cell lines, MC3T3-E1 and ATCDC5, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Therefore it represents a candidate for the PI3K involvement in chondrocyte hypertrophy. Further investigations of the PI3K/Akt mechanisms of chondrocyte differentiation are necessary in order to find the direct targets of this signaling pathway.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have shown that PI3K is required for normal growth plate chondrocyte differentiation and survival in vitro, and therefore for endochondral bone growth. Future studies are required to further analyze the mechanisms by which PI3K exerts these effects, investigating both the molecules downstream of PI3K and the upstream activators of the pathway, and the mechanisms used by these molecules in order to function within the PI3K/Akt pathway.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title><p>Timed pregnant CD1 mice were purchased from Charles River Laboratories.
