In this study, we show that neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) deficiency in mice causes strikingly increased sensitivity to LT, while deficiencies in the two other NOS enzymes (iNOS and eNOS) have no effect on LT-mediated mortality. The increased sensitivity of nNOS&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice was independent of macrophage sensitivity to toxin, or cytokine responses, and could be replicated in nNOS-sufficient wild-type (WT) mice through pharmacological inhibition of the enzyme with 7-nitroindazole. Histopathological analyses showed that LT induced architectural changes in heart morphology of nNOS&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice, with rapid appearance of novel inter-fiber spaces but no associated apoptosis of cardiomyocytes. LT-treated WT mice had no histopathology observed at the light microscopy level. Electron microscopic analyses of LT-treated mice, however, revealed striking pathological changes in the hearts of both nNOS&#x02212;/&#x02212; and WT mice, varying only in severity and timing. Endothelial/capillary necrosis and degeneration, inter-myocyte edema, myofilament and mitochondrial degeneration, and altered sarcoplasmic reticulum cisternae were observed in both LT-treated WT and nNOS&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice. Furthermore, multiple biomarkers of cardiac injury (myoglobin, cardiac troponin-I, and heart fatty acid binding protein) were elevated in LT-treated mice very rapidly (by 6 h after LT injection) and reached concentrations rarely reported in mice. Cardiac protective nitrite therapy and allopurinol therapy did not have beneficial effects in LT-treated mice. Surprisingly, the potent nitric oxide scavenger, carboxy-PTIO, showed some protective effect against LT. Echocardiography on LT-treated mice indicated an average reduction in ejection fraction following LT treatment in both nNOS&#x02212;/&#x02212; and WT mice, indicative of decreased contractile function in the heart. We report the heart as an early target of LT in mice and discuss a protective role for nNOS against LT-mediated cardiac damage.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Injection of pure anthrax lethal toxin (LT) at the levels found in terminally-ill, anthrax-infected animals induces an atypical vascular collapse in several experimental animals without the associated hemorrhagic manifestations and disseminated intravascular coagulopathies seen in bacteria-induced shock states. Nevertheless, LT alone produces the pleural edema that is a classic manifestation of anthrax. All the histopathological changes previously observed in LT-treated mice can be explained as predictable sequelae of vascular insufficiency. In this report, electron microscopic analysis was used to identify rapid and striking pathological changes in endothelial cells, myocytes, mitochondria, and the sarcoplasmic reticulum cisternae in the hearts of LT-challenged mice. These morphological changes were paralleled by release of very high levels of multiple cardiac injury biomarkers. LT-induced pathological changes occurred earlier and with markedly higher severity in nNOS knockout mice compared to wild-type or iNOS or eNOS knockout mice, reflecting the well-established role of nNOS in maintenance of cardiac function, and suggesting that nitric oxide produced by nNOS counteracts the damage induced by LT.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Anthrax toxin, the major virulence factor of <italic>Bacillus anthracis</italic>, consists of three polypeptides: Edema Factor (EF), Lethal Factor (LF) and Protective Antigen (PA).

This extremely rapid death in rats, which is dependent on PA and transport of LF to the cellular cytoplasm, is accompanied by a rapid accumulation of pleural fluid. Although LF is known to cleave most of the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases (MAPKKs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000456-Duesbery1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000456-Vitale1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, the molecular basis for LT-mediated effects leading to shock in animals is currently unknown.</p><p>Nitric oxide (NO) is one of the most potent modulators of vascular function in vivo and its production by NO synthases is often highly increased during infections. The role of NO in LT- or <italic>Bacillus anthracis</italic>-mediated pathogenesis has been investigated in a number of studies. We previously tested inducible NO synthase (iNOS) knockout mice (iNOS&#x02212;/&#x02212;) for susceptibility to LT and found no difference in LT sensitivity relative to WT controls <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000456-Moayeri1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

While it has been reported that <italic>B. anthracis</italic> infection can induce NO production in macrophages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000456-Raines1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, LT actually has inhibitory effects on NO induction by iNOS through many classic stimuli such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000456-Pellizzari1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. LT itself does not induce NO production in macrophage cell lines or peritoneal macrophages and changes in NO circulatory levels were not detected in LT-treated mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000456-Moayeri1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref> and data not shown).</p><p>The rapid and impressive changes that occur in NO concentrations during bacterial infections are generally attributed to the action of the inducible NO synthase isoform (iNOS). After previous studies did not identify a role for iNOS in LT-mediated effects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000456-Moayeri1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, we chose to extend these studies to examine the role of the constitutive NO synthases in LT-mediated pathogenesis. Knockout mice lacking either endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) or neuronal NO synthase (nNOS) have been useful for delineating the roles of these important enzymes in NO-mediated events. In the current study we report on the increased sensitivity of nNOS&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice to toxin when compared to iNOS&#x02212;/&#x02212; and eNOS&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice, as well as to WT mice, suggesting a protective role for nNOS in LT-mediated pathogenesis.

The iNOS&#x02212;/&#x02212; and eNOS&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice did not show any significant difference in susceptibility to LT compared to their C57BL/6J (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000456-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) or B6.129SF2/J (data not shown) parental controls, with over 50&#x00025; of the animals succumbing by 120 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000456-g001">Figure 1A</xref> and data not shown). However, the nNOS&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice were uniquely sensitive to LT with 50&#x00025; of mice succumbing by 30 h. More than 95&#x00025; of these animals were dead by 48 h after a single challenge of LT (100 &#x000b5;g). At the lower challenge dose of 40 &#x000b5;g, 80&#x00025; of the nNOS&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice died between 50 and 108 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000456-g001">Figure 1B</xref>), while the 30&#x00025; of control animals that succumbed only started doing so at 108 h. In general, malaise symptoms were apparent in toxin-challenged nNOS mice as early as 12 h after injection while control animals rarely showed signs of malaise until 60 h. Thus, nNOS-deficient mice were clearly more sensitive to LT than their wild type counterparts. Treatment with PA alone or PA and enzymatically inactive LF is not lethal to mice (data not shown).</p><fig id="ppat-1000456-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1000456.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>nNOS&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice are more susceptible to LT.</title><p>nNOS&#x02212;/&#x02212;, eNOS&#x02212;/&#x02212;, iNOS&#x02212;/&#x02212;, and C57BL6/J mice were treated with LT ((A) 100 &#x000b5;g IP, or (B) 40 &#x000b5;g IP) and monitored for survival.

Carboxy-PTIO (2-phenyl-4,4,5,5,-tetramethylimidazoline-1-oxyl-3-oxide) is a potent NO scavenger which has no direct effect on NO synthase enzymatic function. We treated WT animals with this drug prior to LT challenge. Surprisingly, instead of exacerbating LT action, carboxy-PTIO treatment of WT animals actually had a significant beneficial effect, prolonging survival of LT-treated mice. Carboxy-PTIO may provide a protective function in a manner independent of its NO scavenging ability, or target NO production by other sources. Thus, NO or other PTIO-scavenged oxidative species produced at various tissue sites (in a manner independent of nNOS) may actually have a detrimental effect in LT pathogenesis. Alternatively, PTIO scavenging of NO may increase activity of other protective enzymes.

Studies on LT-induced shock in toxin-infused rats (which succumb at a slower rate over 24 h) have also shown shock accompanied by hypotension, lactic acidosis and an accumulation of pleural fluid, with no associated histopathological changes, no benefit from fluid therapy, and therefore, in summary, distinct differences from classic cytokine-associated endotoxic shock <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000456-Cui1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000456-Sherer1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000456-Cui3">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>. Assessment of vascular function parameters in LT-treated rats pointed to altered cardiomyocyte function associated with acute heart failure, suggesting that the rapid and striking pulmonary edema occurs as a secondary manifestation of the failing heart <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000456-Kuo1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Specifically, rapid myocardial dysfunction in rats was shown as a reduction of left ventricular systolic function following a single LT bolus injection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000456-Watson1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The dramatic pathological changes seen in the mouse heart following LT treatment in the current study are clearly independent of macrophage sensitivity and cytokine responses since C57BL/6J mice harbor LT-resistant macrophage and have no cytokine responses to LT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000456-Moayeri2">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. These striking effects could be the result of direct targeting of cardiomyocytes or heart endothelium by toxin, or once again secondary to LT effects on other cells controlling peripheral mediators of vasculature homeostasis. The altered architecture and vacuolation of endothelial cells, however, is suggestive of direct LT effects on these cells in the heart. It is important to note that as these LT-induced changes were only observed by electron microscopy, it is possible that LT also affects endothelial cells in many other target organs in a similar manner and even at earlier times. Furthermore, the LT effects reported here are in the context of a bolus toxin injection model, and it is more than likely that <italic>B. anthracis</italic> infections would target numerous organs earlier during the course of disease, before LT levels affecting the heart or endothelium are reached. Nonetheless, the heart damage induced by LT, as measured by rapid and extreme release of cardiac biomarkers, is the earliest currently known <italic>in vivo</italic> effect of this toxin in mice.</p><p>An interesting finding in this work is the clear beneficial effect of nNOS in LT-mediated pathogenesis, while iNOS and eNOS appear to play no role. NO is a key regulator of vascular function, affecting blood pressure and flow regulation, platelet aggregation, and leukocyte adhesion, among others. Although its designation implies preferential expression in neural tissues, nNOS is actually expressed in skeletal muscle, smooth muscle, and the heart, as well as in neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000456-Mungrue1">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref>. However, nNOS-derived NO is believed to primarily manifest its most potent protective effects in the heart (for reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000456-Casadei1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000456-Sears1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000456-Lim1">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000456-Loyer2">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref>) and it is possible that the protective effects of this enzyme after LT treatment are also based on its function in the heart. All effects of the NO in the heart are localized paracrine effects dependent on the location of eNOS and nNOS (the two constitutive enzymes in the heart). This is because of the high content of myoglobin in the heart, which acts as a quencher of NO and thus does not allow this normally highly diffusible molecule to function at distances in the heart. In the heart eNOS is associated with the caveolae <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000456-Barouch1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000456-Feron1">&#x0005b;57&#x0005d;</xref> and nNOS is normally in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) in close association with ryanodine receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000456-Barouch1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000456-Xu1">&#x0005b;58&#x0005d;</xref> and XOR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000456-Kinugawa1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000456-Khan2">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. nNOS-derived NO mediates cardiomyocyte contraction through its effects on the SR Ca<sup>&#x0002b;2</sup> cycle that is central to excitation-contraction coupling and modulation of ryanodine receptor function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000456-Sears1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000456-Sears2">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000456-Khan1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000456-Seddon1">&#x0005b;59&#x0005d;</xref>.

We found, however, that inhibition of XOR had a detrimental effect on survival of LT-treated WT mice. Interestingly, XOR inhibition with allopurinol was also unable to reverse the increased susceptibility of nNOS&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice to this toxin (data not shown) indicating that nNOS was unlikely to be manifesting its protective functions through reversing XOR-produced effects.</p><p>Multiple explanations can be offered for the protective role of nNOS against LT. Perhaps the simpler view is that nNOS deficiency results in an imbalance between oxidative stress and NO signaling such that the ROS status of the heart leaves it more susceptible to LT-induced damage. Alternatively, nNOS-derived NO could be acting to maintain normal cardiomyocyte function, which serves to counteract the toxin's deleterious effects on cardiomyocytes or the peripheral vasculature. In the absence of nNOS, animals cannot respond as well to LT-mediated cardiac dysfunction, much as has been noted for other cardiac injury models. In fact, during cardiac stress or heart failure nNOS has been shown to translocate to the sarcolemma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000456-Damy1">&#x0005b;60&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000456-Bendall1">&#x0005b;62&#x0005d;</xref> and this relocalization of nNOS results in a decreased ability to control contractility via ryanodine receptor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000456-Loyer1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000456-Sears1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000456-Lim1">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref>. nNOS and its activity are upregulated and protective in heart failure.

It is important to note that despite the shown LT effects on heart function in LT-sensitive rats, the potent 7-NI nNOS inhibitor was unable to sensitize LT-resistant Lewis rats at multiple doses (data not shown), indicating a genetic-based resistance in rats that differed from the sensitization seen in mice.</p><p>nNOS-derived NO may also provide a protective function against LT through its control of mitochondrial respiration. Mitochondrial degeneration was seen in response to LT in mouse hearts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000456-g004">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000456-g006">Figure 6</xref>).

Clearly nNOS may provide protection against LT at multiple tissue sites or due to effects in vasculature in all organs.</p><p>The molecular mechanism(s) by which LT induces the rapid pathological changes described in this report and the associated rapid release of cardiac biomarkers (in &#x0003c; 6 h) is unknown. These are the earliest events yet observed in C57BL/6J mice in response to LT treatment in the bolus challenge model. The direct inactivation of key MAPK pathways by the lethal factor protease may initiate these events. Activation of the MEK1/2 pathway is considered a protective response in the heart and has been clearly linked to cardiac hypertrophy in many independent studies, including those where overexpression of activated MEK1 in transgenic mice results in dramatic increases in cardiac contractile performance (for review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000456-Bueno1">&#x0005b;74&#x0005d;</xref>).

With the known strong links between MEK1/2 activation and cardioprotection, it would be interesting to know whether cleavage and inactivation of MEK1/2 by LT in the heart leads directly to a loss of nNOS function. Interestingly, there are several examples of acute myocarditis and sudden death as a result of rapid proteolytic cleavage events in the heart caused by infectious agents. Coxsackie virus destroys cardiomyocytes when its protease 2A cleaves dystrophin in these cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000456-Badorff1">&#x0005b;76&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000456-Knowlton1">&#x0005b;77&#x0005d;</xref> and cardiac NO actually protects against this cleavage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000456-Badorff2">&#x0005b;78&#x0005d;</xref>.

Thus anthrax toxin is still considered the major relevant virulence factor for this disease and understanding the mechanisms by which LT causes mortality and vascular insufficiency can aid in unraveling the mystery of how this disease kills. We believe the LT-mediated cardiopathology described here is a step toward a better understanding of this toxin's effects in vivo. Our future studies will focus on deciphering the role the cleavage and inactivation of MEK proteins may or may not play in LT-induced cardiomyopathy, the molecular mechanism of LT-induced early cardiac damage, the means by which nNOS-derived NO is protective against LT effects and the tissue sites at which nNOS manifests these effects.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Materials</title><p>LF and PA were purified from <italic>B. anthracis</italic> as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000456-Varughese1">&#x0005b;80&#x0005d;</xref>.
