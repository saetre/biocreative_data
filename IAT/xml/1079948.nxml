A nuclease protection assay showed prominent levels of &#x003b1;7 in the NCI-H82 SCLC cell line while &#x003b1;7 was not detected in SAEC, suggesting that &#x003b1;7 mRNA levels may be higher in SCLC compared to normal cells.

Binding of agonists to this receptor activates the release of the autocrine growth factor serotonin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In addition, we have shown that the nicotine-derived carcinogenic nitrosamine, 4(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK), is a high affinity agonist for the &#x003b1;7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (&#x003b1;7 nAChR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Binding of NNK to this receptor caused an influx of Ca<sup>2+ </sup>from the extracellular environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], resulting in the activation of a protein kinase C-dependent Raf-1/MAP kinase-mediated mitogenic pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. These findings suggest that the chronic stimulation of this pathway may contribute to the selective development of this histologic cancer type in smokers. Accordingly, components of this signal transduction pathway may be promising targets for cancer intervention studies with selectivity for SCLC.</p><p>Our goal in the present studies was to determine the extent of &#x003b1;7 mRNA expression in the human lung to determine if previous research with SCLC could be extrapolated to other lung malignancies. Previous research in our laboratory indicated expression of mRNA for the &#x003b1;7 receptor in normal fetal hamster PNEC cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. PNEC cells are one of the possible cells of origin for SCLC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. We screened multiple small cell and non-small cell lung cancer cell lines, normal cells, and fresh surgical tissue samples from cancer patients for mRNA expression of the &#x003b1;7 receptor. With the exception of NCI-H441 cell line, all cell lines and patient samples tested expressed mRNA for the &#x003b1;7 receptor, and the &#x003b1;7 nicotinic receptor protein is expressed in fewer cell lines.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>The human SCLC cell lines NCI-H69, NCI-H82, NCI-H146, NCI-H187, NCI-H209, and NCI-H526, the human adenocarcinoma cell lines NCI-H322 and NCI-H441, and A549, the carcinoid cell line NCI-H727, and the squamous cell lines NCI-H226, NCI-H2170, and NCI-H520 were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA). The human SCLC cell line WBA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] was a gift of Dr. G. Krystal, Medical College of Virginia. All cancer cell lines except A549 were maintained in RPMI medium supplemented with fetal bovine serum (10% v/v), L-glutamine (2 mM), penicillin (100 U/ml) and streptomycin (100 &#x003bc;g/ml) at 37&#x000b0;C in an atmosphere of 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. A549 cells were grown in Hams F12 media with supplements as above. Human small airway epithelia cells (SAEC) were purchased from Clonetics/BioWhittaker (Walkersville, MD). These cells were maintained in SAEC basal medium with supplements (Clonetics) at 37&#x000b0;C in an atmosphere of 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Fresh surgical tissue samples were collected from patients at the University of Tennessee Graduate School of Medicine's Cancer Center and processed for reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The collection of tissue was approved by the University of Tennessee Institutional Review Board, and the authors have been certified by the NIH Office of Human Subjects Research.</p></sec><sec><title>RT-PCR</title><p>RT-PCR assays were conducted with all cells and tissues. Expression of the &#x003b1;7 receptor by RT-PCR in fetal hamster PNECs has been previously published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. RT-PCR was done as described before [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] except new human &#x003b1;7 primers (forward 5'-gccaatgactcgcaaccactc-3' and reverse 5'-ccagcgtacatcgatgtagca-3' bases 236&#x02013;571, Genbank accession number X70297) were used. These amplified a 335 bp fragment. Oligonucleotide primers were acquired from Life Technologies (Grand Island, NY). These primer pairs are in areas of the sequence that are homologous between humans, rats, and chick brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Reactions were run on a MJ Research PTC-200 thermal cycler (Watertown, MA) with the following conditions: 1 cycle of 2 min. at 94&#x000b0;C, 40 cycles of 94&#x000b0;C, 30 sec; 55&#x000b0;C, 30 sec; 72&#x000b0;C, 45 sec, with a final extension for 5 min. at 72&#x000b0;C.</p></sec><sec><title>Sequencing</title><p>Several PCR products were sequenced to verify the integrity of the PCR process. The NCI-H69, NCI-H322, and SAE cells were sequenced using the forward PCR primer for human &#x003b1;7. Sequencing was done with the ABI Terminator Cycle Sequencing reaction kit on an ABI 373 DNA sequencer (Perkin-Elmer, Foster City, CA).</p></sec><sec><title>Nuclease-protection assay</title><p>The nuclease protection assay was used to determine differences in expression levels in a representative SCLC cell line (NCI-H82), and in SAE cells. The Lig'nScribe kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) was used to add a T7 RNA polymerase promoter to the PCR fragment amplified by the gene specific &#x003b1;7 primer, and then this T7-&#x003b1;7 fragment was PCR amplified, and the resulting fragment was used directly in a transcription reaction using the MAXIscript in vitro transcription kit (Ambion). This transcription reaction consisted of the PCR fragment, 10X transcription buffer, 10 mM ATP, UTP and GTP, T7 polymerase, [&#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P] CTP (800 Ci/mmol, Dupont-NEN, Boston, MA), and nuclease free water to a final volume of 20 &#x003bc;l. A probe for 28S ribosomal RNA was also transcribed and used as an internal control. These reactions were incubated for 1 hour at 37&#x000b0;C. After this incubation, 1 &#x003bc;l of DNase I was added, and the mixture was further incubated for 15 min. at 37&#x000b0;C. The probes were gel purified.</p><p>The RPA III kit (Ambion) was used. A molar excess of labeled probes (28S and gene specific) were added to 20 &#x003bc;g total RNA or Yeast RNA (Ambion), and the RNA samples and probes were co-precipitated and resuspended in hybridization buffer. After incubation at 95&#x000b0;C for 4 min., and incubation overnight at 42&#x000b0;C, RNase digestion buffer containing RNase A/RNase T1 was added. After digestion for 30 min. at 37&#x000b0;C, RNase inactivation/precipitation solution was added. After precipitation the pellets were resuspended in gel loading buffer, heated at 95&#x000b0;C for 4 min. and loaded onto a 5% polyacrylamide, 8 M urea gel (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). In addition RNA Century Markers Plus templates (Ambion) were transcribed and used as markers. After electrophoresis, the gel was transferred to blotting paper, dried, and exposed to Kodak XAR film.</p></sec><sec><title>Western blots</title><p>Cell pellets were collected and membrane protein was isolated with the ReadyPrep protein extraction kit (signal) (Biorad). Protein levels were determined using the RCDC kit (Biorad). Aliquots of 20&#x02013;30 &#x003bc;g protein were boiled in 3x loading buffer (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) for 2 minutes, then loaded onto 12% Tris-glycine-polyacrylamide gels (Cambrex, Rockland, ME), and transferred electrophoretically to nictrocellulose membranes. Membranes were incubated with the primary antibody (alpha 7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor; Abcam, Cambridge, MA). In all western blots, membranes were additionally probed with an antibody for actin (Sigma) to ensure equal loading of protein between samples. The membranes were then incubated with appropriate secondary antibodies (Rockland, Gilbertsville, PA or Molecular Probes, Eugene OR). The antibody-protein complexes were detected by the LiCor Odyssey infrared imaging system (Lincoln, NE). Cells for some blots were incubated with 100 pM NNK (Midwest Research Institute, Kansas City, MO) for various times.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The RT-PCR assay demonstrated expression of the &#x003b1;7 nAChR in all seven cultured human SCLC cell lines (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) and in SAE cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).

With the exception of the NCI-H441 adenocarcinoma cell line, the &#x003b1;7 nAChR mRNA was expressed in all normal and cancer cells tested. Previous research in our laboratory indicated expression of mRNA for the &#x003b1;7 receptor in normal fetal hamster PNEC cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. PNEC cells are one of the possible cells of origin for SCLC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The expression of the &#x003b1;7 nAChR is not an artifact of cell culture since the expression of the &#x003b1;7 nAChR was seen in nine tumor samples from different patients with lung cancer. We also found that the &#x003b1;7 nAChR is expressed in five distinct types of cancer: squamous, carcinoid, adenocarcinoma, large cell carcinoma, and small cell lung cancer. This is the first report of the expression of the &#x003b1;7 nAChR receptor mRNA in pulmonary squamous, carcinoids or large cell carcinomas. A recent report indicated &#x003b1;7 nAChR receptor mRNA in both human bronchial epithelial cells and airway fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], supporting the hypothesis of ubiquitous expression of the &#x003b1;7 nAChR receptor mRNA in human lung cells.</p><p>In addition, we have demonstrated expression of the &#x003b1;7 nAChR protein of the correct molecular weight in lung cancer cells for the first time. Of the seven SCLC cell lines tested for the &#x003b1;7 nAChR mRNA expression, only the NCI-H187 cell line did not express a band of the correct molecular weight for the &#x003b1;7 nAChR. In the non-SCLC cells and normal cells that express the &#x003b1;7 nAChR mRNA, &#x003b1;7 nAChR protein expression was more limited than in SCLC. SAEC (normal cells), the adenocarcinoma cell line A549 and the squamous cell line NCI-H226 express protein for &#x003b1;7, whereas the adenocarcinoma cell line NCI-H322, the carcinoid cell line NCI-H727, the squamous cell lines NCI-H520 and NCI-H2170 did not express protein for &#x003b1;7. However, our data are in contrast to another recent study. Carlisle et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] found that &#x003b1;7 nAChR transcripts are frequently found in human bronchial epithelial cells although the protein of the correct size is not. They also postulated that muscle-type nicotinic acetylcholine receptors might be involved in responses to nicotine. Further research is needed to determine if both neuronal and muscle type acetylcholine receptors are involved in signaling events in lung cancer cells.</p><p>Previous research from our laboratories has indicated that NNK binds with high affinity to alpha-bungarotoxin (agonist for &#x003b1;7 and &#x003b1;8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]) sensitive nAChRs in NCI-H69 and NCI-H82 cells, and the NNK affinity for these receptors was several times higher than for nicotine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. This binding was inhibited by hexamethonium but not decamethonium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Hexamethonium is a selective agonist for neuronal nAChRs, whereas decamethonium is selective for muscle-type nAChRs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. In addition, we have found that NNK activates the Raf-1/MAP kinase pathway resulting in phosphorylation of c-myc [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. This activation was inhibited by alpha-bungarotoxin. Lending support to this data, in the present study NNK stimulated &#x003b1;7 protein expression in NCI-H69 cells. Although muscle type acetylcholine receptors may be involved in signaling responses in SCLC, our data indicates the &#x003b1;7 neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor is a functional receptor in lung cells and stimulates signaling events in these cells.</p><p>Using a nuclease protection assay that allows for direct comparisons between samples, we found higher levels of &#x003b1;7 nAChR mRNA receptor in NCI-H82 than in SAEC. The RT-PCR assay showing expression of &#x003b1;7 nAChR receptor in SAE cells is a much more sensitive assay, but does not allow for the comparisons seen in the nuclease protection assay. The increase in &#x003b1;7 nAChR receptor in the SCLC cell line NCI-H82 compared to the normal SAE cells from a non-smoker is consistent with other data from our laboratory and others. In addition, it has been shown that the NCI-H82 cell line synthesized the highest levels of acetylcholine, and addition of nicotinic antagonists slowed growth of the NCI-H82 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Acetylcholine is known to act as an autocrine growth factor for SCLC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. This data is also consistent with protein levels of the &#x003b1;7 nAChR. The NCI-H82 cell line had the highest level of &#x003b1;7 nAChR protein of the SCLC cell lines tested.</p><p>Treatment of pregnant hamsters with the tobacco carcinogen, NNK, led to an increase in the &#x003b1;7 nAChR in PNEC isolated from fetal hamsters on the 15<sup>th </sup>day of gestation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. As indicated above, previous data from our laboratory has also shown that an associated mitogenic signal transduction pathway is upregulated in SCLC. Similar results were seen in the hamster PNEC model, as protein levels of Raf-1 in NNK treated hamster PNEC were greatly increased compared to control PNEC protein levels, and the NNK treated PNEC protein levels were at similar levels to untreated SCLC cell line NCI-H69 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In addition, ERK1/2 protein levels were also increased in NNK treated PNEC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. These findings are in accord with publications which have demonstrated that chronic exposure of brain cells to nicotinic agonists results in a paradoxical upregulation of this receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Our findings are also supported by a study in monkeys, which has shown that chronic treatment of pregnant monkeys with nicotine caused a pronounced upregulation of the &#x003b1;7 nAChR in the lungs of the newborns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Together these data indicate that the &#x003b1;7 nAChR may play an important role in the development of SCLC, and other lung cancers in which smoking is involved. Although there are many growth factors involved in multiple pathways leading to lung cancer, the effects of signaling through nicotinic receptors needs further investigation to determine its role in the pathogenesis of lung cancer. Further studies with lung cancer cell lines that express both the mRNA and protein for the &#x003b1;7 nAChR are needed.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Expression of mRNA for the neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor &#x003b1;7 seems to be ubiquitously expressed in all human lung cancer cell lines tested (except for NCI-H441) as well as normal lung cells. The &#x003b1;7 nicotinic receptor protein is expressed in fewer cell lines, and the tobacco carcinogen NNK increases &#x003b1;7 nicotinic receptor protein levels. The &#x003b1;7 nAChR may play an important role in the development of SCLC and other lung cancers in which smoking is involved.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>HP carried out all experiments with the exception of the western blots, participated in the design of the study, and helped draft the manuscript.
