Whereas FPA and FPB contain a CRE-like sequence, the FPC sequence is not related to any known protein recognition sequences, yet all three domains are required to mediate cAMP action on a heterologous promoter. To study the functional cooperation among these three domains we purified and cloned a FPC-binding protein (FPCB) from porcine kidney derived LLC-PK1 cells. Sequence comparisons showed that FPCB is homologous to mouse LFB3 and rat vHNF1. LFB3/vHNF1 is related to a liver specific transcription factor HNF1, it recognizes the same sequence as HNF1 and is highly expressed in kidney cells. FPCB and HNF1 recognition sequences are dissimilar, nevertheless both sequences are recognized by in vitro-translated LFB3 and FPCB, indicating that binding to the two different sequences is an intrinsic character of FPCB/LFB3/vHNF1. In HeLa cells, this cAMP-responsive site was inactive whether FPCB was overexpressed or not, suggesting a requirement for an additional cell-specific factor. These results may suggest a mechanism by which hormonal control is integrated into cell-specific gene regulation.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00057-0165-a" xlink:role="1848"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00057-0166-a" xlink:role="1849"/></fig><fig id="F3"><graphic xlink:href="nar00057-0166-b" xlink:role="1849"/></fig><fig id="F4"><graphic xlink:href="nar00057-0167-a" xlink:role="1850"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00057-0162.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1845"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00057-0163.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1846"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00057-0164.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1847"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00057-0165.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1848"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00057-0166.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1849"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00057-0167.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1850"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00057-0168.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1851"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00057-0169.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1852"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
