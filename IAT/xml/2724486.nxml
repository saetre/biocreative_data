To begin development, oocytes must undergo a number of changes that are collectively called egg activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The egg is hydrated, proteins in its vitelline membrane undergo cross-linking, certain maternal RNAs are polyadenylated and translated while others are degraded [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], the phosphorylation state of many proteins changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], the cortical actin cytoskeleton is reorganized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], and meiosis resumes. Egg activation in <italic>Drosophila </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] and other insects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], is independent of fertilization (in contrast to the situation in other animals) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]; it is triggered instead by passage through the female's reproductive tract. Despite differences in trigger, the initial cause of egg activation in essentially all animals appears to be an increase in intracellular calcium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Upon activation, <italic>Drosophila </italic>oocytes complete meiosis rapidly without cytokinesis, resulting in four haploid nuclei located near the membrane and aligned perpendicular to the long axis of the egg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The chromosomes of all four meiotic products decondense and appear morphologically to be in a state similar to interphase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. In unfertilized, activated eggs, all four meiotic products synchronously replicate their DNA once, and then condense their chromosomes ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], B. Loppin personal communication). The four nuclei then associate into a single composite polar body, which appears as a rosette-shaped array of condensed chromosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>In fertilized eggs, the innermost meiotic product (the nucleus furthest from the egg cortex) usually becomes the maternal pronucleus and remains decondensed, while the remaining three meiotic products associate into a polar body near the surface of the egg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The sperm nucleus undergoes reorganization to become the paternal pronucleus. Its chromatin decondenses and recruits maternally provided proteins, such as YA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The maternal and paternal pronuclei migrate towards each other and closely appose (align next to each other) for the first mitotic division. This migration requires microtubules nucleated at the male pronucleus and microtubule associated proteins such as Ncd (non-claret disjunctional), KLP3A (kinesin-like protein at 3A), and Asp (abnormal spindle protein) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. The first S phase of all the five haploid nuclei in embryos likely occurs just prior to or concurrent with apposition, as assessed by staining with the S-phase marker PCNA (Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The two pronuclear genomes subsequently divide on a shared spindle, but because remnants of the nuclear envelope remain around the pronuclei, the parental genomes remain separate through anaphase; this unusual first mitosis is called the "gonomeric" division.</p><p>Chromosomes derived from the male and female pronuclei finally mix together during telophase of the gonomeric division, resulting in two diploid zygotic nuclei [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. These zygotic nuclei then undergo thirteen rapid mitotic divisions without cytokinesis. During these cycles, S and M phases are normally tightly coupled. However, mutation of any of three maternal effect genes <italic>plutonium (plu), giant nuclei (gnu)</italic>, and <italic>pan gu (png) </italic>results in repeated rounds of replication (S phase) without mitosis, resulting in giant nuclei [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. These three genes and <italic>fs(1)Ya </italic>appear to function specifically at this unique cell cycle transition from meiosis to mitosis, having no known functions in any adult tissues or other stages of development.</p><p>The embryos produced by females homozygous for null or strong hypomorphic mutations of the gene <italic>fs(1)Ya </italic>fail to initiate the first embryonic mitosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. YA, the product of this gene, is a novel protein with a developmentally regulated subcellular localization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. In oocytes, YA is cytoplasmic, but in early embryos or in activated eggs that are not fertilized, YA localizes to the nuclear lamina and nucleoplasm, where it associates with lamin, DNA, and histone H2B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. The nuclear lamina is the proteinaceous inner layer of the nuclear envelope that provides structure to the nucleus, organizes the chromatin and provides nucleation sites for chromosome condensation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. In this paper, we analyze in detail the developmental arrest that occurs in embryos deficient for YA (hereafter called <italic>Ya</italic><sup>2 </sup>embryos), in an effort to understand which events in early development depend upon YA. We show that YA function is not required for egg activation, but rather immediately thereafter for the transition from meiosis to mitosis. We find that meiotic segregation occurs normally in <italic>Ya</italic><sup>2 </sup>eggs and embryos, and that the resultant nuclei can afterwards enter S phase. However, without YA function, female meiotic products undergo inappropriate associations with one another and with the male pronucleus. These nuclei appear to have variable chromatin condensation states, particularly as seen in asynchronies in the phosphorylation state of histone H3 and localization of PCNA. Our data suggest that YA protein function is required for early embryos to transit a control point between post-meiotic DNA replication and the initiation of the first mitotic division.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Drosophila strains</title><p>The null allele <italic>fs(1)Ya</italic><sup>2 </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] was carried in stock as <italic>X^X</italic>, <italic>y<sup>2</sup> fs(1)Ya<sup>2</sup> w<sup>bf</sup> spl sn<sup>3</sup>/Y, y<sup>+</sup> fs(1)Ya<sup>+</sup>w<sup>+</sup>B </italic>(abbreviated as <italic>X^X</italic>, <italic>Ya</italic><sup>2 </sup>and <italic>Y, Ya<sup>+</sup></italic>, respectively).

To detect the Y chromosome, a Y-chromosome specific (AATAC)n [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] repeat was labeled with Rhodamine-4-dUTP. To detect the X chromosome, a 1.688 satellite sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] specific to the X chromosome was labeled with fluorescein-dUTP. The maternal <italic>X^X </italic>and the paternal X are each seen as one signal with the 1.688 satellite probe. The 1.688 satellite probe also hybridizes to the Y, <italic>Ya<sup>+</sup></italic>chromosome, because the region of the X that is translocated to the Y chromosome contains the 1.688 satellite. Thus, we could distinguish between the maternal and paternal pronuclei in the mutant embryos fertilized by Y, <italic>Ya<sup>+</sup></italic>-bearing sperm: such embryos have both a maternal Y (because the mothers are X^X/Y) recognized only by the fluorescein Y probe, and a paternal Y, <italic>Ya<sup>+</sup></italic>chromosome, which hybridizes to both the X and Y chromosome probes. To detect chromosome 2, the histone gene repeat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] was labeled with biotin-16-dUTP, and hybridization signals were detected by incubating the eggs and embryos with Cy5-conjugated streptavidin.</p><p>Embryos and eggs were fixed using the procedure described in Lopezet al.

Eggs and embryos were analyzed using confocal microscopy (Leica TCS SP2 system equipped with an argon-krypton laser and coupled to a Leica DMRBE microscope). Leica software was used to collect images. Where appropriate, Leica software was used to project multiple optical sections into a single image and to overlay images. Because estimating nuclear ploidy by size and DNA intensity is confounded by the asynchronous condensation states of the nuclei, without FISH we cannot correlate asynchronous cell cycle state and abnormal nuclear associations.</p></sec><sec><title>Preparation and analysis of in vitro activated oocytes</title><p>Oocytes isolated from 400 to 1200 virgin females were obtained by blender agitation followed by serial sieve purification, according to [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] with minor modifications.

The position of the nuclei in the anterior of the <italic>Ya</italic><sup>2</sup> eggs and their orientation relative to the eggs' long axis appear normal. As in control eggs, a small percentage of <italic>Ya</italic><sup>2 </sup>eggs show four DAPI-stained nuclei, each of which is haploid (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>). Also as in controls, some YA-deficient eggs have a single condensed nucleus showing hybridization signals for the complements of all four meiotic products (unpublished observation), although the frequency of these eggs is lower than in controls. Some <italic>Ya</italic><sup>2 </sup>eggs also contain two DAPI-stained nuclei of the "3:1" type; as in control eggs, the larger nucleus has a triploid DNA content and the smaller has a haploid content (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F</xref>). Overall, the presence of a haploid nucleus in the "3:1" pattern, and the presence of eggs that show four haploid nuclei, together demonstrate that meiotic chromosome segregation occurs properly and is completed in the absence of YA function. The frequencies with which the three different normal nuclear distributions are observed vary somewhat between control and YA-deficient laid unfertilized eggs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>&#x00026;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1J</xref>), possibly because nuclear associations may occur more slowly in the absence of YA function.</p></sec><sec><title>Many meiotic products in YA-deficient unfertilized eggs exhibit abnormal associations</title><p>In addition to the normal classes of nuclear distribution just described, two abnormal nuclear distributions are seen in eggs from <italic>Ya</italic><sup>2</sup>females. First, ~34% of the <italic>Ya</italic><sup>2 </sup>eggs contain two diploid nuclei ("2:2" type) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1G</xref>); this phenomenon is never seen in wildtype eggs. One of these diploid nuclei contains two X^X chromosomes, while the other has two Y chromosomes. We never saw "2:2" type eggs in which any one nucleus contained both an X^X and a Y chromosome. Therefore, these nuclei likely derive from a failure to undertake or complete meiosis II or from abnormal association of sister nuclei following meiosis completion. We believe the latter explanation is correct because we can distinguish two individual copies of each chromosome in each associated pair of meiotic products as two FISH signals; if these eggs were arrested before anaphase II, the paired sister chromatids of a given homolog would reveal only one signal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Since the DAPI staining does not reveal the eggs to be in anaphase, we believe that these signals are of sister chromatids that segregated in meiosis II and are then present together after association of the meiotic products.</p><p>Second, ~14% of the <italic>Ya</italic><sup>2 </sup>eggs have three DAPI stained nuclei. These eggs all contain one nucleus with a diploid content of chromosomes, and two more that are haploid (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1H, I</xref>), but this nuclear distribution can further be divided into two subtypes. Eggs of the first subtype contain a diploid nucleus containing two second chromosomes, one X^X and one Y chromosome; and two haploid nuclei each with one second chromosome and one of the remaining sex chromosomes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1H</xref>). In this "1:2:1" subclass, the diploid nucleus is always positioned between the two haploid nuclei. The distribution of nuclei in these eggs demonstrates that meiosis II has been completed but that the central two nuclei, each products of a separate meiosis II spindle, have subsequently associated. In the second subtype of eggs with three nuclei, one nucleus is diploid and contains either two X^X chromosomes or two Y chromosomes, and two nuclei are haploid, each containing one of the remaining sex chromosomes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1I</xref>). In these "2:1:1" eggs the {X^X X^X} or {Y Y} diploid nuclei are never found between the two haploid nuclei; they are always one of the outer nuclei of the three (that is, either the nucleus closest to the egg cortex or the nucleus closest to the center of the egg). The "2:1:1" nuclear distribution could result from failure of segregation in one of the two meiotic spindles of meiosis II. However, given the "1:2:1" nuclei also observed in <italic>Ya</italic><sup>2 </sup>eggs, the simplest explanation is that meiosis completes normally, but subsequently two resulting haploid meiotic products then associate or fuse (See Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref> &#x02013; Figure S1).</p><p>Every category of associated nuclei observed in <italic>Ya</italic><sup>2 </sup>eggs requires, or is at least consistent with, normal completion of meiosis. Our results thus all suggest that completion of meiosis does not require YA function, but that lack of YA function does disrupt proper associations between the nuclei produced by meiosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Meiosis completes upon in vitro activation of YA-deficient unfertilized eggs</title><p>We used in vitro activation to test independently whether meiosis can complete in <italic>Ya</italic><sup>2 </sup>eggs. As observed by Page &#x00026; Orr-Weaver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], in vitro activation of a pool of oocytes results in a range of meiotic stages depending on the length of incubation in hypotonic buffer (See Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref> &#x02013; Figure S2). For oocytes incubated for 15 +/- 1 minutes we found similar distributions of meiotic stages from <italic>Ya</italic><sup>2</sup> females and wildtype females, indicating that progression through meiosis is not dependent on YA function (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).

However, we did not observe any "pre-gonomeric" embryos among our 0&#x02013;15 minute control embryo collections, probably because meiosis is completed very rapidly after fertilization (which occurs internally in <italic>Drosophila</italic>). Instead, the wildtype embryos we saw in our collections had three polar bodies and a diploid nucleus, presumably the gonomeric region, which contains the female and male pronuclei; one such embryo, a female, is shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Meiotic product behavior in control and YA-deficient embryos</bold>.

However, in a majority of <italic>Ya</italic><sup>2 </sup>embryos, non-wildtype nuclear arrangements occur. In 52% of embryos, the male pronucleus does not associate with a maternal nucleus (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). Embryos with five separate haploid nuclei were fixed very shortly after meiosis completion and fertilization, so the male pronucleus would not normally yet have associated with a maternal nucleus in these embryos, but in fixed embryos where any other nuclear associations have occurred, there should have been time before fixation for the male pronucleus to associate with the female pronucleus. Some of these embryos contain a tetraploid nucleus derived entirely from maternal products, while others contain both haploid and diploid nuclei (data not shown and Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>, respectively). In 13% of <italic>Ya</italic><sup>2</sup> embryos, the male pronucleus has associated with a maternally-derived diploid nucleus, the latter likely reflecting one of the 2:2 abnormal associations seen in unfertilized eggs. For example, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref> shows a triploid nucleus composed of two maternally derived pronuclei (each with a Y-chromosome) and a paternally derived pronucleus (with the paternal Y-chromosome). This sort of association is never seen in wildtype. Finally, 17% of the <italic>Ya</italic><sup>2 </sup>embryos are in various stages of deterioration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], with fragmented or dramatically decondensed nuclei such that the number of chromosomes to which the probes bound was difficult to determine (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref> &#x02013; Figure S4).</p><p>The chromosome complements of <italic>Ya</italic><sup>2 </sup>embryo nuclei are consistent with the idea that after fertilization, meiosis is completed, the same abnormal nuclear associations as we previously found in unfertilized <italic>Ya</italic><sup>2 </sup>eggs can occur, and then the male pronucleus may or may not join with one of the resultant maternal nuclei. In over half the embryos the male pronucleus does not associate with a maternally-derived nucleus, while in other cases the male pronucleus associates inappropriately with groups of maternally-derived haploid nuclei. These results suggest that in the absence of YA function, the maternally- and paternally-derived haploid nuclei either fail to develop their identity (as a polar body versus a pronucleus), or that nuclei without YA are defective in the processes that normally ensure proper associations between the two pronuclei and among the three polar body nuclei. YA's localization to the nuclear lamina is potentially consistent with a role either in establishing pronuclear identity or in governing pronuclear apposition. Since there normally are some differences between pronuclei, such as distinct chromatin methylations or acetylations observed in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>], the mouse AKAP95 protein being specific to the female pronucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>], or the <italic>Drosophila </italic>histone H3.3 and HIRA proteins that are only present in the male pronucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], a protein such as YA that assists in pronuclear coordination prior to the first mitosis may be essential to proceeding on to embryogenesis. Our observation in this study that no <italic>Ya</italic><sup>2 </sup>embryos displayed signs of nuclear division past the gonomeric division, consistent with Lin and Wolfner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] and Liu et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], supports the model that YA is required for embryonic mitosis.</p><p>The abnormal nuclear associations in <italic>Ya</italic><sup>2 </sup>eggs and embryos are quite different from the lack of male pronuclear association due to defects in pronuclear migration that occurs in mutants of four genes that encode microtubule-related proteins (<italic>KLP3A, asp, ncd</italic>, and <italic>polo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]). These mutants and <italic>Ya</italic><sup>2 </sup>share the phenotype of improper male pronuclear association. However, the <italic>Ya</italic><sup>2</sup>phenotype does not include repeated haploid mitosis of the female polar bodies as seen in <italic>ncd </italic>or <italic>polo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>], nor is chromatin condensation in <italic>Ya</italic><sup>2 </sup>embryos normal as it is in <italic>KLP3 </italic>or <italic>asp </italic>embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. If these phenotypes were more similar, a pronuclear migration defect might be proposed to explain the failure of the male pronucleus to associate with a female pronucleus in roughly half of <italic>Ya</italic><sup>2 </sup>embryos. Given the additional differences between the phenotypes of mutant microtubule-related proteins and the <italic>Ya</italic><sup>2</sup>phenotype, it seems likely that instead of YA functioning in regulating physical migration of the pronuclei, YA acting in the nuclear lamina to establish pronuclear identity may facilitate subsequent pronuclear apposition.</p><p>In addition to the nuclear association defects reported here, <italic>Ya</italic><sup>2 </sup>egg and embryo nuclei also have a phenotype of overcondensed chromatin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. This overcondensation observed by DAPI staining is especially apparent in nuclei of "3:1" mutant unfertilized eggs. The volume of their larger nucleus would be expected to be three times greater than that of a haploid nucleus, but instead these triploid nuclei often appear very small due to highly condensed chromatin (data not shown). Similar observations of overcondensed chromatin can be made for diploid and tetraploid nuclei in <italic>Ya</italic><sup>2 </sup>eggs and embryos. YA's localization to the nuclear lamina and chromatin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] is potentially consistent with a role in governing chromatin condensation state.</p></sec><sec><title>Meiotic products in some YA-deficient eggs and embryos are asynchronous in PCNA and PH3 distribution</title><p>Because <italic>Ya</italic><sup>2 </sup>embryos complete meiosis but do not undergo the first mitotic division, we wanted to determine more precisely the cell cycle characteristics of the nuclei of YA-deficient eggs and embryos.

Although condensed chromatin is usually mitotic, the highly condensed chromatin in <italic>Ya</italic><sup>2 </sup>eggs and embryos does not always resemble that of mitotic nuclei. Thus, we used antibodies to phospho-histone H3 (PH3) to determine whether the mutant's nuclei contained a histone modification characteristic of mitotic chromatin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>], and we used antibodies against PCNA, a component of the replication fork, to identify replicating (S phase) chromatin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>].</p><p>The chromatin of condensed and overcondensed nuclei in <italic>Ya</italic><sup>2 </sup>eggs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>) and embryos (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>) stain with PH3, as do condensed wildtype nuclei (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>), indicating that condensed or overcondensed <italic>Ya</italic><sup>2 </sup>chromatin is in a mitotic-like state. However, cell-cycle asynchrony of nuclear chromatin in a given egg or embryo is observed: in 25% of <italic>Ya</italic><sup>2 </sup>unfertilized eggs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>) and 6% of <italic>Ya</italic><sup>2 </sup>embryos (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>), some nuclei are condensed and have PH3 staining, while one or more other nuclei are neither condensed nor show PH3 staining (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).

During this period, female meiosis must be completed and chromatin must be reorganized to transform the meiotic products into the female pronucleus and polar bodies, and the sperm nucleus into a male pronucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Since the arrest point of <italic>Ya</italic><sup>2 </sup>mutant embryos is prior to the first mitosis, we examined here whether YA is needed for any of these events. Here we report that YA-deficient eggs and embryos appear to complete meiosis. Subsequently, the maternally-derived meiotic products and sperm nucleus lose their normal cell-cycle coordination and form abnormal associations, but these nuclei can still undergo at least some DNA replication. Because the arrest occurs after the end of meiosis and after the initiation of S phase, YA, or processes downstream of YA, appear to regulate molecules participating in the S--&#x0003e;(G2)--&#x0003e; M transition rather than those involved in the meiosis--&#x0003e;(G1)---&#x0003e;S phase transition.</p><p>The timing of the requirement for YA after egg activation is coincident with its localization to the nuclear lamina upon completion of meiosis, when the meiotic products decondense their chromatin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Loss of nuclear identity, coupled with abnormal associations of haploid nuclei, is a phenotype that is consistent with disruption of nuclear envelope constituents. YA's ability to interact with chromatin would allow YA to sense, regulate, or transduce information concerning the chromatin condensation state. YA may function through its binding to lamin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], DNA, and/or histone H2B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] to detect and maintain a coordinated chromatin state of the male and female pronuclei appropriate for the gonomeric mitosis; in its absence cell cycle progression would be arrested due to the presence of asynchronous meiotic products or apposed pronuclei [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. YA's interaction with chromatin may be appropriate for restoring chromatin synchrony to permit the gonomeric mitosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>JML did the FISH analysis, CLB did the in vitro activation studies, and KLS did the immunofluorescence analysis of cell cycle markers.
