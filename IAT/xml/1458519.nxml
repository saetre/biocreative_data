Post-translational modification of these proteins is largely responsible for regulating their activity. The FACT (facilitates chromatin transcription) complex, a heterodimer of hSpt16 and SSRP1, is a chromatin structure modulator whose involvement in transcription and DNA replication has been reported. Here we show that nucleosome binding activity of FACT complex is regulated by poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation. hSpt16, the large subunit of FACT, is poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated by poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) resulting from physical interaction between these two proteins. The level of hSpt16 poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation is elevated after genotoxic treatment and coincides with the activation of PARP-1. The enhanced hSpt16 poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation level correlates with the dissociation of FACT from chromatin in response to DNA damage. Our findings suggest that poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of hSpt16 by PARP-1 play regulatory roles for FACT-mediated chromatin remodeling.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Post-translational modification of proteins by phosphorylation, acetylation, methylation or poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation is known to modulate the chromatin-template activities. Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of proteins may affect protein&#x02013;protein and protein&#x02013;DNA interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>). <italic>In</italic> v<italic>itro</italic> poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation has been described for many nuclear proteins that results in a down-regulation of their functions.</p><p>Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs) make up a family of enzymes with conserved catalytic domain at the C-terminal region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>). These enzymes catalyze the transfer of ADP-ribose from NAD<sup>+</sup> onto acceptor proteins, including themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>). The most abundant and best-characterized member of PARP family is PARP-1. Formation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymers occurs rapidly after DNA damage and appears to be primarily due to PARP-1 activation. The sites of poly(ADP-ribose) accumulations often coincide with DNA damage foci or actively transcribed gene loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>). Although not absolutely required for repair, loss of PARP-1 reduces the ability of cells to deal with DNA damage. Recent studies have established that poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation involves not only in the regulation of cellular response to genotoxic stress, but also ensures accurate transmission of genetic information during cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). Additionally, studies in recent years suggest the involvement of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of proteins in chromatin organization. Many targets of PARP-1 are involved in establishing chromatin architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>). Histones, especially H1 and H2B, are the major poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated chromatin proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>). Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of polynucleosomes causes relaxation of chromatin structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). Genetic studies in <italic>Drosophila</italic> also showed that PARP-1 is required for proper chromatin organization throughout the life cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>).</p><p>The eukaryotic genome is packaged into chromatin, which present a constant barrier to transcription and other cellular processes that require access to DNA. The accessibility to DNA is modulated by protein complexes that remodel chromatin structure. Two main enzyme activities that regulate chromatin accessibility could be distinguished. One class of chromatin remodeling complex consists of chromatin modifying complex which modifies the histone tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>). Another class, ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complex, uses energy of ATP hydrolysis to alter the chromatin structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). A recent report using biochemical approach has identified a new chromatin remodeling factor, FACT (facilitates chromatin transcription), that allows RNA polymerase II (pol II) to proceed along the chromatin template (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>). FACT, a heterodimer of hSpt16 and SSRP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>), binds and reorganizes the nucleosome to facilitate transcription on chromatin by pol II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). FACT has been found to be chromatin-associated, consistent with its roles in modulating chromatin organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>). Genetic studies in yeast have also demonstrated that both genes are essential for cell viability, global transcription and cell cycle progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>).</p><p>Both PARP-1 and FACT are involved in the global regulation of chromatin architecture. Recently, two sets of experiments strongly indicate that there is functional link between PARP-1 and FACT. A study of <italic>Drosophila</italic> polytene chromosomes showed that FACT is recruited to actively transcribed loci after heat shock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). The kinetics of FACT movement along the <italic>hsp70</italic> gene is similar to that of pol II and elongation factors Spt5 and Spt6. Another study demonstrated that <italic>Drosophila</italic> PARP is required for loosening chromatin structure and normal induction of Hsp70 after heat-shock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>). Significant amount of poly(ADP-ribose) are observed on the <italic>hsp70</italic> foci. These observations suggest that there is a possible functional link between poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation and FACT. We have sought to investigate the possible functional interaction between PARP-1 and FACT. We analyzed the modification of FACT immunoprecipitated from human cells. Our results showed that hSpt16 but not SSRP1 is poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated <italic>in vivo</italic> especially following genotoxic stress. Additionally, we showed that there is a direct interaction between hSpt16 and PARP-1. <italic>In vitro</italic> poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation assay demonstrated that hSpt16 is a substrate of PARP-1. We also showed that the nucleosome-binding activity of hSpt16 and FACT is decreased after poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation. These results suggest that transcription, DNA replication or repair may be regulated through the modulation of chromatin-binding property of FACT by PARP-1.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cell culture, plasmids and transient transfection</title><p>HeLa and 293T cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum at 37&#x000b0;C in a 5% CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere.

DNA of purified mononucleosome was analyzed on agarose gel. Recombinant human PARP-1, FLAG-tagged hSpt16 and His-tagged SSRP1 proteins were expressed in insect cells (Sf9) by recombinant baculoviruses. PARP-1 was purified to homogeneity by the procedure of Zahradka and Ebisuzaki (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). Briefly, insect cells were extracted with extraction buffer followed by two sequential ammonium sulfate precipitations of 30 and 70%. The pellet was suspended in buffer A (50 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl, pH 8.0, 0.2 M NaCl, 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 50 mM NaHSO3, 1 mM DTT and 1 mM EDTA) and desalted by passage through a Sephadex G-50 column. PARP-1 was concentrated by DNA-cellulose chromatography. Fractions containing purified enzyme were pooled and store at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C in aliquots. Analysis of the purified enzyme by SDS&#x02013;PAGE revealed a single protein of 110 kDa by Coomassie blue staining. Recombinant FLAG-hSpt16 and His-SSRP1 were purified by standard M2 anti-FLAG agarose or nickel-NTA affinity chromatography. For purification of FACT heterodimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>), the mixture of insect cell lysates containing FLAG-hSpt16 and His-SSRP1 was incubated with nickel-NTA. The bound proteins were eluted from the beads and subjected to M2 affinity purification. After extensive washing, the FACT heterodimers were eluted by FLAG peptide.

The poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation status of endogenous FACT immunoprecipitated from HeLa cells by hSpt16 specific antibody was determined using rabbit anti-poly(ADP-ribose) antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). FACT heterodimer remained intact under this immunoprecipitation condition, as determined by Coomassie blue staining (data not shown). A specific, albeit relatively weak, poly(ADP-ribose) signal corresponding to hSpt16 was detected in the immunoprecipitated FACT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, lane 2). The results showed that hSpt16 but not SSRP1 is poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated <italic>in vivo</italic>. A similar result was obtained when anti-SSRP1 monoclonal antibody was used to immunoprecipitate FACT heterodimer (data not shown and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).</p><p>To demonstrate the specificity of hSpt16 poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation, we examined the effects of a general PARP inhibitor, 3AB, on the poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation patterns of FACT.

The inhibition of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of hSpt16 by 3AB suggests that PARP activity is involved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, compare lanes 2 and 3). To exclude the possibility that the observed signal of poly(ADP-ribose) is due to associated proteins which co-migrate with hSpt16 on SDS&#x02013;PAGE, recombinant FLAG-tagged hSpt16 or FLAG-tagged SSRP1 was immunoprecipitated from transfected 293T cells with anti-FLAG M2-agarose and followed by extensive high salt (0.8 M NaCl) wash to remove possible associated proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

The level of precipitated proteins were shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> (lanes 4&#x02013;6).

The amount of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated hSpt16 increased 30 min post-irradiation. The kinetics of hSpt16 poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation correlates with the poly(ADP-ribose) synthesis of cell extracts following &#x003b3;-irradiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, compare lanes 1&#x02013;3 and 6&#x02013;8). 3AB treatment also abolished the incorporation of poly(ADP-ribose) into hSpt16 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, lane 9). The same membrane was re-probed with anti-FACT antibodies to demonstrate equal loading of proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, lanes 10&#x02013;18).

Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation depends on the presence of NAD<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, upper panel, lanes 1&#x02013;4). In the presence of NAD<sup>+</sup>, the slowly migrating smearing bands detected by the poly(ADP-ribose) antibody are the result of auto-poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of PARP-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, upper panel, lane 5). When either FLAG-hSpt16 or FACT heterodimer was included in the reaction, an additional band of poly(ADP-ribose) was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, lanes 7 and 8, shown as asterisk on the right side of upper panel). This band corresponds to the position of FLAG-hSpt16 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, lower panel, arrowhead) suggesting that the observed signal is due to poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of FLAG-hSpt16. No signal of poly(ADP-ribose) was observed in association with SSRP1 even in the presence of hSpt16 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, upper panel, lanes 6 and 8). Therefore, these results suggest that hSpt16 but not SSRP1 is a substrate of PARP-1.</p><p>Having demonstrated the poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of hSpt16 by PARP-1, we then addressed the effect of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation on the interaction between hSpt16 and PARP-1. <italic>In vitro</italic> poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation assays were carried out using solid-phase PARP-1 (prebound to protein G beads with PARP-1 specific antibody) and purified FLAG-hSpt16. The interaction between hSpt16 and PARP-1 before or after PARP-1 automodification was compared. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, slow migrating PARP-1 was present on top portion of the gel, suggesting that PARP-1 was heavily automodified, while the level of hSpt16 remained in the immunoprecipitate was reduced. These results suggest that like many other PARP-1 substrates, hSpt16 does not interact with the automodified PARP-1.</p></sec><sec><title>Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of hSpt16 alters the nucleosome binding property of FACT</title><p>Previous studies demonstrated that FACT interacts with mononucleosome via hSpt16 subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). To investigate the binding of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated hSpt16 to nucleosomes, we performed <italic>in vitro</italic> binding assay using purified mononucleosomes, recombinant PARP-1 and FLAG-hSpt16. Mononucleosomes and core histones were purified from HeLa cells (Supplementary Figure S2B). We first tested whether mononucleosome could be activated by mononucleosome. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, PARP-1 could be activated by DNA or mononucleosomes but not by core histones. Furthermore, in the presence of mononucleosomes, hSpt16 could be poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated by PARP-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). These data suggest that mononucleosome could serve as PARP-1 activator in the following <italic>in vitro</italic> mononucleosome-binding assay. FLAG-hSpt16 was incubated with purified PARP-1 and mononucleosome in the presence or absence of NAD<sup>+</sup>. After incubation, unbound proteins were removed by washing and the bound proteins were subjected to immunoblot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). FLAG-hSpt16 could bind to mononucleosome as reported previously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, lane 1 and data not shown). However, reduced binding of mononucleosome to hSpt16 was observed after poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, compare lanes 1 and 2). The effect of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of hSpt16 on the nucleosome binding of FACT was also studied. To exclude the possibility that the decreased interaction of FACT with mononucleosomes is due to modification of nucleosomal histones, endogenous FACT was purified from HeLa cells, and modified with PARP-1 in the presence of absence of NAD<sup>+</sup> (as described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). PARP-1 and DNA were removed from FACT after poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of hSpt16. The nucleosome-binding activity of pre-modified or control FACT was compared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Consistent with earlier results, disruption of interaction of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated FACT with mononucleosome could be observed. These results indicate that PARP-1-dependent poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of hSpt16 diminishes FACT's ability to associate with nucleosome <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Release of FACT from chromatin during DNA damage response</title><p>Finally we investigated whether the altered nucleosome binding of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated FACT could be observed in cells. Previous reports demonstrated that most endogenous FACT is associated with chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>). To study the possible dissociation of FACT from chromatin in response to DNA damage, we analyzed the chromatin-bound FACT by extracting the nuclear preparations from control or H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-treated HeLa cells with increasing concentrations of NaCl. In the absence of DNA damage, the majority of FACT was associated with chromatin and only insignificant amount of FACT was released between 10 and 100 mM NaCl. The release of hSpt16 and SSRP1 was observed at 200 mM NaCl indicating that it is chromatin associated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>). However, following H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment, significant portions of FACT were detected in the soluble fraction (i.e. 10&#x02013;100 mM NaCl) suggesting that a population of FACT is released from the chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, compare lanes 1 and 6). These results suggest that poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated FACT has weaker chromatin binding ability. We further studied the poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation status of FACT immunoprecipitated from different salt extracted fractions. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, higher level of poly(ADP-ribose) signal was detected in hSpt16 precipitated from low salt (100 mM NaCl) than high salt (i.e. 200 mM) fractions. Taken together, these data suggest that DNA damage-induced poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated Spt16 is released from the chromatin.</p><p>To further confirm these observations, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays which can monitor the interaction between protein and chromatin more directly. We analyzed the binding of FACT and histone H3 on the coding region of constitutively expressed &#x003b3;-actin gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). The association of histone H3 with actin gene showed no significant changes under control or DNA damage conditions. Consistent with the results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, the level of hSpt16 or SSRP1 associated with actin gene was greatly reduced after H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment. Furthermore, the reduction in actin gene association of hSpt16 was alleviated by pre-treatment of the cells with 3AB. The binding of SSRP1 to the actin gene was only partially attenuated by pre-treatment of the cells with 3AB. These results further support the concept that poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation modulates the nucleosome binding activity of FACT.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In this report we demonstrated that hSpt16 is poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated by PARP-1. We also discovered that this modification is up-regulated in response to genotoxic stress. These results suggest that the biological functions of FACT may be regulated by poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation. This finding lends further support for the importance of PARP-1-mediated poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of chromatin modulators in the regulation of DNA-dependent processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>).</p><p>Under normal conditions, basal level of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated proteins detected in the cells suggest that they participate not only in cellular response to DNA damage, but are also involved in the homeostasis of cellular functions. Previous studies have demonstrated that PARP-1 could be activated under normal conditions by certain undamaged DNA structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>), polynucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>) and PARP-1 interacting proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>). Enzymatic involvement of PARP-1 in the regulation of pol II dependent transcription has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>). In a number of model organisms, PARP-1 has been implicated in regulating gene expression. For example, activation of PARP-1 has been observed during transcription activation of genes in <italic>Drosophila</italic> salivary gland chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>). Recent studies with PARP-1 null mice and PARP-1 inhibitors have also demonstrated that the activity of PARP-1 is essential for NF-&#x003ba;B-dependent gene expression induced by various inflammatory stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>). Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation is also known to induce local chromatin re-organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>). The nucleosome-binding activity of hSpt16 and FACT are altered when poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated by PARP-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Our data indicate that PARP-1 may regulate FACT activity in the pol II dependent transcription. Belotserkovskaya <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>) showed that FACT helps to remove histones H2B/H2A dimer from a nucleosome during pol II transcription. Their model suggests that FACT facilitates pol II transcription by altering nucleosome structure in front of pol II and then reestablish chromatin architecture after pol II pass. But how FACT is switched off and on <italic>in vivo</italic> remains a mystery. Although the detailed interaction between FACT and nucleosome is still unclear, there is a strong preference for hSpt16 to bind to H2B/H2A dimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). Whether poly(ADP-ribosyl)ated FACT dissociate from nucleosome through the disruption of its interaction with the histones remains to be determined.</p><p>Transcriptional arrest in response to DNA damage may be regulated by several mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>). For example, DNA damage lesion has been shown to block the progression of elongating RNA polymerase and the stalled pol II can be released from the DNA template (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>). A recent study found that arrested pol II elongation complexes in response to DNA damage are the preferred substrates for ubiquitylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>). This DNA damage-induced polyubiquitylation of pol II is believed to induce destruction of irreversibly stalled elongation complex, enabling DNA repair and subsequent rounds of transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>). Published results also supported that poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation acts as a switch between transcription and DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>). Following DNA damage, PARP-1 is highly activated leading to rapid and transient poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of nuclear proteins and itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>). Active PARP-1 has been suggested to silent transcription through poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of transcription factors which interferes with their DNA-binding activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>). Our results demonstrate that the narrow time frame of the increased modification on hSpt16 coincides with the activation of PARP-1 under these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). This immediate modification correlates with the decreased affinity of FACT to chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). These data suggest that when activated, PARP-1 may regulate pol II-dependent transcription through modification of the nucleosome binding subunit of FACT.</p><p>There are at least 18 known members of the PARP gene family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>). In the present study, we do not exclude the possibility that other PARPs may also be able to modify hSpt16. PARP-2, which shares some common properties with PARP-1, is a possible candidate. PARP-2 is the only other PARP reported to mediate poly(ADP-ribose) synthesis in response to DNA damage. PARP-1 and PARP-2 participate in overlapping DNA damage response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>). The possible involvement of PARP-2 in the regulation of FACT may be studied in the future.</p><p>In this report, poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of SSRP1 was not observed. The reduced association of SSRP1 with chromatin was only partially preserved by pre-treatment with 3AB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). The interaction between hSpt16 and SSRP1 was not significantly influenced by poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5D</xref>). Although previous i<italic>n vitro</italic> assays using purified nucleosome have shown that hSpt16, but not SSRP1, is responsible for nucleosome binding property of FACT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>), SSRP1 was known to bind the specific structures of DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>)&#x02014;a likely scenario for the observed results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>. In agreement with this possibility, the study of Li <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>) demonstrated that phosphorylation of SSRP1 by CK2 in response to UV inhibited the DNA-binding activity of SSRP1 and FACT <italic>in vitro</italic>. These observations suggest that FACT is a target of multiple enzymes that confine transcription of pol II following genotoxic stress. Indeed, the complex network of signaling pathways leads to various post-translational modifications of FACT or sub-population of FACT may determine its activity. Accordingly, poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation of FACT by PARP-1 during genotoxic stress may be confined to a sub-population of FACT. Other modifications of FACT such as phosphorylation&#x02013;dephosphorylation and acetylation&#x02013;deacetylation may act in conjunction with poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation to modulate its nucleosome-binding and functions.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p>Supplementary Data are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="nar_34_8_2398__index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg" xlink:href="nar_34_8_2398__gkl241Fig_S1_sm.jpeg"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg" xlink:href="nar_34_8_2398__gkl241Fig_S2_sm.jpeg"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg" xlink:href="nar_34_8_2398__gkl241_Fig_S3_sm.jpeg"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Ming-Yue Lee for reading of the manuscript.
