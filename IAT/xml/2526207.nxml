Murine conventional DCs have been extensively studied and have traditionally been divided into five distinct subsets based on their expression of CD11b, CD4, CD8&#x003b1;, and Langerin. The spleen contains three of these subsets (CD11b<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, CD11b<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD4<sup>&#x02212;</sup> CD8&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;</sup>, and CD11b<sup>&#x02212;</sup> CD8&#x003b1;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>), whereas LNs contain two additional populations (CD4<sup>&#x02212;</sup> Langerin<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and CD4<sup>&#x02212;</sup> CD8&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;</sup> CD11b<sup>lo</sup>) that display a more mature phenotype and appear to represent tissue-derived migratory DCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>). Although the developmental relationships between these populations remains unclear, several of these subsets have been described to have distinct functional properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>). Nevertheless, surprisingly few studies have attempted to characterize DC subsets in human LN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>) and, thus, the possibility of targeting distinct conventional DC subsets for regulating human immune responses remains unclear. Indeed, to our knowledge functionally distinct conventional DC subsets in human LN have yet to be described.</p><p>Recent evidence suggests that the tissue environment in which DCs reside has a major impact on their phenotypic and functional properties. This is particularly apparent in the intestinal mucosa. Intestinal DCs are located throughout the villus lamina propria (LP) and in intestinal lymphoid tissue (Peyers Patches [PP], solitary isolated lymphoid tissue [SILT], and mesenteric LN [MLN]), where they play a central role in sampling and processing luminal as well as peripheral self antigen for presentation to T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). Several functional properties have recently been ascribed to murine intestinal DCs. These include an enhanced ability to promote FoxP3<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> regulatory T cell and IgA-secreting B cell differentiation and induction of gut-homing receptors (CCR9 and &#x003b1;4&#x003b2;7) on responding T and B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>). Remarkably, these diverse functions appear, at least in part, to be driven through intestinal DC&#x02013;mediated retinoic acid receptors (RAR) signaling. Thus, the vitamin A metabolite retinoic acid (RA) induces expression of gut-homing receptors and enhances FoxP3<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell and IgA B cell differentiation, whereas RAR antagonists block the ability of intestinal DCs to generate these populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>).</p><p>Only a subset of MLN DCs, which express the integrin &#x003b1; chain CD103, are efficient at inducing gut-homing receptors on responding T cells and FoxP3<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell differentiation in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>). CD103<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> MLN DCs express higher levels of <italic>aldh1a2</italic>, the gene encoding RALDH2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>) which is a key enzyme involved in metabolizing retinal to RA, compared with their CD103<sup>&#x02212;</sup> MLN counterparts. Consistent with this, CD103<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> MLN DCs induce enhanced RAR dependent signaling in responding T cells, compared with splenic or CD103<sup>&#x02212;</sup> MLN DCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>). Despite these findings, the relationship between CD103<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and CD103<sup>&#x02212;</sup> MLN DC subsets and the functional properties of these subsets in other tissues, including the small intestinal and colonic LP, remains unknown. Critically, it also remains to be determined whether these cells represent a functionally distinct population in human MLN and, thus, the potential of targeting CD103<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DCs for regulating intestinal immunity in humans is unclear.</p><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Murine small intestinal LP and MLN CD103<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DCs are unique in their capacity to efficiently induce CCR9 and RAR signaling in responding T cells</title><p>CD103<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DCs are present in a wide range of mucosal murine tissues and secondary lymphoid organs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>). Although CD103<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and CD103<sup>&#x02212;</sup> DCs isolated from mucosal tissues (small intestine LP [SI-LP], colonic LP, and lung) were CCR7<sup>&#x02212;</sup> CD40<sup>lo</sup>, the majority of CD103<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DCs in LN (MLN, lung draining mediastinal LN, and peripheral [axillary and brachial] LN) expressed CCR7 and high levels of CD40 and, thus, displayed a more mature phenotype than their peripheral counterparts and CD103<sup>&#x02212;</sup> LN DCs (Fig. S1, A and B, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080414/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080414/DC1</ext-link>; and not depicted). To determine whether the ability to efficiently induce CCR9 on T cells is a feature of all CD103<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DCs, CFSE-labeled CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>OT-I cells were primed with OVA peptide (pOVA; 2000 pM)&#x02013;pulsed CD103<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and CD103<sup>&#x02212;</sup> DCs from MLN, SI-LP, Colonic-LP, PP, and lung-draining LNs, and expression of tissue-homing receptors on responding T cells was assessed 6 d later. As expected, CD103<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, but not CD103<sup>&#x02212;</sup>, MLN DCs induced CCR9 on responding OT-I cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>). CD103<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> SI-LP DCs also efficiently induced CCR9 on responding T cells, whereas CD103<sup>&#x02212;</sup> SI-LP, CD103<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and CD103<sup>&#x02212;</sup> colonic LP, PP, and lung-draining LN DCs failed to do so (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, B and C</xref>). In contrast, all DC populations induced some &#x003b1;4&#x003b2;7 on responding OT-I cells (Fig. S2). CD103<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DCs and, in particular, intestinal CD103<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DCs induced higher levels of &#x003b1;4&#x003b2;7 compared with their CD103<sup>&#x02212;</sup> counterparts. Although CD103<sup>&#x02212;</sup> DCs induced less &#x003b1;4&#x003b2;7 expression, they were more efficient at inducing E-selectin ligand (which is required for effector cell migration to extraintestinal sites of inflammation) on responding T cells than CD103<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DCs, irrespective of their tissue origin (Fig. S2). We have recently demonstrated that OT-I cells express higher levels of CCR9 when primed with CD103<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and CD103<sup>&#x02212;</sup> MLN DCs that have been pulsed with a low-dose peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>). Because CCR9 expression by OT-I cells, in addition to DCs, is also regulated by antigen dose, we next determined the ability of the different DC preparations to induce expression of CCR9 at a lower and more permissive peptide dose. When we pulsed DCs with a 10-fold lower peptide dose (200 pM), CD103<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> PP and, to a lesser extent, CD103<sup>&#x02212;</sup> PP DCs induced CCR9 on responding T cells, although the percentage of cells expressing CCR9 remained significantly lower than that observed after priming with CD103<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> MLN DCs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>). CD103<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> colonic LP and lung-draining LN DCs also induced limited CCR9 expression under these conditions, whereas CD103<sup>&#x02212;</sup> colonic LP, lung-draining LN, and splenic DC subsets failed to efficiently induce CCR9 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref> and not depicted). Thus, although the mechanism underlying the antigen dose-dependent regulation of CCR9 expression by OT-I cells and whether CCR9 expression is influenced by antigen dose in other TCR transgenic systems are currently not known, these results demonstrate that at a lower peptide dose, there is also an inherent difference between CD103<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and CD103<sup>&#x02212;</sup> DCs, as well as between CD103<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DCs derived from different tissues, in their ability to efficiently confer CCR9 expression to OT-I cells.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Small intestinal LP and MLN CD103<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DCs are unique in their capacity to efficiently induce CCR9 on responding T cells.</bold> (A) Percentage of DCs (MHC class II<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD11c<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>) expressing CD103 in indicated organs.

To determine whether CCR9 induction correlated with enhanced DC-mediated RAR signaling, OT-I cells from OT-I.DR5 transgenic mice (which express luciferase under control of three RA response element (DR5) repeats [reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>]) were primed with pOVA (200 pM)-pulsed CD103<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> or CD103<sup>&#x02212;</sup> DCs, and luciferase activity in responding cells was assessed after 22 h (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>) at a time when OT-I cells have yet to divide (not depicted). We have previously demonstrated that DCs pulsed with 2,000 or 200 pM pOVA induce similar levels of RAR signaling in responding T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>). CD103<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> MLN DCs induced significantly greater luciferase activity in OT-I.DR5 cells than their CD103<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> PP and colonic counterparts (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>). In contrast, CD103<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> SI-LP DCs induced similar levels of RAR signaling as CD103<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> MLN DCs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>). DC-induced luciferase activity was dependent on RAR signaling, as it was inhibited by addition of the pan-RAR antagonist LE540 to the cell cultures (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E</xref>). Thus, the ability of CD103<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> MLN and SI-LP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DCs to efficiently induce CCR9 correlates with an enhanced ability to induce RAR signaling in responding T cells. Although CD103<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DCs in general appeared to induce slightly enhanced luciferase activity compared with CD103<sup>&#x02212;</sup> DCs (consistent with their enhanced ability to induce &#x003b1;4&#x003b2;7), these results demonstrate that the ability to induce high levels of RAR signaling and efficient CCR9 induction is not a general property of CD103<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DCs or intestinal DCs but is selective for CD103<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DCs that reside in the SI-LP and MLN.</p></sec><sec><title>CD103 is not required for intestinal DCs' ability to generate gut tropic T cells</title><p>The results in the previous section clearly demonstrate that CD103 signaling is not sufficient to imprint DCs with the ability to efficiently induce CCR9 and enhanced RAR signaling in responding T cells. However, it remained possible that CD103-mediated adhesion to E-cadherin on epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>) or putative ligands in the small intestinal LP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>) was required to expose CD103<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DCs sufficiently to imprinting signals. To assess this possibility, antigen-pulsed MLN DCs from CD103<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and WT mice were assessed for their ability to induce CCR9 and &#x003b1;4&#x003b2;7 on responding DO11.10 cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). From these experiments, it is clear that CD103<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> MLN DCs are as efficient as WT MLN DCs at inducing CCR9. Thus, CD103 is simply a marker of DCs in the SI-LP and MLN that have an enhanced ability to induce RAR signaling in responding T cells.</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>CD103 is not required for imprinting MLN DCs with the ability to induce CCR9 on responding T cells.</bold> 10<sup>5</sup> MLN DCs from WT and CD103<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> BALB/c mice were cultured together with 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> CFSE-labeled DO11.10 <italic>SCID</italic> CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells, and OVA and expression of CCR9 and &#x003b1;4&#x003b2;7 was assessed 6 (experiment 1 [Expt. 1]) or 7 (experiment 2) d later.

Given the differential ability of CD103<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and CD103<sup>&#x02212;</sup> SI-LP DCs to induce an RAR signal and CCR9 on responding T cells, we next determined whether CD103<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> SI-LP DCs derive directly from a DC precursor or from CD103<sup>&#x02212;</sup> SI-LP DCs (MHC class II<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> CD11c<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells) that up-regulate CD103 in the SI-LP. Mice received a single injection of BrdU i.p., and the percentage of BrdU<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> CD103<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and CD103<sup>&#x02212;</sup> DCs in the SI-LP was determined over time (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>). 3 h after BrdU injection, 8% (&#x000b1; 5.1%) of CD103<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> SI-LP DCs were BrdU<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, and this number increased to 16% (&#x000b1; 6.5%) by 9 h before leveling off. In contrast, 7% (&#x000b1; 2.0%) of CD103<sup>&#x02212;</sup> SI-LP DCs were BrdU<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> at 3 h, and this percentage increased only slightly over the subsequent 24-h period (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>). BrdU<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> CD103<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> SI-LP DCs were Ki67<sup>&#x02212;</sup> and, thus, not actively dividing (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>). Thus, there is a rapid turnover of both CD103<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and CD103<sup>&#x02212;</sup> DCs in the SI-LP. Further, because CD103<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> SI-LP DCs incorporated BrdU with at least as fast kinetics as CD103<sup>&#x02212;</sup> DCs (even at 90 min after injection; not depicted), it appears that the majority of CD103<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> SI-LP DCs do not derive from a CD103<sup>&#x02212;</sup> SI-LP DC intermediate but from an actively proliferating DC precursor population. To examine whether the villus SI-LP DC compartment is replenished by blood-derived or tissue-resident DC precursors, SI from C57BL/6.CD45.2 mice was grafted into C57BL/6.CD45.1 mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>).

BrdU<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> CD103<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DCs appeared in the MLN with much slower kinetics than in the SI-LP, with their numbers peaking at 48 h (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>).

After oral OVA administration, only CD103<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> MLN DCs induced OT-I and OT-II cell proliferation (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 A</xref>). To determine whether this was caused by a general inability of CD103<sup>&#x02212;</sup> MLN DCs to process and present antigen to T cells, similar experiments were performed after i.p.

In this paper, we show that SI-LP and MLN CD103<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DCs induce greater RAR signals and more efficiently induce CCR9 in responding T cells than other CD103<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> or CD103<sup>&#x02212;</sup> DC populations. We provide evidence that most CD103<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> SI-LP DCs develop directly from a circulating DC precursor, and not from CD103<sup>&#x02212;</sup> SI-LP DCs, and that the majority of CD103<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> MLN DCs represent a SI-LP&#x02013;derived migratory population that plays a critical role in presenting orally derived soluble antigen to T cells. Thus, these cells presumably capture orally applied antigens locally in the SI and subsequently migrate into the MLN. In contrast, most CD103<sup>&#x02212;</sup> MLN DCs appear to represent a blood-derived LN population that can proliferate in the MLN and present systemic antigen to T cells. Critically, we also demonstrate that CD103<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DCs are present in normal and inflamed human MLN and display similar phenotypic and functional properties to their murine counterparts. Thus, CD103<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> MLN DCs represent a potential novel target population for regulating human intestinal immune responses.</p><p>Our current results demonstrate that although all DCs appear to be capable of inducing limited RAR signaling in T cells, the ability to induce high RAR signaling and efficient CCR9 expression is not a general property of CD103<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DCs and, notably, not of CD103<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> Co-LP DCs but of SI-LP and MLN CD103<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DCs. As the latter population appears to derive from the former (see subsequent Discussion paragraphs), these results argue for a selective imprinting of CD103<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DCs, or their immediate precursors, in the SI-LP. In this regard, vitamin A itself is primarily absorbed through the SI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>), and incubation of monocyte-derived DCs with RA imprinted on these cells the ability to induce CCR9 on responding T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>). This activity was blocked with a RAR antagonist, but not a RALDH inhibitor, leading to the suggestion that CCR9 induction may be mediated by RA that has been taken up and stored by DCs. Nevertheless, incubation with high concentration of RA (1,000 nM) was required for this effect, and the in vivo relevance of these findings remains unclear. CD103<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> SI-LP and MLN DCs express higher levels of <italic>aldh1a2</italic> (unpublished data) (15) than their CD103<sup>&#x02212;</sup> counterparts, suggesting that their enhanced ability to induce RAR signaling may lie in an increased capacity to metabolize retinal. Although the signals inducing <italic>aldh1a2</italic> expression and the link between <italic>aldh1a2</italic> expression and DC-mediated RAR signaling remains unclear, addition of IL-4 to MLN DC-T cell cultures was recently found to enhance CCR9, but not &#x003b1;4&#x003b2;7, expression on responding CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>). Notably, MLN DCs from IL-4r&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice displayed a reduced capacity to induce CCR9 on CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells and had reduced levels of <italic>aldh1a2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>), although the composition of MLN DCs in these mice was not assessed. Moreover, CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells in the SI-LP of IL-4r&#x003b1;<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> expressed normal levels of CCR9. In the current study, the inability of CD103<sup>&#x02212;</sup> SI-LP DCs to induce enhanced RAR signaling suggests that imprinting signals are not ubiquitously expressed in the SI-LP or that CD103<sup>&#x02212;</sup> SI-LP DCs are incapable of responding to such signals. Notably, although CD103 expression on DCs appears to play a critical functional role in T cell&#x02013;mediated regulation of CD45RB<sup>hi</sup> T cell&#x02013;induced colitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>), our experiments with CD103<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> MLN DCs demonstrate that CD103 is not required for imprinting intestinal DCs with the ability to generate gut tropic T cells.</p><p>Irrespective of the imprinting mechanism, the similar initial kinetics of BrdU<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells within the CD103<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and CD103<sup>&#x02212;</sup> LP DC populations suggest that CD103<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> SI-LP DCs are not the progeny of CD103<sup>&#x02212;</sup> SI-LP (MHC class II<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD11c<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>) DCs. Moreover, our intestinal transplant experiments suggest that CD103<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> SI-LP DCs do not derive from resident proliferating precursors within the LP but are continually replenished by blood-borne precursors seeding the LP. This result, however, should be interpreted with a degree of caution, as we cannot at this point rule out that inflammation associated with the transplant surgery triggers the release of donor-derived DC precursors that are replaced by precursors of host origin. In the rat, small numbers of DCs were found in intestinal lymph that originated from adoptively transferred blood monocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>), indicating that at least some intestinal-LP migratory DCs are monocyte derived. Consistent with this possibility, murine CD11b<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>Gr1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> monocytes generate CD11c<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> LP cells when transferred into LP-DC&#x02013;depleted recipient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>), although further phenotypic analysis of the resulting population was not performed. It also remains to be determined whether CD103<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> or CD103<sup>&#x02212;</sup> SI-LP DCs derive from distinct DC precursors in the steady state or whether the same DC precursor population can generate both subsets depending on the microenvironmental signals they receive. The former possibility is supported by the recent observation that CCR2<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>Ly6C<sup>hi</sup> and CX3CR1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>Ly6C<sup>lo</sup> monocyte subsets replenish CD103<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and CD103<sup>&#x02212;</sup> lung DCs, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>).</p><p>Our current results also provide strong evidence that the majority of CD103<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and CD103<sup>&#x02212;</sup> MLN DCs derive from distinct populations of DCs. The delayed appearance of BrdU<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> CD103<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DCs in MLN compared with the SI-LP is compatible with the idea that most of these cells represent a tissue-derived migratory population. Consistent with this hypothesis, CD103<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DC numbers are reduced in the MLN of mice lacking CCR7, a chemokine receptor which is required for DC migration from peripheral tissues into the draining LN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>). CD103<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> Langerin<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DCs are present in the lung (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>) and are reduced in numbers in the LDLN of CCR7<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>). Furthermore, a radiosensitive CD103<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> Langerin<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DC population was recently identified in the skin dermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref>) that migrates to the skin, draining LN in the steady state in a CCR7-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref>). Together, these results suggest that most CD103<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DCs in intestinal and extraintestinal LN represent tissue-derived migratory DCs.</p><p>In marked contrast to CD103<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DCs, BrdU<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> CD103<sup>&#x02212;</sup> DCs accumulated with at least as rapid kinetics in the MLN as in the SI-LP, suggesting that the majority of these cells in MLN represent a resident population. In addition, most CD103<sup>&#x02212;</sup> LN DCs displayed an immature phenotype under steady state, a proposed characteristic of LN-resident DCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref>). Several mechanisms have been reported to help maintain the splenic and LN-resident DC compartment in the steady state. These include continuous recruitment of DC precursors from the blood and differentiation from tissue resident DC precursors, as well as a limited expansion of DCs themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref>). We found that &#x0223c;6% of CD103<sup>&#x02212;</sup> DCs in the MLN were Ki67<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> at any one time and were thus actively proliferating. Further, in combined Ki67 and BrdU staining, &#x0223c;60% of BrdU<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> CD103<sup>&#x02212;</sup> DCs were Ki67<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> 3 h after BrdU administration, suggesting that in the steady state, the CD103<sup>&#x02212;</sup> DC population is maintained in part through homeostatic proliferation and in part through the entry of DC precursors from the blood.</p><p>Our observations that only CD103<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> MLN DCs induce OT-I and OT-II proliferation after oral OVA administration demonstrate a key role for these cells in cross-presenting orally derived soluble antigen and confirm the importance of these cells in presenting oral antigen to CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>). We further show that this is not caused by a defect in the ability of CD103<sup>&#x02212;</sup> MLN DCs to present antigen, as these cells primed OT-I and, especially, OT-II cells after i.p. administration of antigen. These results, together with previous observations that OT-I and OT-II cells fail to respond to orally administered OVA in CCR7<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice but respond to i.p. OVA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">51</xref>), provides further evidence that CD103<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> MLN DCs represent the major tissue-derived migratory DC population that presents soluble luminal antigen to T cells.</p><p>We have previously demonstrated that CCR9 is more efficiently induced on adoptively transferred OT-I cells in the MLN after oral compared with i.p. OVA administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>). Thus, efficient induction of CCR9 correlates with enhanced antigen presentation by CD103<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DCs. Further, OT-I cells primed in the MLN of CCR7<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice after administration of OVA and adjuvant i.p. fail to express CCR9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>). Thus, reduced levels of CD103<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DCs in the MLN correlate with reduced CCR9 induction. Together, these correlations strongly indicate that CD103<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> MLN DCs are required for efficient CCR9 induction in vivo. Although &#x003b1;4&#x003b2;7 induction is also greatest under conditions of highest CCR9 induction, &#x003b1;4&#x003b2;7 is also induced on OT-I cells after i.p. OVA administration alone in both WT and CCR7<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. Because induction of &#x003b1;4&#x003b2;7 is RAR dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>), these results suggest that RAR signaling provided by additional cells in the MLN is sufficient to induce some &#x003b1;4&#x003b2;7 expression on T cells primed at this site. Indeed, &#x003b1;4&#x003b2;7 is induced on proliferating antigen-specific T cells in the MLN after i.p. injection of antigen-loaded BM or peripheral LN DCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">52</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">54</xref>). Determining the precise role of CD103<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> MLN DC&#x02013;mediated RAR signaling in the generation of gut tropic T cells and FoxP3<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T reg cell differentiation will likely require analysis of immune responses in mice selectively depleted of this unique subset of DCs.</p><p>To our knowledge, the phenotype and function of distinct DC subsets in human intestinal LN has not previously been examined. Given the unique functional characteristics of murine CD103<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> MLN DCs and their potentially important role in regulating intestinal immune responses, it was of central importance to determine the relevance of this population in humans. CD103<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> DCs were readily detected in MLN, draining both healthy SI and the SI of patients with Crohns disease. These cells, as in the mouse, displayed a more mature phenotype than their CD103<sup>&#x02212;</sup> counterparts. Total human MLN, but not splenic or liver, DCs have previously been shown to efficiently induce gut-homing receptors on responding B cells through an RAR-dependent mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>). Importantly, we demonstrate that the ability to induce CCR9 is not a general property of human MLN DCs but, again, selective for CD103<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> MLN DCs. Moreover, the selective ability of CD103<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> MLN DCs to induce CCR9 was maintained in Crohn's disease patients. Together, these results highlight the relevance of studying this population in murine models of intestinal homeostasis and inflammation and the future possibility of targeting these cells to regulate human intestinal immune responses in health and disease.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Mice and human tissues</title><p>C57BL/6 (Taconic), DR5 (provided by R.
