Proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 (PYK2) is a non-receptor kinase and has been found crucial to cell motility. However, little is known about whether SOCS3 could regulate PYK2 pro-migratory function in lung cancer.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The methylation status of SOCS3 was investigated in HBE and A549 cell lines by methylation-specific PCR. A549 cells were either treated with a demethylation agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine or transfected with three SOCS3 mutants with various functional domains deleted. Besides, cells were pretreated with a proteasome inhibitor &#x003b2;-lactacystin where indicated. The effects of SOCS3 up-regulation on PYK2 expression, PYK2 and ERK1/2 phosphorylations were assessed by western blot using indicated antibodies. RT-PCR was used to estimate PYK2 mRNA levels. Transwell experiments were performed to evaluate cell migration.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>SOCS3 expression was found impaired in A549 cells and higher PYK2 activity was correlated with enhanced cell migration. We identified that SOCS3 was aberrantly methylated in the exon 2, and 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine restored SOCS3 expression. Reactivation of SOCS3 attenuated PYK2 expression and phosphorylation, cell migration was inhibited as well. Transfection studies indicated that exogenous SOCS3 interacted with PYK2, and both the Src homology 2 (SH2) and the kinase inhibitory region (KIR) domains of SOCS3 contributed to PYK2 binding. Furthermore, SOCS3 was found to inhibit PYK2-associated ERK1/2 activity in A549 cells. SOCS3 possibly promoted degradation of PYK2 in a SOCS-box-dependent manner and interfered with PYK2-related signaling events, such as cell migration.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These data indicate that SOCS3 negatively regulates cell motility and decreased SOCS3 induced by methylation may confer a migration advantage to A549 cells. These results also suggest a negative role of SOCS3 in PYK2 signaling, and a previously unidentified regulatory mechanism for PYK2 function.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Proline-rich tyrosine kinase 2 (PYK2) is a ubiquitously expressed non-receptor protein tyrosine kinase that contributes to integrate signals from receptor tyrosine kinases and intracellular signaling molecules in processes such as cell survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] and motility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. PYK2 is hard to detect in early embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], however macrophages from PYK2-knockout embryos demonstrate severe migration and function defects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], and loss of Pyk2 kinase activity induces prostate cells to acquire a malignant, migratory phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Conversely, enhanced PYK2 signaling facilitates cell survival in an anchorage-independent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], and promotes cell motility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Moreover, inhibition of Pyk2 mostly results in decreased cell migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Along these lines, report has been shown that PYK2 expression and/or its activity are up-regulated in invasive cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Ligand binding of receptor tyrosine kinase results in autophosphorylation at Tyr402, which serves as a binding site for several Src homology 2 (SH2) domain-containing proteins, such as Src kinase. The PYK2-Src complex leads to further phosphorylation of PYK2, resulting in activation of a number of cytoskeleton-linked proteins, which transduce signals to downstream pathways, such as the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase cascades, and leads to control of cell survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], and migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. At present, little is known about the molecular mechanisms that negatively regulate PYK2 function in lung cancer.</p><p>Suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3) is a member of SOCS family and acts in a feedback loop to inhibit cytokine responses and STAT3 activation in various cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Evidence has indicated that SOCS3 regulates other signaling pathways as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. SOCS3 expression is suppressed due to aberrant methylation in its promoter region, which frequently occurs in a variety of human tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The SOCS3 protein is structurally composed of distinct functional domains, including a N-terminal kinase inhibitory region, a central SH2 domain and a C-terminal homologous region termed SOCS-box. In many cases, SOCS3 interacts with phosphorylated tyrosine residues mediated by the SH2 and KIR domains, and negatively regulates activities of tyrosine kinases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The SOCS-box may act as a bridge to mediate degradation of target proteins that interact with SOCS3-SH2 by the proteasome pathway. Researches have proved that SOCS3 not only regulates the STAT3 signaling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] but also the FAK tyrosine kinase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>We report here that SOCS3 was down-regulated due to methylation in the exon 2 and reactivated after 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine treatment in A549 cells. SOCS3 was found to interact with PYK2 by its SH2 and KIR domains, and facilitate PYK2 degradation via proteasome pathway, and to inhibit Tyr402 and ERK1/2 phosphorylations as well as PYK2-associated migration of A549 cells. These results identify a potential role of SOCS3 in regulating PYK2 signaling.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cells treatment and transfection</title><p>HBE cells (human bronchial epithelial) were grown in RPMI 1640, and A549 cells (human lung adenocarcinoma) were cultured in DMEM, both supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum.

The SOCS3-SH2 mutant is a full length SOCS3 without the SH2 region, consisting of the KIR and SOCS-box domains. The KIR domain is knocked out in the SOCS3-KIR mutant, with the SH2 and SOCS-box regions remained. And the SOCS-box mutant contains the SH2 and KIR domains, with the SOCS-box deleted. A myc tag was added to each of these SOCS3 mutants, and exogenous SOCS3 mutants were represented by the detection of myc tag.

Researches on human cancers have indicated that down-regulation of SOCS3 was correlated with aberrant methylation. Thus, in our studies, three methylation- and non-methylation-specific primer sets were used to detect methylation status of SOCS3 in the exon 1, intron 1 and exon 2 in A549 cells respectively.

Moreover, no methylation was observed in HBE cells as well. Therefore, methylation in the exon 2 was correlated with the decrease of SOCS3 expression in A549 cells. The non-methylation specific amplification instead of methylation was detected after the demethylation agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine treatment, and SOCS3 expression was restored (p &#x0003c; 0.05, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3b</xref>), which further demonstrated that SOCS3 was methylated in A549 cells.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Methylation status and expression of SOCS3 in HBE and A549 cells.</bold> (a) Methylation status of SOCS3 in HBE and A549 cells, using the primer set designed in the exon 2, and detection of SOCS3 expression by western blot.

Our studies in this report demonstrated that SOCS3 might have a previously unidentified role in negatively regulating PYK2 function. The expression of SOCS3 is decreased due to aberrant methylation, and its transcriptional silencing is associated with malignant tumor behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Human SOCS3 gene is composed of the noncoding exon 1, intron 1 and exon 2. In our studies, the methylation- and non-methylation-specific primers were used to detect methylation status of SOCS3 in the exon 1, intron 1 and exon 2 in A549 cells respectively. We found SOCS3 methylation in the exon 2, which lies in a region of 92&#x02013;250 bp downstream to the translation start site, although no detectable methylation was found in the promotor region containing the noncoding exon 1 and intron 1, which was consistent with the previous findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. This demonstrated that methylation in the exon 2 was associated with the decrease of SOCS3 expression in A549 cells. The demethylation agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine reactivated SOCS3, which further indicated that SOCS3 expression was attenuated by the associated methylation. Taken together, the exon 2 of SOCS3 appeared to be a crucial target for methylation in A549 cells. However, the significance of methylation in exons has not been elucidated.</p><p>It has been shown that SOCS3 transfection inhibited proliferation of A549 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. We therefore examined the effect of SOCS3 up-regulation on migration of A549 cells. In our studies, we found that SOCS3 restoration inhibited cell migration. The negative regulation of SOCS3 was previously reported in PDGF-induced fibroblast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] and HGF-promoted keratinocyte migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], which was mediated by STAT3. However, STAT3 pathway may not be involved in SOCS3 methylation-induced migration of A549 cells, because STAT3 binding sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] are not included in the exon 2 of SOCS3. These data supported that SOCS3 methylation-associated inactivation might facilitate cell motility, and SOCS3 reactivation by 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine treatment inhibited migration of A549 cells.</p><p>A growing number of reports have demonstrated that PYK2 plays a significant role in development of various tumors. In metastatic glioma cells and hepatocellular carcinoma, PYK2 expression is significantly elevated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. PYK2 becomes Tyr402-phosphorylated in invasive breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] and SCLC cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], and PYK2-associated ERK1/2 activation participates in up-regulating the adhesive ability of PCa cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Pyk2 becomes activated by a number of cytokines that are also known to regulate SOCS3, such as SDF-1/CXCL12 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. As a negative regulator for PYK2 in T cells, SOCS3 showed migration suppression activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. We also notice that SOCS3 binds to the phosphorylated Tyr397 of FAK, a close homolog of PYK2, and inhibits its kinase activity or induces degradation by proteasome pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Thus, similar mechanisms of interaction and inhibition could apply to PYK2. We found that PYK2 expression, Tyr402 and ERK1/2 phosphorylations were inhibited with the increasing expression of SOCS3 by the treatment of 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. PYK2 seemed to be down-regulated by proteasome-mediated degradation, because pretreatment with &#x003b2;-lactacystin restored PYK2 expression, Tyr402 and ERK1/2 phosphorylations to some extent and PYK2 mRNA levels were unchanged no matter whether treatment or not. As we concluded, inhibited migration of A549 cells was associated with the reduced PYK2 expression, Tyr402 and ERK1/2 phosphorylations after SOCS3 restoration.</p><p>We further examined the effects of SOCS3 mutants on cell motility, and the associated PYK2 expression, Tyr402 and ERK1/2 phosphorylations. When SOCS3-SH2 mutant exogenously expressed in A549 cells, the PYK2 expression, Tyr402 and ERK1/2 phosphorylations, as well as cell migration were unchanged regardless of whether transfection or not. Moreover, the interaction of exogenous SOCS3-SH2 mutant with PYK2 was not detected. These findings indicated that the SH2 region inactivated mutant deprived SOCS3 of the ability to down-regulate PYK2-associated signaling and function in A549 cells. Therefore, the SH2 domain is crucial for SOCS3 regulating PYK2.</p><p>Compared with control cells, A549 cells with SOCS3-KIR mutant showed decreased PYK2 expression. Tyr402 and ERK1/2 phosphorylations, as well as cell mobility. Pretreatment with &#x003b2;-lactacystin restored PYK2 expression, Tyr402 and ERK1/2 phosphorylations, and cell migration to some extent. We proposed that the binding of SOCS3 with PYK2 via SH2 domain and SOCS-box-mediated proteasome-dependent degradation of PYK2 led to the suppressed migration of transfected A549 cells. The roles of SOCS3-KIR mutant were observed definitely, however the potential interaction as we presumed between the exogenous SOCS3-KIR mutant and PYK2 was not detected. We supposed that SOCS3-KIR mutant interacted with PYK2 principally by the central SH2 domain, generating the inhibition effects, however the binding was a functional interaction, unstable and readily reversible, and the effects would be transient without the help of KIR domain, thus could not be detected by immunoprecipitation in vitro. Therefore we concluded that the KIR domain is possibly required for a more stable binding of SOCS3 with PYK2 based on the SH2 domain. Further investigation is required to demonstrate our point of view.</p><p>The SOCS-box mutant had no influence on PYK2 expression, but Tyr402 and ERK1/2 phosphorylations were reduced in contrast to control cells. The migration of transfected A549 cells was also inhibited. These data denoted that the SOCS-box inactivated mutant down-regulated PYK2-associated signaling and function possibly by binding to PYK2 via the SH2 domain and inhibiting PYK2 activation by the KIR domain. PYK2 was detected in cell lysates immunoprecipitated with anti-myc tag antibody, which suggested a direct interaction between SOCS-box mutant and PYK2. Taken together, the stable interaction between exogenous SOCS3 and PYK2 is dependent on the SH2 and KIR domains of SOCS3, which results in the observed decrease in PYK2 expression, leading to the subsequent Tyr402 and ERK1/2 inactivations.</p><p>Studies have demonstrated that Tyr402 phosphorylation of PYK2 leads to binding of the SH2 domain and activation of Src [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], or integration of the SH2 domain of CHK and inhibition of breast cancer cell migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Our results are suggestive of an important role of SOCS3 in blocking Tyr402 phosphorylation. However, it remains to be determined whether Tyr402 mediates the interaction between SOCS3 and PYK2. Moreover, the precise role of SOCS3 in regulating migration-associated cytoskeleton proteins downstream of PYK2 has not been characterized in relation to lung cancer metastasis. Taken together, our results indicate that SOCS3 interacts with PYK2 and inhibits PYK2-associated migration of A549 cells. Further research is needed to clarify the pathological significance of PYK2 expression and interaction with SOCS3 in various signaling pathways. Studies of SOCS3 may foster new anti-chemotactic approaches to suppress lung cancer metastasis.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our data suggested that SOCS3 negatively regulates cell motility and decreased SOCS3 induced by methylation may confer a migration advantage to A549 cells. Exogenous SOCS3 interacted with PYK2, and both the SH2 and KIR domains of SOCS3 contributed to PYK2 binding. These results also suggest a negative role of SOCS3 in PYK2 signaling, and a previously unidentified regulatory mechanism for PYK2 function.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>SZ initiated the research, carried out the experiments and wrote the manuscript, DG contributed to the paper translation, LJ and QZ gave experimental instructions, XQ helped with the experimental design and gave funding support, and EW gave critical review of the manuscript.
