Mutation of the widely expressed <italic>oto</italic> gene causes loss of the anterior forebrain during mouse embryogenesis. Here we report that <italic>oto</italic> is the mouse ortholog of the gpi deacylase gene <italic>pgap1</italic>, and that the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident Oto protein has a novel and deacylase-independent function during Wnt maturation. Oto increases the hydrophobicities of Wnt3a and Wnt1 by promoting the addition of glycophosphatidylinositol (gpi)-like anchors to these Wnts, which results in their retention in the ER. We also report that <italic>oto</italic>-deficient embryos exhibit prematurely robust Wnt activity in the Wnt1 domain of the early neural plate. We examine the effect of low <italic>oto</italic> expression on Wnt1 <italic>in vitro</italic> by knocking down endogenous <italic>oto</italic> expression in 293 and M14 melanoma cells using shRNA. Knockdown of <italic>oto</italic> results in increased Wnt1 secretion which is correlated with greatly enhanced canonical Wnt activity. These data indicate that <italic>oto</italic> deficiency increases Wnt signaling <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>. Finally, we address the mechanism of Oto-mediated Wnt retention under <italic>oto</italic>-abundant conditions, by cotransfecting Wnt1 with gpi-specific phospholipase D (GPI-PLD). The presence of GPI-PLD in the secretory pathway results in increased secretion of soluble Wnt1, suggesting that the gpi-like anchor lipids on Wnt1 mediate its retention in the ER. These data now provide a mechanistic framework for understanding the forebrain defects in <italic>oto</italic> mice, and support a role for Oto-mediated Wnt regulation during early brain development. Our work highlights a critical role for ER retention in regulating Wnt signaling in the mouse embryo, and gives insight into the notoriously inefficient secretion of Wnts.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="16"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Wnts are a family of secreted, cysteine-rich signaling proteins that affect cell fate and proliferation in a wide variety of contexts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006191-Burrus1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006191-Logan1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

To add to our previous phenotypic characterization of <italic>oto</italic>, we now reveal the identity of the <italic>oto</italic> gene, and present an investigation into the molecular function of the Oto protein. Phenotypic parallels with Wnt-inhibitor mutant mice initially suggested that <italic>oto</italic> might act as a Wnt antagonist during early brain development. Instead, we find that Oto regulates Wnt secretion via a novel mechanism. We show that Oto is a widely expressed, ER-resident glycoprotein involved in adding atypical <underline>g</underline>lycophos<underline>p</underline>hatidyl<underline>i</underline>nositol (gpi) anchors to Wnts 1 and 3a, which results in their retention in the ER. We further show that Oto is required for the correct initiation of Wnt signaling in the Wnt1 domain of the early neural plate. In <italic>oto</italic>-deficient embryos, neurectodermal Wnt signaling in the Wnt1 domain begins prematurely and robustly, which is consistent with the loss of Oto-mediated Wnt retention. The early neural plate in <italic>oto</italic> mutants thus exhibits an abnormally large medial domain of Wnt activity, and the <italic>oto</italic> embryo subsequently develops with a truncated forebrain.</p><p>Our results reveal the existence of a novel Oto-dependent mechanism that retains Wnts in the ER of Wnt producing cells. We also present evidence that intracellular cleavage of gpi anchor lipids stimulates Wnt secretion. We propose that gpi-anchoring of Wnts provides a means of accumulating, and then releasing, a regulated burst of Wnt ligands. Conversely, in the absence of <italic>oto</italic>, we show that active Wnt flows out of the cell in a relatively uninhibited manner. We thus describe a new mechanism involved in the production of Wnt ligands, that has an important role during mammalian embryogeneis. Given the widespread expression of <italic>oto</italic> throughout mammalian life, this novel mode of Wnt regulation likely extends to other Wnt-dependent processes in development and disease.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Identity of the oto gene</title><p>The recessive, lethal <italic>oto<sup>xray</sup></italic> mutation was mapped to a 284 kilobase interval on chromosome 1 which contains two genes, <italic>TFIIIc</italic> and <italic>oto/pgap1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006191-g001">Fig. 1a</xref>).

Three bands appear in each phase; lowest is naked polypeptide, and middle and upper bands are singly and doubly N-glycosylated isoforms, respectively. In transient transfections, when the amount of Oto DNA is varied and Wnt3a DNA is constant, an interesting pattern emerges. When Oto is present, a new insoluble isoform of Wnt3a appears, at the expense of soluble Wnt3a. As Oto expression increases, more Wnt3a is converted to the hydrophobic isoform. This isoform is upshifted relative to naked Wnt3a, migrating at 42 kDa; smaller, insoluble degradation products are also observed. Since its formation is Oto-dependent, we will call the 42 kDa isoform Oto-modified Wnt3a. We use this designation for convenience and do not intend to imply that Oto directly catalyzes a modification reaction. After de-N-glycosylation with PNGaseF, Oto-modified Wnt3a still migrates at 42 kDa while Wnt3a expressed alone collapses to the 0 glycosylation state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006191-g003">Fig. 3c</xref>), revealing that the Oto-modification is not an N-glycan. Because the 4&#x02236;1 ratio of Oto:Wnt DNA yielded the most Oto-modified Wnt3a, this ratio was used in subsequent experiments, with the control being a 4&#x02236;1 DNA ratio of empty vector:Wnt or gfp:Wnt.</p><p>Hydrophobicity of Wnt3a can be increased by palmitoylation on a conserved cysteine, C77 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006191-Willert1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, and by addition of palmitoleic acid to serine 209 (S209) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006191-Takada1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Both of these lipidations are mediated by porcupine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006191-Galli1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. To determine whether Oto's modification of Wnt3a involves C77, we tested a Wnt3a deletion construct lacking the palmitoylated residue (Wnt3a&#x00394;31&#x02013;107). Wnt3a&#x00394;31&#x02013;107 is fully soluble in RIPA when expressed alone, but is completely shifted to the insoluble pellet when expressed with Oto (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006191-g003">Fig. 3d</xref>). Thus the Oto modification appears to be independent of C77 palmitoylation. We did not directly address the possible role of S209 in this study.</p><p>To measure the apparently novel hydrophobicity change in Wnt3a caused by Oto co-expression, we performed hydrophobic interaction chromatography (HIC) using butyl sepharose.

Insoluble material only, isolated from cells expressing full length Wnt3a or Oto&#x0002b;Wnt3a, was incubated with butyl sepharose. Insoluble material was prepared under reducing conditions in 1&#x00025; SDS immediately before incubation with hydrophobic matrix (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref> for details), which is likely to disrupt any pre-existing protein interactions. Bound proteins were eluted from the matrix with the mild non-ionic detergent Triton X100 (TX100), or with denaturing SDS. While a significant quantity of Wnt3a alone elutes with TX100, the majority of Oto-modified Wnt3a requires SDS for elution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006191-g003">Fig. 3e</xref>). Under these conditions, the Oto protein elutes in a distinct peak from Oto-modified Wnt3a (not shown), indicating that Oto and Wnt3a bound to the matrix independently. These data reveal that Oto-modified Wnt3a is intrinsically more hydrophobic than Wnt3a itself.</p><p>Although Oto-modified Wnt3a migrates more slowly than naked Wnt3a, it is not glycosylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006191-g003">Fig. 3c</xref>); its signal peptide has been cleaved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006191-g004">Fig. 4a</xref>); and its formation is independent of N-glycosylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006191-g004">Fig. 4b</xref>).

As a separate point, some loss of activity likely resulted from the nature of the Wnt1 protein; Wnts produced endogenously are hydrophobic due to porcupine-mediated lipidations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006191-Zhai1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006191-Galli1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006191-Takada1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref> and tend to stick to plastic surfaces in the absence of detergents, causing losses during pipetting, storage, and general handling. To eliminate this potential source of variability, we adopted a co-culture approach, in which Wnt-producing M14 cells were plated together with responding cells. This approach did yield much higher Wnt activity readings than the CM method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006191-g010">Fig. 10c</xref>), but did not eliminate variability in the Wnt response elicited by shoto cells.

We addressed this by co-transfecting mammalian gpi-specific phospholipase D (GPI-PLD) with Wnt1 alone or with Oto&#x0002b;Wnt1, and then examined the consequences on Wnt secretion.

This study and ours support the idea that Oto/PGAP1 can function both as a gpi deacylase and as a regulator of Wnt signaling. We further show that overexpression of Oto leads to a dramatic increase in the hydrophobicities of co-expressed Wnt3a and Wnt1. Oto modification may extend to other Wnts, given the high degree of protein conservation in this family, and the widespread expression of <italic>oto</italic> in embryos and adults. Our preliminary results indicate that Wnt5a is also Oto-modifiable (not shown). Gpi-anchoring by the widely expressed Oto protein likely contributes to explaining why Wnts are poorly secreted by mammalian cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006191-Burrus1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The characterizations reported here show that the hydrophobic modifications on Wnt3a and Wnt1 have the hallmarks of gpi anchors. While the appended moiety itself is clearly a chemical relative of the conventional gpi anchor, the process by which the protein is modified is apparently unrelated. For instance, a conventional gpi anchored protein is produced by a transamidation reaction in which the carboxy terminus of the protein is cleaved and replaced with the gpi anchor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006191-Eisenhaber1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>. In the case of Oto-modified Wnt3a and Wnt1, the carboxy termini remain intact, and the gpi-like anchor is attached internally by an as yet undefined reaction mechanism (unpublished observations). Furthermore, a conventional gpi anchor allows its linked protein to become tethered to the plasma membrane via its anchor lipids, after the protein has exited the secretory pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006191-Mayor1">&#x0005b;70&#x0005d;</xref>. Despite our careful analysis, gpiWnts have not been detected on the plasma membrane. Instead, our immunolocalization and enzymatic analyses indicate that gpiWnt accumulates and lingers in the ER in an immature, hydrophobic state. Further studies are necessary to determine the site of gpi anchorage in Wnts, although these studies are not at all trivial given the extreme hydrophobicities of Wnts 1 and 3a, which are not only gpi-linked, but covalently modified by at least two other lipids as well <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006191-Willert1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006191-Galli1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006191-Takada1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Others have shown that porcupine is responsible for adding palmitic acid and palmitoleic acid to Wnt3a at C77 and S209 respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006191-Willert1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006191-Galli1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006191-Takada1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Our data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006191-g003">Figure 3</xref> indicate that the Oto modification continues to be added to Wnt3a when C77 is deleted. Our subsequent data show that the Oto modification is a gpi-like anchor. These results demonstrate that the Oto modification does not depend on porcupine's modification of C77, and further that the hydrophobic groups added by porcupine and Oto are distinct in nature. Moreover, these results raise the possibility that the Oto modification proceeds independently of porcupine, although to prove this unequivocally, we would have to mutate S209 also. Alternatively, although Oto and porcupine add different lipid groups to Wnts, it is possible that Oto and porcupine have competitive or synergistic effects during Wnt production.</p><p>While the sites of porcupine modification are known, we do not know the sites of gpi anchor addition in Wnts 1 and 3a, and our preliminary work indicates that this is a complex problem. We therefore devised an alternative way to assay the function of the Wnt gpi anchor in Wnt secretion. Rather than preventing anchoring through site specific mutagenesis and then testing the effect on Wnt secretion, we asked the cell to remove the anchor by cotransfecting Oto and Wnt1 with GPI-PLD. If the gpi anchor mediates Wnt retention, then cleaving anchor lipids should release it and allow the protein to proceed through the secretory pathway. The GPI-PLD experiment supports the idea that cleavage of anchor lipids relieves ER retention (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006191-g010">Fig. 10d,e</xref>). These data in turn suggest that a major role of anchor lipids may be to retain Wnts in the ER via tethering to the ER membrane. Although we have not proved that GPI-PLD cleaves lipids from gpiWnt1 directly, our results are consistent with this conclusion, and are supported by the observation that PI-PLC, the bacterial equivalent of GPI-PLD, cleaves anchor lipids from Oto-modified Wnt3a <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006191-g007">Fig. 7c</xref>). The detected Oto/Wnt association may contribute to Wnt retention as well. Alternatively or in addition, under Oto-abundant conditions another step may be necessary to release Wnt1 from the ER in a maximal way, such as degradation or inactivation of the Oto protein.</p><p>By contrast, our finding that extracellular levels of NShh are not changed by GPI-PLD co-expression suggests that NShh is not modified by gpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006191-g010">Fig. 10e</xref>). Similarly, preliminary Oto/NShh and gfp/NShh co-expression experiments showed no apparent signs of NShh modification (not shown). The lack of evidence for NShh modification thus far suggests that the enhancing effect of GPI-PLD on Wnt1 secretion is due to the specific action of GPI-PLD on gpi-linked proteins, and not to a general effect on all secretory proteins. Additionally, the greatest augmentation in extracellular Wnt1 levels was observed in cells not cotransfected with Oto (i.e., gfp/Wnt1/PLD cells). Importantly, this suggests that Wnt1 is modified endogenously in the 293 cell line. Accordingly, the 42 kDa insoluble Wnt1 isoform was occasionally seen on Western blots of insoluble material from control gfp/Wnt1 transfected 293 cells (not shown). In preliminary studies, we have found evidence for endogenous gpi-anchored Wnt1 in untransfected M14 melanoma cells as well (JSZ unpublished), which express high levels of Wnt1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006191-Su1">&#x0005b;66&#x0005d;</xref>. Detection of gpiWnt1 in endogenous settings strongly suggests that Oto-dependent gpi anchoring of Wnts has a genuine role in the cell, and is not an artifact of overexpression.</p><p>We speculate that Oto-dependent gpi anchoring provides a mechanism for accumulating Wnt proteins as gpi-linked isoforms within Wnt producing cells for release at a later, regulated time point. In such a hypothetical scenario, Oto/Wnt co-expressing cells would generate a supply of Wnt held in reserve in the ER via gpi anchoring. An endogenous gpi-phospholipase would then remove anchor lipids from Wnt to trigger resumption of Wnt maturation, thereby yielding a regulated burst of Wnt ligands. When <italic>oto</italic> is lacking however, our evidence suggests that Wnts travel through the secretory system in a relatively uninhibited manner. In shRNA-mediated <italic>oto</italic>-deficient 293 and M14 cells, significantly more soluble Wnt1 is secreted into the media during a set time compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006191-g010">Fig. 10a</xref>). In M14 <italic>oto</italic> knockdown cells, secreted Wnt1 is also highly active (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006191-g010">Fig. 10b,c</xref>). These data indicate that Wnt ligands secreted by <italic>oto</italic>-deficient cells are mature, active, and greater in quantity due to reduced Oto-mediated ER retention. We were not able to look directly at ER localization of Wnts in embryos. To our knowledge, antibodies that detect mammalian Wnt proteins at endogenous expression levels have not yet been generated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006191-Nusse2">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The <italic>oto</italic> mutant phenotype is consistent with our biochemical studies. In <italic>oto</italic>-deficient embryos, Wnt signaling in the Wnt1 domain of the neural plate is detected earlier than normal, at 1&#x02013;2 somites. In the context of our biochemical results, the simplest explanation is that active Wnt1 is secreted prematurely in the mutant due to decreased Oto-mediated ER retention. In <italic>oto</italic> mutants, the domain of Wnt activity in the medial neural plate is similar in size and area to that seen in older wildtype embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006191-g009">Fig. 9i,j</xref>). But importantly, in the mutant the Wnt activity domain is in the context of a neural plate that is smaller overall. Consequently, the area allocated to develop as forebrain is smaller than normal. Therefore the <italic>oto</italic> neural plate resembles an ectopic Wnt situation, in which the medial Wnt domain overlaps the posterior region of the forebrain competence zone. Moreover, at 1&#x02013;2 somites when we detect premature Wnt1 activity in <italic>oto</italic> mutants, studies show that murine neurectoderm is uncommitted and labile enough to be respecified with regard to fate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006191-Shimamura1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus the relatively large area of Wnt activity in <italic>oto</italic> neurectoderm is expected to posteriorize the anterior neural plate, resulting in loss of forebrain cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006191-g001">Fig. 1d&#x02013;h</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006191-Zoltewicz1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Posteriorization of the <italic>oto</italic> forebrain may occur by two possible mechanisms. First, the Wnt activity visualized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006191-g009">Fig. 9j</xref> does not cover the anteriormost neural plate, suggesting that anteriormost cells may not directly experience Wnt signaling in <italic>oto</italic>. In this case, posteriorization of the <italic>oto</italic> forebrain may occur by means of a second signal, a relay mechanism. Or, a Wnt activity gradient may extend all the way to the anterior in <italic>oto</italic>, with the lowest levels of the gradient falling below the level of detection. Although there are precendents for morphogenetic signals being propagated by relay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006191-Bischoff1">&#x0005b;71&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006191-Ishibashi1">&#x0005b;72&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006191-Reilly1">&#x0005b;73&#x0005d;</xref>, the Wnt gradient mechanism seems more apt.

Alternatively, another as yet unidentified Wnt may also be involved, although if so, the activity of this other putative Wnt would be reflected in the BAT-gal readout.</p><p>Placing our results in a molecular context, the earliest <italic>oto</italic> forebrain defect was detected at 2&#x02013;3 somites, when <italic>hesx1</italic> expression is reduced in the anterior neurectoderm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006191-Zoltewicz1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>.

In these latter mutants however, the primary defect is loss of the Wnt-repressive effects of Hesx1 or Six3, which then allows derepression of Wnt1 in anterior neural cells. In the <italic>oto</italic> case, our data indicate the reverse, and suggest the primary <italic>oto</italic> defect is prematurely robust Wnt activity in the Wnt1 domain, which then represses <italic>hesx1</italic> by encroaching upon its domain from the posterior direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006191-g009">Fig. 9k</xref>). Our combined biochemical and phenotypic results support the following interpretation of <italic>oto</italic> forebrain defects. Decreased ER retention of Wnt1 in <italic>oto</italic>-deficient neurectoderm leads to premature Wnt signaling in the Wnt1 domain; in the younger, smaller <italic>oto</italic> neural plate, this Wnt activity covers too much of the anterior neural region, repressing <italic>hesx1</italic> expression and curtailing anterior neural development.</p><p>While it is possible that dysregulation of other secreted proteins may contribute to <italic>oto</italic> forebrain defects, the salient premature neurectodermal Wnt activity in the <italic>oto</italic> mutant is likely to be the major factor contributing to the forebrain deficit, given the demonstrated potency of Wnts in mediating neural posteriorization in vertebrates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006191-FekanyLee1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006191-Lagutin1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006191-Kim1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006191-Yamamoto1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006191-Popperl1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006191-Nambiar1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006191-vandeWater1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006191-Andoniadou1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006191-Houart1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006191-Onai1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006191-Mukhopadhyay1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006191-Satoh1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006191-Jeong1">&#x0005b;78&#x0005d;</xref>.
