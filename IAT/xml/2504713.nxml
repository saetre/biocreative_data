It is a marker of regulatory T cells (Tr), which often carry Nrp1 and latency-associated peptide (LAP)-TGF-&#x003b2;1 (the latent form). The signaling TGF-&#x003b2;1 receptors bind only active TGF-&#x003b2;1, and we hypothesized that Nrp1 binds the latent form. Indeed, we found that Nrp1 is a high-affinity receptor for latent and active TGF-&#x003b2;1. Free LAP, LAP-TGF-&#x003b2;1, and active TGF-&#x003b2;1 all competed with VEGF<sub>165</sub> for binding to Nrp1. LAP has a basic, arginine-rich C-terminal motif similar to VEGF and peptides that bind to the b1 domain of Nrp1. A C-terminal LAP peptide (QSSRHRR) bound to Nrp1 and inhibited the binding of VEGF and LAP-TGF-&#x003b2;1. We also analyzed the effects of Nrp1/LAP-TGF-&#x003b2;1 coexpression on T cell function. Compared with Nrp1<sup>&#x02013;</sup> cells, sorted Nrp1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells had a much greater capacity to capture LAP-TGF-&#x003b2;1. Sorted Nrp1<sup>&#x02013;</sup> T cells captured soluble Nrp1-Fc, and this increased their ability to capture LAP-TGF-&#x003b2;1. Conventional CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD25<sup>&#x02013;</sup>Nrp1<sup>&#x02013;</sup> T cells coated with Nrp1-Fc/LAP-TGF-&#x003b2;1 acquired strong Tr activity. Moreover, LAP-TGF-&#x003b2; was activated by Nrp1-Fc and also by a peptide of the b2 domain of Nrp1 (RKFK; similar to a thrombospondin-1 peptide). Breast cancer cells, which express Nrp1, also captured and activated LAP-TGF-&#x003b2;1 in a Nrp1-dependent manner. Thus, Nrp1 is a receptor for TGF-&#x003b2;1, activates its latent form, and is relevant to Tr activity and tumor biology.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>binding motif</kwd><kwd>VEGF</kwd><kwd>LAP-TGF-&#x003b2;1</kwd><kwd>signal transduction</kwd><kwd>CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD25<sup>&#x02013;</sup></kwd><kwd>T lymphocytes</kwd><kwd>suppressor cells</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Neuropilin-1 (Nrp1) is a multifunctional protein involved in axonal guidance through its ability to bind the chemorepulsive class 3 semaphorin (SEMA3) proteins and angiogenesis through its interactions with vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family members (including VEGF<sub>165</sub>) and their receptors (VEGFR1 and VEGFR2) &#x0005b;<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x0005d;.

In DCs, it is found at the immunologic synapse, but no definitive function has yet been attached to its expression by Tr cells. Interestingly, Tr cells frequently bear latency-associated peptide (LAP)-TGF-&#x003b2;1, i.e., the latent form of this cytokine, and this appears to contribute to their suppressive activity in some settings &#x0005b;<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x0005d;. The classical TGF-&#x003b2;1 receptors (TGF-&#x003b2;RI, -RII, and -RIII) bind only the active (mature) form of TGF-&#x003b2;1, and other receptors must be involved. Indeed, arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD)-binding integrins &#x0005b;<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x0005d; and the mannose-6-phosphate/insulin-like growth factor II receptor (M6P/IGFII-R) &#x0005b;<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x0005d; can bind LAP-TGF-&#x003b2;1. However, these receptors appear be more relevant to DCs or macrophages and to our knowledge, have not been reported on Tr cells. We hypothesized that Nrp1 might be a receptor for LAP-TGF-&#x003b2;1, and indeed, we found that Nrp1-Fc (but not Fc) bound LAP-TGF-&#x003b2;1 and active TGF-&#x003b2;1 at high affinity. Interestingly, LAP-TGF-&#x003b2; competed with VEGF for binding to Nrp1-Fc and appeared to bind at the same site. Nrp1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells, unlike Nrp1<sup>&#x02013;</sup> T cells, captured LAP efficiently. Conventional CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD25<sup>&#x02013;</sup>Nrp1<sup>&#x02013;</sup> T cells could be coated with Nrp1-Fc, which promoted the capture of LAP-TGF-&#x003b2;1 and imparted regulatory activity to these cells. Importantly, we found that Nrp1 activates LAP-TGF-&#x003b2;1, and this can occur on the membrane of Nrp1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> tumor cells. Thus, our study reveals that Nrp1 is a TGF-&#x003b2;1 receptor, which is relevant to immune regulation and tumor biology.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Mice</title><p>Experiments were performed with the T cells of CD-1 and C57BL/6 mice (Charles River, Wilmington, MA, USA).</p></sec><sec><title>Nrp1-Fc, Fc, and peptides</title><p>Recombinant rat Nrp1, conjugated to an Fc fragment of human IgG1 (Nrp1-Fc), was purchased from R&#x00026;D Systems (Minneapolis, MN, USA).

Nonspecific binding was determined in wells treated with the blocking solution and specific antibody and subtracted from the OD for total binding to give the values of specific binding.

Heparin was not required for binding and prevented the binding of LAP but not TGF-&#x003b2;1. The cytokines IL-2 and IFN-&#x003b3; did not bind to Nrp1-Fc (not shown). Active or latent TGF-&#x003b2;1 did not bind to immobilized Fc, and soluble Fc did not compete with soluble TGF-&#x003b2;1 for binding to immobilized Nrp1-Fc. No binding of any TGF-&#x003b2;1 components was noted when Nrp1-Fc was replaced by OVA, aprotinin, leupeptin, and a number of unrelated peptides (data not shown). To confirm specificity, we also performed blocking experiments with antibodies. Soluble LAP, when mixed with soluble Nrp1-Fc, competed with plate-bound LAP and decreased Nrp1-Fc retention on the plate (data not shown). Pretreatment of immobilized LAP with neutralizing concentrations of anti-LAP antibodies but not control antibody blocked the binding of soluble Nrp1-Fc to LAP <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">(Fig. 1D)</xref>.</p><p>Binding affinities were determined under equilibrium conditions by ELISA.

Strong positive cooperativity was observed for LAP (n<sub>H</sub>&#x0003d;2.9) and LAP-TGF-&#x003b2;1 (n<sub>H</sub>&#x0003d;3.7) binding to Nrp1-Fc (but not for TGF-&#x003b2;1 binding), suggesting that LAP binds to three or more interacting sites on the Nrp1-Fc molecule <xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">(Fig. 1B)</xref>. To exclude possible effects of immobilization, we also measured reactant concentrations in soluble mixtures after filtration through Millipore filters with the molecular cut-off permitting separation of the unbound from the bound components. We also examined other variations of the assay (ELISA of the unbound instead of the retained ligands; immobilization of the ligand instead of the receptor protein).

Thus, LAP was expressed by 40% of sorted CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>Nrp1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells, and FoxP3 and CD25 were expressed at a slightly lower frequency. When we incubated sorted CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>Nrp1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells with free LAP, we observed that they captured LAP, such that &#x0223c;95% became LAP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, and this was blocked by an anti-Nrp1 mAb <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">(Fig. 3F)</xref>. In contrast, few sorted Nrp1<sup><bold>&#x02013;</bold></sup> T cells captured LAP <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">(Fig. 3F)</xref>. Indeed, we found that the latter cells captured LAP poorly, unless they were precoated with Nrp1-Fc (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3G</xref>; in accord with the results of <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3B</xref> with unsorted T cells), and LAP-TGF-&#x003b2;1 binding to Nrp1-Fc-coated T cells was inhibited by anti-Nrp1 mAb <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">(Fig. 3G)</xref>. These flow cytometry results, especially the blockade of binding by anti-Nrp1 antibodies, support the conclusion that Nrp1 is a LAP-TGF-&#x003b2;1 receptor. Unsorted T cells incubated with active TGF-&#x003b2;1 captured this cytokine (they have receptors for the active form), but even in this case, preincubation of cells with Nrp1-Fc moderately increased the number of TGF-&#x003b2;<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells <xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">(Fig. 3H)</xref>, consistent with the ability of Nrp1 to also bind the mature cytokine.</p></sec><sec><title>Nrp1 activates LAP-TGF-&#x003b2;1</title><p>When T cells were activated with anti-CD3 mAb, proliferation and IL-2 production were suppressed by active TGF-&#x003b2;1 (at &#x02264;2 pM; not shown).

The ability of Nrp1 to activate latent TGF-&#x003b2;1 was further confirmed by our finding that coincubating LAP-TGF-&#x003b2;1 with immobilized Nrp1-Fc in a cell-free system resulted in the exposure of an epitope recognized by1D11 <xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">(Fig. 4D)</xref>.

The untreated CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD25<sup>&#x02013;</sup> cells and single-treated cells (with Nrp1-Fc or LAP-TGF-&#x003b2;1) were not suppressive or exerted only weak suppression, but the double-coated T cells (Nrp1-Fc/LAP-TGF-&#x003b2;1-treated) strongly suppressed proliferation of the Te cells (<xref rid="F6" ref-type="fig"><bold>Fig. 6, A</bold> and <bold>B</bold></xref>).

This is supported by several findings, including coprecipitation assays, cell-free ELISA-binding assays, competition with VEGF (a well-known Nrp1 ligand), use of blocking antibodies, flow cytometry data, and T cell functional assays. The binding affinities of Nrp1 for TGF-&#x003b2;1 components (LAP, LAP-TGF-&#x003b2;1, and TGF-&#x003b2;1) were notably high. These high affinities likely depend on prominent avidity effects as a result of the homodimeric structure of Nrp1-Fc and the target ligands, as shown, for example, for VEGFR2 &#x0005b;<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x0005d;. It appears that Nrp1 frequently exists as a dimer or oligomer on cell membranes &#x0005b;<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x0005d;, and therefore, similar high-affinity binding can probably occur in vivo. LAP binding to Nrp1, unlike VEGF &#x0005b;<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x0005d;, is not enhanced by heparin but rather is blocked.</p><p>Crystal structure studies of the b1 and b2 domains of Nrp1 &#x0005b;<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x0005d; provide possible explanations of how Nrp1 binds several seemingly unrelated ligands. Lee et al. &#x0005b;<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x0005d; described a cleft with a negative charge within the b1 domain and postulated that positively charged C-terminal tails of VEGF and SEMA3 bind to this site. Vander Kooi et al. &#x0005b;<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x0005d; reported similar findings and demonstrated that Tuftsin (TKPR), a peptide mimic of the C-terminal of VEGF<sub>165</sub> (KPRR), binds to this cleft of the b1 domain. The terminal arginine residue of Tuftsin appears to be particularly important in this interaction. von Wronski et al. &#x0005b;<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x0005d; showed that Tuftsin competes with VEGF<sub>165</sub> for binding to Nrp1. Of note, a viral VEGF-like protein that binds Nrp1 has a C-terminal TRPPRRRR sequence &#x0005b;<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x0005d;. In contrast, a splice variant of VEGF<sub>165</sub> with a SLTRKD C-terminal sequence fails to bind Nrp1 &#x0005b;<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x0005d;. In addition, other ligands or peptides that bind to Nrp1 are characterized by a basic structure and often two or more arginine residues &#x0005b;<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x0005d;. As LAP has a highly basic, arginine-rich C-terminal motif (<bold>RHRR</bold>), we hypothesized that it binds to Nrp1 through this domain and tested some peptide interactions. A LAP C-terminal peptide (QSS<bold>RHRR</bold>) bound Nrp1, although with lower affinity than LAP, and blocked the binding of VEGF and LAP-TGF-&#x003b2;1. Unlike VEGF, the binding of LAP was not blocked completely. Taken together, these observations are indicative of participation of the C-terminal LAP peptide in the binding LAP to Nrp1 but do not exclude the possibility that there are other binding sites, especially as LAP binding was not blocked completely.</p><p>In the case of active TGF-&#x003b2;1, there is no similar C-terminal sequence, and binding presumably occurs through other interactions that have not yet been characterized. However, crystal structure studies of TGF-&#x003b2;3 and TGF-&#x003b2;RII complexes &#x0005b;<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>&#x0005d; show that TGF-&#x003b2;3 has two arginine-containing, finger-like structures that interact with the RII receptor. In particular, the RII-binding site has an electronegative area, where D32 interacts with R94 of a TGF-&#x003b2;3 finger &#x0005b;<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>&#x0005d;. TGF-&#x003b2;1 differs from TGF-&#x003b2;3 by only one amino acid in that segment and is presumably capable of similar interactions. In preliminary studies, we found that a basic peptide encompassing R94 of TGF-&#x003b2;1 (peptide VG<bold>RKPK</bold>V) interfered with the binding of mature TGF-&#x003b2; and VEGF to Nrp1 (data not shown). In view of this, we speculate that the TGF-&#x003b2; finger structure that binds to RII might also bind to the electronegative pocket of the b1 domain of Nrp1. It is interesting that this peptide did not have a C-terminal arginine residue, but in some cases, this may not be required as shown, for example, by the binding of cyclic arginine-containing peptides to Nrp1 &#x0005b;<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x0005d;. Interestingly, the sequence <sup>94</sup><bold>RKPK</bold> of TGF-&#x003b2;1 has been identified as a binding site to LAP, and remarkably, the RKPK peptide activated LAP-TGF-&#x003b2;1 &#x0005b;<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>&#x0005d;. This peptide has obvious similarity with the basic peptides of Nrp1 (RKFK) and TSP-1 (KRFK), which also activate LAP-TGF-&#x003b2;1, as discussed below.</p><p>Flow cytometry analysis revealed that only 3&#x02013;4% of splenic T cells were Nrp1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, and almost all were CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells, and they frequently coexpressed Tr markers (CD25, FoxP3, and LAP). However, these markers do not completely overlap, and there is obvious heterogenitiy in the Nrp1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell population. By multicolor flow cytometry, we observed that 60% of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD25<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells coexpress Nrp1 and LAP. In addition, 10&#x02013;12% of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD25<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>Nrp1<sup>&#x02013;</sup> T cells also expressed LAP, suggesting that Nrp1 is not the only LAP receptor on the membrane of these T cells. Approximately 45% of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD25<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells coexpressed Nrp1 and FoxP3, and interestingly, the Nrp1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells expressed FoxP3 cells at a higher level than the Nrp1<sup>&#x02013;</sup> T cells. This finding is similar to the report of Battaglia et al. &#x0005b;<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x0005d;, who studied human Nrp1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> Tr cells. Thus, Nrp1 expression appears to correlate with high FoxP3 expression in mice and humans. Approximately 40% of sorted CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>Nrp1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells expressed LAP, but when these cells were incubated with soluble LAP, &#x0223c;95% became LAP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, revealing a high capacity to capture this component. The binding of LAP was blocked by an anti-Nrp1 antibody, showing this was a Nrp1-dependent interaction. In contrast, Nrp1<sup>&#x02013;</sup> T cells only had a minimal ability to capture LAP, but this was considerably increased by precoating these cells with Nrp1-Fc. It is noteworthy that the blockade of other known receptors of LAP such as RGD-binding integrins and M6P/IGFII-R did not reduce the binding of LAP in our experiments (data not shown). Taken together, our results indicate that Nrp1 is the major LAP receptor of T cells, although it is not the only LAP receptor. The nature of other receptors has not been elucidated.</p><p>No definite role has yet been ascribed to Nrp1 in Tr cell-suppressive activity. Indeed, antibodies against Nrp1 did not alter the suppressive activity of natural Tr cells &#x0005b;<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x0005d;. However, we hypothesized that Nrp1 might play a role by capturing LAP-TGF-&#x003b2;1 and contributing to its activation on the cell membrane. There is a precedent for this, as other molecules can activate latent TGF-&#x003b2;1 on the membrane of some cells &#x0005b;<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>&#x0005d;. First, we found that the coincubation of soluble Nrp1-Fc and LAP-TGF-&#x003b2;1 resulted in activation of the cytokine, as measured by suppression of HT-2 cells or normal T cells. Although the mechanism of TGF-&#x003b2;1 activation remains to be elucidated, it is striking that Nrp1 possesses a short basic sequence (RKFK) in its b2 domain, closely similar to a sequence of TSP-1 (KRFK or RFK) that binds LAP in its N-terminal portion and activates latent TGF-&#x003b2;1 by inducing a conformational change &#x0005b;<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x0005d;. Importantly, the RKFK sequence of Nrp1 has been linked to heparin binding &#x0005b;<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x0005d; and cell aggregation &#x0005b;<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>&#x0005d; and is evidently exposed for molecular interactions. We compared the RKFK and KRFK peptides and found that they are equally effective at activating latent TGF-&#x003b2;1. Although further studies are required, this suggests that the RKFK sequence of Nrp1 represents another binding site for LAP and by analogy, with TSP-1 &#x0005b;<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x0005d;, provides an important clue as to how it might activate LAP-TGF-&#x003b2;1. Indeed, our binding studies suggest more than one site for interaction of LAP with Nrp1. Interestingly, the RKFK sequence is present in Nrp1 and Nrp2 of the rat, mouse, and human &#x0005b;<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Most malignant tumor cells express Nrp1 and/or Nrp2 &#x0005b;<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x0005d;, and it was of interest to see whether this influences LAP-TGF-&#x003b2;1 capture. We investigated this question with MDA-MB-231 human breast cancer cells, which are strongly Nrp1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>. These cells captured LAP-TGF-&#x003b2;1, and LAP staining was greatly reduced by an anti-Nrp1 antibody, although some weak staining persisted, perhaps because of another receptor(s). Importantly, LAP-TGF-&#x003b2;1 was activated, as demonstrated by increased nuclear p-Smad2 expression, and this was almost completely blocked by an anti-Nrp1 antibody. The generation of p-Smad2 is strong evidence of the induction TGF-&#x003b2;1 signaling, and this is a Nrp1-dependent process. As expected, a TGF-&#x003b2;RI (ALK5) inhibitor, SD-208, also blocked signaling in this pathway.</p><p>To demonstrate an effect on T cell activity, we coated conventional (nonsuppressive) CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD25<sup>&#x02013;</sup>Nrp1<sup>&#x02013;</sup> cells with Nrp1-Fc and LAP-TGF-&#x003b2;1 and tested their activity in a Tr cell assay (inhibition of CD3-mediated T cell proliferation). Of note, Nrp1-Fc binds to the membrane of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells, as well as tumor cell lines (data not shown). The receptors responsible for this interaction have not been characterized. However, as Nrp1 binds to several molecules commonly expressed on cell membranes (e.g., VEGF receptors, cMET, &#x003b2;1 integrin, galectin-1), it seems likely that several receptors are capturing soluble Nrp1. Single-treated CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD25<sup>&#x02013;</sup>Nrp1<sup>&#x02013;</sup> cells (with Nrp1-Fc or LAP-TGF-&#x003b2;1) exerted minimal or no suppression, and double-coated T cells were strongly suppressive. Furthermore, this suppression was almost completely reversed by the 1D11 anti-TGF-&#x003b2; mAb, indicating that activated TGF-&#x003b2;1 was involved. We conclude that Nrp1 captured and activated TGF-&#x003b2;1 and through this mechanism, converted Te cells into Tr cells. As TGF-&#x003b2;1 is secreted primarily in the LAP-bound, latent form, which is present in plasma and tissues, it seems likely that Nrp1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells will acquire LAP-TGF-&#x003b2;1 in vivo, although not all were LAP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>. We speculate that Nrp1 allows T cells to capture and maintain TGF-&#x003b2;1 in an active form on their membrane and exert Tr-like suppression. This could be because these T cells are induced by TGF-&#x003b2;1 to differentiate into Tr cells &#x0005b;<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>&#x0005d; or because membrane-bound TGF-&#x003b2;1 directly exerts suppression, as suggested by some authors &#x0005b;<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x0005d;. Under physiological conditions, the association of Nrp1 with the PDZ protein GIPC might be relevant. Nrp1 interacts with GIPC through a short C-terminal (cytoplasmic) sequence (SEA), and this segment is required for Nrp1-mediated angiogenesis &#x0005b;<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x0005d;. GIPC is a PDZ scaffold protein &#x0005b;<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>&#x0005d; and can link G-protein signaling pathways &#x0005b;<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>&#x0005d;. It is also intriguing that Nrp1 and the TGF-&#x003b2;RIII &#x0005b;<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>&#x0005d; have a GIPC-binding domain, and it is plausible that they interact through this cytoplasmic protein. However, in our experiments, Nrp1-Fc does not have the GIPC-binding domain, demonstrating that GIPC is not required for the enhancement of LAP-TGF-&#x003b2;1-suppressive activity, presumably as signaling occurs through the classical TGF-&#x003b2;Rs (RI, RII, RIII).</p><p>In our Tr cell assays, we artificially coated CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD25<sup>&#x02013;</sup> T cells with Nrp1-Fc, and the question arises whether these cells can express Nrp1 in vivo. With respect to this question, Bourbi&#x000e9;-Vaudaine et al. &#x0005b;<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>&#x0005d; showed that Nrp1 is transferred from DCs (which express Nrp1) to CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells during T cell/DC interactions by a process denoted trogocytosis. Interestingly, Nrp1 was not rapidly internalized, and Nrp1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells could capture VEGF<sub>165</sub> on their membrane. In this case, &#x0003e;60% of responding CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells became Nrp1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, and although we have not studied this question, we hypothesize that when TGF-&#x003b2;1 is abundant, this could duplicate the conditions of our Tr assay.</p><p>In conclusion, we present evidence that Nrp1 is a receptor for the latent and active forms of TGF-&#x003b2;1, activates the latent form, and promotes Tr activity. Nrp1-dependent TGF-&#x003b2;1 activation also occurred on the membrane of breast cancer cells, and this is of great interest, as Nrp1 and TGF-&#x003b2;1 have been linked to cancer progression &#x0005b;<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>&#x0005d;. Also of notable relevance to cancer, Nrp1 acts as a coreceptor in VEGF/VEGFR and HGF/cMet interactions and also binds fibroblast growth factor 2 and &#x003b2;1 integrin &#x0005b;<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x0005d;. This astonishing variety of interactions suggests that Nrp1 has a general function of capturing growth factors on the membrane of normal or tumor cells and enhancing signaling through several pathways. Perhaps this occurs in some cases through the incorporation of Nrp1 into multicomponent signalosomes &#x0005b;<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>&#x0005d; involved in these pathways, with the participation of scaffold proteins such as GIPC. TGF-&#x003b2;1 is produced primarily in latent form (unlike other cytokines), and in this case, Nrp1 has the additional capacity of activating the latent cytokine. Our studies point to novel interactions between Nrp1 and TGF-&#x003b2;1, which are potentially relevant to several biological processes such as angiogenesis, immune regulation, and tumor biology.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was supported by Ontario Institute for Cancer Research of the Province of Ontario (Canada), the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation International, the

(C and D) Splenic T cells were stained in four colors with antibodies against CD4, CD25, Nrp1, and LAP (C) or forkhead box P3 (FoxP3; D).

We tested suppression in a conventional Tr assay, where CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD25<sup>&#x02013;</sup> T cells (the Te cells) are activated by soluble CD3 mAb. Putative Ts cells were added to Te cells, and decreased proliferation is used as an indicator of suppression. (A) Nrp1-Fc-treated CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD25<sup>&#x02013;</sup> T cells and Fc-treated cells did not suppress proliferation (data represent 1:1 Ts:Te ratio). LAP-TGF-&#x003b2;1-treated T cells were weakly suppressive.
