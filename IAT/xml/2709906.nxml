The rise in type 2 diabetes is tightly connected with a dramatic increase in obesity, a major risk factor for the development of type 2 diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Most obese people have become insulin resistant but compensate for the enhanced insulin demand by increasing insulin secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In order to explore how beta cells increase mass under physiological conditions, it is important to stimulate beta cell expansion in vivo and in vitro. The pathology of type 2 diabetes comprises initial hyperinsulinaemia with, thereafter, a continuous decline in beta cell function in association with a progressive decrease in beta cell mass due to an increasing rate of beta cell apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. A previously described mechanism for glucose-induced beta cell apoptosis involves the production and secretion of interleukin-1&#x003b2; (IL-1&#x003b2;) by the beta cell itself [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], which is blocked by an anti-inflammatory cytokine and naturally occurring antagonist of interleukin-1&#x003b1; (IL-1&#x003b1;) and &#x003b2; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], the interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Similarly to IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-1Ra binds to type 1 and 2 IL-1 receptors (IL-1R1, IL-1R2), but lacks a second binding domain. IL-1Ra does not recruit the IL-1 receptor accessory protein, the second component of the receptor complex, and blocks IL-1R1 signalling. Endogenous production and secretion of IL-1Ra has been shown to limit inflammation and tissue damage.</p><p>Exogenous IL-1Ra protects against IL-1&#x003b2;-induced beta cell damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], counteracts low-dose-streptozotocin-induced diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and autoimmune diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Results from a clinical study show that IL-1Ra improves glycaemic control and beta cell function in patients with type 2 diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>The secretory mechanisms and those regulating changes of IL-1Ra are unknown. An increasing body of evidence suggests that IL-1&#x003b2;, as well as intracellular IL-1Ra, is secreted by a leaderless pathway via activation of the P2X<sub>7</sub> receptor (P2X<sub>7</sub>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]). P2X<sub>7</sub>, a member of the purinergic receptor family, is a G-protein-coupled ionotropic receptor for extracellular ATP that forms a pore in response to ligand stimulation, regulating cell permeability, cytokine release and apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The cytokine IL-1&#x003b2;, which lacks a leader signal sequence, does not follow the classic endoplasmic-reticulum-to-Golgi pathway of secretion. Its secretion is governed by P2X<sub>7</sub>-mediated pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. This raises a question about the mechanisms of its release; it has been demonstrated that it is secreted upon activation of P2X<sub>7</sub> receptors, leading to shedding of microvesicles that contain the cytokine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>The pore-forming ATP receptor P2X<sub>7</sub> is also responsible for IL-1Ra release in endothelial cells and macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Consequently, we hypothesised that P2X<sub>7</sub> could be involved in IL-1Ra release in beta cells. The work presented here evaluates an important role for P2X<sub>7</sub> in beta cells, not only for cytokine release but also for insulin release and apoptosis. We have found upregulation of P2X<sub>7</sub> in islets from obese individuals, while receptors were almost undetectable in type 2 diabetes. We then investigated whether P2X<sub>7</sub> is involved in the compensatory mechanisms of the beta cells in response to an increased insulin demand in insulin resistance.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p><bold>Animals</bold><italic>P2x7</italic> (also known as <italic>P2rx7</italic>)-knockout mice (B6.129P2-<italic>P2rx7</italic><sup><italic>tm1Gab</italic></sup>/J; P2X<sub>7</sub>-KO) backcrossed to C57BL/6 mice for ten generations and C57BL/6&#x000a0;J wild-type (WT) mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME, USA) at 4&#x000a0;weeks of age.

To analyse regulation of P2X<sub>7</sub> in vivo, we compared staining and production of P2X<sub>7</sub> in beta cells in pancreatic sections obtained at autopsy from both obese and lean non-diabetic individuals and patients with type 2 diabetes. Double immunostaining for P2X<sub>7</sub> and insulin (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>d) confirmed the presence of P2X<sub>7</sub> localised in the beta cells in human pancreatic sections from lean control patients (first row), which was highly upregulated in obese non-diabetic patients (second row). In contrast, in both lean (third row) and obese (fourth row) diabetic groups, P2X<sub>7</sub> was barely detectable; no islet P2X<sub>7</sub> receptors were found in any of the diabetic pancreases. <fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>P2X<sub>7</sub> is produced in beta cells, upregulated in obesity and decreased in diabetes. <bold>a</bold> Agarose gel of the PCR products P2X<sub>7</sub> and tubulin obtained using cDNA from isolated human islets that was pretested for insulin production; mRNA served as a negative control (&#x02212;).

This is based on the pore-forming character of P2X<sub>7</sub>; its activation leads to the formation of a pore that is passable to molecules up to 0.9&#x000a0;kDa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. YO-PRO-1 has been widely used to visualise P2X<sub>7</sub> activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], although YO-PRO-1 can also access the beta cell in the presence of membrane blebbing during apoptosis and is also used for the detection of apoptotic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Freshly isolated human islets plated on dishes coated with extracellular matrix were loaded with 10&#x000a0;&#x003bc;mol/l YO-PRO-1 10&#x000a0;min before receptor activation by addition of 100&#x000a0;&#x003bc;mol/l benzoyl ATP (BzATP). Within 5&#x000a0;min of exposure, YO-PRO-1 was taken up by 45&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;6.01% of the islet cells; this was inhibited by pre-incubation with the specific P2X<sub>7</sub> inhibitor KN-62, which has been demonstrated to block YO-PRO-1 uptake initiated by prolonged P2X<sub>7</sub> activation previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The ATP-degrading enzyme apyrase (a less specific inhibitor of P2X<sub>7</sub>) had similar effects on YO-PRO-1 uptake (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>a). These data show production of functional P2X<sub>7</sub> in islets.

Elevated glucose concentrations increased <italic>P2X7</italic> mRNA levels (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>e: 1.7-fold increase with 11.1&#x000a0;mmol/l glucose, 2.5-fold increase with 33.3&#x000a0;mmol/l glucose and 1.8-fold increase with palmitic acid, compared with control [untreated, with 5.5&#x000a0;mmol/l glucose], <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) after 10&#x000a0;min of exposure. This was confirmed by western blot analysis (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>f, g). Changes in mRNA level and protein production were detected within this short time, whereas values returned to basal after 24&#x000a0;h of exposure (not shown). Previous reports show that IL-1&#x003b2; induces increases in P2X<sub>7</sub> at 6&#x000a0;h, with levels decreasing after 48&#x000a0;h of treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. One explanation for the increase in P2X<sub>7</sub> within this narrow timeframe would be a rapid de novo synthesis of <italic>P2X7</italic> mRNA and P2X<sub>7</sub> protein, given weight by its relatively small size (595 amino acids/68&#x000a0;kDa).Recently, we have shown that IL-1Ra can protect from impaired beta cell function and death in vivo and in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The mechanisms of its secretion from the beta cell are unknown. We tested whether activation of P2X<sub>7</sub> leads to IL-1Ra secretion. Long-term glucose exposure had no effect on IL-1Ra secretion (data not shown and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]). But short-term (30&#x000a0;min) exposure of islets to elevated glucose, palmitic acid or BzATP induced IL-1Ra secretion, which was inhibited by KN-62 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>h). Analysis of insulin secretion in the same supernatant fractions showed similar regulation of insulin secretion. Elevated glucose levels (11.1 and 33.3&#x000a0;mmol/l), 0.5&#x000a0;mmol/l palmitic acid and 100&#x000a0;&#x003bc;mol/l BzATP induced insulin secretion, which was prevented by co-culture with KN-62 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>i).Regulation of IL-1Ra production by glucose and palmitic acid was confirmed by western blot analysis. Short-term exposure of human islets to elevated glucose and palmitic acid (30&#x000a0;min&#x02013;8&#x000a0;h) induced IL-1Ra secretion, whereas no differences were observed at 24&#x000a0;h treatment. These data indicate a parallel induction of IL-1Ra and P2X<sub>7</sub> in pancreatic islets.</p><p><bold>P2X<sub>7</sub>-deficient mice have impaired glucose tolerance, beta cell mass and function and fail to adapt IL-1Ra secretion to a high-fat diet</bold> The changes in P2X<sub>7</sub> activation in human islets in vitro were compared with glucose tolerance, beta cell survival and IL-1Ra secretion in the P2X<sub>7</sub>-KO mice.

As previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], high-fat feeding resulted in hyperglycaemia (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>b) as well as hyperinsulinaemia (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>c, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001) compared with control diet mice. Compared with mice consuming an ND, fasted insulin levels were 3.4-fold higher in HFD-fed WT mice and 5.7-fold higher in the P2X<sub>7</sub>-KO mice (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01). The HFD-fed WT mice had a much lower capacity to increase their glucose-stimulated insulin release (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>d, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01), whereas the P2X<sub>7</sub>-KO mice on the HFD completely failed to further increase their insulin levels in response to a glucose challenge (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>d, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001). P2X<sub>7</sub>-KO-ND mice had a 1.3-fold lower stimulatory index than the WT control mice (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05). These data indicate that P2X<sub>7</sub>-KO mice have an impaired beta cell function, which deteriorates under the challenge of an HFD treatment.To determine insulin sensitivity, we performed insulin tolerance tests by measuring glucose concentrations after intraperitoneal insulin injection of 0.5&#x000a0;U/kg body weight. Glucose levels from all mice were significantly higher at all time points during the IPITT compared with control wild-type mice on an ND (unchanged in P2X<sub>7</sub>-KO-ND at 120&#x000a0;min, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>e). To investigate whether the impaired glucose tolerance and insulin secretion was due to a defect in beta cell survival together with beta cell function, we analysed beta cell mass from the four groups after 12 and 16&#x000a0;weeks of treatment. As reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], after 12&#x000a0;weeks of diet, islet beta cell mass was increased by high-fat feeding in the WT mice compared with those on a normal diet (1.6-fold increase, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01; Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>f,g). In contrast, P2X<sub>7</sub>-KO mice had no such compensatory capacity in response to the HFD. There was no significant change in beta cell mass in the P2X<sub>7</sub>-KO mice fed the HFD compared with the P2X<sub>7</sub>-KO-ND mice. Moreover, beta cell mass was significantly decreased compared with the wild-type mice, independent of the diet (1.5-fold with ND and 1.5-fold with HFD, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0.01, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>f, g). This was confirmed after 16&#x000a0;weeks of diet. We have previously reported the tendency to beta cell apoptosis in mice after 12&#x000a0;weeks of HFD despite an increased beta cell mass at that time point [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Here, we analysed beta cell mass after 12 and 16&#x000a0;weeks of diet. In contrast to 12&#x000a0;weeks, there was no increase in beta cell mass in wild-type mice fed an HFD compared with ND-fed animals after 16&#x000a0;weeks. To investigate whether the changes in beta cell mass correlate with the increased rate of apoptosis, we analysed TUNEL-positive beta cells in pancreatic sections. After 16&#x000a0;weeks of diet, we observed a clear increase in beta cell apoptosis in the control HFD group. This was further increased in the P2X<sub>7</sub>-KO-HFD mice (1.5-fold raise in apoptosis in the WT-HFD and 11.2-fold in the P2X<sub>7</sub>-KO-HFD compared with ND controls, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>h). As P2X<sub>7</sub> regulates IL-1Ra secretion, we tested whether IL-1Ra levels are altered in P2X<sub>7</sub>-KO mice. The serum concentration of IL-1Ra was measured in WT and P2X<sub>7</sub>-KO mice during the 16&#x000a0;weeks of HFD feeding. In WT-ND mice, IL-1Ra levels were unchanged during the experiment. IL-1Ra levels were significantly lower in P2X<sub>7</sub>-KO-ND mice at 8, 12 and 16&#x000a0;weeks. Interestingly, after 4&#x000a0;weeks of diet, IL-1Ra increased 2.2-fold in the WT-HFD mice; these high levels were maintained at 8&#x000a0;weeks (1.9-fold compared with WT) and time-dependently decreased again after 12 and 16&#x000a0;weeks of diet (1.5-fold and 2.4-fold decrease from 8&#x000a0;weeks, respectively). After 16&#x000a0;weeks, IL-1Ra levels with HFD were lower than with the ND (2.6-fold decrease), which correlates with the changes in beta cell mass. P2X<sub>7</sub>-KO mice, which had beta cells unable to compensate via increasing beta cell mass, had no adaptive increase in IL-1Ra levels (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>i). We have also measured IL-1&#x003b2; serum levels together with IL-1Ra in the mouse studies. Unfortunately, the levels were very low and mostly under the lower level of the ELISA kit. Positive IL-1&#x003b2; readings were found for some but not all samples from the HFD-fed control mice at 12 and 16&#x000a0;weeks of diet, but none were found in the ND or P2X<sub>7</sub>-KO mice, making statistical data analysis not possible.</p><p><bold>Isolated islets from P2X<sub>7</sub>-deficient mice display a defect in insulin, IL-1Ra and IL-1&#x003b2; secretion</bold> As we observed impaired glucose tolerance and survival in the P2X<sub>7</sub>-deficient mice in vivo, we investigated whether impaired beta cell insulin secretion could explain this effect. Islets were isolated from all four treatment groups and insulin secretion into the culture medium was measured. Acute glucose-stimulated insulin secretion was abolished in islets derived from wild-type mice fed a high-fat diet and was further impaired in P2X<sub>7</sub>-KO-HFD mice (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>a). The stimulatory index (the ratio of stimulated to basal insulin secretion) was decreased 1.2-fold in the P2X<sub>7</sub>-KO-ND mice, 2.4-fold in the WT-HFD mice and 3.4-fold in the P2X<sub>7</sub>-KO-HFD mice compared with WT-ND control mice (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>b). These data confirm the impaired beta cell function in P2X<sub>7</sub>-KO mice from our in vivo studies on the level of isolated islets. We then incubated the islets for 8&#x000a0;h at 33.3&#x000a0;mmol/l glucose or 0.5&#x000a0;mmol/l palmitate. As expected, glucose and palmitate increased insulin secretion in the wild-type islets. In contrast, islets from P2X<sub>7</sub>-KO mice did not increase insulin secretion in response to the stimulation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>c). These data confirm the lack of stimulation of insulin secretion in the P2X<sub>7</sub>-KO mice. Under the same culture conditions, 72&#x000a0;h incubation of islets with 0.5&#x000a0;mmol/l palmitate increased IL-1Ra as well as IL-1&#x003b2; secretion from the wild-type but not the P2X<sub>7</sub>-KO islets (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>d). <fig id="Fig4"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;4</label><caption><p>Isolated islets from P2X<sub>7</sub>-deficient mice display a defect in insulin secretion. <bold>a</bold>, <bold>b</bold> For GSIS experiments, islets from all four treatment groups (WT-ND, WT-HFD, P2X<sub>7</sub>-KO-ND and P2X<sub>7</sub>-KO-HFD) were isolated after 12&#x000a0;weeks of diet and pre-cultured for 24&#x000a0;h on dishes coated with extracellular matrix. <bold>a</bold> Glucose-stimulated insulin secretion of islets.

In human obesity, P2X<sub>7</sub> is produced in large amounts, but is downregulated in pancreases obtained from patients with type 2 diabetes, in lean as well as in obese individuals. These data suggest that P2X<sub>7</sub> plays an important role in beta cell compensation. This is confirmed in our subsequent studies using P2X<sub>7</sub>-KO mice. These mice show impaired glucose tolerance and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion together with an increased number of apoptotic beta cells, which leads to a decrease in beta cell mass. When P2X<sub>7</sub>-KO mice were challenged with a diet enriched with fat and sucrose, they became severely glucose intolerant and were completely unable to upregulate insulin secretion in response to glucose during an IPGTT in vivo or a GSIS assay in vitro. Although they had increased basal insulin levels, which indicate an attempt to adapt for the higher insulin demand, they were unable to compensate by increasing beta cell mass during the diet. Beta cell mass adaptation is an important mechanism to maintain normoglycaemia in obese insulin-resistant individuals, in whom beta cell mass is almost doubled compared with lean individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Similar increases in beta cell mass in diet-induced obesity were measured in mice using a diet enriched with fat in a previous [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] or the present study. Interestingly, the high-fat/high-sucrose &#x02018;Surwit diet&#x02019; induces an early reduction in beta cell proliferation at a time point when beta cell mass is still increased [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], indicating a development towards fewer cells. This tendency is substantiated in the present study, where we show a decrease in beta cell mass with time together with an induction of beta cell apoptosis after 16&#x000a0;weeks of diet. In comparison, P2X<sub>7</sub>-KO mice show a higher apoptosis rate under the ND as well as under the HFD. The increase in basal insulin levels in response to the diet together with a defect in the compensation of beta cell mass indicates that, despite the lower beta cell mass, high amounts of insulin can be secreted. However, the functional failure is apparent in the abolished response to glucose stimulation. A complete loss of P2X<sub>7</sub> was also observed in the NOD mouse with manifest diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p><p>Little is known about the purinergic receptor family in the beta cell and the effects on insulin release are controversial. A low concentration of ATP stimulates insulin secretion via the metabotropic purinergic receptor subtype P2Y rather than via P2X receptors (the ionotropic selective cation channel receptors) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. P2X<sub>7</sub> was found in rat alpha but not beta cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], its production in human islets has not been studied before. Here, we show clearly the production and regulation of P2X<sub>7</sub> in the beta cell.</p><p>Fibroblasts from donors with type 2 diabetes have increased P2X<sub>7</sub>-mediated responses compared with non-diabetic donors, but levels of P2X<sub>7</sub> were unchanged [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In contrast, we report here a decrease in the level of P2X<sub>7</sub> in beta cells in type 2 diabetes. Consistent with the results from fibroblasts, P2X<sub>7</sub> activation was enhanced in isolated islets by a diabetic milieu (high glucose and palmitic acid), an effect prevented by P2X<sub>7</sub> inhibition. High glucose induces caspase 3 activation in beta cells as well as in fibroblasts. It is possible that beta cell P2X<sub>7</sub> receptors are activated and produced in high numbers at a time when IL-1Ra is highly secreted (e.g. in obesity) and when diabetes develops, levels are lowered in specific cells.</p><p>Our in vitro studies on isolated islets show that P2X<sub>7</sub> is directly involved in insulin secretion. Activation of P2X<sub>7</sub> by BzATP (which specifically targets P2X<sub>7</sub> receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]) or acute stimulation of insulin secretion by glucose or palmitic acid for 1&#x000a0;h resulted in insulin release that was partially inhibited by two P2X<sub>7</sub> inhibitors.</p><p>Although secretory pathways of insulin and IL-1Ra are distinct, one possible common step could be the calcium exchange; activation of P2X<sub>7</sub> increases intracellular calcium levels by calcium influx from the extracellular space. This leads to activation of the leaderless IL-1Ra-releasing pathway through pore formation. Increased intracellular calcium levels would also be a trigger for exocytosis of insulin-containing secretory granules.</p><p>High glucose can also activate P2X<sub>7</sub> in fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. In parallel, BzATP, glucose and palmitic acid induced short-term secretion of IL-1Ra, which was also inhibited by KN-62. Apyrase, a less specific P2X<sub>7</sub> inhibitor that affects the ligands of all P2X<sub>7</sub> receptors, showed similarities to the specific P2X<sub>7</sub> inhibitor KN-62 in blocking the effect of BzATP on islets, suggesting that P2X<sub>7</sub> is mainly activated by glucose and palmitic acid in islets.</p><p>Intracellular IL-1Ra has no signal peptide. A possible mechanism for release of intracellular IL-1Ra from the cells to bind to IL-1R1 is through vesicle shedding, which occurs through activation of the P2X<sub>7</sub> by ATP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Our data indicate that IL-1Ra secretion is an ATP-dependent process that requires P2X<sub>7</sub> activation. This may be how intracellular IL-1Ra, as well as IL-1&#x003b2;, is released from beta cells. Similar results are obtained from macrophages and endothelial cells, demonstrating that intracellular IL-1Ra and IL-1&#x003b2; are secreted by an extracellular ATP-dependent mechanism involving P2X<sub>7</sub> activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. We hypothesised that the balance of IL-1&#x003b2; and IL-1Ra is crucial for the onset of diabetes. P2X<sub>7</sub> receptors have a dual role in this system: they mediate the release of both pro-inflammatory IL-1&#x003b2; and anti-inflammatory IL-1Ra. From in vitro experiments we know that an excess of 10- to 1,000-fold IL-1Ra is needed to inhibit the IL-1&#x003b2; effects, dependent on the exposure time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. &#x00392;eta cell dysfunction and increased apoptosis may occur rapidly when IL-1Ra levels are decreased.</p><p>Corresponding with the levels of P2X<sub>7</sub>, increased IL-1Ra serum levels correlate with obesity and insulin resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>], whereas IL-1Ra is decreased in type 2 diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Recent results from the Whitehall II study show that IL-1Ra levels are increased before the onset of type 2 diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], which is consistent with our findings in mice fed with an HFD. The increase in IL-1Ra could be an attempt by the body to counteract the deleterious effects of IL-1&#x003b2; and to preserve beta cell survival, insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity. In contrast, it has been speculated that increased IL-1Ra could have an additional metabolic effect that leads to insulin resistance. This is not supported by our results, as daily IL-1Ra injections over 12&#x000a0;weeks did not impair insulin sensitivity in C57Bl/6 mice in a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], and increased IL-1Ra levels did not lead to changes in insulin sensitivity in the present study. As shown by the bell-shaped curve in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>i, decreased IL-1Ra levels occurred together with the increase in beta cell apoptosis and the development of diabetes in our study. It will now be important to determine whether long-standing type 2 diabetes leads to decreased IL-1Ra levels in humans in a follow-up study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="N0x1d1ea70N0x2d55fc8" content-type="local-data"><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material. </p><media xlink:href="125_2009_1349_MOESM1_ESM.pdf" id="MOESM1" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"><label>ESM 1</label><caption><p>(PDF 75.5 kb)</p></caption></media><media xlink:href="125_2009_1349_MOESM2_ESM.pdf" id="MOESM2" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"><label>ESM Table&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Clinical data from the autopsy study, results from which are shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>d (PDF 22.3 kb)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by the American Diabetes Association (Junior Faculty Grant 706JF41), the German Research Foundation (DFG, Emmy Noether Program, MA 4172/1-1) and the European Foundation for the Study of Diabetes (EFSD)/Merck Sharp &#x00026; Dohme.
