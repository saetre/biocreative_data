The goal of this study was to generate and characterize heterozygous and homozygous knockin-mice that carry a human STGD3 pathogenic mutation in the mouse <italic>Elovl4</italic> gene.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Recombinant Stgd3-knockin mice were generated using a DNA construct which introduced a pathogenic five-base pair deletion and two point mutations in exon 6 of the <italic>Elovl4</italic> gene. Stgd3-mouse genotypes were confirmed by Southern blot analysis and expression of wild-type (wt) and mutated Elovl4 mRNAs assayed by nuclease protection assay. The retinal phenotype of heterozygous Stgd3 mice was characterized by morphological studies, elecroretinographic (ERG) analysis and assay of lipofuscin accumulation. Homozygous Stgd3 mice were examined for both retinal and gross morphology. They were also analyzed for skin morphology and skin barrier function, and for epidermal lipid content using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) combined with mass spectrometry (MS).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The <italic>Stgd3</italic> allele codes for a truncated mouse Elovl4 protein, which also contains the same aberrant 8-amino acid C-terminus encoded by the human pathogenic STGD3 allele. Heterozygous Stgd3 mice expressed equal amounts of both wt and mutant Elovl4 mRNAs in the retina, showed no significant changes in retinal morphology, but did show accumulation of lipofuscin and reduced visual function. Homozygous Stgd3 mice were born with an expected Mendelian frequency, without any initial gross anatomical or behavioral abnormalities. By 6-12 h postpartum, they became dehydrated and died. A skin permeability assay detected a defect in epidermal barrier function. Homozygous mutant epidermis expressed a normal content of mutated Elovl4 mRNA and contained all four epidermal cellular layers. HPLC/MS analysis of epidermal lipids revealed the presence of all barrier lipids with the exception of the complete absence of acylceramides, the critical lipids for barrier function of the skin.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The generated Stgd3-knockin mice are a genetic model of human STGD3 and reproduce features of the human disease: accumulation of lipofuscin and reduced visual functions. Homozygous Stgd3 mice showed a complete absence of acylceramides from the epidermis. Their absence suggests a role for Elovl4 in acylceramide synthesis, and in particular, a role in the synthesis of the unique very long chain C30-C40 fatty acids present in skin acylceramides.</p></sec></abstract><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>GalleyStatus</meta-name><meta-value>Export to XML</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-wrap></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Three independent mutations in the gene coding elongase of very long chain fatty acids-4 (ELOVL4) have been shown to cause Stargardt disease-3 (STGD3), a juvenile-onset, autosomal dominant macular degeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>]. This hereditary disease is characterized by accumulation of lipofuscin and gradual loss of central vision [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>]. ELOVL4 is homologous with five other enzymes known to elongate very long chain fatty acids, but its substrate/product specificity and physiological role are currently unknown. All three human STGD3 pathogenic mutations lead to a truncated ELOVL4 protein deprived of its C-terminal sequence containing a signal for retention in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>].</p><p>In mammals, all fatty acids longer than 16 carbon atoms are either derived from dietary sources or are synthesized in the ER [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>]. The synthesis requires four enzymes to catalyze four consecutive reactions: condensation of a fatty acyl-CoA with malonyl-CoA, reduction of the resulting 3-ketoacyl-CoA, dehydration of the 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA to 2,3-enoylacyl-CoA followed by a final reduction step. The first and rate limiting step [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>] is catalyzed by elongase of very long chain fatty acids (Elovl). The six known mammalian elongases exhibit differential tissue expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>]. In addition to Elovl 1-6, DNA sequence in Genbank (Genbank accesion number <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.molvis.org/molvis/external.cgi?gbdna=BC005602">BC005602</ext-link>) suggests that there is a seventh member of the Elovl family which has similarity to Elovl1.</p><p>Three of the characterized enzymes elongate saturated fatty acids: Elovl1 synthesizes fatty acids with 26 carbon atoms (C26), Elovl3 elongates C16-C22 substrates and Elovl6 extends C12-C16 fatty acids. Polyunsaturated fatty acids, C20-C22, and C18-C20, are elongated by Elovl2 and Elovl5, respectively. Despite the use of similar approaches to those which led to successful identification of the substrates for the five characterized elongases, the substrate/product specificity of Elovl4 still remains unknown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>].</p><p>A role for ELOVL4 in the synthesis of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6n-3), which represents approximately 50% of the fatty acids in retinal outer segment phospholipids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>], has been proposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>]. DHA is synthesized from dietary essential linolenic acid (18:3n-3) in a series of three elongation steps [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>], but to date no evidence has been presented to define a role for ELOVL4 in this pathway. In addition to DHA, the retina also contains C24-C36 polyenoic fatty acids, present in photoreceptor outer segment phosphatidylcholines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>], which are synthesized from eicosapentaenoic acid (20:5n-3) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>]. Reduced retinal synthesis of very long chain fatty acids, such as DHA as well as C24-C36 polyenoic fatty acids, as a result of a mutated ELOVL4 could play a role in the pathogenesis of STGD3.</p><p>Both cell biology and animal model studies have been performed to try to understand the function of Elovl4. In vitro expression of an <italic>ELOVL4</italic> transgene with a five-bp STGD3 deletion showed translocation of the mutated protein out of the ER [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>]. When co-expressed, the mutant protein bound wt Elovl4 protein and carried it from the ER [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>]. These findings suggest that the STGD3 mutation has a dominant negative effect which might lead to reduction in the levels of the currently unidentified ELOVL4 lipid products.</p><p>Results from studies in three different animal models of STGD3 have been reported recently. Studies in transgenic mice expressing the mutant STGD3 form of ELOVL4 in photoreceptors showed lipofuscin accumulation, retinal degeneration and reduced ERG signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>], all features of human STGD3. In a second study, to address the physiological role of Elovl4, <italic>Elovl4-</italic>knockout mice were generated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>]. Retinas of heterozygous knockout mice demonstrated essentially normal retinal ERG function and minimal morphological abnormalities. The retinas of these mice had, however, a reduced content of several mono-unsaturated C16-C24 fatty acids. Homozygous knockout pups could not be obtained in this study. The third model reported is a heterozygous knock-in that introduced the five-bp STGD3 deletion in the mouse <italic>Elovl4</italic> gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>]. At an age of 7-10 months, these mice had increased ERG signals, shortened photoreceptor outer segments without any loss of cell bodies, reduced Elovl4 mRNA levels, and a reduced content of several C18-C24 mono-, penta- and hexa-unsaturated fatty acids. No information about homozygous knockin mice was reported for this last study.</p><p>We have also generated a genetic knockin mouse model of STGD3. However, we chose to generate gene-knockin mice that carry not only the human 5-bp STGD3 pathogenic deletion in exon 6 of the mouse <italic>Elovl4</italic> gene but also two downstream single nucleotide substitutions. This design resulted in generation of an <italic>Stgd3</italic> allele that coded for a truncated mouse Elovl4 protein which also contained an aberrant 8-amino acid C-terminus identical to that encoded by the human pathogenic <italic>STGD3</italic> allele [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>]. Our heterozygous Stgd3 mice reproduced retinal features of the human disease, lipofuscin accumulation and reduced vision, thus validating these animals as a mouse model suitable for studying the biochemical basis of STGD3 pathogenesis. One hypothetical STGD3 pathogenic mechanism is a "loss of function" mechanism resulting in deficiency of selected lipids, the putative Elovl4 products, in Elovl4-expressing tissues. Support for this mechanism is provided by the results of our analysis of epidermal lipids in neonatal homozygous Stgd3 mice which revealed a complete absence of acylceramides, a unique group of compound lipids containing C30-C40 fatty acids.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Generation of <italic>Stgd3</italic>-gene knockin mice</title><p>The targeting construct contained 4.2-kb of 5'-recombination target, a 1.6-kb loxP-flanked <italic>Neo</italic> cassette, 2.6-kb of genomic DNA containing the 2.1-kb <italic>Elovl4</italic> exon 6 sequence with the human STGD3 mutation, and 3.1-kb of 3'-recombination target (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1B</xref>).

The eyes of 9-month-old heterozygous Stgd3 mice, while not showing statistically significant changes in retinal A2E levels, did have increased levels of the A2E precursors, A2PE-H<sub>2</sub> and A2PE. Recent studies have shown that these precursors are slowly converted in vivo into A2E in wt mice after intravitreal administration of A2PE-H<sub>2</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>]. Since A2E and its precursors are major fluorescent constituents of lipofuscin, this suggests that heterozygous Stgd3 mice replicate STGD3-associated retinal lipofuscin accumulation, and that they may represent a model of the early steps of this process. Previously, increased A2E levels have also been shown in transgenic mice over-expressing a human STGD3 protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>] as well as in <italic>abca4</italic>-gene knockout mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>], an animal model of the phenotypically similar Stargardt disease-1. A2E has been shown to be cytotoxic to retinal pigmented epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r38">38</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r40">40</xref>] and, when present, may play a role in the pathogenesis of macular degenerations, including age-related macular degeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r41">41</xref>].</p><p>Heterozygous Stgd3 mice also showed defects in visual function, again replicating visual function alterations in STGD3 patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>]. The decrease in rod b-wave amplitudes recorded in our mutant mice is similar to a decrease reported for transgenic mice that over-express human STGD3 protein in photoreceptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>]. Although the heterozygous Stgd3 mice exhibit biochemical and functional changes in the retina, we do not see any significant morphological changes in the eyes of 8-month-old animals using light microscopy. Ongoing studies will determine whether morphological changes will be observed in much older animals. However, the lack of morphological change in our 8-month-old mutants agrees with the observation that heterozygous <italic>Elovl4</italic> gene-knockout mice had only minimal morphological abnormalities at the age of 17 to 19 months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>]. This lack of change, observed in both our Stgd3 mice and in the <italic>Elovl4</italic> gene-knockout mice, contrasts with the progressive, although limited, morphological changes reported in the retinas of another <italic>Elovl4</italic> 5 bp-deletion knock-in mouse model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>]. This difference between the two <italic>Elovl4</italic>-gene knockin mouse models is probably a result of several differences that exist between the two models.</p><p>Compared to the mice generated by Vassireddy et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>], our Stgd3 mice carry, besides the common 5-bp deletion, two additional point mutations to generate the STGD3 protein C-terminus. As a result the C-termini of both mutated Elovl4 proteins are different. Additionally, there are also other differences between these two mouse models. First of all, we inserted loxP in intron 5 of our Stgd3 mouse allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>), with the result that the loxP sequence is not incorporated into the mutant Elovl4 mRNA. In contrast, the Vassireddy's mouse model was generated using a targeting vector which contained a loxP-flanked Neo-cassette inserted in exon 6. After Cre-mediated deletion of the Neo-cassette, this would result in the presence of one loxP sequence in exon 6 and, therefore, in the resulting mutant Elovl4 mRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>]. The presence of this additional 34-nucleotide sequence, consisting of two 13-bp inverted repeats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r42">42</xref>], may explain the different levels of mutant Elovl4 mRNAs detected in both mouse groups. Vassireddy et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>] found a reduction by approximately a half of the levels of mutant Elovl4 mRNA compared to the wt Elovl4 mRNA in retinas of heterozygous mutant mice. In contrast, in our heterozygous Stgd3 mice the retinal levels of the mutant and wt Elovl4 mRNAs were the same (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3B</xref>). Beside the above mentioned differences in nucleotide sequences and stability of mutant Elovl4 mRNAs, both mouse models are on different genetic backgrounds.</p><p>To investigate the biochemical effects of the mutant allele in our <italic>Elovl4</italic> 5 bp-deletion knock-in mouse model, we initially examined the effects on Elovl4 mRNA levels. Using a quantitative nuclease protection assay, we showed that expression of mRNA from the mutant <italic>Stgd3</italic> allele in heterozygous Stgd3 retinas does not lead to any up-regulation of expression from the wt <italic>Elovl4</italic> allele. In fact, the mRNAs derived from both, the <italic>Stgd3</italic> and <italic>wt</italic> alleles, were present at the same levels. There is, thus, no regulatory mechanism that detects and/or compensate at the Elovl4 mRNA level for the presence of the pathogenic <italic>Stgd3</italic> allele. Therefore, the pathogenesis involves a downstream pathway, most likely causing a deficit of Elovl4 protein and/or its products.</p><p>This conclusion is supported by the findings that all three different STGD3-associated mutations identified in the <italic>ELOVL4</italic> gene lead to protein truncation, with resulting loss of an ER retention signal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>]. Previous studies have shown that the human mutated ELOVL4 protein, when expressed in transfected cultured cells, bound to co-expressed human wt ELOVL4 protein and carried it from the ER [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>], the site of fatty acid synthesis. The result of this dominant negative effect is a loss of the ER-located ELOVL4 protein. Additional possible outcomes of an abnormal ELOVL4 subcellular localization may be deficiency of ELOVL4 lipid products and/or a reduction in the wt and mutant ELOVL4 protein levels.</p><p>Further support for the dominant negative effect of the STGD3 mutation and resulting Elovl4 enzyme deficiency is suggested by the recently published studies in heterozygous <italic>Elovl4</italic> gene-knockout mice. Compared to their wt littermates, these mice had no remarkable changes in ERG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>]. This is in contrast to the reduced ERG signals in the heterozygous Stgd3 mice we report. One explanation for the ERG difference may be increased ER deficiency of Elovl4 protein in heterozygous Stgd3 mice as a result of its cellular miss-localization in the presence of the mutated Elovl4 protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>].</p><p>Since the ER is the site of synthesis of very long chain fatty acids, an end-result of loss of ELOVL4 from there would be deficiency of the ELOVL4 enzymatic products, especially given that the elongation step is assumed to be the rate-limiting step in synthesis of long chain fatty acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>]. That the fatty acid products of the <italic>Elovl4</italic> gene are important cellular constituents was suggested by the neonatal lethality observed in our homozygous Stgd3 mice and the recently reported inability to obtain homozygous <italic>Elovl4</italic>-gene knockout mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>]. The most obvious change in the new-born homozygous Stgd3 mice was loss of skin barrier function. Whether a similar defect in skin function would be present in humans homozygous for the STGD3 mutation is unknown since we are not aware of any reported progeny from parents who are both heterozygous for the STGD3 mutation.</p><p>However, a similar skin phenotype has previously been described for mice with aberrant skin lipid metabolism caused by deletion of acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>], fatty acid transport protein-4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r43">43</xref>], or ARNT-transcription factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r37">37</xref>], and for mice lacking keratinocyte transglutaminase which cross-links keratinocyte proteins producing insoluble membranous structures in the stratum corneum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref>]. Mutations in keratinocyte transglutaminase have been found in some families with the autosomal recessive skin disorder termed lamellar ichtyosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r44">44</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r46">46</xref>]. Similar human skin pathologies may also involve <italic>ELOVL4</italic>. This conclusion is supported by observation that atopic dermatitis results from defective skin barrier function caused by significantly reduced levels of acylceramides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r47">47</xref>] which are completely absent from the epidermis of our homozygous Stgd3 mice.</p><p>Epidermal keratinocytes synthesize acylceramide and non-acylceramide lipids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">33</xref>]. Because homozygous Stgd3 mouse epidermis contains non-acylceramides, all four keratinocyte layers and high levels of mutated Elovl4 mRNA, we conclude that the <italic>Elovl4-</italic>expressing cells are still present in homozygous Stgd3 mouse epidermis and that the lack of acylceramides is a direct result of the STGD3 mutation in the Elovl4 protein. The compound acylceramide lipids, therefore, emerge as, previously unknown, products of the Elovl4 biosynthetic pathway. Deficit of these lipids in homozygous Stgd3 mice is most probably caused by a lack of one of their biosynthetic components. Homozygous Stgd3 epidermis was found to have a normal complement of non-acylceramide lipids, lipids which share ceramide backbones and in some cases linoleic acid in common with acylceramides. This suggests that it is absence of another acylceramide component that leads to their complete absence in homozygous Stgd3 mouse skin. Unique to acylceramides, as compared to non-acylceramides, and present in all classes of acylceramides, are very long chain fatty acids containing 30-40 carbon atoms. Our studies suggest that these fatty acids are the direct elongation products of Elovl4. Till now, no elongase has been shown to have a role in synthesis of such fatty acids. An inability to synthesize these long chain fatty acids would explain the complete absence of acylceramides from the lipid fraction of homozygous Stgd3 epidermis.</p><p>Acylceramide lipids are not found in the eye. However, other compound lipids containing very long chain C30-C40 fatty acids have been detected in the retina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r48">48</xref>], brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r49">49</xref>] and testis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r50">50</xref>], all tissues expressing high levels of Elovl4 mRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r51">51</xref>]. In bovine retina such long chain fatty acids have been found in dipolyunsaturated phosphatidylcholines (PC) which also contain DHA at the sn-2 position [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>]. These particular PC species have been shown to maintain a tight association with rhodopsin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r52">52</xref>]. Ongoing studies will address whether these PC species are altered in STGD3 retinas.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by grants from the National Institutes of Health (EY15409 to WK, EY 05235 to DGB and EY014467 to AOE), a Julia Duane Scholarship to AOE and WK, a grant from the David M.
