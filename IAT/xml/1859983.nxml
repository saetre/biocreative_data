These include <italic>Neisseria meningitidis</italic> (Nm) and <italic>Haemophilus influenzae</italic> (Hi) that can cause disseminated or persistent localized infections. To define the precise structural features that determine the binding of distinct pathogens with CEACAMs, we have undertaken molecular modelling and mutation of the receptor molecules at previously implicated key target residues required for bacterial binding. These include Ser-32, Tyr-34, Val-39, Gln-44 and Gln-89, in addition to Ile-91, the primary docking site for the pathogens. Most, but not all, of these residues located adjacent to each other in a previous N-domain model of human CEACAM1, which was based on REI, CD2 and CD4. In the current studies, we have refined this model based on the mouse CEACAM1 crystal structure, and observe that all of the above residues form an exposed continuous binding region on the N-domain. Examination of the model also suggested that substitution of two of these residues 34 and 89 could affect the accessibility of Ile-91 for ligand binding. By introducing selected mutations at the positions 91, 34 and 89, we confirmed the primary importance of Ile-91 in all bacterial binding to CEACAM1 despite the inter- and intraspecies structural differences between the bacterial CEACAM-binding ligands. The studies further indicated that the efficiency of binding was significantly enhanced for specific strains by mutations such as Y34F and Q89N, which also altered the hierarchy of Nm versus Hi strain binding. These studies imply that distinct polymorphisms in human epithelial CEACAMs have the potential to decrease or increase the risk of infection by the receptor-targeting pathogens.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>The bacterial pathogens <italic>Neisseria meningitidis</italic> (Nm) and <italic>Haemophilus influenzae</italic> (Hi) are frequently found in the nasopharynx of a substantial proportion of the healthy population but are capable of causing serious infections in susceptible individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Turk, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Foxwell <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>). Nm and typable Hi (THi) can invade the nasopharyngeal epithelial barrier to cause septicaemia and meningitis, which in the case of Nm, may rapidly become life threatening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">van Deuren <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>). Non-typable Hi (NTHi), which lack a polysaccharide capsule, are associated with localized respiratory tract and conjunctival infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Foxwell <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>). Strains belonging to Hi-biogroup aegyptius (Hi-aeg) are also associated with Brazilian purpuric fever (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Foxwell <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>). The factors that determine susceptibility to infection by these frequent colonizers are not entirely clear.</p><p>For both colonization and pathogenesis, the first essential step is adherence to mucosal epithelial cells. Many investigations have shown bacterial targeting of specific human signalling molecules such as integrins, sialic acid binding Ig like lectins (Siglecs) and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)-related cell adhesion molecules (CEACAMs) can lead to cellular invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">Virji <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Hauck and Meyer, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Jones <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). Of these, CEACAMs have emerged as common targets of several respiratory mucosal pathogens and include Nm, Hi, <italic>Moraxella catarrhalis</italic>, as well as the urogenital pathogen <italic>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</italic> and enteric pathogens <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and <italic>Salmonella</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Leusch <italic>et al.</italic>, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">Virji <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Chen <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Gray-Owen <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Hill and Virji, 2003</xref>).</p><p>Carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecules belong to the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily. Several members of the CEACAM subgroup are expressed on human epithelial cells and include the widely expressed transmembrane CEACAM1 as well asGPI-anchored CEA and CEACAM6. All CEACAMs have an N-terminal IgV-like domain and variable numbers of IgC2-like A and B domains. CEACAM1 comprises up to four extracellular domains: N, A1, B and A2 and either a long or a short cytoplasmic tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Tsutsumi <italic>et al.</italic>, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Prall <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Hammarstrom, 1999</xref>). Various functions have been attributed to CEACAM1 including cell&#x02013;cell adhesion, insulin regulation and angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Obrink, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Hammarstrom, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">Wagener and Ergun, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Najjar, 2002</xref>). Targeting of CEACAMs by <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic>, as well as Nm and Hi leads to cellular invasion and passage across polarized monolayers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">Virji <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Gray-Owen, 2003</xref>; M. Soriani, K. Setchfield, D.J. Hill, and M. Virji, unpublished data).</p><p>A wide range of bacterial adhesins are involved in targeting the CEACAM N-terminal domains and includes Opa proteins, a major adhesin family of pathogenic <italic>Neisseria</italic> and P5 proteins of Hi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Chen and Gotschlich, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">Virji <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Hill <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>). Nm and <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> contain multiple copies of <italic>Opa</italic> genes that encode conserved domains which form &#x003b2;-barrel structures in bacterial membranes and variable domains that form surface exposed loops. In spite of the surface diversity afforded by the hyper-variable domains of the loops, the majority of the Opa proteins are capable of targeting CEACAMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">Virji <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Hauck and Meyer, 2003</xref>). The P5 proteins of Hi are similar &#x003b2;-barrel forming proteins, also with surface variable loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">Webb and Cripps, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">Vandeputte-Rutten <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). The interactions between these bacterial ligands and CEACAMs are complex and the binding domain appears to involve more than one variable loop of the bacterial adhesins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">Virji <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Bos <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">de Jonge <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). Interestingly, antibody inhibition studies have shown that the diverse ligands of neisseria and haemophilus bind to an overlapping site on the N-domain. In addition, mutational analysis of the N-domain of CEACAM1 has identified several critical residues particularly Ile-91. Alanine substitutions at these sites abrogated binding of most Opa- and P5-expressing bacteria to CEACAM1. Additional residues such as Tyr-34, Ser-32, Val-39, Gln-44 and Gln-89, most of which located in the vicinity of Ile-91, appear to determine the efficiency of interactions of various Opa and P5 molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">Virji <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">2000</xref>). The bacterial binding surface on the CEACAM1 N-domain is the protein face composed of the beta strands C&#x02032;&#x02032;, C&#x02032;, C, F and G (CFG for brevity). Despite the extensive investigations in a number of laboratories particularly on neisserial Opa proteins, it remains unclear as to precisely how CEACAM-binding ligands engage with the receptors.</p><p>A three dimensional structural model of the human CEACAM1 N-domain has been previously generated based on other Ig family molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">Virji <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>). In the current investigation, we have refined our previous model based on murine CEACAM1 crystal structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Tan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). Examination of this model showed a better confluence of the above residues into a continuous binding site and suggested that substitutions at positions 34 and 89 at the core of the binding region may affect bacterial access to the implicated key binding residue Ile-91. By introducing conservative and non-conservative substitutions at positions 34, 89 and 91, we have examined the binding of a variety of bacterial strains to the receptor constructs. The data suggest that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in individuals or populations that may introduce substitutions in CEACAM sequence particularly at the bacterial binding site, could not only decrease but also significantly increase the functional affinity of pathogen interactions. Increased binding affinity may result in increased cellular invasion and thus may lead to increased host susceptibility to infection by CEACAM-targeting bacteria.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Molecular modelling and mutations of the CEACAM1 N-domain</title><p>A three-dimensional model of CEACAM1 N-domain was previously produced based on the Ig family molecules REI, CD2 and CD4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">Virji <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>). In this model, whilst most mutations affecting binding of Nm and Hi were located centrally on the CFG face of the protein, Val-39 involved in Opa binding, was located at a distance towards the bottom of the CFG face (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1A</xref>). Subsequently, a crystal structure of murine soluble CEACAM1a domains 1 and 4 was reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Tan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). Based on this, we have remodelled the human CEACAM1 N-domain. The CC&#x02032; loop that contains Val-39 folds back against the CFG face of this model such that it lies in close proximity to the other critical residues involved in bacterial adhesion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1B</xref>). Further examination of this model suggested that the bacterial binding pocket forms a rather flat surface in the centre of the CFG face. It also appears that substituting neighbouring residues Tyr-34 and Gln-89 by Phe and Asn, respectively, could result in a further flattening of the bacterial binding surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1C&#x02013;E</xref>), providing increased access to the key Ile-91. These residue changes also increase the size of the hydrophobic patch centred on I91 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1C&#x02013;E</xref>). Both of these effects might facilitate binding of some bacterial ligands to the target receptor.</p><fig id="fig01" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Molecular models of the N-domain of human CEACAM1.

Introduction of a Leu or Thr residue at position 91 was generally less disruptive to Opa interactions. I91T substitution either did not affect binding (OpaB and OpaX) or reduced binding by 50&#x02013;60% (OpaD and OpaA). I91L substitution had no effect on OpaD or OpaB whilst having opposite effects on OpaA (&#x0223c;50% reduction) and OpaX (twofold increase) binding.</p><p>Substitutions at position 34 other than Ala also supported binding of some but not all Opa proteins. Y34S substitution was unsuitable for the three Opa proteins of strain C751 but was tolerated by OpaX of MC58. Interestingly, Phe proved to be a more favoured residue in at least two cases with OpaX as well as OpaB binding to Y34F construct at threefold higher levels than the native receptor. Substitutions of Asn at Gln-89 revealed distinct patterns of interactions and binding reduced in the order OpaA &#x0003e; OpaX &#x0003e; OpaB/D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3</xref>).</p><p>Overall, the data suggest that Opa binding to the receptor requires an extended aliphatic chain at position 91 and certain arrangements of the chain may facilitate binding of most Opa proteins (Ile = leu &#x0003e; Thr). At position 34, the removal of the hydroxyl residue (Y43F) is tolerated or preferred whereas the absence of aromatic ring (Y34S) has an overall deleterious effect on Opa binding.

The interactions of bacteria with the cell-expressed receptors were investigated in the absence (A, D) or presence of competing soluble receptors. Although binding to the soluble receptor Q89N is much lower than the native CC1 in dot-blots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3B</xref>), it is relatively high on certain cells (presumably, on those expressing high levels of the receptor) (D). In competitive experiments, the native CC1-Fc (B, E) and the CC1(Q89N)-Fc (C, F) were preincubated at 10 ug ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> with bacteria for 15 min, prior to infection of target cells. CC1-Fc inhibited bacterial binding to the homologous receptor significantly (B), and almost abrogated binding to cell-expressed Q89N (E); whereas the soluble Q89N was inefficient at inhibiting bacterial binding to CHO-CC1 (C). However, a level of homologous inhibition was apparent when examining the adhesion of bacteria to cells expressing low levels of the receptor (e.g. &#x02018;peppered&#x02019; areas shown in D are less evident in F).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="cmi0009-0329-f9"/></fig></sec><sec><title><italic>Haemophilus influenzae</italic> binding to CEACAM1 constructs</title><p>One non-typable (A950002) and two THi strains (Rd and Eagan) were used in receptor overlay experiments as above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4</xref>). Alanine substitutions at Ile-91 confirmed previous results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">Virji <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>). Taken individually, substitutions of Ile-91 for Ala or Thr abrogated binding of all three strains. However, substitution I91L reduced binding only of the THi strain Eagan, suggesting a requirement for the extended hydrophobic arm of Ile in Eagan binding. Alanine substitution of Tyr-34 abrogated the binding of Rd and Eagan, whereas no effect on NTHi A950002 was observed. In contrast, Y34F substitution led to an increased binding of all three strains varying from 45 to 80% above native receptor binding levels, whereas Y34S had a differential effect on the three strains tested, ranging from no binding of Rd to a slight increase in the binding of A950002. These data broadly reflect results with neisserial Opa binding. Finally substitutions at Gln-89 show that reduction or abrogation of the side chain (Q89N and Q89A) has no deleterious effect, rather its effect is often that of enhanced binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4</xref>).</p><fig id="fig04" position="float"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Relative binding of CEACAM1-Fc constructs to typable and non-typable <italic>H. influenzae</italic> strains.

In addition, as with some Nm strains, the requirement for hydrophobic and aliphatic chains was partly fulfilled by Leu and to a lesser extent by Thr. Substitutions of residue Tyr-34 with Phe or Ser produced a complex profile. Phe generally created a suitable or better environment but the loss of the aromatic ring was also tolerated (Y34S).

Consistent with the lower affinity of Ha3 compared with C751<sub>OpaB/D</sub> for CEACAM1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">Virji <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>), the proportion of the native CEACAM1 that interacted with Ha3 compared with C751<sub>OpaB</sub> was lower and declined further at limiting concentrations of the receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6A</xref>). In contrast, Ha3 and C751<sub>OpaB</sub> had similar affinities for the receptor when the Q89N construct was present in excess (&#x0003e; 0.13 &#x003bc;g ml<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6B</xref>). Further, at limiting concentrations of Q89N, the greater affinity of Ha3 was apparent and bound this construct threefold more than the Nm derivative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig06">Fig. 6B</xref>). The data demonstrate the potential influence of structural modulations at the bacterial binding site in changing the colonization profile of the target tissue.</p><fig id="fig06" position="float"><label>Fig. 6</label><caption><p>Relative binding and competition for variant CEACAM1 constructs by <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> and <italic>H. influenzae</italic>.

Initially, binding of the anti-CEACAM antibodies to transfected CHO cells was examined and their binding was as observed for the soluble receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig07">Fig. 7</xref>). However, bacterially expressed ligands may overcome decreased affinity for specific mutant proteins due to multiple ligand-receptor engagement at the target cell surface. Examination of adherent bacteria and levels of receptor expression by microscopy revealed that bacteria bound to all transfectants other than sham-transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig08">Fig. 8</xref>). However, receptor expression levels had to be considerably high in the case of I91A for significant bacterial numbers to bind the transfectants.

The data emphasize the importance of cell presentation of receptor in addition to receptor structure in bacterial interactions. The final outcome of this depends on the balance between the effects exerted by residue substitutions and receptor density. Both can affect functional affinity of bacteria&#x02013;host interactions.</p></sec><sec><title>Overall analysis of modified receptor targeting</title><p>To assess the relative importance and the degree of influence of each substitution on bacterial interactions, degrees of receptor recognition were assigned several categories as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10A</xref>. The data show that substitution I91A has a profound effect on the interactions of all strains and whilst the side chain of Ile-91 is best suited to all, Leu can effectively substitute for Ile for several strains, whilst the polar Thr is less well tolerated. However, some Nm Opa proteins can also tolerate I91T substitution. Tyr-34 is also required in most cases. Interestingly, Phe-34 is preferred in general at this position over the native Tyr. Substitutions at Gln-89 have a deleterious effect on binding of some Nm Opa derivatives and the smaller Q89N apparently is better suited overall for binding by Hi and especially Hi-aeg strains. The data emphasize the extensive inter- and intraspecies ligand variations in this receptor targeting, perhaps with greater interstrain differences in Nm.</p><fig id="fig10" position="float"><label>Fig. 10</label><caption><p>Binding of bacterial ligands to CEACAM1-Fc constructs as determined in the current study.

The hypervariable loops HV1 and HV2 of Opa proteins have been implicated in the binding of CEACAMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">Virji <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Bos <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">de Jonge <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). Given that the combinations of HV regions of OpaA, B and D of strain C751 provide three distinct combinations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Fig. 10C</xref>), this is consistent with the distinct patterns of targeting of the variant receptor molecules observed in the study. However, the proteins must all contain sufficient similarity to bind the hydrophobic region around I91.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The N-terminal domains of the cell-expressed CEA family of molecules are highly homologous and the majority of CEACAMs are targeted by one or more pathogenic neisserial adhesins belonging to the Opa family of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">Virji <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Chen <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Gray-Owen <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>). Despite the structural variability, all Opa proteins target a common site on the receptors whose centre of binding appears to be Ile-91 on the CFG face of the N-domains. Ile-91 is conserved throughout the CEA members. Most of the other important residues on CEACAM1 identified by alanine scanning mutagenesis located in a close proximity of Ile-91 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">Virji <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>). Precisely how variant Opa proteins can bind to a common receptor site is not entirely clear but a complementary set of sequences of more than one variable domains of Opa proteins may be involved. This variability of the ligands may determine the binding preference for distinct members of the CEA family which represents one mechanism that may determine tissue tropism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">Virji <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Bos <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Gray-Owen, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Hauck and Meyer, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">de Jonge <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>).</p><p>Diverse strains of typable and NTHi lineages including the biogroup aegyptius also bind to the CFG face of the N-domain of CEACAM1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">Virji <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>). In our previous analysis of receptor binding, THi isolates were shown to behave similarly: each strain tested having a primary requirement for Ile-91 and in addition, was affected by Y34A and Q44A substitutions. In the current study also, the THi strain Rd and Eagan demonstrate similar overall binding patterns. However, in all cases, intraspecies differences in response to different amino acid substitutions were apparent. One consistency between all species and strains tested was the dramatic loss of binding following I91A substitution which, as observed previously, appears to be central in an overlapping bacterial binding footprint on CEACAM1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">Virji <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">2000</xref>). A similar situation occurs on the mouse CEACAM1a (MHVR1a) N-terminal domain, in which Ile-41 appears to engage with the mouse hepatitis virus spike protein. Replacement of Ile-41 by Thr in the MHVR1b allele reduces virus binding significantly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Tan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). Cell surface receptor interactions with their ligands often involve hydrophobic contact points which provides the major binding energy. Hydrophobic residues surrounding these contribute to the specificity of binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Clackson and Wells, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Kwong <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Kim <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>). Thus in murine CEACAM1, the protruding Ile-41, which is surrounded by a number of surface exposed charged residues, e.g. Asp-42, Glu-44, Arg-47, Asp89, Glu-93 and Arg-97, might form such a binding area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Tan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). Accordingly from current studies also, mutations introduced at position 91 in the human receptor support the requirement for a hydrophobic pocket at this site. In addition, an extended aliphatic chain is preferred as Ala disrupted binding of all bacteria and the polar Thr reduced binding of all Hi and several Nm strains. Only I91L was more frequently tolerated. This binding pocket is flanked by several polar residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1</xref>) whose contribution to bacterial ligand binding is apparent and variable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">Virji <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">2000</xref>).</p><p>The importance of the Ile-91 and the surrounding residues on human CEACAM1 in bacterial binding is also supported by the observation that the mAb YTH71.3 directed against the N-domain also requires several residues in common with bacteria and blocks binding of all CEACAM1-binding bacteria we have investigated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">Virji <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Hill and Virji, 2003</xref>).</p><p>The murine N-domain strand arrangement derived form crystal structure depicts the CC&#x02032; loop to assume a convoluted conformation. The previous model of human CEACAM1 contained a flat CC&#x02032; loop like the Ig-folds on which it was based. This resulted in Val-39 and Gly-41 being located at a distance from the binding focus Ile-91. Both Val-39 and Gly-41 have been implicated in bacterial binding from alanine scanning and homologue scanning mutagenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Bos <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">Virji <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>).</p><p>The remodelling shown here of CEACAM1 produces the convoluted structure of the CC&#x02032; loop relocating Val-39 close to Ile-91. Further, the aromatic ring of Tyr-34 suggested to be required to maintain the convoluted structure of the CC&#x02032; loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Tan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>) when substituted with Phe almost always supported bacterial binding. Indeed, Y34F provides a better environment for most bacterial strains tested. On the other hand, Y34A frequently abrogated receptor recognition. However and surprisingly, Y34S is tolerated by a substantial number of bacterial ligands. Whether this is due to the flexible variable loop domains of the bacterial ligands which may produce an induced fit around the receptor needs consideration. Interestingly, Tyr-34 is conserved in the majority of the human CEACAMs with the exception of CEACAM4 which contains His at this site. However, the importance of Tyr-34 in human CEACAM1 maintaining the three dimensional structure requires human receptor crystallographic data.</p><p>Substitutions Y34F and Q89N also produced interesting data from the point of view of pathogenesis. Whilst Q89A and Q89N appear to affect some Opa proteins by reducing receptor recognition, suggesting its potential contribution in determining tissue tropism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">Virji <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>), Q89N substitution occasionally caused dramatic increase in bacterial adhesion, especially of Hi isolates. Y34F, as observed above, increased binding of strains within all species examined. As it is possible that multiple receptors presented on the target cells may overcome the reduced binding affinity of mutated receptors, we examined strain Rd binding to I91A and Q89A/N-substituted receptors expressed in transiently transfected COS cells. Whilst the latter receptors were targeted on cells with low levels of receptor expression, only a proportion (<italic>c</italic>. 50%) of cells with very high levels of I91A receptors had significant numbers of bacteria attached. Thus point mutations of CEACAMs can both decrease and increase bacterial load and additional factors that dictate bacterial binding include receptor levels on the target cells.</p><p>The ligands of Neisseria (i.e. Opa proteins) and of Hi so far identified (i.e. P5 proteins) share similar beta-barrel structure with surface-exposed variable loops. The regions of P5 that may engage with the receptor have not been identified but those of Opa proteins were studied by mutagenesis of strain H44/76 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">de Jonge <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). This strain is related to strain MC58, one of the strains used in the current study. The studies of de Jonge <italic>et al.</italic> implicated <italic>G</italic> &#x000d7; (I/V/l) &#x000d7; (S/E/Q) as the key motifs of HV2 regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig09">Fig. 9</xref>) of meningococcal Opa proteins in receptor targeting. Together with this, an <sup>99</sup>ELK motif of the Opa HV1 region might be involved in the three dimensional presentation of the receptor-engaging residues of the bacterial ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">de Jonge <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). Within the strain C751, OpaB and OpaD proteins contain the motif GxLxS at positions 172&#x02013;176 and 167&#x02013;171, respectively, whereas Opa A contains a <sup>168</sup>PxIxN motif. In the HV1 region, OpaA and B contain <sup>99</sup>DLK whereas OpaD contains EDK. Studies in our laboratories are in progress to assess the precise variant C751 Opa and receptor residue pairs involved in mutual recognition.</p><p>Polymorphisms that affect host susceptibility may be found at various sites in the genes encoding host receptors targeted by pathogens and may result in loss or gain of receptor-associated functions. Some SNPs may lead to multiple and diverse downstream effects, e.g. altered transcriptional response and manifestation of disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Sakuntabhai <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). Extracellular domain polymorphisms may have a more direct effect via altered binding of pathogen ligands to their receptors. SNPs of the innate immune system especially those affecting pathogen associated pattern recognition receptors and cytokines have been studied extensively. Changes such as Asp299Gly and Thr399Ile in the extracellular domains of LPS-binding Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) have been implicated in increased risk to bacterial infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Schroder and Schumann, 2005</xref>). These SNPs have also been associated with severe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) bronchiolitis in infants. In this case, altered interaction of the viral fusion (F) protein, implicated as a ligand for TLR4, is regarded as the primary mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Tal <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Schroder and Schumann, 2005</xref>). However, these TLR4 SNPs could not be correlated with meningococcal disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Read <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>). In contrast, rare SNPs were found more commonly in the TLR4 genes of patients with meningococcal disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Smirnova <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). This supports the notion that rare rather than common variants of TLR4 may be associated with infectious disease susceptibility.</p><p>Studies presented here suggest some possible polymorphisms that can increase bacterial load. Several SNPs in CEACAMs have been identified and are listed in the NCBI SNP database and three have been identified in the N-domain of CEACAM1 including one at Gln-89. In this case, a Gln-89 to His substitution is observed. Such a residue difference occurs within the members of CEACAM family. For example, CEA contains H at position 89 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2</xref>). This is the only major difference between CC1 and CEA that could affect bacterial binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Fig. 2</xref>). As such, the mutation Q89H in CC1 would be expected to produce CEA-like binding pattern and could affect tropism of the bacteria as observed for CEA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">Virji <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">de Jonge <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). Further studies are required to assess whether other CEACAM polymorphisms, for example, substitutions such as Y34F and Q89N occur in human populations and their frequencies in susceptible populations. SNP substitutions may also change the colonization profile of the nasopharynx, because in our competition studies we could demonstrate that increased binding afforded by Q89N to Hi-aeg isolate Ha3 increases the binding of Ha3 such that it out-competes Nm isolate C751<sub>OpaB</sub> in an <italic>in vitro</italic> competition assay for this receptor. The situation with the native receptor was the reverse. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig08">Figs 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig09">9</xref>, additional factors that affect bacterial binding to cell-expressed receptor include receptor density. Whilst certain residue substitutions, e.g. I91A, reduce functional affinity of bacterial interactions, high receptor densities increase such affinity. The final outcome must depend on the interplay between these two parameters. In recent studies, the role of receptor density on enhancement of bacterial attachment and invasion have been evaluated in detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Bradley <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Rowe <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). It would be interesting to analyse bacterial invasion in cell lines expressing variant CEACAM1 carrying the above mutations by employing cell lines in which the receptor expression levels can be controlled, which are under development.</p><p>Besides receptor polymorphisms, several other scenarios may lead to increased bacterial ligand binding to CEACAMs. Both Nm and Hi CEACAM-binding ligands (Opa and P5) are known to undergo antigenic variation. Thus, in any population, antigenic/structural variants are present and may be selected for during the course of host colonization and subsequent pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">Virji <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Duim <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Meyers <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). The receptor repertoire and subtypes may select bacteria capable of binding with high affinity. As mentioned above, upregulation of receptor expression on target cells may also increase bacterial binding affinity. In such cases, high affinity interactions result in cellular invasion, whereas lower affinity or load of bacteria may not proceed beyond surface adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Tran Van Nhieu and Isberg, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Bradley <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). The expression of CEACAMs on normal epithelia of the respiratory tract has been reported, which would allow bacterial attachment and possible subsequent penetration into these tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Tsutsumi <italic>et al.</italic>, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">Virji, 2001</xref>). Following exposure to cytokines such as IFN-&#x003b3; or TNF-&#x003b1;, CEACAM expression by colonic carcinoma cells has been shown to increase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Fahlgren <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). In addition, certain viral infections have also been shown to upregulate CEACAM1 expression in several epithelial cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Avadhanula <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Increased cytokine levels following viral infection could lead to increased CEACAM expression and bacterial association with respiratory epithelia and subsequent invasion of deeper tissue by these organisms. Such a situation may explain the epidemiological association of increased incidence of Nm and Hi infections following certain viral infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Cartwright <italic>et al.</italic>, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Takala <italic>et al.</italic>, 1993</xref>).</p><p>In summary, little is known about why certain people are more susceptible to infection by some of the frequent colonizers of the human nasopharynx. Interestingly, opportunistic pathogens such as Nm and Hi as well as <italic>M. catarrhalis</italic> (not investigated here) target CEACAM1<italic>.</italic> As specific substitutions such as Y &#x0003e; F and Q &#x0003e; N produce more favourable targets for distinct mucosal isolates, it is possible that occurrence of such receptor polymorphisms in the human population could lead to greater bacterial binding thus increasing the chances of cellular invasion. Given the colonization rate of these organisms (generally &#x0003e; 10% of the population) and the frequency of invasive infection (up to 3:100 000 population), a combination of events may be required to increase host susceptibility. Inflammatory conditions that increase receptor density in populations carrying specific polymorphisms could provide the worst scenario.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Experimental procedures</title><sec><title>Molecular modelling of the CEACAM1 N-domain</title><p>The sequence of mature human CEACAM1 N-domain was aligned with the corresponding domain of murine CEACAM1, giving a gapless alignment for residues 1&#x02013;109 with a residue identity of 42%.
