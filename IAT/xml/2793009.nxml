SIRT1 deacetylates a number of protein substrates, including histones, FOXOs, PGC-1&#x003b1;, and p53, leading to cellular protection. We identified a functional interaction between cJUN N-terminal kinase (JNK1) and SIRT1 by coimmunoprecipitation of endogenous proteins. The interaction between JNK1 and SIRT1 was identified under conditions of oxidative stress and required activation of JNK1 <italic>via</italic> phosphorylation. Modulation of SIRT1 activity or protein levels using nicotinamide or RNAi did not modify JNK1 activity as measured by its ability to phosphorylate cJUN. In contrast, human SIRT1 was phosphorylated by JNK1 on three sites: Ser27, Ser47, and Thr530 and this phosphorylation of SIRT1 increased its nuclear localization and enzymatic activity. Surprisingly, JNK1 phosphorylation of SIRT1 showed substrate specificity resulting in deacetylation of histone H3, but not p53. These findings identify a mechanism for regulation of SIRT1 enzymatic activity in response to oxidative stress and shed new light on its role in the stress protection pathway.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Sirtuins are NAD<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>-dependent deacetylases (or ADP-ribosyltransferases) that remove acetyl groups from (or add ADP-ribose to) protein substrates, thereby regulating the biological function of their targets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008414-Blander1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

Given our interest in understanding SIRT1 regulation in the context of oxidative stress, we tested for a functional relationship between SIRT1 and JNK1 in a cellular system. To examine a potential interaction between SIRT1 and JNK1, co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed from HEK293T cells. Both JNK1 and phosphorylated JNK1 (pJNK1) were immunoprecipitated and associated proteins were identified by Western blotting. An interaction between SIRT1 and JNK1 was observed only when cells were treated with the known JNK1 activators anisomycin or H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008414-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). Anisomycin and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>treatment led to phosphorylation of JNK1, as expected. When either JNK1 or pJNK1 were immunoprecipitated following treatment of HEK293T cells with or without anisomycin, SIRT1 only co-immunoprecipitated with the antibody against pJNK1, further indicating SIRT1 interacts with phosphorylated- but not unphosphorylated JNK1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008414-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>).

This is the first report identifying JNK1 as a kinase that functionally modifies SIRT1, increasing SIRT1 activity and altering SIRT1 localization. Specifically, phosphorylation of SIRT1 increases deacetylation of histone H3. By modifying chromatin SIRT1 induction might modulate a set of genes that will confer protection from oxidative stress. In support of this hypothesis, Berthiaume and colleagues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008414-Berthiaume1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref> have shown that high levels of cellular oxidative stress globally inhibit gene transcription and this correlates with a significant decrease in histone H3 and H4 acetylation. This could be a protective mechanism to promote cell survival. Cells may induce histone deacetylation to increase DNA integrity and reduce DNA damage mediated by free radicals. Further studies to identify changes in specific genes related to deacetylation of histone H3 are ongoing. The findings presented here have implications in understanding how SIRT1 might mediate the survival of cells under oxidative stress conditions.</p><p>Recently, it has been shown that JNK2 can phopshorylate SIRT1 at Ser27 under basal conditions, increasing SIRT1 protein stability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008414-Ford1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. We can not rule the possibility that JNK2 may play a role in H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> mediated phosphorylation of SIRT1. In addition, cyclin dependent kinases (Cyclin B/Cdk1) phosphorylate SIRT1, increasing deacetylase activity and regulating cell cycle progression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008414-Sasaki1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. These studies suggest hierarchical levels of phosphorylation as a second-site on SIRT1 must be phosphorylated to detect Cyclin B/Cdk1 regulation. These findings, coupled with the work presented here shed new light on how SIRT1 can be modified in cells by postranslational modifications and in particular how SIRT1 can differentially respond to physiological events, like oxidative stress.</p><p>SIRT1 is a cell survival factor that may increase resistance to oxidative stress in mammalian cells. In normal human fibroblast IMR-90 cells, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced apoptosis was attenuated by SIRT1 overexpression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008414-Luo1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. In HEK293T cells treated with serum collected from calorie-restricted rats, SIRT1 expression level was increased and Bax-mediated apoptosis was inhibited <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008414-Cohen1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. More recently, it was shown that SIRT1 plays an essential role in mediating cell survival in cardiac myocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008414-Alcendor1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008414-Tanno1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. Kume et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008414-Kume1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref> have shown that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induction of p53 acetylation was decreased in mesangial cells overexpressing SIRT1, similar to data we obtained in a different cell line (HEK293T). In addition, neither overexpression nor knockdown of SIRT1 affected H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-mediated phosphorylation of MAP kinases (p38, JNK or MAPK). This is in agreement with our finding that SIRT1 has no effect on JNK1 activity. Tanno et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008414-Tanno1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref> indicate that SIRT1 nucleocytoplasmic shuttling, in response to oxidative stress, is a regulatory mechanism which may increase cellular resistance to apoptosis. In keeping with this notion, our data suggest that phosphorylation via JNK1 is an important regulator of SIRT1 subcellular localization and function. Taken together, these studies support the notion that phosphorylation of SIRT1 by JNK1 is a protective mechanism against oxidative stress.</p><p>The cellular balance between SIRT1 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) activity may determine the effects of oxidative stress on cell survival. In contrast to the present study, activation of JNK1 (via oxidative stress) has previously been shown to mediate cell death via PARP-1 activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008414-Zhang1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. PARP-1 is a member of a nuclear enzyme family that functions as post-translational regulators of DNA damage repair. Despite its beneficial effect in DNA repair, PARP-1 activation has been implicated in necrotic cell death. This apparent contrast in the regulation of the stress response by JNK1 may be a function of the level of cellular damage. In the present study cells were treated with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for 1 h, resulting in minimal cell death, whereas the JNK1:PARP-1 association required longer (&#x0223c;6 h) cellular H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> exposure. Perhaps during prolonged H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> exposure, DNA damage accumulates and massive PARP-1 activation quickly depletes cellular NAD<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> (a SIRT1 co-substrate), leading to decreased SIRT1 activity and necrotic cell death. Conversely, acute (or low-level) exposure to oxidative stress activates SIRT1, promoting the chance for cellular recovery.</p><p>During the last two decades progress in the genetics of aging in invertebrate models such as <italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> has clearly demonstrated the existence of regulatory pathways that control the rate of aging in these organisms, such as the insulin-like pathway, the JNK pathway and the Sir2 deacetylase pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008414-Guarente1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. It has been shown both in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and in <italic>C.elegans</italic> that activation of the stress responsive JNK pathway has major implications for modulating lifespan. In both organisms it seems that the effect of overexpression of JNK on increased lifespan was mediated by nuclear localization of dFoxo/Daf16 and induction of its target genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008414-Wang1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008414-Oh1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. Here we show that in mammalian systems an additional pathway might be responsible to protect cells under oxidative stress conditions. It is not surprising that both overexpression of SIRT1 and/or activation of the JNK pathway lead to accumulation of less oxidative damage and increase lifespan. The survival-enhancing characteristics of sirtuins suggest that they influence mammalian responses to toxicity and could be new therapeutic targets for improvement of tissue survival in toxicity-related diseases, particularly neurodegenerative disorders.</p><p>In conclusion, oxidative stress activates JNK1, which directly phosphorylates SIRT1 at Ser27, Ser47, and Thr530, concentrating it into the nucleus. In the nucleus, phosphorylated SIRT1 selectively deacetylates histone H3, but not p53. These findings establish a molecular mechanism linking oxidative stress to SIRT1.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cell Culture</title><p>Human embryonic kidney (293T) and mouse myoblast (C2C12) cells from ATCC were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM).

Truncated SIRT1 (amino acids 170&#x02013;701) was obtained by subcloning poly-histidine, S-tagged SIRT1 into a pNAT40 vector containing a PreScission protease cleavage site after the S-tag.

After dehydrating the bands, the proteins therein were reduced using 10 mM DTT for 45 minutes at 58&#x000b0;C. Next the proteins were alkylated on the cysteines using iodoacetamide at room temperature, in the dark.

Solution based samples, such as those from the <italic>in vitro</italic> studies, were prepared in similar fashion, but with no need to extract peptides from the gel matrix. The samples were digested overnight at 37&#x000b0;C for trypsin and room temperature for chymotrypsin and GluC. Peptides from the in-gel digests were extracted using 50&#x00025; acetonitrile, 45&#x00025; water and 5&#x00025; formic acid with vortexing. After proteolysis peptides were dried down and rehydrated in a small volume for loading to the liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC/MS) instrument.

Mass spectrometry of eluting peptides was achieved using either a Q-Tof Global (Micromass Q-Tof Global Ultima, Waters) or LTQ FT (Thermo) set to acquire in data dependent mode. Processed data was analyzed using Mascot (Matrix Sciences) to identify the proteins from the gel bands and sites of phosphorylation on detected peptides.
