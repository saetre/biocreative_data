Whereas WASp is dispensable for early bone marrow B-cell development, WASp deficiency results in a marked reduction in each of the major mature peripheral B-cell subsets, exerting the greatest impact on marginal zone and B1a B cells. Using in vivo bromodeoxyuridine labeling and in vitro functional assays, we show that these deficits reflect altered peripheral homeostasis, partially resulting from an impairment in integrin function, rather than a developmental defect. Consistent with these observations, we also show that: (1) WASp expression levels increase with cell maturity, peaking in those subsets exhibiting the greatest sensitivity to WASp deficiency; (2) WASp<sup>+</sup> murine B cells exhibit a marked selective advantage beginning at the late transitional B-cell stage; and (3) a similar in vivo selective advantage is manifest by mature WASp<sup>+</sup> human B cells. Together, our data provide a better understanding of the clinical phenotype of WAS and suggest that gene therapy might be a useful approach to rescue altered B-cell homeostasis in this disease.</p></abstract><contract-num rid="CS100">HD37091</contract-num><contract-num rid="CS100">AI071163</contract-num><contract-sponsor id="CS100" xlink:href="http://www.nih.gov">National Institutes of Health</contract-sponsor><contract-sponsor id="CS200" xlink:href="http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/">Wellcome Trust</contract-sponsor></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) is an X-linked immunodeficiency disorder characterized by recurrent infections, microthrombocytopenia, and eczema. In addition, WAS is associated with an increased incidence of autoimmune disease and hematologic malignancies, especially B-cell lymphomas.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref></sup> Affected patients are susceptible to bacterial, viral, and fungal infections, secondary to defects in both cellular and humoral immunity. Lymphopenia is a common finding in WAS patients from infancy on, mainly because of reduced numbers of T cells, whereas B cells are normal or moderately decreased.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref></sup> Antibody responses are adequate to some antigens and insufficient to others. In particular, WAS patients fail to respond to polysaccharide antigens and are highly susceptible to infections with <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref></sup></p><p>The affected gene, <italic>WASP</italic>, encodes a multidomain protein, WASp, which is exclusively expressed in hematopoietic cells and is the founding member of a family of proteins involved in the transduction of signals to the actin cytoskeleton.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref></sup> The actin cytoskeleton plays a crucial role in cell adhesion and migration, antigen receptor surface assembly and turnover, and formation of the T-cell immunologic synapse on cell stimulation. Each of these pathways can be affected in WAS and contribute to the clinical phenotype. Several studies have demonstrated defective macrophage and DC migration and adhesion,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref></sup> and more recent studies also suggest impaired trafficking of T and B cells as well as neutrophils.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref></sup> Both human and murine WASp<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> T cells exhibit defective actin polymerization, impaired T-cell receptor capping,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref></sup> reduced ability to produce interleukin-2, and decreased proliferation in response to anti-CD3 stimulation in vitro.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref></sup></p><p>Studies investigating B-cell function in both human and murine WAS have been more limited in scope and have led to various results and interpretations. Study of Epstein-Barr virus&#x02013;transformed B-cell lines derived from WAS patients showed defective actin polymerization.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref></sup> Ca<sup>++</sup>-flux upon B-cell receptor (BCR) stimulation of human B cells has been reported to be normal<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref></sup> or reduced.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref></sup> In WASp<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, the proliferative response to BCR engagement was either slightly reduced<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref></sup> or normal.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref></sup> The latter study also showed normal capping of B cells in response to BCR stimulation. Westerberg et al demonstrated impaired polarization, spreading, homotypic aggregation, and microvilli formation in response to CD40 stimulation, and defective migration to CXCL13 in WASp<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> primary murine B cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref></sup> In addition, both WAS patients and WASp<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice exhibit a marked reduction in the number of splenic marginal zone (MZ) B cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref></sup> These findings are consistent with the lack of antibody responses to pneumococcal polysaccharides in humans<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref></sup> and decreased antibody response to TI immunization with dextran in mice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref></sup></p><p>In an effort to better understand the relative contributions of the B-cell lineage to the immunodeficiency of WAS, we performed a detailed analysis of each of the major B-cell developmental subsets in WASp<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> animals. We also used 3 independent in vivo models to precisely characterize the requirement for WASp in the central versus peripheral B-cell compartments. Our results demonstrate specific, B cell&#x02013;intrinsic defects in cell numbers within each of the mature B-cell developmental subsets. Further, using a combination of in vitro functional assays and in vivo labeling studies, our data demonstrate that these changes reflect altered B lymphoid homeostasis rather than a developmental defect. Finally, we show that WASp-expressing B cells exhibit a strong selective advantage over WASp-deficient B cells in both humans and mice.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Animal studies</title><p>Six- to 8-week-old C57BL/6, &#x003bc;MT and WASp<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> (F10 on a C57BL/6 background) mice were maintained in the SPF animal facility at Children's Hospital (Seattle, WA) and handled according to Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee-approved protocols.

B1a and B1b populations exhibited significantly more BrdU<sup>+</sup> cells on day 3 and a trend for greater labeling at day 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B). Comparing the BrdU labeling kinetics, it was evident that the turnover rate of WASp<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> B cells was significantly higher beyond the T1 B-cell stage.

BAFF-R engagement promotes processing of NF-&#x003ba;B2 p100 and enhances the expression of survival genes.

The formation of the mature IS after BCR stimulation requires the inside-out activation of integrins and is characterized by the segregation of leukocyte function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) into a stable peripheral supramolecular adhesion complex (pSMAC). Therefore, we compared the formation of the mature IS in WT and WASp<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> B cells after settling on planar lipid bilayers containing anti-BCR with or without ICAM-1. We observed that WT and WASp<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> B cells were able to aggregate activating antibody into a cSMAC to a similar extent, both in the presence and absence of ICAM-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A,B). However, in the presence of ICAM-1, WT B cells exhibited an increased contact area, shown by IRM, as a result of forming a stable pSMAC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A,D). In contrast, WASp<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> B cells were unable to increase their contact area in the presence of ICAM-1 and were significantly impaired in the formation of the mature IS as a result of their inability to aggregate LFA-1 into a stable pSMAC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A,C-E). These findings indicate that WASp<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> B cells exhibit defective BCR-mediated inside-out integrin signaling.

These cell populations function in concert in an interactive network to mediate both innate and adaptive immune responses. Thus, to understand the contribution of a specific cell lineage to the clinical phenotype in WAS, it is crucial to use models capable of identifying cell intrinsic functional responses.</p><p>In the current study, we analyzed the phenotype of key B lymphoid compartments within WASp<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. Our data demonstrate that central BM B-cell development is normal in WASp<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. In contrast, the mature, peripheral B-cell compartment exhibits marked alterations with a reduction in the absolute numbers of splenic MZP/MZ B cells, peritoneal B1a B cells, and BM-derived recirculating mature B cells. Using chimeric BM transplantation experiments, we show that each of these changes is secondary to a B cell&#x02013;intrinsic defect(s). Further, we show a strong correlation between the observed B-cell defects and relative level of WASp expression in populations most severely affected in WASp<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. Consistent with each of these findings, we observe a selective advantage for WASp<sup>+</sup> B cells beyond the early transitional (T1) B-cell stage. Our analysis further suggests that this phenotype is caused by a homeostatic defect. Finally, analysis of peripheral blood from normal persons and a WAS patient with a revertant mutation indicates that key observations derived from the murine knockout model mirror the role for WASp in human B-cell function.</p><p>Our data complement and extend previously published results<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref></sup> suggesting that WASp expression was largely dispensable for early B-cell development. We observe no difference in the number or phenotype of BM B-cell developmental subsets or early transitional (T1) B cells in the spleen in WASp<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> versus WT mice; or in chimeric &#x003bc;MT recipient mice transplanted with WT versus WASp<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> BM cells. In addition and consistent with this, there was no selective advantage of WASp<sup>+</sup> B cells at these developmental stages in WASp heterozygous mice. In contrast to our findings, a previous study suggested that WASp<sup>+</sup> BM cells exhibit a selective advantage in transplantation models because of defective chemotaxis in WASp<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref></sup> Whereas this difference may reflect alternative methods for transplant conditioning, our analysis of WASp heterozygous mice has failed to identify any significant selective advantage for lineage-negative, hematopoietic stem cells or BM derived myeloid cells<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref></sup> (A. Astrakhan and D.J.R., unpublished results, 2008).</p><p>We show that WASp expression increases after the early transitional B-cell stage to reach its highest expression level in MZP, MZ, and B1a B cells. This increase in WASp expression is associated with a progressive selective advantage of WASp<sup>+</sup> over WASp<sup>&#x02212;</sup> B cells and a decrease in cell numbers from the late transitional stage to the MZ B-cell compartment. This selective advantage is most evident in experiments analyzing B-cell intrinsic function: recipients of WASp<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> BM exhibited significantly fewer T2, MZP, and MZ B cells resulting in absolute reduction in the total number of splenic B cells. In contrast, WASp<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice exhibit a specific deficit in splenic MZP and MZ B cells, whereas the number of T2 cells is normal and the number of T1 B cells is modestly increased. This latter difference might reflect a B-cell extrinsic effect. Whereas we used young mice (6-8 weeks old) for all experiments, we cannot exclude that subclinical inflammatory processes might influence the B-cell phenotype in the WASp<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mouse model. In contrast, such factors are largely excluded in the transplant experiments because very few non-B cells are WASp-deficient in this model. Notably, whereas the absolute number of splenic FM B cells was normal in both WASp<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice and in our chimeric transplantation model, we readily observed reductions in mature recirculating B-cell numbers in the BM in both models. This suggests that, whereas ongoing homeostatic signals may be sufficient to maintain splenic FM B-cell numbers (as discussed in greater detail later in &#x0201c;Discussion&#x0201d;), BM recirculating B cells and naive B cells in other lymphoid compartments are probably more sensitive to cell loss.</p><p>The peritoneal B1 cell compartment was previously described as unaltered in WASp<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref></sup> In contrast, whereas there was no difference in B1 progenitors in the BM, we observed a significant decrease in both percentage and absolute number of B1a cells; and a strong selective advantage for WASp-expressing B1a and B1b cells. B1a B cells are crucial for protection against <italic>S pneumonia</italic>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref></sup> Thus, the increased susceptibility of WAS patients to encapsulated bacteria, which has also been described in WASp<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref></sup> may be largely explained by the reduced number of both MZ and B1a B cells. Consistent with these data, a recent study also demonstrated altered TI-type 2 immune responses in this strain.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref></sup></p><p>Importantly, several key features of our analysis were similar in both murine and human B cells. WASp expression was increased in mature versus immature/transitional human B cells and was highest in IgM<sup>+</sup> memory B cells, the functional, and possibly developmental, equivalent of murine MZ B cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref></sup> Moreover, analyzing blood from a WAS patient with a revertant mutation, we observed a proportional increase in WASp<sup>+</sup> cells in mature versus transitional B cells and further enrichment within the memory B-cell compartment, findings consistent with a selective advantage for WASp<sup>+</sup> follicular mature and memory B cells. Although we were unable to identify an enrichment of WASp<sup>+</sup> B cells within the IgM<sup>+</sup> memory compartment, the very low absolute numbers of total and IgM<sup>+</sup> memory B cells significantly limited this analysis. It is also possible that WASp<sup>+</sup> human IgM<sup>+</sup> memory B cells are preferentially localized to lymphoid compartments not available in our analysis.</p><p>Overall, our phenotypic data in humans and mice are in accord with previous studies in WAS: the number of total B cells and MZ B cells are decreased in both human WAS patients and WASp<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref></sup>; and similar to our observations in mice, a previous study also suggests that the relative percentage of immature peripheral B cells is increased in WAS patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref></sup></p><p>Our data clearly define the late transitional stage as the point at which WASp expression becomes crucial for B-cell function. We also addressed the critical question as to whether this reflects a developmental versus homeostatic defect. We excluded that impaired Notch signaling is the major reason for a diminished MZ B-cell compartment. Using in vivo BrdU labeling, we demonstrate significantly higher BrdU incorporation in splenic B-cell subsets, recirculating BM B cells, as well as B1 B cells, findings consistent with a higher turnover rate for each of these subpopulations. Notably, the absolute number of BrdU<sup>+</sup> MZ B cells was equal or even slightly higher in WASp<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> versus WT mice. This latter finding essentially excludes a developmental defect because the number of newly generated MZ B cells is comparable. Moreover, cell-cycle analysis revealed an increase in cycling cells (S- and G<sub>2</sub>/M-phase) in nearly all peripheral B-cell subsets in WASp<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. This feature was most pronounced in T2 B cells, the subset that is most highly responsive to homeostatic signals.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref></sup> These coordinate findings suggest that an increase in newly generated B cells can partially compensate for homeostatic cell losses that occur in WASp<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. Such compensation appears most efficient within the FM B-cell pool as overall FM B-cell numbers are not significantly reduced in WASp<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice.</p><p>Having excluded a developmental defect, we also tested whether key B cell&#x02013;intrinsic survival signals might be selectively impaired in WASp<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. Previous reports have suggested an increased rate of spontaneous apoptosis in human B cells derived from peripheral blood of WAS patients.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref></sup> However, conclusions from these and other studies using B cells from WASp<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice are difficult to interpret because nearly all were performed using heterogeneous populations or cell lines. BCR and BAFF-R signals coordinately provide the crucial homeostatic and survival signals for late transitional and mature B cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref></sup> Therefore, we tested both basal and/or receptor-mediated survival signals using highly purified, WT versus WASp<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> B-cell subsets. We were unable to identify any alterations in basal or receptor-triggered signals, including no differences in: relative receptor expression, cell survival, antiapoptotic signaling, Akt activation, or p100 processing.</p><p>The absence of a survival defect in WASp<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> B cells suggests that alternative defects in homeostasis probably account for the observed losses within the mature B-cell compartment. A previous study has shown a requirement for Pyk-2 driven, chemokine responses in MZ B-cell development,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref></sup> and recent work has identified defects in chemokine-driven WASp<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> B-cell migration.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref></sup> However, because the initial pool of both MZ precursor and mature MZ B cells is intact in WASp<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, altered migration alone seems doubtful to explain the selective loss of these subsets. Instead, we predict that signals that promote retention of MZP/MZ B cells within the MZ niche are probably deficient in WASp<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> animals. MZ B-cell localization requires up-regulation of LFA-1 and &#x003b1;4&#x003b2;1 integrins as well as signaling via Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptors.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref></sup> Transcript levels for S1P<sub>3</sub>, but not S1P<sub>1</sub>, were significantly decreased in MZ B cells from WASp<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (Figure S4). However, because S1P<sub>3</sub>-deficient mice exhibit normal MZ B-cell numbers,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref></sup> this observation alone cannot explain MZ B cell losses. In addition, WASp<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> MZ B cells express normal levels of LFA-1 and CD62L (data not shown) and show comparable ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 binding.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref></sup></p><p>Integrin signals are crucial for the retention of B cells within the MZ.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref></sup> Further, integrin binding can be directly influenced by BCR signaling, and such changes are probably important in regulating the MZ B-cell compartment. Using lipid bilayers, we show that WASp<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> B cells are able to aggregate antigen into cSMACs after receptor stimulation. However, WASp<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> B cells exhibit a near-complete deficit in integrin clustering in response to BCR and ICAM costimulation, as demonstrated by the failure to generate a stable pSMAC or to increase the cell:lipid bilayer contact area. BCR-driven signals promote a change from a low to high avidity integrin binding state, thereby enhancing B-cell adherence to local adhesion molecules.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref></sup> We hypothesize that the deficit in inside-out signaling shown herein limits retention of WASp<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> MZ B cells and thereby promotes MZ B-cell loss via reduced access to microenvironmental survival signals. This retention deficit probably also impacts additional WASp<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mature B-cell subsets. Thus, our combined data best support a model in which inefficient localization of B cells within key niches leads to an ongoing homeostatic defect. Direct measurement of integrin affinity in resting versus stimulated MZ B cells, as well as studies of in vivo positioning, are required to fully address this question.</p><p>In conclusion, the current study precisely defines the B-cell intrinsic defects in WASp deficiency. This work sets the stage for a better understanding of the clinical phenotype of WAS and provides new insight into the regulation of the mature peripheral B-cell compartment. In addition, we show, for the first time, that WASp<sup>+</sup> human and murine B cells exhibit a strong selective advantage. These observations suggest that future gene therapy strategies, leading to sustained endogenous levels of WASp expression in B lineage cells, might rescue these homeostatic defects and promote improved humoral immunity in WAS.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplemental Methods and Figures]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="blood-2008-02-140814_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="blood-2008-02-140814_1.pdf"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg" xlink:href="blood-2008-02-140814_FigureS1.jpg"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg" xlink:href="blood-2008-02-140814_FigureS2.jpg"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg" xlink:href="blood-2008-02-140814_FigureS3.jpg"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg" xlink:href="blood-2008-02-140814_FigureS4.jpg"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg" xlink:href="blood-2008-02-140814_FigureS5.jpg"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p>An Inside <italic>Blood</italic> analysis of this article appears at the front of this issue.</p></fn><fn fn-type="supplementary-material"><p>The online version of this article contains a data supplement.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p>The publication costs of this article were defrayed in part by page charge payment.
