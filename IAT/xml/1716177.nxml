P73 is highly similar to p53 at both the amino acid sequence and structural levels. Given their similarities, it is important to determine whether p53 and p73 function in similar or distinct pathways. There is abundant evidence for negative cross-talk between glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and p53. Neither physical nor functional interactions between GR and p73 have been reported. In this study, we examined the ability of p53 and p73 to interact with and inhibit GR transcriptional activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We show that both p53 and p73 can bind GR, and that p53 and p73-mediated transcriptional activity is inhibited by GR co-expression. Wild-type p53 efficiently inhibited GR transcriptional activity in cells expressing both proteins. Surprisingly, however, p73 was either unable to efficiently inhibit GR, or increased GR activity slightly. To examine the basis for this difference, a series of p53:p73 chimeric proteins were generated in which corresponding regions of either protein have been swapped. Replacing N- and C-terminal sequences in p53 with the corresponding sequences from p73 prevented it from inhibiting GR. In contrast, replacing p73 N- and C-terminal sequences with the corresponding sequences from p53 allowed it to efficiently inhibit GR.

Wild-type p53 is a transcription factor that binds the promoter regions of various target genes in a sequence-specific manner and activates their transcription. Some of these target genes are necessary for p53 to induce cell cycle arrest following stress, such as <italic>Waf1</italic>, which encodes the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor protein p21 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Other target genes are important for the apoptotic function of p53, including <italic>Bax</italic>, <italic>Fas</italic>/<italic>Apo1</italic>, <italic>PUMA</italic>, <italic>Noxa</italic>, and <italic>Apaf1 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Cancer-derived mutations in p53 block its sequence-specific DNA-binding capability, resulting in decreased expression of these growth-inhibitory target genes. This can lead to uncontrolled cell growth and eventual carcinogenesis.</p><p>P73 is a p53-related protein that shares a high degree of amino acid sequence identity with p53 and many of the same structural features [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Given their similarities, it is important to determine whether p53 and p73 carry out similar or distinct functions, and whether they are regulated through similar or different mechanisms. Both p53 and p73 contain an N-terminal transactivation domain (TAD) and proline-rich domain (PRD), a central DNA-binding domain (DBD), and a C-terminal oligomerization domain (OD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. P53 and p73 differ considerably in their extreme C-terminal sequences. The p53 extreme C-terminus (residues 364&#x02013;393) is a basic-charged region that contains a cluster of six lysine residues. These lysines are sites of post-translational modifications (acetylation, ubiquitination, neddylation, methylation) that can regulate p53 stability and transcriptional activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In contrast, p73 contains an extended C-terminus that can vary in length due to alternative splicing, and that has no sequence or structural homology with p53. P53 and p73 can carry out some redundant functions. For example, p73 can bind to and activate various p53 target genes, and can induce growth arrest or apoptosis when over-expressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Further, levels of endogenous p73 protein increase in response to certain stresses, as does p53, and this p73 can induce apoptosis in p53-null cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Despite these similarities, however, the consequence of p53 or p73 loss on development and cancer susceptibility is strikingly different. P53 loss-of-function mutations are found in over 50% or all human cancers, and p53-deficient mice develop multiple cancers and die at an early age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. This is consistent with p53s role as a <italic>bona fide </italic>tumor suppressor. In contrast, mutations in p73 are not commonly associated with cancer, and p73-deficient mice display neurological, pheromonal, and inflammatory defects without an apparent increased cancer incidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. These findings and others have suggested that p73 could play distinct roles in development that are not attributed to p53.</p><p>Glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is a nuclear receptor and ligand-dependent transcription factor (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]). GR belongs to the superfamily of steroid nuclear receptors that also includes estrogen receptor (ER), androgen receptor (AR), and progesterone receptor (PR). In the absence of ligand, GR is inactive and resides in the cytoplasm in complex with chaperones such as Hsp90. Ligand-binding promotes dissociation of GR from cytoplasmic complexes and its translocation to the nucleus, where it can then activate transcription of its target genes. The effect of activating GR appears to be cell-type specific. GR activation has been reported to promote survival and inhibit apoptosis in mammary epithelial cells, breast cancer cells, neuroblastoma cells, and other cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. In contrast, GR activation in thymocytes triggers apoptosis (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]). There is compelling evidence for cross-talk between GR and p53. Binding between GR and p53 has been demonstrated both <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo</italic>, and their interaction can lead to the mutual inhibition of both proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. The GR ligand dexamethasone has been reported to enhance binding between GR and p53 and, under certain conditions, to cause their cytoplasmic sequestration and degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Complexes of p53 and GR may also contain MDM2, a p53-responsive protein that can act as an E3 ubiquitin ligase to promote degradation of both p53 and GR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. These findings have suggested that GR could enhance survival by sequestering p53 in the cytoplasm and, conversely, that p53 might enhance cell death by sequestering GR in the cytoplasm and blocking its survival function. To date, neither physical nor functional interactions between GR and p73 have been described.</p><p>In the current study, we examined whether p73 could bind GR and participate in negative cross-talk with GR, similar to p53. We found that both p53 and p73 could bind GR, and that p53 and p73-mediated transcriptional activity was inhibited by GR co-expression. Wild-type p53 efficiently inhibited GR transcriptional activity in cells expressing both proteins. Surprisingly, however, p73 was either unable to effectively inhibit GR, or increased GR activity slightly. To examine the basis for this difference, we generated a series of p53:p73 chimeric proteins in which corresponding regions of either protein have been swapped. These studies revealed that N- and C-terminal regions of p53 and p73 contribute to their regulation of GR. Fusion of p53 N- and C-terminal sequences to p73 allowed p73 to inhibit GR and, conversely, fusion of p73 N- and C-terminal sequences to p53 prevented p53 from inhibiting GR. We conclude that the differential ability of p53 and p73 to inhibit GR is due, in part, to differences in their N-terminal and C-terminal sequences.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Both p53 and p73 can bind GR</title><p>P53, p73, and GR are each short-lived proteins that undergo proteasome-dependent degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. GR is targeted for proteasomal degradation in the presence of its activating ligand dexamethassone (Dex) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. P53 can bind GR and has also been reported to undergo enhanced degradation upon Dex-treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. We wished to test whether p73 can also bind GR. First, Saos-2 cells (p53-null) were transfected with DNAs encoding either GR only (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>), or co-transfected with GR and p53 or p73&#x003b2; (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Cells were then either untreated or treated with Dex for 17 hrs, followed by incubation for an additional 6 hrs in the presence or absence of the proteasome inhibitor MG132. GR levels decreased with Dex treatment when expressed alone or with p53 or p73&#x003b2;, and this decrease was partially blocked by MG132. P53 and p73 levels were similarly decreased in Dex treated cells, and this decrease was also partially blocked by MG132-treatment (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). The results suggest Dex treatment may enhance proteasomal degradation of p53, p73, and GR under these conditions.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Glucocorticoid receptor (GR) binding to p53 and p73</bold>. <italic>A </italic>and <italic>B</italic>, Saos-2 cells (p53-null) were transfected overnight with 200 ng GR DNA and 100 ng DNA encoding either p53 or p73&#x003b2;.

Transfected cells were then either untreated or treated with Dex for 17 hrs, followed by incubation for an additional 6 hrs in the presence or absence of MG132 to block their potential degradation.

Interestingly, binding between transfected GR and p53 or p73&#x003b2; was most evident in cells treated with MG132, suggesting the ability to detect GR complexes with p53 or p73 may be limited by their proteasomal degradation. p53 appeared to bind GR to a slightly greater extent than did p73&#x003b2;.</p></sec><sec><title>GR inhibits p53 and p73 transcriptional activity</title><p>Given that GR can bind p53 and p73, we wished to test whether GR could inhibit p53 or p73 transcriptional activity. To this end, Saos-2 cells were transfected with different p53 and p73-responsive luciferase reporter genes (pG13-luc, MDM2-luc, and p21-luc) either alone, or with p53, p73 and GR in different combinations. p53 or p73-dependent transactivation of these reporter genes was assessed. As shown in Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, p53 and p73 activated expression of each reporter gene. Co-expression of GR without Dex treatment, or treatment with Dex alone, had little or no effect on this p53 or p73-dependent activation. However, p53 and p73 activity was inhibited in each case when cells co-expressing GR were also treated with Dex. This indicates that GR, in the presence of its ligand (Dex), can inhibit the transcriptional activity of both p53 and p73.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>GR inhibits p53 and p73 transcriptional activity</bold>. <italic>A</italic>, Saos-2 cells were transfected with DNAs encoding p53 (50 ng), the indicated p53/p73-responsive reporter DNA (pG13-luc, p21-luc, or MDM2-luc, 100 ng each), and GR (100, 250, 500 ng for pG13-luc; 500 ng for p21-luc and MDM2-luc). 24 hrs after transfection, cells were untreated or treated with dexamethasone (100 nM) for an additional 20 hrs.

To test whether p73 can also inhibit GR activity, we monitored activation of a GR-responsive luciferase reporter gene (GR-luc, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) when GR was co-expressed with p53 or p73. GR-luc was not activated by GR expression alone (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>) or by Dex treatment alone. However, as shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>, GR-luc was highly activated when cells transfected with GR expression DNA were treated with Dex. Expression of p53 at increasing amounts inhibited the transcriptional activity of GR (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>), consistent with previous results. In contrast, and surprisingly, co-expression with increasing amounts of p73 inhibited GR either less efficiently than p53 or not at all, and low levels of transfected p73 actually increased GR activity (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>).

According to this model, p53 activates MDM2 gene expression, and increased levels of MDM2 protein then promotes GR and p53 degradation. We observed lower induction of MDM2 in cells expressing p73 compared to cells expressing p53 (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>), suggesting that the relative inability of p73 to inhibit GR might be due to its less efficient induction of MDM2. To test this possibility, we first monitored p53 inhibition of GR under conditions where endogenous MDM2 expression was inhibited by siRNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). The results show that p53 could still inhibit GR under conditions where MDM2 levels were decreased by siRNA, though knockdown of MDM2 diminished p53 inhibition of GR slightly. This suggested MDM2 may contribute to GR inhibition by p53, but is not absolutely required. Next, we monitored GR inhibition by p53 and p73 in MDM2/p53 double knockout (DKO) cells. p53 efficiently inhibited GR activity in these p53/MDM2 DKO cells, whereas p73 did not (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). Thus, the different ability of p53 and p73 to inhibit GR is observed even in the absence of MDM2 expression. Finally, we asked whether artificially increasing MDM2 levels would allow p73 to inhibit GR activity. To this end, GR activity was monitored in cells expressing increasing amounts of p73 either alone, or with increasing amounts of MDM2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). p73 was unable to inhibit GR activity when expressed alone or with MDM2, and MDM2 alone also had no effect on GR activity. Based on these results it appears that the differential ability of p53 and p73 to inhibit GR activity does not result from lesser induction of MDM2 by p73.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Role of MDM2 in GR inhibition by p53 and p73</bold>. <italic>A</italic>, Saos-2 cells were transfected with GR-luc DNA (200 ng) and increasing amounts of DNA encoding p53 (100, 250, 500, 750 ng).

Transcriptional activity of each clone was tested by monitoring activation of the p53 reporter gene pG13-luc in transfected cells (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8B</xref>). p53 (1&#x02013;363) had increased transcriptional activity compared to wild-type p53 (compare clones 1 and 5, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>), consistent with early and more recent reports that the p53 C-terminus harbors a transcription inhibitory domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. In contrast, p73 (1&#x02013;390) had lower transcriptional activity compared to wild-type p73&#x003b2;, consistent with reports that the p73 C-terminus harbors a transcriptional activation domain (TAD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Similarly, p53 with the p73 C-terminus (clone 9, Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>) had high transcriptional activity, consistent with the transcription inhibitory domain of p53 being replaced with the C-terminal transcriptional activation of p73. Finally, p73 with the p53 C-terminus (clone 10, Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>) had very low activity, consistent with replacement of its C-terminal transcriptional activation domain with the transcription inhibitory domain of p53. As expected, p53 and p73 that lacked N-terminal sequences (p53 &#x00394;1&#x02013;42 and p73 &#x00394;1&#x02013;54) lacked transcriptional activity due to deletion of their N-terminal TAD.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>p53 and p73 chimeric proteins</bold>. <italic>A</italic>, Schematic of the Flag-tagged p53 and p73 wild-type (wt) and chimeric proteins.

Interestingly, p73 (1&#x02013;390) did not increase GR activity as p73 wt did, and gained some ability to inhibit GR compared to p73 wt, especially at high input amounts. When equal protein expression levels were compared (as determined by densitometric scanning of films), p73 (1&#x02013;390) had a slightly lesser ability to inhibit GR than p53 (1&#x02013;363). These results indicate that 1) p53 C-terminal sequences are not absolutely required to inhibit GR, and 2) that p73 C-terminal sequences may contribute to GR activation by p73, and may limit p73s ability to inhibit GR. Next, we examined GR inhibition by the p53:p73 chimeric proteins in which the C-terminal sequences (C-term) have been swapped (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). p53 with the p73 C-term [p53(73&#x003b2;aa391&#x02013;499)] was still able to inhibit GR activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>).

Based on these results it appears that differences in the unique C-terminal sequences of p53 and p73 may only partially explain their different abilities to inhibit GR. It is important to note there is not a strict relationship between the transcriptional activity of p53 or p73 and their ability to inhibit GR. For example, p53 (1&#x02013;363) had increased transcriptional activity compared to p53 wt, but did not display increased ability to inhibit GR, while p73 (1&#x02013;390) had decreased transcriptional activity compared to p73 wt but inhibited GR to a slightly greater extent.

Chimeric proteins were also generated in which large N-terminal and C-terminal regions of p53 and p73 were swapped simultaneously (clones 15 and 16, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A</xref>). These chimeric clones displayed varying levels of transcriptional activity, as monitored by activation of the pG13-luc reporter (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8B</xref>). We first examined GR inhibition by the p53:p73 chimeric proteins in which both the oligo and C-terminal (C-term) sequences have been swapped (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9B</xref>). p53 with the p73 oligo and C-term [p53(73&#x003b2;aa328&#x02013;499)] was still able to inhibit GR activity, though with a slightly lesser ability than p53 wt at low input amounts. p73 with the p53 oligo and C-terminal domain [p73&#x003b2;(53aa290&#x02013;393)] could also inhibit GR.

Next, we examined GR inhibition by the p53:p73 chimeric proteins in which both the N-terminal TAD and proline rich domain (PRD) have been swapped (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F10">10B</xref>). p53 with the p73 TAD and PRD [p53(73&#x003b2;aa1&#x02013;113)] was still able to inhibit GR activity, though less well than p53 wt or p53 with only the p73 TAD swapped (compare GR inhibition in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C</xref> and Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9B</xref>).

When equal protein expression levels were compared, [p73&#x003b2;(53aa1&#x02013;97)] appeared to inhibit GR to a greater extent than [p53(73&#x003b2;aa1&#x02013;113)]. These results indicate the different abilities of p53 and p73 to inhibit GR may be explained in part, but not fully, by differences in their N-terminal sequences, including the TAD and PRD domains. Finally, we examined GR inhibition by p53:p73 chimeric proteins in which both N-terminal and C-terminal sequences have been swapped simultaneously (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11B</xref>). Strikingly, p53 with both the p73 N-terminus and C-terminus [p53(73&#x003b2;aa1&#x02013;113+328&#x02013;499)] was completely unable to inhibit GR activity and, like p73 wt, activated GR slightly at lower input amounts. In contrast, p73 with both the p53 N-terminus and C-terminus [p73&#x003b2;(53aa1&#x02013;97+290&#x02013;393)] efficiently inhibited GR at all input amounts, and to an extent similar to p53 wt. It is important to note that both these clones displayed comparable levels of transcriptional activity (clones 15 and 16, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8B</xref>). Further, co-immunoprecipitation experiments demonstrated that both chimeric proteins could bind GR to equal extents (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11D</xref>), indicating their different abilities to inhibit GR did not result from differences in GR binding.

Moreover, activation of endogenous GR by Dex treatment inhibited p53 induced cell cycle arrest in stressed cells, and activation of endogenous p53 by DNA damage inhibited GR transcriptional activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. These findings and others support the existence of negative cross-talk between the p53 and GR pathways. The GR-binding site in p53 has been mapped to the p53 DNA-binding domain (DBD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], and Dex treatement was reported to both enhance p53-GR binding and promote their proteasomal degradation to some extent. P53 and p73 are structurally similar and share high amino acid sequence identity in their DBD and other domains. However, to date, neither physical nor functional interactions between p73 and GR have been reported. In some but not all experiments, GR and p53 levels decreased upon Dex treatment in cells co-expressing both proteins, and this was partially blocked by proteasome inhibition. GR and p73 levels were also decreased in Dex-treated cells in some experiments (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). This suggests Dex treatment may promote proteasomal degradation of GR, p53, and p73. Our co-immunoprecipitation studies (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>) indicate that p73 can also bind GR, similar to p53. Interestingly, binding between GR and p53 or p73&#x003b2; was most evident in cells treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG132. This suggests the ability to detect GR complexes with p53 or p73 may be limited by their proteasomal degradation. Alternatively, MG132 may stabilize one or more factors that enhance the interaction between GR and either p53 or p73.</p><p>GR can inhibit the transcriptional activity of p53. To test whether GR can also inhibit the transcriptional activity of p73, we monitored the effect of GR co-expression on p53 and p73-dependent activation of different luciferase reporter genes. GR inhibited transactivation of all three reporter genes by p53 or p73 to comparable extents. Thus, p53 and p73 can bind GR, and the transcriptional activity of both proteins is inhibited by GR. We also monitored the effect of p53 or p73 co-expression on the transcriptional activity of GR. In all experiments, p53 caused a pronounced inhibition of GR activity. Surprisingly, however, p73 was either unable to efficiently inhibit GR, or activated GR slightly (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Thus, p53 and p73 can bind GR, but only p53 and not p73 can efficiently inhibit GR activity. One interesting possibility based on these results is that the mechanism by which GR inhibits p53 and p73 may be different from the mechanism by which p53 or p73 inhibits GR. Binding to p53 or p73 may be sufficient for GR to inhibit p53 and p73 activity. However, binding alone may not be sufficient for p53 or p73 to inhibit GR, since p73 can bind GR just as p53 can, but is unable to efficiently inhibit GR activity.</p><p>Wasylyk and colleagues reported one way in which p53 can inhibit GR is through its activation of MDM2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. According to this model, p53 activates MDM2 gene expression, and increased levels of MDM2 protein then promote the degradation of both p53 and GR. We observed that p53 could still efficiently inhibit GR activity either when endogenous MDM2 levels were decreased via siRNA, or in MDM2/p53 double-knockout cells. While MDM2 may contribute to GR inhibition by p53, our results indicate p53 can also inhibit GR through an MDM2-independent mechanism. P73 induced lower levels of MDM2 than did p53. However, p73 remained unable to inhibit GR activity when expressed with increasing amounts of MDM2, and MDM2 alone also had no effect on GR activity. These results indicate the different abilities of p53 and p73 to inhibit GR results from something other than differences in MDM2 levels.</p><p>We considered two possibilities might explain the different abilities of p53 and p73 to inhibit GR. First, p53 may contain one or more unique sequence elements that are absent from p73, and that allow p53 to inhibit GR. Second, p73 may contain one or more unique sequence elements that are missing from p53, and that prevent p73 from inhibiting GR. To investigate these possibilities, a series of p53:p73 chimeric proteins were generated in which corresponding regions of either protein have been swapped (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8A</xref>). The high degree of structural homology between p53 and p73 should allow one to switch the various domains of each protein without disrupting protein conformation. This approach was used previously by Yuan and colleagues to identify specific sequence elements in p53 that confer its degradation by MDM2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Our studies revealed that replacing C-terminal domains (oligo and C-term) in p53 with the corresponding domains of p73 had little effect, or only slightly diminished, the ability of p53 to inhibit GR. Conversely, deleting the unique C-terminus of p73, or replacing C-terminal domains (oligo and C-term) in p73 with the corresponding domains of p53 allowed p73 to inhibit GR to a large extent. Replacing the N-terminal domains (TAD and PRD) in p53 with the corresponding domains of p73 diminished the ability of p53 to inhibit GR, whereas replacing the N-terminal domains in p73 with the corresponding domains of p53 allowed p73 to inhibit GR to some extent. These results suggested that the different abilities of p53 and p73 to inhibit GR can be explained in part, but not fully, by individual differences in their N- and C-terminal sequences. Confirmation of this came from analysis of p53:p73 chimeric proteins in which their N- and C-terminal sequences were swapped simultaneously (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F11">11</xref>). Replacement of p53s N- and C-terminal sequences with the N- and C-terminal sequences of p73 at the same time completely blocked its ability to inhibit GR, while replacement of p73s N- and C-terminal sequences with the N- and C-terminal sequences of p53 at the same time allowed it to efficiently inhibit GR. Importantly, the different ability of these chimeric proteins to inhibit GR was not due to differences in their transcriptional activity or ability to bind GR. The results suggest that p53 N- and C-terminal sequences contribute to its inhibition of GR, since these sequences cannot be replaced by the corresponding sequences of p73. In contrast, p73 N- and C-terminal sequences appear to prevent GR inhibition, since deletion of C-terminal sequences from p73 restored some ability to inhibit GR, and replacing p53s N- and C-terminal sequences with those of p73 blocked p53 from inhibiting GR. This raises the question of how the N- and C-terminal sequences of p53 or p73 might participate in GR inhibition. A recent study suggested that p53 could repress transcription of the IGFBP-1 gene through recruitment of a histone deacetylase (HDACs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Interestingly, this recruitment of HDAC required both N-terminal and C-terminal sequences in p53. Perhaps p53 can bind GR on promoter DNA and repress its activity through N- and C-terminal sequences and HDAC recruitment. p73 might lack the ability to recruit HDAC protein(s) or only recruit HDACs inefficiently, accounting for its inability to inhibit GR.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>p53 and p73 transcriptional activity is inhibited by glucocorticoid receptor (GR) co-expression. However, whereas wild-type p53 efficiently inhibits GR transcriptional activity, p73 is either unable to efficiently inhibit GR, or increases GR activity slightly. These differences are not due to differences in the ability of p53 and p73 to either bind GR, or activate MDM2 gene expression. Analysis of multiple p53:p73 chimeric proteins revealed that the differential ability of p53 and p73 to inhibit GR is due to differences in their N-terminal and C-terminal sequences.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Plasmid DNAs</title><p>HA-tagged and Flag-tagged p53 wt DNAs were described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>].

Where indicated, the proteasome inhibitor MG132 (Boston Biochem) was added to a final concentration of 30 &#x003bc;M and the cells incubated for an additional 6 hrs before harvesting.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunoprecipitations and Immunoblotting</title><p>To harvest cell lysates for immunoblotting, cells were rinsed with 2 ml PBS and then scraped into 500 &#x003bc;l lysis buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% NP40, PMSF, leupeptin) and transferred to microfuge tubes. The cells were then incubated on ice for 30 min with occasional vortexing, and spun at 4&#x000b0;C, 14,000 rpm for 15 min to remove cellular debris. For co-immunoprecipitations, lysates were immunoprecipitated overnight with 200 ng anti-GR polyclonal antibody (clone E-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology). GR immunoprecipitates were isolated on protein A agarose beads as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. For immunoblotting, protein lysates or GR immunoprecipitates were resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and transferred to PVDF membranes for immunoblotting. Antibodies used in immunoblotting included anti-HA monoclonal antibody (HA.11, Covance), anti-Flag monoclonal antibody Ab-5 (Sigma-Aldrich), anti-GR polyclonal antibodies (E-20 and P-20, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-MDM2 monoclonal antibody SMP-14 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).</p></sec><sec><title>Luciferase Assays</title><p>To monitor p53 and p73 transcriptional activity, Saos-2 cells were transfected with 100 ng of each luciferase reporter DNA (pG13-luc, p21-luc, MDM2-luc) and 50 ng DNA encoding Flag p53 wt or Flag p73&#x003b2; wt. In some cases, GR DNA was included in the transfection (100, 250, 500, or 1000 ng) and cells were treated with Dex (100 nM) for 16&#x02013;20 hrs before harvesting. To monitor GR transcriptional activity, cells were transfected overnight with 200 ng GR-luc DNA and 100 ng DNA encoding GR. Cells were then treated with Dex (100 nM) for 20&#x02013;24 hrs before harvesting. In some cases, p53 wt or p73 wt, or the various chimeric proteins were included in the transfection. PRL-TK DNA (5 ng) was included in each transfection as a normalization control. Luciferase activity was monitored using the dual-luciferase reporter assay kit (Promega Corp.), according to the manufacturers protocol. P53 and p73 protein expression levels were compared in these luciferase experiments by densitometric scanning of films using Image-J software. This allowed comparison of GR-luc activity under conditions of comparable p53 and p73 protein expression.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>LZ carried out the bulk of the experiments described in this study.
