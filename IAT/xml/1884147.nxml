The link between VEGF and survivin during zebrafish angiogenesis has not been examined but may involve PKB/Akt signaling as reported in human endothelial cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Intriguingly, co-injecting embryos with survivin mRNA could only rescue the vascular defects seen in Sur<sub>UTR+ATG</sub><sup>MO </sup>embryos but not in embryos treated with a VEGF receptor inhibitor. Therefore, additional downstream mediators may be involved in the angiogenic effects of VEGF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Reversely, whether VEGF can rescue the angiogenesis defects in Sur<sub>UTR+ATG</sub><sup>MO </sup>embryos has not been examined. Perturbation of VEGF signaling may also result in changes in blood vessel synthesis and the observed changes in survivin mRNA may reflect changes in endothelial cell number rather than a direct mechanistic link to VEGF signaling. This issue would have to be evaluated in future study.</p><p>Both human and murine studies have demonstrated that survivin is involved in haematopoietic stem and progenitor cell proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. However, in the present study, early specification of hematopoietic progenitors in the Sur<sub>UTR+ATG</sub><sup>MO </sup>embryos was not affected, as shown by the normal expression of genes encoding for hematopoietic transcription factors and embryonic hemoglobins, as well as the normal distribution of gata1<sup>+ </sup>population in <italic>Tg(gata1:GFP) </italic>embryos at 18 hpf, before the onset of functional circulation (data not shown).</p><p>That the targeting of the <italic>survivin </italic>MOs was specific was shown using several control studies. First, the phenotypic changes seen in Sur<sub>UTR+ATG</sub><sup>MO </sup>embryos were similar to those observed in <italic>survivin </italic>mutants generated by retrovirus insertional mutagenesis screening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Indeed, it would be valuable to examine this mutant for similar defects in angiogenesis. Second, co-injecting Sur<sub>UTR+ATG</sub>-MO with a 5'UTR-survivin:GFP plasmid inhibited translation and hence green fluorescence induced by the latter in all embryos, proving efficacious binding of Sur<sub>UTR+ATG</sub>-MO to the 5'UTR-survivin mRNA. Third, the angiogenesis defects of ISV induced by Sur<sub>UTR+ATG</sub>-MO could be rescued by <italic>survivin </italic>mRNA. Whether the defects in SIV and OV/IOC were similarly reversed and whether injection of survivin mRNA alone would induce angiogenesis defects would have to be further examined. Finally a splice-site morpholino recapitulated the phenotypes seen with Sur<sub>UTR+ATG</sub>-MO. Therefore, the angiogenesis defects in Sur<sub>UTR+ATG</sub><sup>MO </sup>embryos represent a specific phenotype due to knock-down of <italic>survivin </italic>function in zebrafish embryos.</p><p>In human, murine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] as well as Xenopus embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], <italic>survivin </italic>is ubiquitously expressed. These observations, together with the fact that the developing head and eye of the Sur<sub>UTR+ATG</sub><sup>MO </sup>embryos were reduced in size have raised a concern whether the angiogenesis defects in these embryos might be caused by a general developmental defect and cell death, rather than a specific requirement for survivin function. However, in zebrafish embryos, <italic>survivin </italic>is more robustly expressed in the axial vasculature as well as the developing brain and neural tube. This observation has been confirmed by histological sectioning as well as double <italic>in-situ </italic>hybridization in which the pattern of <italic>survivin </italic>expression showed remarkable similarity to that of <italic>flk1</italic>, a marker of vascular endothelium. We cannot exclude a low level but diffuse expression of <italic>survivin </italic>in adjacent tissues but this should not negate the specific role of survivin during angiogenesis. First, we have confined our examination to the Sur<sub>UTR+ATG</sub><sup>MO </sup>embryos with characteristic phenotypes and none of them showed overt tissue necrosis at 48 hpf. The 20% embryos with severe deformity have been excluded from analysis. Second, we demonstrated that embryonic development is not overtly delayed in the Sur<sub>UTR+ATG</sub><sup>MO </sup>embryos as shown by the normal onset and pattern of pigmentation and heart beat (data not shown). Finally, in the present study, survivin expression appeared to be under VEGF regulation, providing a possible link between VEGF and embryonic angiogenesis. Our findings were also consistent with those by Pasquier et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] in which over-expression of survivin in Xenopus embryos induces endothelial cell proliferation <italic>in-vivo</italic>.</p><p>Several observations in this study have remained unexplained. For instance, we did not observe a direct causal link between increased apoptosis and the angiogenesis defect in the Sur<sub>UTR+ATG</sub><sup>MO </sup>embryos. Apoptosis was detectable not only in the axial vasculature, but also in the developing brain and neural tube of the Sur<sub>UTR+ATG</sub><sup>MO </sup>embryos. Both <italic>in-vivo </italic>and <italic>in-vitro </italic>studies have demonstrated that in addition to its anti-apoptotic function, survivin plays an important role in the regulation of cellular proliferation and cytokinesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Recent study in Xenopus embryos also showed that <italic>survivin </italic>expression induces endothelial cell proliferation independent of apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Therefore, the relative modest TUNEL staining in the axial vasculature did not preclude the role of survivin in angiogenesis. It is also possible that survivin plays a non-cell autonomous role in the angiogenesis process. Childs et al. (2002) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] demonstrated in zebrafish embryos the migration of angioblasts from the aorta to the dorsal aspect of the neural tube and to the inter-phase between notochord and the somites, where they develop into DLAV and ISV. Therefore, vascular patterning may depend on signaling cues that direct the site of angiogenesis sprouts. Whether the occurrence of apoptosis in the developing neural tube might have perturbed these signals hence the formation of DLAV and ISV would have to be carefully examined. The proposition may also explain the lack of robust expression at the site of ISV and DLAV in wild-type embryos. Furthermore, although <italic>survivin </italic>is expressed robustly in the axial vasculature, concomitant expression was noted in the developing central nervous system. The expression of survivin within these structures needs to be defined in future study. Moreover, the developing eye and head structures in the survivin morphants are generally smaller. Whether this reflected changes secondary to defective angiogenesis or alternative functions of survivin during development have not been elucidated. Finally, survivin gene in zebrafish has undergone duplication during evolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] and the function of the duplicated gene would have to be further investigated. Notwithstanding these limitations, our data still supported the proposition that survivin is involved in the regulation of angiogenesis during zebrafish development.</p><p><italic>Survivin </italic>is strongly expressed in both solid organ and hematological malignancies where it is associated with treatment failure and a poor prognosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Loss of function studies have also demonstrated that <italic>survivin </italic>expression is linked to angiogenesis and tumorigenesis in gastric and colonic cancers and has become a potential target for anti-cancer therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Our observation that survivin regulates angiogenesis in zebrafish embryos highlights the relevance of using zebrafish embryos in the screening for survivin-based anti-cancer agents.</p><p>In summary, we demonstrate that survivin plays an important role in angiogenesis during embryonic development and may be one of the down-stream effectors of VEGF signaling. Early hematopoiesis was not affected but the role of survivin during late hematopoiesis remains to be determined.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Zebrafish and morpholinos</title><p>Wild-type zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>) were obtained from local aquarium and were maintained and raised under standard conditions at 28&#x000b0;C.
