TIPT2 is widely expressed in mouse embryonic and adult tissues, residing both in cyto- and nucleoplasma, and enriched in the nucleolus. Like Geminin, also TIPT2 interacts with several polycomb factors, with the general transcription factor TBP (TATA box binding protein), and with the related protein TBPL1 (TRF2). TIPT2 synergizes with geminin and TBP in the activation of TATA box-containing promoters, and with TBPL1 and geminin in the activation of the TATA-less NF1 promoter. Geminin and TIPT2 were detected in the chromatin near TBP/TBPL1 binding sites.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Together, our study introduces a novel transcriptional regulator and its function in cooperation with chromatin associated factors and the basal transcription machinery.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The core promoter is defined as the genomic region required for recruitment of the transcription apparatus and can be considered as the priming stage for transcription initiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Recruitment of RNA polymerase II requires the assembly of a preinitiation complex, including the basal transcription factors TFIIA, B, D, E, F and H near the transcriptional start site(s) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. In addition, transcriptional regulation often involves TAFs (TATA-associated factors), mediator complex(es), and positive or negative cofactors, which associate with cis-acting DNA sequences often located further upstream or sometimes downstream of the start site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Only 10&#x02013;20% of the promoters in mammals, Drosophila and Arabidopsis contain a TATA box, a conserved AT-rich sequence motif approximately 30 bp upstream from the first transcribed nucleotide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In mammals, this minority of promoters is often associated with tissue-specific genes and high conservation across species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The TATA box associates with TBP, the TATA box binding protein, which as an element of the TFIID factor also binds to many TATA-less promoters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Genomic screening approaches in yeast suggest that the presence of TBP in the chromatin near a promoter does not necessarily correspond to transcriptional activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The adenovirus major late promoter (AdMLP) is a classical example for a TATA box promoter. It contains immediately upstream and downstream of the box additional protein binding sequences, the G-rich TFIIB recognition elements (BREs), which were also found in TATA-less promoters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>A TBP-like factor, TBPL1 (TLP/TLF/TRF2) has no affinity to the TATA box, but binds to other promoter elements, probably with a TBP-like function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. It was found in association with several promoters, e.g. of the <italic>PCNA</italic>, the <italic>wee1</italic>, the <italic>neurofibromytosis type 1 </italic>(<italic>NF1</italic>), the <italic>histone H1</italic>, and several ribosomal protein genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. However, no common binding motif could so far be delineated in mammals or Drosophila.</p><p>Geminin is a cell cycle regulatory protein, which functions through an interaction with the replication licensing factor Cdt1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. In addition, it was identified as a binding partner of developmental control proteins. It represses Hox functions during embryogenesis by direct association with Polycomb members on Hox regulatory chromatin elements, and by impairing Hox protein action on target genes through direct binding to the homeodomain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. In a similar way, geminin directly interacts and antagonizes the role of another homeobox protein, Six3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. It represses the activator function of pro-neural basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors neurogenin 2 and NeuroD on their target neuron-specific genes by sequestering Brg1, the catalytic subunit of the chromatin remodeling complex SWI/SNF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Alternatively, geminin represses neuronal gene transcription in non-neural cells through its association with the AP4 transcription factor, by recruiting the co-repressor SMRT and histone deacetylase HDAC3 to neuronal gene promoters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].</p><p>Here, we describe the function of TIPT2, a protein we identified through its interaction with geminin. Both geminin and TIPT2 bind to the basic transcriptional machinery, and can activate transcription synergistically. They were found, alone or together, associated with the chromatin of specific promoters.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We previously identified the polycomb factor Scmh1 and the homeodomain proteins Hoxd10 and Hoxa11 as geminin binding partners in a yeast two-hybrid screen of a day 8.5 mouse embryo cDNA library [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. In the same screen, a strongly interacting protein was identified, encoded by a 715 bp, poly(A)-tailed cDNA, corresponding to the Riken cDNA clone 5133400G04 [GenBank:<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="NM_029485">NM_029485</ext-link>]. A database entry identified the protein as isoform 2 of "TIPT" (TATA-binding protein-like factor-interacting protein), more recently named TRF2 interacting protein in testis [GenBank:<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AAV97890">AAV97890</ext-link>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. TIPT is encoded by three differentially spliced variants, TIPT isoform 1 [GenBank:<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AAV97890">AAV97890</ext-link>] (185 amino acids), TIPT isoform 2 [GenBank:<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AAH60950">AAH60950</ext-link>] (205 amino acids) and TIPT isoform 3 [GenBank:<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="BAB30197">BAB30197</ext-link>](159 amino acids). Mammalian TIPTs are strongly conserved, often represented by several isoforms, but related proteins were not found in other vertebrates or Drosophila. There are no similarities to other known proteins, and no conserved domain was obvious. Two coiled-coil regions (amino acids 50&#x02013;106 and 128&#x02013;168), known to be protein-protein interaction sites, were predicted by the Simple Modular Architecture Research Tool program <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://smart.embl-heidelberg.de/"/>.</p><sec><title>TIPT2 expression</title><p>RNA from murine tissues was analyzed by Northern blotting. A transcript corresponding in length to isoform 2 of TIPT was found in all studied tissues (adult heart, brain, liver, spleen, kidney, lung, thymus, testes, ovary, and day 14 embryo), with particular abundance in testis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). RNA from younger embryonic stages was checked for the presence of TIPT2 mRNA by RT-PCR. Significant transcript levels were detected in day 7.5 and 8.5 embryos, and even more abundant levels in day 9.5, 10.5, and 11.5 embryos (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). A polyclonal antibody was generated for further descriptive and functional analysis using for immunization the full-length mouse protein, cleaved from the purified <italic>E.coli </italic>recombinant GST-TIPT2 protein with thrombin, SDS-PAGE gel-purified, and verified by mass spectroscopy (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Immuno-purified antibodies detected the affinity-purified tagged and untagged bacterially expressed proteins (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>), and also the endogenous TIPT2 from HeLa or U2OS whole cell extract (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). The detection of TIPT2 on Western blots could be blocked by GST-TIPT2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). The major protein band detected by anti-TIPT2 antibodies in unfractionated extracts from HeLa, U2OS and other cells, and in organ extracts from newborn mice migrated slightly slower than the calculated size of 23,500 Da (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D, E</xref>, data not shown). The anti-TIPT2 antibody detected a larger sized protein band on some Western blots of gel purified TIPT2, and of protein extracts generated from mouse organs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>, data not shown). After transfection of plasmids encoding tagged versions of TIPT2 the same bands were detected by anti-TIPT2 or anti-Tag antibodies (data not shown). After immunoprecipitation of HA-TIPT2 with HA antibodies the same pattern was detected by either anti-HA or anti-TIPT2 antibodies, and mass spectroscopy indicated HA-TIPT2 as the major precipitated protein (data not shown).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>RNA and protein expression of TIPT2</bold>.

There, it co-localized with nucleolar markers, such as the basal transcription factor TBPL1, nucleophosmin (NPM), and the 15.5 K protein (Snu13p in yeast) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>].

To better characterize this interaction, the geminin binding site for TIPT2 was delineated by peptide array mapping. Binding of His-geminin to TIPT2 peptides revealed a basic amino acid rich region, close to the C-terminus of protein (KRKK, amino acids 185&#x02013;189; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). Indeed, a mutated GST-TIPT2 protein (TIPT2m; KRKK to DRDK) did not bind <italic>in vitro </italic>translated geminin (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). Since geminin interacts with polycomb proteins, we checked also TIPT2 for a potential interaction. <italic>In vitro </italic>pull-down assays indicated the binding of Scmh1, Mph2, and Ring1B, but not of Mel18 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). In addition, the interaction of TIPT2 with itself was demonstrated <italic>in vitro</italic>. The nucleolar localization of TIPT2 and TBPL1, and the above mentioned database entry prompted us to analyze a possible interaction of TIPT2 with factors of the basal transcription machinery. <italic>In vitro</italic>, TIPT2 interacted directly with both TBP and TBPL1, and with TFIIB (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). Because geminin binds TIPT2 and the latter binds basal transcription factors, geminin's interaction with TBP and TBPL1 was explored. The pull-down assay showed binding to both TBP family members, but not to TFIIB (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>). Further assays were performed in order to demonstrate the interaction of bacterially synthesized GST fusion proteins with endogenous proteins of cell lysates. Ponceau staining indicated equal inputs of GST proteins (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref>). From an adult testis extract, both TBP and Geminin could be pulled-down with GST-TIPT2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2F</xref>), and endogenous TBP could also be bound by GST-Geminin. However, endogenous TIPT2 could not be pulled-down by GST-Geminin, possibly because of an inhibitory effect of the GST tag. TBP in cell lysates prepared from human U2OS cells was pulled-down by both GST-TIPT2 and GST-Geminin (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2G</xref>). In order to study the <italic>in vivo </italic>interaction of TIPT2 and TBP transfected cells were analyzed by co-immunoprecipitation. Anti-HA antibodies precipitated HA-TIPT2 together with endogenous TBP from a stable, HA-TIPT2 expressing cell line (HA-TIPT8; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2H</xref>). In summary, we provide evidence that both TIPT2 and geminin bind members of the polycomb complex as well as basal transcription factors.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Interaction partners of TIPT2 and geminin (Gmnn)</bold>.

In a gel shift assay, TIPT2 bound strongly to the TATA box-containing AdMLP (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>, lanes 2,3). The interaction was highly specific and could be competed by cold AdMLP oligonucleotides, but not by high amounts of non-specific competitors (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). Multiple bands were detected in the gel shift assay, suggesting that TIPT2 may not only interact with DNA as a monomer, but in addition more than one TIPT2 monomer or a multimer may bind to the AdMLP oligonucleotide. The migration of TBP or GST-TIPT2 bound proteins to AdMLP was retarded when anti-TBP, respectively anti-GST monoclonal antibodies were added to the binding reactions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>, lanes 3,5). An AdMLP oligonucleotide with a mutated TATA box (AdMLPm1; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E</xref>) was still recognized by TIPT2, but not by human TBP (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>, lanes 3,4). TIPT2 did not bind to an oligonucleotide representing the AdE4 promoter (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>], to which TBP bound strongly (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>, lanes 5,6). These data indicate that TIPT2 does not interact with TATA box sequences, and TBP requires a bona fide TATA box. The AdMLP contains G-rich BRE elements flanking the TATA box [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. To reveal the location of the TIPT2 binding site, sequential mutations were introduced into the BRE elements of AdMLP (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E</xref>). The binding was impaired only for AdMLPm3, where the central GG sequence of the BRE upstream (BRE<sup>u</sup>) element was substituted by TT (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>, lanes 5,6; 3E). In contrary, the mutations AdMLPm2 and m4&#x02013;m9 still bound directly to TIPT2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>, lanes 3,4 and 7&#x02013;18). The binding of TIPT2 to AdMLP was competed with the cold oligonucleotides AdMLPm2&#x02013;m9. Mutants of the BRE<sup>u </sup>element (m2, m3, m4) did not compete for AdMLP binding (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3F</xref>, lanes 4&#x02013;9), whereas mutations in the TATA box (m5, m6) or in the BRE<sup>d </sup>element (m7, m8, m9) competed well for AdMLP binding (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3F</xref>, lanes 10&#x02013;19). Together, these findings emphasized the importance of the BRE<sup>u </sup>element, in particular its center position, for the binding of TIPT2. In this context potential interaction partners of TFIIB were explored. In a pull-down assay we observed that TIPT2, but not geminin associated with TFIIB (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C, D</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Binding of TIPT2 and/or TBP to TATA box-containing promoters</bold>.

Transfecting in addition to TBP also TIPT2, TIPT2m (containing a mutated geminin binding site) or geminin enhanced the activation of the reporter only marginally (2&#x02013;3 fold; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). In comparison, the co-transfection of geminin with TIPT2, but not TIPT2m (p-value &#x0003c; 0,001), was much more effective (11 fold). An optimal activation level (16 fold) was observed in triple transfections, when TBP, TIPT2 and geminin were introduced together. This effect was attenuated when TIPT2m instead of TIPT2 (p-value &#x0003c; 0,001), or TBPL1 instead of TBP (p-value &#x0003c; 0,001) were applied in triple transfections (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). Replacing Geminin by a mutant lacking the coiled-coil domain (Gmnn m2) did not change the synergistic effect in triple transfections, indicating that it did not result from a perturbation of the cell cycle or of DNA replication. Transfection of a Geminin mutant lacking the binding domain for Brg-1 (Gmnn m3) did not reduce the activity, but resulted in a slight enhancement (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Geminin cooperates with TIPT2 and TBP to activate TATA box-containing promoters</bold>.

The background level achieved with single or double transfections was slightly elevated when TIPT2 and geminin vectors were transfected together (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). Here, differences between the wild-type AdMLP reporter and reporters with a mutation in either the TIPT2-binding BRE element, or the TBP-binding TATA box were not recognizable. Double transfections did not produce a significant difference between the luciferase activities of BRE<sup>u </sup>mutant or TATA box mutant and wild type AdML promoter (p-value &#x0003e; 0,01). Maximal luciferase activities were obtained in triple transfections using the wild-type form. Both the TATA box and BRE<sup>u </sup>mutated promoters gave lower activation levels compared to the wild-type promoter (p-value &#x0003c; 0,001, respectively &#x0003c; 0,01; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>).</p><p>To investigate if TIPT2, TBP and geminin also activated a different TATA-containing promoter, the herpes virus thymidine kinase (TK) promoter was assayed, which does not contain a BRE element upstream of its TATA box. Still, the transfection results were quite similar to the AdMLP data. Single transfection of TBP, TIPT2 or geminin, as well as double transfections of TBP/TIPT2 or TBP/geminin activated expression only marginally (2&#x02013;4 fold; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>). Triple transfections of TBP, TIPT2, and geminin activated the reporter very strongly (29 fold) and synergistically. This effect was TBP-specific, because it could not be obtained by adding TBPL1 (p-value &#x0003c; 0.01; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E</xref>).</p><p>The indicated reporter assays were realized in the presence of endogenous TIPT2, geminin and TBP, all three proteins being present in the U2OS cell line. We tried to knock-down endogenous TIPT2 using various small interfering (si) RNAs and short hairpin constructs. While TIPT2 RNA levels could be decreased more than 80%, the protein levels were not significantly affected even after several days and repeated siRNA transfection (data not shown). However, endogenous geminin levels could be knocked-down efficiently with specific siRNA molecules (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4G</xref>). The experiments indicated that both single (TBP; p-value &#x0003c; 0,001) and double overexpressions (TIPT2/TBP; p-value &#x0003c; 0,001) were reduced in the absence of geminin (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4F</xref>). Together, these results suggest that TIPT2 synergizes with geminin and TBP in order to activate TATA-containing promoters, both in the presence or absence of a TIPT2 binding DNA sequence element. We see significant, logic changes in the activation of TATA promoters in response to different protein combinations. It is however apparent, that we did not necessarily observe a complete abrogation, if one factor was missing, mutated, or its binding site was removed.</p></sec><sec><title>Association of TIPT2 and TBPL1-TFIIA with the neurofibromin promoter</title><p>Recently, the binding of TBPL1 to a 103 bp fragment of the NF1 promoter was demonstrated <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. It was shown that TBPL1 binds to this promoter on two different sites and that TBPL1 shifts DNA in complex with TFIIA. We purified the TBPL1-TFIIA complex from cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts of a HeLa cell line stably overexpressing Flag tagged TBPL1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. The NF1 oligonucleotide was retarded significantly by this protein fraction (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>, lane 4), while geminin did not bind to it (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>, lane 2), and TIPT2 produced bands, which however were not completely competed for by cold oligonucleotides (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>, lane 3). Incubation of increasing amounts of TIPT2 with the NF1 oligonucleotide in the presence of TBPL1-TFIIA resulted in the appearance of a novel, slower migrating band, suggesting the binding of TIPT2 and TBPL1-TFIIA on the same oligonucleotide (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>, lanes 5,6). An influence of geminin on the TIPT2/TBPL1-TFIIA/NF1 complex could not be demonstrated clearly by an electrophoretic mobility shift. Together, these data indicate that TIPT2 associates with TBPL1-TFIIA on the TATA-less NF1 promoter.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Binding and activation of the NF1 promoter by TIPT2 and TBPL1</bold>.

TBPL1, TIPT2 or geminin alone were not capable of activating the reporter significantly (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). TIPT2 and geminin together produced already a significant increase (20 fold), and the additional inclusion of TBPL1 led to a very strong, synergistic activation (44 fold; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). Replacing TBPL1 by TBP revealed that the triple combination TBP/TIPT2/geminin was not more active than just TIPT2/geminin (p-value &#x0003c; 0,001), indicating that NF1 activation was TBPL1-specific (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). A knock-down of endogenous geminin decreased the activity of the NF1 reporter in the presence of exogenous TBPL1 or TIPT2/TBPL1 to levels significantly below the control background in the absence of any siRNA transfected, by a factor of about 4 (p-value &#x0003c; 0,01, respectively &#x0003c; 0,001) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref>). This result suggests that medium levels of activation in the absence of transfected geminin benefited from the presence of endogenous geminin. In summary, we show that TIPT2, TBPL1 and geminin activate the TATA-less NF1 promoter construct synergistically.</p></sec><sec><title>The presence of TIPT2 and/or geminin in specific chromatin</title><p>The chromatin of TBP or TBPL1 dependent genes, possessing either TATA box or TATA-less promoters, was assayed by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) using <italic>in vivo </italic>dual-cross-linking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. For this purpose the stable U2OS line generated, which produced HA-TIPT2 at levels similar to the endogenous protein (clone HA-TIPT8; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>) was used. The TATA box-containing regions of the investigated promoters were positive for TBP and acetylated histone H3 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>).

However, on the GAPDH promoter both TIPT2 and geminin were found. The TATA-less NF1 promoter region that includes two TBPL1 binding sites was positive for acetylated H3K9K14, geminin and TIPT2. The PCR band indicating the presence of TBP had the same intensity as for the other TATA-containing promoters, but was not enriched in comparison with mouse IgG. Thus, it had to remain inconclusive, if TBP is present in the chromatin of the NF1 promoter. These results indicate that TIPT2 and geminin are present alone or together, on the chromatin of some, but not all tested promoters.</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>Geminin and TIPT2 in the chromatin of TATA box-containing and TATA-less promoter regions</bold>.

These authors describe expression in male germ cells, interaction with TBPL1 (TRF2), DNA binding and association with chromatin, in line with our findings on isoform 2. However, they did not detect the widespread expression we saw on the RNA and protein level for isoform 2, although probe and antibodies would be expected to crossreact.</p><p>In our study, we describe the synergistic function of two interacting factors, TIPT2 and geminin, in the activation of transcription. TIPT2 and geminin have in common that they can interact with polycomb group members (PcGs), which are known for their function in the maintenance of gene repression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. Therefore, it came unexpected that PcGs were found together with the basal transcriptional machinery on repressed promoters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. It lead to the hypothesis that PcG proteins maintain silencing by inhibiting general transcription factor-mediated activation of transcription by interfering with the formation of the preinitiation complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. Our findings suggest that TIPT2 and geminin could be involved in the transition from inactive to active transcription via association with basal transcription as well as Polycomb factors. We found both geminin and TIPT2 in the chromatin of transcribed genes. TIPT2 was significantly enriched in nucleoli, a subcellular localization shared by the bHLH transcription factor Hand1, the basal transcription factor TBPL1, by <italic>Drosophila </italic>testis-specific TAF homologs and, albeit as an exception, by some PcGs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. For the nuclear geminin, on the other hand, a nucleolar localization was not specifically described. If we observe a cooperation of these proteins in Pol II-dependent transcription, their functional interactions must occur in the nucleoplasm. Nucleoli might represent a site to keep transcription factors unavailable for gene regulatory functions, a hypothesis which may also apply to TIPT2. However, we have preliminary evidence that the nucleolar localization of TIPT2 also reflects a role in the activation of ribosomal RNA by polymerase I. In addition, our unpublished data indicate that TIPT2 nucleolar localization is regulated by phosphorylation.</p><p>Sequences flanking the core TATA box can influence the assembly of complexes, affect the basal level of transcription and the response to activators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>]. Our results show that TIPT2 contacts the AdMLP on a BRE site immediately upstream of the TATA box, without a need for TFIIB or TBP. In band-shift assays TIPT2/AdMLP complexes run in two or more bands (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>, lanes 2,3; 3D, lane 2; 3F, lane2). The faster migrating band represents TIPT2 associated with the BRE<sup>u </sup>site of the oligonucleotide. The slower band(s) could represent more than one TIPT2 protein per oligonucleotide, with only one monomer engaged in DNA interactions. The slower migrating complex becomes more prominent than the faster complex after addition of cold oligonucleotides with BRE<sup>u </sup>mutations (m2, m3, m4; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3F</xref>). This might be indicative of a second DNA binding site on the TIPT2 protein interacting with the competitor.</p><p>The binding of TIPT2 to the BRE site interfered significantly with the binding of TBP to the TATA box. Both proteins on one oligonucleotide providing both binding sites were not clearly demonstratable. But some material of lower electrophoretic mobility may indicate the formation of a triple complex, containing AdMLP, TIPT2 and TBP. This disappeared upon addition of anti-TBP antibodies. ChIP experiments indicated that TBP and TIPT2 could be associated <italic>in vivo </italic>with chromatin in the TATA box containing promoter region of the <italic>GAPDH </italic>gene. While this finding does not formally prove the simultaneous presence, it appears very unlikely that the active GAPDH promoter exists in two different configurations, being occupied with either TBP or TIPT2.</p><p>Our data suggest that transcriptional activation by TIPT2 is optimal in the presence of a BRE<sup>u </sup>element (AdMLP), but occurs also with a mutated (AdMLPm3) BRE<sup>u </sup>element or in its absence (TK promoter). DNA binding of TIPT2 appears not to be essential, and association just by protein-protein contact seems to be sufficient. A recent bioinformatic study revealed that 24.5% of core promoters from the EPD (Eukaryotic Promoter Database: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.epd.isb-sib.ch"/>), and 25.5% from the DBTSS (Database of Transcriptional Start Sites; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dbtss.hgc.jp/index.html"/>), respectively contain a BRE<sup>u </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. More precisely, 28,1% of TATA-less promoters and 11.8% of TATA-containing promoters present a BRE<sup>u</sup>. It is therefore conceivable that TIPT2 plays a role in the activation of transcription from many promoters.</p><p>The TIPT2 binding protein, geminin, activated transcription in several reporter assays. The simultaneous transfection of geminin and TIPT2 expression vectors boosted the activation of TATA-containing promoters. A mutant of TIPT2 that could not interact with geminin was clearly less active, again underlining the importance of the geminin/TIPT2 interaction in transcriptional activation. Our results concerning AdML promoter mutations analysis extends the previous findings that disruption of BRE<sup>u </sup>decreased activated transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>]. Our data indicate that a similar mechanism for transcriptional activation could hold true in the case of the TATA-less NF1 promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>]. Mammalian TBPL1 does not stimulate transcription <italic>in vitro </italic>from TATA box-containing E4, AdML and Hsp70 promoters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>]. We showed here that TIPT2, TBPL1 and NF1 promoter form a complex <italic>in vitro</italic>. The synergistic transcriptional activation of the NF1 promoter by TBPL1, TIPT2 and geminin is similar to the synergistic activation we observed for the TATA box-containing promoters (AdML, TK) by TBP, TIPT2 and geminin. It may, however, be too simplistic to correlate exclusively the TATA box promoters with TBP, and the TATA-less promoters with TBPL1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p><p>Down-regulation of geminin levels in human U2OS cells decreased the activity obtained from activated TK and NF1 promoters, indicating that already the endogenous geminin plays a significant role in our transcriptional assays. Geminin was reported to be involved in different, transcription-related complexes as a negative regulator of transcription, either directly or indirectly. In this study we show geminin's function as transcriptional co-activator. Other studies have shown that another chromatin remodeler, the SWI/SNF complex, is able to act in a gene-dependent manner either as activator or repressor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>]. Our results suggest that geminin may interact with distinct protein complexes that exhibit cell-type or gene-specific functions. These interactions may decide if geminin affects transcription as a transcriptional repressor or activator.</p><p>In agreement with <italic>in vitro </italic>and reporter assay data, the chromatin analysis revealed geminin and TIPT2 on TATA-containing and TATA-less, active gene promoters. On the active endogenous chromatin, TIPT2 and geminin were present near the TATA box of the <italic>GAPDH </italic>gene, but not of the <italic>c-fos </italic>or the <italic>HSP-70 </italic>gene on a distance of two-three nucleosomes. The active TATA-less NF1 promoter is associated with geminin and TIPT2 in the region where TBPL1 was shown to bind. Our own ChIP evidence does not allow to conclude for the presence of TBP in the chromatin of the NF1 promoter in U2OS cells. However, recently the presence of TBP was described in the chromatin of the NF1 promoter in HeLa cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p><p>A genome-wide analysis of TRF2 recognition sites in <italic>Drosophila </italic>indicates that TRF2, a protein closely related to vertebrate TBPL1, plays a more general role than previously thought, being required for the expression of more than 1,000 genes, some involved in regulation of chromatin organization and cell growth (<italic>Histone H1 linker </italic>and ribosomal protein genes) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. This may suggest also that in mammals TBPL1 plays an important role regulating essential cell functions not only in testis, but also in other tissues. In this new perspective, our study might indicate new factors binding to both TBP and TBPL1, which might constitute co-regulatory proteins common for both core promoter corresponding complexes.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, we suggest that the two interacting proteins TIPT2 and geminin function as synergistic transcriptional regulators in contact with both the basal transcriptional machinery and chromatin factors, including members of the Polycomb complex.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Plasmids constructions</title><p>The primers used for this study are listed in Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>.

Antibodies were used for immunoprecipitation of precleared chromatin. The complexes were collected using either protein G or protein A sepharose beads (16&#x02013;201, 16&#x02013;157, Upstate), the beads were washed, and the complexes were eluted. The crosslinking was reversed for 6 hours at 65&#x000b0;C.

A Renilla reporter (pRL-CMV, pRL-SV40, Promega) as internal standard was not included, since it turned out to be variably affected by introduced transcription factors. Each transfection experiment was performed in four parallel wells containing equal numbers of cells. The mean values, standard deviations and p-values were calculated. The p-values were obtained using a paired t-test. In text p-value &#x0003c; 0.01 indicates significant differences, and highly significant differences are presented as p-value &#x0003c; 0,001. The total amount of DNA per well was kept constant at 1425 ng by the addition of CMV-GFP. The reporter-TBP/TBPL1 expression vector ratio was always 10:1.
