P190B Rho GTPase activating protein (RhoGAP) functions as a major inhibitor of the Rho GTPases. P190B is required for mammary gland morphogenesis, and overexpression of p190B in the mammary gland induces hyperplastic lesions. Hence, we hypothesized that p190B may play a pivotal role in mammary tumorigenesis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>To investigate the effects of loss of p190B function on mammary tumor progression, p190B heterozygous mice were crossed with an MMTV-Neu breast cancer model. Effects of p190B deficiency on tumor latency, multiplicity, growth, preneoplastic progression and metastasis were evaluated. To investigate potential differences in tumor angiogenesis between the two groups, immunohistochemistry to detect von Willebrand factor was performed and quantified.

Angiogenesis was decreased in the p190B heterozygous tumors, and expression of a potent angiogenic inhibitor, thrombospondin-1, was elevated in p190B<sup>+/-</sup>Neu mammary glands. Transplantation of p190B<sup>+/-</sup>Neu tumor fragments into wild-type recipients restored tumor angiogenesis.

Rho proteins are molecular switches that cycle between an active GTP-bound state and an inactive GDP-bound state, and their activities are spatially and temporally regulated. Three classes of proteins control Rho activity, including guanine nucleotide exchange factors that activate the switch, GTPase activating proteins (GAPs) that inactivate the switch, and guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors that prevent the exchange of GDP for GTP on the endogenous RhoGTPases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Several studies have shown overexpression of Rho family members in human breast cancer samples by immunohistochemistry, by mutational analysis, or by RNA expression profiling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The role of Rho signaling in breast cancer, however, is not well understood.</p><p>To elucidate the contribution of the Rho signaling pathway to the growth and progression of breast cancer, we focused on understanding the role of p190B RhoGAP, which has been shown previously to play an important role in normal mammary gland development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. P190B is a member of the RhoGAP family, which acts as negative regulator of Rho activity. The GAP domain of p190B demonstrated activity against Rho, Rac and Cdc42 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], and more recently p190B was shown to directly bind Rnd3, Rac1 and RhoA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Homozygous deletion of p190B results in central nervous system and lung defects, leading to perinatal lethality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. P190B-deficient embryos and cells are smaller than their wild-type counterparts, due in part to impaired insulin-like growth factor signaling. Importantly, the p190B and insulin-like growth factor signaling pathways have been shown to directly interact through Rho kinase (ROK) phosphorylation of insulin receptor substrate proteins and to be critically involved in regulating both cell growth and differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>P190B is highly expressed throughout embryonic and virgin mammary gland development, with expression decreasing during late pregnancy and remaining low during lactation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. P190B homozygous-deficient mammary glands fail to undergo ductal morphogenesis. Moreover, loss of one allele of p190B transiently delays ductal morphogenesis and results in decreased proliferation within the terminal end buds, which drive ductal penetration into the fat pad [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Overexpression of p190B during virgin development disrupts terminal end bud morphogenesis, increases side branching, and delays ductal elongation, while overexpression during pregnancy results in hyperplastic lesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>To elucidate the role of p190B in mammary tumor progression, we crossed p190B heterozygous mice with a mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV)-Neu mouse model of breast cancer and examined multiple stages of tumor progression. Neu/ErbB2 is a member of the epidermal growth factor receptor family that is amplified and overexpressed in 20 to 30% of human breast cancers and correlates with poor prognosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Several mouse models have been generated to examine mechanisms involved in ErbB2-mediated mammary tumor progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. For these studies, we chose to use the MMTV-Neu model that overexpresses a wild-type <italic>Neu </italic>proto-oncogene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. MMTV-Neu female mice develop preneoplastic lesions, some of which progress to adenocarcinomas, with a median onset of 7 months of age. Approximately 70 to 80% of tumor-bearing mice develop metastasic disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. GAPs and related G proteins are reportedly upregulated in these tumors, suggesting that Rho signaling is important for MMTV-Neu tumor formation and progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>Using this approach, we demonstrate that p190B plays a critical role in MMTV-Neu-induced tumorigenesis. Strikingly, loss of one allele of p190B decreased tumor penetrance, delayed tumor onset, and reduced metastasis. Furthermore, the progression of preneoplastic lesions was inhibited by the loss of p190B, and p190B heterozygous tumors have a reduced vascular network, thus implicating p190B in tumor angiogenesis. Reciprocal transplantation of tumor fragments confirmed that p190B expression in the stroma plays an important role in tumor angiogenesis. The effects of p190B loss on angiogenesis may be due in part to increased expression of a potent anti-angiogenic factor, thrombospondin-1 (TBS-1). The reduction in angiogenesis may contribute to the inhibition of metastasis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title></sec><sec><title>Mice strains and tumor analysis</title><p>P190B null mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] were backcrossed to FVB for four generations.

Interestingly, the levels of PAK1/2 were elevated in the p190B<sup>+/-</sup>Neu tumors. We also examined the levels of active Rac1, RhoA, and Cdc42. Rac1 was significantly decreased in the heterozygous tumors while RhoA and Cdc42 were unaltered (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2d</xref>). These data show that heterozygosity for p190B does not affect tumor histology or growth, but does affect Rho signaling pathways.</p></sec><sec><title>Haploinsufficiency for p190B blocks preneoplastic progression by reducing angiogenesis</title><p>To determine how p190B haploinsufficiency was inhibiting tumor progression we examined using whole-mount analysis the remaining mammary glands from mice that had developed tumors. These glands exhibited many abnormalities, including enlarged ducts, alveolar-like development, and preneoplastic lesions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref>). The number of preneoplastic lesions in one number 4 inguinal gland from each mouse at the time of sacrifice for tumor burden was quantified.

We therefore considered the possibility that a block in the angiogenic switch may be one potential mechanism by which haploinsufficiency for p190B resulted in an increased number of preneoplastic lesions, but fewer tumors. To examine the gene expression of potential mediators of the angiogenic switch, mRNA isolated from 8-week-old to 12-week-old p190B<sup>+/-</sup>Neu and p190B<sup>+/-</sup>Neu virgin mammary glands was analyzed using an angiogenesis Superarray platform. While few significant changes in expression of these genes were detected, we observed a twofold increase in the mRNA expression of TBS-1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3c</xref> and Additional data file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>), a potent angiogenic inhibitor produced by stromal fibroblasts, endothelial cells and immune cells.

These data further support p190B haploinsufficiency in the vasculature and/or stroma as being responsible for the tumor growth potential.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>In the present article we show that p190B RhoGAP, a gene that is essential for mammary gland development, plays a critical role in MMTV-Neu mammary tumor progression. Haploinsufficiency for p190B increases tumor-free survival, reduces tumor penetrance, and decreases tumor multiplicity. The level of Neu transgene expression is unaltered in the p190B<sup>+/-</sup>Neu normal mammary tissue and tumors, and thus downregulation of transgene expression is not responsible for the inhibition of tumor progression. ErbB3 expression was also similar between the two groups, suggesting that p190B deficiency does not inhibit Neu-induced tumorigenesis by altering the epidermal growth factor receptor signaling axis that promotes tumor formation in this model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Interestingly, p190B heterozygosity does not inhibit the growth rate of established tumors. Furthermore, we found in a few of the p190B<sup>+/-</sup>Neu tumors that p190B expression levels were comparable with the levels detected in the p190B<sup>+/+</sup>Neu tumors (data not shown).</p><p>It has been reported that GAPs and related G proteins are upregulated in MMTV-Neu tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], and our results confirm that this signaling network plays an important role in MMTV-Neu tumor progression. Based on previous studies using p190B-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], we anticipated that reduced p190B expression <italic>in vivo </italic>would increase Rho GTPase activities as well as signaling through the downstream effectors ROK and PAK. GTPase assays to examine the levels of active RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42, however, demonstrated that only Rac1 levels were altered in the heterozygous tumors, and they were in fact decreased. In addition, ROK activity - and in some cases ROK expression levels - were reduced in the p190B-deficient tumors, whereas PAK1/2 activity levels were increased. These data indicate that p190B is required for proper regulation of Rho/ROK signaling during Neu mammary tumor progression.</p><p>Rac1 and PAK activities have been shown to play important roles in mammary tumorigenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], and thus PAK1/2 activities may be elevated in the p190B-deficient mice to compensate for the decrease in Rac1 activity. It is interesting, and perhaps not surprising, that p190B deficiency does not result in persistent upregulation of Rho GTPase activity in the tumors. Rho GTPases play critical roles in essential cellular processes such as cell cycle progression, mitosis, and cell survival, and GTPase activity is tightly controlled during these processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Downstream effectors such as PAK and ROK are also critical for these processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. A loss of p190B resulting in persistently elevated activity of several Rho GTPases is therefore likely to have a negative impact on cell survival or proliferation. Other GAPs or guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors may be upregulated or the guanine nucleotide exchange factor activity may be downregulated to compensate for the loss of p190B. In some tumors, we noted that p190B levels were similar to levels in wild-type tumors, suggesting compensatory mechanisms were functioning to restore p190B levels.</p><p>Taken together, these results demonstrate that p190B deficiency results in unexpected effects on the Rho signaling axis and reveal an important role for p190B in regulating these signaling pathways during mammary tumor progression. In addition, these results highlight the importance of investigating the role of these signaling pathways in tumorigenesis in the context of the complex <italic>in vivo </italic>environment.</p><p>Examination of the mammary glands from the p190B<sup>+/-</sup>Neu tumor-burden mice indicated that there were a higher number of preneoplastic lesions. This increase probably resulted from a lack of progression, since averaging the number of preneoplastic lesions and the number of tumors showed no statistical difference in the total number of initiated lesions between the p190B<sup>+/+</sup>Neu mice and the p190B<sup>+/-</sup>Neu mice. These preneoplastic lesions were characteristic of the avascular phase of the angiogenic switch, as they were approximately 1 to 2 mm in diameter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Interestingly, several p190B<sup>+/-</sup>Neu mice did not develop tumors by 18 months of age and, when their glands were examined for preneoplastic lesions, no lesions were detected (7/7 mice) (data not shown). These data suggest that p190B is important for the progression of preneoplastic lesions, but that it may also play a role in tumor initiation. Further studies in which normal mammary tissue pieces from p190B<sup>+/-</sup>Neu mice are transplanted into wild-type stroma and are allowed to proceed through the stochastic process of tumor formation will be required to examine preneoplastic lesions in more detail.</p><p>The possibility that p190B was important for the progression of avascular preneoplastic lesions to vascularized lesions prompted us to examine angiogenesis in the p190B<sup>+/-</sup>Neu mice. To characterize the potential for a vascular defect in these mice we utilized the Superarray qRT-PCR angiogenesis platform, which allowed us to examine the expression of 87 angiogenesis genes, both positive and negative regulators, including vascular endothelial growth factor, matrix metalloproteinase-2 and matrix metalloproteinase-9, hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha, fibroblast growth factor genes, TBS-1, and transforming growth factor beta genes. Only TBS-1 was significantly increased within the adult virgin mammary glands of the p190B<sup>+/-</sup>Neu mice, and quantification of immunostaining for TBS-1 confirmed this increase.</p><p>Previous studies have demonstrated that TBS-1 is a component of the extracellular matrix that functions as a negative regulator of tumor vasculature, and TBS-1 expression dramatically effects mammary tumorigenesis. For example, overexpression of TBS-1 inhibited angiogenesis in transgenic mice overexpressing activated Neu, resulting in delayed tumor onset and reduced tumor penetrance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Conversely, TBS-1 deficiency in the transgenic mice overexpressing activated Neu increased angiogenesis, enhanced growth, and reduced tumor latency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p><p>TBS-1 has previously been linked to GTPase signaling. Ras/Rho signaling has been shown to repress TBS-1 through effects on phosphatidyl inositol-3 kinase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], and Ras/Rho-mediated suppression of TBS-1 has been suggested as necessary to promote angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Disruption of Rho/ROK signaling may therefore account for the elevated TBS-1 expression that was detected in the p190B<sup>+/-</sup>Neu mice. Increased expression of this potent angiogenic inhibitor may be responsible, in part, for the dramatic inhibition of tumorigenesis that occurred in the p190B<sup>+/-</sup>Neu mice.</p><p>Consistent with the increased TBS-1 expression in p190B<sup>+/-</sup>Neu mammary glands, p190B haploinsufficiency also resulted in decreased angiogenesis in the tumors. This persistent vascular defect may be responsible for the decreased number of metastatic nodules detected in the tumor-bearing p190B heterozygous mice. Interestingly, an increased vascular density has been correlated with poor breast cancer prognosis, and TBS-1 expression was inversely correlated with malignant progression of mammary and lung carcinomas as well as melanoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p><p>Our transplantation experiments showed that the reduction in angiogenesis was probably due to defects in the stroma or vasculature because transplantation of p190B<sup>+/-</sup>Neu tumor pieces into wild-type stroma restored angiogenesis to the levels detected in wild-type tumors. Conversely, wild-type tumors pieces failed to grow in the p190B-deficient stroma, suggesting that loss of p190B. These data are consistent with recent studies in which siRNA knockdown of p190B inhibited capillary tube formation in Matrigel by human umbilical vein endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Interestingly, these transplantation experiments revealed a decreased time to tumor burden in the p190B<sup>+/-</sup>Neu transplant tumors compared with the p190B<sup>+/+</sup>Neu tumors. The mechanism responsible for this difference remains to be elucidated. One potential explanation, however, may be that the cells which initiated the p190B<sup>+/-</sup>Neu tumors had already acquired significant genetic changes in order to develop the initial tumor in the absence of one allele of p190B, which in the presence of wild-type stroma impart a growth advantage. For example, PAK1/2 activity is elevated in the heterozygous tumors, and PAK1 hyperactivation promotes mammary tumor formation in part by activating p38MAPK signaling and proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Elevated PAK activity may therefore allow the tumor cells to respond more robustly to proliferative cues present in the wild-type stroma. Further studies, including microarray analysis of the original and transplanted tumors, as well as transplantation experiments in which p190B<sup>+/-</sup>Neu mammary epithelium is introduced into wild-type stroma and is allowed to go through the stochastic process of tumor formation, will be required to fully understand the contribution of p190B in the epithelium to tumor initiation, growth, and progression.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Elevated expression of Rho GTPases has been detected in many types of cancer including breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. RhoA, RhoB, Rac1/Rac1b, and Cdc42 are overexpressed in breast tumors, with RhoA expression associated with advanced stages of the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. RhoC overexpression has been associated with inflammatory breast cancer and may be involved in tumor angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Our studies demonstrate that p190B, an inhibitor of the Rho GTPases, is required for Rho/ROK signaling during mammary tumorigenesis and point to a critical role for p190B in the vasculature during tumor progression.
