These cells originate during embryonic development in the olfactory placode and migrate into the forebrain, where they become integral members of the hypothalamic&#x02013;pituitary&#x02013;gonadal axis. This migratory process is regulated by a wide range of guidance cues, which allow GnRH-1 cells to travel over long distances to reach their appropriate destinations. The Semaphorin4D (Sema4D) receptor, PlexinB1, is highly expressed in the developing olfactory placode, but its function in this context is still unknown. Here, we demonstrate that PlexinB1-deficient mice exhibit a migratory defect of GnRH-1 neurons, resulting in reduction of this cell population in the adult brain. Moreover, Sema4D promotes directional migration in GnRH-1 cells by coupling PlexinB1 with activation of the Met tyrosine kinase (hepatocyte growth factor receptor). This work identifies a function for PlexinB1 during brain development and provides evidence that Sema4D controls migration of GnRH-1 neurons.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>P.

GnRH-1&#x02013;secreting neurons originate from the nasal placode (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wray, 2002</xref>) during embryonic development and migrate to the hypothalamus apposed to olfactory-vomeronasal nerves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Schwanzel-Fukuda and Pfaff, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wray et al., 1989</xref>). In humans, several monogenic disorders leading to idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadisms (IHH) are caused by disruption of GnRH-1 neuronal ontogeny/migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gonzalez-Martinez et al., 2004</xref>). Unraveling new genetic pathways involved in the regulation of GnRH-1 system development is relevant for understanding the basis of pathogeneses leading to human IHH disorders. However, the full repertoire of molecular cues regulating the migratory process, and the correct targeting of GnRH-1 neurons to the hypothalamus have not been elucidated. The underlying mechanisms are believed to involve different classes of signaling molecules. In recent years, pleiotropic factors have been added to the list of molecules influencing the development of the GnRH-1 neuroendocrine compartment. Among these, hepatocyte growth factor (HGF; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Giacobini et al., 2007</xref>) and secreted-class 3 semaphorins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cariboni et al., 2007</xref>) have been shown to play a role in the control of GnRH-1 migratory process. Semaphorins constitute one of the largest protein families of phylogenetically conserved guidance cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tran et al., 2007</xref>). Although originally identified as embryonic axon guidance cues, secreted and membrane-bound semaphorins are now known to regulate multiple, distinct processes crucial for neuronal network formation, including axon growth, dendritic morphology, and neuronal migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Casazza et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhou et al., 2008</xref>). Accumulating evidence shows that semaphorins can repel or attract a wide range of neuronal and nonneuronal cells depending on the cellular targets and on the expression of different subunits of the receptor complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Giordano et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pasterkamp et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Conrotto et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Swiercz et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>It has been shown that the main transducing semaphorin receptors belong to the plexin family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tran et al., 2007</xref>). Plexins can associate with other membrane receptors, leading to activation of different biological programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Giordano et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Conrotto et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Swiercz et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">2007</xref>). In fact, we have previously shown that Semaphorin4D (Sema4D), other than being a collapsing signal for axonal growth cones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Swiercz et al., 2002</xref>), may also induce chemotaxis of epithelial and endothelial cells, and that it functions as a proangiogenic factor through coupling its receptor PlexinB1 with the Met tyrosine kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Giordano et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Conrotto et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">2005</xref>). Yet, the potential role of Sema4D in regulating neuronal cell migration has not been investigated so far. Moreover, although Sema4D high-affinity receptors, PlexinB1 and PlexinB2, are highly expressed in the developing olfactory structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Perala et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Deng et al., 2007</xref>), their functions in the development of the olfactory and GnRH-1 systems are still unknown.</p><p>Here, we find that Sema4D expression is present along the GnRH-1 migratory route, with a peak of expression in the hypothalamic target area, and that GnRH-1 cells express the Sema4D receptor PlexinB1, but not PlexinB2, in a temporal window associated with their migratory process. Analysis of PlexinB1-deficient mice revealed a migratory defect of GnRH-1 cells, leading to reduced size of this neuronal population in adult brains. Using different experimental approaches, we demonstrated that Sema4D promotes the migratory activity of immortalized GnRH-1 cells through the activation of PlexinB1 and the associated Met receptor.</p><p>Collectively, our data reveal a novel function of Sema4D in the development of GnRH-1 neurons and identify the PlexinB1&#x02013;Met receptor complex as a fundamental asset for neuronal cell migration and guidance.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Sema4D/PlexinB1 expression in the developing nasal regions</title><p>Sema4D is a membrane-bound semaphorin that is also proteolytically released in diffusible form in the extracellular space. To gain further insights into the function of this molecule in the developing GnRH-1&#x02013;olfactory systems, we determined the spatiotemporal expression pattern of Sema4D protein during mouse embryonic development. At embryonic day 12.5 (E12.5), a robust Sema4D immunoreactivity was detectable in the rostral aspect of the developing forebrain (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 a</xref>, see high-magnification view in box 1) and in the basal forebrain (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 a</xref>, see high-magnification view in box 2), which, respectively, represent the intermediate and final targets of GnRH-1 migratory process (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 a</xref>). Sema4D was also found to be expressed in the same regions at E14.5 and E17.5 (unpublished data). Inclusion of a staining control (cntr) confirmed the specificity of the Sema4D staining (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 b</xref>; no primary antibody).</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Sema4D and PlexinB1 are expressed along the GnRH-1 migratory route.</bold> (a) Sema4D immunoreactivity is detected in the nasal mesenchyme (nm), surrounding the OE and VNO epithelia.

Immunohistochemistry for PlexinB1 and GnRH-1 was performed on consecutive sagittal sections of mouse embryos. At E12.5, the PlexinB1 expression pattern paralleled GnRH-1 neuronal distribution in the nasal region (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, c&#x02013;f</xref>). Indeed, GnRH-1&#x02013;expressing cells migrating through the nasal mesenchyme (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 e</xref>) likely coincide with those positive for PlexinB1 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 f</xref>).

PlexinB1 and NCAM expressions overlapped along olfactory axon bundles crossing the nasal mesenchyme at E12.5, as shown by single confocal planes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 i</xref>, inset). Hence, the PlexinB1 receptor demarcated the olfactory system and the migratory GnRH-1 cell population. Because of low signal-to-noise levels in the developing brain, we were unable to detect specific immunoreactivity for PlexinB1 along the vomeronasal caudal nerve that GnRH-1 cells follow into the ventral forebrain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yoshida et al., 1995</xref>) nor in GnRH-1 neurons located in the brain at later developmental stages (E14.5 and E17.5; unpublished data).</p><p>The developmental expression patterns of Sema4D and PlexinB1 are consistent with a role of Sema4D as guidance cue for migratory GnRH-1 cells and/or developing olfactory axons.</p></sec><sec><title>Primary GnRH-1 neurons express PlexinB1 but not PlexinB2 during their migratory process</title><p>It has been previously shown that the migration of GnRH-1 neurons observed in vivo is consistently recapitulated in nasal explants ex vivo (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, a and b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fueshko and Wray, 1994</xref>).

These data indicated that Sema4D stimulation triggers cytoskeletal remodeling that is typical of migratory cells.

Treatment of GN11 cells with 200 nM and 500 nM PHA, respectively, curbed the phosphorylation of Met down to levels comparable to cntr conditions (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 a</xref>). In coculture experiments, many more GN11 cells migrated out of the aggregate in the presence of a source of Sema4D, as compared with mock treatment (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7, b and c</xref>). Moreover, asymmetrical directional migration of GN11 cells pointed to a chemoattractive activity of Sema4D (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7, b and c</xref>). Such an attractive effect was prevented when the Met inhibitor PHA was applied to the culture medium (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7, b and c</xref>). These results were further confirmed by blocking Met activation with RNA interference technology. GN11 cells were infected with a lentiviral construct expressing both a Met-specific short hairpin RNA (shRNA) sequence (shRNA Met; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pennacchietti et al., 2003</xref>) and the marker GFP, under control of a separate promoter. As a specificity control, we used a construct expressing a mismatched Met shRNA sequence (shRNA cntr). Infection efficiency was confirmed by visualization of GFP expression under a fluorescent microscope (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8, a and b</xref>), and Met silencing was verified by Western blot analysis (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 c</xref>).

We found that the Sema4D receptor, PlexinB1, is expressed in migratory GnRH-1 cells exiting the olfactory neuroepithelium. These data were confirmed by single-cell RT-PCR analysis on primary GnRH-1 neurons isolated from nasal explants. PlexinB1 expression correlated with the migratory stage of these cells, being higher at 3 and 4.5 div and down-regulated in postmigratory GnRH-1 neurons (10 and 28 div). Recent work has shown a key requirement for PlexinB2 but not PlexinB1 in the patterning of the vertebrate nervous system in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Deng et al., 2007</xref>). Our single-cell RT-PCR data provide evidence that GnRH-1 cells do not express PlexinB2 at any developmental stage analyzed, thus excluding a possible direct involvement of this receptor in the cellular response mediated by Sema4D. We further showed that Sema4D binds the developing VNO/OE epithelia, and that PlexinB1&#x02013;Sema4D binding is much stronger than PlexinB2&#x02013;Sema4D in these regions.

The development and organization of the olfactory axonal scaffold in PlexinB1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice did not show abnormalities, which suggests that the migratory defect might be cell autonomous rather than dependent on alterations of the olfactory axonal pathway. In brains of adult mutant animals, the population of GnRH-1 cells was significantly reduced, by approximately one third compared with PlexinB1<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> littermates. Consistently, the median eminence of these mice also appeared less innervated by GnRH-1 fibers as compared with WT. Our single-cell RT-PCR data revealed that GnRH-1 neurons differ in their PlexinB1 expression as a function of age. This might explain why only a fraction of neurons are affected by the lack of PlexinB1 gene. It is important to emphasize that a high degree of heterogeneity within the GnRH-1 neuron population has been documented extensively during the last years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Herbison et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schwarting et al., 2007</xref>). This seems to warrant the fact that no single genetic mutation may totally prevent these neurons from reaching their final destinations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schwarting et al., 2007</xref>). Therefore, it is likely that failure of puberty in mammals may only occur when the majority of GnRH-1 neurons are affected by multigenic mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Herbison et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kim et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>It is possible that in PlexinB1 mutant animals, the GnRH-1 cells that do not reach the final target areas at the right time may be eliminated by cell death. However, because of the small size of the GnRH-1 neuronal population and the limited temporal window during which apoptosis takes place, it was not possible to determine if this was the case. In other mutant mice, such as neuropilin 2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>, netrin1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>, and ephrin3&#x02013;5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, there also were reported losses in immunoreactive GnRH-1 neuron numbers, but it was not feasible to determine the cause (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schwarting et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gamble et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cariboni et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>In our study, we have also analyzed whether mice deficient for Sema4D would display a GnRH-1 phenotype similar to that seen in PlexinB1 KO mice. Sema4D-null mice do not show gross abnormalities in other tissues other than the immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shi et al., 2000</xref>). Our quantitative analysis of the total number of GnRH-1 cells in adult brains revealed no differences in the size of this neuronal population between WT and mutant mice (WT: 654 &#x000b1; 16.5, <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 4; Sema4D<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>: 660 &#x000b1; 24, <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 3; <italic>t</italic> test, P &#x0003d; 0.8), which suggests that the absence of this semaphorin could be compensated by alternative, as yet unidentified, ligands for PlexinB1, or by the potentiation of other synergistic morphogenetic signals such as netrins, SDF-1, and HGF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Schwarting et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Giacobini et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Sema4D-induced signaling pathways can use different mechanisms to elicit either repulsion/inhibition of cell motility or promigratory/chemoattractive responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhou et al., 2008</xref>). In PC12 cells, Sema4D activation of PlexinB1 suppresses cell migration through inhibition of R-Ras and, subsequently, of &#x003b2;1-integrin activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Oinuma et al., 2006</xref>). In other cellular systems, Sema4D effects seem to be gated through the association of the receptor PlexinB1 with tyrosine kinases such as Met, Ron, and ErbB2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Giordano et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Conrotto et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Swiercz et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Conrotto et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Swiercz et al., 2007</xref>). Our data demonstrate for the first time in neurons a structural and functional association of PlexinB1 and Met receptors (holoreceptor complex) in GN11 cells. Moreover, Sema4D stimulation increases the holoreceptor complex formation. We observed a bell-shaped curve of Met tyrosine kinase activation in response to increasing concentrations of Sema4D, which parallels the bell-shaped curve of Sema4D-stimulated cell motility. One possible explanation for this observation is that Sema4D may be released by cells in monomeric and homodimeric forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Elhabazi et al., 2001</xref>), this last being generally preferred when the semaphorin is present at high concentrations. It is not known which is the relative ability of the two forms in stimulating the formation of PlexinB1&#x02013;Met complexes, but it is conceivable that their relative amount can modulate PlexinB1 homo- or heterodimerization.</p><p>We recently showed that HGF is expressed in the nasal compartment at early stages of development and that it promotes the migration of Met-expressing immortalized and primary GnRH-1 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Giacobini et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">2007</xref>). Notably, HGF expression pattern in the nasal region of mouse embryos parallels that of Sema4D. In this paper, we identified an additive effect of HGF and Sema4D for Met activation and a consequent increase in cell motility as compared with the single ligands stimulations. These results suggest that HGF and Sema4D, in vivo, might act in a combinatorial manner to allow a fine spatial tuning of GnRH-1 migration.</p><p>Finally, we demonstrated the requirement for Met in Sema4D-induced directional migration on GN11 cells by three-dimensional coculture experiments in the presence of a Met-specific kinase inhibitor and by chemotaxis assays in which we interfered with Met expression through RNA interference technology.</p><p>It has now become clear that GnRH-1 migratory process is not only dependent on the expression of specific receptors in these neurons but also on their ability to process guidance information provided by their surroundings. Our results shed light on a novel function for Sema4D as a long-range guidance cue in the GnRH-1 neuronal migration and identify PlexinB1&#x02013;Met interaction as an essential requirement for Sema4D promigratory effect in this system. These data advance our understanding on the molecular mechanisms controlling the development of GnRH-1 system and may represent an important asset to elucidate the etiology of numerous forms of IHH.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>Experiments were conducted in accordance with current European Union and Italian law, under authorization of the Italian Ministry of Health, No. 66/99-A.
