KChIP1 is targeted, through N-terminal myristoylation, to intracellular vesicles that appear to be trafficking intermediates from the ER (endoplasmic reticulum) to the Golgi but differ from those underlying conventional ER&#x02013;Golgi traffic. To define KChIP1 vesicles and the traffic pathway followed by Kv4/KChIP1 traffic, we examined their relationship to potential SNARE (soluble <italic>N</italic>-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein-attachment protein receptor) proteins mediating the trafficking step. To distinguish Kv4/KChIP1 from conventional constitutive traffic, we compared it to the traffic of the VSVG (vesicular-stomatitis virus G-protein). Expression of KChIP with single or triple EF hand mutations quantitatively inhibited Kv4/KChIP1 traffic to the cell surface but had no effect on VSVG traffic. KChIP1-expressing vesicles co-localized with the SNARE proteins Vti1a and VAMP7 (vesicle-associated membrane protein 7), but not with the components of two other ER&#x02013;Golgi SNARE complexes. siRNA (small interfering RNA)-mediated knockdown of Vti1a or VAMP7 inhibited Kv4/KChIP1traffic to the plasma membrane in HeLa and Neuro2A cells. Vti1a and VAMP7 siRNA had no effect on VSVG traffic or that of Kv4.2 when stimulated by KChIP2, a KChIP with different intrinsic membrane targeting compared with KChIP1. The present results suggest that a SNARE complex containing VAMP7 and Vti1a defines a novel traffic pathway to the cell surface in both neuronal and non-neuronal cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="kwd"><kwd>calcium-binding protein</kwd><kwd>K<sup>+</sup> channel-interacting protein (KChIP)</kwd><kwd>potassium channel</kwd><kwd>neuronal calcium sensor (NCS) protein</kwd><kwd>soluble <italic>N</italic>-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion proteinattachment protein receptor (SNARE)</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="abbr"><kwd>ARF, ADP-ribosylation factor</kwd><kwd>DMEM, Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium</kwd><kwd>ECFP, enhanced cyan fluorescent protein</kwd><kwd>ER, endoplasmic reticulum</kwd><kwd>ERGIC, ER&#x02013;Golgi intermediate compartment</kwd><kwd>EYFP, enhanced yellow fluorescent protein</kwd><kwd>FBS, foetal bovine serum</kwd><kwd>GAP, GTPase-activating protein</kwd><kwd>GFP, green fluorescent protein</kwd><kwd>KChIP, K<sup>+</sup> channel-interacting protein</kwd><kwd>LAMP, lysosomal-associated protein</kwd><kwd>PCTV, pre-chylomicron transport vesicle</kwd><kwd>siRNA, small interfering RNA</kwd><kwd>SNARE, soluble <italic>N</italic>-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein-attachment protein receptor</kwd><kwd>TBC1D20, TBC (Tre-2/Bub2/Cdc16) domain family, member 20</kwd><kwd>TRITC, tetramethylrhodamine &#x003b2;-isothiocyanate</kwd><kwd>VAMP, vesicle-associated membrane protein</kwd><kwd>VSVG, vesicular-stomatitis virus G-protein</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="8"/><ref-count count="50"/><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Kv4 potassium channels were first identified as homologues of the <italic>Drosophila Shal</italic> channels and are now known to have key roles in the regulation of the excitability of neurons and cardiac myocytes. In mammals, four members of the Kv4 family (Kv4.1, 4.2, 4.3 short and 4.3 long) are known [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] and they are highly expressed in the brain and heart [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Kv4 potassium channels are responsible for the transient outward A-type current in neurons, and its equivalent in myocytes. In the brain, it is thought that this current is responsible for attenuating back-propagating action potentials and excitatory post-synaptic potentials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The channels also limit action potentials to individual dendritic compartments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] and abnormalities in Kv4 channel function have been implicated in the hyperexcitability underlying epilepsy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>When Kv4 channels are expressed alone in non-neuronal cells, their properties differ from those seen with native channels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. A search for interacting partners that could reconstitute native functions led to the discovery of the KChIPs (K<sup>+</sup> channel-interacting proteins) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], which are members of the NCS (neuronal calcium sensor) family of proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The KChIPs have four EF-hand domains, of which three can potentially bind Ca<sup>2+</sup> and two were seen to be occupied by Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the crystal structure of KChIP1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Of the four KChIPs, only KChIP1 has an N-terminal myristoyl group that is required for it to bind to membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and, uniquely, allows its targeting to a distinct population of intracellular 50&#x02013;100&#x000a0;nm diameter vesicles (referred from now onwards as KChIP1 vesicles) that partially overlap with markers of the ERGIC [ER (endoplasmic reticulum)&#x02013;Golgi intermediate compartment] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The KChIPs have two effects on Kv4 channels. Firstly, the KChIPs modulate the properties of the channel, particularly its inactivation kinetics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Secondly, they increase current density by promoting the traffic of the Kv4 channel to the plasma membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Kv4 proteins alone are able to exit from the ER, but then become trapped in the Golgi complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Co-expression of Kv4 channels with KChIPs leads to their traffic and co-localization at the plasma membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], where the KChIPs are constitutive channel subunits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>The conventional exocytic pathway from the ER has been studied in detail by following the traffic of a temperature-sensitive mutant of the VSVG (vesicular-stomatitis virus G-protein) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Traffic of VSVG from the ER involves budding of COPII-coated vesicles controlled by the GTPase Sar1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and requires Rab1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The vesicle then passes through the intermediate compartment, the ERGIC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] and through the Golgi complex in a COPI-dependent manner before trafficking to the plasma membrane. There is growing evidence in the literature that this single pathway is not responsible for all traffic from the ER to the Golgi. In yeast, there is evidence that both COPII- and COPI-coated vesicles can bud from the ER [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Proteins bound to the membrane via a GPI (glycosylphosphatidylinositol) anchor are found in vesicles distinct from those carrying standard marker proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In mammalian cells, procollagen is too large to fit into the 60&#x02013;80&#x000a0;nm diameter COPII vesicles. Although procollagen appears to require COPII for exit from the ER, it is not found in COPII-coated vesicles, and has no requirement for COPI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Also, several proteins known to affect the transport of the marker VSVG do not affect procollagen transport and vice versa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. In the intestine, distinct triacylglycerol transport vesicles, PCTVs (pre-chylomicron transport vesicles) can bud from the ER in a COPII-independent manner, and are lacking in COPI, but need COPII later in the pathway to fuse with the Golgi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Rab1-independent traffic from the ER has been suggested to occur for some cargos in non-neuronal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] and neuronal cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. It has been shown that the traffic of Kv4 channels, with associated KChIP1, also occurs by an alternate pathway that is COPII-independent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. KChIP1 vesicles seem to be key intermediates in ER to Golgi traffic but the nature of this pathway and the KChIP1 vesicles involved in traffic are unknown.</p><p>Membrane traffic steps can be defined by the nature of the SNARE (soluble <italic>N</italic>-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein-attachment protein receptor) complex that underlies the fusion of vesicles with their target membrane. SNAREs have been defined as Q or R SNAREs and, based on sequence classification of SNARE subfamilies, active complexes appear to have the composition QaQbQcR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Three such complexes have been implicated in ER to Golgi traffic. From analysis of VSVG traffic, the SNARE complex for the step between ER and the ERGIC consists of Sec22b, membrin, rBet1 and syntaxin 5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. The complex of GOS28, Ykt6, rBet1 and syntaxin 5 is thought to be involved in the fusion of intermediates with the <italic>cis</italic>-Golgi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Finally, a third complex, comprising VAMP7 (vesicle-associated membrane protein 7), Vti1a, rBet1 and syntaxin 5, has been identified in the alternative ER to Golgi trafficking pathway for PCTVs in intestinal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. The general significance of this latter complex in cargo traffic is unknown. We aimed to further characterize the nature of the KChIP1 vesicles and the traffic route taken by Kv4/KChIP1. The results show that the KChIP1 vesicles and Kv4/KChIP1 traffic are distinguished by a VAMP7/Vti1a-containing SNARE complex.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><sec><title>Cell culture and transfection</title><p>HeLa human cervical carcinoma cells were grown in DMEM (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium; Gibco) with 5% FBS (foetal bovine serum; Gibco), 1% non-essential amino acids (Gibco), and 1% penicillin-streptomycin (10000&#x000a0;units/ml penicillin and 10000&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml streptomycin; Gibco) and kept at 37&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C in a 5% CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere.

These conclusions were confirmed by quantification of the level of trafficking of proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1</xref>M and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>N) in assays in which fluorescence in peripheral regions of interest were determined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and normalized in comparison with control cells to provide a value for relative traffic to the plasma membrane for each experiment. The KChIP1 EF hand mutations appeared, therefore, to specifically impair the traffic of Kv4.2/KChIP1.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Effects of KChIP1 and KChIP1 with EF hand mutations on traffic of Kv4.2 and VSVG to the plasma membrane</title><p>HeLa cells were transfected to co-express Kv4.2 and EYFP&#x02013;Golgi (<bold>A</bold>&#x02013;<bold>C</bold>) or ARF1&#x02013;EYFP (<bold>D</bold>&#x02013;<bold>F</bold>) or with wild-type KChIP1-EYFP (<bold>G</bold>), with the single EF hand mutant KChIP1EF3-EYFP (<bold>H</bold>) or with the triple EF-hand mutant KCHIP1EF2&#x02013;4-EYFP (<bold>I</bold>) and Kv4.2 localization was determined by using anti-Kv4.2 immunostaining.

This pathway appears to exist in both non-neuronal (HeLa) and neuronal-derived (Neuro2A) cell lines. Where in the secretory pathway are the KChIP1 vesicles placed? KChIP1 is associated with 50&#x02013;100&#x000a0;nm vesicles, and we have previously concluded that the KChIP1 vesicles are an intermediate in ER to Golgi traffic based on their partial co-localization with ERGIC-53 and the finding that an expressed N-terminal fragment of KChIP1 blocked Kv4.2 traffic and became fully co-localized with an enlarged ERGIC compartment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. They were not COPII-coated nor was COPII function crucial for Kv4.2/KChIP1 traffic, although COPI function was [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. This pathway is likely to be distinct from the other non-conventional ER to Golgi route, such as the well studied route for procollagen, as this is COPII-dependent and COPI-independent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. We now show that the VAMP-7-positive KChIP1 vesicles do not overlap with endosomal or lysosomal markers, consistent with the interpretation that they lie in the early exocytic pathway and with previous results suggesting a role for VAMP/Vti1a in ER to Golgi traffic of PCTVs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].</p><p>VAMP7, which is otherwise known as TI-VAMP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>], appears to be involved in multiple SNARE complexes in various traffic steps in different cell types. It has been shown to be involved in endosomal/lysosomal traffic where it can function in at least two distinct SNARE complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Despite a focus on VAMP7 in endosomal traffic, VAMP7 is also involved in transport of apical vesicles to the plasma membrane in epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. In addition, it is clear that many of the vesicular VAMP7 structures identified by immunofluorescence do not overlap with endosomal/lysosomal markers. In PC12 cells, VAMP7 overlaps to only a low extent with endosomal and lysosomal markers, and it was noted that in HeLa cells the endogenous VAMP7 does not co-localize with the lysosomal protein LAMP1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. We have now confirmed the latter observation in the present study. These findings suggest that VAMP7 may associate with a variety of other SNARE partners to function in multiple membrane traffic steps which may in part be cell type-specific [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. It is noteworthy and potentially relevant to the current study that, in neurons, VAMP7 is involved in axonal and dendritic outgrowth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>] and is associated with as yet unidentified vesicular structures present in axons and dendrites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. In PC12 cells, the VAMP7-labelled vesicles seen by immuno-EM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>] are very similar in size and morphology to those labelled by KChIP1 in HeLa cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>The specificity of siRNA on Kv4.2/KChIP1 traffic and lack of general disruption of the secretory pathway was demonstrated by the lack of effect on VSVG traffic to the plasma membrane. In addition, Vti1a and VAMP7 siRNAs had no effect on Kv4.2 traffic stimulated by KChIP2. This latter result is not surprising given the differing intrinsic localization of KChIP2 compared with KChIP1. Since KChIP2 effectively targets to the plasma membrane due to its palmitoylation even in the absence of Kv4.2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], it would be unlikely to encounter Kv4.2 in the same compartment as KChIP1, but may do so at the level of the Golgi where Kv4.2 accumulates when expressed alone and where many palmitoyltransferases are located [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Interestingly, KChIP2 is expressed at the highest level in the heart [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>] where it is the major KChIP and is indispensable for normal Kv4 function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>] and VAMP7 is apparently not expressed in the heart [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>].</p><p>SNARE complexes suggested to mediate ER to Golgi traffic all contain syntaxin 5 and rBet1, but three distinct complexes have been indentified based on the identity of the other two SNAREs. KChIP1/Kv4.2 traffic appears to involve Vti1a and VAMP7 based on co-localization and functional siRNA data. Vti1a has been shown to interact with syntaxin 5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>], and both Vti1a and VAMP7 have been found to be quantitatively recovered in a SNARE complex with syntaxin 5 and rBet1, which was implicated in ER to Golgi traffic of PCTVs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Since these organelles are expressed in a tissue-specific manner, it was possible that the Vti1a/VAMP7-dependent ER to Golgi traffic could have been an enterocyte-specific process. The present results further highlight the distinctive nature of Kv4.2/KChIP1 traffic and now suggest that Vti1a/VAMP7 define a non-conventional pathway that may be used for the traffic of a range of cargo proteins in neuronal and non-neuronal cell types.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are grateful to Francis Barr, Burcu Hasdemir, Jesse Hay, Thierry Galli and John Presley for the gift of reagents.</p></ack><sec sec-type="funding"><title>FUNDING</title><p>This work was supported by a Wellcome Trust Prize Studentship to S.
