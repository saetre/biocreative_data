Iron deficiency anemia is also a significant health burden resulting from both nutritional deficit as well as parasitic infection in these countries. In this study we investigated the relationships between the disease outcomes of <italic>Schistosoma japonicum</italic> infection and iron homeostasis. We aimed to determine if host iron status has an effect on schistosome maturation or egg production, and to investigate the response of iron regulatory genes to chronic schistosomiasis infection. Wild-type C57BL/6 and <italic>Transferrin Receptor 2</italic> null mice were infected with <italic>S. japonicum</italic>, and sacrificed at the onset of chronic disease. <italic>Transferrin Receptor 2</italic> null mice are a model of type 3 hereditary hemochromatosis and develop significant iron overload providing increased iron stores at the onset of infection. The infectivity of schistosomes and egg production was assessed along with the subsequent development of granulomas and fibrosis. The response of the iron regulatory gene <italic>Hepcidin</italic> to infection and the changes in iron status were assessed by real-time PCR and Western blotting. Our results show that <italic>Hepcidin</italic> levels responded to the changing iron status of the animals, but were not significantly influenced by the inflammatory response. We also show that with increased iron availability at the time of infection there was greater development of fibrosis around granulomas. In conclusion, our studies indicate that chronic inflammation may not be the primary cause of the anemia seen in schistosomiasis, and suggest that increased availability of iron, such as through iron supplementation, may actually lead to increased disease severity.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="7"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Schistosomiasis is a significant parasitic infection creating considerable disease burden in many tropical and developing nations. Currently, some 74 countries are endemic for schistosomiasis with an estimated 600 million people residing within regions in which the parasite is prevalent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009594-Steinmann1">&#x0005b;for review see 1&#x0005d;</xref>. Globally, approximately 207 million people are infected with schistosomes and 120 million of these suffer chronic symptoms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009594-Steinmann2">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Iron deficiency anemia is a significant health burden resulting from both nutritional deficit as well as parasitic infection in many of these schistosomiasis-endemic nations. Chronic schistosomiasis has been associated with the burden of anemia in these developing regions for many years, although it has proven difficult to isolate and substantiate the association owing to the number of confounding factors that exist within these regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009594-Friedman1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009594-King1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Schistosomiasis in humans is caused primarily by 3 species, <italic>Schistosoma mansoni</italic>, <italic>S. japonicum</italic> and <italic>S. haematobium</italic>, which have different geographic distributions throughout Africa, South America and Asia. Despite differences in disease arising from the site of patent infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009594-Ross1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, and subtle differences in immunological responsiveness <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009594-Burke1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009594-Pearce1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, the host disease progression of schistosomiasis is essentially similar for all species. This similarity occurs because disease pathology does not result from infection <italic>per se</italic>, but rather from the intense granulomatous response to antigens secreted by the larvae within the schistosome eggs that have become lodged within host tissue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009594-Burke1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009594-Pearce1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. As the granulomatous response advances, activated hepatic stellate cells and alternatively activated macrophages are believed to be responsible for the deposition of extracellular matrix resulting in hepatic fibrosis surrounding the granulomas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009594-Bartley1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009594-Stavitsky1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. This fibrosis can lead to chronic obstruction of the vasculature, and in humans result in periportal fibrosis, which is responsible for severe long term disease outcomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009594-Ross1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Despite having developed a significant understanding of the pathological development of the schistosomiasis disease state, and its association with anemia being reported anecdotally for decades, it is only in recent years that the association of schistosomiasis and anemia has been definitively linked.</p><p>Several recent cross-sectional multi-variant population cohort studies have confirmed the association of anemia and the disease state of schistosomiasis. These studies have shown that when confounding factors such as nutritional deficiencies, co-infection of other parasites, age, sex, and weight are accounted for, schistosomiasis infection correlates inversely with hemoglobin levels, and can be significantly linked to the associated anemia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009594-Friedman1">&#x0005b;for a review of the association of schistosomiasis and anemia see 3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009594-King1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. The strongest causal relationship between schistosomiasis and anemia has been established for <italic>S. japonicum</italic> from the Philippines, for which several studies have demonstrated an inverse relationship between infection intensity and hemoglobin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009594-Ezeamama1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009594-Kanzaria1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Along with the confirmed linkage of anemia to schistosomiasis have come a number of theories about its cause, though little direct evidence exists to support the anecdotal explanations which exist within the literature. Most commonly, three potential causes are offered including extra-corporeal blood loss, splenic sequestration of iron, and anemia of inflammation (AI) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009594-Friedman1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009594-King1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>AI has become the most commonly theorized cause of the anemia following a number of studies that have shown that increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, in particular IL-6, are produced during chronic schistosomiasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009594-Leenstra1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009594-Coutinho2">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. At significant levels, the pro-inflammatory cytokines which are produced as part of the inflammatory response, such as IL-6 and TNF-&#x003b1;, can lead to AI <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009594-Kemna1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009594-Theurl1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. It is of note though, that the association between pro-inflammatory cytokines and infection only occurs at the most intense levels of infection and hepatic fibrosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009594-Leenstra1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009594-Coutinho2">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. In spite of the fact that AI is often put forward as either the cause or as the major contributing factor toward the anemia, no research has investigated the response of the iron homeostatic and regulatory pathways to patent or chronic schistosomiasis. Thus it remains uncertain whether the level of pro-inflammatory cytokines associated with infection are sufficient to &#x02018;override&#x02019; the influence of the homeostatic drive on the regulation of the iron homeostasis genes.</p><p>The central regulator of iron homeostasis is hepcidin, a 25 amino acid peptide expressed and secreted by hepatocytes. Hepcidin is up-regulated in mammals by iron overload and is suppressed by iron deficiency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009594-Nemeth1">&#x0005b;for review see 19&#x0005d;</xref>. In iron deficient states, hepcidin transcription is down-regulated resulting in increased iron absorption by duodenal enterocytes and the release of iron stores from hepatocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009594-Nemeth1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. The transcription of hepcidin can also be influenced by inflammation induced by microbial pathogens and chemical stimulants, a response which forms part of an innate strategy of the host to combat infection by reducing the bioavailability of iron to the pathogens. In this instance, hepcidin is up-regulated and results in reduced iron absorption by the gut and sequestration of iron into storage in the liver and macrophages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009594-Kemna1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009594-Theurl1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009594-Ganz1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. This has been shown in malaria patients in whom slight increases in hepcidin levels lead to marked impairment of iron incorporation into hemoglobin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009594-deMast1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. Unlike humans who express only a single hepcidin gene, mice express two isoforms of hepcidin, <italic>Hepcidin 1 (Hamp1) and Hepcidin 2 (Hamp2)</italic>. While the individual role of hepcidin 2 has not yet been confirmed, hepcidin 1 has been shown to function as the primary iron regulatory molecule. Since anemia in schistosomiasis is attributed primarily to AI, and a key mediator of AI is hepcidin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009594-Ganz1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, we undertook a detailed study of hepcidin and iron regulation in experimental schistosomiasis to determine whether anemia could be attributable solely to AI and to examine the effect of schistosomiasis on the role of iron regulatory molecules.</p><p>Hereditary hemochromatosis is a genetically heterogeneous group of iron overload disorders caused by mutations in molecules involved in the regulation of iron homeostasis. Mutations in the gene encoding hepcidin (<italic>HAMP</italic>) or upstream regulators of hepcidin such as hemojuvelin (<italic>HJV</italic>), <italic>HFE</italic> and transferrin receptor 2 (<italic>TFR2</italic>) lead to low levels of circulating hepcidin in relation to iron stores and consequent iron loading <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009594-Wallace1">&#x0005b;for review see 22&#x0005d;</xref>. Knockout and transgenic mice have been developed that confirm the importance of these molecules in iron homeostasis and hepcidin regulation. These knockout mice represent animal models of dysfunctional iron regulation. We have previously generated <italic>Transferrin Receptor 2</italic> null mice (<italic>Tfr2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic>), a model of type 3 hereditary hemochromatosis and shown that they have dysregulation of hepcidin resulting in iron overload <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009594-Wallace2">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. Detailed analysis of the effects of <italic>Tfr2</italic> dysfunction on iron homeostasis demonstrate increased iron absorption within the gut along with increased expression of iron transport genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009594-Drake1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In this study we investigated the relationship between the disease outcomes of <italic>S. japonicum</italic> infection, iron status and regulation.

The response of the iron regulatory gene <italic>Hepcidin</italic> to infection and the changes in iron status was assessed within the mice. We show that <italic>Hepcidin</italic> responds to the changing iron status of the animals but is not significantly influenced by the inflammatory response. We also show that with increased iron levels in the host pre-infection there was greater development of fibrosis around granulomas. Our studies indicate that chronic inflammation may not be the primary cause of the anemia seen in schistosomiasis. Further we demonstrate that increased iron at the onset of infection leads to increased liver fibrosis resulting in a more severe long term outcome.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Iron Status with Infection</title><p>At the time of parasite perfusion, hepatic iron stores were estimated by quantification of Perls' Prussian Blue staining for non-heme iron within liver sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0009594-g001">figure 1A and B</xref>).

This reduction in iron status reflects the phenotype seen in human patients, a disease outcome most commonly attributed to AI. In general, AI results from two processes induced in response to inflammation: first, iron may be sequestered within tissues reducing its availability within the body, and second, iron absorption by gut enterocytes is blocked thereby eliminating the dietary source of iron <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009594-Weiss1">&#x0005b;reviewed in 28&#x0005d;</xref>. In the model used in this study (10 week old C57BL/6 mice) infected mice were studied 6 weeks post-infection, approximately 1&#x02013;2 weeks after the onset of parasite egg laying, their entrapment in the liver and the induction of host granulomatous response. The intense inflammatory response directed against eggs might be expected to lead to AI, typified by an inhibition of iron absorption through the up-regulation of hepcidin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009594-Burke1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. <italic>Schistosoma japonicum</italic> infection in these mice, however, led to down-regulation of hepcidin (as measured by expression levels of <italic>Hamp1 and 2</italic>). Decreased hepcidin expression results in increased iron absorption, the opposite of what is required for inflammation to result in AI <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009594-Ganz1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, it is unlikely in this murine infection that decreased iron absorption induced by AI contributed significantly to the reduced iron status of the infected animals. Moreover, liver iron stores were decreased in these schistosomiasis-infected mice, whereas in other infections liver iron stores are increased in AI <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009594-Weiss1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus iron sequestration by normal pathways can be excluded as a cause of AI in schistosomiasis. It is therefore unlikely that AI is the primary cause of the reduced iron status associated with the schistosomiasis infection.</p><p>Friis and co-workers investigated the use of macro-nutrient supplements in treatment of Kenyan school children suffering chronic <italic>S. mansoni</italic> infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009594-Friis1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. Their study found macro-nutrient supplementation improved hemoglobin levels to the same level observed with treatment with the anti-schistosome drug praziquantel. Both macro-nutrient supplementation alone and praziquantel treatment alone resulted in significantly higher hemoglobin levels than for subjects given placebo, bringing hemoglobin levels of treated individuals into the normal range (13&#x02013;18 mg/dL). Our studies, which show decreased hepcidin expression, with likely increase in absorption of dietary iron, provides experimental evidence in support of Friis and colleagues. In the situation of AI however the opposite occurs, hepcidin is up-regulated decreasing the ability of the gut to absorb iron from the diet. In the presence of AI, macro-nutrient supplementation should not be effective at increasing hemoglobin levels.</p><p>Within the schistosomiasis literature the presence of anemia is often attributed to AI because of the failure of occult blood loss to account for the anemia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009594-Kanzaria1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, and the detectable levels of inflammatory markers. Leensta <italic>et al</italic> suggested that AI is likely to be a significant contributor to the anemia seen in schistosomiasis following their findings that anemia was commonly present in the absence of iron deficiency (ID) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009594-Leenstra1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009594-Leenstra2">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. However, in their study the absence or presence of ID was assigned to subjects on the basis of their serum ferritin (SF) levels. A literature review conducted by WHO in 2007 reported that the use of SF levels in the presence of inflammation is likely to result in significant misclassification of ID subjects as iron replete <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009594-WHO1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. WHO now recommends that SF is not a useful indicator of ID when inflammation is present <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009594-WHO1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, it is possible that in the study of Leensta <italic>et al</italic>, subjects with anemia who were classified as iron replete based on their SF may have actually been ID.</p><p>In another cohort study, Cherian and co-workers investigated the relationship of hepcidin and iron status in refugee children <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009594-Cherian1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. They demonstrated that hepcidin levels among children with ID correlated with the iron status, and not the infection or inflammatory status of the child. Furthermore, in this study ID was defined on the basis of &#x02265;2 abnormal age-corrected iron parameters, assisting in better identification of ID in the presence of infection and inflammation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009594-Cherian1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. These findings support our results which show that hepcidin, the master regulator of iron homeostasis and the key regulatory gene responsible for AI is not affected by the levels of infection and inflammation seen in these studies.</p><p><italic>Tfr2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice have a greater amount of bioavailable iron for invading schistosomes than wild-type mice at the time of infection. While we did not measure iron absorption and thus iron availability directly during infection in our study, previous studies on <italic>Tfr2</italic> dysfunction in mice have demonstrated increased iron absorption through the gut along with increased expression of iron transport genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009594-Drake1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. Further to this we have demonstrated decreased <italic>Hepcidin</italic> expression concurrent with <italic>S.japonicum</italic> infection. It is therefore likely that elevated dietary iron absorption occurs concurrently with infection, providing ongoing increased iron availability within the <italic>Tfr2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> host animals. Despite the high requirements of invading schistosomules for host iron, and an expectation that the greater availability of iron in <italic>Tfr2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice might lead to higher burdens in those mice, there were no differences in adult worm numbers between wild-type and <italic>Tfr2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice. The progression toward iron depletion in schistosomiasis may be initiated with the onset of egg-laying, which occurs approximately 4 weeks post infection for <italic>S. japonicum</italic>, resulting in transfer of iron from the host into the eggs. If on-going iron availability is a rate-limiting factor in the progression toward some aspect of chronic disease, then the level of a host's pre-infection iron stores may contribute to the rate of onset of severe symptoms, i.e. the larger the available iron pool, the faster the onset of chronic symptoms. In the same manner, iron supplementation to resolve the anemia associated with schistosomiasis may actually increase the development of long term pathology by providing on-going increased iron availability.</p><p>Ironically the anemia associated with schistosomiasis may actually provide a degree of protection for hosts against the more severe long term pathological consequences of chronic infection. The development of fibrosis surrounding granuloma formation can lead to significant health consequences resulting in morbidity and mortality.

As such, the reduced HIC status of schistosomiasis infected mice may result in a decreased level of HSC activation, which in turn results in lower deposition of collagen.</p><p>Denic and Agarwal propose that iron deficiency provides an evolutionarily-selected survival advantage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009594-Denic1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>.

Further to this, other studies such as the correlation of HIC and fibrosis, suggest that iron deficiency may also provide a survival advantage in chronic disease states including schistosomiasis.</p><p>The disease outcomes associated with schistosomiasis have a significant impact throughout many of the world's developing nations. The anemia associated with schistosomiasis is often labeled as anemia of chronic inflammation: however our findings suggest that this is likely not to be the case. We show that the iron regulatory gene <italic>Hepcidin</italic> responds to the decreased iron status. Furthermore, we have shown than increased iron available from pre-infection stores and possible ongoing iron absorption leads to increased fibrotic deposition within the liver. Together these results suggest that increasing the iron status of infected subjects may actually result in an increased disease burden. In light of this the utilization of dietary iron supplementation to resolve anemia associated with chronic schistosomiasis may result in more severe long term disease outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Animals</title><p>All mice (female; 10 weeks of age) were maintained on standard laboratory chow (Norco Stockfeeds, South Lismore, Australia).
