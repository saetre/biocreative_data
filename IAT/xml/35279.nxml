Our method relies on the expression in transfected cells of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) fusion proteins from cDNA library constructs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The selected clones encode EGFP fusion proteins that accumulate in the cell nucleus. Many of them were shown to harbor cDNA sequences corresponding to nuclear proteins that were translated in frame with the EGFP coding sequence. However, in nearly half of the selected clones the production of a fusion protein able to accumulate in the nucleus was shown to result from out of frame translation of the cDNA sequence fused to the EGFP coding region. On the average indeed, only one out of three cDNAs was positionned in frame with the EGFP coding sequence in the starting library. It was not expected that functional nuclear localization sequences would be generated at random (i.e. by out of frame translation of cDNA sequences) as often as was observed.</p><p>One clone, called "C60", that was isolated in this approach exhibited a significant DNA sequence similarity with a mouse EST sequence present in the EMBL/GenBank database (clone MNCb-0941, accession #: AU035837) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. No open reading frame (ORF) had been identified in this sequence yet, but the comparison of our dog sequence with the one from mouse identified a putative ORF on the basis that in the 385 bp-long region of similarity most of the differences occurred at the third position of base triplets in frame with a starting ATG codon. However, both sequences diverged before the stop codon was reached. Assuming that this was the correct reading frame, the cDNA portion in our EGFP fusion construct was translated out of frame (frame +2). This out of frame translation generated a 201aa-long sequence presenting several neighbouring clusters of arginine residues, which somehow resembled basic type nuclear localization signals. Although it could explain why this cDNA was isolated in the screening, it did not allow us to conclude whether the protein normally encoded by the cDNA is a nuclear protein or not. To further characterize the protein encoded by the cloned sequences we decided to isolate a complete copy of the corresponding mRNA.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec><title>Identification of the complete dog BCMP1 mRNA</title><p>The random primed cDNA insert harbored by clone C60 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] was used as probe to screen a dog thyroid oligo-dT primed cDNA library in &#x003bb; ZAPII phage vector [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Sixty positive clones were obtained out of the 500,000 cDNA clones screened. The longest insert (from clone C60-1) had a size of 4 kb and was entirely sequenced. Compared to the sequence of the insert of clone C60, this cDNA exhibited a 2 bp extension in 5' and a 2,944 bp extension in 3'. The 3' poly-A tail was preceded by a correctly placed AATAAA motif (fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The longest ORF corresponded to the putative ORF identified previously by comparing the sequence from clone C60 with that of the mouse EST present in the database (see background section). It extended over 543 bp (181 aa), from position 193 to 735 in the cDNA sequence. The translation initiator codon was located in a suitable sequence context according to Kozak's rule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. As in the interval an updated homologous mouse sequence had been deposited in the database (clone MNCb-0941, EMBL/GenBank acc. #: AB041540), the comparison of both sequences revealed that the coding region was entirely conserved in dog and mouse (fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Nucleotide sequence of dog BCMP1 cDNA</bold>.

These characteristics have been implicated in the rapid decay and restricted translation of mRNA molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. This 3' UTR was shorter in the mouse (1.3 kb) but several portions of it exhibited a remarkably high sequence conservation when compared with the dog sequence (fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Especially, the AT-rich character and the occurence of multiple ATTTA motifs were preserved. A search in the database also identified a human sequence (DKFZp564E153, EMBL/GenBank acc. #: AL049257) presenting a very high degree of sequence conservation over 2.5 kb with the 3' part of our dog cDNA (fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). The coding region of the mRNA was not contained in this human sequence and the observation of such an extended conservation of DNA sequence between UTRs from different species was unexpected. During the preparation of this manuscript, a completed human sequence appeared in the database (DKFZp761J17121, EMBL/GenBank acc. #:AL136550). The coding region was entirely conserved between dog, mouse and man, and most of the ATTTA motifs present in the dog sequence were also preserved in man (fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). It may suggest that BCMP1 mRNA is indeed subjected to tight post-transcriptional controls. However, whether the presence of these sequences really confers instability to the mRNA and restricts its translation remains to be determined experimentally.</p><p>A number of EST sequences from various species which were clearly homologous to dog BCMP1 could be retrieved from the database by BLAST searches. They indicated that the BCMP1 gene must also exist in the rat (e.g. acc. # BG381247), beef (e.g. acc. # AW352911), pig (e.g. acc. # BF704530) and in the fish Gillichthys mirabilis (acc. # AF266205), in addition to the already cited dog, mouse and man.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis of BCMP1 mRNA expression in the dog</title><p>Originally, the cDNA had been isolated from a dog thyroid cDNA library. In order to investigate whether the corresponding mRNA was also present in other cell types, a northern blot experiment was performed using poly-A+ RNA preparations from various dog tissues (fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Huge amounts of the 4 kb transcript were detected in brain cells. The presence of the mRNA was also detectable in most of the other RNA preparations but to lesser extents as compared to that found in brain RNA. The encoded protein is thus expected to be particularly abundant in the brain, unless the peculiar 3' UTR of the mRNA mediates a deep control on its translation (see above).</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Northern-blot analysis of BCMP1 mRNA expression.</bold> PolyA+ mRNA preparations from various dog tissues were probed with the coding region of BCMP1 cDNA.

A search for the presence of protein family signatures (PfamHMM on Expasy server) revealed the occurrence in the novel protein of sequence motifs ressembling significantly to one of the two motifs specific to the peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22) family of proteins and to the motif specific to the claudins (fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). The two identified signatures overlapped partially in the novel protein sequence. PMP22 and the related epithelial membrane proteins (EMPs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], as well as the claudins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], all belong to the superfamily of four-transmembrane domain (4TM) proteins. As could be expected, the search for the existence of putative transmembrane domains in the novel protein (HMMTOP on Expasy server) identified the presence of four of such domains (fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). The protein thus appeared to be a novel member of this large family of proteins, somehow related to PMP22/EMPs and the claudins. As these are integral membrane proteins, and as the mRNA encoding the novel protein was predominantly found in brain, the newly identified protein was termed "brain cell membrane protein 1" (BCMP1).</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Identification of PMP22 and Claudin family signatures in BCMP1 primary structure.</bold> Conserved residues are coloured (blue: PMP22 signature, red: claudin signature, violet: overlapping PMP22 and claudin signatures) and conserved spaces between specific residues are over - or underlined.

However, the intracellular amino-terminal arm proceeding the first transmembrane domain appeared to be much longer in BCMP1 than in its relatives.</p><p>In order to refine the classification of BCMP1 within the four-transmembrane domain protein family, a phylogenetic tree was constructed on the basis of the alignment of the available protein sequences related to the PMP22/EMPs and claudins (fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Dog BCMP1 and its mouse and human orthologs segregated as a distinct subgroup in the tree. Their closest relatives were the recently identified mouse PERP gene product [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and the protein encoded by the CG6982 gene in drosophila (EMBL/GenBank acc. #: AAF56054). This group of proteins thus shared primary structure determinants which defined a distinct subclass in the protein family.</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>Phvlogenetic tree of four-transmembrane proteins related to PMP22/EMPs and the claudins.</bold> See materials and methods section for the description of the tools used for the construction of the tree.

A fine granular fluorescence was observed all over the surface of cells expressing the EGFP-BCMP1 fusion protein, consistent with a plasma membrane localization of the tagged protein. A stronger fluorescence surrounding the cell nucleus was also observed. It indicated that a significant part of the expressed fusion protein accumulated in the endoplasmic reticulum. The pattern of EGFP fluorescence remained almost unchanged when the cells were permeabilized with saponin in order to stain the nuclear DNA (fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7D</xref>). This indicated that the fusion protein was embedded in the membranes and that it was not able to readily diffuse out of the cell.</p><fig position="float" id="F7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p><bold>Subcellular localization of the EGFP-BCMP1 fusion protein.</bold> The fusion protein was expressed in COS-7 cells.

Marker FH2548 is located close to the DMD locus in dog (distance: 4.4 cR<sub>5000</sub>, approx. 500 kb). More informations about dog RH maps can be found at <italic>http://www-recomgen.univrennes 1. fr/doggy. html.</italic></p><p>The human EST sequence DKFZp564E153 (EMBL/GenBank acc. #: AL049257) that corresponds to the 3' UTR of dog BCMP1 mRNA had been localized on chromosome X. The corresponding human genomic sequence could not be found by BLAST searches against sequences available in the database. However, by using the coding region of dog BCMP1 a significant match was identified with genomic sequences assigned to human chromosome 8 (clone RP11-31H18, EMBL/GenBank acc. #: AC041003). The similarity extended from position 1 to 418 in the human cDNA sequence (fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), which corresponded to the amino-terminal part of the protein up to the first extracellular loop. As an intron was found at this same position in PMP22, EMP-1 and EMP-3 genes, it appeared likely that we had identified the first coding exon of the human BCMP1 gene. PMP22, EMP-1 and EMP-3 genes all contain an additional intron separating the sequences encoding the first transmembrane domain and the first extracellular loop into two exons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. This intron is clearly not present in the human BCMP1 gene. In order to clarify the location of the gene in the human genome (chromosome X or chromosome 8 ?), the GeneBridge-4 WGRH panel was used to map the sequences encoding human BCMP1 using a pair of primers directing the amplification of a 666 bp-long fragment encompassing the entire first coding exon and the exon-intron junction. It revealed that the amplified segment was located on chromosome X, 0.20 cR<sub>3000</sub> from marker Wl-7096 and 6.51 cR<sub>3000</sub> from marker DXS1214. This location agreed with the previous assignment of the EST sequence DKFZp564E153. It also corresponds to the cytogenetic location Xp11.4. As the <italic>DMD</italic> gene maps at Xp21.2 in m an, it is thus also close to the <italic>BCMP1</italic> gene in this species. The chromosomal localization result revealed unambiguously the existence of a single BCMP1 locus in the human genome. As a consequence, it indicated that the sequences of the genomic clone RP11-31H18 had been inappropriately assigned to chromosome 8 instead of chromosome X in the database.</p><p>In the annotated human genome sequence available on the Ensembl server, the first coding exon of the human BCMP1 gene (gene ID:ENSG00000101959) is present in the chromosome X sequence (the sequences of clone RP11-31H18 have now been properly reassigned to chromosome X; see ContigView on Ensembl server). Part of the coding region of human BCMP1 and the whole 3' UTR region corresponding to DKFZp564E153, are still missing in the currently available human genome sequence.</p><p>Using primers derived from the rat EST236642 (EMBL/GenBank acc. # AI408352), which is 91% identical to the segment 2028-1434 of the mouse brain cDNA MNCb-0941, itself similar to dog BCMP1 cDNA, the rat gene (symbol: <italic>Bcmp1</italic>) was assigned to the chromosome X, between DXRat67 and DXRat28, at 497.9 cR along the MCW map (LOD score: 9.0; the local map is:DXRat67 - 29.9 CR - <italic>Bcmp1</italic> - 0.4 cR - DXRat28). The marker DXRat67 co-localizes with the gene <italic>Dmd</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], itself cytogenetically assigned to Xq22 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The rat genes <italic>Bcmp1</italic> and <italic>Dmd</italic> are thus closely linked, as was already observed in dog and man.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>We have described here the identification of the gene encoding a novel protein, called Brain Cell Membrane Protein 1 (BCMP1), which belongs to the large family of four-transmembrane proteins and appears to be highly expressed in the brain. The gene seems to be conserved on chromosome X within mammals, in close association with the DMD locus in man, rat and dog at least. The encoded BCMP1 protein shares significant ressemblances with both PMP22/EMPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and the claudins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], but exhibits distinct features, notably a predicted intracellular amino-terminal extension, which distinguishes it from the other known members of the family.</p><p>PMP22/EMPs are integral membrane proteins that seems to be implicated in various cellular processes, such as cellular differentiation, control of proliferation, and apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. PMP22 has been shown to play a critical role in peripheral nerves, where it is involved in the assembly of peripheral nerve myelin and in the regulation of proliferation and differentiation of Schwann cells. The claudins also constitute integral membrane proteins which are localized exclusively at tight junctions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Claudin-1, -2 and -3 have been shown to present calcium-independent cell-adhesion activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>Alterations in the PMP22 gene are responsible for hereditary motor and sensory neuropathies in human and rodents, known as Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1A (CMT1A) disease and <italic>Trembler (Tr)</italic> mouse respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Individuals presenting nonsyndromic recessive deafness (autosomal recessive deafness DFNB29) were recently shown to harbor mutations in the gene encoding claudin-14 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The Xp11.4 region of the human genome which comprises the BCMP1 gene has been linked to several forms of syndromic X-linked mental retardation, such as MRXS-2, -4, -6 and -10, and to a number of nonsyndromic MRX cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The TM4SF2 gene which apparently encodes another member of the superfamily of four transmembrane proteins, a tetraspanin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] more distantly related to BCMP1 than are PMP22/EMPs and the claudins, is located very close to the BCMP1 gene in man. Mutations in the TM4SF2 gene and gene inactivation resulting from chromosomal translocation have been shown to be involved in several cases of X-linked mental retardation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Whether the BCMP1 gene is also involved in such genetic disorders and what is the function of the encoded protein thus constitute the obvious questions which will support our future investigations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>DNA constructions</title><p>Standard DNA manipulations were conducted according to published procedures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].

The mapping results were obtained from the rat radiation hybrid map server at the Medical College Wisconsin<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="(http://rgd.mcw.edu/RHMAPSERVER/)"/>.</p></sec><sec><title>Bioinformatics</title><p>Sequences comparisons were performed using the BLAST tool (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST"/>). Protein sequences alignments and phylogenetic tree were constructed using Clustal X (Ver. 1.8) and TreeView (Ver. 1.6.1) respectively. Structural predictions based on protein sequences were obtained using programs available on the Expasy server (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.expasy.ch"/>). Localization of the BCMP1 gene in the human draft genome sequence was achieved using data and tools available on the Ensembl server (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ensembl.org"/>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Drs J.E.
