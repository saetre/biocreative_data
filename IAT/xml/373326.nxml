In the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> the Lig I enzyme Cdc9p is also required for mitochondrial DNA replication and repair. In this report, dual nuclear&#x02013;mitochondrial localization is demonstrated to be a property of the essential Lig I enzyme Cdc17 from the distantly related fission yeast <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>. Expression of nuclear and mitochondrial forms of Cdc17 from separate genes shows that, whereas expression of either protein alone is insufficient to restore viability to cells lacking endogenous Cdc17, co-expression restores full viability. In the nucleus, Lig I interacts with the sliding clamp proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) via a conserved PCNA interacting sequence motif known as a PIP box. Deletion of the PIP motif from the N-terminus of the nuclear form of Cdc17 fails to abolish Cdc17 function, indicating that PCNA binding by Cdc17 is not an absolute requirement for completion of S-phase.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Successful chromosomal DNA replication in eukaryotic cells requires the complex interplay of a variety of distinct essential factors in a spatially and temporally coordinated manner. One such factor is DNA ligase I (Lig I), the ATP-dependent enzyme responsible for the ligation of the Okazaki fragments generated during discontinuous synthesis of the lagging strand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh199c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh199c2">2</xref>). In yeasts, Lig I is essential for the completion of chromosomal DNA replication: budding or fission yeast cells carrying temperature-sensitive mutant forms of Lig I undergo S-phase arrest when shifted to the restrictive temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh199c3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh199c5">5</xref>), accumulating unligated Okazaki fragments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh199c6">6</xref>). Yeast Lig I also has a key role in a number of DNA repair processes, including nucleotide excision repair and base excision repair. As a consequence, yeast Lig I mutants are hypersensitive to a range of DNA damaging agents, such as UV, bleomycin and MMS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh199c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh199c8">8</xref>). In higher eukaryotes, Lig I is believed to play similar roles to the yeast enzyme, in both DNA replication and repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh199c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh199c10">10</xref>). However, unlike the situation in yeast, the mammalian Lig I protein is not essential for viability of cultured cells, although it is required for embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh199c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh199c12">12</xref>).</p><p>On the basis of comparative sequence analysis, the Lig I proteins can be considered to be composed of three distinct functional domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh199c1">1</xref>) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh199f1">1</xref>A): a non-catalytic N-terminal domain (NTD) that is poorly conserved from species to species but which contains a nuclear localization signal (NLS) as well as a binding site for the essential replication factor proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) (see below), a non-catalytic central domain (NCD) that is reasonably well conserved between other ATP-dependent DNA ligase proteins but whose function is unknown, and a catalytic domain related in sequence, and presumably structure, to that of other ATP-dependent ligases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh199c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh199c14">14</xref>). While the importance of the catalytic domain for Lig I function <italic>in vivo</italic> is not in doubt, the importance of the non-conserved N-terminal domain and the conserved NCD is less clear. It has been reported that a truncated form of the Cdc9 protein lacking the N-terminal 99 amino acids is able to support growth of <italic>cdc9</italic>&#x00394; cells, albeit when expressed at levels considerably higher than the endogenous Cdc9 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh199c15">15</xref>).</p><p>Higher eukaryotic Lig I has been shown to bind to the toroidal sliding clamp protein PCNA via a p21<sup>Cip1</sup>-like PCNA binding motif located at its extreme N-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh199c16">16</xref>). This eight-residue protein sequence motif, sometimes called a PIP (PCNA interacting protein) box (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh199c17">17</xref>), is required for localization of Lig I to sites of ongoing DNA replication (so-called replication factories) in the mammalian cell nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh199c18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh199c20">20</xref>). Experiments with mammalian cell extracts point to important roles for the interaction between Lig I and PCNA in both DNA replication and repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh199c21">21</xref>).</p><p>In addition to playing vital roles in nuclear DNA replication and repair, the <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> Lig I protein Cdc9p also plays an important role in mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh199c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh199c23">23</xref>). <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> cells express distinct nuclear and mitochondrial forms of Cdc9p from sequential in-frame start codons in the <italic>CDC9</italic> ORF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh199c22">22</xref>). The mitochondrial form of the protein is expressed from the first AUG codon in the ORF and is later processed to remove its N-terminal mitochondrial targeting sequence (MTS), giving rise to the mature mitochondrial Cdc9 protein. The nuclear form is expressed from a second AUG codon in the ORF and is unprocessed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh199c22">22</xref>). Campbell and co-workers have characterized the <italic>in vivo</italic> role of mitochondrial Cdc9, elegantly demonstrating vital roles for the enzyme in mtDNA maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh199c23">23</xref>). In the absence of mitochondrial Cdc9 function, budding yeast cells cannot grow on medium containing glycerol as the sole carbon source, indicative of impairment of mitochondrial function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh199c23">23</xref>). Moreover, inactivation of mitochondrial Cdc9p function during growth on glucose, or in stationary phase, results in a sharp decrease in mitochondrial DNA levels. Specific evidence for Cdc9 playing a key role in the repair of broken mtDNA was provided by targeting the restriction endonuclease EcoRI to mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh199c23">23</xref>).</p><p>In this paper, the results of analysis of the structure and function of Cdc17, the essential Lig I protein in the fission yeast <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh199c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh199c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh199c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh199c25">25</xref>) are presented. It is shown that, as in budding yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh199c22">22</xref>), the NTD of Cdc17 is sufficient to target GFP to both the nucleus and mitochondria, consistent with a model in which the use of alternate in-frame start codons results in the production of distinct nuclear and mitochondrial forms of the Cdc17 protein. Mitochondrial function is known to be essential for fission yeast viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh199c26">26</xref>). Here it is shown that co-expression of nuclear and mitochondrial forms <italic>in vivo</italic> restores full viability to <italic>cdc17</italic>&#x00394; cells, whereas expression of either protein alone does not. In addition, it is shown that the PCNA-binding PIP box at the N-terminus of the Cdc17 protein is not essential for nuclear Cdc17 function: cells co-expressing mitochondrial Cdc17 with a nuclear Cdc17 protein lacking the PIP box are viable. In contrast, Cdc17 proteins lacking the NCD are inactive <italic>in vivo</italic>, indicating that this domain plays a vital role in Cdc17 function.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Fission yeast strains and media</title><p>The fission yeast strains used in this study were: <italic>cdc17-K42</italic>, <italic>cdc17-L16</italic> and <italic>cdc17-M75</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh199c27">27</xref>), <italic>leu1-32</italic>/<italic>leu1-32 ura4-D18</italic>/<italic>ura4-D18 his7-366</italic>/<italic>his7-366 ade6-M210</italic>/<italic>ade6-M216</italic> h<sup>&#x02013;</sup>/h<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, and <italic>leu1-32</italic> h<sup>&#x02013;</sup>. <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> media and general techniques were essentially as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh199c28">28</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Construction of Cdc17-GFP expression plasmids</title><p>Plasmid pBluescript-GFP containing an <italic>Aequorea victoria</italic> GFP-S65T cDNA (a gift of Dr K.

Further evidence in support of this comes from computational analysis of the Cdc17 protein sequence: both the iPSORT (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hypothesiscreator.net/iPSORT/">http://hypothesiscreator.net/iPSORT/</ext-link>) and Mitoprot II (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ihg.gsf.de/ihg/mitoprot.html">http://ihg.gsf.de/ihg/mitoprot.html</ext-link>) applications predict Cdc17 to be localized to mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh199c39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh199c40">40</xref>).</p><p>In common with other eukaryotic Lig I proteins, the N-terminus of Cdc17 contains a PIP box (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh199c17">17</xref>), a canonical PCNA binding motif of the type first identified in the mammalian DNA replication inhibitor p21<sup>Cip1</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh199c41">41</xref>).

Transformed cells were routinely cultured in the presence of 5 &#x000b5;M thiamine (no fluorescence was detectable under these growth conditions), before being transferred to thiamine-free medium at 30&#x000b0;C for 12&#x02013;16 h to induce expression of the Cdc17-GFP fusion protein. Live cells were then viewed under the fluorescence microscope to determine GFP localization.</p><p>Initially, amino acids 1&#x02013;175 of Cdc17 were fused to GFP (S65T) to generate a Cdc17(1&#x02013;175)-GFP fusion protein. Amino acids 1&#x02013;175 correspond to the entire NTD of Cdc17 and a small part of the conserved NCD. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh199f2">2</xref>A shows cells expressing the Cdc17(1&#x02013;175)-GFP fusion protein: bright nuclear fluorescence is seen, with weaker signals in ribbon-like patterns in the cytoplasm. GFP alone localizes throughout the cell (data not shown). The cytoplasmic fluorescence pattern seen with Cdc17(1&#x02013;175)-GFP resembles previously published images of <italic>S.pombe</italic> mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh199c42">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh199c44">44</xref>), suggesting that Cdc17(1&#x02013;175)-GFP is targeted to both nucleus and mitochondria, as predicted by Stirling and co-workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh199c22">22</xref>). To confirm this, cells expressing Cdc17(1&#x02013;175)-GFP were stained with the mitochondrion-specific dye MitoTracker Red (see Materials and Methods). The cytoplasmic Cdc17-GFP and mitochondrial signals were seen to colocalize (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh199f2">2</xref>B and G). Thus, the N-terminal 175 amino acids of Cdc17 are sufficient to target GFP to both the nucleus and mitochondria of fission yeast cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Mitochondrial targeting sequence</title><p>To examine the role of amino acids 1&#x02013;20 for mitochondrial targeting, the localization of a Cdc17-GFP fusion protein in which these amino acids were deleted was examined. Consistent with expectations, the Cdc17(20&#x02013;175)-GFP fusion protein was exclusively nuclear in location (compare Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh199f2">2</xref>G with H), indicating that amino acids 1&#x02013;20, encompassing the putative MTS, are required for mitochondrial targeting.</p><p>Support for this result was obtained by indirect immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh199f3">3</xref>). Wild-type cells expressing either full-length Cdc17 or Cdc17-N&#x00394;31 from the intermediate strength nmt41 promoter in plasmid pREP41X (see below) were probed with affinity purified anti-Cdc17 C-terminal peptide antisera (see Materials and Methods). Note that in this case the proteins are not present as GFP fusions. Bound antibody was detected using fluorescent secondary antibodies conjugated with Cy3 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh199f3">3</xref>A and B). In cells expressing full-length Cdc17, both nuclear and cytoplasmic (mitochondrial) fluorescence was detected, whereas in cells expressing Cdc17-N&#x00394;31, the cytoplasmic signal is absent suggesting that the latter protein is incapable of localizing to mitochondria.</p></sec><sec><title>Nuclear localization signal</title><p>In order to map sequences responsible for nuclear localization of Cdc17, additional N-terminal truncated GFP fusion proteins were tested (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh199f2">2</xref>, results summarized in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh199f4">4</xref>). These results implicated sequences between amino acids 33 and 65 as being responsible for nuclear localization of Cdc17: while Cdc17(32&#x02013;175)-GFP was nuclear localized (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh199f2">2</xref>D), Cdc17(66&#x02013;175)-GFP was not (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh199f2">2</xref>E).</p><p>Inspection of the Cdc17 sequence shows that this region does not contain a classical NLS but does include a short stretch of basic amino acids (K62R63K64) that could form part of a bipartite or non-canonical NLS. To test this, the localization of a fusion protein in which these three basic amino acids were replaced with alanine was examined: Cdc17(1&#x02013;175/&#x00394;NLS)-GFP. Expression of this protein resulted in significantly reduced nuclear fluorescence (compare Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh199f2">2</xref>F with C). Amino acid residues 62&#x02013;64 are therefore necessary for effective nuclear targeting of Cdc17. Whether amino acids 32&#x02013;65 were sufficient for nuclear targeting was also examined, but they were not: the localization of a Cdc17(32&#x02013;65)-GFP fusion protein was indistinguishable from that of GFP alone (data not shown). Thus amino acids 62&#x02013;64, while being necessary for nuclear localization of Cdc17, are not sufficient, indicating that sequences beyond amino acid 65 play a vital role in nuclear targeting (see Discussion).</p></sec><sec><title>Requirement for in-frame AUG codon for nuclear Cdc17 localization</title><p>In budding yeast, translation of nuclear Cdc9p is initiated from an in-frame AUG codon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh199c22">22</xref>). To determine if this is also likely to be the case in fission yeast, the effect of mutating the second in-frame AUG codon in the <italic>cdc17</italic><sup><italic>&#x0002b;</italic></sup> ORF on the localization of the Cdc17(1&#x02013;175)-GFP fusion protein was examined. Replacing the AUG with GCG (resulting in a methionine to alanine change at amino acid 20 in the encoded protein) was found to cause a significant decrease in the amount of the Cdc17-GFP fusion detectable in the nucleus without affecting mitochondrial GFP levels. Cells expressing Cdc17(1&#x02013;175/M20A) are shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh199f2">2</xref>I. Similar results (normal mitochondrial localization, greatly reduced nuclear fluorescence) were also seen with Cdc17-M20A expressed in wild-type cells by indirect immunofluorescence (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh199f3">3</xref>C). Interestingly, simultaneous mutation of the second in-frame AUG and deletion of the putative NLS &#x0005b;the Cdc17(1&#x02013;175/M20A/&#x00394;NLS) protein&#x0005d; resulted in undetectable nuclear fluorescence (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh199f2">2</xref>J), indicating that residual nuclear localization seen with Cdc17(1&#x02013;175/M20A) is due to the presence of the intact NLS.</p></sec><sec><title>Functional assays</title><p>Next, the part played by the NTDs of Cdc17 in the <italic>in vivo</italic> function of the protein was investigated. To do this, PCR-mediated gene targeting was used to construct a diploid <italic>S.pombe</italic> strain in which the <italic>cdc17</italic><sup><italic>&#x0002b;</italic></sup> gene had been deleted from one chromosome and replaced with the <italic>kanMX6</italic> marker cassette (see Materials and Methods for details). Following meiosis and sporulation, tetrad dissection demonstrated that the <italic>cdc17::kanMX6</italic> spores were capable of germination but not colony formation. Thus, as expected, <italic>cdc17</italic><sup><italic>&#x0002b;</italic></sup> is an essential gene (data not shown).</p><p>To examine the role of the NTD of Cdc17, plasmid vectors were constructed to express various mutant forms of Cdc17 under the control of the thiamine-repressible nmt41 promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh199c29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh199c31">31</xref>). The choice of these expression conditions was based on quantitation of Cdc17 protein levels in transformed cells by western blotting using affinity purified anti-Cdc17 C-terminal peptide antisera (see Materials and Methods). These results indicated that the level of Cdc17 protein resulting from expression from the nmt41 promoter, in the presence of thiamine (i.e. with the promoter in its repressed state), was at most 2-fold higher than the endogeneous Cdc17 level (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh199f5">5</xref>A, lanes 5 and 6). Consistent with this, expression of Cdc17 under these conditions was found to be able to fully rescue <italic>cdc17::kanMX6</italic> cells without causing the cell elongation seen at higher or lower expression levels (<italic>cdc17::kanMX6</italic> cells carrying plasmid pREP41X-Cdc17 divided at 15.1 &#x000b1; 1.4 &#x000b5;m when grown in thiamine-containing minimal medium at 32&#x000b0;C, whereas <italic>cdc17::kanMX6</italic> cells carrying plasmid pREP81X-Cdc17 divided at 18.8 &#x000b1; 5.3 &#x000b5;m under the same conditions; expression levels from the nmt81 promoter in pREP81X are generally 10-fold lower than from the nmt41 promoter in pREP41X).</p><p>In all, 10 Cdc17 expression constructs were generated, including the full-length wild-type gene (diagrammed in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh199f5">5</xref>B). To test the ability of the mutant proteins to rescue <italic>cdc17::kanMX6</italic> cells, a plasmid shuffle strategy was used. First, a <italic>cdc17::kanMX6</italic> haploid strain containing plasmid pUR19-Cdc17 was isolated. This plasmid, which carries the entire <italic>cdc17</italic><sup><italic>&#x0002b;</italic></sup> gene region as well as the <italic>ura4</italic><sup><italic>&#x0002b;</italic></sup> selectable marker, was originally isolated from a genomic DNA library on the basis of its ability to rescue the temperature-sensitive <italic>cdc17-K42</italic> mutant (see Materials and Methods). Next, each of the pREP41X-Cdc17 plasmids was transformed into this strain. Transformants obtained carrying both pUR19-Cdc17 and the relevant pREP41X-Cdc17 plasmid were then grown up in supplemented EMMT medium (EMM containing 5 &#x000b5;M thiamine) and &#x0223c;1000 cells per plate plated on EMMT medium containing uracil and 5-FOA, to select for clones in which the ura<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> pUR19-Cdc17 plasmid had been lost. Following 4&#x02013;6 days incubation at 32&#x000b0;C, the results were scored by comparing colony number and size, and by microscopic examination. The results, summarized in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh199tb1">1</xref>, are discussed below.</p><p>In the absence of wild-type Cdc17 expression from plasmid pUR19-Cdc17, plasmid pREP41X was unable to support growth of the <italic>cdc17::kanMX6</italic> haploid: no colonies were formed on the 5-FOA plates (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh199tb1">1</xref> and Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh199f5">5</xref>C, bottom). Plasmid pREP41X-Cdc17 was able to fully support growth of the <italic>cdc17::kanMX6</italic> (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh199tb1">1</xref> and Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh199f5">5</xref>C, top). The <italic>cdc17::kanMX6</italic> cells carrying pREP41X-Cdc17 grew well and underwent cell division at a cell length indistinguishable from wild type (with cell size at division of &#x0223c;15.1 &#x000b5;m, as above). In contrast, none of the mutant constructs tested was able to rescue in cells grown in the presence of thiamine, to repress the nmt41 promoter (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh199f5">5</xref>C, middle, for an example and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh199tb1">1</xref> for summary). In all but one case, the cells formed abortive microcolonies of elongated cells. The exception to this were those cells expressing Cdc17-N&#x00394;19. In this case, elongated cells were not seen; instead the microcolonies comprised a small number of swollen, almost spherical cells.</p><p>The ability of the mutant proteins to rescue the <italic>cdc17::kanMX6</italic> strain when grown in the absence of thiamine was also tested. Under these conditions, expression from the nmt41 promoter is induced, leading to significant overproduction of the Cdc17 protein: Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh199f5">5</xref>A (lanes 1&#x02013;4) shows that the level of wild-type Cdc17 protein present in cells grown in the absence of thiamine is 100&#x02013;200-fold greater than endogenous Cdc17 levels. Consistent with results obtained in other organisms, overproduction of all but two of the mutant Cdc17 proteins was sufficient to restore viability to <italic>cdc17::kanMX6</italic> haploid cells (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh199tb1">1</xref>). The exceptions were the catalytically inactive Cdc17-K416A protein and Cdc17-N&#x00394;390 (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh199tb1">1</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Separate expression of nuclear and mitochondrial Cdc17 proteins</title><p>Next, whether co-expressed nuclear and mitochondrial forms of the Cdc17 would support growth of <italic>cdc17::kanMX6</italic> cells was tested (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh199f6">6</xref>A). To achieve this, a <italic>cdc17::kanMX6</italic> haploid strain carrying plasmid pREP41X-Cdc17-N&#x00394;19 was created by transforming this plasmid into <italic>cdc17::kanMX6</italic> cells carrying pUR19-Cdc17 and counter-selecting using 5-FOA on medium lacking thiamine to lose pUR19-Cdc17. Under these conditions (i.e. with the nmt promoter fully derepressed due to the absence of thiamine in the growth medium), the substantial overproduction of the nuclear Cdc17-N&#x00394;19 protein is sufficient to support growth of the <italic>cdc17::kanMX6</italic> cells. Next, this strain was transformed with plasmids pREP42X, pREP42X-Cdc17-M20A and pREP42X-Cdc17-M20A&#x00394;NLS expressing mitochondrial Cdc17 proteins. (Note that, in contrast to the <italic>LEU2</italic>-containing pREP41X, pREP42X carries the <italic>ura4</italic><sup><italic>&#x0002b;</italic></sup> marker, allowing both this plasmid and pREP41X to be selected independently in the same cell.) Transformants obtained in the absence of thiamine were then grown in liquid medium and plated onto EMM medium containing thiamine, to repress the nmt41 promoters in both plasmids.</p><p>The results of this experiment were as follows. As noted above, in cells grown in the presence of thiamine, plasmid pREP41X-Cdc17-N&#x00394;19 alone is unable to rescue the <italic>cdc17::kanMX6</italic> defect (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh199tb1">1</xref>). Predictably, when the <italic>cdc17::kanMX6</italic> cells also contain pREP42X, the same result is seen. However, when pREP42X is replaced by either pREP42X-Cdc17-M20A or pREP42X-Cdc17-M20A&#x00394;NLS, growth on thiamine is restored (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh199f6">6</xref>B, left). Cells carrying both plasmids displayed normal cell morphology and underwent cell division at a cell length (14.4 &#x000b1; 3.3 &#x000b5;m) close to wild type. These results indicate that co-expression of nuclear and mitochondrial forms of Cdc17 is able to substitute for loss of <italic>cdc17</italic><sup><italic>&#x0002b;</italic></sup> function.</p></sec><sec><title>Role of PCNA binding motif (PIP box) <italic>in vivo</italic></title><p>Next, the same assay was used to test whether expression of the PIP-box mutant Cdc17-N&#x00394;31 would be sufficient to rescue <italic>cdc17::kanMX6</italic> when co-expressed with either of the mitochondrial proteins Cdc17-M20A or Cdc17-M20A&#x00394;NLS (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh199f6">6</xref>A). It was found that, in both cases, co-expression of the nuclear Cdc17-N&#x00394;31 protein alongside the mitochondrial Cdc17 resulted in a significant reduction in colony forming ability, to only &#x0223c;15&#x00025; of the numbers of the Cdc17-N&#x00394;19 control (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh199f6">6</xref>B, right, for Cdc17-M20A). In addition, the cells were highly elongated compared with the control (32.2 versus 14.4 &#x000b5;m). It is possible to conclude from this that the PIP box makes a significant contribution to nuclear Cdc17 function but that it is not essential for function. Interestingly, when the viable colonies from the first plates were grown up in liquid medium and replated onto the same medium, viability was restored to near control levels (&#x0223c;80&#x00025; compared with &#x0003e;95&#x00025; for similarly treated control cells) and cell size at cell division was only marginally increased over the control. In short, prolonged growth results in improved cell viability, with the viable cells dividing at a reduced cell size compared with the initial plating on thiamine-containing minimal medium. The most likely explanation for this is that cells with elevated Cdc17 levels are being selected for. However, immunoblotting showed that no significant increases in Cdc17 protein level could be detected over time in cells growing on thiamine-containing medium (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Overproduction of Cdc17 proteins</title><p>Although the PIP box is not absolutely required for nuclear Cdc17 function, it was found that gross overproduction of Cdc17 proteins containing the PIP box interfered with cell cycle progression. Specifically, overproduction, in wild-type cells, of full-length Cdc17 from the strong nmt1 promoter in plasmid pREP3X caused cell elongation, with cells undergoing division at &#x0223c;22.3 &#x000b5;m. This effect was also seen when the overproduced protein lacked the MTS at the N-terminus (Cdc17-N&#x00394;19; cell size at cell division of &#x0223c;21.4 &#x000b5;m, compared with wild-type cells at &#x0223c;15 &#x000b5;m), or when the entire C-terminal catalytic domain was deleted (Cdc17-C&#x00394;391; &#x0223c;21.1 &#x000b5;m) but was reduced when the PIP box was deleted (Cdc17-N&#x00394;31; &#x0223c;17.6 &#x000b5;m). A construct in which sequences encoding the Cdc17 PIP box were replaced with those encoding the PIP box of the large subunit of fission yeast RF-C (Cdc17-N&#x00394;31-R, see Materials and Methods for details) was also tested. Interestingly, Cdc17-N&#x00394;31-R was a more potent inhibitor of cell cycle progression than Cdc17-N&#x00394;19; cells carrying plasmid pREP41X-Cdc17-N&#x00394;31-R underwent division at &#x0223c;21 &#x000b5;m in the absence of thiamine, compared with &#x0223c;15 &#x000b5;m for cells carrying pREP41X-Cdc17-N&#x00394;19.</p></sec><sec><title>Role of the conserved non-catalytic domain (NCD)</title><p>In addition to analysing the function of the NTD of Cdc17, the role of the adjacent domain, the conserved NCD, was also examined. The NCD is a conserved feature of all eukaryotic and archaeal ATP-dependent DNA ligases, although the degree of conservation between proteins from different species varies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh199c1">1</xref>). To test whether the NCD was required for Cdc17 function in fission yeast, a plasmid expressing a truncated form of Cdc17, called Cdc17-N&#x00394;390, lacking both the NTD and the NCD, was constructed. pREP41X-Cdc17-N&#x00394;390 was transformed into <italic>cdc17::kanMX6</italic> cells containing pUR19-Cdc17, and transformants plated on medium containing 5-FOA but lacking thiamine, to ensure high level expression of Cdc17-N&#x00394;390. No colonies were obtained by this method (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh199f7">7</xref>A), suggesting that Cdc17-N&#x00394;390, unlike Cdc17-N&#x00394;125, is unable to compensate for loss of the wild-type Cdc17 protein when expressed from pREP41X. However, the difference observed between Cdc17-N&#x00394;125 and Cdc17-N&#x00394;390 may simply be due the relative level of the two proteins present in cells, as western blotting of wild-type cells transformed with either pREP41X-Cdc17-N&#x00394;125 or pREP41X-Cdc17-N&#x00394;390 showed that the Cdc17-N&#x00394;390 protein was present at low levels only (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh199f7">7</xref>B). However, when the Cdc17-N&#x00394;390 protein was expressed under the control of the full-strength nmt1 promoter in plasmid pREP3X to levels considerably higher than those of the endogenous Cdc17 protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh199f7">7</xref>B, compare lanes 1 and 6), it was still unable to rescue either <italic>cdc17::kanMX6</italic> or the temperature-sensitive <italic>cdc17-K42</italic> and <italic>cdc17-L16</italic> alleles under restrictive conditions (data not shown).</p><p>These experiments suggest that the NCD plays an important, indeed indispensable, role in Cdc17 function <italic>in vivo</italic>. In support of this, the mutation in the temperature-sensitive <italic>cdc17-K42</italic> allele was found to map to the NCD: an invariant glutamate at position 298 in the wild-type protein is changed to lysine in Cdc17-K42 (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh199tb2">2</xref> and Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh199f7">7</xref>C, see Materials and Methods).

Both are proline to serine changes, at amino acids 584 and 679, respectively.

Proline 584 itself is conserved between the fission yeast and budding yeast Lig I proteins, but not in higher eukaryotes. In contrast, proline 679, the site of the Cdc17-M75 mutation, is located in a region of relatively low sequence similarity between species, between conserved motifs V and VI. The fission yeast protein possesses a two amino insertion in this region (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh199f7">7</xref>C).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Lig I plays key roles in DNA replication and repair in eukaryotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh199c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh199c2">2</xref>).

In this paper, Cdc17, the essential Lig I protein of fission yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh199c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh199c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh199c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh199c25">25</xref>), is shown to be targeted to both the nucleus and mitochondria (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh199f2">2</xref>). Mitochondrial targeting is dependent upon the presence of an N-terminal MTS, a putative amphipathic &#x003b1;-helix, and is essential for cell viability (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh199f1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh199f4">4</xref>).</p><p>Nuclear localization of Lig I in fission yeast is also dependent upon sequences located in the NTD of the protein (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh199f1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh199f4">4</xref>). Replacement of amino acids lysine 62, arginine 63 and lysine 64 with three consecutive alanine residues abolishes nuclear Cdc17-GFP targeting, suggesting that these form part of the Cdc17 NLS. Since amino acids 32&#x02013;65 alone were unable to localize GFP, sequences beyond this must also be required. Previous studies on conserved features of NLSs have identified two major groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh199c45">45</xref>). Canonical NLSs comprise a single stretch of basic amino acids. The NLS of SV40 large T-antigen (PKKKRK) is one such sequence. Bipartite NLSs comprise two stretches of basic amino acids, generally separated by a spacer of &#x0223c;10 residues. In addition to these two groups, other types of NLSs that show no obvious resemblance to the above and which are heterogeneous in nature have been identified experimentally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh199c46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh199c47">47</xref>). With respect to Cdc17, inspection of the NTD sequence identifies a second cluster of basic amino acids (KKQK) spanning residues 97&#x02013;100 that could form part of a non-standard bipartitite NLS but further mutational analysis will be required to determine if this is the case.</p><p>The sliding clamp PCNA plays an important role in many aspects of DNA metabolism in eukaryotic cells, and a large number of PCNA binding proteins have been identified. Many, though not all, of these proteins interact with PCNA via a short protein sequence motif called a PIP box (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh199c17">17</xref>) that was first identified in studies of the mammalian DNA replication and cell cycle inhibitor p21<sup>Cip1</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh199c41">41</xref>). In the case of Lig I, the mammalian and yeast proteins possess a PIP box at or near their N-termini that is distinct from their NLS sequences. Experiments with the human enzyme have clearly demonstrated a role for the PIP box in directing localization of Lig I to sites of ongoing DNA replication, so-called replication foci or replication factories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh199c20">20</xref>). The results presented here demonstrate that the presence of the PIP box is non-essential for fission yeast Cdc17 function, although the viability of cells expressing nuclear Cdc17 proteins lacking the PIP box is somewhat compromised (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh199f6">6</xref>). Visualization of Cdc17 lacking the PIP box by indirect immunofluorescence (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh199f3">3</xref>B) reveals a nuclear staining pattern that is indistinguishable from that seen with the full-length protein, although the latter also localizes to the mitochondria (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh199f3">3</xref>A). However, at the level of resolution used in this study, it is not possible to conclude that the PIP box plays no role in the intranuclear localization of Cdc17. It is unclear, for example, whether the punctate intranuclear staining patterns observed (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh199f3">3</xref>A and B) represent sites of ongoing replication or whether they present an artifact of the fixation procedure.</p><p>The importance of the conserved NCD for Cdc17 function is also highlighted by this study. Comparative sequence analysis identifies the NCD as a conserved feature of all three eukaryotic ATP-dependent cellular ligases (I, III and IV) as well as viral and archaeal enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh199c1">1</xref>). The level of sequence similarity between NCDs from ligases from different groups (e.g. human Lig III and Lig IV) is not great but can be detected by reiterative &#x003c8;-BLAST searching irrespective of the input query sequence. Within a single group, the level of sequence identity between NCDs is lower than the level of sequence identity displayed by the catalytic domains from the same enzymes. Deleting the NCD abolishes Cdc17 function even when the truncated protein is present at levels higher than endogenous Cdc17 in wild-type cells. Deletion of the NCD also results in significant reduction in protein stability (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh199f7">7</xref>). One of the three existing temperature-sensitive mutations in Cdc17 (Cdc17-K42) maps to the NCD, the other two being located in the catalytic domain. Taken together these results provide clear evidence that the NCD plays an essential role in Cdc17 function, consistent with the degree of sequence conservation shown across species.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkh199f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> (<bold>A</bold>) Domain structure of fission yeast Cdc17 protein.
