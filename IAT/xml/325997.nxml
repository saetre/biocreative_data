By oligonucleotide hybridization, we have isolated 5 dscDNA clones to human hepatic apo A-I mRNA. One of these clones (pA1-3) was completely sequenced. It has 878 bp plus a poly A tail of 48 and includes all the coding and 3'-untranslated regions of the mRNA and part of the 5'-untranslated region. It predicts a peptide sequence of 267 amino acids (including the 24 amino acid prepropeptides) which is very similar to the sequence reported by Brewer et al., (1978) Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun. 80:623-630. The predicted signal peptide sequence is highly homologous to the rat apoA-I signal peptide. There is no evidence for any internally repeated segments in apoA-I either at the amino acid or at the DNA level. Using pA1-3 as a probe, we have detected on Northern gels apo A-I mRNA sequences of approximately 1100 nucleotides in human hepatic and baboon hepatic and intestinal RNAs, but not in RNAs from baboon skeletal muscle, kidney or spleen. The demonstration of apo A-I mRNA sequences in specific organs is important to our concept of "reverse cholesterol transport".</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00356-0282-a" xlink:role="3712"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00356-0273.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3703"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00356-0274.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3704"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00356-0275.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3705"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00356-0276.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3706"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00356-0277.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3707"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00356-0278.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3708"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00356-0279.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3709"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00356-0280.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3710"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00356-0281.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3711"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00356-0282.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3712"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00356-0283.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3713"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00356-0284.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3714"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00356-0285.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3715"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
