We explored the role of the conserved OmcB protein in <italic>C. pneumoniae</italic> infections, using yeast display technology. (i) Yeast cells presenting OmcB were found to adhere to human epithelial cells. (ii) Pre-incubation of OmcB yeast cells with heparin, but not other glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), abrogated adhesion. (iii) Pre-treatment of the target cells with heparinase inhibited adherence, and GAG-deficient CHO cell lines failed to bind OmcB yeast. (iv) A heparin-binding motif present near the N-terminus of OmcB is required for host cell binding.

Exposure to <italic>C. pneumoniae</italic> is very common and the prevalence of infection increases with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Grayston, 2000</xref>). <italic>C. pneumoniae</italic> infections cause approximately 10% of community-acquired pneumonia and 5% of bronchitis and sinusitis cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Grayston, 1992</xref>). In addition, <italic>C. pneumoniae</italic> infections have been implicated in the aetiology of stroke, atherosclerosis, Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">Saikku, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">Lindsberg and Grau, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">Mussa <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b68">Stratton and Wheldon, 2006</xref>). Evidence for an association between <italic>C. pneumoniae</italic> and atherogenesis stems from the fact that these bacteria have been detected in atherosclerotic plaques and isolated in culture from coronary arteries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">Kuo <italic>et al.</italic>, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">Maass <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>). Furthermore, chlamydia are also associated with various chronic diseases, ranging from reactive arthritis to asthma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">Kuo <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b74">Von Hertzen, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b83">Zeidler <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). It is not clear whether persistence of an unresolved chlamydial infection or repeated chlamydial infections are relevant for these chronic diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">Hogan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>).</p><p>Chlamydia are pathogenic, Gram-negative, obligate intracellular eubacteria with a unique biphasic developmental cycle involving two different cell forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">Moulder <italic>et al.</italic>, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Abdelrahman and Belland, 2005</xref>). Infectious but metabolically inert elementary bodies (EBs) adhere to eukaryotic host cells, stimulating their own uptake. Internalized EBs remain in an intracellular compartment termed an inclusion, where they differentiate into metabolically active but non-infectious reticulate bodies (RBs), which divide by binary fission. After 9&#x02013;11 generations the RBs re-differentiate into EBs, which are then released from the host cell to start a new round of infection (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Abdelrahman and Belland, 2005</xref>).</p><p>Bacterial infection is a multifactorial process that can be divided into several distinct stages. Bacterial adherence to host cell surfaces is the first step in the establishment of an infection and is a prerequisite for all subsequent events. At this early stage of infection the specificity of the pathogen&#x02013;host cell interaction is determined by bacterial surface proteins (adhesins) and receptors on the host cell surface. These specific interactions may also help determine the cell and tissue tropism of the bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Finlay and Falkow, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Boyle and Finlay, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">Pizarro-Cerda and Cossart, 2006</xref>). Glycosaminoglycan (GAG) structures on the mammalian cell surface play an important role in interactions with many microbial pathogens, and are recognized by a number of viral, bacterial and protozoan adhesins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">Rostand and Esko, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b75">Wadstrom and Ljungh, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">Menozzi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). Chlamydia can infect a variety of non-phagocytic animal cell types, indicating that the bacterial adhesins recognize conserved cellular receptors and/or that EB attachment is mediated by a variety of different adhesin&#x02013;receptor combinations (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Hackstadt, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Abdelrahman and Belland, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Dautry-Varsat <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Campbell and Kuo, 2006</xref>). Despite the essential role of the adhesion process, we have only limited knowledge of the nature of the chlamydial adhesins and their receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Dautry-Varsat <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Campbell and Kuo, 2006</xref>). A number of studies have implied that GAGs are required for the initial phase of the chlamydial EB attachment process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b84">Zhang and Stephens, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Chen and Stephens, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b82">Zaretzky <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Chen <italic>et al.</italic>, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Davis and Wyrick, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Gutierrez-Martin <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>). Thus, the addition of exogenous heparan sulphate, or the heparan sulphate analogue heparin, inhibits infection by <italic>C. trachomatis</italic>, <italic>C. psittaci</italic> and <italic>C. pneumoniae</italic>, although the degree of inhibition observed is dependent on the chlamydial species, biovar, isolate and human cell line used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Chen and Stephens, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Gutierrez-Martin <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b71">Taraktchoglou <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b78">Wuppermann <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b79">Yabushita <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Beswick <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Darville <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b80">Yan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Specifically, comparative studies of the two <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> biovars, the trachoma biovar (serovars A through K) and the lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) biovar (serovars L1, L2 and L3), which differ in their infection characteristics and invasiveness in clinical disease, display different GAG dependencies (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Campbell and Kuo, 2006</xref>). While heparan sulphate blocks binding of the LGV biovar to both non-polarized and polarized human epithelial cells, binding of serovar B or E EBs is only partly inhibited or even unaffected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Chen and Stephens, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Davis and Wyrick, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b71">Taraktchoglou <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>). This suggests that the more invasive LGV biovars, which are primarily submucosal pathogens, may use heparan sulphate as an adhesin to colonize basolateral domains of the mucosal epithelium, while serovar E may use other GAGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Campbell and Kuo, 2006</xref>). For <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> a trimolecular mechanism has been proposed, in which GAG-like structures serve as a bridge between an adhesin on the EB and a receptor on the host cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b84">Zhang and Stephens, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">Rasmussen-Lathrop <italic>et al.</italic>, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b67">Stephens <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). For <italic>C. pneumoniae</italic> it has been shown that binding of EBs to heparin sulphate-like GAGs on the host cell surface is a prerequisite for subsequent infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b78">Wuppermann <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>). More recently it was reported, for other <italic>C. pneumoniae</italic> strains and other eukaryotic cell lines, that GAGs on the surfaces of both target cells and EBs may play a role in invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Beswick <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b80">Yan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). The role of heparan sulphate-like GAGs in infection by <italic>C. pneumoniae</italic> is also supported by the fact that the induction of pro-inflammatory cytokine gene expression by a <italic>C. pneumoniae</italic> infection depends on adherence of the bacteria to human lung epithelial cells and can be blocked by addition of heparin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b81">Yang <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>).</p><p>Indeed, the GAG-binding outer membrane protein OmcB from <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> L2 was identified by heparin affinity chromatography, although its role in the chlamydial adhesion process and its relevance for infection remained unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66">Stephens <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>). OmcB was originally identified as a major component of the chlamydial outer membrane complex, and is conserved among all chlamydial species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b76">Wagels <italic>et al.</italic>, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Hatch, 1999</xref>). OmcB has been variously localized to the periplasm or the outer membrane of EBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b77">Watson <italic>et al.</italic>, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Everett and Hatch, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b72">Ting <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">Mygind <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66">Stephens <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>). However, during chlamydial infections OmcB induces a strong antibody response, suggesting that it is readily accessible to the humoral immune response, which suggests a surface localization for it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b76">Wagels <italic>et al.</italic>, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">Mygind <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Cunningham and Ward, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Klein <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">Portig <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>).</p><p>The absence of a genetic system for chlamydia makes the identification and functional characterization of chlamydial proteins involved in the adhesion process particularly difficult. To overcome these limitations we have used a new test system for the functional characterization of adhesion proteins. Display of heterologous proteins on the surface of phages or microorganisms like <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, Gram-positive bacteria or yeast has proven to be extremely useful in a number of experimental settings, such as the development of a live vaccine, design of whole-cell biocatalysts or screening of antibody libraries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Georgiou <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">Kondo and Ueda, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Jostock and Dubel, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">Mullen <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Yeast surface display technology offers the additional advantages that (i) all cloning steps are readily performed by homologous recombination in yeast and (ii) the size of the protein to be presented is not a limitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Boder and Wittrup, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b70">Swers <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). In the yeast display system yeast cells express a fusion protein comprising the a-agglutinin protein Aga2 linked to the protein of interest; this is then secreted and binds via disulphide bridges to the cell wall protein Aga1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Boder and Wittrup, 1997</xref>).</p><p>In order to study the function of the <italic>C. pneumoniae</italic> OmcB protein we established a yeast adhesion system in which the binding of live OmcB-presenting yeast cells to human cells could be studied. Here we show that the OmcB protein from <italic>C. pneumoniae</italic> mediates adhesion to human epithelial HEp-2 cells. OmcB adhesion is dependent on the N-terminal domain of the protein and a heparin-binding motif present in this region. Infection inhibition experiments using recombinant <italic>C. pneumoniae</italic> OmcB protein or OmcB antibodies reveal that OmcB is essential for infection, and specifically is involved in the adhesion of the infectious EBs to the target cells. The ability of OmcB proteins to bind to human cells seems to be a general property of chlamydia, as OmcB from the <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> serovars L1 and E (and from <italic>Chlamydia caviae</italic>) adheres to HEp-2 cells. Intriguingly binding of the OmcB protein from <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> serovar E to HEp-2 cells is completely independent of heparin, suggesting differences in the mode of host cell invasion <italic>in vivo</italic>. Our mutational analysis of the OmcB proteins from <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> L1 and E indicates that binding can be switched from heparin independence to heparin dependence by changing a single amino acid.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>The yeast display system identifies <italic>C. pneumoniae</italic> OmcB as an adhesion protein</title><p>The adhesion of <italic>C. pneumoniae</italic> to host cells is the first and crucial step in bacterial pathogenesis. As this pathogen cannot be genetically manipulated, we used the heterologous yeast display system to study the adhesion properties of chlamydial proteins. In this system, <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> cells express heterologous proteins on their surfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1A</xref>). The protein of interest is expressed as a fusion protein with the yeast a-agglutinin receptor subunit Aga2, which is anchored to the yeast cell wall via its interaction with the resident Aga1 subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Boder and Wittrup, 1997</xref>). Expression of Aga2 and Aga2 fusion proteins occurs via the galactose-inducible <italic>GAL1</italic> promoter on a plasmid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">Boder and Wittrup, 1997</xref>). We expressed Aga2, Aga2 fused to the adhesion domain [amino acid (aa) 790 to aa 986] of the <italic>Yersinia pseudotuberculosis</italic> invasin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Dersch and Isberg, 1999</xref>), referred to here as Aga2&#x02013;Inv, and Aga2&#x02013;OmcB (<italic>C. pneumoniae</italic> OmcB) in yeast. All three proteins were expressed in similar amounts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1B</xref>), and Aga2&#x02013;Inv and Aga2&#x02013;OmcB could be detected on the yeast cell surface with anti-invasin and anti-OmcB antibodies respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1C</xref>).</p><fig id="fig01" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><title>Yeast cells expressing Aga2&#x02013;Inv or Aga2&#x02013;OmcB adhere to human cells.</title><p>A.

In contrast to untransformed yeast cells or yeast cells expressing Aga2, yeast cells presenting the Aga2&#x02013;Inv fusion protein on the cell surface showed a high affinity for HEp-2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1D</xref>). In particular, we found that the ratio of Aga2&#x02013;Inv yeast cells to HEp-2 cells correlated directly with the number of yeast cells adhering to the human cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1D</xref>). This was not observed for untransformed yeast cells or Aga2-expressing yeast cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1D</xref>). Thus, the yeast display system is indeed a suitable model with which to study the adhesion properties of bacterial proteins.</p><p>Microscopic inspection revealed that Aga2&#x02013;Inv yeast cells mainly bound laterally to HEp-2 cells and bud-forming yeast cells showed uniform binding via the mother cell and the bud (data not shown).

A sequence comparison of OmcB homologues from various chlamydial species revealed that this region of the <italic>C. pneumoniae</italic> OmcB protein harboured two putative heparin-binding motifs (amino acids 53&#x02013;58 and 59&#x02013;64 respectively) with the consensus sequence XBBXBX (X = hydropathic amino acid, B = basic amino acid) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Hileman <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3B</xref>). The first motif is conserved among OmcB proteins from all chlamydia, with the exception of environmental Parachlamydia. To test whether such a heparin-binding motif was required for adhesion, we replaced several of the basic amino acids found in heparin-binding motif I with alanines, and tested the ability of the mutant protein to function in our yeast adhesion assay. All mutations were generated in the N-terminal variant OmcB<sub>1&#x02212;100</sub>. Yeast cells expressing Aga2&#x02013;OmcB and Aga2&#x02013;OmcB<sub>1&#x02212;100</sub> display comparable levels of adhesion to HEp-2 cells, indicating that the OmcB<sub>1&#x02212;100</sub> segment is mainly responsible for adhesion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3A and B</xref>). Using site-directed mutagenesis, we generated OmcB<sub>1&#x02212;100</sub> variants with single-amino-acid changes at positions 54 (lysine to alanine), 55 (lysine to alanine) and 57 (arginine to alanine) respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3B</xref>). Substitution of the lysine residues decreased adhesion by 5% or 10% (OmcB<sub>1&#x02212;100</sub>K<sub>54</sub>A and OmcB<sub>1&#x02212;100</sub>K<sub>55</sub>A respectively) compared with wild-type OmcB<sub>1&#x02212;100</sub>. Replacement of the arginine residue reduced adhesion by 35% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3B</xref>).

However, there have been conflicting reports concerning the localization of OmcB in <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> L2 and in <italic>C. psittaci</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Everett and Hatch, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b72">Ting <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">Mygind <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66">Stephens <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>). Interestingly, in those cases where a surface localization was found, the authors described the specific accessibility of the OmcB N-terminus on the EB cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b72">Ting <italic>et al.</italic>, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66">Stephens <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>). The surface accessibility of the <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> OmcB N-terminus has also been predicted based on the hydrophilicity profile of the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">Mygind <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>). These data are in accordance with our finding that the OmcB adhesin function is located within the first 100 N-terminal amino acids.</p></sec><sec><title>The N-terminal region of OmcB is essential for host cell adhesion and infection</title><p>The <italic>C. pneumoniae</italic> OmcB protein is very basic: 60 of its 556 amino acids (11%) are arginine or lysine residues. However, the N-terminal region includes a particularly basic domain (aa 41 to aa 79) with 26% basic residues (10 aa/38 aa) and our deletion analysis revealed that the heparan sulphate binding region was localized to this basic domain. Furthermore, yeast cells presenting just the N-terminal 100 amino acids (OmcB<sub>1&#x02212;100</sub>) including the basic domain exhibited the same adhesion properties as the full-length OmcB protein, indicating that the N-terminal portion is responsible for the entire adhesive activity of OmcB. A detailed amino acid sequence analysis of the basic domain revealed that the OmcB protein carries a sequence motif which perfectly fits the consensus sequence XBBXBX identified previously as one of three major binding motifs found in a variety of heparin-binding proteins, including OmcB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Cardin and Weintraub, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">Hileman <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66">Stephens <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Capila and Linhardt, 2002</xref>). Interestingly, only in the <italic>C. pneumoniae</italic> OmcB protein is this motif duplicated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Fig. 3B</xref>). Our mutational analysis of the N-terminal motif (motif I) within the OmcB protein revealed that changing all three basic residues to alanine completely abolished the adhesion of OmcB yeast cells to HEp-2 cells, proving the relevance of the motif for binding of heparan sulphate-like GAGs. It remains to be seen whether motif II present in the <italic>C. pneumoniae</italic> OmcB also contributes to GAG and HEp-2 cell binding. It is possible that the duplication of the heparin-binding motif confers unique properties on the <italic>C. pneumoniae</italic> OmcB protein.</p></sec><sec><title>The OmcB proteins from <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> serovars L1 and E differ in the heparin dependence of their adhesion behaviour</title><p>The OmcB protein is highly conserved among chlamydial species (70&#x02013;84% overall identity). Interestingly, the highest sequence identity of 90&#x02013;100% is limited to the C-terminal part of the proteins (aa 96 to aa 556), while the basic domain carrying the heparin-binding motif (aa 41 to aa 79) exhibits high sequence diversity, with identity scores of 18&#x02013;29% only (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">Mygind <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>). Nevertheless, our analysis revealed that the OmcB proteins from <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> L1 and E and from <italic>C. caviae</italic> all adhere to epithelial human cells with similar affinities. Likewise, it has been shown recently that <italic>E. coli</italic> cells expressing OmcB from <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> L1 adhered to HeLa and Hec-1B cells, and that recombinant OmcB protein, as well as an anti-OmcB antibody, reduced the incidence of <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Fadel and Eley, 2007</xref>).</p><p>We assume that host cell binding by these various OmcB proteins always occurs via the N-terminal basic domain carrying the heparin-binding motif. Because the OmcB protein sequences are almost identical among the various <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> serovars, they should have very similar, if not identical, adhesion properties. Surprisingly however, binding of OmcB from serovar E to human cells was found not to be heparin dependent, while OmcB from serovar L1 showed heparin dependency. Even a hundred-fold increase in the amount of heparin, usually sufficient to abrogate any OmcB binding to HEp-2 cells, failed to reduce binding (data not shown). Sequence comparison revealed that within the basic domains only three amino acids differ between the two proteins. The mutational analysis of position 66 in the OmcB proteins from <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> L1 and E identified this position as being crucial for binding of heparin-like GAG structures. We found that the ability of <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> L1 OmcB to bind heparin-like GAGs is completely abrogated by changing the proline residue at position 66 to a lysine. Similarly, adhesion of <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> E OmcB to HEp-2 cells, which is normally completely independent of heparin-like GAGs, can be strongly reduced by prior incubation of the <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> E L<sub>66</sub>P variant with heparin. These findings support and extend the results of other studies which have shown that <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> LGV infections can be blocked by addition of heparin, while infection by serovar E is less susceptible to interference by heparan sulphate or other GAGs tested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Davis and Wyrick, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b71">Taraktchoglou <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Beswick <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>). It has been reported that attachment of EBs from <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> trachoma biovar strains B and C to HeLa 229 cells is also only partially inhibited by exogenous heparin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Chen and Stephens, 1997</xref>). The OmcB protein sequences of the three trachoma serovars (serovars B, C, E) are identical in the N-terminal basic domain except for the leucine at position 66 which is only found in serovar E. Thus the <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> E L66P variant generated in this work mimics the partial heparin resistance of serovars B and C. The question remains why serovar E is the only trachoma biovar identified thus far, which has evolved the particular OmcB protein exhibiting adhesion to human epithelial cells independent of heparin-like GAGs. The OmcB protein sequences from other chlamydia differ significantly in the N-terminal basic domain from the trachoma biovars, and it is therefore difficult to assess the impact of this particular alteration at position 66 based on sequence comparisons alone. Functional differences in heparin-binding proteins between related species are also observed in other organisms. The <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> adhesin heparin-binding haemagglutinin (HBHA) binds via its C-terminal lysine-rich domain to heparin and is relevant for binding to non-professional phagocytes. The corresponding protein from <italic>Mycobacterium smegmatis</italic> shares 68% identity with its homologue and is associated with the cell wall, but exhibits low affinity for heparin, probably due to a stretch of acidic residues preceding the basic domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Biet <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007</xref>).</p><p>Why do the OmcB proteins from <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> serovars L1 and E exhibit different GAG dependencies? Serovar E is thought to be a non-disseminating luminal pathogen, entering and exiting the apical surfaces of columnar epithelial cells lining the mucosa, and ascending via canaliculi in the female genital tract. In contrast, serovar L1 is a disseminating pathogen, exiting the basal surfaces of epithelial cells and then spreading through the submucosa to lymph nodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Davis and Wyrick, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Davis <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>). Despite these large differences in disease pattern, the genomes of the different <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> serovars share more than 99% identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Dean <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>), suggesting that small changes in individual genes may have profound effects on the type of disease caused. Our findings are compatible with the idea that the two <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> serovars have evolved specific OmcB adhesins for different niches. It has been demonstrated that heparan sulphate is only localized to the basal membrane of genital columnar epithelial cells of mouse tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Hayashi <italic>et al.</italic>, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Bernfield <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>). Thus, <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> serovar E will only be able to adhere to and invade the apical cell side by exploiting a different, non-heparin-like structure, and this might occur via a modified OmcB basic region. It has been suggested that in the <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> strains the <italic>omcB</italic> gene has diverged more rapidly than the <italic>ompA</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">Millman <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>). This might suggest that selection pressure acted to diversify the N-terminal region of the OmcB protein in order to optimize infection of specific cell types. In contrast, the rest of the OmcB protein, which is probably responsible for the rigid cell wall structure of the EBs and for stabilization of the RB outer membrane during the replicative phase, might face strong stabilizing selection pressure and thus undergoes little change.</p></sec><sec><title>The role of OmcB in chlamydial infection</title><p>Glycosaminoglycans have been implicated in cell attachment and invasion by chlamydia species. Here we show that OmcB from <italic>C. pneumoniae</italic> binds to heparin-like GAG structures on human cells and probably is necessary for chlamydial infections. However, the precise chemical nature of the heparin-like structure recognized by OmcB remains to be analysed. Originally we had shown that <italic>C. pneumoniae</italic> strain GiD adheres to heparin-like GAGs on the HEp-2 cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b78">Wuppermann <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>). New data indicate that other <italic>C. pneumoniae</italic> strains and epithelial cell lines as well as endothelial cells exhibit differences in GAG dependency, and evidence for a role of GAGs located on the host cell surface and on the surface of the infectious EB has been presented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Beswick <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b80">Yan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Moreover, the infectivity of <italic>C. pneumoniae</italic> strains could also be inhibited by chondroitin sulphate, although heparin treatment was more effective. Taken together, these data suggest that the GAG-binding proteins on the cell surface of different <italic>C. pneumoniae</italic> strains might be variable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Beswick <italic>et al.</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b80">Yan <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Alternatively, other EB surface proteins may modulate the OmcB specificity for certain GAGs or additional unknown GAG-binding proteins may be present on the EB surface.</p><p>We propose that the attachment of <italic>C. pneumoniae</italic> to human cells via OmcB&#x02013;GAG interactions is only the first step towards successful internalization. Blocking this initial interaction between the EB and the target cell by the addition of excess amounts of soluble heparan sulphate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b78">Wuppermann <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001</xref>) or recombinant OmcB or OmcB antibody (this work) always results in a residual infectivity of about 10%. This points to the presence of additional, as yet unidentified adhesin&#x02013;receptor interactions which, in combination with the OmcB&#x02013;GAG interaction, might account in part for tissue tropism and the spread of the pathogen.</p><p>The simplest infection model would postulate that OmcB molecules present on the surface of <italic>C. pneumoniae</italic> EBs bind GAG structures located on the host cell surface in order to initiate attachment. However, at present it cannot be excluded that this bimolecular interaction is accompanied by a trimolecular interaction, in which OmcB located on the EB surface binds specific soluble (pathogen- or host cell-derived) GAGs or GAG-like structures, which in turn are recognized by cellular receptors. This latter mechanism has been proposed for <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> by Stephens <italic>et al.</italic> who have shown that the serovars L2 and D seem not to bind directly to heparan sulphate on the host cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b84">Zhang and Stephens, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b67">Stephens <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Such a trimolecular model has also been proposed for a number of other bacteria, which may utilize specific GAGs as molecular bridges to interact with a diverse array of mammalian heparin-binding proteins (MHBPs) in order to optimize pathogen&#x02013;host interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Duensing <italic>et al.</italic>, 1999</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Experimental procedures</title><sec><title>Bacterial strains, yeast strains and cell culture</title><p><italic>Escherichia coli</italic> strain XL-1 blue (Stratagene) was used for protein expression and plasmid amplification. <italic>C. pneumoniae</italic> GiD, <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> serovars LGV (L1/440/Bu; ATCC No. VR-902B) and E (DK-20; Institute of Ophthalmology, London) were propagated in HEp-2 cells (ATCC No. CCL-23) as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">Roblin <italic>et al.</italic>, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Jantos <italic>et al.</italic>, 1997</xref>).
