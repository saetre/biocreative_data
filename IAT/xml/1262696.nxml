GTPases are the oldest enzymes that use nucleotides as substrates and they participate in a wide range of cellular processes. Therefore, they are ideal tools for comparative genomic studies aimed at understanding how aspects of biological complexity such as cellular compartmentalization evolved.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We describe the identification and characterization of a unique family of circularly permuted GTPases represented by the human orthologue of yeast Lsg1p. We placed the members of this family in the phylogenetic context of the <bold>Y</bold>lqF <bold>R</bold>elated <bold>G</bold>TPase (YRG) family, which are present in Eukarya, Bacteria and Archea and include the stem cell regulator Nucleostemin. To extend the computational analysis, we showed that hLsg1 is an essential GTPase predominantly located in the endoplasmic reticulum and, in some cells, in Cajal bodies in the nucleus. Comparison of localization and siRNA datasets suggests that all members of the family are essential GTPases that have increased in number as the compartmentalization of the eukaryotic cell and the ribosome biogenesis pathway have evolved.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We propose a scenario, consistent with our data, for the evolution of this family: cytoplasmic components were first acquired, followed by nuclear components, and finally the mitochondrial and chloroplast elements were derived from different bacterial species, in parallel with the formation of the nucleolus and the specialization of nuclear components.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Comparative genomics is a powerful method for identifying the potential functions of previously uncharacterized genes, allowing their distribution among the kingdoms of life to be characterized, and the changes in sequence and regulation underpinning their conserved or divergent functions to be tracked [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Comparative genomics has been enormously facilitated by progress in bioinformatics tools, comprising the enormous amount of information available from databases concerning protein localization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], viability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], protein expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], genetic interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and protein-protein interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. These resources are usually focused on one particular organism (<italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, <italic>C. elegans</italic>, <italic>D. melanogaster </italic>or <italic>B. subtilis</italic>) and are therefore mainly used by the small part of the scientific community working with this organism and able to handle the outcome and limitations. Attempts have been made to correlate large datasets across species, for example in the case of protein-protein interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. These cross-correlation analyses are based on the presumption that sequence and structural similarities between gene products can be used to assess functional similarities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and could in principle be extended to protein localization, viability or partners.</p><p>Genomics should be particularly powerful in the case of GTP binding proteins (or GTPases), which despite extraordinary functional diversity are all believed to have evolved from a single common ancestor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. As a result, all known GTPases have a conserved switch mechanism of action, core structure and sequence motifs. These proteins are found in all domains of life and are involved in such essential processes as vesicular trafficking, protein translation, intracellular signal transduction and cell cycle progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. GTP binding proteins are often described as molecular switch proteins because of their particular mode of action. Binding and hydrolysis of GTP results in conformational changes in the so-called switch regions of the protein, which define the active GTP- and the inactive GDP-bound forms; these are used, for instance, for regulating receptor activation and cargo recruitment to membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>We have used comparative genomics to identify and characterize the human homologue of the yeast protein Lsg1. Here, we describe a novel family of GTP binding proteins, which we have named YRG (YlqF Related GTPases). Members of this family contain a central GTPase domain showing a unique circular permutation of the known G motifs of the GTP binding proteins. A phylogenetic analysis was used for cross-species comparisons, focusing on sub-cellular localization, cell viability and the known functions of each subfamily member. This analysis showed that YRG family members are essential, have increased in eukaryotes as cell compartmentalizationhas evolved, and show functional conservation in relation to rRNA maturation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Recently, we have localized more than 800 human proteins in living cells with the aim of gaining preliminary functional data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Analysis of these proteins for sequences exhibiting characteristic GTPase motifs such as the P-loop [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] allowed us to identify a subset of proteins as putative GTPases.</p><sec><title>Human Lsg1p defines a highly conserved GTPase protein family</title><p>One of these proteins possesses a central GTPase domain defined in the PFAM database of protein domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] as the MMR/HSR1 domain, a coiled coil, and a potential nuclear localization signal (NLS) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). No additional structural or enzymatic domains could be identified in the protein sequence using the SMART domain research server [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Interestingly, this GTPase domain is circularly permuted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], in contrast to the canonical organization of GTPases based on the small GTPase Ras [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. This circular permutation is unique, and it is surprising in view of the structure of the GTPase P-loop domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. It implies that the four highly conserved elements of the GTPase that mediate interactions with the guanine nucleotides and effector proteins, known as the G1, G2, G3 and G4 motifs, are circularly permuted and reorganized, since G4 is followed by G1, G2 and G3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>hLsg1 is member of a large circularly permuted GTPase family. </bold>(A) <bold>Schematic representation of hLsg1 </bold>&#x02013; hLsg1 encodes a protein of 658 amino acids comprising a central MMR/HSR1 GTPase domain (black box, 151&#x02013;500), a coiled-coil domain (Hatched box, 126&#x02013;151) and a nuclear localization signal (NLS, grey box, 638&#x02013;654).

The alignment was produced using ClustalW followed by manual editing [16]. The tree was generated from the alignment using MrBayes v3 [45] (100000 generations with parameter n chains = 4; convergence occurred after 33600 generations; the tree is the consensus of 664 trees computed using MrBayes. No molecular clock was assumed and therefore the branch lengths have no meaning. The numbers indicate the fraction of trees displaying the grouping given by the branch). The root of the tree is the one given by the MrBayes output.

Only one member of the family has so far been experimentally defined, namely the Lsg1 protein in <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Accordingly, we named the human protein hLsg1 (<bold><underline>h</underline></bold>uman orthologue of <bold><underline>Lsg1</underline></bold>). All orthologues of hLsg1 possess a central MMR/HSR1 domain belonging to KOG1424 in the database of clusters of orthologous genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. The identity between aligned sequences ranges from 31% to 88%. Interestingly, except in the <italic>E. cuniculi </italic>member, the GTPase domain contains an unusual insertion in comparison to the canonical GTPase structure. This insertion separates the G4 element from the remaining GTPase elements (G1, G2 and G3) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>).</p><p>In order to elucidate the potential function of hLsg1, we extended our phylogenetic analysis. Owing to their unique structure, circularly permuted GTPases have previously been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] and partially grouped into the Yawg/YlqF family (COG1160) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], which is mainly restricted to prokaryotes and microbial eukaryotes (<italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, <italic>E. cuniculi</italic>). This family contains five subfamilies: YjeQ (YloQ), MJ1464, YqeH, YlqF and Yawg. The latter three branches have eukaryotic members, YlqF representing the ancestor of hLsg1. Interestingly, while the YqeH subfamily is limited to only one member per species (also labeled as Euk-porin in sequence database), and the YjeQ subfamily is mainly restricted to bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], the YlqF subfamily shows a large expansion of this gene family in eukarya (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). The YlqF subfamily can be further subdivided into five clades: YlqF (bacterial), MTG1 (KOG2485), LSG1 (KOG1424), NOG2 (Yawg, KOG2423), and NUG1 (KOG2484) according to the <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>nomenclature. The YlqF family expands further in Coelomates [GNL1, 23] and in Deuterostomia (Nucleostemin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref> [see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">Additional file 2</xref>]).</p><p>Next, we exploited the experimental data from a comprehensive large-scale localization screen in yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] and we conducted literature searches to deduce the possible cellular localizations of the different family members, ranging from the nucleolus to the mitochondria. The nucleolus is the compartment in which the large ribosomal RNA precursor (pre-rRNA) is synthesized, processed into the mature 18S, 5.8S, and 28S rRNAs and assembled with proteins to form ribosomal subunits that move to the nucleoplasm and are finally exported to the cytoplasm. Mitochondria and chloroplasts also possess a set of ribosomes. All yeast members (LSG1, NOG2, NUG1 and MTG1) are involved in ribosome biogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], and YjeQ binds to the ribosome in <italic>E. coli </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Finally, using ChloroP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] to predict proteins localized to the chloroplast, we detected a sixth subfamily in YlqF, called ChYlqF (for Chloroplast YlqF), and a second subfamily in YqeH, called ChYqeH (for chloroplast YqeH). These are only found in plant genomes and group in the phylogenetic tree with the cyanobacteria YRG and YqeH members (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref> [see Additional files <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>]).</p></sec><sec><title>Nucleotide binding and GTPase activity of hLsg1</title><p>Lsg1-related proteins contain motifs that have been found to be important for guanine nucleotide binding and GTPase activity in a variety of cellular proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Lsg1-related proteins contain the G1-4 motifs typical of GTPases (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>), suggesting that members of this family are likely to exhibit guanine nucleotide binding and GTPase activity. However, direct experimental evidence for this has been lacking so far, except for the distantly related bacterial homologues YjeQ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], YlqF and YqeH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. To test this function in human Lsg1, we examined the binding of [<sup>32</sup>P] GTP to purified His tagged-hLsg1 using as control a His-tagged Sar1p, a well characterized GTPase regulating the vesicular coat complex COPII [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, hLsg1 binds to [<sup>32</sup>P] GTP, although more weakly than Sar1p. However, hLsg1 did not bind GDP under those experimental conditions (data not shown), which may reflect weak binding. To determine the GTPase activity of hLsg1, we performed a GTPase assay using an HPLC system as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. In this assay, purified recombinant hLsg1 showed a low GTPase activity that proceeded to GMP and induced the further hydrolysis of GDP through GMP to guanosine. Such low GTPase activities have previously been observed in the distantly related bacterial homolog YjeQ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], but also in GTPases in general, since their activities rely heavily on co-factors such as GAPs (GTPase Activating Proteins) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] or GEFs (Guanine nucleotide Exchange Factors) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Moreover, other GTPases such as the interferon-induced 67-kDa guanylate-binding protein (hGBP1) have been shown not to limit their hydrolysis to GDP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. To confirm our observations indicating that hLsg1 has GTPase activity, we immunoprecipitated endogenous hLsg1 from a HeLa cell extract using a polyclonal antibody raised against purified hLsg1, and analyzed the GTPase activity of the precipitate (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). The GTPase activity was four times higher (incubation time 4 h compared to 18 h required for completion of GTP hydrolysis) than that of <italic>in vitro </italic>purified recombinant hLsg1 and GDP was the only final product (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, lower panel). These data demonstrate GTPase activity in a eukaryotic member of the YlqF family for the first time.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Nucleotide binding and GTPase activity of hLsg1. </bold>(A) <bold>GTP binding of hLsg1. </bold>Nucleotide binding was measured as described in Materials and Methods.

To confirm the consequences of loss of hLsg1, we transfected siRNAs targeted against hLsg1 into HeLa cells, confirming the efficiency of the siRNA treatment by western blot analysis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). After 24 h, Lsg1 expression showed a drastic decrease in cells treated with Lsg1 siRNA compared to cells treated with a negative control siRNA. Moreover, hLsg1 expression in control cells or cells transfected with the negative control shows a band shift that increases with time, as observed in proteins post-translationally modified e.g. by phosphorylation. The increase in intensity could indicate that the polyclonal antibody has a higher affinity for the modified form. There was no significant change in actin expression in control cells, or in cells treated with either random siRNA or a specific hLsg1 siRNA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). However, microscopic observations during the course of the experiment showed that HeLa cell cultures exhibiting hLsg1 knockdown were less dense than control cells. In addition, hLsg1 knockdowns contained more apoptotic cells (not shown), suggesting a lethal effect. We confirmed this by immunostaining hLsg1-specific siRNA-treated cells with a polyclonal anti-hLsg1 antibody and staining the cell nuclei with DAPI at different times after transfection of the siRNA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>).

Cellular localization is a key to defining protein function. Using large-scale localization screens, we previously identified hLsg1 as an endoplasmic reticulum localized protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], in contrast to yeast Lsg1, which is proposed to localize specifically to the cytosol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>We decided to confirm our preliminary data on hLsg1 localization in humans using GFP-fused constructs as well as specific polyclonal antibodies. When expressed as a C-terminally tagged YFP fusion protein, hLsg1 localized to the ER in most cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). In 10% of the transfected cells, however, discrete structures in the nucleus were observed and localization to the endoplasmic reticulum was decreased or even absent (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). An N-terminally tagged CFP-hLsg1 fusion protein was also localized to the ER and nuclear envelope, but more of the protein was cytosolic than in the case of the C-terminal hLsg1-YFP fusion (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). A truncated hLsg1 version (480 to 658aa) fused to the YFP, containing the potential NLS, accumulated in the nucleus and nucleolus (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Collectively, these data indicate that the NLS present in the C-terminus of hLsg1 is functional, in contrast to the putative NLS in yeast Lsg1, which is reportedly restricted to the cytosol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Subcellular localization analysis of hLsg1. </bold>(A) <bold>Subcellular localization of YFP and CFP tagged hLsg1 </bold>&#x02013; HeLa cells were transiently transfected with hLsg1-YFP (1, 2), or CFP-hLsg1 (3) and visualized by fluorescence microscopy.

The YlqF protein family represents the largest subfamily of YRG expansion in eukarya, which is potentially involved in ribosome biogenesis.</p><p>Phylogenetic analysis defines ten GTPase subfamilies with a global phyletic distribution compatible with their presence in the last universal common ancestor (LUCA) of extant life forms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. An emerging concept suggests that these universal GTPases are necessary either for ribosome function or for transmitting information from the ribosome to downstream targets to generate specific cellular responses. These are associated with translation and include four translation factors, two OBG-like GTPases, the two signal-recognition-associated GTPases, the MRP subfamily of MinD-like ATPases and the YRG family. Here we have defined the YRG family for the first time as a eukaryotic expansion of the original Yawg/YlqF family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] tightly coupled to the evolution of compartmentalization.</p><p>The YRG family was originally defined as a particular class of GTPases showing a circularly permuted structure, with the four GTPase motifs reorganized as G4 followed by G1, G2 and G3 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). This circular permutation is unique in the GTPase superfamily. However, we have shown that this inverted structure does not seem to affect GTPase activity or folding, in agreement with other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Moreover, regarding the potential function of this family, it has been pointed out that most YRG members bind to the ribosome [YjeQ, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]], are involved in the maturation of ribosomes or mitoribosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], localize to compartments related to rRNA maturation [NGP, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]], and are essential proteins (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref> and Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). Altogether, this indicates that YRG members have an essential role in ribosomal assembly.</p><p>Strikingly, we could find a member of the YRG family for every cellular compartment linked to ribosomes, including the chloroplast (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>), correlating with the expansion of the eukaryotic cell (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). According to the phylogenetic tree of the family, the cytosolic form block (LSG1) is distinct from the nuclear form blocks (NOG2, NGP1, YawG), which later expanded into a nucleolar form (NUG1), in parallel with the incorporation of members upon engulfment of the future mitochondria (MTG1) that cluster within the YlqF branch as well as the future chloroplast (ChYlqF). Other events within the YlqF family included the appearance of a second cytosolic form upon speciation of the coelomates (GNL1), which may have had an equivalent in the plant lineage, since we observed a form of Lsg1 in <italic>A. thaliana </italic>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Moreover, we observed the appearance of a second nucleolar form (Nucleostemin) upon speciation of the deuterostomes. Since Nucleostemin is involved in cell-cycle regulation in stem cells, we can hypothesize a direct mechanism of rRNA maturation in those highly specialized animal cells. We propose the following scenario for the evolution of the YRG family. First, a cytosolic founding member was duplicated upon the formation of a proto-nucleus, allowing the rRNA maturation pathway to be maintained (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). The second step included the engulfment of mitochondria and chloroplasts containing specific YRG forms involved in rRNA maturation in these compartments. The final step(s) involved the evolution of the cytosolic and nuclear members upon the specialization of the eukaryotic cell (nucleolus etc). This scenario accords with the work of Mans et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>], which showed by comparative genomics that a large set of proteins was involved in the formation and structure of the nuclear envelope and the pore complex: the nucleus evolved from a primordial prekaryote compartment and a primitive nuclear pore complex dependent on Ran and on Nug1p/Nug2p, a nucleolar YRG member.</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>The YRG family expands in relation to compartmentalization. </bold>Scenario of the evolution of compartmentalization of the YRG members based on the phylogenetic tree in Figure 1.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1741-7007-3-21-6"/></fig><p>Interestingly, hLsg1 is the only member of this family that shows a dual localization (cytosol/endoplasmic reticulum and Cajal Bodies). The cytosol contains huge numbers of ribosomes freely diffusing or bound to the endoplasmic reticulum, and is the main transit pathway for rRNA <italic>en route </italic>to the mitochondria or the chloroplast. Cajal Bodies are spherical nuclear bodies containing a variety of components including nucleolar proteins, snRNPs and SMN. They are dynamic structures functionally linked to the nucleolus, presumably involved in RNP maturation and related to gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Consistent with these data, one could hypothesize that hLsg1 is a regulator of the rRNA pathway that can relocate to Cajal Bodies and interact with specific factors such as nucleolar proteins. The observation that Leptomycin B treatment leads to accumulation of hLsg1 in the nucleus clearly indicates shuttling via a CRM1-dependent export pathway. We hypothesized that hLsg1 relocalizes from the cytosol to the nucleus in response to internal (e.g. cell cycle) or external (e.g. growth factor) stimuli. In this way, hLsg1 would act on the control of rRNA biosynthesis at its source: the nucleolus. In the future, these hypotheses will be tested for hLsg1 and for the other YRG family members to elucidate their role in rRNA biosynthesis and maturation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Using comparative genomics, we defined the YRG family as a unique group of circularly permuted GTPases. We suggest a potential function for this family, as well as a potential pathway by which the family members may act sequentially, following an evolutionary process linked to compartimentalization (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). A future goal will be to test this hypothesis experimentally and to dissect the molecular mechanisms of action of each member of the pathway.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Analysis of Lsg1p protein family</title><sec><title>Database similarity searches</title><p>The translated sequence of the <italic>Homo sapiens </italic>gene FLJ11301 (GenBank accession no. <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="NP_060855">NP_060855</ext-link>) was used to search the non-redundant protein database at the National Center for Biotechnology Information using the PSI-BLASTP program (15).

Progressively larger multiple sequence alignments were built by constructing multiple sequence alignments of each subfamily, which were manually polished and added together stepwise. At each step, the parts outside the central GTPase domain, which often showed no homology across subfamilies (and therefore should not be aligned), were trimmed to facilitate the production of the next multiple sequence alignment.
