Two mechanisms negatively regulate separase: inhibition by securin and phosphorylation on serine 1121. To gauge the physiological significance of the inhibitory phosphorylation, we created a mouse strain in which Ser1121 was mutated to Ala (S1121A). Here we report that this S1121A point mutation causes infertility in mice. We show that germ cells in the mutants are depleted during development. We further demonstrate that S1121A causes chromosome misalignment during proliferation of the postmigratory primordial germ cells, resulting in mitotic arrest, aneuploidy, and eventual cell death. Our results indicate that inhibitory phosphorylation of separase plays a critical role in the maintenance of sister chromatid cohesion and genome stability in proliferating postmigratory primordial germ cells.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title> Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>Higher eukaryotes rely on a separate cell lineage, the germline, to pass genetic information from generation to generation. To ensure faithful transmission of genetic information, cell cycle checkpoint mechanisms are engaged during mitotic and meiotic divisions of germ cells. The identity and function of these checkpoints is not well understood. In mammals, the germline is specified early in embryogenesis as primordial germ cells (PGCs) at the epiblast stage (around embryonic day 5.0 in mice). PGCs then migrate out from their birthplace and arrive at the genital ridge several days later. In the genital ridge, PGCs undergo a great expansion in number through mitosis. During this expansion, PGCs critically depend on the inhibitory phosphorylation of separase to prevent premature separation of sister chromatids and hence progeny with abnormal chromosome number. Separase is a protease which cleaves the Scc1 subunit of sister chromatid cohesin complex. Its activity must be suppressed before all sisters are aligned at the metaphase plate. Two mechanisms are known that can inhibit separase: phosphorylation and binding by securin, both of which are activated at the spindle assembly checkpoint. Although these two mechanisms are redundant in somatic cells, our results indicate that the inhibitory phosphorylation of separase is uniquely required in the germline.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>A single point mutation of separase that blocks its phosphorylation has a profound and dominant effect on germ cell biology.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Huang X, Andreu-Vieyra CV, York JP, Hatcher R, Lu T (2008) Inhibitory phosphorylation of separase is essential for genome stability and viability of murine embryonic germ cells.

However, we do not know whether these two separase-regulating mechanisms are redundant at the level of the organism or if the inhibitory phosphorylation of separase plays any role in development.</p><p>Infertility in humans has a strong genetic contribution.

Chromosome abnormalities or aneuploidy in germ cells are often cited as the cause for failed conceptions. Aneuploidy can result from errors in mitosis or meiosis of germ cells. Yet, we know little about the molecular mechanisms that ensure genome stability in germ cells, during their development, and in meiosis. In this study, we report the analysis of mice carrying a nonphosphorylable <italic>separase</italic> allele.

Because phosphorylation of Ser1121 contributes the most to separase inhibition &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060015-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;, we reasoned that mutating this serine residue to alanine would destroy this separase-inhibiting mechanism.

One prediction of this hypothesis is that mutants would have more PGCs in mitosis than controls due to spindle checkpoint-mediated mitotic arrest.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060015-g003">Figure 3</xref>A, the mitotic indices of mutant PGCs were slightly higher than controls at 11.5 dpc and were significantly higher than controls at 12.5, 13.5, and 14.5 dpc, whereas the mitotic indices of non&#x02013;germ cells were the same between the control and the mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060015-g003">Figure 3</xref>B). We also measured the expression levels of phospho-histone H3 and cyclin B1 in 13.5 dpc genital ridges by western blotting. Again, these two mitotic markers were expressed at higher levels in the mutant than in the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060015-g003">Figure 3</xref>C). Furthermore, we observed that the majority of mutant mitotic figures were abnormal and showed misaligned chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060015-g003">Figure 3</xref>D), suggesting premature separation of sister chromatids. To visualize precocious sister separation, we cultured PGCs isolated from 11.5 dpc genital ridges and treated the cells with nocodazole for 6 h to enrich mitotic cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060015-g003">Figure 3</xref>E, the mutant PGCs showed complete separation of sister chromatids while the control did not, indicating that inhibitory phosphorylation of separase is essential in maintaining sister chromatid cohesion in PGCs.

When the DNA content of the germ and non&#x02013;germ cells was determined through laser scanning cytometry and averaged without grouping the cells into G1, S, or G2/M phases, we found that control and mutant non&#x02013;germ cells contained the same amount of DNA with similar statistical distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060015-g004">Figure 4</xref>C). By contrast, germ cells in controls contained higher levels of DNA compared with somatic cells, suggesting that cell cycle profiles differ between germ cells and somatic cells and that more germ cells than somatic cells are in G2/M phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060015-g004">Figure 4</xref>C). Consistent with this result, the mitotic indices of germ cells were 2-fold higher than those of somatic cells from 11.5 to 13.5 dpc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060015-g004">Figure 4</xref>D). In contrast, germ cell DNA content in mutants was much higher compared with controls and was greater than twice the amount in somatic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060015-g004">Figure 4</xref>C). Given that the difference in cell cycle profiles between somatic cells and germ cells, the average DNA content of somatic cells can be considered as 2N. It follows then that the DNA content in mutant germ cells is greater than 4N, suggesting that some mutant germ cells might have undergone or initiated another round of DNA synthesis as tetraploid cells.

In normal mitosis, Aurora B first associates with the metaphase chromosomes, departs the chromosomes and translocates to the cleavage furrow at anaphase, becomes concentrated in the mid-body during cytokinesis, and finally disappears in G1. When we immunostained with antibodies against Aurora B, we found that this mitotic kinase formed foci in all mutant PGCs with abnormal nuclear morphologies, although the cells were no longer in mitosis as their chromosomes had already decondensed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060015-g005">Figure 5</xref>A).

What makes the germline particularly vulnerable to this phosphorylation point mutation in <italic>separase</italic>?

Once arrived at the genital ridge, PGCs may shut off the expression of <italic>securin</italic> along with the entire migratory program, making the postmigratory germ cells vulnerable to nonphosphorylatable separase.
