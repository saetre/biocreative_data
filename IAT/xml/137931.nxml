A functional polymorphic variant (C&#x02192;T substitution at nucleotide 677) in the 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (<italic>MTHFR</italic>) gene results in the conversion of an alanine to a valine and may modify the risk of breast and other cancers.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Method</title><p>We have investigated the possible influence of this <italic>MTHFR</italic> variant on breast cancer risk in a case-control study of 233 healthy women and 335 women who had breast cancer that occurred under the age of 40 years, bilateral breast cancer or a family history of breast cancer.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A significant excess of the valine genotypes was observed among the cases (odds ratio 1.43, 95% confidence interval 1.02&#x02013;2.00).

Approximately 10% of Caucasian populations are homozygous for a common C&#x02192;T substitution at nucleotide 677 of the <italic>MTHFR</italic> gene. This mutation converts an alanine to a valine at codon 225 and is associated with reduced enzyme activity and increased thermolability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The potential influence of MTHFR activity on DNA methylation and on the availability of uridylates and thymidylates for DNA synthesis and repair makes <italic>MTHFR</italic> an attractive candidate for a cancer predisposing gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Deficiencies in thymidylate have been shown to increase the rate of misincorporation of uridylate into DNA and may in turn lead to an increased rate of DNA strand breaks and other chromosomal damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Consequently, reduced MTHFR activity, which leads to increased levels of cytosolic 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate available for thymidylate synthesis, may protect cells from DNA damage induced by uridylate misincorporation. Consistent with this model, several independent studies have shown that the mutant (valine) allele of <italic>MTHFR</italic> may confer a twofold reduction in risk of colon cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] and a fourfold reduction in risk of acute lymphocytic leukemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Mutant <italic>MTHFR</italic> has also been associated with a 2.8-fold increase in risk of endometrial cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and a 2.9-fold increase in risk of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In the latter situation the increased cancer risk associated with mutant <italic>MTHFR</italic> might be explained by impairment of DNA methylation due to a reduction in the availability of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate. This is a plausible model because DNA methylation plays a critical role in regulation of gene expression and maintenance of genomic stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and aberrations in normal methylation patterns have been associated with the development of cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. More recently, Stern <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] demonstrated that individuals who are homozygous for the mutant C677T <italic>MTHFR</italic> polymorphism show a higher degree of genomic DNA hypomethylation than do homozygotes for the wild-type <italic>MTHFR.</italic></p><p>The role of folate in breast cancer has been investigated in several dietary studies and most have shown folate consumption to be inversely related to breast cancer risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. By contrast, few studies have investigated the influence of the <italic>MTHFR</italic> C677T polymorphism on breast cancer risk. In one study the frequency of the low MTHFR activity valine allele was reported to occur significantly more frequently in Jewish women diagnosed with bilateral breast cancer or combined breast and ovarian cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Another study of unselected breast cancer cases among a Scottish population did not detect any association with the C677T polymorphism and breast cancer risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], although the study involved only 62 cases and 66 controls and lacked statistical power.</p><p>Given the plausible role of variations in MTHFR activity in breast cancer susceptibility we undertook an analysis of the C677T polymorphism in a case-control study of 335 women with breast cancer and 233 controls.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>Women with breast cancer were selected on the basis of an age at onset of less than 40 years, or a family history of breast cancer (defined as two or more cases of breast cancer in a first- or second-degree female relative) irrespective of age at onset, or bilateral breast cancer irrespective of family history or age at onset. All breast cancer cohort cases were systematically ascertained through breast clinics in the Wessex region of southern England as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Briefly, women were invited to take part in a research study, the primary goal of which was to ascertain and verify family histories for segregation analysis. The breast cancer cases diagnosed before 40 years of age were consecutively ascertained without regard to family history. The group of women with bilateral breast cancer were ascertained in the same clinics but the selection criterion was the presence of bilateral breast cancer diagnosed after 40 years of age. The familial breast cancer cases consisted of women presenting to the same clinics with a strong family history of breast or ovarian cancer or both. Family histories were verified as far as possible using medical records and death certificates. Blood was taken from all recruits who consented to molecular analysis for breast cancer predisposition genes. The age range of the women included in the breast cancer cohort was 19&#x02013;79 with a mean age of 38 years. The controls represent the population from which the cases arose and consisted of 233 Caucasian female volunteers who were either staff at the Princess Anne Hospital, Southampton, UK or patients attending for non-neoplastic disease conditions. The age of the controls ranged from 18 to 84 with a mean age of 39 years. For all groups normal genomic DNA was prepared from blood lymphocytes. Epidemiological data such as reproductive factors, oral contraceptive use, smoking habits and obesity were not obtained for either the cases or controls. Both control and cancer groups were drawn from the same geographical area, which has predominantly an Anglo-Saxon population.</p></sec><sec><title>MTHFR genotyping</title><p>Genomic DNA from cases and controls was assessed for the presence of the C677T mutation by PCR amplification using an exonic primer (5'-tgaaggagaaggtgtctgcggga-3') and an intronic primer (5'-aggacggtgcggtgagagtg-3') as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. PCRs were performed in a reaction volume of 10 &#x003bc;l containing 50 ng of genomic DNA, primers (25 ng of each), 1 &#x000d7; reaction buffer (Genepak, New Milton, UK), 200 nM of dATP, dTTP, dGTP, dCTP (Promega, Annandale, Australia) and 0.2 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Taq Express, Genepak, UK). PCR conditions consisted of an initial denaturation at 94&#x000b0;C for 5 minutes followed by 35 cycles of 94&#x000b0;C for 30 s, 55&#x000b0;C for 30 s, 72&#x000b0;C for 60 s followed by one cycle of 72&#x000b0;C for 5 min. The PCR products were digested with <italic>Hin</italic>fI in a volume of 20 &#x003bc;l and the fragments were separated on 2.0% agarose gels and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. The C&#x02192;T (valine) variant creates a <italic>Hin</italic>fI restriction enzyme site and produces fragments of 178 basepairs (bp) and 23 bp.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Frequency comparisons were analysed using Fisher's exact test. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using the relevant 2 &#x000d7; 2 contingency tables. All statistical calculations were two-sided and performed using InStat version 3.01 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). All statistical tests were based on two-tailed probability.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> shows the distribution of the C677T polymorphism among the 335 women in the breast cancer cohort and 233 controls. The distribution of the alleles among the controls is consistent with that for previously reported control populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. We did not observe a departure from Hardy&#x02013;Weinberg equilibrium in the breast cancer or the control groups (<italic>P</italic> = 0.62 and <italic>P</italic> = 0.37, respectively).</p><p>The frequency of the valine allele among the breast cancer cohort was 0.34, which was higher than that of the controls (0.30), but this was not statistically significant (<italic>P</italic> = 0.30). The combined number of valine/valine homozygotes and alanine/valine heterozygotes was significantly higher among the breast cancer cases as a whole than among the controls (OR 1.43, 95% CI 1.02&#x02013;2.00). The significant excess of valine genotypes was only observed among the breast cancer cases diagnosed under the age of 40 years (OR 1.64, 95% CI 1.12&#x02013;2.41). Interestingly, the valine heterozygotes had a significantly increased OR (OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.2&#x02013;2.6) while the homozygotes did not (OR 1.4, 95% CI 0.7&#x02013;2.7). This may be due to the effect of the small number of valine homozygotes.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The potential influence of MTHFR activity on DNA methylation and on the availability of uridylates and thymidylates for DNA synthesis and repair makes <italic>MTHFR</italic> an attractive candidate cancer-predisposing gene. Reduced MTHFR activity leads to increased levels of cytosolic 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate, which may protect cells from DNA damage induced by uridylate misincorporation. Indeed, several independent studies have shown that the mutant valine allele of <italic>MTHFR</italic> may reduce the risk of colon cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] and acute lymphocytic leukemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Conversely, mutant <italic>MTHFR</italic> has also been associated with an increase in risk of endometrial cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. An increased cancer risk conferred by the valine allele may be explained by impairment of DNA methylation due to a reduction in the availability of 5-methyltetrahydrofolate.</p><p>Only two previous studies have examined the relationship between the MTHFR C677T polymorphism and breast cancer risk. Gershoni-Baruch <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] reported that the 677T allele occurred significantly more frequently in Jewish women diagnosed with bilateral breast cancer or combined breast and ovarian cancer. Sharp <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] did not observe any significant difference in the genotype distributions within a case-control study of unselected breast cancers from a Scottish population. Comparison of the number of cases that were compound homozygotes of the low-activity 677TT genotype and/or another low-activity <italic>MTHFR</italic> variant (1298 CC) revealed a significant reduction in risk (OR 0.26), suggesting that low MTHFR activity may protect against breast cancer. While this association is intriguing, the reliability of the conclusion is tempered by the fact that the study included only 62 cases and 66 controls.</p><p>Given the plausible role of variations in MTHFR activity in breast cancer susceptibility and the conflicting conclusions of previous studies we undertook an analysis of the C677T polymorphism in a more substantial number of cancers and controls. Our study revealed a significant excess of valine genotypes among the early onset breast cancers (OR 1.43). In contrast to the study by Gershoni-Baruch <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], we did not observe a significant increase in the valine allele frequency among the women diagnosed with bilateral breast cancer or with a family history of breast cancer (although it was higher than in the controls). The data presented by Sharp <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] suggest that low MTHFR activity is associated with a decrease rather than an increase in breast cancer risk. The reliability of their conclusions, however, is limited by the lack of statistical power. The data from our study of 335 cases suggests that, in fact, low MTHFR activity increases the risk of breast cancer. We recognise that the conflicting conclusions may be attributable to the different characteristics of the breast cancer populations studied. Our study included both familial and early onset breast cancers while those of Sharp <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] were unselected cases and those of Gershoni-Baruch <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] were unselected and familial cases occurring among women of Jewish ancestry.</p><p>In conclusion, we suggest that low MTHFR activity is associated with an increased risk of early onset breast cancer. It is possible, however, that chance or confounding factors such as ethnicity and the influence of known risk factors such as oral contraceptive use may have generated a false positive result. Consequently it will be important to replicate our findings in larger population-based case-control studies. In addition, it will be important for future studies to incorporate detailed dietary information, because deficiencies in MTHFR activity may be compensated for by increased folate intake and therefore may confound interpretation of the genetic data.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>bp = basepairs; CI = confidence interval; MTHFR = 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase; OR = odds
