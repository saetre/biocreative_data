[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]). As matrix degradation is an important step in tumor invasion and metastasis, several, but not all, tumor cells downregulate TFPI-2 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. In this regard, overexpression of TFPI-2 in several tumor cells was shown to inhibit their growth, invasiveness, angiogenic potential and metastatic potential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The mechanism whereby some tumor cells downregulate TFPI-2 synthesis has been primarily attributed to transcriptional silencing through hypermethylation of CpG sites in the TFPI-2 promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], inasmuch as treatment of these tumor cells with a methyltransferase inhibitor, 5'-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, restored TFPI-2 transcription[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In addition, several highly aggressive tumors delete the locus for the TFPI-2 gene in the chromosome 7q region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], resulting in the total loss of TFPI-2 protein expression in these cells. Accordingly, the TFPI-2 gene is becoming increasingly recognized as a tumor suppressor gene, since its down-regulation in several types of cancers allow for enhanced tumor growth and metastasis.</p><p>In view of its apparent role in cancer progression, we initiated a study to quantify TFPI-2 transcript levels in total RNA samples from selected normal human tissue, as well as their corresponding tumor tissue. In the course of these studies, we detected a novel, aberrantly-spliced variant of TFPI-2 mRNA derived from TFPI-2 pre-mRNA splicing at exon/intron boundaries, as well as at new sites within exons and introns. The levels of the aberrantly-spliced variant of TFPI-2 were either very low or undetectable in normal tissue, but markedly upregulated in tumor tissues and several tumor cell lines. These findings provide suggestive evidence for an additional mechanism for tumor cells to down-regulate TFPI-2 expression through aberrant splicing.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Novel TFPI-2 splice variant generated by aberrant splicing</title><p>In preliminary studies designed to assess the levels of TFPI-2 transcripts in various normal and tumor tissues, co-amplification of a lower molecular weight cDNA was observed following RT-PCR of total RNA. The low <italic>M</italic><sub><italic>r </italic></sub>cDNA was faintly visible in normal tissues (lung, colon and liver), but was markedly upregulated in the corresponding tumor tissues. Nucleotide sequence analyses of the low <italic>M</italic><sub><italic>r </italic></sub>cDNA amplified from the total RNA of lung tumor tissue revealed a novel, 289 nucleotide, aberrantly-spliced form of the TFPI-2 transcript designated as asTFPI-2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Subsequent studies revealed that the nucleotide sequence of the low <italic>M</italic><sub><italic>r </italic></sub>cDNA from HepG2 cells was identical to that observed in lung tumor tissue (data not shown). Both 5' and 3' RACE analyses of total RNA derived from several tissues and cell lines tested resulted exclusively in the amplification of the normal TFPI-2 transcript. In these RACE analyses, several attempts were made to identify any 5' and 3'-untranslated regions (UTRs) by varying reaction conditions and using different sets of primers, but each attempt only amplified the 5' and 3' ends of normal TFPI-2 (data not shown). Moreover, the 5' and 3' boundaries of the asTFPI-2 were also assessed by primer walking studies using a series of primer combinations spanning the entire regions of exon I, intron A and the 3' UTR (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Thus, these results indicate that the aberrantly-spliced asTFPI-2 reported here lacks any unique 5' and 3'-UTRs and consists of complete exons II and V, fused with 14 nucleotides derived from exon III, 7 nucleotides derived from exon IV, and 6 nucleotides of intron C (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>A schematic representation of the full-length TFPI-2 gene and a novel TFPI-2 splice variant</bold>.

Semi-quantitative RT-PCR was carried out using common set of primers to amplify TFPI-2 and asTFPI-2 transcripts in a single reaction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). The relative intensity data of each amplicon derived was normalized using the cyclophilin A transcript (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). The quantiscan analysis of each amplicon indicated, on average, that there are ~10 fold more TFPI-2 copies in normal tissue in comparison to tumor tissues, and that TFPI-2 is absent in many tumor cell lines (HepG2, Capan-2 and Colo-205). In contrast, with the exception of the J82 bladder carcinoma cell line, there are 7-fold more copies of the asTFPI-2 splice variant in all tumors compared to their corresponding normal tissues or normal cultured cell lines (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Relative quantitation of human TFPI-2 transcripts in various normal and tumor cells</bold>.

The copy numbers for TFPI-2, asTFPI-2 and cyclophilin A transcripts were derived from standard curves of their respective plasmids. The copy numbers of both TFPI-2 and asTFPI-2 observed were normalized to 10<sup>2 </sup>copy numbers of cyclophilin A in respective samples (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). A strong linear relationship between the C<sub>t </sub>and the log of the number of copies was consistently demonstrated (R<sup>2 </sup>&#x02265; 0.99), and melting curves confirmed the presence of a single amplicon. The data analyses of results from three independent measurements revealed highly variable amounts of TFPI-2 and asTFPI-2 transcripts between normal and tumor cells, but on average, there are 10-fold more TFPI-2 copies in normal tissue compared to tumor tissues, whereas there are 53-fold more copies of asTFPI-2 splice variant in tumor tissue or tumor cell lines compared to normal tissues or cultured cell lines. In general, normal tissues and cell lines contained higher levels of full-length TFPI-2 while tumor tissues and tumor cell lines, with the exception of the bladder carcinoma J82 cell line, contained 4&#x02013;50 fold higher levels of the asTFPI-2 transcripts.

To assess the stability of the full-length TFPI-2 and asTFPI-2 transcripts, the transcription inhibitor actinomycin D was added to HUVEC and Colo-205 cells, and the total RNA was extracted at selected intervals. The copy numbers of the TFPI-2 and asTFPI-2 transcript were measured by real-time RT-PCR in order to compare the rate of mRNA decay in these two cell lines (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). As shown in Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, a half-life value of ~16 h was obtained for asTFPI-2 in a colon carcinoma cell line, in comparison to ~8 h for TFPI-2 mRNA in HUVECs. At this point, the functional significance of these relative values is difficult to interpret, given that they were obtained in different cell lines out of necessity due to the lack of a single cell line that produces each of these transcripts in sufficient quantities. Nonetheless, these findings provide suggestive evidence that the half-life of asTFPI-2 may be significantly longer than TFPI-2 mRNA in cultured cells.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Stability of TFPI-2 and asTFPI-2 transcripts</bold>.

RNA molecular weight markers are indicated on the left.

Accordingly, expression of TFPI-2 immunoreactive protein in lysates of two normal and five cancer cell lines was analyzed by immunoblotting using an anti-TFPI-2 polyclonal antibody raised against recombinant human &#x003b1;-TFPI-2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). As expected, TFPI-2 protein was detected in HUVECs and WI-38 human fibroblast cell lysates, and migrated with the characteristic triplet pattern representing &#x003b1;, &#x003b2; and &#x003b3; differentially glycosylated forms of TFPI-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. However, no immunoreactive protein was observed at the expected <italic>M</italic><sub><italic>r </italic></sub>of ~11 kDa for asTFPI-2 in any of the cell lines examined (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). It is also noteworthy that no immunoreactive protein was observed in J82 cells lysates, despite the relatively high copy numbers of TFPI-2 observed in these cells by quantitative real-time RT-PCR (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). In addition, using primers specific for the 5'-UTR and poly (A)<sup>+ </sup>tail of TFPI-2, a full-length transcript for TFPI-2 was observed in J82 cells (data not shown). Precisely why J82 cells do not synthesize TFPI-2 protein will require additional studies, but it is conceivable that the full-length TFPI-2 transcript in these cells contains one or more mutations that precludes translation.</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>Immunoblot analysis of TFPI-2 expression in normal and tumor cell lines</bold>.

Proteolytic degradation of the extracellular matrix, one of the key events in the process of tumor invasion and metastasis, depends on a delicate balance of matrix-degrading proteinases and their inhibitors. The TFPI-2 transcript is abundant in the full-term placenta, and is also present at various levels in several adult human tissues, such as liver, lung, skeletal muscle, heart, kidney, and pancreas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Conversely, TFPI-2 mRNA levels fall with increasing malignancy in the case of breast, gastric, colon, pancreatic, laryngeal, renal, endometrial, glial and several other human malignant tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>In experiments designed to quantify TFPI-2 transcripts in human normal and corresponding tumor tissues using RT-PCR, we observed two TFPI-2 amplicons, using exon II (sense) and exon V (anti-sense) primers. Nucleotide sequencing analysis of both amplicons revealed that the larger <italic>M</italic><sub><italic>r </italic></sub>amplicon (622 bp) corresponded to the full-length TFPI-2 cDNA, while the smaller <italic>M</italic><sub><italic>r </italic></sub>cDNA (289 bp) was an aberrantly-spliced form of the TFPI-2 transcript, which we have provisionally designated as asTFPI-2. Primer walking with a series of primer combinations spanning the entire regions of exon I, intron A and 3' UTR revealed that the complete asTFPI-2 transcript consisted of exon II and exon V, with three unusual spliced regions of nucleotides from exon III, intron C, and exon IV tandemly interspersed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Analysis of potential consensus splice sites in the TFPI-2 gene (GenBank accession no.<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AF217542">AF217542</ext-link>) utilized for the generation of asTFPI-2 using splice site predictor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] revealed no consensus splice sites for subsequent insertion of the observed nucleotide sequences of exon III, intron C and exon IV between exons II and V (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). It is, therefore, highly likely that asTFPI-2 is an aberrant splice product generated from TFPI-2 pre-mRNA in which the splicing of pre-mRNA is misdirected and does not occur solely at <italic>de facto </italic>splice sites normally used by the major, U2-dependent spliceosome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>In order to assess the relative levels of the TFPI-2 and asTFPI-2 transcripts, we used semi-quantitative RT-PCR and quantitative real-time PCR and observed a dramatic difference in the levels of these two transcripts in normal cells and tumor cells. Quantification of TFPI-2 mRNA and asTFPI-2 levels using real-time PCR was found to be highly reproducible using transcript-specific primers, with low inter-assay variations. By this procedure, normal cells synthesize ~10-fold more wild-type TFPI-2 transcripts than tumor cells, whereas tumor cells synthesized 4&#x02013;50 times more asTFPI-2 than normal cells. Moreover, the proportion of asTFPI-2 to that of wild-type TFPI-2 was 7&#x02013;12-fold higher in tumor cells, while in normal cells, the asTFPI-2 transcript was very low to negligible (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).</p><p>An unusual feature of the asTFPI-2 is its lack of detectable 5' &#x02013; and 3' UTRs. As expected, both 5' and 3'-RACE analyses of total RNA from either normal tissue (placenta) or a tumor sample (lung tumor) resulted in a single amplification product containing the 5'-UTR and 3' &#x02013; poly (A)<sup>+ </sup>tail regions of wild-type TFPI-2 cDNA. However, no additional RACE amplification product(s) with either a 5'-UTR or a 3'-poly (A)<sup>+ </sup>tail was observed in either lung tumor RNA or placental RNA, indicating that the asTFPI-2 transcript lacked these two elements. In addition, application of HUVEC and Colo-205 total RNA samples to oligo-dt columns with subsequent elution of the poly (A)<sup>+ </sup>RNA and RT-PCR analyses of these elutes resulted exclusively in the amplification of the full-length TFPI-2 transcript (data not shown). Thus, either by message enrichment, RACE analyses and primer walking experiments, we conclude that asTFPI-2 does not contain either a 5'-UTR or a 3'-poly (A)<sup>+ </sup>tail. Moreover northern blot analysis of total RNA obtained from Colo-205 cells revealed that only the asTFPI-2 transcript (~300 bp) was observed in these cells, further validating the RT-PCR results (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). In contrast, two high molecular weight transcripts (1.2 kb and 1.8 kb) for full length TFPI-2 were observed in HUVECs, confirming the results of previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>After treating cells with actinomycin D, the TFPI-2 mRNA exhibited a half-life of ~8 h in HUVECs, whereas the asTFPI-<italic>2 </italic>mRNA exhibited a half-life value of ~16 h in Colo-205 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Although it is difficult to directly compare the half-lives of these two transcripts made in normal and transformed cells, the relatively long half-life of the asTFPI-2 transcript is remarkable when one considers that it lacks both a 5'-UTR and 3'-poly (A) tail, two elements that usually offer some protection from exonucleolytic decay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Inasmuch as asTFPI-2 is apparently not translated and exhibits a relatively long half-life, it is tempting to speculate that this splice variant plays some role in tumor homeostasis and studies to address this possibility are ongoing in our laboratory.</p><p>Our results are consistent with several reports on differential alternative splicing between cancer and normal expressed sequence tag libraries where there appears to be a higher proportion of disrupted spliced variants in tumor suppressor genes than in non-cancer-related genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. In this regard, aberrant splicing has been reported for mdm2, TSG101 and FHIT pre-mRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], exclusively in tumors, and the splicing was characterized by either losses of individual exons, or loss of exons with insertions of unknown DNA sequences without regard for proper splice junctions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Increased aberrant splicing also represent an additional mechanism for the reduction of the amount of wild type tumor suppressor mRNA without mutation, as shown for the NF1 gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], or alternative splicing, as shown for a brain-specific exon in <italic>Bin1 </italic>eliminating the activity of the tumor suppressor in melanoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. In addition, several cases of aberrant and alternative splicing of different proteins such as transcription factors, signal transducers and extra-cellular matrix components have been related to tumor cell growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. As a consequence, a number of interventions that either alter or exploit alternative splicing are currently under active investigation for cancer therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Conceivably, detection of asTFPI-2 could find application in tumor diagnosis, or possibly serve as a marker for cancer progression.</p><p>Our laboratory, as well as others, have previously reported that overexpression of candidate tumor suppressor TFPI-2 gene in several highly metastatic tumor cells markedly inhibits their growth and metastasis <italic>in-vivo </italic>by regulating pericellular extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling and angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Conversely, hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes is a major epigenetic change that contributes to tumor progression and is correlated with transcriptional silencing. Hypermethylation of the TFPI-2 gene promoter has been described recently as a possible mechanism for gene silencing in a limited number of tumor cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. However, the prevalence of hypermethylation of the TFPI-2 promoter in primary tumors has not been systematically investigated. In many cancer cells, the hypermethylation of the TFPI-2 promoter does not appear to be the sole basis for TFPI-2 gene silencing, as one or more components of the cellular transcription machinery that regulates TFPI-2 expression may also be hypermethylated leading to their silencing as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The existence of an aberrantly-spliced variant of TFPI-2 that is untranslated, and appears to be highly upregulated in tumor cells, suggests an additional, novel mechanism for further downregulation of TFPI-2 expression in tumor cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The results obtained in this study strongly suggest an additional mechanism in tumor cells to down regulate TFPI-2 expression by aberrant splicing. The existence of a novel TFPI-2 transcript predominantly in tumor cells has not been previously reported. While the present study suggests a direct correlation between the production of a novel TFPI-2 transcript and tumor development, further studies are needed to determine whether the alternative splicing of TFPI-2 pre-mRNA reported here is associated with tumor progression.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title><p>The human tumor cell lines J-82 (bladder cell carcinoma), Capan-2 (pancreatic adenocarcinoma), HepG2 (hepatocellular carcinoma), HT-1080 (fibrosarcoma), Colo-205 (colon adenocarcinoma), and HEK 293 (primary embryonal kidney), were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA).
