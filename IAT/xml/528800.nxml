The role of the lysine-rich and highly mobile Dps N-terminus in DNA protection has been investigated by comparing the self-aggregation and DNA-condensation capacity of wild-type Dps and two N-terminal deletion mutants, Dps&#x00394;8 and Dps&#x00394;18, lacking two or all three lysine residues, respectively. Gel mobility and atomic force microscopy imaging showed that at pH 6.3, both wild type and Dps&#x00394;8 self-aggregate, leading to formation of oligomers of variable size, and condense DNA with formation of large Dps&#x02013;DNA complexes. Conversely, Dps&#x00394;18 does not self-aggregate and binds DNA without causing condensation. At pH 8.2, Dps&#x00394;8 and Dps&#x00394;18 neither self-aggregate nor cause DNA condensation, a behavior also displayed by wild-type Dps at pH 8.7. Thus, Dps self-aggregation and Dps-driven DNA condensation are parallel phenomena that reflect the properties of the N-terminus. DNA protection against the toxic action of Fe(II) and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is not affected by the N-terminal deletions either <italic>in vitro</italic> or <italic>in vivo</italic>, in accordance with the different structural basis of this property.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Bacteria are faced with constantly changing habitats and, most importantly, with a variety of assaults due to nutrient limitation, high osmolarity, low pH and oxidative stress. Therefore, all bacteria have developed a large number of signal transduction and regulatory mechanisms that enable them to survive the stress conditions in the environment. Among the best-characterized ones are the systems operating in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. Under growth-limiting and potentially lethal conditions, <italic>E.coli</italic> cells express and accumulate a non-specific dodecameric DNA-binding protein named Dps, (<underline>D</underline>NA-binding <underline>p</underline>rotein from <underline>s</underline>tarved cells) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh915c1">1</xref>). In the stationary phase, Dps becomes the most abundant nucleoid component (180&#x02009;000 molecules per cell) and causes the compaction of DNA characteristic of this growth phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh915c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh915c3">3</xref>). Dps protects DNA effectively, both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, against oxidative cleavage, nucleases, UV light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh915c4">4</xref>) and thermal shock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh915c5">5</xref>). In <italic>E.coli</italic> K-12 and O157:H7, Dps also contributes to acid tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh915c6">6</xref>). Both oxidative and acid stress are associated with the production of hydroxyl radicals (OH<sup>&#x02022;</sup>) via Fenton-type reactions:</p><p><graphic xlink:href="gkh915equ1.gif"/></p><p>which lead mainly to DNA single and double strand breaks by oxidizing the sugar and base moieties.</p><p>Interaction between Dps and DNA, both in the purified state and in starved, stationary phase <italic>E.coli</italic> cells overexpressing Dps, is reported to result in the rapid formation of stable Dps&#x02013;DNA co-crystals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh915c7">7</xref>). However, the actual mode of the Dps&#x02013;DNA interaction has not been fully elucidated. The surface of the Dps dodecamer does not display canonical DNA-binding motifs, and is dominated by negative charges just as the DNA molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh915c8">8</xref>). On this basis, Frenkiel-Krispin <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh915c9">9</xref>) proposed that Dps dodecamers cannot bind DNA directly and that complex formation is mediated through ion bridges formed by Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> in a particular range of cation concentrations. The electrostatic potential calculations of Grant <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh915c8">8</xref>) however, did not consider the contribution of the disordered, lysine-containing N-terminus, not visible in the X-ray structure, which contains three lysine residues in positions 5, 8 and 10. Nevertheless, Grant <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh915c8">8</xref>) proposed a model of Dps&#x02013;DNA interaction in which a major role in complex formation is attributed precisely to the N-terminal lysine residues. Given the remarkably similar packing of Dps dodecamers in protein crystals and of Dps&#x02013;DNA complexes in electron microscopy preparations, Dps crystallization <italic>in vitro</italic> and binding of DNA were hypothesized to promote the same type of protein&#x02013;protein interactions. Thus, in the hexagonal Dps crystal lattice, three adjacent dodecamers define holes that are lined by the lysine-rich N-termini. In the Dps&#x02013;DNA complex, DNA is assumed to be threaded through such holes and to interact with the lysine residues. In accordance with this hypothesis, those members of the Dps family that do not possess a positively charged N-terminus do not appear to bind DNA based on agarose gel mobility assays. This is the case of the so-called <italic>Listeria innocua</italic> ferritin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh915c10">10</xref>), Dlp-1 and Dlp-2 from <italic>Bacillus anthracis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh915c11">11</xref>), and HP-NAP from <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh915c12">12</xref>). <italic>Agrobacterium tumefaciens</italic> Dps does not alter DNA mobility in spite of the presence of a lysine-containing, albeit shorter than usual, N-terminus. However, this N-terminus was shown to be tightly bound to the protein surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh915c13">13</xref>).</p><p>Irrespective of the occurrence of interaction, Dps proteins afford DNA protection against oxidative damage by inhibiting formation of the toxic hydroxyl radicals. This is achieved by removal of Fe(II) from solution in a multi-step process that comprises rapid binding of Fe(II) at the highly conserved intersubunit ferroxidase center identified in the <italic>L.innocua</italic> protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh915c14">14</xref>), Fe(II) oxidation by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, which is reduced to water, and sequestration of Fe(III) within the protein cavity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh915c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh915c15">15</xref>) where a microcrystalline iron core is formed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh915c16">16</xref>).</p><p>In the study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh915c15">15</xref>) that unveiled the H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> detoxification mechanism operative in <italic>E.coli</italic> Dps, the family prototype, self-aggregation of this protein became immediately apparent. Self-aggregation leads to formation of oligomers of variable size, which tend to precipitate as indicated by the onset of turbidity. In fact, at pH values around neutrality, <italic>E.coli</italic> Dps requires at least 150 mM NaCl to be maintained in solution, whereas Dps proteins that lack the positively charged N-terminus like the <italic>L.innocua</italic> protein are fully soluble even in the absence of added salt.</p><p>In order to inquire on the role of the positively charged N-terminus in DNA condensation and Dps self-aggregation, two deletion mutants were constructed, Dps&#x00394;8 and Dps&#x00394;18. Given the N-terminal sequence of the wt protein (MSTAKLVKSKATNLLYTRND), Dps&#x00394;8 lacks Lys-5 and Lys-8 while Dps&#x00394;18 lacks Lys-5, Lys-8, Lys-10 as well as Arg-18. The DNA-binding and self-aggregation properties of Dps&#x00394;8 and Dps&#x00394;18 were compared to those of the wild-type protein in gel mobility assays and atomic force microscopy (AFM) experiments. In addition, the effect of the N-terminal deletions on the capacity to protect DNA against the radicals resulting from the reaction of Fe(II) and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was assessed <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Construction of pet-11a-dps</title><p>Plasmid pet-11a-dps contains the <italic>E.coli dps</italic> gene cloned under the control of the isopropyl-&#x003b2;-<sc>d</sc>-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) inducible promoter of pet-11a (Novagen).

Dps&#x00394;18 is fully soluble over the whole pH range studied (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh915f1">1</xref>A&#x02013;C, lane 3). At any given pH, the increase in mobility follows the order wt Dps &#x0003c; Dps&#x00394;8 &#x0003c; Dps&#x00394;18, an indication that mobility reflects mainly the charge on the molecule.</p><p>Self-aggregation is reflected also by the onset of turbidity. Under conditions where the Dps proteins do not enter the agarose gel, the UV&#x0002f;visible spectrum shows clear evidence of turbidity. In the case of wt Dps at pH 6.3, for example, turbidity can be detected at protein concentrations as low as 60 nM.</p><p>Such turbidity measurements lend themselves to assess the dependence of Dps self-aggregation on the presence of Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> ions and EDTA. Frenkiel-Krispin <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh915c9">9</xref>) proposed that Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> ions may remain bound to Dps during its purification and that the presence of such cations within a particular concentration range is crucial for the formation of Dps&#x02013;DNA co-crystals. Turbidity measurements were carried out under the same conditions used by these authors in their <italic>in vitro</italic> DNA&#x02013;Dps co-crystallization experiments, namely 10 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl, 20 mM NaCl, at pH 7.0. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh915f2">2</xref>A shows that in the absence of added Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, the protein solutions have the same turbidity irrespective of the treatment with Chelex. Upon addition of Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>, turbidity decreases with increase in cation concentration and is abolished at about 1.5 mM Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>. In the presence of 0.4 mM EDTA, the Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> concentration required to abolish turbidity increases to about 2.0 mM. Importantly, treatment of the protein with Chelex has no effect, indicating that the purification procedure used in the present work effectively removes Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh915f2">2</xref>B shows the effect of EDTA additions to 10 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl, 20 mM NaCl, at two different pH values, 7.0 and 7.8. The reduction of turbidity promoted by EDTA is indicative of a pH-dependent interaction with the protein. In particular, 18 and 40 mM EDTA are required to clarify the protein solutions at pH 7.8 and 7.0, respectively.</p><p>To visualize Dps self-aggregation, wt protein and mutants in BAE&#x02013;TAE buffers covering the pH range 6.3&#x02013;8.7 were deposited onto freshly cleaved mica. For imaging purposes, protein concentration in AFM experiments was usually 10 nM, roughly one and two orders of magnitude lower than in turbidity and gel mobility measurements, respectively. At this low protein concentration, wt Dps appears as individual dodecamers and small aggregates at pH 6.3; at higher pH no aggregates were observed (see below). Neither Dps mutant exhibits aggregates at any pH value. This finding is of interest in comparison with the results obtained in the presence of DNA under similar conditions.</p></sec><sec><title>Dps-dependent condensation of DNA at different pH values</title><p>To compare wt and mutant Dps in their ability to interact with DNA, agarose gel mobility shift assays were performed using supercoiled pet-11a DNA as a probe. Reaction between 20 nM DNA and the Dps proteins in the concentration range 1&#x02013;5 &#x003bc;M was allowed to proceed in BAE&#x02013;TAE buffers, pH 6.3&#x02013;8.7. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh915f3">3</xref>A, interaction of either wt Dps or Dps&#x00394;8 with DNA at pH 6.3 generates complexes too large to migrate into the agarose gel. Conversely, in the presence of Dps&#x00394;18 migration of DNA occurs. However, the significant, albeit very small, decrease in mobility of the fastest moving band and the blurring of the slower moving ones point to a weak interaction of the protein with DNA. At pH 7.7&#x02013;8.2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh915f3">3</xref>B and C), the wt protein forms complexes with DNA that do not enter the agarose gel. Over the same pH range, Dps&#x00394;18 does not affect DNA mobility, whereas Dps&#x00394;8 alters slightly the pattern of DNA bands at pH 7.7, but not at pH 8.2. When pH is increased to 8.7 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh915f3">3</xref>D), none of the Dps proteins interferes with DNA mobility. Using plasmid pUC9-5S (3115 bp) or a linear 500 bp dsDNA as probes, or increasing Dps concentration to 30 &#x003bc;M while keeping the DNA concentration constant, did not change the results of the experiments (data not shown).</p><p>The influence of MgCl<sub>2</sub> on Dps&#x02013;DNA complex formation was explored under the same conditions employed for turbidity measurements, namely in 10 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl buffer, 20 mM NaCl, pH 7.0, using 1 &#x003bc;M wt Dps and 50 nM pUC9-5S (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh915f3">3</xref>E). When incubation is carried out in the absence of MgCl<sub>2</sub>, irrespective of the treatment with Chelex to remove divalent cations, all wt Dps forms large complexes with DNA that do not enter the agarose gel. When incubation is carried out in the presence of 3.75 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, the gel mobility shift assays indicate the presence of large complexes together with unbound DNA. Dps&#x02013;DNA interaction is abolished at 7.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, in agreement with the observations of Frenkiel-Krispin <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh915c9">9</xref>). Parallel experiments showed that neither NaCl (40&#x02013;100 mM) nor NiCl<sub>2</sub> (up to 20 mM) affect complex formation between wt Dps and DNA. The effect of NiCl<sub>2</sub> was analyzed because this salt was used to deposit DNA onto the mica surface in AFM experiments (see below). In addition, Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> in the concentration range 0&#x02013;10 mM does not promote Dps&#x00394;18&#x02013;DNA interaction, in contrast with the hypothesis that the doubly charged cation is involved in stabilization of the protein&#x02013;nucleic acid complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh915c6">6</xref>).</p><p>In a different set of gel retardation experiments that aimed at determining the average number of wt Dps molecules involved in DNA-containing complexes, 10 nM dsDNA (500 bp) was titrated with protein in the pH range 6.3&#x02013;8.7. At pH 6.3, DNA is saturated by 80 nM Dps; the corresponding Dps:DNA molar ratio of 8:1 indicates that about one Dps dodecamer is bound per 60 bp of DNA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh915f4">4</xref>). At higher pH values, the affinity and apparent binding stoichiometry progressively decrease (data not shown).</p><p>To visualize the Dps&#x02013;DNA interaction by AFM imaging, wt and mutant Dps, at the concentration of 10 nM, were mixed with 1 nM plasmid DNA (pUC9-5S) at different pH values in the range 6.3&#x02013;8.0. The mixtures were incubated for a few minutes at room temperature and deposited onto freshly cleaved ruby mica in the presence of 5 mM NiCl<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>The wt protein alone appears as single dodecamers well spread over the mica surface at pH 7.6 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh915f5">5</xref>A) even though some aggregates are formed at pH 6.3 (data not shown). In contrast, in the presence of DNA, all dodecamers are sequestered into large Dps&#x02013;DNA condensates, an indication of strong macromolecular interactions. These large Dps&#x02013;DNA condensates appear to contain one or more plasmid molecules looping out from a central Dps aggregate; their size decreases dramatically upon rising pH. In some cases, the Dps&#x02013;DNA complexes are too large to permit visualization of the DNA molecules involved (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh915f5">5</xref>B&#x02013;D). When the amount of protein is decreased 2- to 3-fold, numerous DNA molecules appear to be protein-free, but the average size of the protein&#x02013;DNA condensates remains essentially the same (data not shown).</p><p>The N-terminal deletion mutant Dps&#x00394;8 forms aggregates at pH 6.3 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh915f5">5</xref>E) whereas it binds to DNA with no condensation at pH 7.8 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh915f5">5</xref>F), in agreement with the gel mobility data. Notably, at pH 6.3 Dps&#x00394;8 aggregation is not complete as shown by the numerous single dodecamers spread over the mica surface, an indication of a weaker macromolecular interactions. Dps&#x00394;18 does not give rise to condensates when mixed with DNA even at pH 6.3 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh915f5">5</xref>G). Despite the absence of DNA condensation, Dps molecules are bound to the DNA plasmid randomly and appear as &#x02018;beads on a string&#x02019;. The DNA contour length of Dps-bound plasmids in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh915f5">5</xref>F&#x02013;H is comparable with that of the protein-free plasmids indicating that dodecamer binding to DNA does not entail wrapping and other modes of DNA compaction.</p><p>The influence of MgCl<sub>2</sub> on the wt Dps&#x02013;DNA interaction was also explored. In accordance with the gel shift experiments, no Dps&#x02013;DNA aggregates are obtained when 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> is added to the reaction buffer TAE, pH 8.0 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh915f5">5</xref>H). Likewise, rinsing the surface with a 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> solution results in an almost complete disaggregation of the Dps&#x02013;DNA complexes.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>In vitro</italic> DNA protection against hydroxyl radical formation by wt Dps and Dps&#x00394;18</title><p>To establish whether the N-terminal deletion mutant Dps&#x00394;18 is able to protect DNA from oxidative damage under conditions where no binding is observed, <italic>in vitro</italic> DNA damage assays were performed. <italic>E.coli</italic> wt Dps was used as a control.

The present study shows that formation of such complexes is tightly linked to the capacity of <italic>E.coli</italic> Dps to self-aggregate and that both properties are correlated with the presence of the lysine-rich N-terminus.</p><p>Self-aggregation in solution is an unrecognized feature of <italic>E.coli</italic> Dps despite the fact that polymerization is apparent from the immediate onset of turbidity when protein solutions are brought to pH values around and below neutrality in buffers of ionic strength 30&#x02013;50 mM. Formation of large aggregates is manifest also in the electrophoretic behavior of the wt protein, which is unable to enter the agarose gels below pH 8.2. In turn, the deletion mutants Dps&#x00394;8 and Dps&#x00394;18, lacking, respectively, two or all three N-terminus lysine residues, exhibit a behavior different from that of the wt protein as a function of pH. Thus, self-aggregation of the Dps&#x00394;8 mutant is apparent only below pH 7.3, whereas the Dps&#x00394;18 mutant does not self-aggregates even at pH 6.3, the lowest pH investigated (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh915f1">1</xref>). It follows that the cornerstone of the protein&#x02013;protein interaction lies in the N-terminus, where the only titrating group(s) are the lysine residues in positions 5, 8 and 10. Given the pH range favoring self-aggregation, the pK values of these lysine residues must be anomalously low. Interestingly, the 23-symmetry (tetrahedral) of the Dps dodecamer brings the N-terminus at the edge of the 2-fold interfaces such that Lys-10, visible in one of the subunits, lies near the Arg-55 and His-112 residues of the symmetry related monomer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh915c8">8</xref>). Thus, this positive patch, in the surrounding of the N-terminus lysine side chains, should lead to a significant decrease of the pK value. We propose that Dps self-aggregation is governed by the protonation state of the N-terminus lysines. When protonated, the N-terminus lysines are envisaged to interact with negatively charged carboxyl groups at the surface of neighboring Dps molecules. Though increased by this interaction, the pK values of the N-terminus lysines remain close to the value of physiological pH as indicated by the pH-dependence of self-aggregation (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh915tb1">1</xref>). This situation is not unprecedented. In cytochrome c, for example, lysine residues with pK values &#x0003c;7.0 are located within the positively charged recognition patch, which is involved in the interaction with physiological partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh915c20">20</xref>).</p><p>When interaction with DNA is monitored by means of gel electrophoresis under the conditions used to follow Dps self-aggregation, it becomes apparent that whenever Dps proteins do not migrate in agarose gels, large complexes with DNA are formed that likewise do not enter agarose gels (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh915f1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh915f3">3</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh915tb1">1</xref>). The Dps&#x00394;8 and Dps&#x00394;18 mutants, at pH values around 7.7&#x02013;7.8 and 6.3, respectively, do not self-aggregate although interaction with DNA manifests itself in slight, albeit significant, changes in DNA mobility (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh915f3">3</xref>) indicative of DNA binding with no condensation.</p><p>The picture which emerges is that both Dps self-aggregation and condensation of DNA are processes correlated with the nature of the N-terminus. More specifically, the number of the N-terminus lysine residues appears to determine whether interaction with DNA will lead to formation of large complexes or not. The AFM images obtained with the Dps&#x00394;8 mutant provide decisive information in this respect as they allow one to visualize protein binding to DNA distinctly from condensation. Either one of the two situations can be made visible, in full agreement with the gel electrophoresis experiments, by operating at the appropriate pH value. Thus, at pH values around 7.7&#x02013;7.8 all plasmids contain few Dps&#x00394;8 molecules bound as single dodecamers and resemble free plasmids in their morphology (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh915f5">5</xref>F), whereas at pH 6.3 condensation takes place and DNA appears bundled in folded loops in the periphery of large protein aggregates (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh915f5">5</xref>E). Similar DNA condensates are produced by the wt protein at all pH values investigated (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh915f5">5</xref>C and D). In contrast, the Dps&#x00394;18 mutant binds DNA, albeit without formation of condensates, only at pH 6.3, the lowest pH value investigated (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh915f5">5</xref>G), in agreement with the gel electrophoresis data. The charge on the N-terminus therefore determines not only whether self-aggregation will occur, but also the mode of interaction with DNA. Self-aggregation and DNA condensation both require full protonation of at least one lysine residue (Lys-10) as shown by the Dps&#x00394;8 mutant, whereas DNA binding can take place in the absence of the lysine-containing N-terminus as in Dps&#x00394;18, at least at slightly acid pH values. This is probably due to the presence of other residues on the protein surface that ionize in this pH range (e.g. His-112 and His-117).</p><p>The positively charged N-termini have a regular disposition on the protein surface, which is dictated by the highly symmetrical assembly of the dodecamer. It follows that individual Dps dodecamers can interact simultaneously with other Dps and&#x0002f;or DNA molecules. The sequence of the events leading to DNA condensation is schematized in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh915f7">7</xref>A. Dps dodecamers bind DNA at random with no sequence specificity. Thereby the plasmid-bound Dps molecules become confined in space. The consequent increase in local protein concentration favors the mutual interaction between Dps molecules bound on the same or on neighboring DNA plasmids inducing DNA looping and condensation. In turn, protein&#x02013;protein interactions between such relatively small Dps&#x02013;DNA multimeric complexes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh915f7">7</xref>B), can foster the formation of larger structures in a strongly cooperative fashion. A similar two-step mechanism has been proposed for other DNA-condensing proteins e.g. RIP60 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh915c21">21</xref>). It may be argued that the highly symmetrical disposition of the N-termini on the surface of the Dps dodecamer lends itself to the formation of ordered structures such as those observed in the nucleoid of starved <italic>E.coli</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh915c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh915c9">9</xref>).</p><p>Due to their common structural basis, Dps self-aggregation and DNA condensation display a similar dependence on pH and on the presence of salts or small charged molecules capable of binding to the macromolecular partners. The latter aspect is of special relevance in view of the suggestion by Frenkiel-Krispin <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh915c9">9</xref>) that the Dps dodecamer cannot interact directly with DNA, but only through bridges formed by Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> within a particular concentration range. This conclusion was based on <italic>in vitro</italic> Dps&#x02013;DNA co-crystallization experiments conducted in the presence of MgCl<sub>2</sub> and EDTA at different concentrations. However, both MgCl<sub>2</sub> and EDTA interact with Dps, as shown clearly by experiments in which the two molecules are studied separately under conditions of controlled ionic composition, and the interaction abolishes Dps self-aggregation and DNA condensation at appropriate concentrations (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh915f2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh915f3">3</xref>E). In addition, given the parallelism between the two processes, Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> should be able to promote self-aggregation yet this is not observed: neither in the wt protein nor in the Dps&#x00394;18 mutant. A full analysis of the complex interplay between pH, Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> and EDTA binding delineated by these results is beyond the scope of the present work.</p><p>A final important point concerns the effect of the N-terminal deletion on the ability of Dps to protect DNA from the reactive oxygen species generated during aerobic metabolism, e.g. the hydroxyl radicals produced from H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and Fe(II) through Fenton chemistry. The N-terminal deletion mutant Dps&#x00394;18, which is unable to bind and condense DNA at physiological pH values, exerts a protective effect comparable to that of the wt protein not only <italic>in vitro</italic> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh915f6">6</xref>A), but also <italic>in vivo</italic> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh915f6">6</xref>B). Thus, the bacterial cells expressing wt Dps or the Dps&#x00394;18 mutant grow similarly and up to higher H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> levels than the strain that lacks the <italic>dps</italic> gene (&#x0223c;10 mM versus &#x0223c;1 mM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>). This result is in accordance with the knowledge that protection of DNA against the toxic action of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> depends on the capacity of Dps to sequester Fe(II) and convert it to Fe(III) using H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> as an oxidant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh915c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh915c15">15</xref>). It is also in keeping with recent studies that assign to Dps an important role in the protection of several bacterial pathogens, like <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh915c22">22</xref>), <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh915c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh915c23">23</xref>), <italic>Campylobacter jejuni</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh915c24">24</xref>), <italic>Porphyromonas gingivalis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh915c25">25</xref>), <italic>Streptococcus suis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh915c26">26</xref>), from H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> produced by the host phagocytes during infection. Among these pathogens only <italic>S.enterica</italic> Dps possesses a lysine-rich N-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh915c22">22</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, the recognition that Dps self-aggregation is the driving force in the formation of large Dps&#x02013;DNA complexes represents yet another proof that protein&#x02013;protein interactions play a major role in nucleoid structuring. In terms of the dual mechanism of DNA protection, the present data confirm that the highly conserved capacity of Dps proteins to oxidize and uptake iron provides a universal protection mechanism towards oxidative DNA damage. The physical protection afforded by Dps&#x02013;DNA condensation appears to be restricted to those species whose Dps proteins possess a lysine-containing, freely mobile N-terminus. It may be hypothesized that the latter mechanism applies to DNA protection against detrimental factors other than hydroxyl radicals like nucleases, UV and &#x003b3; radiation, high temperature and chemical mutagens. Interestingly, <italic>E.coli</italic> Dps has a higher affinity for DNA at acidic pH values that mimic the stress conditions typically encountered by enterobacteria during host-infection, prolonged periods of starvation and acid stress challenges.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkh915f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Self-aggregation of <italic>E.coli</italic> Dps at different pH values, monitored by agarose gel electrophoresis.

(<bold>A</bold>) Proposed model. Dps dodecamers are depicted as gray circles with dark patches representing the positively charged N-terminal tail of the monomers. For simplicity, the patches are drawn without correlation to the number and symmetry of the N-termini within the Dps dodecamer. Wt-Dps, Dps&#x00394;8 and Dps&#x00394;18 dodecamers bind DNA in a non-specific manner by interaction with the negatively charged phosphate groups. The binding of several Dps dodecamers to the same DNA plasmid confines the proteins in space. Thereby the local protein concentration is increased and mutual interactions between Dps molecules bound to the same plasmid or to closely spaced ones can take place. The different behavior of the wt and mutant proteins and the pH dependence of the DNA condensation process are determined by the number of lysine residues in the N-terminus and their pK values. In wt Dps, the interaction capacity of the N-terminus is at its highest due to the presence of three lysine residues. Thus, interaction with DNA is driven towards condensation even at pH values where the lysine residues are not fully protonated, e.g. at pH 8.0. In the Dps&#x00394;8 mutant, the N-terminus has a lower interaction capacity since it carries only Lys-10. Thus, interaction with DNA is driven towards condensation only at pH values where full protonation of this lysine residue occurs, i.e. at pH &#x0003c; 7.7. At higher pH values, interaction is either limited to the binding step (i.e. over the range pH 7.7&#x02013;8.0) or does not take place at all (e.g. at pH 8.2) due to the progressive deprotonation of Lys-10. The latter scenario applies also to Dps&#x00394;18, which lacks the N-terminus lysines; the limited binding observed at pH 6.3 may be ascribed to other positively charged residues (e.g. histidines) on the protein surface.
