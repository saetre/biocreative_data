The number and distribution of crossovers are tightly controlled, but the factors that contribute to this control are poorly understood in most organisms, including mammals. Here we provide evidence that the ATM kinase or protein is essential for proper crossover formation in mouse spermatocytes. ATM deficiency causes multiple phenotypes in humans and mice, including gonadal atrophy. Mouse <italic>Atm<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> spermatocytes undergo apoptosis at mid-prophase of meiosis I, but <italic>Atm<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> meiotic phenotypes are partially rescued by <italic>Spo11</italic> heterozygosity, such that ATM-deficient spermatocytes progress to meiotic metaphase I. Strikingly, <italic>Spo11<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup>Atm<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> spermatocytes are defective in forming the obligate crossover on the sex chromosomes, even though the XY pair is usually incorporated in a sex body and is transcriptionally inactivated as in normal spermatocytes. The XY crossover defect correlates with the appearance of lagging chromosomes at metaphase I, which may trigger the extensive metaphase apoptosis that is observed in these cells. In addition, control of the number and distribution of crossovers on autosomes appears to be defective in the absence of ATM because there is an increase in the total number of MLH1 foci, which mark the sites of eventual crossover formation, and because interference between MLH1 foci is perturbed. The axes of autosomes exhibit structural defects that correlate with the positions of ongoing recombination. Together, these findings indicate that ATM plays a role in both crossover control and chromosome axis integrity and further suggests that ATM is important for coordinating these features of meiotic chromosome dynamics.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Meiosis is the specialized cell division that gives rise to reproductive cells such as sperm and eggs. During meiosis in most organisms, genetic information is exchanged between homologous maternal and paternal chromosomes through the process of homologous recombination. This recombination forms connections between homologous chromosomes that allow them to segregate accurately when the meiotic cell divides. Recombination defects can result in reproductive cells with abnormal chromosome numbers, which are a major cause of developmental disorders and spontaneous abortions in humans. Meiotic recombination is tightly controlled such that each pair of chromosomes undergoes at least one crossover recombination event despite a low average number of crossovers per chromosome. Moreover, multiple crossovers on the same chromosome tend to be evenly and widely spaced. Mechanisms of this control are not well understood, but here we provide evidence that ATM protein is required for normal operation of this process(es) in male mice. ATM has long been known to be involved in cellular responses to DNA damage. Our studies reveal a new function for this protein and also provide new insight into the mechanisms by which meiotic cells ensure accurate transmission of genetic material from one generation to the next.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="17"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Crossing-over between homologous chromosomes in conjunction with sister chromatid cohesion provides physical connections necessary for accurate chromosome segregation during the first meiotic division <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000076-Page1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Due to their central role in meiosis, crossovers are tightly controlled in most organisms such that each chromosome pair gets at least one crossover, and multiple crossovers on the same chromosome tend to be evenly and widely spaced <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000076-Hillers1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000076-Jones1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. One example of this control is the fact that non-exchange chromosomes are very rare even though the average number of crossovers per chromosome pair is low (often only 1&#x02013;2 per pair). This observed tendency for at least one crossover to form per pair of homologous chromosomes is often referred to as the &#x0201c;obligate&#x0201d; crossover <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000076-Jones1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. (The obligate crossover is viewed as one of the outcomes of the process(es) through which most crossovers form, not as a special type of crossover.) An especially striking example of this phenomenon is the sex chromosomes in males of many mammalian species, for which recombination between the X and Y is restricted to a relatively short region of homology, the pseudoautosomal region or PAR, which is &#x0223c;700 kb in some mouse strains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000076-Perry1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Because a crossover must be formed to ensure segregation of the X and Y, the crossover rate per Mb of DNA is orders of magnitude higher in the PAR than in other regions of the genome.</p><p>A second manifestation of the regulation of crossing-over is interference, in which crossing-over in one genomic region makes it less likely that another crossover will be found nearby <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000076-Hillers1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000076-Jones1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000076-Kleckner1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000076-Broman1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. A third manifestation is crossover homeostasis, documented in budding yeast as a tendency for crossover numbers to be maintained despite reduction in the number of recombination initiation events <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000076-Martini1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The number and distribution of crossovers are thus subject to multiple layers of regulation, which include both crossover-promoting (e.g., the obligate crossover and crossover homeostasis) and crossover-suppressing (e.g., interference) aspects. The term &#x0201c;crossover control&#x0201d; is often used as a catchall phrase to encompass these distinct aspects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000076-Jones1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. The various manifestations of crossover control may reflect a single underlying mechanism or closely interrelated set of mechanisms, although this remains to be experimentally verified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000076-Hillers1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000076-Jones1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000076-Kleckner1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000076-Borner1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref> but see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000076-Shinohara1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>). The biochemical and genetic factors that govern crossover number and distribution are not well understood in most organisms, including in mammals.</p><p>Although key for chromosome segregation, crossing-over between homologous chromosomes is just one outcome of meiotic recombination, since noncrossovers also occur. Meiotic recombination initiates with DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) introduced by the SPO11 transesterase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000076-Keeney1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>.

Evidence from <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, for which the mechanisms of meiotic recombination are best understood, suggests that the crossover versus noncrossover decision is made at or about this step during meiotic prophase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000076-Bishop1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>.

These findings strongly indicate that the loss of ATM impairs the repair of meiotic DSBs, suggesting that ATM plays a role in promoting meiotic recombination rather than only serving a monitoring function.

In each of 20 <italic>Spo11<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> spermatocytes examined, Chr10 and SYCP3 signals were both uninterrupted, as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000076-g005">Figure 5E</xref>). Most <italic>Spo11<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup>Atm<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> spermatocytes also showed uninterrupted SYCP3 and Chr10 FISH signals (data not shown), but a gap in SYCP3 staining was observed in 11 of 57 cells examined (19.3&#x00025;). For these cells, about half still had a continuous Chr10 FISH signal even though there was a gap in the SYCP3 staining (10.5&#x00025; of total) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000076-g005">Figure 5F</xref>). The overall continuity of these bivalents suggests that the DNA continuity is preserved (at least for a subset of the four chromatids) and that it is instead the continuity of axial and/or SC structure that is disrupted. Interestingly, each of the remaining spermatocytes had two separated chr10 fragments (8.8&#x00025; of total) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000076-g005">Figure 5G</xref>). Analysis of chr3 gave similar results (data not shown). These findings suggest the possibility that chromosome axis defects (discontinuities in SYCP3 staining) were often associated with compromised chromosome integrity leading to overt chromosome fragmentation. A possible explanation for these observations is that &#x0201c;weak spots&#x0201d; on axes are susceptible to disruptive forces from chromosome spreading procedures resulting in extreme stretching or even complete severing of the DNA of all four chromatids. Alternatively, stretching and/or chromatid severing occur in vivo, perhaps as a consequence of large-scale chromosome movements that have been documented during meiotic prophase in some organisms (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000076-Scherthan1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Mouse chromosomes are acrocentric, that is, with the centromere near one end.

TRF1 detection efficiency on telomeres of full-length chromosomes was comparable (99.5&#x00025;, <italic>n</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;684 chromosomes). The spreads also contained longer SC fragments with just one telomere, and for these, the telomeric end also contained a centromere (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000076-g005">Figure 5I</xref>, upper inset). Overall, centromere-containing SC fragments were significantly longer (5.2&#x000b1;2.3 &#x003bc;m) than non-centromeric SC fragments (2.7&#x000b1;2.0 &#x003bc;m, <italic>p</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.0001, <italic>t</italic> test).

Thus, the spacing between foci is less regular in the absence of ATM. This difference is still seen if distances are normalized for total SC length (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000076.s005">Figure S5</xref> and data not shown), suggesting that the difference is not simply a consequence of the longer SCs resulting in more spread-out foci in ATM-deficient cells.

Importantly, this result cannot be an artifact of longer SCs or the presence of gaps, because these would be expected to increase observed inter-focus distances, not decrease them. Indeed, the effect of ATM deficiency was even more pronounced if distances were measured as percent of SC length, which normalizes for the increase (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000076.s005">Figure S5</xref>).</p><p>The same conclusions were drawn if we considered only chromosomes without obvious SC gaps (data not shown).

The gamma distribution that best fits the observed frequency distribution is characterized by a shape parameter (abbreviated &#x0201c;&#x003bd;&#x0201d;), which can be regarded as a measure of the strength of interference between MLH1 foci: a value of &#x003bd;&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;1 implies no interference, whereas higher &#x003bd; values indicate more regular spacing between foci, and thus stronger interference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000076-deBoer1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000076-g007">Figure 7B and 7C</xref>).

Perhaps there is a threshold amount of DSBs below which another kinase (e.g., ATR) can partially substitute for ATM; above this threshold, the number of DSBs may exceed the capacity for this kinase to substitute.

It is possible that apoptosis is triggered by a spindle checkpoint responding to the lagging chromosomes observed at metaphase I, which are likely to be the frequently achiasmate X and Y. Indeed, metaphase I spermatocyte apoptosis has been observed in several instances where one or a few achiasmate chromosomes are present because of chromosomal abnormalities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000076-Eaker1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000076-Sutcliffe1">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref>, as well as in <italic>Mlh1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice in which most chromosomes lack chiasmata <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000076-Eaker2">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref>.

The mammalian XY pair shares homology only within the very small PAR, and as a result, the crossover frequency in males is elevated &#x0003e;100-fold in the PAR over the genome average. DSB frequency in the PAR must be elevated at least 10-fold over the genome average to ensure that the PAR receives at least one DSB. (Up to 300 DSBs are estimated per 3&#x000d7;10<sup>9</sup> bp per haploid genome, or 1 DSB per 10<sup>7</sup> bp, while the mouse PAR is estimated to be &#x0003c;10<sup>6</sup> bp long <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000076-Perry1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>.) But it is also likely that a DSB(s) within this limited physical distance has a greater probability of being converted to a crossover than the &#x0201c;average&#x0201d; DSB on an autosome. Thus, we infer that one or more aspects of crossover control play a particularly important role within the PAR to ensure formation of the obligate crossover. By this reasoning, XY recombination should be uniquely sensitive to perturbations in crossover control as well as to other defects in interhomolog recombination more generally. Here, we demonstrate that <italic>Spo11<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup>Atm<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> spermatocytes frequently contain an achiasmate X and Y pair. <italic>Spo11<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> spermatocytes have no such difficulty, hence this defect can be attributed specifically to the lack of ATM. While it is formally possible that the achiasmate XY configuration reflects a defect in sister chromatid cohesion, we favor the interpretation that ATM-deficient cells have difficulty in forming the obligate XY crossover because a crossover defect could account for frequent failure of XY homologous synapsis, as SC formation is thought to initiate at crossover-designated recombination sites (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000076-Zickler1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000076-Kleckner2">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>).</p><p>Several factors contribute to forming an obligate crossover. At least one DSB must form per chromosome pair and the proper recombination partner (the homolog rather than the sister) must be located and engaged. Furthermore, differentiation of individual recombination events into crossovers must also be controlled. This control involves a &#x0201c;decision&#x0201d; early in the recombination reaction that determines whether a given DSB will become a crossover rather than a noncrossover, plus enforcement of this decision to ensure formation of the correct recombinant product <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000076-Borner1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000076-Bishop1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. In principle, ATM could contribute to one or more of these processes. However, we consider it unlikely that a DSB deficit explains the frequent crossover failure in <italic>Spo11<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup>Atm<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> spermatocytes: <italic>Spo11</italic> heterozygosity itself does not cause an XY crossover problem, and absence of ATM does not significantly decrease numbers of RAD51 foci in a <italic>Spo11<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> background, suggesting that ATM deficiency does not reduce DSB frequency. Therefore, it is possible that the XY defect reflects a requirement for ATM in promoting the XY crossover per se. There are several nonexclusive possibilities. ATM may be required for proper designation of a crossover outcome, either as part of the regulation of the crossover vs. noncrossover decision or as part of the response to that decision once it has been made. This model would implicate ATM in crossover control, consistent with effects on autosomes (see below) and consistent with the observation that orthologs of ATM/ATR promote crossover interference in budding yeast via phosphorylation of the single-stranded binding protein RPA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000076-Bartrand1">&#x0005b;58&#x0005d;</xref>. Another possibility is that crossover designation occurs properly in the absence of ATM, but that there is a defect in later steps of recombination such that crossover or chiasma formation fails. Notably, however, there was no detectable increase in achiasmate autosomes, suggesting that ATM is not strictly required for maturing chiasmata.</p><p>A third possibility is that ATM is required for efficient homologous pairing and/or choice of partner for recombination (i.e., homolog versus sister). This hypothesis would place ATM function at or prior to the step when the homologous chromosome is located and engaged, i.e., before a decision is made about a crossover vs. noncrossover outcome. Further studies of the kinetics and efficiency of homologous pairing in normal and ATM-deficient mouse meiosis are necessary to distinguish between these possibilities. However, it is interesting to note that budding yeast ATM/ATR orthologs are required to suppress recombination between ectopic repeated sequences and to promote the normal bias toward interhomolog rather than intersister recombination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000076-Carballo2">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000076-Grushcow1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Why is there an obligate crossover defect on the XY but not on autosomes? One reasonable explanation is that the small size of the PAR makes this region uniquely sensitive to defects in any or all of the processes listed above. At &#x0223c;55&#x02013;58 Mbp, even the smallest autosome (Chr19) is some 80 times as long as the PAR and forms on average 4&#x02013;5 RPA and MSH4 foci, of which typically only one will give rise to a crossover <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000076-deBoer1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>. The formation of multiple DSBs along each autosomal bivalent means that there are multiple opportunities to promote pairing and to successfully execute chiasma formation, such that a partial defect in pairing, in formation of crossovers, or in regulation of crossover number and distribution might have little effect on the frequency of non-exchange bivalents. In contrast, the XY pair may have as little as a single DSB within the PAR in any one cell, which would place a much greater premium on efficient execution of all of the steps that lead to chiasma formation.</p></sec><sec id="s3a2"><title>Crossover Interference</title><p>Meiotic recombination is also subject to one or more activities that depress the total number of crossovers and ensure that crossovers are widely and evenly spaced. <italic>Spo11<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup>Atm<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> spermatocytes had a small but significant defect in cytological interference, suggesting that ATM is required for normal crossover interference. We cannot exclude the possibility that the increased heterogeneity in inter-MLH1 focus distances is simply a consequence of altered axis structure instead of altered crossover interference (e.g., if ATM deficiency causes the SC to appear stretched in some places and compressed in others, such that distances along the axis do not share the same relationship with DNA distances as in wild type). However, such a scenario would not explain the accompanying increase in the number of autosomal MLH1 foci in <italic>Spo11<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup>Atm<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> spermatocytes. We therefore favor the interpretation that ATM is partially required for both of these suppressive aspects of crossover control. One possibility is that ATM-deficient cells form a small number of &#x0201c;extra&#x0201d; autosomal crossovers that do not display the normal constraints on number and position. Such an outcome could occur if ATM is involved in making or enforcing the crossover vs. noncrossover decision locally at recombination sites, and/or if it is involved in propagation or response to crossover-inhibiting signals between adjacent recombination sites.</p><p>Lack of ATM causes defects in both crossover-promoting (the obligate XY crossover) and crossover-suppressing (interference) aspects of meiotic recombination.

Additional primary antibodies were rabbit anti-MLH1 (Calbiochem PC56T), 1&#x02236;75 dilution; rabbit anti-RAD51 (Oncogene), 1&#x02236;250; rabbit anti-TRF1 (generously provided by T. de Lange, Rockefeller Univ.), 1&#x02236;200; guinea pig anti-STAG3 (generous gift of C.

For RAD51 and MLH1 focus counts, nuclei were staged according to the extent of SYCP3 staining and synapsis. Leptonema was defined as having short, unsynapsed SYCP3 fragments. Early zygonema was defined as &#x0003c;50&#x00025; synapsis and late zygonema was defined as &#x0003e;50&#x00025; but less than 100&#x00025; synapsis. Only nuclei with at least 19 autosomal MLH1 foci were considered for MLH1 counts, and only RAD51 and MLH1 foci that co-localized with SYCP3 staining were counted.</p><p>Detailed methods for testis sectioning and immunohistochemistry are described elsewhere <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000076-Barchi1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. Briefly, for histological analysis, sections were stained by periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) and hematoxylin. Spermatogenic staging of PAS-stained seminiferous tubule sections was as described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000076-Russell1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. For immunohistochemistry, anti-phospho-histone H3 antibody (Upstate Cell Signaling) was used at 5 &#x003bc;g/ml and detected with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies using DAB as a substrate; slides were counter-stained with hematoxylin.</p><p>For analysis of meiotic spindles, 30-&#x003bc;m testis sections were placed on poly-L-lysine (Sigma) coated slides, and dried 2 hr, followed by a 2 hr incubation at 37&#x000b0;C.

Coverslips were mounted using ProLong Gold (Molecular Probes) containing DAPI.

SpectrumGreen-conjugated (Vysis, Abbott Labs) PAR-specific probe was prepared from mouse BAC RP24-500I4 (CHORI). Paints for chromosomes 10 and 3 were from Cambio. SKY was performed as described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000076-Heng1">&#x0005b;64&#x0005d;</xref>. Metaphase cells were documented with a Nikon E800, and images were analyzed using the SKYview 2.1.1 software.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Interference and Statistical Analyses</title><p>Autosomal SC lengths and MLH1 focus positions were recorded using MicroMeasure, version 3.01 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.colostate.edu/Depts/Biology/MicroMeasure">http://www.colostate.edu/Depts/Biology/MicroMeasure</ext-link>). MLH1 position was measured from the centromeric end of the chromosome as revealed by the brighter DAPI staining of pericentromeric heterochromatin. Once SC length and the position of each MLH1 focus were obtained, the SCs in each spread were rank-ordered based on their absolute length, from rank 1 (longest) to rank 19 (shortest). Similarly ranked SCs were grouped to allow comparison of similar chromosomes between cells and genotypes. Based in part on published analyses of autosomal SC sizes using combined FISH and immunofluorescence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000076-Froenicke1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>, we chose the following groupings: ranks 1&#x02013;2 (i.e., the two longest SCs in each spread), ranks 3&#x02013;5, ranks 6&#x02013;11, ranks 12&#x02013;16, and ranks 17&#x02013;19. For SCs containing gaps, the length of the gap was subtracted from the total length of the bivalent. Whenever possible for SC fragments, the lengths of fragments that appeared to originate from the same bivalent were combined to estimate the complete SC length for ranking purposes. Best fits of frequency distributions of MLH1 inter-focus distances to the gamma distribution were calculated using the GenStat software package (VSN International Ltd, Hemel Hempstead, UK), as described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000076-deBoer1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>. Correction was applied as described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000076-deBoer1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref> to adjust &#x003bd; values for the limited number of interfocus distances that can be measured (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000076-t002">Table 2</xref>). Other statistical tests were as specified in the text. We applied the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U Test to total numbers of MLH1 foci per cell to avoid the need to assume that the data were normally distributed. However, similar conclusions as to statistical significance were drawn if a t test was used instead (data not shown). Two-by-two contingency tables were subjected to two-tailed Fisher's exact tests. For larger contingency tables, a log-likelihood test for heterogeneity (G test) was applied.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pgen.1000076.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Additional examples of seminiferous tubule sections from <italic>Spo11<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup>Atm<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice.
