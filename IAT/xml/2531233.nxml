During male spermatogenesis, <italic>Tex19.1</italic> expression is highest in mitotic spermatogonia and diminishes as these cells differentiate and progress through meiosis. In pluripotent stem cells, <italic>Tex19.1</italic> expression is also downregulated upon differentiation. However, it is not clear whether <italic>Tex19.1</italic> has an essential function in germ cells or pluripotent stem cells, or what that function might be. To analyse the potential role of <italic>Tex19.1</italic> in pluripotency or germ cell function we have generated <italic>Tex19.1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> knockout mice and analysed the <italic>Tex19.1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mutant phenotype. Adult <italic>Tex19.1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> knockout males exhibit impaired spermatogenesis. Immunostaining and histological analysis revealed defects in meiotic chromosome synapsis, the persistence of DNA double-strand breaks during meiosis, and a loss of post-meiotic germ cells in the testis. Furthermore, expression of a class of endogenous retroviruses is upregulated during meiosis in the <italic>Tex19.1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> testes. Increased transposition of endogenous retroviruses in the germline of <italic>Tex19.1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mutant mice, and the concomitant increase in DNA damage, may be sufficient to disrupt the normal processes of recombination and chromosome synapsis during meiosis and cause defects in spermatogenesis.

As any genetic changes that arise in the germ cells can be transmitted to the next generation, germ cells are a prime target for the activity of mobile genetic elements. Mobile genetic elements make up around 40&#x00025; of a mammalian genome, and many of these elements are derived from retroviruses that have infected germ cells, or early embryonic precursors to germ cells, and have integrated into the genome. Here, we characterise the function of <italic>Tex19.1</italic>, a gene whose expression is restricted to germ cells and the pluripotent cells that are early embryonic precursors to germ cells. We show that when <italic>Tex19.1</italic> is deleted from mice, germ cells have problems progressing through meiosis, and sperm production is impaired. Furthermore, we show that, in the absence of <italic>Tex19.1</italic>, endogenous retroviruses are activated in male germ cells attempting to go through meiosis. Our results suggest that <italic>Tex19.1</italic> is part of a specialised mechanism that guards against mutagenic endogenous retrovirus activity in germ cells and pluripotent cells and thus helps to maintain the integrity and stability of the genome through successive generations.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="16"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The germ cells of sexually reproducing organisms have a unique role in generating genetic diversity and transmitting genetic information from one generation to the next. Establishment of the germline in mammals involves the induction of germ cells from pluripotent epiblast cells through the action of extra-embryonic ectoderm-derived bone morphogenetic proteins and occurs comparatively late in development, commencing around day 6.25 days post coitum (dpc) in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000199-Lawson1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000199-Ohinata1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. At around 12.5 dpc -13.5 dpc the sexually dimorphic germ cells become committed to develop along either a male or a female pathway and start to initiate sex-specific differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000199-Adams1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Although there are numerous differences in the differentiation of the germline and in the timing and regulation of meiosis between the sexes, the fundamental events of meiosis that increase genetic diversity and reduce ploidy of the gametes are common to both.</p><p>The main group of genes that have been shown to be required for mammalian meiosis are those involved in the recombination and synapsis of homologous chromosomes. Mice carrying loss-of-function mutations in these genes, such as <italic>Atm</italic>, <italic>Dmc1</italic>, <italic>&#x003b3;H2AX, Mlh1</italic>, <italic>Msh5</italic>, <italic>Rec8</italic>, <italic>Rad51</italic>, <italic>Smc1&#x003b2;</italic>, <italic>Spo11</italic>, <italic>Sycp1</italic>, <italic>Sycp2</italic>, <italic>Sycp3, Syce2</italic> and <italic>Tex14</italic>, typically exhibit defects in chromosome synapsis in both sexes, although male and female germ cells can exhibit different responses to these defects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000199-Costa1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000199-Bult1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>A second group of genes that are required for progression through meiosis are those involved in repression of transposable genetic elements. Retrotransposons, for example long interspersed repeats (LINEs), short interspersed repeats (SINEs), and endogenous retroviruses such as intracisternal A-particles (IAPs) are the major class of transposable genetic elements in mammals and comprise around 37.5&#x00025; of the mouse genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000199-Mouse1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. To allow new transposition events to propagate through subsequent generations, retrotransposons have evolved to be active in the germline. Accordingly, germ cells appear to have evolved mechanisms to reduce the mutational load of retrotransposon activity. Mutations in genes involved in mediating DNA methylation-dependent transcriptional repression of retrotransposons cause increased expression of retrotransposons and defects in chromosome synapsis during meiosis in either male or female germ cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000199-DeLaFuente1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000199-Bourchis1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. For example Dnmt3L is a catalytically inactive member of the DNA methyltransferase family that is expressed in foetal germ cells but is absent by 6 days post partum (dpp) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000199-Bourchis1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Male mice null for this gene do not methylate dispersed repeat DNA during foetal germ cell development, and express LINEs and a class of endogenous retroviruses known as intracisternal A-particles (IAPs) in the germline <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000199-Bourchis1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. <italic>Dnmt3L</italic> mutant male mice also exhibit meiotic abnormalities that result in a loss of post-meiotic germ cells in the testis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000199-Bourchis1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. The <italic>Dnmt3L</italic> mutant phenotype suggests that epigenetic changes that occur in foetal germ cells can cause meiotic defects later in germ cell development. A second example is provided by the murine piwi-related genes, which encode germline-specific proteins that are associated with a class of small germline-specific piwi-interacting RNAs (piRNAs) and are also required to repress retrotransposons during spermatogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000199-Aravin1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000199-KuramochiMiyagawa1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. <italic>Mili</italic> and <italic>Miwi2</italic> both appear to be involved in de novo methylation of LINE and IAP elements during germ cell development in male embryos, and both mutants exhibit reduced DNA methylation and increased expression of LINE and IAP element in the testis, and defects in chromosome synapsis during meiosis in male germ cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000199-Aravin1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000199-KuramochiMiyagawa1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. The mechanism by which increased expression of retrotransposons results in the defects in chromosome synapsis seen in these mutant mice is unknown, but the phenotype of these mutant mice suggests that repression of transposable genetic elements is required to allow germ cells to progress through meiosis.</p><p>A set of testis expressed (<italic>Tex</italic>) genes has been identified in a subtractive hybridisation screen for genes expressed in spermatogonia but not somatic tissue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000199-Wang1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>.

The appearance of DNA double strand breaks and the formation of early recombination foci during meiotic prophase can be detected by immunostaining for the phosphorylated histone &#x003b3;H2AX and the recombinase enzyme Rad51 respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000199-Mahadevaiah1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000199-Barlow1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. &#x003b3;H2AX staining is normally present on chromatin during the leptotene and zygotene stages of early meiotic prophase. As synapsis proceeds during zygotene, the DNA double strand breaks are resolved, resulting in &#x003b3;H2AX staining disappearing from the autosomal chromosomes, but not the sex chromosomes.

Similarly, immunostaining for the early recombination foci marker Rad51, which largely disappears from autosomal chromosomes as synapsis proceeds, suggests that Rad51 foci are formed in <italic>Tex19.1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> knockout spermatocytes, but are not resolved or matured on the unsynapsed chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000199-g005">Figure 5G, H</xref>). Thus the formation of DNA double strand breaks and the assembly of early recombination foci both appear to be occurring in <italic>Tex19.1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> knockout spermatocytes.

In our study we have shown that Tex19.1 is predominantly cytoplasmic in embryonic stem cells by immunostaining and by Western blotting of subcellular fractions. We have also shown that Tex19.1 has a predominantly cytoplasmic localisation in germ cells by immunostaining germ cells isolated from embryonic testes, by immunohistochemistry on wax sections of adult testis and by Western blotting of subcellular fractions from prepubertal testes. Furthermore we have demonstrated the specificity of our antibody in the assays that we use by immunostaining and Western blotting on material from <italic>Tex19.1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> knockout animals.

Increased transposition of mobile genetic elements could introduce quantitative, qualitative, or temporal changes in the DNA double strand breaks normally present during early meiotic prophase that could interfere with the homologous recombination events that normally precede and initiate chromosome pairing. Support for this model comes from the observation that mutating genes involved in piRNA function in flies activates the DNA damage signalling pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000199-Chen1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000199-Klattenhoff1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. Alternatively, it is possible that repression of retrotransposons is important for the fidelity of homolog pairing and synapsis during meiosis, and that increased expression of these repetitive elements either interferes with homolog recognition and synapsis, or promotes pairing between non-homologous chromosomes. A third possibility is that proteins encoded by the MMERVK10C endogenous retrovirus mediate the defects in meiotic chromosome synapsis by interfering with host cell proteins involved in meiotic chromosome behaviour or regulation of the meiotic cell cycle. In this regard it is important to note that transgenic mice expressing the rec protein derived from the HERVK human endogenous retrovirus exhibit defects in spermatogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000199-Galli1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>.

The upregulation of MMERVK10C transcripts could be caused by changes acting at any level of gene expression from the initiation of transcription to mRNA turnover. We have not been able to find any difference in the level of DNA methylation at MMERVK10C elements in <italic>Tex19.1</italic> mutant testes. This provides further evidence that <italic>Tex19.1</italic> belongs to a different genetic pathway than <italic>Miwi2</italic>, <italic>Mili</italic> and <italic>Dnmt3L</italic> for repression of retrotransposons in the germline.

An alternative model to explain the upregulation of MMERVK10C elements in <italic>Tex19.1</italic> mutant testes is that Tex19.1 could be a transcriptional repressor of MMERVK10C elements. The nuclear localisation of Tex19.1 reported by Kuntz et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000199-Kuntz1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref> would be consistent with this type of mechanism operating. However, although we cannot exclude the possibility that some Tex19.1 acts in the nucleus in the germ cells in the adult testes, our finding that Tex19.1 is predominantly cytoplasmic in these cells would be more consistent with Tex19.1 acting to regulate gene expression at a post-transcriptional level. We are able to detect MMERVK10C transcripts in wild-type testes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000199-g006">Figure 6B,G</xref>) suggesting that some MMERVK10C transcripts must escape DNA methylation or transcriptional repression, and that post-transcriptional regulation of MMERVK10C mRNA may play a role in repressing the activity of this retrotransposon. The upregulation of MMERVK10C transcripts in <italic>Tex19.1</italic> mutant testes does not appear to be the result of changes in RNA splicing as the MMERVK10C isoforms present in <italic>Tex19.1</italic> mutant testes do not appear to be qualitatively different from those present in wild-type testes. However, the accumulation of MMERVK10C transcripts in <italic>Tex19.1</italic> knockout testes would be consistent with <italic>Tex19.1</italic> promoting degradation of MMERVK10C mRNA.

Although there is good genetic evidence that the piwi class of proteins is involved in transcriptional repression of retrotransposons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000199-Aravin1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000199-KuramochiMiyagawa1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, there is also good biochemical evidence that piwi proteins and piRNAs are physically associated with the translational machinery in male germ cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000199-Grivna1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000199-Grivna2">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>, suggesting a role in translation or mRNA turnover. Thus piRNA-mediated repression of retrotransposons may be working at multiple levels of gene expression in male germ cells. It will be informative to investigate whether the <italic>Tex19.1</italic> pathway for repression of retrotransposons that we describe here also utilises piRNAs to target repression to MMERVK10C elements.</p><p>One of the interesting aspects of the <italic>Tex19.1</italic> phenotype is that although the MMERVK10C subclass of retrotransposons is upregulated in <italic>Tex19.1</italic> mutant testes, LINE, SINE and IAP retrotransposons are not. It is not clear how <italic>Tex19.1</italic> determines specificity for the MMERVK10C element. Notably, IAP elements belong to the same subclass of endogenous retroviruses as MMERVK10C elements (class II LTR retrotransposons) but are not upregulated in <italic>Tex19.1</italic> mutant testes. Sequences within the MMERVK10C promoter or transcript could be involved in targeting <italic>Tex19.1</italic> activity to this element. Alternatively <italic>Tex19.1</italic> may have the potential to regulate a wider range of retrotransposons than we have been able to identify here, but alternative mechanisms to repress retrotransposon expression during spermatogenesis, such as DNA methylation, may limit the phenotypic effects of losing <italic>Tex19.1</italic> to a subset of its potential targets. Furthermore, as <italic>Tex19.1</italic> expression is not restricted to spermatogenesis but also occurs in primordial germ cells, oocytes and pluripotent stem cells, it will be of interest to determine if <italic>Tex19.1</italic> is involved in repressing MMERVK10C elements and other classes of retrotransposons in these cell types.</p><p>In addition to its role in the germline, <italic>Tex19.1</italic> is also expressed in pluripotent cells. Like germ cells, pluripotent cells are viable targets for retrotransposon activity as any new transposition events could be propagated through successive generations. Therefore pluripotent cells presumably also need to modulate retrotransposon activity to ensure that the mutational load on the genome is not too high. Our finding that <italic>Tex19.1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> homozygotes are born at a sub-Mendelian frequency is consistent with a role for <italic>Tex19.1</italic> in pluripotent cells in early embryonic development. Further work is required to determine whether the loss of <italic>Tex19.1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> homozygotes during embryogenesis is caused by defects in pluripotent cells, and whether pluripotent cells upregulate retrotransposon expression in <italic>Tex19.1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> knockout embryos.</p><p>The ongoing battle between retrotransposons and the host genome has important consequences for evolution, and for genetic disease. Retrotransposons that can successfully evade genome defences in germ cells and pluripotent cells will be selected for during evolution, whereas germ cells and pluripotent cells are under selective pressure to keep the mutational load on the genome at sustainable levels. The striking differences in the relative abundance of different classes of retrotransposable elements between the mouse and human genomes suggest that this conflict is ongoing during mammalian evolution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000199-Mouse1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Although low levels of mutation and retrotransposition in the germline are required to generate the genetic variation essential for evolution, high levels of mutation or retrotransposition are deleterious to the survival of a species. In humans, endogenous retroviruses with intact coding sequences comprise a very small proportion of the genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000199-International1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>, yet intact endogenous retroviral particles are found in human pluripotent stem cells, and in testicular germ cell tumours where the expression of endogenous retroviral proteins has been suggested to contribute to tumourigenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000199-Lower1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000199-Galli1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000199-Bronson1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, a number of human genetic diseases are associated with de novo mutagenic retrotransposition events that disrupt the function of endogenous human genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000199-Maksakova1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000199-Chen2">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>. Our data suggests that <italic>Tex19.1</italic> is part of a mechanism that protects the genome from the deleterious effects of retrotransposon activity in the germline, and thereby helps to maintain genomic stability through successive generations.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pgen.1000199.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Validation of anti-Tex19.1 antibody specificity.
