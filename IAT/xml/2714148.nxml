Patient groups were acute inflammatory arthritis, acute knee injury, chronic knee injury and knee osteoarthritis (OA).

There are five known aggrecanase cleavage sites in aggrecan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The most severe aggrecanase cleavage in terms of destructive loss of sulfated glycosaminoglycan (sGAG) from the tissue, is at the <sup>392</sup>Glu-<sup>393</sup>Ala bond in the interglobular (IGD) domain of aggrecan, releasing N-terminal <sup>393</sup>ARGS neoepitope fragments.</p><p>ARGS neoepitope aggrecan fragments released into the SF, as detected by western blot or amino acid sequencing, have been associated with joint diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and have also been detected as a result of normal turnover [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].

The work presented here confirms that aggrecanase cleavage in the IGD is a major contributor to aggrecan degradation in human joint pathology, and extends our understanding of the relative contribution of aggrecanase activity in different human joint diseases. We found greatly increased SF concentrations of aggrecan ARGS fragments in several different joint diseases compared with the healthy knee reference group, differences that were only to a small extent reflected by enhanced concentrations of aggrecan fragments in general or sulfated glycosaminoglycans. We also found that the elevation in SF ARGS concentration was most dramatic early after a knee injury, and then decreased to lower levels 12 weeks after the injury, albeit still significantly different from the healthy knee reference group. This suggests that the enhanced aggrecan cleavage in the IGD by aggrecanase caused by the acute joint insult remains increased for several years. Similar long-term changes after knee injury in SF levels of stromelysin (MMP-3) have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><sec><title>Study design and methodology</title><p>The range of ARGS concentrations within each study group was substantial, with the exception of the healthy knee reference group.

However, it is also known that the variability of SF markers is greater than for serum and urine markers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Despite the considerable range observed, we note that all study groups differed significantly from the reference group regarding ARGS concentrations. Based on previous studies it is most likely that the knee injury groups are not homogenous regarding progression of OA, but are comprised of progressors and non-progressors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. It is plausible that heterogeneities like these also influence the ARGS concentrations, and could partly explain the variations seen in these groups.</p><p>The lower limit of linearity of the ARGS ELISA in SF was 1 pmol/ml SF, and samples below this level were assigned half that value to allow statistical analysis.

The weaker immuno-reaction seen for SF ARGS fragments captured by the ELISA plate, compared with fragments captured from the standard, is most likely a reflection of a lower total ARGS concentration in these SFs compared with the standards.</p><p>The strategy applied in the ARGS ELISA of capturing fragments with the anti-KS antibody limits detection of ARGS fragments to those also containing part of the KS domain. Although there are known cleavage sites for proteases such as MMPs, cathepsins, and calpains between <sup>393</sup>ARGS and the KS domain stretching from amino acid 676 to 848, these cleavage sites were all confirmed to occur by <italic>in vitro </italic>experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]; Sandy and Verscharen showed in SF the presence of a 100 kDa ARGS band ('Species f') estimated to stretch to amino acids 800 to 900 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. We detected small amounts of a similar band in SF purified by chromatography or by associative A1 fractioning which, when deglycosylated, migrated to 50 to 70 kDa; the intensity of the band corresponded to about 3% of the total ARGS signal (data not shown). By use of a calculation model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], we estimate these <sup>393</sup>ARGS fragments to stretch to amino acids 690 to 750 (data not shown).

Even so, the ARGS neoepitope concentrations correlated with both sGAG and 1-F21 aggrecan concentrations in SF, consistent with previous findings showing that a significant portion of the sGAG and aggrecan content in human SF consisted of neoepitope fragments such as the ARGS fragments measured here, or MMP-generated <sup>361</sup>FFGV fragments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. The differences in group median values of ARGS were, however, much greater than for either sGAG or 1-F21 aggrecan.

With specificities of 91 to 92%, the concentration of ARGS neoepitope fragments had a sensitivity of 67% in differentiating diseased from healthy patients, compared with sGAG or 1-F21 aggrecan, which had lower sensitivities of 40% and 32%, respectively. Quantification in SF of ARGS fragments generated by aggrecanases by a neoepitope-specific ELISA is clearly a more powerful tool to distinguish diseased and injured joints from healthy than quantification of aggrecan fragments either by 1-F21 ELISA or by measuring sGAG concentrations.</p></sec><sec><title>Proportion of aggrecan detected as ARGS neoepitope</title><p>Acknowledging that there are uncertainties in our assumptions of molecular weight and degree of glycosylation of the average aggrecan fragment in SF, and of the molecular weight of the standard, uncertainties that make ARGS proportions of aggrecan greater than 100% possible, the diagnostic groups nevertheless showed large differences in the proportion of SF aggrecan fragments generated by aggrecanase IGD activity. In the two groups most strongly associated with high joint disease activity, acute inflammatory arthritis and acute knee injury, a majority of the aggrecan fragments were indeed shown to be the result of aggrecanase IGD activity, whereas the other groups had much lower proportions. These results corroborate those previously obtained by western blots [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Interpretation of elevated SF levels of ARGS</title><p>Based solely on data available in this paper, the elevated SF levels of ARGS in disease, particularly in the acute inflammatory arthritis and acute injury samples, could be explained by enhanced aggrecanase activity against aggrecan resident in the joint cartilage matrix, or against newly synthesized and secreted aggrecan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. ADAMTS-5 (aggrecanase-2) was shown to co-localize with hyaluronan surrounding chondrocytes in both normal and osteoarthritic cartilage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. However, if enhanced synthesis of aggrecan in combination with aggrecanase activity were to explain the enhanced SF levels of ARGS, an equal increase in the SF levels of G3 was to be expected. This is not the case; we have in quantitative western blot analysis of 30 of these samples seen no significant difference in SF levels of G3 of any of the diagnostic groups compared with healthy knee references [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. We therefore suggest that an increased aggrecanase activity against the IGD domain of resident aggrecan best explains the enhanced SF levels of ARGS seen in these diagnostic groups.</p></sec><sec><title>The source of the aggrecan fragments</title><p>SF is more proximate to the location of joint cartilage and aggrecan degradation than serum or urine, and may therefore better reflect local pathologic processes in the joint being studied.

The enhanced aggrecanase IGD cleavage is detectable by ELISA as ARGS fragments in the SF. We show that measuring SF concentrations of ARGS is more sensitive in distinguishing diseased and injured joints from healthy ones than methods that do not rely on the specific detection of this aggrecan neoepitope. The ARGS ELISA could be used to monitor aggrecanase activity in joint disease, and to monitor the efficacy of interventions to inhibit this protease activity in joint disease or model systems.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>AA: acute inflammatory arthritis; ACL: anterior cruciate ligament; ADAMTS: a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs; AEBSF: 4-(2-aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride; AI: acute knee injury; BSA: bovine serum albumin; CI: chronic knee injury; CV: coefficient of variation; EACA: 6-aminohexonic acid; EDTA: ethylenediaminetetra acetic acid; ELISA: enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>: hydrogen peroxidase; IGD: interglobular domain; KS: keratan sulfate; mAb: monoclonal antibody; MEN: meniscal injury; MES: 2-(N-morpholino) ethanesulfonic acid; MMP: matrix metalloproteases; NEM: N-ethylmaleimide; OA: osteoarthritis; PBST: phosphate buffered saline with TWEEN; PMSF: phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride; PVDF: polyvinylidene difluoride; REF: healthy knee reference; SF: synovial fluid; sGAG: sulfated glycosaminoglycan; TMB: tetramethylbenzidine.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>SL participated in the design of the study, carried out the modification of the ARGS ELISA, the acquisition of data and the analysis and interpretation thereof, and was primarily responsible for writing the manuscript.
