They also show similarities to Ntrk neurotrophin receptors in their carboxy-termini, sharing a conserved tyrosine residue. Among 6 <italic>Slitrk</italic> family genes in mammals, <italic>Slitrk6</italic> has a unique expression pattern, with strong expression in the sensory epithelia of the inner ear. We generated <italic>Slitrk6</italic>-knockout mice and investigated the development of their auditory and vestibular sensory organs. <italic>Slitrk6</italic>-deficient mice showed pronounced reduction in the cochlear innervation. In the vestibule, the innervation to the posterior crista was often lost, reduced, or sometimes misguided. These defects were accompanied by the loss of neurons in the spiral and vestibular ganglia. Cochlear sensory epithelia from <italic>Slitrk6</italic>-knockout mice have reduced ability in promoting neurite outgrowth of spiral ganglion neurons. Indeed the <italic>Slitrk6</italic>-deficient inner ear showed a mild but significant decrease in the expression of <italic>Bdnf</italic> and <italic>Ntf3</italic>, both of which are essential for the innervation and survival of sensory neurons. In addition, the expression of Ntrk receptors, including their phosphorylated forms was decreased in <italic>Slitrk6</italic>-knockout cochlea. These results suggest that Slitrk6 promotes innervation and survival of inner ear sensory neurons by regulating the expression of trophic and/or tropic factors including neurotrophins from sensory epithelia.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The Slitrk family consists of neuronal transmembrane proteins that control neurite outgrowth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007786-Aruga1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007786-Aruga2">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

Histological examination and marker labeling studies revealed a reduction in the innervation density in the cochlea of <italic>Slitrk6</italic>-deficient mice. In addition, the innervation to the posterior crista was lost, reduced, or sometimes misguided in the vestibule. Many sensory neurons within the spiral and vestibular ganglia were lost during development. In the explant co-culture experiment, cochlear sensory epithelia from <italic>Slitrk6</italic>-knockout mice had less activity in promoting neurite outgrowth of the spiral ganglion neurons.

ErbB2 and ErbB3 are highly expressed in the supporting cells of the organ of Corti and regulate the expression of neurotrophins, especially <italic>Ntf3</italic>.

Therefore, these genes may not function downstream of Slitrk6 during inner ear development.</p><p>Besides the strong expression in the sensory epithelia, Slitrk6 is also expressed in ganglion neurons weakly and transiently. However, isolated spiral ganglia of <italic>Slitrk6</italic>-knockout mice can extend their neurites almost the same as those of wild-type mice in a tissue culture experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007786-g008">Fig. 8A, B, E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007786.s008">Fig. S7</xref>). Although we cannot exclude the possibility that Slitrk6 expressed in ganglion neurons play some roles in target recognition or axon pathfinding, we consider that the observed abnormalities of <italic>Slitrk6</italic>-knockout mice are mainly attributed to the loss of Slitrk6 in sensory epithelia. Interestingly, previous studies have also reported the transient expression of neurotrophins in the inner ear ganglia, similar to the expression of Slitrk6 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007786-Farinas1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007786-Schecterson1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>.

On the basis of its spatial distribution, we believe that Slitrk6 is localized in the delaminating cells, where it could participate in the neuronal organization of the inner ear and provides guidance as shown in the derailed pathfinding of posterior crista projections.</p><p>In conclusion, our results indicate that Slitrk6 is involved in the survival and innervation of sensory neurons in the inner ear, at least in part by modulating neurotrophin&#x02013;Ntrk signaling.
