Transcription complex displacement is an ATP-dependent reaction that is thought to involve DNA translocation without the strand separation associated with classical helicase activity. We have identified single amino acid substitutions within Mfd that disrupt the ability of Mfd to displace RNA polymerase but do not prevent ATP hydrolysis or binding to DNA. These substitutions, or deletion of the C-terminal 209 residues of Mfd, abrogate the ability of Mfd to increase the efficiency of roadblock repression <italic>in vivo</italic>. The substitutions fall in a region of Mfd that is homologous to the &#x02018;TRG&#x02019; motif of RecG, a protein that catalyses ATP-dependent translocation of Holliday junctions. Our results define a translocation motif in Mfd and suggest that Mfd and RecG couple ATP hydrolysis to translocation of DNA in a similar manner.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>DNA is subjected to a continuous barrage of assaults from endogenous and exogenous sources, and cells employ a wide range of enzyme activities to recognise and repair DNA damage and thus ensure the integrity of the genetic material. DNA damage within genes that are being transcribed is prioritised by transcription&#x02013;repair coupling pathways: lesions that occur in the transcribed strand and cause RNA polymerase (RNAP) to stall are repaired &#x0223c;10-fold more rapidly than similar damage in the bulk DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg868c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg868c2">2</xref>). The process is mediated by transcription&#x02013;repair coupling factors that displace the stalled RNAP from the site of damage, and interact with repair proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg868c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg868c4">4</xref>).</p><p>The bacterial transcription&#x02013;repair coupling factor is the Mfd protein, which binds to stalled transcription elongation complexes <italic>in vitro</italic> and catalyses their dissociation from template DNA in an ATP-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg868c5">5</xref>). Sequence analysis indicates that Mfd contains superfamily II helicase motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg868c5">5</xref>). These are essential for the RNAP displacement activity of Mfd (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg868c6">6</xref>), but Mfd does not possess conventional strand-separating helicase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg868c7">7</xref>). In order to displace RNAP, Mfd requires &#x0223c;20 bp of accessible DNA upstream of the region bound by RNAP but little or no DNA downstream of RNAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg868c8">8</xref>). Mfd is also able to &#x02018;rescue&#x02019; elongation complexes that have become backtracked, allowing them to resume transcription. In backtracked complexes, the 3&#x02032; end of the nascent transcript has been extruded from the active site through backwards translocation of RNAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg868c8">8</xref>). Transcription elongation factors GreA and GreB rescue backtracked complexes by causing the extruded 3&#x02032; end of the transcript to be cleaved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg868c9">9</xref>), but Mfd appears to directly reverse the backtracking process by causing the stalled RNAP to move forward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg868c8">8</xref>).</p><p>These results support a model in which ATP hydrolysis by Mfd is coupled to dissociation of RNAP by translocation of double-stranded DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg868c8">8</xref>). At stalled elongation complexes, an Mfd molecule interacts with RNAP and with the region of DNA immediately upstream of the complex. If transcription is blocked by a DNA lesion, or by a protein bound to the DNA in front of the polymerase, translocation by Mfd results in dissociation of RNAP. In the case of backtracked complexes, the translocation results in realignment of the 3&#x02032; end of the transcript and resumption of transcription.</p><p>Double-stranded DNA translocation is thought to be important for a range of processes including chromatin remodelling, DNA replication and DNA cleavage by type I restriction enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg868c10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg868c12">12</xref>). One of the best characterised DNA translocases is the bacterial RecG protein, which is involved in the rescue of stalled replication forks and can catalyse branch migration of a Holliday junction structure <italic>in vitro</italic> in an ATP-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg868c13">13</xref>). The region of Mfd encompassing the helicase motifs shares a high degree of sequence identity with the helicase motifs of RecG (38&#x00025; identity between 378 residues of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> Mfd and the corresponding region of <italic>E.coli</italic> RecG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg868c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg868c14">14</xref>). The crystal structure of a <italic>Thermatoga maritima</italic> RecG-ADP&#x02013;DNA complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg868c12">12</xref>) reveals that RecG consists of three domains: an N-terminal domain, which binds to the replication fork, and two C-terminal domains, which contain superfamily II helicase motifs. It is proposed that ATP hydrolysis by RecG results in translocation of double-stranded DNA by domains 2 and 3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg868c12">12</xref>), and it is these domains that contain the region of homology to Mfd.</p><p>Substitutions that prevent DNA translocation by RecG have recently been identified in the region immediately downstream of helicase motif VI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg868c14">14</xref>). These substitutions fall in a helical hairpin motif and an adjacent surface-exposed loop that was not defined in the RecG crystal structure. This region was termed the TRG (<underline>t</underline>ranslocation in <underline>R</underline>ec<underline>G</underline>) motif. On the basis of Mfd:RecG sequence alignments, it was proposed that Mfd also contains a TRG motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg868c14">14</xref>) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg868f1">1</xref>). In this study, we show that the putative TRG motif in Mfd is essential for Mfd-mediated displacement of RNAP, but is not essential for ATP-dependent DNA binding. We also show that Mfd increases the efficiency of roadblock repression of transcription <italic>in vivo</italic>, and that residues within the TRG motif are required for this function.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Strains and plasmids</title><p>The <italic>mfd</italic><sup><italic>&#x0002b;</italic></sup><italic>E.coli</italic> K-12 strain AB1157 was obtained from the <italic>E.coli</italic> Genetic Stock Centre, Yale University.

This fragment encodes a transcript in which UTP must be incorporated at &#x0002b;2 and &#x0002b;21. Transcription elongation complexes stalled at &#x0002b;20 could therefore be formed by using the dinucleotide ApU to initiate transcription and excluding UTP from the transcription reaction.

Regulated formation of protein roadblocks is involved in carbon catabolite repression of the <italic>hut</italic> and <italic>gnt</italic> operons in <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg868c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg868c26">26</xref>), and catabolite repression of these operons is partially relieved in <italic>mfd</italic><sup><italic>&#x02013;</italic></sup> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg868c27">27</xref>). It has been proposed that the Mfd dependence of roadblock repression in <italic>B.subtilis</italic> is the result of Mfd-mediated displacement of RNAP paused at roadblock sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg868c27">27</xref>). We established an <italic>in vivo</italic> assay to test this model in <italic>E.coli</italic> and to provide an Mfd-dependent phenotype that could be readily monitored.</p><p>The rationale for the assay is shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg868f2">2</xref>. Lac repressor&#x02013;operator interactions are sufficient to cause roadblock repression both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>, although roadblock repression is less efficient than repression of the <italic>lacP1</italic> promoter by promoter occlusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg868c28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg868c31">31</xref>). We constructed a reporter vector, pRCB-CAT1, in which roadblock repression by Lac repressor protein controlled expression of the <italic>cat</italic> gene. In order to maximise the level of roadblock repression, we placed one optimal <italic>lac</italic> operator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg868c17">17</xref>) upstream of the <italic>cat</italic> gene, and a second optimal <italic>lac</italic> operator downstream of the <italic>cat</italic> gene. The two operators were separated by 815 bp (centre-to-centre), a distance at which simultaneous binding of the two operators by a single Lac repressor tetramer would be expected to increase occupancy of the upstream operator &#x0223c;2-fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg868c32">32</xref>) without introducing a second roadblock between the promoter and the reporter gene. Expression of the <italic>cat</italic> gene was driven by a constitutive derivative of the <italic>galP1</italic> promoter, located 64 bp upstream of the centre of the upstream <italic>lac</italic> operator. Lac repressor bound to the upstream <italic>lac</italic> operator was expected to block the progress of RNAP and decrease transcription of the <italic>cat</italic> gene. If Mfd displaces transcription complexes stalled by protein roadblocks <italic>in vivo</italic>, as it does <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg868c7">7</xref>), it should increase the likelihood that the stalled RNAP dissociates from the DNA before Lac repressor does, decreasing transcription of the <italic>cat</italic> gene still further. The Lac repressor roadblock should therefore repress transcription more effectively when Mfd is present than when Mfd is absent.</p><p>To determine the effectiveness of this roadblock repression system in the absence of Mfd, an <italic>mfd</italic><sup>&#x02013;</sup> strain, UNCNOMFD, was transformed with the roadblock repression reporter vector and a plasmid carrying the <italic>lacI</italic><sup><italic>Q</italic></sup> gene encoding Lac repressor. Cultures of this strain were grown to mid-exponential phase in the presence or absence of IPTG, and CAT activities were measured (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkg868tb1">1</xref>). The CAT activity in the absence of IPTG (when Lac repressor should be bound to operator DNA) was 9.5-fold lower than that in the presence of IPTG (when Lac repressor should not be bound to operator DNA). Lac repressor bound downstream of the transcription start site therefore repressed transcription of the <italic>cat</italic> gene 9.5-fold in this system, presumably by acting as a block to transcription elongation.</p><p>To determine the effect of Mfd on roadblock repression in this system, the experiment was repeated using UNCNOMFD (<italic>mfd</italic><sup>&#x02013;</sup>) cells transformed with the roadblock repression reporter vector and a plasmid carrying the wild-type <italic>mfd</italic> gene in addition to <italic>lacI</italic><sup><italic>Q</italic></sup> (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkg868tb1">1</xref>). In these cells, the CAT activity in the absence of IPTG was 61-fold lower than that in its presence. Comparison with the results obtained in cells that lacked Mfd reveals that Mfd decreased the induced (&#x0002b;IPTG) level of CAT expression only slightly, and caused a much greater decrease in the repressed (&#x02013;IPTG) level of CAT expression.

In accordance with previously published work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg868c6">6</xref>), wild-type Mfd only formed a stable complex in the presence of ATP&#x003b3;S. Mfd RA953, HL948 and QA963 also formed stable complexes in the presence of ATP&#x003b3;S but, in contrast to wild-type Mfd, these mutant proteins formed a significant amount of stable complex in the presence of ATP. This ATP-induced complex had a higher electrophoretic mobility than the complex formed in the presence of ATP&#x003b3;S, suggesting that the two complexes differ in character. Mfd RA929 did not form a stable complex in the presence of ATP, and the complex formed by Mfd RA929 in the presence of ATP&#x003b3;S resembled that formed by the other mutants in the presence of ATP.</p><p>The observation that all four Mfd derivatives carrying substitutions in the TRG motif bound DNA stably in the presence of ATP&#x003b3;S, but not in the absence of nucleotides, confirmed that they were able to bind ATP and suggested that the substitutions did not grossly affect the overall fold of the protein. We assayed the ATPase activity of our purified Mfd proteins at saturating ATP concentration in the absence of DNA. Under these conditions, all four of the Mfd derivatives carrying substitutions in the TRG motif hydrolysed ATP at the same rate, within the error of the experiment (data not shown). Wild-type Mfd presumably does not bind DNA stably in the presence of ATP because hydrolysis of ATP causes Mfd to be lost from the fragment. This might occur either by a simple conformational change induced by ATP hydrolysis or product release, or through ATP-driven DNA translocation. The ability of Mfd RA953, HL948, and QA963 to form stable complexes in the presence of ATP might therefore result either from defects in the ATP hydrolysis cycle that were too subtle to be detected in our ATPase assay, or an inability to couple ATP hydrolysis to DNA translocation or release.</p></sec><sec><title>Substitutions in the TRG motif disrupt Mfd-mediated displacement of RNAP <italic>in vitro</italic></title><p>The ability of purified mutant Mfd proteins to displace stalled transcription complexes <italic>in vitro</italic> was assayed by EMSAs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg868f5">5</xref>). Plasmid pAR1707 contains the T7 A1 promoter, and elongation complexes initiating from this promoter can be stalled at &#x0002b;20 by excluding UTP from a reaction mixture that contains all other components necessary for transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg868c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg868c33">33</xref>). Experiments using <sup>32</sup>P-labelled template DNA were used to detect transcription initiation complexes, transcription elongation complexes and DNA to which RNAP had not bound (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg868f5">5</xref>A), and experiments in which <sup>32</sup>P-labelled nucleotides were incorporated into the nascent transcript were used to detect transcription elongation complexes specifically (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg868f5">5</xref>B). Initiation complexes and stalled elongation complexes were distinguished on the basis of their differing mobility during acrylamide gel electrophoresis (e.g. compare lanes 2 and 4 in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg868f5">5</xref>A). Initiation complexes migrated as a single band, and were less stable than elongation complexes under our electrophoresis conditions. Elongation complexes migrated faster than the initiation complex, and several minor species were detected in addition to the major band (e.g. lane 4 in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg868f5">5</xref>A and lane 2 in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg868f5">5</xref>B). Previous studies using this template indicate that the fainter, faster moving bands correspond to elongation complexes that contain transcripts shorter than 20 nucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg868c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg868c33">33</xref>).</p><p>As described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg868c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg868c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg868c8">8</xref>), addition of wild-type Mfd to a reaction mixture containing stalled elongation complexes resulted in the complete dissociation of all elongation complexes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg868f5">5</xref>A, compare lanes 4 and 5; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg868f5">5</xref>B, compare lanes 1 and 2). Analysis of samples taken at timed intervals after the addition of Mfd revealed that &#x0003e;90&#x00025; of the elongation complexes were displaced from the DNA within 5 min (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg868f5">5</xref>C). In contrast, Mfd RA953 and Mfd QA963 were unable to displace any elongation complexes, even after 20 min incubation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg868f5">5</xref>C). However, in reactions containing Mfd RA953 or Mfd QA963, the transcription elongation complex band was &#x02018;supershifted&#x02019; (i.e. its mobility was decreased; compare lanes 2, 3 and 6 in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg868f5">5</xref>B; supershifting by QA963 is also evident in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg868f5">5</xref>A).

As both Mfd RA953 and QA963 bound naked DNA non-specifically under the conditions of these assays (note the shifting of the fragment band in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg868f5">5</xref>A, and see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg868f4">4</xref>), it is not clear whether the supershifted elongation complexes involved Mfd&#x02013;RNAP&#x02013;DNA interactions or solely Mfd&#x02013;DNA interactions.</p><p>Mfd RA929 and Mfd HL948 were able to displace stalled elongation complexes, but did so at a rate that was considerably slower than wild-type Mfd (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg868f5">5</xref>C). In samples taken before the elongation complex was displaced, Mfd HL948 caused a supershift of the elongation complex band (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg868f5">5</xref>A, lane 17, and Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg868f5">5</xref>B, lane 5) but no supershifted intermediate was observed in reactions containing Mfd RA929. As these substitutions impaired, rather than abolished, the ability of Mfd to displace RNAP from DNA, we conclude that Mfd residues R929 and H948 contribute to the displacement process but are not essential for it.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>We have shown that Mfd increases the efficiency of roadblock repression <italic>in vivo</italic> in <italic>E.coli</italic>, as observed previously in <italic>B.subtilis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg868c27">27</xref>). Mfd proteins in which the RNAP displacement activity was disabled by deletion or single substitutions were unable to increase the efficiency of roadblock repression, and in some cases could impair the ability of co-expressed wild-type Mfd to do so. The simplest explanation of these data is that in wild-type cells, Mfd displaces a high proportion of transcription complexes that are stalled by protein roadblocks before the repressor protein dissociates from the DNA. In addition to its role in roadblock repression, Mfd is able to revive backtracked elongation complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg868c8">8</xref>), and is responsible for RNAP release during transcription termination by the phage &#x003bb; Nun protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg868c34">34</xref>). It is increasingly apparent that Mfd plays a more general role in the regulation of transcription elongation than simply mediating transcription-coupled repair.</p><p>Mfd couples ATP hydrolysis to movement of DNA&#x02013;RNAP complexes, and RecG couples ATP hydrolysis to movement of specific DNA structures. Both proteins therefore require a &#x02018;motor&#x02019; domain. Sequence alignment of the two proteins revealed that, in addition to conserved superfamily II helicase motifs, they share an area of high sequence identity that includes a helical hairpin motif termed the TRG motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg868c14">14</xref>). As mutational analysis indicated that residues within this motif were important for DNA translocation by RecG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg868c14">14</xref>), it was likely that the TRG motif would also be important for the function of Mfd. We tested this hypothesis by making single amino acid substitutions at the residues within Mfd that correspond to the key residues in the TRG motif of RecG (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg868f1">1</xref>). All of these substitutions caused defects in Mfd.</p><p>Alanine substitutions of R953 and Q963 abolished the ability of Mfd to displace stalled transcription elongation complexes <italic>in vitro</italic>, and produced Mfd derivatives that were unable to complement an <italic>mfd</italic> deletion mutant <italic>in vivo</italic>. These residues therefore appear to play essential roles in the mechanism by which Mfd dissociates RNAP from DNA. Substitution of R929 or H948 impaired the RNAP displacement activity of Mfd <italic>in vitro</italic>, but proteins containing these substitutions retained sufficient activity to complement an <italic>mfd</italic> deletion mutant <italic>in vivo</italic>. The DNA and ATP binding activities of all four mutants appeared to be intact. The &#x02018;hierachy&#x02019; of effects of TRG substitutions in Mfd mirrored that observed in RecG: substitutions of equivalent residues caused defects of equivalent magnitude in both proteins. In Mfd, alanine substitutions of R953 and Q963 caused greater defects than substitution of R929 <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro.</italic> In <italic>E.coli</italic> RecG, substitutions of R630 (equivalent to Mfd R953) and Q640 (equivalent to Mfd Q963) had a greater effect on the <italic>in vivo</italic> role of RecG in UV tolerance than substitutions of R609 (equivalent to Mfd R929), and substitutions of R630 caused greater defects in RecG helicase and ATPase activity <italic>in vitro</italic> than substitutions of R609 (the effects of RecG Q640 substitutions <italic>in vitro</italic> have not been reported) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg868c14">14</xref>). We conclude that the TRG motif of Mfd is essential for Mfd-mediated displacement of stalled RNAP, and that Mfd couples ATP hydrolysis to RNAP displacement via a mechanism very similar to that used by RecG to drive migration of Holliday junctions. Our results therefore support a model for Mfd action in which dissociation of RNAP is dependent on translocation of double-stranded DNA by Mfd.</p><p>The primary sequences of the helicase motifs and TRG motif of Mfd and RecG are highly homologous, and we constructed a model of residues 541&#x02013;983 of Mfd based on the crystal structure of residues 309&#x02013;755 of <italic>T.maritima</italic> RecG (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg868f6">6</xref>). Within this model, Mfd residues R929 and R953 are closely juxtaposed at the base of a helical hairpin, and Mfd residue Q963 falls in a surface-exposed loop that was not resolved in the RecG-ADP&#x02013;DNA crystal structure. Mfd H948, which is not conserved in RecG or in Mfd sequences from different species, falls within the helical hairpin bounded by R929 and R953, and is adjacent to D949, a highly conserved residue that is implicated in TRG function in RecG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg868c14">14</xref>). R953 is suitably located to form hydrogen bonds with D889 (a residue at the N-terminal end of a helix that extends into helicase motif VI) and with D949.</p><p>Mahdi and co-workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg868c14">14</xref>) suggested a plausible model for the generation of ATP-driven conformational change in the TRG motif, based on the crystal structure of RecG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg868c12">12</xref>). Despite differences in the size of the TRG helical hairpin, and some differences in the residues involved, this model appears to be equally applicable to Mfd. The model, adapted for Mfd, can be summarised as follows: an arginine residue at the C-terminal end of helicase motif VI interacts with the &#x003b3; phosphate of ATP. The orientation of the helix containing helicase motif VI changes during the cycle of ATP binding, hydrolysis and release, and consequently so does the pattern of hydrogen bonds made between D889 and the arginines within the TRG motif. This causes a change in the conformation of the helical hairpin structure bounded by R929 and R953, which is transmitted to the loop containing Q963.</p><p>As the path of DNA across the translocase region of RecG and Mfd is not well defined, the manner in which this series of conformational changes leads to DNA translocation remains speculative. Mahdi <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg868c14">14</xref>) have suggested that the conserved glutamine (Q640 in <italic>E.coli</italic> RecG; Q963 in <italic>E.coli</italic> Mfd) might interact directly with DNA, and that the associated surface-exposed loop might drive DNA translocation by acting as a swinging arm. Mfd QA963 retains the ability to bind DNA and it is not currently possible to state whether or not Q963 interacts with DNA during the translocation process. Our structural model of Mfd and the mechanistic model of Mahdi <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg868c14">14</xref>) offer explanations for the effects of the other Mfd substitutions tested in this work. The positively charged side chains of R929 and R953 are in close proximity, and the removal of electrostatic repulsion that would result from alanine substitution of either of these residues would probably disrupt the fold of the helical hairpin region as well as removing the hydrogen bonding link to ATP via helicase motif VI. The effect of HL948 may be direct, as it results in the removal of an ionisable side chain from the immediate vicinity of R929 and R953, or indirect, as the side chain is immediately adjacent to D949 which forms a hydrogen bond with R953 in the modelled Mfd structure. The identification of the Mfd TRG motif also explains the properties of the deletion mutant Mfd<sub>trunc</sub>, which was isolated in early studies of Mfd and found to be unable to dissociate RNAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg868c6">6</xref>): the deletion removes the C-terminal helix of the TRG helical hairpin and the loop containing Q963.</p><p>Whilst the ATP-driven motors of Mfd and RecG share a common mechanism, they appear to differ in performance. RecG is an efficient, DNA-stimulated ATPase (<italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> &#x0003e;100&#x0002f;s) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg868c13">13</xref>), but Mfd is an inefficient ATPase (<italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> &#x0223c;3&#x0002f;min) whose activity is not enhanced by DNA or by a stalled RNAP complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg868c5">5</xref>).
