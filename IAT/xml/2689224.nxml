For instance, deficiency of <italic>P. putida </italic>ColRS system results in lowered phenol tolerance, hindrance of transposition of Tn<italic>4652 </italic>and lysis of a subpopulation of glucose-grown bacteria. In order to discover molecular mechanisms behind these phenotypes, we focused here on identification of downstream components of ColRS signal transduction pathway.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>First, highly similar ColR binding sites were mapped upstream of outer membrane protein-encoding <italic>oprQ </italic>and a putative methyltransferase-encoding PP0903. These two ColR binding sequences were used as an input in computational genome-wide screening for new potential ColR recognition boxes upstream of different genes in <italic>P. putida</italic>. Biological relevance of a set of <italic>in silico </italic>predicted ColR-binding sites was analysed <italic>in vivo </italic>by studying the effect of ColR on transcription from promoters carrying these sites. This analysis disclosed seven novel genes of which six were positively and one negatively regulated by ColR. Interestingly, all promoters tested responded more significantly to the over-expression than to the absence of ColR suggesting that either ColR is limiting or ColS-activating signal is low under the conditions applied. The binding sites of ColR in the promoters analysed were validated by gel mobility shift and/or DNase I footprinting assays. ColR binding consensus was defined according to seven ColR binding motifs mapped by DNase I protection assay and this consensus was used to predict minimal regulon of ColRS system.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Combined usage of experimental and computational approach enabled us to define the binding consensus for response regulator ColR and to discover several new ColR-regulated genes. For instance, genes of outer membrane lipid A 3-O-deacylase PagL and cytoplasmic membrane diacylglycerol kinase DgkA are the members of ColR regulon. Furthermore, over 40 genes were predicted to be putatively controlled by ColRS two-component system in <italic>P. putida</italic>. It is notable that many of ColR-regulated genes encode membrane-related products thus confirming the previously proposed role of ColRS system in regulation of membrane functionality.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Two-component signal systems are the main means for sensing the changing environment in a prokaryotic world [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Typically, bacterial signal transduction systems consist of two components, a sensor histidine kinase and a response regulator. A specific compound or a physicochemical property of the environment acts as a signal triggering the activation of a membrane embedded sensor, which in turn autophosphorylates and thereafter passes the signal to a response regulator via phosphoryl group transfer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Phosphorylated response proteins mostly act as DNA binding transcription factors by activating or repressing the expression of target genes.</p><p>The number of genes for two-component proteins varies greatly between the genomes of sequenced bacteria, being for instance zero in case of <italic>Mycoplasma genitalium </italic>and 62 in a well-known model organism <italic>Escherichia coli </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The abundance of two-component systems seems to correlate with environmental and pathogenic versatility of a bacterium. <italic>Pseudomonas </italic>bacteria that colonise different habitats such as soil, water, plants and animal tissues, possess many two-component signal systems to cope with various environments. For example, over a hundreds genes encoding two-component system proteins are present in the genome of <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>The ColRS two-component signal transduction system, intrinsic to <italic>Pseudomonas </italic>species, consists of a sensor kinase ColS and a response regulator ColR. <italic>colRS </italic>operon is well-conserved among the sequenced members of <italic>Pseudomonas </italic>genus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] suggesting that ColRS system could be important to these bacteria. ColRS pathway was first characterised in <italic>P. fluorescens </italic>as a system involved in the ability of bacteria to competitively colonise plant roots [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Our group observed a totally different function for ColRS system as transposition of Tn<italic>4652 </italic>was inhibited in phenol-starving <italic>colR</italic>- and <italic>colS</italic>-deficient <italic>P. putida </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Additionally, recently, we demonstrated that <italic>colR</italic>-deficient <italic>P. putida </italic>is sensitive to phenol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and displays a serious defect on solid glucose medium where a subpopulation of the mutant lyses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. ColRS system was also shown to be important in resistance of <italic>P. putida </italic>to divalent metal ions, especially Mn<sup>2+ </sup>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Importantly, the precise checkpoint of a response regulator ColR remained unclear in case of all these ColR-dependent phenotypes. However, two recent publications suggest that seemingly unrelated phenotypes of <italic>colR</italic>-deficient <italic>P. fluorescens </italic>and <italic>P. putida </italic>can most probably be explained by the compromised cell membranes of <italic>colR </italic>mutants. Namely, the first ColR-regulated genes that were identified in these two species, encoded different membrane functions. We demonstrated that <italic>oprQ </italic>and <italic>algD</italic>, which encode a porin protein and an exopolysaccharide alginate biosynthesis enzyme, respectively, are under the direct control of ColR in <italic>P. putida </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Concomitantly, de Weert <italic>et al </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] reported for <italic>P. fluorescens </italic>that an operon downstream of <italic>colRS </italic>hypothetically coding for membrane associated proteins, methyltransferase (<italic>orf222</italic>) and lipopolysaccharide kinase (<italic>inaA/wapQ</italic>), is also regulated by ColR.</p><p>In spite of several recent studies disclosing the ColRS system as an important signal transduction pathway for pseudomonads, little is known about the downstream components of this signal system. Only two target genes of ColR have been identified in <italic>P. putida </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and our unpublished data show that neither <italic>oprQ </italic>nor <italic>algD </italic>are involved in phenotypes characteristic to <italic>colR </italic>mutant. Thus, more ColR-regulated genes should be present in the genome of <italic>P. putida</italic>. In this study we aimed to determine the ColR binding consensus sequence and to use it in the screen of <italic>P. putida </italic>genome for the presence of new potential ColR binding sites, which would predict new ColR target genes and operons.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>ColR (PP0901) regulates the expression of PP0903</title><p>The expression of genes downstream of <italic>colRS </italic>operon is regulated by ColR in <italic>P. fluorescens </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. This region of genome is well conserved among <italic>Pseudomonas </italic>bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] and therefore we presumed that the operon downstream of <italic>colRS </italic>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>) could be regulated by ColRS system in <italic>P. putida </italic>as well. This downstream operon consists of three genes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>). The first two, PP0903 coding for a putative methyltransferase and PP0904 coding for a lipopolysaccharide kinase InaA, are conserved among all 15 fully sequenced pseudomonads [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Putative orthologs of the third open reading frame PP0905 encoding for a hypothetical protein are present downstream of <italic>inaA </italic>in 13 sequenced members of <italic>Pseudomonas </italic>genus. In order to test whether these genes belong to ColR regulon in <italic>P. putida</italic>, we cloned the upstream region of PP0903 in front of <italic>lacZ </italic>gene in a promoter probe plasmid p9TT<sub>B</sub>lacZ and compared plasmid-encoded &#x003b2;-galactosidase activities in wild-type <italic>P. putida </italic>strain PaW85 and in its ColR-deficient derivative. Our unpublished results show that ColR-dependent phenotypes are more pronounced on solid medium if compared to that in liquid medium. Therefore, all enzyme activities presented in this study were measured from solid-medium-grown bacteria. The obtained data showed that ColR is a positive effector of PP0903 expression since &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity was comparable to the basal level of promoter probe vector p9TT<sub>B</sub>lacZ in a <italic>colR</italic>-deficient strain but was 10-fold higher in a wild-type strain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>). As our previous study showed that ColR-regulated <italic>oprQ </italic>and <italic>algD </italic>promoters were affected by phenol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], the &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity was also measured in the presence of phenol. Again, the activity of PP0903 promoter remained indistinguishable from the basal level of vector in the <italic>colR</italic>-mutant strain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>). However, phenol significantly enhanced the activity of PP0903 promoter in a wild-type strain where ColR is present (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>). To confirm the role of ColR in the activation of PP0903 promoter, &#x003b2;-galactosidase measurements were also performed in <italic>colR</italic>-mutant derivative PaWRtaccolR where the expression of ColR was inducible from P<sub><italic>tac </italic></sub>promoter with addition of IPTG. The activity of PP0903 promoter was already recovered in PaWRtaccolR strain without the induction of <italic>colR </italic>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>). This was expected as immunoblot analysis of ColR expression had previously revealed significant leakiness of P<sub><italic>tac </italic></sub>promoter in that particular strain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Over-expression of ColR resulted in a strong enhancement of PP0903 promoter over the wild-type level both on glucose and glucose plus phenol medium (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>). Hence, response regulator ColR is indeed necessary for up-regulation of PP0903 promoter in <italic>P. putida</italic>. Strong induction of the promoter by ColR over-expression suggests that either the amount of ColR is limiting in the wild-type cells or the ColS-activating signal is low in tested conditions. Data also imply that the impact of ColR on the PP0903 activation becomes more prominent in bacteria experiencing phenol-caused stress.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>ColR activates the expression of its downstream-locating PP0903</bold>.

As a certain binding consensus of a transcription factor is needed for that, we aimed to specify the exact binding sites of ColR in the promoters under its control. Our previous paper demonstrated that purified histidine-tagged ColR bound <italic>in vitro </italic>to the promoters of <italic>oprQ </italic>and <italic>algD </italic>in a gel mobility shift assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Similar analysis with PP0903 promoter showed that ColR also directly interacts with this promoter DNA. In order to map the ColR binding sites we performed a DNase I footprinting assay to the DNAs of <italic>oprQ</italic>, <italic>algD </italic>and PP0903 promoter fragments labelled with P<sup>32</sup>. Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref> illustrates the ColR-recognized regions in the promoters of <italic>oprQ </italic>and PP0903. ColR protected a 24-to-26-bp-long area in both promoters (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref>) depending on a strand analysed. ColR binding sites reside about 190 and 60 nucleotides upstream of translation start codons of <italic>oprQ </italic>and PP0903, respectively. The binding of ColR to PP0903 promoter resulted in the appearance of a hypersensitive site for DNase I just next to the ColR-protected region (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref>). Data also showed that the phosphorylated form of ColR (ColR~P) binds to the DNA with higher affinity than the unphosphorylated ColR. However, the effect of phosphorylation was stronger in case of PP0903 compared to <italic>oprQ </italic>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>ColR binding sites in the promoter regions of <italic>oprQ </italic>and PP0903</bold>.

This suggests that the binding dynamics of response regulator ColR could be somewhat different if <italic>algD </italic>promoter is compared to the promoters of <italic>oprQ </italic>and PP0903. Most probably ColR recognition sequences in the <italic>algD </italic>promoter diverge from ColR consensus (see Discussion).</p></sec><sec><title>Computer search for potential ColR binding sites revealed several new ColR-regulated genes</title><p>Comparison of ColR recognition sequences in the promoters of <italic>oprQ </italic>and PP0903 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref>) shows clearly that these two sequences are similar. The most obvious common feature is a central T-track, 5-bp and 7-bp long in case of <italic>oprQ </italic>and PP0903, respectively (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref>). In total 10 identical nucleotides are present in these two ColR binding sites allowing to deduce a 13-bp-long consensus motif for ColR binding &#x02013; ACGNNTTTTTNAC. High similarity of the two ColR binding boxes suggested that a genome-wide computer search could reveal new potential target genes of ColR. Thus, sequences similar to identified ColR binding sites were searched from the genome of <italic>P. putida </italic>KT2440 using two free-access web-servers, PredictRegulon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and Virtual Footprint [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Several inquiries with varying input sequence length and strand orientation were performed. Results of both programmes were compared and identical hits were chosen for experimental validation. Actually, the prediction and identification of new ColR binding sites presented below was a step-by-step process meaning that new predictions were made with every additional confirmed ColR binding site (see Methods). For experimental evaluation of the computer-predicted putative ColR-regulated promoters, they were cloned into a promoter probe plasmid p9TT<sub>B</sub>lacZ upstream of the <italic>lacZ </italic>gene. If a predicted ColR-binding site was located between two divergently transcribed genes, then this DNA region was cloned upstream of the reporter in both orientations (promoters of PP0035/0036, PP0900/0901 and PP2560/2561). &#x003b2;-galactosidase activities were measured in wild-type and ColR-deficient <italic>P. putida </italic>cells grown overnight on glucose and glucose plus phenol solid media. Additionally, since promoter activity of PP0903 was strongly enhanced by over-expression of ColR (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>) all promoters were tested also in a <italic>P. putida </italic>strain PaWRtaccolR where the expression of ColR can be induced from P<sub>tac </sub>promoter. Results of &#x003b2;-galactosidase assay show that promoters of PP0035, PP0036, PP0737, PP0900, PP1636, PP2560 and PP3766 are responsive to the absence and/or to the over-expression of ColR (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). All promoters except PP0737 are positively affected by ColR. If promoters were tested in the presence of 2.5 mM phenol then the effects of ColR-deficiency and over-expression became more evident in case of most promoters. For instance, while promoters of PP0036, PP0900, PP1636, PP2560 and PP3766 were only barely affected by the absence of ColR in the glucose-grown cells, then the impact of ColR upon these promoters became obvious in the glucose plus phenol-grown bacteria. It is also remarkable that all promoters analysed responded significantly more to the over-expression than to the absence of ColR. Namely, ColR over-expression clearly enhanced the activities of promoters that are under its positive control (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Especially drastic activation was seen in case of PP0035 where over-expressed ColR caused 30-fold increase in the promoter activity when compared to that in a wild-type strain (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). At the same time, the activity of PP0035 promoter was only 3-fold lower in glucose-grown <italic>colR </italic>mutant than in wild-type. Analogous to that, the over-expression of ColR lowered the activity of negatively ColR-affected PP0737 promoter about 3-fold but the lack of ColR affected this particular promoter less than 2-fold (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). This data strongly suggest that either ColR amount is limiting in wild-type <italic>P. putida </italic>to affect significantly the expression of analysed target promoters or the signal perceived and transduced by ColS is low under the conditions employed by us.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Effects of ColR on the expression of a set of computationally predicted promoters</bold>. &#x003b2;-galactosidase (&#x003b2;-gal) activities measured in wild-type (wt), <italic>colR</italic>-defective (colR) and <italic>colR</italic>-defective strain PaWRtaccolR complemented with <italic>colR </italic>gene under the control of the P<sub>tac </sub>promoter (RtacR). <italic>P. putida </italic>strains carried reporter plasmids with promoter regions of following genes: PP0035, PP0036, PP0900, PP0901, PP0737, PP1636, PP2560 or PP3766. Bacteria were grown either on glucose (glc) or glucose plus 2.5 mM phenol (glc+phe) minimal plates. ColR expression in strain PaWRtaccolR was induced with 0.5 mM IPTG (RtacR+IPTG). Data (means and standard deviations) from at least three independent experiments are presented.

Dots indicate significant differences between PaWRtaccolR strain and PaWRtaccolR strain grown with IPTG.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2199-10-46-3"/></fig><p>It is important to point out that one new ColR-regulated gene, PP0900, locates just upstream of <italic>colRS </italic>genes and is transcribed divergently from PP0901 encoding <italic>colR </italic>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>). Thus, the putative ColR-binding site affecting the expression of PP0900 is actually located between PP0900 and <italic>colR</italic>. Analysis of this particular promoter in the direction of <italic>colR </italic>(PP0901) did not reveal clear ColR-responsiveness under any conditions examined (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Therefore we conclude that ColR does not auto-regulate its own expression.</p></sec><sec><title>ColR binding sites in the promoters of predicted target genes</title><p>We aimed to confirm that <italic>in silico </italic>predicted ColR binding sites upstream of different genes, which expression was ColR-dependent <italic>in vivo</italic>, could really bind ColR. For that purpose, we performed a DNase I footprinting analysis to six promoter regions that were tested in a &#x003b2;-galactosidase assay (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a</xref> shows ColR protection patterns of five different promoter regions &#x02013; PP0035/0036, PP0737, PP0900/0901, PP2560/2561 and PP3766. The length of ColR-protected area varied between the promoters analysed ranging from 18-bp in one strand of PP0737 up to 46-bp in PP3766 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4b</xref>). Phosphorylation of ColR by ColS significantly increased its affinity to DNAs upstream of PP0900/0901, PP2560/2561 and PP3766. The binding of ColR to several promoter DNAs changed the DNase I digestion pattern revealing new hypersensitive sites for DNase. Paradoxically, ColR could not affect the DNase I digestion pattern of the PP1636 promoter (data not shown), although, this promoter was influenced by ColR <italic>in vivo </italic>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) and ColR binding to this DNA was clearly detectable in a gel mobility shift assay (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). It is noteworthy that the same was seen in case of ColR-regulated <italic>algD </italic>promoter (see above). Thus, performed footprint analysis could not reveal all ColR binding sites in the promoters of its target genes.

The length of the region protected by ColR varied significantly in different promoters (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Therefore, rather long DNA fragments (presented in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) were compared in order to find out whether sequences surrounding the core ColR-recognition site are conserved as well. Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref> demonstrates a ColR binding consensus created using WebLogo server [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In the middle of the sequence a well-conserved 16-bp-long core with 8 totally conserved positions is present, whereas most of the distant positions are much less conserved. Therefore, only the core region was defined as a final ColR binding consensus ((T/C)(T/C)NA(C/G)NN(T/C)TTTTT(C/G)AC). Next, this 16-bp-long core was used to predict minimal regulon of ColRS system. 41 ColR binding motif-resembling sites were extracted from <italic>P. putida </italic>genome by searching the upstream regions (500 bp upstream of the translation start) of all genes using a PredictRegulon server tool. As several binding sites locate between divergently transcribed genes one may assume that ColR regulon potentially consists of more than 50 different genes (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). However, whilst the first 11 sites of prediction match perfectly with 7 input sequences, the rest of the matches score lower than the cut-off value (6.76929 in our prediction; see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). Therefore, they should be considered as potential novel ColR sites, which should be confirmed experimentally. It is notable that three genes (PP1692, PP2322 and PP2323) predicted as ColR-regulated possess two potential ColR-binding sites in their promoter regions (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). There are genes of different functions in the predicted regulon of ColRS two-component system (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>), but in accordance with previous results, this signal system seems to regulate many membrane associated functions. Namely, 56% of putative ColR binding sites locate upstream of genes implicated in various membrane functions. Furthermore, inspection of the first 26 sites shows that even 87% of them locate upstream of genes coding for membrane proteins (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). It is also remarkable that about one third of the putative members of ColR regulon code for hypothetical proteins (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>ColR binding consensus</bold>.

Therefore, to decipher the role of a particular two-component pathway it is crucial to specify the downstream components of the cascade. This study focuses on identification of target genes of a <italic>Pseudomonas </italic>two-component system ColRS, thus serving as an indispensable step in the way of unravelling the mechanisms that trigger different phenotypes related to ColRS deficiency.</p><p>Previously, we have searched for ColR-regulated genes by using a promoter library created from total chromosomal DNA of <italic>P. putida </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. This screen disclosed only two ColR target genes, thus forcing us to try different approach to acquire more information about the putative regulon of ColRS system. We aimed to define a binding consensus for the transcription factor ColR and to search for similar sequences in the upstream regions of genes in the genome of <italic>P. putida</italic>. Seven experimentally verified ColR binding sites demonstrated a highly conserved ColR-binding motif with 8 fully conserved nucleotides in the 16-bp-long core binding box (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). The binding motifs of OmpR subfamily response regulators, among whom ColR belongs <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pseudomonas.com"/>, consist typically of direct repeats separated by four to five nucleotides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Careful inspection of ColR binding sites reveals that there are also two direct repeats. Although one of the repeats is much less conserved than the other, such structure of the binding site indicates that ColR binds to the DNA as a dimer. Notably, our data suggest that in addition to the highly conserved core sequence, ColR may also recognize and bind to less conserved sites. Namely, ColR regulates <italic>algD </italic>promoter <italic>in vivo </italic>and binds to this promoter in a phosphorylation-dependent manner according to gel mobility shift experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Yet, computational analysis could not find a good ColR binding motif and DNase I protection analysis did not locate ColR binding site in the promoter region of <italic>algD</italic>. Nevertheless, the sequence upstream of <italic>algD </italic>contains many T-rich tracks characteristic for ColR binding consensus. If we lowered the specificity of Virtual Footprint prediction by allowing three mismatches in the input consensus then four putative ColR binding sites were found in <italic>algD </italic>promoter region, which was previously shown to bind ColR in DNA shift assay (data not shown). Probably ColR binds to these less conserved and thereby with lower affinity sites, but DNA cleavage by DNase I destabilizes the ColR-DNA complex and hence the ColR protected area cannot be detected by DNase footprint assay. Analogously, the nucleoprotein complex between the ColR and the upstream region of PP1636 probably dissociates due to DNase I cleavage-caused destabilization.</p><p>Given that some promoter regions (e.g. those of PP1692 and PP2322/2323) contain putatively more than one ColR consensus-resembling site (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>) one may hypothesise that co-operative binding of ColR to several sites may be necessary for regulation of these ColR target promoters. In this connection it is interesting to note that <italic>in silico </italic>analysis of seven experimentally verified ColR-binding promoters, revealed more putative ColR boxes than identified by DNase footprint assay. Namely, promoter regions of <italic>oprQ</italic>, PP0900/0901 and PP2560/2561 contain additional less-conserved ColR boxes (data not shown). Further experiments should prove whether these additional sites really support ColR binding to these promoters.</p><p>In this study several new ColR-dependent promoters were identified. Intriguingly, the effect of ColR absence upon promoter activities was rather modest (PP0035, PP0900, PP0737, PP1636) or not detectable (PP0036, PP2560, PP3766) when bacteria grew on glucose medium (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). The greatest effect was seen in case of PP0903 promoter whose activity was 10-fold down-regulated in a ColR-deficient <italic>P. putida </italic>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). However, the role of ColR in regulation of its target genes was confirmed by analysis of promoter activities under conditions of ColR over-expression. Indeed, most promoters tested were strongly influenced by ColR over-expression, especially when phenol was present in the growth medium (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). This data indicate that the amount of transcriptionally active ColR is not sufficient enough to influence significantly most of its target promoters in wild-type <italic>P. putida </italic>in our assay conditions. Given that the phosphorylated form of ColR bound to its recognition sequences more avidly it is reasonable to conclude that actually the phosphorylated form of ColR is limiting in bacteria growing on glucose solid medium. Therefore, we consider that most probably the ColS-activating signal is low under our assay conditions. ColR over-expression could apparently mimic the conditions evoked by the signal and therefore the ColR-dependence of its target promoters was seen more clearly in the situation of ColR over-expression. This scenario is in good accordance with our previous data showing that over-expression of ColR can compensate the defect in signal transfer from ColS to ColR when the participation of ColRS system in regulation of Tn<italic>4652 </italic>transposition was examined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The signal sensed by ColS is not known so far. However, our observation that the impact of ColR on the expression of its target promoters was greater in the presence of phenol (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) indicates that phenol-caused stress could be one of the conditions where ColRS signal transduction pathway is, at least partially, activated. This suggestion agrees with our previous results demonstrating the participation of ColRS system in phenol tolerance of <italic>P. putida </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>Current study shows that ColR regulates directly genes locating upstream and downstream of its own gene. Like in <italic>P. fluorescens</italic>, ColR of <italic>P. putida </italic>also activates the downstream of <italic>colRS </italic>locating operon, that was suggested to be involved in fine-tuning of the outer membrane permeability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. It is notable that ColR regulates several other outer membrane protein-encoding genes confirming the role of ColRS system in the regulation of membrane functionality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In addition to our previous finding that outer membrane protein-encoding <italic>oprQ </italic>is negatively controlled by ColR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], the current study revealed that ColR is a negative factor also for PP0737 which codes for a protein orthologous to lipid A 3-O-deacylase PagL in <italic>P. aeruginosa </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The outer membrane-locating PagL modifies lipopolysaccharides by deacylation of lipid A at 3-O-position [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. PagL becomes important under specific conditions only, e.g., it will be needed for mutants deficient in aminoarabinose-modified lipid A to resist cationic antimicrobial peptides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. In pathogenic Gram-negative bacteria the PagL-dependent deacylation of lipid A reduces the ability of lipid A to activate the Toll-like receptor 4 of the host, thus helping pathogens to avoid innate immune recognition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The role of PagL has not been studied in <italic>P. putida </italic>so far.</p><p>Our data show that besides affecting the composition of outer membrane, ColR also regulates other membrane compartments. For instance, ColR activated PP0900 and PP1636 coding for two cytoplasmic membrane-locating enzymes, putative type 2 phosphatidic acid phosphatase (PAP2) and diacylglycerol kinase DgkA, respectively. These two enzymes most probably affect the membrane lipid homeostasis as they reversely regulate the abundance of phosphatidic acid and diacylglycerol, the precursor of phospholipid synthesis and the by-product of the synthesis of membrane-derived oligosaccharides, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Given that prediction of ColR regulon revealed another fatty acid and phospholipid metabolism related gene <italic>acpP </italic>(PP1915), coding for acyl carrier protein, as a putative ColR target gene, indeed, ColRS system may be involved in phospholipids homeostasis.</p><p>Since ColR is highly conserved among all <italic>Pseudomonas </italic>species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] it was reasonable to presume that ColR-binding sites may also be similar in pseudomonads. Genome-wide prediction of potential ColR-binding sites in <italic>P. fluorescens </italic>PfO-1 disclosed seven genes that could be members of ColR regulon both in <italic>P. putida </italic>and <italic>P. fluorescens </italic>(see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). Namely, ColR-binding box was found upstream of <italic>P. fluorescens </italic>PfO-1 genes orthologous to <italic>P. putida dgkA-1</italic>, <italic>colR</italic>/PP0900, PP0737, PP0903, PP1058, PP1692 and PP5152 (data not shown). Additional screening of <italic>P. aeruginosa </italic>PAO1, <italic>P. syringae tomato </italic>DC3000 and <italic>P. syringae phaseolicola </italic>1448A revealed that all these organisms contain perfect ColR-recognition sites upstream of <italic>dgkA-1 </italic>orthologs. Therefore, it is highly possible that <italic>dgkA </italic>is a member of ColR regulon in all these pseudomonads.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Current study identified a 16-bp-long binding consensus of response regulator ColR ((T/C)(T/C)NA(C/G)NN(T/C)TTTTT(C/G)AC), which helped us to discover new genes controlled by ColRS two-component system in <italic>P. putida</italic>. Notably, several new ColR target genes (PP0035, PP0737, PP0900, PP1636 and PP2560) code for different membrane proteins supporting our previous assumption that the primary target of ColRS two-component system is the cell membrane. Regulon prediction suggests that ColR could regulate over 40 genes and many of them code for membrane-associated functions as well. However, it is not clear yet which of the target genes are responsible for specific ColR-related phenotypes such as lowered phenol tolerance, hindrance of transposition of Tn<italic>4652 </italic>and glucose-induced lysis of a subpopulation of the <italic>colR </italic>mutant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Considering the number of ColR regulon genes it is highly possible that not one but several ColR target genes are involved in the formation of above-mentioned phenotypes. Given that ColRS two-component system is regulating several membrane-related genes, our further experiments are directed towards clarification the role of ColR target genes in the membrane functionality.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Bacterial strains, plasmids and media</title><p><italic>P. putida </italic>strain PaW85 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], which is isogenic to fully sequenced KT2440 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], its <italic>colR-</italic>deficient derivative PaWcolR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and PaWcolR derivative strain PaWRtaccolR capable of over-expression of ColR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] were used in this study. <italic>E. coli </italic>strain DH5&#x003b1; (Invitrogen) was used for DNA manipulations.
