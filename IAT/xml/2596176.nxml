Small-molecule inhibitors of MEK1/MEK2 are therefore viewed as attractive drug candidates for the targeted therapy of this malignancy. However, the exact contribution of MEK1 and MEK2 to the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer remains to be established.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Wild type and constitutively active forms of MEK1 and MEK2 were ectopically expressed by retroviral gene transfer in the normal intestinal epithelial cell line IEC-6. We studied the impact of MEK1 and MEK2 activation on cellular morphology, cell proliferation, survival, migration, invasiveness, and tumorigenesis in mice. RNA interference was used to test the requirement for MEK1 and MEK2 function in maintaining the proliferation of human colorectal cancer cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We found that expression of activated MEK1 or MEK2 is sufficient to morphologically transform intestinal epithelial cells, dysregulate cell proliferation and induce the formation of high-grade adenocarcinomas after orthotopic transplantation in mice. A large proportion of these intestinal tumors metastasize to the liver and lung. Mechanistically, activation of MEK1 or MEK2 up-regulates the expression of matrix metalloproteinases, promotes invasiveness and protects cells from undergoing anoikis. Importantly, we show that silencing of MEK2 expression completely suppresses the proliferation of human colon carcinoma cell lines, whereas inactivation of MEK1 has a much weaker effect.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>MEK1 and MEK2 isoforms have similar transforming properties and are able to induce the formation of metastatic intestinal tumors in mice. Our results suggest that MEK2 plays a more important role than MEK1 in sustaining the proliferation of human colorectal cancer cells.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Colorectal cancer arises from intestinal epithelial cells in a multistep process that extend over several years and leads to the progression from a normal mucosa to aberrant crypt foci to benign adenomas up to invasive carcinomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Histo-pathological progression of colorectal tumors is associated with the progressive accumulation of genetic alterations in tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The most frequently mutated oncogene in colorectal tumors is <italic>KRAS</italic>, a member of the <italic>RAS </italic>gene family. Activating mutations in the three <italic>RAS </italic>genes, most frequently in <italic>KRAS</italic>, have been found in ~30% of human neoplasias and are often an early event in tumor progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Specifically, <italic>KRAS </italic>mutations are detected in approximately 35% of all sporadic colorectal adenomas and carcinomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Genetic and biochemical studies have firmly established the central role of Ras GTPases in regulating cell proliferation, growth and survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. More than ten distinct classes of Ras effectors have been identified to date, several of which are associated with oncogenic signaling pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The best-characterized of the Ras effector pathways is the activation of the Raf family Ser/Thr kinases, leading to sequential phosphorylation and activation of MEK1/MEK2 and the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases ERK1/ERK2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The importance of Raf in oncogenic signaling has been validated by the discovery of activating <italic>BRAF </italic>mutations in a variety of human tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], including 14% of colorectal cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Raf relays its oncogenic signals mainly via the MAP kinase kinases MEK1 and MEK2. Early studies have shown that expression of activated alleles of MEK1 is sufficient to deregulate the proliferation and trigger the morphological transformation of immortalized fibroblast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and epithelial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] cell lines. <italic>In vivo</italic>, orthotopic transplantation of mammary epithelial cells expressing activated MEK1 into syngeneic mice rapidly produced invasive adenocarcinomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Transgenic expression of active MEK1 in mouse skin induced hyperplasia, hyperkeratosis and perturbed differentiation of the epidermis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Conversely, treatment with MEK1/2 inhibitors was shown to inhibit the proliferation of various carcinoma and leukemic cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Notably, administration of an orally-available inhibitor of MEK1/2 elicited marked anti-tumor efficacy in mouse xenograft models of colon cancer and metastatic melanoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. In parallel, several studies using clinical specimens have documented the up-regulation and/or activation of MEK1/MEK2 and the MAP kinases ERK1/ERK2 in solid tumors and leukemias (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] and references therein). Collectively, these findings have provided strong rationale for the development of small-molecule inhibitors of MEK1/2 for chemotherapeutic intervention in cancer.</p><p>MEK1 and MEK2 display 85% amino acid identity overall and are expressed ubiquitously in cell lines and tissues. Although it is commonly assumed that the two isoforms are functionally equivalent, several lines of evidence, however, indicate that they are regulated differentially and may exert non-redundant functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Studies using RNA interference have suggested that both MEK1 and MEK2 are required for <italic>in vitro </italic>cell proliferation, and that they contribute to distinct cell cycle regulatory events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. However, the individual roles of MEK1 and MEK2 in tumorigenesis remain to be explored. Intriguingly, a recent report has shown that activated MEK1 but not MEK2 can promote epidermal hyperplasia in transgenic mice, even though both MEK proteins trigger ERK1/ERK2 phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>Colorectal cancers often display activation of the ERK1/2 MAP kinase pathway and therefore represent potential targets for MEK1/2 inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. In this study, we have evaluated the ability of the two MEK isoforms to transform intestinal epithelial cells and to promote tumor formation and progression <italic>in vivo</italic>. Our results demonstrate that activation of either MEK1 or MEK2 is sufficient for full transformation of intestinal epithelial cells up to the invasive stage. Importantly, we show that MEK2 expression is essential for the proliferation of human colon cancer cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture and infections</title><p>IEC-6 is a rat epithelial cell line with features of undifferentiated small intestinal crypt cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].

Overexpression of wild type MEK1 or MEK2 did not affect the expression of endogenous MEK isoforms. However, ectopic expression or MEK2DD slightly increased the steady-state levels of endogenous MEK1, while overexpression of MEK1DD had a similar effect on MEK2 levels (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). As expected, substitution of the activation loop Ser phosphorylation sites by Asp residues strongly potentiated the enzymatic activity of MEK1 and MEK2, but no reproducible difference in activity was observed between the two isoforms (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Expression of activated MEK1 or MEK2 morphologically transforms intestinal epithelial cells</bold>.

These changes are characteristic of epithelial-mesenchymal transitions (EMT) that play an important role in tumor progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. To determine whether MEK1DD- and MEK2DD-expressing cells undergo an EMT, we examined the localization and measured the expression levels of various epithelial and mesenchymal markers. Parental and vector-infected IEC-6 cells showed a polarized basolateral membrane distribution of the epithelial marker E-cadherin, with basal expression of the fibroblast marker vimentin (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>). Ectopic expression of MEK1DD or MEK2DD resulted in the loss of E-cadherin staining at the plasma membrane (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>), concomitant with a marked reduction of E-cadherin protein and mRNA levels (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1G</xref>). No significant change in the expression of keratins and no induction of the mesenchymal proteins vimentin and smooth muscle &#x003b1;-actin (we instead observed a decreased expression) were observed in these cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F</xref>). These results indicate that constitutive activation of MEK1 or MEK2, while disrupting normal epithelial morphology and polarization, is not sufficient to induce a full EMT in intestinal epithelial cells. This epithelial plasticity change has been referred to as scattering and is distinct from EMT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>].</p><p>We examined whether constitutive activation of MEK1 or MEK2 was conferring some proliferation advantage to intestinal epithelial cells. Ectopic expression of either activated MEK1 or MEK2 significantly increased the proliferation rate of IEC-6 cells grown in 10% serum containing-medium when compared to vector-infected cells or cells overexpressing wild type MEK isoforms (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). This increase in proliferation was not observed in low serum (2%) containing-medium (data not shown). Both activated MEK1 and MEK2 conferred anchorage-independence growth to IEC-6 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). To test the tumorigenic potential of IEC-6 transduced cell populations <italic>in vivo</italic>, the cells were injected subcutaneously into athymic mice. Cells infected with vector or wild type MEK isoforms never formed any tumor (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). In contrast, both MEK1DD- and MEK2DD-expressing cells generated rapidly growing tumors in all injected mice. Injection of as low as 3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4 </sup>cells produced tumors of ~1,000 mm<sup>3 </sup>after 2 weeks. No major difference was observed in the growth rate of tumors expressing activated MEK1 or MEK2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Expression of activated MEK1 or MEK2 enhances the proliferation of IEC-6 cells and induces the formation of intestinal tumors</bold>.

Strikingly, 100% of the mice transplanted with 10<sup>5 </sup>IEC-6 cells expressing either MEK1DD or MEK2DD developed massive intestinal tumors, while the control group remained tumor-free (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref>).

Microscopic examination of the tumors revealed a poorly differentiated morphology with occasional signet-ring cells (inset) corresponding to a high-grade adenocarcinoma (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref>). The tumors are invasive and diffusely infiltrate the lamina propria and the underlying muscular layers (muscularis propria and muscularis mucosae).

Analysis of the gene expression data identified several genes that were up-regulated or down-regulated in MEK1DD- and MEK2DD-expressing cells as compared to control IEC-6 cells (Additional files <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). The list of modulated genes included growth factors, signaling molecules, drug metabolism enzymes and, interestingly, several proteases. The matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) MMP-3 and MMP-13 were up-regulated in both MEK1DD- and MEK2DD-expressing cells, while up-regulation of MMP-10 reached significance only in MEK2DD cells. Expression of the urokinase receptor was also up-regulated in IEC-6 cells expressing activated MEK2. Because of the importance of MMPs and urokinase receptor in tumor progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>], we further validated the regulation of these genes by MEK1 and MEK2 signaling to confirm the data from the arrays. No expression or activity of MMPs could be detected in empty vector-infected IEC-6 cells. However, activation of either MEK1 or MEK2 markedly up-regulated the expression of MMP-13 protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). Notably, higher levels of MMP-13 protein were detected in IEC-6 cells expressing the activated MEK2 isoform. The expression of MMP-3/10 was analyzed by measuring their activity by zymography in casein-containing gels. Again, we observed that MEK2DD increased MMP-3/10 enzymatic activity more robustly than MEK1DD (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). Quantitative PCR analysis confirmed that constitutive activation of MEK1 or MEK2 induces the expression of urokinase receptor mRNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>).

Of the 69 gene transcripts that showed altered expression in the study of Komatsu, 18 (26%) were found to be modulated in IEC-6 cells expressing constitutively active MEK1 or MEK2.

To further explore the mechanism by which MEK1 and MEK2 promote tumor metastasis, we asked whether activated MEK isoforms protect intestinal epithelial cells from cell death induced by loss of adhesion. IEC-6-transduced populations were placed on poly-HEMA-coated plates in normal growth medium and the extent of apoptosis was measured at different times by TUNEL. Detachment from matrix induced high levels of apoptosis of control IEC-6 cells, which was already detectable at 6 h and increased up to 24 h (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>).

We next wanted to determine if human colon cancer cells depend on the activity of MEK isoforms for cell proliferation. Several human colon carcinoma cell lines display constitutive phosphorylation of ERK1/ERK2 MAP kinases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], likely resulting from activation of MEK1/MEK2. The HCT116 cell line, which represents one of the best studied model of colorectal cancer cells, display constitutive activation of the two MEK isoforms (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). To assess the individual roles of MEK1 and MEK2, we expressed short-hairpin (sh) RNAs specifically targeting MEK1 or MEK2 gene in HCT116 cells using VSV-pseudotyped lentiviral vectors. We tested the effect of 5 distinct shRNAs for MEK1 and 3 shRNAs for MEK2, using as control a GFP-encoding vector. We selected the two most efficient shRNAs to MEK1 and MEK2 genes (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>). A non-silencing inactive MEK1 shRNA was used as additional negative control in these experiments. The efficiency of transduction estimated by GFP immunofluorescence was over 90%, and therefore the experiments were performed without cellular selection. As shown by immunoblot analysis, lentivirus-mediated delivery of MEK1 shRNAs resulted in complete silencing of MEK1 expression with no effect on MEK2, whereas the two MEK2 shRNAs markedly knocked-down MEK2 expression without affecting MEK1 isoform (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). We then analyzed the functional consequence of MEK1 or MEK2 silencing on the proliferation rate of the cells. Strikingly, lowering of MEK2 expression with the two shRNAs completely suppressed the proliferation of HCT116 cells, whereas MEK1 shRNAs exerted a significant but much weaker effect (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). The extent of inhibition observed with MEK2 shRNAs was similar to that obtained by treating cells with the non-selective MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126. We also showed that silencing of MEK1 or MEK2 expression significantly reduces the extent of ERK1 and ERK2 activating phosphorylation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>Impact of MEK1 or MEK2 silencing on the proliferation of human colon carcinoma cell lines</bold>.

We specifically chose the human colon carcinoma cell lines SW480 (which harbors a <italic>KRAS </italic>mutation like HCT116) and HT-29 (harboring a <italic>BRAF </italic>mutation). SW480 cells display a comparable expression pattern of MEK1 and MEK2 proteins as HCT116 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). Similar to HCT116 cells, knock-down of MEK2 expression dramatically suppressed the proliferation of SW480 cells, whereas MEK1 silencing induced a significant but much lower decrease of cell proliferation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6C</xref>). Similar results were obtained in HT-29 cells, except that the inhibitory effect of MEK1 shRNAs on proliferation was quantitatively more important than on HCT116 and SW480 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6D</xref>). This observation could be explained by the much higher expression of MEK1 in the HT-29 cell line as compared to HCT116 or SW480 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>), which may have a more important contribution to total MEK1/2 signaling. However, the single inactivation of MEK2 was still capable of abolishing the proliferation of HT-29 cells even in the presence of high MEK1 levels. For all colorectal cancer cell lines tested, the inhibition of proliferation seen with MEK2 shRNAs was comparable to that achieved with the MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126.</p><p>To further extend our investigation to non-colorectal carcinomas, we tested the effect of MEK1 and MEK2 shRNAs on the human breast adenocarcinoma cell line MDA-MB-231, which exhibit strong constitutive activation of MEK1/MEK2 signaling (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). Interestingly, the MEK2 shRNA-06 completely inhibited the proliferation of MDA-MB-231 cells to the same extent as the drug inhibitor U0126 (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>).

Expression of MEK1 shRNAs suppressed cell proliferation by approximately 50%.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The ERK1/2 MAP kinase signaling pathway plays a central role in cell proliferation control. Activation of ERK1/ERK2 is essential for G1 to S phase progression and is associated with induction of cyclin Ds and inhibition of anti-proliferative genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. Studies in various experimental models have also implicated the Raf-MEK1/2-ERK1/2 pathway in the control of cell survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. Consistent with a role in cell cycle and survival signaling, there is growing evidence that activation of the ERK1/2 pathway is involved in the pathogenesis of human cancer (see Introduction). Specifically, several observations point towards a role of this pathway in colorectal cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. First, the EGF receptor, a known activator of the ERK1/2 pathway, is expressed in more than 70% of colorectal cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]; treatment with the EGF receptor monoclonal antibody cetuximab improves overall survival in patients with colorectal cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. Second, <italic>KRAS </italic>and <italic>BRAF </italic>genes are mutated in approximately 50% of colorectal cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Third, activating phosphorylation of ERK1/ERK2 MAP kinases is frequently observed in human colorectal cancer cell lines and tumor specimens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Finally, treatment with synthetic MEK1/2 inhibitors markedly attenuates the proliferation of colon carcinoma cells <italic>in vitro </italic>and in mouse xenografts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Despite such evidence, several important questions about the contribution of the ERK1/2 MAP kinase pathway to the initiation and progression of colorectal cancer remain unanswered.</p><p>In this study, we show that constitutive activation of MEK1 or MEK2 isoform, as observed in 44% of colorectal cancers, is sufficient to fully transform normal intestinal epithelial cells and that maintenance of MEK1/MEK2 activity is necessary to sustain the proliferation of human colon carcinoma cells. This is the first report to compare the ability of the two MEK isoforms to transform epithelial cells. Previous studies have shown that activated MEK1 can transform immortalized fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] as well as epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. Intriguingly, it was also reported that activated Ras, but not Raf-1, causes transformation of mammary and intestinal epithelial cells, suggesting that signaling events other than activation of MEK1/2 are essential for oncogenic Ras transformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. Here, we clearly establish that expression of activated MEK1 is sufficient to morphologically transform intestinal epithelial cells, accelerate cell proliferation, and induce the rapid formation of aggressive tumors after orthotopic transplantation. Moreover, we reveal for the first time that the MEK2 isoform has similar transforming properties and is able to induce the formation of tumors in mice. This knowledge is important since both MEK1 and MEK2 are expressed in intestinal epithelial cells and immunohistochemistry analysis with phospho-specific MEK1/2 antibodies does not allow to discriminate between the two isoforms. Immunoblot analysis under electrophoresis conditions that partially resolve the two isoforms indicates that both MEK1 and MEK2 are phosphorylated in human colon carcinoma cell lines (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>).</p><p>The signaling pathways underlying the progression of colorectal cancer to advanced metastatic disease are poorly understood. The development of metastatic tumors is a complex process that consists of a series of cellular events that move neoplastic cells from the primary tumor to a distant location [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. Cancer cells must detach from the tumor and invade the surrounding tissue, degrade the basement membrane, disseminate and survive into the circulation systems, extravasate into a new tissue, and colonize their new microenvironment. During this process, tumor cells have to face different kinds of stress. Recent studies have suggested that Ras signaling may contribute to metastasis formation in colorectal cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>], although the downstream effector pathways involved remain unclear. Here, we show that expression of activated MEK1 or MEK2 not only induces the formation of intestinal tumors but also promotes later stages of tumor progression and metastasis to distant organs. To address the impact of MEK1/MEK2 signaling on tumor progression, we have used an orthotopic implantation model that provides a more accurate picture of the metastatic process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>]. A large proportion of the tumors expressing activated MEK1 or MEK2 metastasized to the liver and lung, the two most common sites of human colorectal cancer metastasis, thereby validating the pathological relevance of our model. The ability of activated MEK1- or MEK2-expressing tumor cells to colonize distant organs was associated with increased invasiveness, secretion of matrix proteases and resistance to anoikis. Interestingly, an early study reported that the enzymatic activity of ERK1/ERK2 is markedly up-regulated during late progression of carcinogen-induced colon carcinomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>]. Together, these observations strengthen the idea that ERK1/2 MAP kinase signaling plays a critical role in colorectal cancer progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><p>An important finding of this study is the observation that MEK1 and MEK2 may contribute differentially to the pathogenesis of colorectal cancer. While activation of a single MEK isoform was shown to be sufficient for full neoplastic transformation of intestinal epithelial cells, we observed that MEK2DD-expressing cells display a slightly more transformed morphology and are more invasive than cells expressing MEK1DD <italic>in vitro</italic>. This was associated with a more prominent down-regulation of E-cadherin and a stronger up-regulation of MMPs and urokinase receptor. The physiopathological relevance of these <italic>in vitro </italic>properties is unclear, however, since no difference in the metastatic behavior of the cells was observed upon orthotopic transplantation in mice. The simplest explanation for this apparent discrepancy is that <italic>in vitro </italic>invasiveness assays do not replicate the complex and multistage process of tumor metastasis <italic>in vivo</italic>. Most importantly, we found that silencing of MEK2 expression (even if not total) completely suppressed the proliferation of human colon carcinoma cell lines, whereas complete knock-down of MEK1 had a much weaker effect. The extent of inhibition observed with MEK2 shRNAs was comparable to that obtained with the non-selective MEK1/2 inhibitor U0126. This differential impact of MEK1 and MEK2 on cell proliferation was observed in three different colon carcinoma cell lines (bearing activating mutations in either <italic>KRAS </italic>or <italic>BRAF</italic>), as well as in the breast adenocarcinoma cell line MDA-MB-231. The molecular basis for these differences remains to be established. One possibility is that MEK2 is expressed at higher levels than MEK1 in colon cancer cells. However, immunoblot analysis clearly indicates that HT-29 cells express more phosphorylated MEK1 (lower band in upper panel of Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>) than MEK2, arguing that quantitative difference in expression levels does not explain everything. Our results rather suggest that the two MEK isoforms may be differentially regulated or may target distinct effector pathways in certain cellular and/or genetic contexts.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, we demonstrate that the two MAP kinase kinase isoforms MEK1 and MEK2 have similar transforming properties and that activation of either isoform is sufficient for full transformation of intestinal epithelial cells up to the metastatic stage. Interestingly, our results indicate that MEK2 plays a more important role than MEK1 in sustaining the proliferation of human colorectal cancer cells, suggesting that the two MEK isoforms may contribute differentially to tumor pathogenesis in certain contexts.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>LV participated to most of the experiments and contributed to study design, analysis of the data and drafting of the manuscript.
