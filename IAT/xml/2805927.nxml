Recently, the chloroplast protein HCF101 (high chlorophyll fluorescence 101) has been shown to be essential for the accumulation of the membrane complex Photosystem I and the soluble ferredoxin-thioredoxin reductases, both containing [4Fe-4S] clusters. The protein belongs to the FSC-NTPase ([4Fe-4S]-cluster-containing P-loop NTPase) superfamily, several members of which play a crucial role in Fe/S cluster biosynthesis. Although the C-terminal ISC-binding site, conserved in other members of the FSC-NTPase family, is not present in chloroplast HCF101 homologues using M&#x000f6;ssbauer and EPR spectroscopy, we provide evidence that HCF101 binds a [4Fe-4S] cluster. <sup>55</sup>Fe incorporation studies of mitochondrially targeted HCF101 in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> confirmed the assembly of an Fe/S cluster in HCF101 in an Nfs1-dependent manner. Site-directed mutagenesis identified three HCF101-specific cysteine residues required for assembly and/or stability of the cluster. We further demonstrate that the reconstituted cluster is transiently bound and can be transferred from HCF101 to a [4Fe-4S] apoprotein. Together, our findings suggest that HCF101 may serve as a chloroplast scaffold protein that specifically assembles [4Fe-4S] clusters and transfers them to the chloroplast membrane and soluble target proteins.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="kwd"><kwd>[4Fe-4S]-cluster-containing P-loop NTPase (FSC-NTPase)</kwd><kwd><italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic></kwd><kwd>chloroplast</kwd><kwd>high chlorophyll fluorescence 101 (HCF101)</kwd><kwd>iron-sulfur cluster assembly</kwd><kwd>scaffold protein</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="abbr"><kwd>APO1, accumulation of Photosystem I 1</kwd><kwd>Cfd1, cytosolic iron-sulfur cluster deficient 1</kwd><kwd>DTT, dithiothreitol</kwd><kwd>DUF, domain of unknown function</kwd><kwd>Fe/S, iron-sulfur</kwd><kwd>FSC-NTPase, [4Fe-4S]-cluster-containing P-loop NTPase</kwd><kwd>FTR, ferredoxin-thioredoxin reductase</kwd><kwd>HCF101, high chlorophyll fluorescence 101</kwd><kwd>Ind1, iron-sulfur protein required for NADH dehydrogenase 1</kwd><kwd>IPTG, isopropyl &#x003b2;-<sc>D</sc>-thiogalactoside</kwd><kwd>ISC, iron-sulfur cluster</kwd><kwd>Nbp35, nucleotide-binding protein 35</kwd><kwd>NFS1, NifS-like</kwd><kwd>NIF, nitrogen fixation</kwd><kwd>PSI, Photosystem I</kwd><kwd>SUF, sulfur mobilization</kwd><kwd>WT, wild-type</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="5"/><ref-count count="48"/><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Fe/S clusters (iron-sulfur clusters) are ancient cofactors of proteins required for various essential processes. As Fe/S clusters are able to transfer electrons and act as a catalyst they are important players in processes such as photosynthesis and respiration, nitrogen and sulfur metabolism, redox regulation and sensing, as well as gene expression and hence they are indispensable prosthetic groups of many proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The biogenesis of such clusters from elemental iron and sulfur is an enzymatic process and requires a set of specialized proteins. As a first step sulfur is mobilized from the sulfhydryl group of cysteine, catalysed by a cysteine desulfurase, and elemental iron is relocated from cellular stores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Synthesis of the Fe/S cluster takes place on specialized scaffold proteins, which assemble transiently bound clusters before their transfer to apoproteins. The components responsible for iron-sulfur protein maturation have been mostly characterized in bacteria and yeast and different systems for Fe/S cluster biogenesis have been identified. The Fe/S cluster assembly machinery is present in many bacteria and mitochondria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The SUF (sulfur mobilization) system is active under iron-limiting and oxidative stress situations in bacteria and is also found in plastids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The NIF machinery is dedicated to the assembly of nitrogenase in nitrogen-fixing bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In eukaryotes the mitochondrial Fe/S cluster machinery not only supports the organellular demand for the cofactor but is also required for the assembly of cytosolic and nuclear iron-sulfur proteins. Additionally, proteins of the CIA (cytosolic ironsulfur protein assembly) machinery are essential for Fe/S cluster formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>Several Fe/S cluster-containing proteins in chloroplasts need a specialized set of proteins for Fe/S cluster synthesis as the oxygen-sensitive biosynthesis process takes place within an organelle with a high oxygen concentration. Some of the participating proteins have been identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. A candidate for sulfur mobilization in chloroplasts, CpNifS, has been shown to act as a cysteine desulfurase <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. This process seems to be stimulated by CpSufE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. For the second step in Fe/S cluster assembly the plastid scaffold protein NFU2 [NFU proteins are related to the C-terminal domain of NifU (nitrogen fixation, subunit U)] was demonstrated to carry a [2Fe-2S] cluster, which can be transferred to ferredoxin. As levels of PSI (Photosystem I) are decreased in mutant plants, NFU2 is proposed to be also involved in the assembly of [4Fe-4S] proteins, although the mechanism of maturation remains unclear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Two further plastid scaffold proteins that carry a transient [2Fe-2S] cluster have been identified, CpIscA and two glutaredoxins, GrxS14 and GrxS16, all of which were able to assemble and transfer [2Fe-2S] clusters <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. An IscA homologue in <italic>Synechocystis sp.</italic>, has been shown to assemble a [2Fe-2S] cluster and to reactivate apo-adenylyl sulfate reductase, which requires a [4Fe-4S] cluster for activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. However, to date, plastid candidates, which specifically assemble and transfer [4Fe-4S] clusters have not been described.</p><p>Apart from PSI, which contains three [4Fe-4S] clusters, a number of other chloroplast enzymes depend upon this cofactor, such as the heterodimeric FTR (ferredoxin-thioredoxin reductase) complex, the nitrite and sulfite reductases, and presumably the NAD(P)H dehydrogenase. Two plastid proteins, HCF101 (high chlorophyll fluorescence 101) and APO1 (accumulation of PSI), have been genetically described as essential and specific factors for assembly of [4Fe-4S]-cluster-containing protein complexes, although the molecular mechanism remained unclear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Whereas APO1 function interferes with translation of PSI transcripts <italic>psaA</italic> and <italic>psaB</italic>, HCF101 exerts its function on a post-translational step [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In addition to the lack of PSI, the HCF101 mutants accumulate less heterodimeric FTR complex, whereas levels of [2Fe-2S]-cluster-containing proteins are not affected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. APO1 is only conserved among higher plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], whereas HCF101 belongs to the ancient and ubiquitously distributed protein family of soluble FSC-NTPases ([4Fe-4S]-cluster-containing P-loop NTPases) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Four classes of P-loop FSC-NTPases involved in Fe/S cluster biogenesis have been defined, members of which share a highly conserved protein signature and represent bacterial, plastid, mitochondrial and cytoplasmic proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>Plastid homologues and eubacterial forms with an N-terminal DUF59 [domain of unknown function 59; Pfam number PF01883 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk/">http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk/</ext-link>)] domain belong to FSC-NTPase class I. The mature HCF101 protein, without the predicted transit peptide, contains an N-terminal DUF59 domain and eight cysteine residues along the sequence. All cysteine residues are conserved among higher plants but of the two cysteine residues located in the DUF59 domain only Cys<sup>128</sup> is highly conserved (see Supplementary Figure S1 available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.BiochemJ.org/bj/425/bj4250207add.htm">http://www.BiochemJ.org/bj/425/bj4250207add.htm</ext-link>). The eubacterial representatives of class I can be divided further into subclasses, depending on the presence of the DUF59 domain and the positions of the cysteine residues. Of the eubacterial FSC-NTPase proteins, ApbC in <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> is required for the maturation of the Fe/S cluster proteins present in the thiamine biosynthetic pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Class II members are mitochondrially targeted eukaryotic proteins. Recently, <italic>Yarrowia lipolytica</italic> Ind1 (iron-sulfur protein required for NADH dehydrogenase 1) has been shown to function in the assembly of mitochondrial complex I, possibly acting as a scaffold protein for Fe/S cluster assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. This protein and the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> homologue AtInd1 (also termed HCF101-L1) are localized in mitochondria and share conserved C-terminal cysteine residues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Nbp35 (nucleotide-binding protein 35) and Cfd1 (cytosolic iron-sulfur cluster deficient 1), members of classes III and IV in yeast, have been shown to form a stable complex and to act in [4Fe-4S] cluster assembly in the cytosol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. They both bind a transient [4Fe-4S] cluster at the C-terminus and Nbp35 binds an additional [4Fe-4S] cluster at the N-terminus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Homologous members of the FSC-NTPase family in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, yeast and prokaryotes, which belong to classes II&#x02013;IV share several conserved cysteine residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>) but, strikingly, these are not present in plastid HCF101 forms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Furthermore, characteristic motifs for Fe/S cluster binding, such as CXXC are present in the N- and/or C-termini of cytosolic and mitochondrial proteins in eukaryotes and in eubacteria, e.g. in the <italic>Salmonella</italic> homologue ApbC, but remarkably are lacking in the plastid HCF101 form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Schematic alignment of cysteine residues in members of the FSC-NTPase superfamily in eukaryotes and eubacteria</title><p>The plastid (class I) and mitochondrial (class II) forms in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (HCF101 and AtInd1 respectively), the cytosolic class III and IV homologues (Npb35 and Cfd1 respectively) in yeast and the class I eubacterial homologue ApbC in <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> are represented.

The absolute intensity of the signal in the cells expressing the C128S mutant was much lower than the signal of cells expressing the WT protein.

The integrated intensity amounted to no more than 1% of the HCF101 molecules. Such a species could have been derived from the breakdown of a minor proportion of the [4Fe-4S]<sup>2+</sup> cluster, which could not be detected in the M&#x000f6;ssbauer spectrum. Upon reduction with dithionite a broad rhombic EPR signal with <italic>g</italic> values of 2.02 and 1.93 was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>c, lower trace), which was accompanied by a sharp isotropic (<italic>g</italic>=2.003) radical signal, derived from dithionite breakdown products.

As the latter result was not due to the lack of stability of HCF101 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>a, lower panel), our finding suggests that the Fe/S cluster on HCF101 is not capable of forming when the protein is in the yeast cytosol. To analyse whether the <sup>55</sup>Fe associated with mitochondrially targeted HCF101-Myc was indicative of the binding of an Fe/S cluster, we analysed the dependence of <sup>55</sup>Fe binding on the function of the cysteine desulfurase Nfs1, a central component of the mitochondrial assembly system.

This result shows that the <sup>55</sup>Fe incorporated into HCF101 is part of an Fe/S cluster. Taken together, the radiolabelling experiments in yeast show that HCF101 can also bind an Fe/S cluster in a eukaryotic system, yet its localization to mitochondria is required to achieve significant Fe/S cluster assembly.</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>HCF101 can assemble an Fe/S cluster in yeast mitochondria</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) W303 WT yeast cells were transformed with vectors pRS426-TDH3 encoding a Myc-tagged HCF101 with (Mito) or without (Cyto) an N-terminal F<sub>1</sub>&#x003b2;-ATPase mitochondrial-targeting sequence or with the empty vector (empty).

The protein was previously shown in cell biological experiments to function as an essential factor for assembly of PSI but the mechanism of action remained unknown. Levels of PSI and FTR complexes, harbouring three and one [4Fe-4S] clusters respectively, were significantly diminished in the HCF101 mutant although translation of PSI proteins was not affected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Bacterial, cytosolic and mitochondrial members of the FSC-NTPase family have been described as binding to [4Fe-4S] clusters and their role in Fe/S cluster biogenesis in their particular cell compartments has been documented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. However, despite the overall striking conservation of the protein signatures, surprisingly the typical and conserved Fe/S cluster-binding motifs of all the other FSC-NTPase members was absent in HCF101 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Therefore it was still a matter of debate whether HCF101 had the ability to bind and transfer Fe/S cluster or if it had possibly acquired other functions in the course of evolution. Our results showed that heterologously expressed HCF101 in <italic>E. coli</italic> retained approx. one iron and one sulphur ion per HCF101 monomer after purification, and that after chemical reconstitution approximately four iron and four sulfur ions per HCF101 monomer were present. This is consistent with the binding of a [4Fe-4S] cluster. Indeed, UV&#x02013;visible, M&#x000f6;ssbauer and EPR spectroscopy of reconstituted HCF101 confirmed the presence of a [4Fe-4S] cluster. Interestingly, the reduced species of HCF101 was mainly present in the <italic>S</italic>=3/2 form. This type of EPR signal has been encountered in many proteins which have solvent-exposed clusters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. The property of HCF101 to rapidly transfer of its cluster to apo-Leu1 occurs also supports the hypothesis that its cluster is solvent-exposed rather than buried in the protein. Taken together, in the present study we unequivocally demonstrated, by several methodologies, that despite, the lack of characteristic FSC-NTPase family binding motifs HCF101 harbours a labile [4Fe-4S] cluster.</p><p><italic>In vitro</italic> analyses using site-directed mutagenesis in <italic>E. coli</italic> identified three cysteine residues that are essential for binding the Fe/S cluster. As expected the only cysteine residue that is also conserved in cyanobacteria, Cys<sup>128</sup>, was the most crucial for the assembly/stability of the cluster when expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic>. The other two cysteine residues involved in cluster binding, Cys<sup>347</sup> and Cys<sup>419</sup>, were present in the context of a second cysteine residue, namely as part of a CX<sub>7</sub>C or a CX<sub>4</sub>C motif respectively. These motifs might resemble metal-binding sites. The other two cysteine residues of these motifs are also likely to be involved in Fe/S cluster-binding and/or stabilization as the cluster of the respective purified mutant forms were more unstable compared with the WT protein (results not shown). In contrast with all other FSC-NTPase members a cysteine residue (underlined) is present in the highly conserved P-loop domain of the plant HCF101 (<underline>C</underline>KGGVGKS). This might indicate that there has been a change-of-function for this domain in the plant lineage, although the newly evolved cysteine residue in the P-loop is not essentially required for Fe/S cluster-binding (result not shown). Two Fe/S cluster-binding cysteine residues (Cys<sup>97</sup> and Cys<sup>131</sup>) have also been identified in the homodimeric protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase subunit BchL, a NifH-like protein sharing some sequence similarity with HCF101 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. One of these BchL cysteine residues (Cys<sup>131</sup>) is conserved in HCF101 (Cys<sup>303</sup>), yet might have lost its function as a cluster ligand.</p><p>Nevertheless, with the exception of Cys<sup>128</sup>, which is also conserved in cyanobacteria, all other cysteine residues are not preserved in other organisms (see Supplementary Figure S1) pointing to a specialized plastid form of class I FSC-NTPase proteins. Therefore, HCF101 may represent a divergent type of Fe/S cluster-binding protein, which presumably evolved as an adaptation to oxygen evolution in the chloroplast. So far almost nothing is known about the formation of [4Fe-4S] clusters in plastids and their insertion into PSI and other chloroplast complexes. To clarify the possible function of HCF101 regarding post-translational assembly of PSI, the <italic>in vitro</italic> cluster transfer properties of the [4Fe-4S] cluster on HCF101 was tested. As it is not feasible to establish an <italic>in vitro</italic> assay for the transfer of [4Fe-4S] clusters on the apo-PSI complex or to study Fe/S cluster transfer in a living plant cell, we used the yeast apo-Leu1 as a model target protein. HCF101 efficiently transferred its cluster to apo-Leu1 demonstrating that it binds its [4Fe-4S] cluster in a labile fashion. These results suggest that HCF101 could transfer its Fe/S cluster to apoproteins in chloroplasts. Whether the HCF101 function is specific for [4Fe-4S] clusters, cannot be derived from <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments due to the limitations of the <italic>in vitro</italic> Fe/S cluster experiments. Nevertheless, it is generally accepted that the ability to rapidly and efficiently transfer Fe/S cluster(s) <italic>in vitro</italic> to acceptor apoproteins is an essential prerequisite for scaffold function of an Fe/S cluster-containing protein. As an alternative scaffold protein NFU2, which binds [2Fe-2S] clusters has been described in chloroplasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Somewhat surprisingly, <italic>Arabidopsis nfu2</italic> mutants also have a PSI defect, even though these plants exhibit a much milder phenotype than <italic>hcf101</italic> plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. At present, it is unknown whether NFU2 can assemble [4Fe-4S] clusters by itself, or facilitates transfer of the assembled [2Fe-2S] clusters on to HCF101, thus forming transient [4Fe-4S] clusters.</p><p>Our biochemical studies suggest that HCF101 can assemble a [4Fe-4S] cluster and transfer it to apoproteins. It is thus conceivable that this protein fulfils a similar function to the Cfd1&#x02013;Nbp35 complex, which performs a scaffold role in cytosolic and nuclear iron-sulfur protein assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], or to the mitochondrial Ind1 involved in Fe/S cluster incorporation into respiratory complex I [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Strikingly, the motifs which transiently bind the Fe/S clusters in these latter proteins differ markedly from that in HCF101. Future studies therefore will have to uncover the precise structure of Fe/S cluster-bound HCF101. Moreover, whether Fe/S cluster assembly on HCF101 occurs spontaneously in the plastid has to be addressed, i.e. whether HCF101 serves as a true scaffold or whether Fe/S cluster assembly depends on other scaffolds such as NFU1, NFU2 and NFU3, or the SufA-type scaffolds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>], and functions as a so-called carrier for delivering the cluster to [4Fe-4S] apoproteins.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Online data</title><supplementary-material id="SD1" content-type="local-data" position="float" xlink:type="simple"><caption><title>Supplementary data</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bj4250207add.pdf" position="float" xlink:type="simple"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><sec><title>AUTHOR CONTRIBUTION</title><p>Serena Schwenkert, Daili Netz, and Jeverson Frazzon performed the biochemical analysis.
