All CpG dinucleotide sequences are represented by vertical bars across the horizontal line depicting the promoter sequence.

As indicated, 3 of 7 ACVR2-negative CRCs demonstrated complete methylation of the critical region of ACVR2 promoter, while none of the ACVR2-expressing tumors showed any evidence for high degree/complete methylation of ACVR2 promoter.

Loss of ACVR2 protein expression was also noted in a small subset of MSS colon cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008308-Jung1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Here, we assessed the occurrence and mechanism of disrupted activin signaling in MSS colon cancers and demonstrate that activin signaling is targeted for disruption at multiple levels in MSS colon tumors. Most commonly, <italic>ACVR2</italic> expression is lost via a combination of LOH and epigenetic silencing of the <italic>ACVR2</italic> promoter. These findings underscore the importance of abrogated activin signaling in colon tumorigenesis, as its disruption occurs in both MSI and MSS subtypes of colon cancer by differing distinct mechanisms.</p><p>In MSI-H colon cancers, both TGF&#x003b2; and activin are abrogated due to frameshift mutations in the type II receptor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008308-Jung1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008308-Grady2">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>.

Both TGF&#x003b2; and activin use the same intracellular SMAD proteins (SMAD 2 and 3) to transmit their signal. We previously observed greater than 50&#x00025; overlap between <italic>ACVR2</italic> and <italic>TGFBR2</italic> mutations in primary MSI colon tumors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008308-Jung1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, possibly because of additive effects in mediating the growth response, which are currently under investigation.</p><p>It appears that in MSI colon cancers <italic>ACVR2</italic> mutations may occur early in tumorigenesis and are associated with increased local growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008308-Jung3">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. In MSS colon cancers, loss of ACVR2 correlated with larger tumors, consistent with disruption of activin-induced growth suppression. The timing of <italic>ACVR2</italic> mutations in MSI colon cancer may be similar to that of <italic>TGFBR2</italic> in which the frameshift mutations occur in high grade dysplasia at the interface to malignancy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008308-Grady2">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>We show that in MSS colon cancers at least three members of the activin signaling cascade, ACVR2, ACVR1, and pSMAD2 are disrupted. A significant subset of colon tumors displayed a decrease in phosphorylated SMAD with intact ACVR2 and TGFBR2, indicating a separate primary event downstream of the primary receptors. One case of loss of ACVR1, ACVR2 and pSMAD2 was identified, which was TGFBR2 staining positive (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0008308-t002">Table 2</xref>). This could be due to primary inactivation of pSMAD2 and separate targeting of both activin receptors, or an IHC positive truncated TGFBR2, leading pSMAD2 loss. The effect of loss of multiple targets of the same signaling cascade still needs to be carefully explored and suggests distinct functions of each member.</p><p>We detected LOH at the <italic>ACVR2</italic> locus in 6&#x00025; of MSS colon tumors, increasing to 50&#x00025; in tumors with loss of ACVR2 protein expression. This overall rate is slightly lower than the frequency of <italic>ACVR2</italic> LOH reported previously in a cohort with unknown <italic>ACVR2</italic> status <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008308-Olaru1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, although we have previously observed cohort-dependent frequencies for ACVR2 expression that may be stage or race-dependent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008308-Jung3">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Our mutational analysis focused on hotspots akin to those implicated in inactivation of the <italic>TGFBR2</italic> kinase domain inactivation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008308-Grady1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, but we did not find any tumor-associated mutations when sequencing all exons in ACVR2 expressing and non-expressing colon cancer cell lines. It is possible that mutations outside of the hotspots may contribute to loss of ACVR2 in primary colon cancer specimens, although in light of the evidence for LOH as well as epigenetic silencing, this is likely to be a less important tumorigenic mechanism. However, it may play a role in the three tumors with loss of ACVR2 where we found no genetic or epigenetic mechanism directly explaining that loss.</p><p>This is the first report describing ACVR2 loss in MSS colon cancers and <italic>ACVR2</italic> promoter hypermethylation as a mechanism, and contrasts with the mechanisms of <italic>ACVR2</italic> loss in the MSI colon cancer cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008308-Jung2">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. In both primary MSS colon tumors and in HT29 colon cancer cells, the region of promoter hypermethylation that is associated with loss of <italic>ACVR2</italic> expression is between nucleotides &#x02212;1297 to &#x02212;958. Among genes that are targets for epigenetic silencing, <italic>hMLH1</italic> is the best studied for methylation, and it has been proposed that the promoter region adjacent to the transcription start site (TSS) is critical for transcriptional silencing of this gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008308-Deng1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. There is lack of similar data for most other genes, but <italic>hMLH1</italic> promoter region data is often used as a paradigm, and it is believed that for most genes, analysis of a similar promoter region is critical to correlate DNA methylation findings with loss of gene expression. In this study, we have analyzed &#x0003e;1500 bp proximal to the TSS, and found good correlation between <italic>ACVR2</italic> promoter methylation (in regions &#x02212;958 to &#x02212;1297) and loss of protein expression by IHC. Our data suggests that instead of mere proximity to the TSS, differential access to methylation co-activators or repressors in a promoter determines gene silencing, and for <italic>ACVR2</italic> such a region may occur upwards of 900 bp from the TSS.</p><p>We are mindful that the total number of MSS patients with ACVR2 loss that were investigated in this study is not large, underscoring that this is a relatively infrequent event <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008308-SatiaAbouta1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. We did not intend to determine the overall frequencies of such events, but to show an alternative mechanism of ACVR2 protein loss in MSS colon cancers. Of 51 primary, population-based MSS tumor samples, 7 showed loss of ACVR2 expression. In keeping with the 51 subjects being randomly drawn from the cohort, between 7&#x00025; and 21&#x00025; of MSS tumors in the population should show similar loss of ACVR2 expression with 95&#x00025; confidence (Clopper-Pearson exact confidence interval). Increasing the sample size to 77 revealed loss of ACVR2 in 12/77 or 16&#x00025; and a statistically significant correlation of loss of ACVR2 with increased tumor size. Further, genomic subtype analysis revealed that LOH at <italic>ACVR2</italic> was associated with the CIN phenotype, while <italic>ACVR2</italic> hypermethylation correlated with the CIMP phenotype. While these categorizations allow attribution of loss of <italic>ACVR2</italic> expression to promoter hypermethylation and/or chromosomal instability as a mechanism in MSS cancers, alternative mechanisms such as histone modification and/or microRNAs may be at play, particularly in the LOH negative/methylation negative cancers. Our data however, show a significant correlation between loss of ACVR2 expression and LOH/epigenetic silencing. Thus we provide evidence for the existence of either chromosomal instability or epigenetic modification of <italic>ACVR2</italic> in colon cancer and identify a cell model for epigenetic silencing of <italic>ACVR2</italic>. The full clinical impact of this data will require further confirmation in future studies with larger patient samples.</p><p>In conclusion, loss of ACVR2, ACVR1 and pSMAD2 expression occurs in a subset of MSS tumors, and the evidence supports that this results in abrogation of the normal growth suppressive activity of activin signaling. Decreased pSMAD2 is commonly associated with wild type ACVR2 and ACVR1. Mechanisms for <italic>ACVR2</italic> loss include LOH at <italic>ACVR2</italic> and <italic>ACVR2</italic> promoter hypermethylation between nucleotides &#x02212;1297 and &#x02212;958, which are associated with CIN and CIMP phenotypes, respectively. Loss of ACVR2 is associated with increased tumor size. Therefore, activin signaling can be inactivated by distinctive mechanisms in MSI and MSS colon cancers, suggesting the importance of this pathway in controlling colonocyte growth.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>This study was conducted according to the principles expressed in the Declaration of Helsinki.
