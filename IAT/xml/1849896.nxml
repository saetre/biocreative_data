Depletion of Rrp14p inhibited pre-rRNA synthesis on both the 40S and 60S synthesis pathways. Synthesis of the 20S precursor to the 18S rRNA was largely blocked, as was maturation of the 27SB pre-rRNA to the 5.8S and 25S rRNAs. Unexpectedly, Rrp14p-depleted cells also showed apparently specific cell-cycle defects. Following release from synchronization in S phase, Rrp14p-depleted cells uniformly arrested in metaphase with short mitotic spindles that were frequently incorrectly aligned with the site of bud formation. In the absence of Bub2p, which is required for the spindle orientation checkpoint, this metaphase arrest was not seen in Rrp14p-depleted cells, which then arrested with multiple buds, several SPBs and binucleate mother cells. These data suggest that Rrp14p may play some role in cell polarity and/or spindle positioning, in addition to its function in ribosome synthesis.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The majority of steps in ribosome synthesis take place within the nucleolus, a specialized subnuclear structure. In the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, the nucleolus is formed around the highly repetitive rDNA array on chromosome XII. Here, the rDNA is transcribed into a large precursor RNA (pre-rRNA), which is subsequently modified and then matured by endonuclease and exonuclease processing to yield the mature 18S, 5.8S and 25S rRNAs (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Ribosome synthesis is a major activity in the Eukaryotic cell and a rapidly growing yeast cell produces around 2000 ribosomes per minute. Both the size of the cell at division and number of ribosomes per cell, are closely linked to growth rate [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>)]. Moreover, both size at division and ribosome numbers anticipate the future growth rate suggesting a cross-talk mechanism between ribosome synthesis and mitotic cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>). Recent studies in yeast have identified several connections among the nucleolus, ribosome biogenesis and cell-cycle progression [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>)]. A small number of ribosomal processing factors were found that appear to facilitate cross-talk between those processes, with mutations in these proteins affecting both ribosome synthesis and cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>).</p><p>Ykl082c/Rrp14p is an essential protein that was initially characterized in two-hybrid analyses of a protein interaction network involved in the specification of cell polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>). Rrp14p interacted with Bud8p, a component of the distal bud site tag complex, Zds2p, a nucleolar protein with a role in cell polarity as well as gene silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>), and with Gic1p and Gic2p, which interact directly with the GTPase Cdc42, a key regulator of cell polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>). Stains carrying <italic>gic1/2&#x00394;</italic> have a depolarized actin and microtubule cytoskeleton, implicating these proteins in microtubule polarization and nuclear migration. Rrp14p was therefore proposed to be involved in polarized growth and the establishment of bud sites, although direct physical interactions were not assessed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>).</p><p>YFP-tagged Rrp14p was found to localize to the nucleolus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>), and we subsequently identified Rrp14p as a component of an early pre-60S complex that was co-purified with tagged Ssf1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>), suggesting a role in ribosome synthesis. Rrp14p is a member of the SURF-6 family of nucleolar proteins, which have been predicted from bioinformatic analyses to participate in complex protein&#x02013;protein and protein&#x02013;RNA interactions within the nucleolus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>).</p><p>Here we report that Rrp14p functions in ribosome synthesis; it is required for the maturation of both small and large subunit rRNAs and helps to prevent premature cleavage of the pre-rRNA at site C<sub>2</sub>. Strains depleted of Rrp14p also show defects in positioning and elongation of the mitotic spindle during mitosis, which were not previously reported for cells depleted for any other ribosome synthesis factor.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Strains and molecular techniques</title><p>Standard techniques were employed for growth and handling of yeast.

Cells were then transferred to pre-warmed glucose medium lacking alpha-factor but containing 0.1 M hydroxyurea for a further 2 h. Cells were released from arrest into pre-warmed glucose medium. Samples, taken after 0, 20, 40 and 60 min, were fixed by incubation in 4% (v/v) formaldehyde at 25&#x000b0;C for 3 min for SPB visualization, or 1 h for tubulin, Cdc14&#x02013;GFP and Nop1p detection, and then spheroplasted.

To determine whether Rrp14p is associated with pre-ribosomal particles, we constructed a strain expressing a C-terminal fusion between a TAP tag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>) and Rrp14p. The fusion construct was inserted into the genome under the control of the <italic>RRP14</italic> promoter and supported wild-type growth, showing it to be functional (data not shown). To assess the association of Rrp14p with pre-ribosomal particles, a sucrose gradient analysis was performed with a lysate from the Rrp14-TAP strain. The sedimentation of Rrp14-TAP was determined by western blotting with antibodies that recognize the protein A moiety of the TAP tag, and compared with the rRNA species and pre-rRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Comparison with the positions of the mature rRNAs detected by ethidium staining (data not shown and indicated by bars on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) and the pre-rRNAs indicated that Rrp14-TAP is most enriched in the 60S region of the gradient, with a weaker peak &#x0223c;80&#x02013;90S. No cosedimentation with the 20S pre-rRNA was observed, indicating that Rrp14p is not associated with 40S pre-ribosomes. These analyses are consistent with the previous proteomic data indicating that Rrp14p is present in pre-60S particles, but additionally suggest an association with 90S pre-ribosomes, within which the early assembly of the 40S subunit occurs.</p></sec><sec><title>Rrp14p is required for rRNA synthesis</title><p>To determine the requirement for Rrp14p in rRNA synthesis, we integrated an N-terminal HA&#x02013;Rrp14p fusion construct under the control of the repressible <italic>GAL1</italic> promoter at the endogenous <italic>RRP14</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>) (see Materials and Methods). The <italic>GAL::HA-rrp14</italic> strain grew more slowly than the isogenic wild type in galactose media, indicating that Rrp14p over-expression is toxic. However, growth of the <italic>GAL::HA-rrp14</italic> strains was identical to the wild type in RGS medium (containing raffinose, sucrose and galactose), which results in lower expression levels, and shortly after transfer to glucose medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), showing the HA-fusion construct to be functional. Growth of the <italic>GAL::HA-rrp14</italic> strain was strongly reduced 6 h after transfer to glucose media and had almost ceased by 12 h. Consistent with this, western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) showed that HA&#x02013;Rrp14p was strongly depleted after 6 h in glucose and undetectable after 12 h.</p><p>Pre-rRNA processing was initially assessed by pulse-chase labeling <italic>in vivo</italic> with [5,6-<sup>3</sup>H]uracil 7 h after transfer to glucose medium. Analysis of high molecular weight RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) showed that in the Rrp14p-depleted strain 35S and 32S pre-rRNAs accumulated, whereas the 27SA pre-rRNA was less abundant and its conversion to 27SB and mature 25S rRNA was greatly reduced. The level of 20S pre-rRNA was reduced with the concomitant appearance of the aberrant 23S molecule and synthesis of mature 18S was both delayed and reduced. The 23S RNA originates from direct cleavage of the 35S pre-rRNA at site A<sub>3</sub> when the cleavages at sites A<sub>0</sub>, A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>2</sub> are delayed.</p><p>The formation of low molecular weight rRNAs (5S and 5.8S) was analyzed by PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). In the Rrp14p-depleted strain, the 7S pre-rRNA was not readily detected and very low levels of the mature 5.8S rRNA accumulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). The mature 5.8S<sub>L</sub> and 5.8S<sub>S</sub> are the products of alternative processing pathways. No change in their ratio was seen, indicating that Rrp14p is required for 27SB pre-rRNA processing in both pathways.</p><p>To further characterize pre-rRNA processing in the <italic>GAL::HA-rrp14</italic> mutant strain, steady-state levels of mature and precursor rRNA molecules were assessed by northern hybridization of RNAs resolved on agarose gels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>)or polyacrylamide gels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Rrp14p-depletion led to strong accumulation of the 35S pre-RNA and appearance of the 23S RNA, whereas levels of the 27SA<sub>2</sub> and 20S pre-rRNAs were reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), consistent with inhibition of cleavage at sites A<sub>0</sub>, A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>2</sub>. An aberrant RNA, which is predicted to extend from the end of the 5&#x02032; ETS to site D, was also accumulated (5&#x02032;ETS-D in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) and a band of appropriate mobility was seen in the pulse-chase labeling (marked with asterisk in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). This species is presumably generated by pre-rRNA processing in ITS1 and 3&#x02032; maturation of 18S rRNA, in the absence of processing in the 5&#x02032;ETS. On the pathway of 60S synthesis, the 27SB pre-rRNA was not strongly reduced at the 4 and 8 h depletion time points, whereas the mature 25S was depleted, showing that its maturation was prevented. Analyses of low molecular weight RNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) showed that levels of the later 7S and 6S pre-rRNAs were reduced, with a more rapid effect on 6S. In addition, an aberrant species that extend from A<sub>2</sub> to C<sub>2</sub> was accumulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, panel a), which results from premature cleavage of the 27SA<sub>2</sub> pre-rRNA at site C<sub>2</sub>. The appearance of the A<sub>2</sub>&#x02013;C<sub>2</sub> fragment was described previously in strains lacking Ssf1p and Ssf2p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>) and other pre-60S components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>).</p><p>We conclude that Rrp14 is required for pre-rRNA maturation on both the 40S and 60S pathways.</p></sec><sec><title>Rrp14p depletion arrests cell-cycle progression</title><p>Rrp14p was reported to interact with proteins required for cell polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>). We, therefore, inspected cells undergoing Rrp14p depletion by microscopy, to determine whether they arrest at a specific stage of the cell cycle. Following transfer to glucose medium for 6 h, 62% of <italic>GAL::HA-rrp14</italic> cells (from 650 cells examined) showed a distinctive and unusual morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, panel g). The cells were arrested with large buds, which were generally more elongated than those seen in the wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, panels a&#x02013;d) or in <italic>GAL::HA-rrp14</italic> cells growing in permissive, RGS medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, panel e). Cell-cycle arrest with large, elongated buds was previously reported for cells defective in the mitotic exit network (MEN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>) or depleted of the ribosome synthesis factor Nop15p, which causes an arrest at cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>). However, in each of these cases the cells arrest with separated nuclei whereas Rrp14p-depleted cells arrest with a single nucleus, as shown by DAPI staining of the DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, panel h). These observations suggested that, in addition to its role in ribosome synthesis, Rrp14p is required at a specific step in cell-cycle progression, after commitment to bud formation but before nuclear division.</p><p>To better analyze this defect, wild-type and <italic>GAL::rrp14</italic> cells were synchronized in early S phase using alpha-factor, followed by hydroxyurea (HU) arrest and release. Commencing 2 h after transfer to glucose medium, cells were initially pre-synchronized at the G<sub>1</sub> to S phase boundary by alpha-factor treatment for 2 h, and then released from the alpha-factor block into HU for 2 h. Following HU release, wild-type cells proceeded rapidly through nuclear separation and cell division, as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>). In contrast, 97% of Rrp14p-depleted cells (from 650 cells examined) were arrested before nuclear separation during the first round of cell division. Formation and elongation of the mitotic spindle was examined by staining with a rabbit anti-tubulin antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, panels b and e; quantified in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1a</xref>). In Rrp14p-depleted cells, the spindle poles were duplicated and clearly separated, but were closely positioned, indicating arrest during elongation of the mitotic spindle. In 68% of arrested cells the spindle was within or adjacent to the bud neck with either correct or perpendicular orientation. Strikingly, however, 29% of Rrp14p-depleted cells had spindles that did not lie close to the bud-neck and were apparently randomly positioned in the mother cell cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1a</xref>). Furthermore, cytoplasmic microtubules (MTs) were not visible.</p><p>In wild-type cells the spindle pole body (SPB) is normally localized adjacent to the site of the developing bud, and this is an important determinant of cell polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>). The mislocalization of the SPB in cells lacking Rrp14p would be consistent with a function in cell polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>).</p><p>In wild-type cells undergoing mitosis, Cdc14p is released from the nucleolus into the nucleoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>). To follow its location, a Cdc14p&#x02013;GFP fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>) (kindly provided by E. Schiebel) was expressed in the wild-type and <italic>GAL::HA-rrp14</italic> strains. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1b</xref>, by 40 min after HU release Cdc14p&#x02013;GFP had delocalized from the nucleolus to the nucleoplasm in 89% of wild-type cells (from 400 examined) but remained restricted to the nucleolus in all Rrp14p-depleted cells.</p><p>Since Rrp14p is normally nucleolar, we checked the location and integrity of the nucleolus in the Rrp14p-depleted cells by immunofluorescence with antibodies against the nucleolar marker Nop1p. Anti-Nop1p decorated a crescent-shaped region slightly displaced from the DAPI-stained nucleoplasm, in a pattern characteristic of the normal yeast nucleolus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). The nucleolus and nucleoplasm both remained undivided in the Rrp14p-depleted cells following HU release. In wild-type cells, the nucleolus is predominately localized opposite the SPB during interphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>), but moves to a position perpendicular to the mitotic spindle before division. In 76% of Rrp14p-depleted cells (from 600 cells examined) this reorganization did not occur, as shown by the position of the Nop1p signal opposite the bud site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, panel c).</p><p>To confirm the conclusions on the defects in the localization of the mitotic spindle, the <italic>GAL::HA-rrp14</italic> mutation was combined with a construct expressing a fusion between the SPB protein Spc42p and green fluorescent protein (GFP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>; quantified in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). In the wild-type strain 40 min after HU release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, panels a&#x02013;d), the nucleus and SPBs had been segregated and migrated into the bud. In contrast, in the Rrp14p-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, panels e&#x02013;h) the SPBs had not segregated and were not correctly aligned with the bud site.</p><p>Defects in either the structure of the mitotic spindle or in the attachment of chromosomes to the spindle are sensed by checkpoint systems, leading to cell-cycle arrest at metaphase with short spindles, as seen in Rrp14p-depleted cells [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>)]. There are two distinct spindle checkpoint pathways in yeast responding to separable MT-dependent events; the Mad2p pathway or spindle assembly checkpoint, and the Bub2p or spindle orientation checkpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>). To assess whether either of these pathways was responsible for the observed cell-cycle arrest, <italic>GAL::HA-rrp14</italic> was combined with the <italic>mad2&#x00394;</italic> and <italic>bub2&#x00394;</italic> deletions. The <italic>mad2&#x00394;</italic> single mutation had little effect on spindle formation in the <italic>RRP14</italic><sup>+</sup> strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7</xref>, panels i&#x02013;l, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>, panels a&#x02013;c, and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). When Rrp14p was depleted from the <italic>mad2&#x00394;</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7</xref>, panels m&#x02013;p, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>, panels d&#x02013;f) the phenotype closely resembled the depletion of Rrp14p alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, panels e&#x02013;h) with no increase in spindle elongation or the frequency of nuclear division, and a similar fraction of cells contained a spindle and nucleus that were not located near the bud neck (30% of 650 cells counted) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, panels m&#x02013;p, and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>).</p><p>The <italic>bub2&#x00394;</italic> single mutant also showed no effect on spindle formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7</xref>, panels q&#x02013;t, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>, panels g&#x02013;i, and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>), but clearly exacerbated the phenotype when Rrp14p was depleted. Ninety-six percent of cells (from 650 cells counted) displayed abnormal spindle orientation with the majority of cells (66%) also containing multiple SPBs, deformed nuclei or binucleate mother cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7</xref>,panels u&#x02013;x, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>, panels j&#x02013;l, and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). Many cells apparently continued to bud despite the defect in cell division, forming chains of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7</xref>, panels x, x&#x02032;, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>, panel l). We conclude that activation of the Bub2p spindle checkpoint is responsible for the cell-cycle arrest in cells depleted of Rrp14p.</p><p>Recent reports have implicated other 60S ribosome synthesis factors in the mechanism of DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>). A failure to undergo DNA replication following HU release would potentially explain some, but not all, of the defects observed in Rrp14p-depleted cells. DNA replication was followed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis at intervals following release from HU arrest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). In unsynchronized cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>) the two major peaks correspond to cells with unreplicated (1C) and duplicated (2C) genomes. In both the wild type and mutant, the HU-induced block was efficient with most cells arrested with a 1C genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref> and C). In the wild type, most cells had undergone DNA replication 20 min after HU release, and almost all after 40 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). By 60 min after HU release, haploid cells that have completed mitosis were reappearing. In the Rrp14p-depleted cells, DNA replication is slower, with more cells remaining 1C or in S phase at 20 and 40 min after release than in the wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>). However, at 40 min after HU release, the time at which the microscopy presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref> was performed, most cells appear to have completed DNA replication, indicating that this is unlikely to be the major cause of the cell-cycle arrest in Rrp14p-depleted cells. In the <italic>GAL::HA-rrp14</italic> strain the absence of Mad2p or Bub2p had no clear effects on DNA replication, nor did loss of the genome integrity check point protein Mec1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>) (data not shown).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Here we report that yeast Rrp14p functions in the synthesis of both 40S and 60S ribosomal subunits and may also play some direct role in cell-cycle progression through G<sub>2</sub>/M. Rrp14p was identified as a putative participant in 60S ribosomal subunit synthesis by its co-precipitation with early pre-60S particles that were associated with TAP-tagged Ssf1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>) and Rrp1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>). However, gradient analyses indicate that Rrp14p also associates with the earlier 90S pre-ribosomes, which include many of the factors required for 40S ribosome synthesis. In addition to inhibiting rRNA maturation, loss of Rrp14p apparently allowed premature cleavage of both the 35S and 27SA<sub>2</sub> pre-rRNAs. We speculate that Rrp14p binds late pre-90S particles and then remains associated with the pre-60S region. As well as promoting correct maturation of both subunits, Rrp14p might act to suppress ITS1 and ITS2 cleavage until other maturation steps have occurred.</p><p>In addition to their unusual pre-rRNA processing defects, cells depleted of Rrp14p showed striking cell-cycle-related phenotypes. It is difficult to exclude the possibility that these are an indirect consequence of reduced ribosomal subunit abundances. However, this seems unlikely because no similar phenotypes have been reported for any of the large number of ribosome synthesis factors previously analyzed. This phenotype is certainly not expected to result from the inhibition of translation <italic>per se</italic>, which leads to cell-cycle arrest at the &#x02018;Start&#x02019; check point at the G<sub>1</sub>&#x02013;S boundary and this is also seen in many strains with ribosome synthesis defects [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>) and reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>)]. Rrp14p was initially characterized in two hybrid analyses of a protein interaction network involved in the specification of cell polarity, and was predicted to be involved in polarized growth and the establishment of bud sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>). Although these authors did not demonstrate the physical association of Rrp14p with proteins direct involved in cell polarity, their conclusions are at least consistent with our observations.</p><p>Synchronized Rrp14p-depleted cells arrest with an undivided nucleus and short spindles, a phenotype characteristic of arrest at the G<sub>2</sub>/M boundary. Moreover, the spindles are often misaligned with the bud axis, and the nuclei frequently fail to migrate to the bud neck. In wild-type cells the nucleolus moves during mitosis from its S phase location opposite the bud neck to a position perpendicular to the bud neck (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>). In most Rrp14p-depleted cells the nucleolus was incorrectly positioned, remaining located opposite the bud neck. The cytoplasmic MT asters, which normally form on the cytoplasmic face of the SPBs, were also absent in Rrp14p-depleted cells.</p><p>In several mutant strains cell-cycle arrest during mitosis has been shown to be a consequence of activation of checkpoints, which respond to defects in DNA replication, spindle structure or spindle orientation. A mild delay in DNA replication was seen in Rrp14p-depleted cells, but this was very much less marked than the inhibition seen in cells depleted of another 60S synthesis factor, Yph1p, which associates with the DNA origin of replication complex (ORC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>). Moreover, 40 min after release from HU arrest, most Rrp14p-depleted cells have completed DNA replication, as judged by FACS analysis, but all are arrested at G<sub>2</sub>/M as judged by their morphology. It is therefore unlikely that a failure in DNA replication is responsible for the cell-cycle arrest.</p><p>Defects in the structure of the mitotic spindle or its attachment to chromosomal centromeres are monitored by the Mad2p-dependent spindle checkpoint, while defects in spindle orientation activate a Bub2p-dependent checkpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>) [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>)]. To determine whether either of these checkpoints arrests Rrp14p-depleted cells, we deleted the genes encoding Mad2p and Bub2p. The absence of Mad2p had no clear effects on the growth, DNA replication or morphology of Rrp14p-depleted cells. In contrast, the absence of Bub2p from Rrp14p-depleted cells led to the formation of cells containing multiple SPBs, binucleate mother cells and cell chains, presumably due to ongoing bud formation and SPB duplication without cell division. This observation indicates that the defect in the orientation of the spindles in Rrp14p-depleted cells is responsible for the cell-cycle arrest.</p><p>RNAs have been identified in the centrioles of surf clams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>), whereas RNA species associate with mitotic MTs in <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts and spindle assembly is promoted by the RNA export factor Rae1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>), which is structurally related to the spindle checkpoint protein Bub3p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>). Yeast Rae1p (Gle2p) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref>) is implicated in the export of ribosomal subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">59</xref>), but potential interactions with Rrp14p have not been directly assessed. Furthermore, a proteomic analysis of 60S pre-ribosomal particles isolated from human cells identified MT-associated proteins as components of the complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">60</xref>).</p><p>Together these data suggest that in other systems RNA molecules associate with mitotic spindles, and it is at least conceivable that RNAs&#x02014;and therefore RNA-binding proteins&#x02014;also play some role in yeast spindle dynamics.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Elmar Schiebel for the Cdc14&#x02013;GFP construct, Mensur Dlakic for Rrp14p alignment studies, Vincent Archambault for the <italic>mec1&#x00394;/sml1&#x00394;</italic> strain and Fred Cross for the <italic>bub2&#x00394;</italic> strain.
