We report a genotype-associated differential expression of <italic>Hectd2</italic> mRNA in mouse brains and human lymphocytes and a significant up-regulation of transcript in mice at the terminal stage of prion disease. Although the substrate of HECTD2 is unknown, these data highlight the importance of proteosome-directed protein degradation in neurodegeneration. This is the first demonstration of a mouse quantitative trait gene that also influences susceptibility to human prion diseases. Characterisation of such genes is key to understanding human risk and the molecular basis of incubation periods.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Prion diseases are fatal transmissible neurodegenerative diseases of animals and humans for which there is no treatment. They include Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE), and its human equivalent, variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD). Prion diseases are characterised by a long, silent incubation period before the disease emerges, and this time interval varies greatly between individuals. Differences in our genetic makeup are a key factor in this variability. We already know that natural variation within one key gene, the prion protein gene, has a major influence on incubation time, but it is now clear that a number of other genes are also important. Using a mouse model, we have identified one of these genes, <italic>Hectd2</italic>, which is thought to be involved in the process that removes unwanted proteins from the cell. We also show that <italic>HECTD2</italic> is associated with an increased risk of two human prion diseases&#x02014;vCJD in the United Kingdom and kuru in Papua New Guinea. These data will give us a better understanding of the fundamental processes involved in these diseases and go some way to explaining why some individuals exposed to BSE have developed vCJD and others have not.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Prion diseases are fatal transmissible neurodegenerative disorders of animals and humans. These include the agriculturally and economically important diseases of scrapie and Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) and the human diseases sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), variant (vCJD) and kuru. Sporadic CJD has no known aetiology and vCJD is thought to have arisen following exposure to BSE prions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000383-Collinge1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Kuru is a prion disease that reached epidemic proportions in the 1950s in the Fore linguistic region of Papua New Guinea and is thought to have been transmitted through endocannibalism by participation in mortuary feasts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000383-Collinge2">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Following the cessation of this practice in the late 1950's, the incidence of disease has declined, however, it remains our only experience of a large epidemic of acquired human prion disease and provides a useful model for vCJD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000383-Collinge3">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Although there was widespread population exposure in the UK and some other countries to BSE only around 200 have developed clinical vCJD to date, although the number infected remains unknown. This represents an on-going public health concern with a risk of iatrogenic transmission through blood and surgical instruments. vCJD has not been associated with any unusual pattern of dietary or occupational exposure to BSE prions and a significant genetic component to risk seems probable therefore the identification of susceptibility factors is key to estimating individual risk <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000383-Collinge1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>All prion diseases have prolonged clinically silent incubation periods which in humans span over 50 years <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000383-Collinge2">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Marked variation in incubation period occurs between inbred lines of mice and this is determined by multiple genetic loci in addition to the prion protein gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000383-Carlson1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000383-Lloyd1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref></p><p>Previous studies have identified several quantitative trait loci for prion disease incubation time in mice. However, the resulting regions of interest spanned many megabases and were consequently too large for individual candidate gene analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000383-Lloyd2">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000383-Moreno1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>.

These are produced to model an out-bred population of mice, however they have the advantage of starting with a defined number of parental alleles. Heterogeneous stocks of mice have been shown to be a useful mapping tool because they provide a high level of recombination and the development of specific mapping software allows for convenient multipoint linkage analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000383-Valdar1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000383-Talbot1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. This approach led to the identification of <italic>Hectd2</italic>, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, as a quantitative trait gene for prion disease incubation time. Mouse models are extremely useful for studying human prion diseases as they faithfully recapitulate many key features of the disease and indeed rodents are naturally susceptible to prion diseases. It is expected that susceptibility genes and pathways identified in mice will also be relevant to human prion diseases. To test this hypothesis we carried out an association study with <italic>HECTD2</italic> markers and samples from different human prion diseases and successfully found a significant association with two acquired forms of prion disease: vCJD and kuru.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Identification of Mouse Quantitative Trait Gene</title><p>To fine map regions thought to contain quantitative trait loci for prion disease incubation time we utilised the Northport heterogeneous stock <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000383-Hitzemann1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref> (HS) of mice (gift of Robert Hitzemann), which was produced by semi-randomly mating eight inbred lines of mice (A/J, AKR/J, BALB/cJ, C3H/HeJ, C57BL/6J, CBA/J, DBA/2J, LP/J).

Sequencing was not exhaustive and focused primarily on the exons including 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032;UTRs, intron/exon boundaries and potential promoters as defined by the literature for each gene or PROSCAN (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www-bimas.cit.nih.gov/molbio/proscan">http://www-bimas.cit.nih.gov/molbio/proscan</ext-link>). 177 polymorphisms were identified across the region which included single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), simple repeats and insert/deletion polymorphisms. Most of the variation was observed in non-coding regions, however, several non-synonymous changes were seen (for detail see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000383.s006">Table S4</xref>).

We tested whether genetic variation at <italic>HECTD2</italic> was associated with a phenotype of variant and sporadic CJD. In Papua New Guinea (PNG) we genotyped patients who died from the epidemic prion disease kuru, transmitted by endocannibalism, and compared these data with elderly women known to have had multiple exposures to kuru at mortuary feasts prior to the cessation of endocannibalism in the late 1950's, but who are long-term survivors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000383-Collinge2">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000383-Mead1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>.

Given that sample sizes are necessarily small in both sporadic and variant CJD, these data are consistent with the association of <italic>rs12249854</italic> with risk in both prion disease categories and a large effect size. We went on to test whether the risk <italic>rs12249854</italic> allele modified the phenotype of human prion disease. Although the age of onset of sporadic CJD with <italic>rs12249854</italic>AA was younger than other genotypes (53.5 years Vs 68.8 years for <italic>rs12249854</italic>AT and 69.0 years for <italic>rs12249854</italic>TT, <italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.048 <italic>t</italic>-test), this genotype was rare (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;3) and the finding therefore was not robust.

Insufficient data were available to look at any association with duration of illness.</p><p>We went on to analyse a further seven SNPs in <italic>HECTD2</italic> selected to capture global genetic diversity based on Hapmap (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hapmap.org">http://hapmap.org</ext-link>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000383-The1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref> data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000383.s008">Table S6</xref>). In the United Kingdom (UK), we found strong linkage disequilibrium (LD) and a simple haplotype structure across the entire gene (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000383-t003">Table 3</xref>). Three haplotypes were &#x0003e;1&#x00025; frequency, the most common two haplotypes (1 and 2) differed at all SNPs, a third haplotype (3) was distinguished from the most common haplotype (1) by a single SNP upstream of <italic>HECTD2</italic>. Increased risk of vCJD was associated with haplotype 2, possessing <italic>rs12249854</italic>A, but the extensive LD prevented us from identifying the functional SNP. In PNG, however, we found considerably more diversity with four common haplotypes, 1, 2 and two novel haplotypes 4 and 5 (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">methods</xref> for haplotype inference). Haplotype 2, most significantly associated with vCJD (haplotype association test, <italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.006), showed no significance between kuru and the elderly female survivors of mortuary feasts. Rather, in PNG we found that a population specific haplotype (designated 4) was strongly associated with kuru (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.0009). Haplotype 4 differs from haplotype 2 at a single SNP, <italic>rs12247672</italic>, which itself is significant in vCJD (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.0039) but not at all in kuru (P&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.6138). Our data suggest that there is evidence for HECTD2 association in both vCJD and kuru however the functional polymorphisms are likely to be different. This is not necessarily surprising given the distinct evolutionary history and consequent genetic differences that exist between the UK and PNG populations.

In mouse, we cannot exclude the possibility of other nearby genes or intergenic regions also being implicated as our sequencing studies were not exhaustive. However, in human, the LD block, based on HapMap <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000383-The1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref> data, includes only <italic>HECTD2</italic> and does not extend into the neighbouring genes suggesting that the association observed stems from <italic>HECTD2</italic> and not any other gene in the area.</p><p>In mouse, the promoter, 3&#x02032;UTR polymorphisms and the associated differential expression suggest a mechanism by which <italic>Hectd2</italic> may influence the incubation time phenotype. Similarly, in the UK population a promoter polymorphism is also associated with a susceptibility phenotype and a resulting increase in expression level. This suggests that the mode of HECTD2 action in prion disease may be independent of host and prion strain. Due to lack of available material it has not been possible to replicate these experiments in our kuru samples, however, our haplotype study suggest that a different polymorphism is likely to be functional in the PNG population. This does not rule out the possibility that differential expression is also important in PNG, through an alternative polymorphism, although this may be difficult to determine. Our expression analysis in terminally sick mice suggest that HECTD2 is upregulated during the course of infection therefore we can speculate that a higher base line of expression reduces the time taken to reach a threshold level thereby reducing the incubation time.</p><p>The ubiquitin-proteosome system has been implicated in the pathogenesis of several neurodegenerative diseases which show an accumulation of an abnormally folded protein including prion disease, Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000383-Ciechanover1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000383-Hegde1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>.

Human &#x003b2;-actin or PGK-1 (Applied Biosystems) (data not shown) was duplexed within the reaction as an endogenous control according to the manufacturer's instructions. Four replicates were carried out for all samples using the following cycling conditions: 95&#x000b0;C 5 mins; 95&#x000b0;C 15 s, 60&#x000b0;C 60 s for 45 cycles.</p><p>For both mouse and human samples, standard curves were constructed for both target and endogenous controls and used to calculate the quantities of both transcripts. <italic>Hectd2</italic> values were normalized by dividing with the quantity of endogenous control.</p></sec><sec id="s4c3"><title>SNP genotyping</title><p>Primers and probes for mouse genotyping (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000383.s007">Table S5</xref>) were designed using criteria defined by Applied Biosystems and PrimerExpress software (Applied Biosystems). MGB probes labelled with either Vic or Fam were purchased from Applied Biosystems and primers for amplification were obtained from Sigma-Genosys. For human SNPs pre-designed allelic discrimination assays were purchased from Applied Biosystems and used according to the manufacturer's instructions. 2.5pmole of each primer and 1pmole of each probe was used for mouse genotyping. All reactions were carried out in 5 &#x000b5;l on a 7500 Fast Real-time PCR System (Applied Biosystems) using either RoxMegaMix Gold (Microzone Ltd) or QuantiTect probe PCR kit (Qiagen). Cycling conditions were the same for both enzymes (95&#x000b0;C 15 s, 60&#x000b0;C 60 s for 40 cycles) however RoxMegaMix Gold and QuantiTect enzyme required 5 and 15 mins initial heating at 95&#x000b0;C respectively.
