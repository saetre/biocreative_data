In budding yeast and mice, Exo1 creates single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) at uncapped telomeres. This ssDNA accumulation activates the checkpoint response resulting in cell cycle arrest. Here, we demonstrate that Exo1 is phosphorylated when telomeres are uncapped in <italic>cdc13-1</italic> and <italic>yku70</italic>&#x00394; yeast cells, and in response to the induction of DNA damage. After telomere uncapping, Exo1 phosphorylation depends on components of the checkpoint machinery such as Rad24, Rad17, Rad9, Rad53 and Mec1, but is largely independent of Chk1, Tel1 and Dun1. Serines S372, S567, S587 and S692 of Exo1 were identified as targets for phosphorylation. Furthermore, mutation of these Exo1 residues altered the DNA damage response to uncapped telomeres and camptothecin treatment, in a manner that suggests Exo1 phosphorylation inhibits its activity. We propose that Rad53-dependent Exo1 phosphorylation is involved in a negative feedback loop to limit ssDNA accumulation and DNA damage checkpoint activation.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd><italic>cdc13-1</italic></kwd><kwd>checkpoint</kwd><kwd>Exo1</kwd><kwd>phosphorylation</kwd><kwd>telomere</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec disp-level="1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The DNA damage response is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism dedicated to cellular defence against genomic insults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Elledge, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">Nyberg <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">Rouse and Jackson, 2002</xref>). In yeast and mammals, different types of damage, for example double-stranded breaks (DSBs) or replication stalling, induce a DNA damage response that triggers cell cycle arrest and expression of genes required for DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Kolodner <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>).</p><p>Primary DNA lesions are often processed by nucleases that generate single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). Thus, ssDNA is a common intermediate in DSB repair, nucleotide excision repair, recombination repair and at collapsed replication forks and is believed to have a key function in the DNA damage response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">Lydall and Weinert, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Lee <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">Pang <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>). For example, upon DSB formation, the MRX complex (the Mre11&#x02013;Rad50&#x02013;Xrs2 complex in yeast, or the Mre11&#x02013;Rad50&#x02013;Nbs1 complex in humans) is thought to collaborate with the exonuclease Exo1 in the generation of 3&#x02032;-ended ssDNA tracts at DSB ends, as a first step to initiate the repair process through homologous recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Ivanov <italic>et al</italic>, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">Lee <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">Tsubouchi and Ogawa, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">Lewis <italic>et al</italic>, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Llorente and Symington, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">Schaetzlein <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). ssDNA is coated with replication protein A (RPA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b64">Wang and Haber, 2004</xref>). RPA-covered DNA recruits the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-like protein kinase (PIKK) Mec1 (ATR in human cells) to a region near the DSB end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b68">Zou and Elledge, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Dubrana <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). A second set of proteins is required with Mec1 to initiate the DNA damage checkpoint and consists of a clamp (the Rad17&#x02013;Mec3&#x02013;Ddc1 complex) and a clamp loader (Rad24&#x02013;RFC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">Majka <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). Mec1, in collaboration with the clamp and the clamp loader, activates the downstream kinases Rad53 and Chk1 with the assistance of the checkpoint mediator Rad9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">Sanchez <italic>et al</italic>, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">Sun <italic>et al</italic>, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">Sweeney <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>). Activated Rad53 becomes hyperphosphorylated and is critical for halting cell cycle progression and for DNA repair in part through phosphorylation of downstream target kinase Dun1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Lee <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">Chen <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>).</p><p>Chromosome ends have to be distinguished from DSBs that are potent activators of DNA damage checkpoint. For this purpose, the telomere exerts an effect as a protective cap at the ends of linear eukaryotic chromosomes. Telomeres ensure genomic stability by protecting against end degradation, recombination and fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Blackburn, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">de Lange, 2005</xref>). In budding yeast, telomeric DNA is primarily made of a double-stranded DNA region of tandem TG<sub>1&#x02013;3</sub> repeats, known as the G strand, which extends beyond the duplex region, creating a short single-stranded 3&#x02032; overhang (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Blackburn <italic>et al</italic>, 1989</xref>). This 3&#x02032; overhang is bound by a specific ssDNA-binding protein, Cdc13 (homologue of mammalian Pot1), which protects telomeric ends and is also involved in recruiting telomerase complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">Nugent <italic>et al</italic>, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Hockemeyer <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>).</p><p>Dysfunctional telomeres (i.e. shortened or uncapped) are at the interface between ageing and cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Djojosubroto <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>). Dysfunctional telomeres trigger a DNA damage response resulting in senescence or apoptosis in mammalian cells and are thought to exert an effect in this way as a tumour suppressor mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Campisi <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">Cosme-Blanco <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). In budding yeast, shortened telomeres also activate a DNA damage response, similar to the one triggered by DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Ijpma and Greider, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Enomoto <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>). Telomere uncapping induced in Cdc13-defective cells (<italic>cdc13-1</italic> mutants) leads to long tracts of single-stranded 3&#x02032; DNA at and near telomere ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Garvik <italic>et al</italic>, 1995</xref>). The nuclease, Exo1, is involved in the generation of ssDNA and contributes to the activation of the DNA damage checkpoint in <italic>cdc13-1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Maringele and Lydall, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b69">Zubko <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>). In addition, Exo1 has functions at other kinds of budding yeast telomere capping defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Maringele and Lydall, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Bertuch and Lundblad, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b60">Tsolou and Lydall, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b62">Vega <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>).</p><p>The parallel between budding yeast and mammalian cell responses to uncapped telomeres is strong, and was recently strengthened when a role for Exo1 at uncapped telomeres in mice was demonstrated. Exo1 was shown to participate in the formation of ssDNA, RPA recruitment and ATR activation in response to telomere dysfunction in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">Schaetzlein <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). Furthermore, in this mouse model system, mice lacking Exo1 lived significantly longer than control mice expressing Exo1. This strongly suggests that regulation of Exo1 activity has the potential to affect mammalian cell responses to uncapped telomeres and mammalian lifespan.</p><p>How Exo1 activity is regulated is largely unknown. Two recent papers reported that human Exo1 was phosphorylated by ATR and degraded after treatment of cells by the S-phase inhibitor hydroxyurea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">El-Shemerly <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">2008</xref>). In addition, our previous work in budding yeast suggested the importance of part of the checkpoint kinase cascade, namely Mec1, Rad9 and Rad53, in inhibiting Exo1 at uncapped telomeres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Jia <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b69">Zubko <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>).</p><p>Here, we examine Exo1 post-translational modification triggered by telomere uncapping and DNA damage in budding yeast. We show that Exo1 is phosphorylated in a checkpoint-dependent manner when telomeres are unprotected. Phosphorylation is dependent on components of the clamp (Rad17), the clamp loader (Rad24), the mediator Rad9 and the downstream kinase Rad53 and is largely dependent on Mec1. We also show that Exo1 is phosphorylated by induction of DNA damage. Mutation of the residues in Exo1 that are phosphorylated suggests that Exo1 is inhibited by phosphorylation <italic>in vivo</italic> and that this phosphorylation has an important function in modulating the cellular response to DNA damage and uncapped telomeres.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Exo1 is phosphorylated when telomeres are uncapped</title><p>Post-translational modifications (acetylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitination, glycosylation and so on) have a crucial function in a myriad of cellular processes by affecting the conformation, activity or stability of modified proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">Mann and Jensen, 2003</xref>). In particular, the DNA damage response involves a protein phosphorylation cascade propagated through protein kinases, most importantly Mec1, Rad53 and Chk1 in budding yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">Longhese <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>).</p><p>To determine whether the nuclease Exo1 is modified when telomeres are uncapped, we examined the electrophoretic mobility of Exo1 by western blot. For this purpose, a C-terminal Myc epitope was inserted at the <italic>EXO1</italic> chromosomal locus in a <italic>cdc13-1</italic> strain and the functionality of this modified allele was addressed by spot tests (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2A</xref>). At the restrictive temperatures of 26 and 27&#x000b0;C, the growth of <italic>cdc13-1 EXO1-myc&#x02237;HIS3</italic> strains was most similar to that of <italic>cdc13-1 EXO1</italic> strains but clearly much less than <italic>cdc13-1 exo1</italic>&#x00394; strains. This demonstrates that Exo1-Myc is functional in the context of telomere capping defects.</p><p>Telomere uncapping was induced in a <italic>cdc13-1 EXO1-myc&#x02237;HIS3</italic> strain by growth at 36&#x000b0;C and the mobility of Exo1 was measured by western blot. At different times, samples were collected and subjected to immunoblotting. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2B</xref>, optimized conditions allowed us to detect a subtle but reproducible slower migrating form of Exo1 after 2, 4 and 6 h at 36&#x000b0;C. Rad53, the budding yeast Chk2 kinase, which is phosphorylated and activated as part of the budding yeast DNA damage response, was phosphorylated in this assay with similar kinetics. As a control, we confirmed that this modified form of Exo1 was not due to heat shock as it was not observed after culture of a <italic>CDC13</italic> strain expressing Exo1-Myc at 36&#x000b0;C for 6 h (data not shown). We conclude that Exo1 is modified after telomere uncapping and this modification is associated with a mobility shift detectable by western blot.</p><p>To determine whether the modified form of Exo1 observed after telomere uncapping is due to phosphorylation, we next evaluated the sensitivity of Exo1 shift to lambda phosphatase. For this experiment, we used a <italic>cdc13-1</italic> yeast strain deleted for the protease <italic>PEP4</italic> to avoid degradation of Exo1, observed <italic>in vitro</italic> when proteins were extracted in non-denaturating conditions after culture at 36&#x000b0;C for more than 3 h (data not shown). Native protein extracts from a <italic>cdc13-1 pep4</italic>&#x00394; <italic>EXO1-myc&#x02237;HIS3</italic> strain incubated at 23 or 36&#x000b0;C were treated with lambda phosphatase. We found that phosphatase treatment returned the modified form of Exo1 to its faster migrating original form, indicating that Exo1 is indeed phosphorylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2C</xref>). The phosphatase treatment also reduced the mobility shift of Rad53. These findings indicate that Exo1 is phosphorylated when telomere uncapping is induced in a Cdc13-defective strain.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Exo1 phosphorylation is dependent on components of the checkpoint machinery</title><p>Cells respond to DNA damage and uncapped telomeres by the activation of checkpoint kinase cascades. Therefore, we decided to investigate the dependency of Exo1 phosphorylation on checkpoint genes. For this purpose, <italic>cdc13-1</italic> yeast strains expressing Exo1-Myc and deleted for <italic>RAD24</italic>, <italic>RAD17</italic>, <italic>RAD9</italic>, <italic>RAD53</italic>, <italic>MEC1</italic>, <italic>TEL1</italic>, <italic>DUN1</italic> or <italic>CHK1</italic> were created. The lack of viability of <italic>mec1</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>rad53</italic>&#x00394; cells was rescued by deleting the <italic>SML1</italic> gene, which causes an increase in dNTP synthetic capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b66">Zhao <italic>et al</italic>, 1998</xref>). For each genetic background, Exo1 phosphorylation was assessed, in duplicate strains, by western blot. In parallel, we examined Rad53 phosphorylation in the same extracts. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3A</xref>, <italic>RAD9</italic>, <italic>RAD17</italic>, <italic>RAD24</italic> and <italic>RAD53</italic> were all required for Exo1 phosphorylation upon telomere uncapping. Thus, Exo1 phosphorylation is dependent on components of the clamp loader (Rad24), the clamp (Rad17), the mediator Rad9 and the effector kinase Rad53. In addition, deletion of <italic>MEC1</italic> largely reduces Exo1 phosphorylation, and <italic>mec1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>tel1</italic>&#x00394; double mutants show no phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3B</xref>). Finally, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3C</xref> shows that deletions of <italic>TEL1</italic>, <italic>CHK1</italic> or <italic>DUN1</italic> do not strongly affect Exo1 phosphorylation after telomere uncapping.</p><p>Interestingly, there is a strong correlation between Rad53 and Exo1 phosphorylation in all experiments (i.e. significant Exo1 phosphorylation is detected when Rad53 is phosphorylated at high levels and vice versa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figures 3A and C</xref>)). This correlation suggests that the kinase responsible for Exo1 phosphorylation is either Rad53 or a kinase downstream of Rad53 (other than Dun1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3C</xref>). To test this hypothesis, we examined Exo1 phosphorylation in a cell that contained the <italic>rad53K227A</italic> (kinase dead) allele and <italic>cdc13-1</italic> mutant at restrictive temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3D</xref>). We observed that Exo1 was not phosphorylated in a strain containing the <italic>rad53K227A</italic> allele, suggesting that Rad53, or a kinase downstream of Rad53, is responsible for phosphorylating Exo1 after telomere uncapping. However, we were not able to detect a direct interaction with Exo1 and Rad53 or Rad53KD by immunoprecipitation (data not shown).</p><p>In summary, Exo1 is phosphorylated in response to telomere uncapping and this phosphorylation relies on the DNA damage checkpoint proteins Rad24, Rad17, Rad9, Rad53 and Mec1.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Exo1 phosphorylation is activated by a variety of genomic insults</title><p>To determine whether Exo1 phosphorylation was specific to deprotection of the 3&#x02032; overhang in the <italic>cdc13-1</italic> system, other kinds of genomic stresses were induced in <italic>CDC13</italic> cells. First, telomeres were uncapped in a mutant deleted for <italic>YKU70</italic>. The conserved Ku70/Ku80 heterodimer is involved in telomere end protection, and involved in the non-homologous end joining DNA repair process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Boulton and Jackson, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Jeggo, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Hsu <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Fisher and Zakian, 2005</xref>). At high temperatures, yeast strains defective in Ku uncap their telomeres, induce Exo1-dependent ssDNA formation, and activate cell cycle arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Maringele and Lydall, 2002</xref>). Importantly, Exo1 phosphorylation is detected when <italic>yku70</italic>&#x00394; mutant cells expressing Exo1-Myc are grown at 37&#x000b0;C for 6 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4A</xref>). We conclude that Exo1 is phosphorylated in response to different types of telomere capping defects in budding yeast.</p><p>Exo1 is involved in mismatch repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Fiorentini <italic>et al</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">Tran <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>), DSB repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b61">Tsubouchi and Ogawa, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">Llorente and Symington, 2004</xref>) and at stalled replication forks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Cotta-Ramusino <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Bermejo <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>). Therefore, we tested whether Exo1 was phosphorylated after genomic insults other than telomere uncapping. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4B</xref> indicates that Exo1 phosphorylation is observed after treatment with the DSB-inducing agent bleomycin. To study defects in DNA replication, we examined yeast cells defective in DNA ligase Cdc9 (<italic>cdc9-1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Johnston and Nasmyth, 1978</xref>). When grown at the restrictive temperature of 36&#x000b0;C, DNA replication is defective in <italic>cdc9-1</italic> mutants and Exo1 phosphorylation is detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4">Figure 4B</xref>). Importantly, Exo1 phosphorylation was not detected when cells were treated with nocodazole or alpha factor, showing that cell cycle arrest in G2/M or G1 does not induce Exo1 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 1</xref>). Taken together, our data clearly show that Exo1 phosphorylation is a common response to DNA damage caused by a variety of genomic insults.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Exo1 is phosphorylated on specific sites in response to uncapped telomeres</title><p>To understand why and how Exo1 is phosphorylated in response to telomere uncapping, it was important to determine the identity of the phosphorylated sites. For this purpose, Exo1 was purified using a TAP epitope fused in frame at the C terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">Rigaut <italic>et al</italic>, 1999</xref>). A <italic>cdc13-1 EXO1-tap&#x02237;URA3</italic> strain was created and the functionality of Exo1-Tap was assessed by spot tests. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5A</xref>, <italic>cdc13-1 EXO1-tap&#x02237;URA3</italic> and <italic>cdc13-1 EXO1</italic> strains grew similarly showing that Exo1-Tap is functional. To avoid degradation of Exo1 when incubating cells for more than 3 h at 36&#x000b0;C, we also used a strain deleted for <italic>PEP4</italic>, coding for the vacuolar protease Pep4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5A</xref>). <italic>cdc13-1 EXO1-tap&#x02237;URA3</italic> strains were grown at 23&#x000b0;C or at 36&#x000b0;C for 3 h and a &#x02018;quick' TAP purification was performed to preserve as many post-translational modifications as possible (Materials and methods). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5B</xref> lane 1 shows TAP purification from cells grown at 23&#x000b0;C, lane 3 shows samples grown at 36&#x000b0;C and lane 5 is a control purification from a non-epitope-tagged strain. Lanes 1 and 3 show a single extra band, marked with a star, not detected in the control lane (lane 5). This band was identified as Exo1-Tap by western blot (data not shown). Purification of Exo1 did not reveal any other extra band(s), suggesting that we were not able to identify any protein partners of Exo1 either in exponentially dividing cells or in cells arrested at the checkpoint due to telomere uncapping.</p><p>The Exo1-Tap bands from lanes 1 and 3 and from a <italic>cdc13-1 EXO1-tap&#x02237;URA3 pep4</italic>&#x00394; strain grown for 4 h at 36&#x000b0;C (not shown) were excised and digested with trypsin. The digests were analysed by LC-MS with precursor 79 scanning as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b65">Williamson <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). The tryptic digests were also analysed on an LTQ-orbitrap mass spectrometer coupled to a Dionex 3000 nano LC system (Materials and methods). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f5">Figure 5C</xref>, a dramatic increase is seen in the peak intensities for phosphorylated Exo1, purified when telomere uncapping was induced (grey line, compared with red line, 23&#x000b0;C control).

The <italic>EXO1-tap</italic> construct and 900 bp upstream was amplified from yeast by PCR and subcloned in the single-copy vector pRS413 to create pRS413-Exo1-Tap. We checked by western blot that Exo1 expression level by the pRS413-Exo1-Tap in <italic>cdc13-1 exo1</italic>&#x00394; was similar to the expression level generated by the integrated <italic>EXO1-tap</italic> allele (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figure 2</xref>). The four serine residues S372, S567, S587 and S692 were converted into alanine (Exo1-4S&#x02237;A-Tap) or glutamic acid (Exo1-4S&#x02237;E-Tap). Conversion of serine to alanine blocks the phosphorylation on these residues, whereas the negative charge of the glutamic acid mimics the negative charge carried by a phosphorylated serine residue.</p><p>The growth of <italic>cdc13-1 exo1</italic>&#x00394; strains expressing WT Exo1-Tap, Exo1-4S&#x02237;A-Tap or Exo1-4S&#x02237;E-Tap on centromeric plasmids was analysed, in duplicate, by spot tests at a range of temperatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6A</xref>). <italic>cdc13-1 exo1</italic>&#x00394; strains expressing Exo1-Tap or mutants grew less well than <italic>cdc13-1 exo1</italic>&#x00394; carrying the empty vector pRS413 at 28&#x000b0;C (data not shown). We conclude that Exo1-Tap, Exo1-4S&#x02237;A-Tap and Exo1-4S&#x02237;E-Tap are all functional. However, at 27&#x000b0;C and particularly noticeable at 26.5&#x000b0;C, we detected differences in growth between cells expressing Exo1-Tap, Exo1-4S&#x02237;A-Tap or Exo1-4S&#x02237;E-Tap. At 26.5&#x000b0;C, <italic>cdc13-1</italic> strains expressing Exo1-4S&#x02237;A-Tap grow poorly compared with <italic>cdc13-1</italic> expressing Exo1-Tap and Exo1-4S&#x02237;E-Tap. We can conclude from this, and our observation that overexpression of Exo1 is detrimental to the growth of the <italic>cdc13-1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figures 3 and 4</xref>), that Exo1-4S&#x02237;A is more active than either Exo1 or Exo1-4S&#x02237;E. In addition, we also found that <italic>cdc13-1</italic> strain expressing Exo1-4S&#x02237;E-Tap grew better than <italic>cdc13-1</italic> expressing Exo1-4S&#x02237;A-Tap or Exo1-Tap at 26 and 26.5&#x000b0;C. The effects of Exo1 mutations are subtle but reproducible and are consistent with the idea that Exo1 phosphorylation reduces the ability of Exo1 to respond to uncapped telomeres.</p><p>To better test the effects of serine to alanine or serine to glutamic acid mutations in Exo1, we integrated the alleles into the normal <italic>EXO1</italic> chromosomal locus. First, we showed that strains carrying a truncated Exo1 (<italic>exo1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>1091&#x02013;2109</italic>), which was used to generate the mutated <italic>EXO1</italic> strains, showed a loss of function similar to <italic>exo1</italic>&#x00394; strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6B</xref>). We found that Exo1-4S&#x02237;E was less functional than Exo1 when expressed from the normal locus because <italic>cdc13-1 exo1-4S&#x02237;E</italic> mutants formed larger colonies than <italic>cdc13-1 EXO1</italic> strains at 26 and 26.5&#x000b0;C. However, we were unable to observe an effect of the <italic>exo1-4S&#x02237;A</italic> mutations, at the <italic>EXO1</italic> locus, in <italic>cdc13-1</italic> mutants.</p><p>To test whether the phosphorylation of Exo1 affected responses to other types of DNA damage, we treated cells with the topoisomerase I poison camptothecin. This drug is believed to exert its toxicity through the generation of replication-associated DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">Pommier <italic>et al</italic>, 2003</xref>). Under this condition, DNA end resection by Exo1 and the ensuing repair is expected to be beneficial to cell growth and survival. This view is supported by the findings that strains carrying <italic>EXO1</italic> truncation or deletion show sensitivity to camptothecin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6C</xref> and data not shown). After camptothecin treatment, we found that cells expressing Exo1-4S&#x02237;A from the chromosomal locus were slightly more resistant to treatment compared with <italic>EXO1</italic> strains, whereas the strains expressing Exo1-4S&#x02237;E were more sensitive than <italic>EXO1</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6C</xref>). Although subtle, these results obtained from plasmid and integrated alleles strongly suggest that Exo1 phosphorylation inhibits the activity of Exo1 in response to telomere uncapping and camptothecin treatment.</p><p>One explanation for the comparatively subtle effects of the Exo1-4S&#x02237;A and Exo1-4S&#x02237;E mutations might be that other serine (threonine or tyrosine) residues were phosphorylated when the primary kinase targets had been mutated. Consistent with this idea, there are 61 serines, 36 threonines and 21 tyrosines in Exo1. To test this hypothesis, we epitope-tagged <italic>exo1-4S&#x02237;A</italic> and <italic>exo1-4S&#x02237;E</italic> alleles at the <italic>EXO1</italic> locus with the Myc epitope. In response to telomere uncapping, there was a clear increase in mobility of both Exo1-4S&#x02237;A-Myc and Exo1-4S&#x02237;E-Myc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6D</xref>). We conclude that in the absence of the primary phosphorylation targets Exo1 is modified at additional positions. Taken together, all our data suggest that Exo1 phosphorylation is regulated by and regulates the DNA damage response upon telomere uncapping and after treatment with camptothecin.</p></sec></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Discussion</title><p>The DNA damage response is a powerful intracellular network that has the potential to repair damage, induce cell cycle arrest and in some cell types, induce apoptosis or senescence. To ensure that the DNA damage response works to the benefit of its host cell and organism, it is essential that responses to DNA damage are appropriately measured and properly regulated. Here, we show that Exo1, an evolutionarily conserved double strand-specific 5&#x02032; to 3&#x02032; exonuclease, involved in mismatch repair, DSB repair, meiosis and in responding to stalled replication forks and uncapped telomeres, is targeted and phosphorylated by the DNA damage checkpoint pathway.</p><p>Previous experiments have shown that Exo1 is critical for generating ssDNA at three classes of uncapped telomeres in budding yeast (<italic>cdc13-1</italic>, <italic>yku70</italic>&#x00394; and telomerase knockout, <italic>tlc1</italic>&#x00394;, cells; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">Maringele and Lydall, 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Bertuch and Lundblad, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b69">Zubko <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>). Exo1-dependent ssDNA appears to be a stimulus for the DNA damage checkpoint that results in cell cycle arrest in all three cases. In a similar way in mice, Exo1-dependent ssDNA formation amplifies the DNA damage signal at dysfunctional telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">Schaetzlein <italic>et al</italic>, 2007</xref>).</p><p>Here, we show that a subset of DNA damage checkpoint proteins, Mec1, Rad17, Rad24, Rad9 and Rad53, has a crucial function in Exo1 phosphorylation and consequently modulates the accumulation of ssDNA at uncapped telomeres (this paper and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Jia <italic>et al</italic>, 2004</xref>). Other checkpoint proteins, Dun1, Chk1 and Tel1 do not have an important function in this process.</p><p>We found that Exo1 was strongly phosphorylated on residues S372, S567, S587 and S692 in the C terminus. The phenotype of mutating these residues to alanines, to prevent phosphorylation, or glutamic acids, to mimic phosphorylation, was subtle but indicated that Exo1 phosphorylation inhibits Exo1 <italic>in vivo</italic>. We propose that Exo1 phosphorylation limits the accumulation of ssDNA at unprotected telomeres, and therefore participates in a negative feedback loop to limit DNA damage checkpoint activation. Consistent with this conclusion, we find that expression of Exo1-4S&#x02237;A and overexpression of Exo1 hyperactivates the DNA damage response in cells with uncapped telomeres (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Figures 3&#x02013;5</xref>).</p><p>As Exo1 is a protein involved in many different DNA repair pathways, we suggest that Exo1 modification may exert an effect to downregulate Exo1 activity after many different kinds of damage. Such a modification would also exert an effect to limit the accumulation of ssDNA at damaged DNA. Consistent with this hypothesis, we observed Exo1 phosphorylation after treatment with the DSB-inducing agent, bleomycin and after inactivation of DNA ligase I. We also show that altering Exo1 phosphorylation affects sensitivity to camptothecin, in a manner that again suggests inhibitory role of phosphorylation on Exo1 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f6">Figure 6C</xref>).</p><p>There are several possible mechanisms by which charge effects caused by phosphorylation of Exo1 might inhibit its activity. The most direct would be if phosphorylation of Exo1 inhibited the 5&#x02032; to 3&#x02032; exonuclease activity exhibited by Exo1. Phosphorylation of the C terminus might induce conformational changes that affect the recruitment of Exo1 to DNA and/or inhibit Exo1 activity. Another mechanism would be if the phosphorylation of Exo1 affects the ability of Exo1 to move through chromatin. As DNA damage induces chromatin modifications near DNA lesions, it seems conceivable, and indeed perhaps desirable, that chromatin structure near DNA damage prevents access of phosphorylated Exo1. Such an interaction would exert an effect to limit the accumulation of ssDNA near uncapped telomeres, DSBs or other types of lesions. Another possibility is that phosphorylation of Exo1 affects interaction of Exo1 with other proteins, for example, a nuclease activator or inhibitor. It has been reported previously that interactions between Exo1 and the mismatch repair proteins Mlh1 and Msh2 involve the Exo1 C terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">Tishkoff <italic>et al</italic>, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">Schmutte <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">Tran <italic>et al</italic>, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">2002</xref>). As the four phosphorylated serine residues have been identified at Exo1 C terminus, we can envisage that phosphorylation may affect the interactions between Exo1 and Mlh1 or Msh2. Finally, two recent studies in mammalian cells reported that Exo1 is ubiquitinated, and degraded, after DNA is damaged in the presence of hydroxyurea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">El-Shemerly <italic>et al</italic>, 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">2008</xref>). In many cases, phosphorylation is an important signal for proteins to be recognized as targets by the proteasome&#x02013;ubiquitin pathway. It seemed plausible that ubiquitination and degradation may indeed occur for budding yeast Exo1 and contribute to its inhibition. However, we saw no degradation of Exo1 when proteins were extracted in denaturating conditions (TCA) after telomere uncapping. The degradation we observed <italic>in vitro</italic> when proteins were extracted in native conditions after 4 h at 36&#x000b0;C was dependent on the vacuolar protease <italic>PEP4</italic>.</p><p>In conclusion, regulation of Exo1 upon telomere uncapping involves checkpoint-dependent phosphorylation, leading to the inhibition of Exo1. We believe that Rad53 (homologue of Chk2 in human cells) has a key function in this process and is most likely the kinase responsible for Exo1 phosphorylation. Examples are beginning to be identified where targets of the DNA damage response regulate DNA damage processing. For example, the mammalian homologous recombination protein, BRCA1, is phosphorylated by Chk2 and this seems to affect whether homologous recombination or non-homologous end joining pathways are used to repair DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b63">Wang <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b67">Zhuang <italic>et al</italic>, 2006</xref>). If our experiments in yeast can be extrapolated to mammalian cells, we suggest that Chk2 inhibitors may affect the generation of ssDNA as well as downstream aspects of cell cycle arrest pathways in cells with telomere capping defects. Therefore, Chk2 inhibitors may also, similar to Exo1 deletion does in mice and yeast cells, improve the vitality of cells and animals with telomere capping defects, and perhaps, have a positive effect on mammalian ageing.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Yeast strains</title><p>All the strains used in this study are in the W303 genetic background and are <italic>RAD5</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup>, unless otherwise stated in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">Supplementary Table 1</xref>.
