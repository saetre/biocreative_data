Region B was in the anterior of the oocyte chamber just beyond the ring canal. Region C was the posterior extremity of the oocyte centered upon the tip of the oocyte where <italic>osk</italic> and Staufen protein both colocalized (arrowheads in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006241-g002">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006241.s008">Movie S3</xref>). For each of these regions, we determined a colocalization index (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006241-g002">Figure 2D</xref>) as a function of time. In region A, we observed the colocalization index to fluctuate greatly, with fleeting collisions of <italic>osk</italic> and Staufen-GFP trafficking through the ring canal marking the peaks of the colocalization. This suggested that though <italic>osk</italic> and Staufen protein engage in frequent collisions prior to and just after traversing the ring canal, these interactions do not result in their stable association. Region B displayed the lowest amount of colocalization. Thus, as <italic>osk</italic> passed from the nurse cell into the anterior portion of the oocyte, colocalization with Staufen did not increase strongly suggesting that association with Staufen does not occur in this region. Further, it disfavors a model where <italic>osk</italic> is &#x02018;fetched&#x02019; from the anterior and transported to the posterior of the oocyte due to an interaction with Staufen, as has been posited by some <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006241-Schuldt1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006241-Palacios3">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>.

Our previous observation implied that <italic>osk</italic> should be able to proceed to at least the center of the oocyte and perhaps beyond before requiring association with Staufen protein. To address this question we imaged, with high resolution, the dynamics of native <italic>osk</italic> in stage 7&#x02013;10 Staufen mutant oocytes. We specifically were interested in observing the specific point at which <italic>osk</italic> transport is arrested and fails to accumulate at the posterior of the oocyte.

Since Hrp48 is a member of the hnRNP A/B family of RNA binding proteins, and binds to the same three BREs in the <italic>osk</italic> 3&#x02032;- UTR, as well as to a translational activation element near the 5&#x02032; end of the mRNA, we examined its role in the <italic>in vivo</italic> oligomerization of <italic>osk</italic>.</p><p>We sought to shed light on the role Hrp48 could play in the reshaping/oligomerization process and whether the formation of oligomers was an essential precursor to localization. To this end, we imaged Hrp48 mutant egg chambers in a Staufen-GFP background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006241-g005">Figure 5</xref>). We observed a weak and highly diffuse pattern of <italic>osk</italic> in the nurse cell and oocyte cytoplasm, with no accumulation whatsoever of <italic>osk</italic> at the posterior pole (data not shown). Interestingly, in the nurse cell nuclei, we saw the accumulation of <italic>osk</italic> particles that appeared to be relatively immobile (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006241.s014">Movie S9</xref>) as compared to wild-type (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006241.s006">Movie S1</xref>). Further we observed that the small amounts of <italic>osk</italic> that were exported to the cytoplasm were unable to form particles in the cytoplasm that could then be transported to the posterior as had been observed in the wild-type background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006241-g005">Figure 5</xref>). The lack of <italic>osk</italic> particles suggested that <italic>osk</italic> required Hrp48 for its assembly into a large mRNP particle of oligomers and for its subsequent association with Staufen. Further, it strongly implicated the oligomerization step as a key step in its efficient transport and localization. It also supposes that binding to the BRE region of <italic>osk</italic> by Bruno or functional Hrp48 is essential for the aggregates of <italic>osk</italic> to form. Because a similar phenotype was observed in Hrp48 mutants where Staufen particles are formed (data not shown), we ruled out a direct relationship between <italic>osk</italic> particle formation and Staufen particle formation in Hrp48 mutants. Hrp48 is one of the three most abundant hnRNPs in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and is thought to bind most, if not all, transcripts in the nucleus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006241-Kelley1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006241-Matunis1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006241-Matunis2">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006241-Matunis3">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore its effect on Staufen particle formation may be pleiotropic, and due to an effect Hrp48 has on the metabolism of other mRNA transcripts.</p><fig id="pone-0006241-g005" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0006241.g005</object-id><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Nuclear protein Hrp48 acts to aggregate <italic>oskar</italic> mRNPs.</title><p>(A) <italic>oskar</italic> mRNP nuclear dynamics in Hrp48 mutant oocytes, where distinct particles are only observed in the nucleus (arrowheads) and not in the cytoplasm of a nurse cell.

Due to the natural motion of the nurse cell nucleus during oogenesis, we used a separate algorithm that calculates the motion of nucleus in space, and subtracts this from the motion of detected particles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006241-Cabal1">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref>. Using this method, we were able to quantify the precise degree of motion of <italic>osk</italic> and determine its degree of confinement to a specific region of the nucleus. We calculated the average MSD of the nuclear <italic>osk</italic> and its coefficient of diffusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006241-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). Our results for <italic>osk</italic> particles were close to those calculated for the <italic>Drosophila</italic> ribosomal DNA locus, a locus confined in its mobility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006241-Vazquez1">&#x0005b;57&#x0005d;</xref>. Ordinarily this would be highly suggestive of an mRNA that essentially behaves like a restricted transcription locus with highly constricted mobility. The oscillating motion of the particle is suggestive of a confinement to a site of transcription and an inability of <italic>osk</italic> to venture further away. Alternatively, the particles indicate where transcription is occurring by an accumulation of mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006241-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). Larger particles do not form in the cytoplasm as we observe in wild-type oocytes. The latter explanation is strengthened by observations of diffuse <italic>osk</italic> signals in the cytoplasm, indicating that <italic>osk</italic> is indeed exported to the cytoplasm, but does not form particles there. Therefore Bruno and Hrp48 are necessary for <italic>osk</italic> oligomerization, with functional Bruno alone being insufficient.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>To date, the subtle changes that occur at distinct steps in the transport of RNA-protein complexes, particularly <italic>osk</italic> and its known <italic>trans</italic>-acting proteins, have been impervious to biochemical analyses. The determination of the posterior pole plasm, germline and abdominal determinants, depends in large part on the Staufen-dependent localization of <italic>oskar</italic> mRNA. <italic>osk</italic>'s transport over the relatively long distance from the nurse cell to the oocyte posterior, necessitates a highly choreographed interaction with <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors acquired within the nucleus and the cytoplasm. By imaging <italic>oskar</italic> mRNA and Staufen <italic>in vivo</italic>, we have been able to provide biophysical evidence for several important events. Firstly, and contrary to all our expectations, <italic>oskar</italic> mRNA is only able to associate with Staufen near the mid-posterior of the oocyte where the two form large particles together and become co-localized to the posterior extremity in a tight crescent. Secondly, this transport occurs in higher order RNP assemblies, or aggregates, for which Hrp48 is necessary, but not sufficient, for their formation. These aggregates undergo extensive reshaping during their transport, acquiring and losing mRNA particles as they travel from the nurse cell to the posterior of the oocyte. Thirdly, as has also been recently shown by Zimyanin et al., the transport of <italic>osk</italic> is rapid, with the motion best described as super diffusive while in the oocyte. Our studies have aided in further refining the model for this transport posited by Zimyanin et al., which they describe as a &#x0201c;biased random walk&#x0201d;. Because we have used a bespoke 3D tracking algorithm that is able to describe local motion in different parts of the oocyte, we are able to provide an unprecedented description of the motion of several subpopulations of <italic>osk</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006241-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). In general these velocities are in concordance with the most predominant findings reported in Zimyanin et al. while taking into account the smaller standard deviations. By investigating the role of microtubules and kinesin, they show that <italic>osk</italic> is not necessarily conjugated to kinesin for its motion in the oocyte. Thus kinesin could influence at least one phase of <italic>osk</italic> transport either directly, by being bound to <italic>osk</italic>, or indirectly by creating cytoplasmic flows. This could also explain the plethora of <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors <italic>osk</italic> interacts with, in order to regulate progression through these various steps.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>Towards a new role for Staufen</title><p>Staufen's implication in the transport of mRNAs extends to several biological systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006241-Roegiers1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>.

Because Staufen has been found to be important in the correct localization of <italic>osk</italic>, and due to their similar localization pattern in the developing oocyte, it has been used as a surrogate to indicate the transcript's location <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006241-Schuldt1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006241-Braat1">&#x0005b;59&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006241-Palacios4">&#x0005b;60&#x0005d;</xref>. In those studies, <italic>osk</italic> transport was assumed to be dependent on Staufen, from its earliest contact until its eventual localization at the posterior of the oocyte. In contrast, we observe Staufen to be in particles distinct from <italic>osk</italic> until only the latest steps in the transport process near the posterior of the oocyte. This strongly suggests that Staufen protein is more likely to be implicated in the later stages of <italic>osk</italic> localization. Our data show that despite frequent and fleeting collisions between <italic>osk</italic> and Staufen at the ring canal, these still do not result in the formation of an observable stable <italic>osk</italic>-Staufen complex. Moreover, though <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization studies have shown <italic>osk</italic> localized to the anterior of the oocyte in Staufen mutants, we and others have observed that in Staufen mutants, <italic>osk</italic> is able to reach the posterior of the oocyte, but does not become highly concentrated there <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006241-Micklem1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006241-vanEeden1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The Macdonald group first posited <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006241-KimHa2">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref> that the role of Staufen may not necessarily be in transport, but rather in translational activation of <italic>osk</italic> at the posterior. Gunkel et al., 1998 and Rongo et al., 1995 found that localization dependent translation of <italic>osk</italic> occurred in a highly spatially restricted manner only at the posterior and required a locally restricted interaction between <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors and <italic>osk</italic>. Indeed as Kim-Ha et al., 1995 demonstrated, of all the so-called &#x02018;posterior group genes,&#x02019; only Staufen was able to activate translation of <italic>osk</italic>. Several <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors have been found that interact with <italic>oskar</italic> mRNA, and they almost universally play a role in translational repression to maintain the <italic>osk</italic> particle translationally silent during its long journey from the nurse cell nucleus to the posterior of the oocyte. Interestingly, a core component of the RISC (<underline>R</underline>NA <underline>i</underline>nduced <underline>s</underline>ilencing <underline>c</underline>omplex), <italic>aubergine</italic>, is required for <italic>osk</italic> translation, and the microRNA mir280 has been computationally predicted to bind <italic>oskar</italic> mRNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006241-Stark1">&#x0005b;61&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006241-Cook1">&#x0005b;62&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006241-deMoor1">&#x0005b;63&#x0005d;</xref>. Since Staufen protein is required for translation and only interacts with <italic>osk</italic> near the posterior, we propose that Staufen is the <italic>trans</italic>-acting factor that is able to stably associate with <italic>osk</italic> and spatially restricts the translation of Oskar protein to the posterior of the oocyte.</p><p>Studies in neurons have also questioned the role Staufen plays in the direct trafficking of mRNPs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006241-Thomas1">&#x0005b;64&#x0005d;</xref>. The binding domain of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Staufen dsRBD3, which is essential for Staufen function and <italic>osk</italic> localization, shares common structural features with the N-terminal domain of bacterial ribosomal RNA-binding protein S5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006241-Bycroft1">&#x0005b;65&#x0005d;</xref>. This suggests that Staufen may not bind chiefly to <italic>osk</italic>, but rather to another component of the mRNP, as it is speculated to do in neurons. Bolstering this observation is the finding that Staufen 1 and 2 in mammals are recruited to the polysomes and not to newly synthesized cytoplasmic mRNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006241-Thomas1">&#x0005b;64&#x0005d;</xref>. Taken together, the observed results suggest that Staufen-containing mRNPs could be linked to mRNA engaged in polysomes, and thus, not directly related to that of mRNA recently exported from the nucleus or in transport to those polysomes. Staufen has been suggested to play a role in actually targeting <italic>osk</italic> to polysomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006241-Braat1">&#x0005b;59&#x0005d;</xref>.

Our findings are reinforced by the recent work of Zimyanin et al. describing the motion of <italic>osk</italic> to be &#x0201c;biased random walk&#x0201d;. Our biophysical data, and especially our highly refined spatial data describing specific velocities in specific regions is the first of its kind for <italic>osk.</italic> It largely concurs with the velocities given by Zimyanin et al., 0.04 &#x000b5;m/s&#x000b1;0.02 versus our largest class of <italic>osk</italic> particles, which is 0.022 &#x000b5;m/s. We find this transport to be super-diffusive or active transport in the oocyte, while in other compartments it occur at lesser speeds. Experiments we conducted in Hrp48 mutant oocytes strongly suggest that the nuclear and cytoplasmic aggregation of <italic>osk</italic> and its assembly into higher order RNPs, is an essential step in its transport during stage 7 to 10. It has been observed that the action of molecular motors, kinesin I and dynein, generate cytoplasmic flows which serve to traffic large particles such as <italic>osk</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006241-Serbus1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006241-Januschke1">&#x0005b;66&#x0005d;</xref>. Further microtubule studies have shown a general motion of <italic>osk</italic> to the plus ends of the microtubule in the oocyte. Once <italic>osk</italic> reaches the posterior pole, it is &#x02018;captured&#x02019; and the anchoring phase is initiated. Oskar protein acts to trap <italic>osk</italic> mRNA at the posterior, spatially controlling its translation, and creates a key feedback loop in the accumulation of <italic>osk</italic>. This may occur due to the prepositioning of ribosomes at the posterior, thus making synthesis of Oskar protein possible only there. This is true in neurons where ribosomes positioned at the post-synaptic, density to facilitate spatiotemporal control of translation of localized mRNAs.</p><p>Long-range transport of mRNA depends on nuclear factors overwhelmingly acting to repress translation during transport and spatial control of translation of these mRNAs. This may be coupled to three different levels of <italic>osk</italic> translational and localization control that have been hypothesized in <italic>Drosophila</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006241-KimHa2">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. All are well in line with our current observations of Staufen-<italic>osk</italic> interactions, and those described by Zimyanin et al. The first would occur prior to, and independent of, posterior localization, and is characterized by the <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors, loaded in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm, which repress <italic>osk</italic> translation. The release from translational repression would be the second level. It would also require posterior localization of <italic>osk</italic> and as Gunkel et al., 1998, determined, a locally restricted interaction with a <italic>trans</italic>-acting factor would occur at the posterior of the oocyte to permit translation. Finally, the third level of translational control would occur as a translational activation event independent of both the initial repression and localization. This latter level of control is suggested by the phenotype of Staufen mutants. Under normal circumstances, posterior localization is a pre-requisite for <italic>osk</italic> translation. However, Staufen mutants still lack <italic>osk</italic> activity when the first level of control is abolished, i.e. translational repression mediated by nuclear factors such as Bruno. This implicates a requirement for Staufen in translation, independent of localization. Prior to our data, it was difficult to reconcile the ability of Staufen to be a key translational activator and be the major protein involved in the transport of <italic>osk</italic>. Some models of transport had suggested Oskar protein is actively degraded as <italic>osk</italic> is transported until it reaches the posterior where the degradation mechanism is silenced <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006241-Braat1">&#x0005b;59&#x0005d;</xref>. Our data, showing a localized interaction between <italic>osk</italic> and Staufen near the posterior, is able to reconcile the role of Staufen with its demonstrated role as a translational activator.</p><p>Staufen-<italic>osk</italic> interactions from our data are only stable at the mid-posterior, which still suggests an as of yet unidentified mechanism by which their stable interaction is spatially restricted to this region. A possible mechanism is the microRNA dependent recruitment of RISC to <italic>osk</italic>. Cook et al., 2004 suggested that mir280 binds to <italic>osk</italic> would recruit the RISC components <italic>armitage (armi)</italic> and <italic>aubergine (aub)</italic>. Like Staufen, these proteins are required for the timely translation of <italic>osk</italic>. Evidence that may link Staufen to RISC comes from the recent finding showing a high degree of conservation between the RBD of Staufen and the <italic>Drosophila</italic> C virus (DCV) protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006241-vanRij1">&#x0005b;67&#x0005d;</xref>. DCV protein is a suppressor of RNAi and sequesters siRNA produced in an antiviral response by <italic>Drosophila</italic> to destroy viral RNA, thus enabling DCV to more successfully infect <italic>Drosophila</italic>. This high degree of conservation in the RBDs suggests Staufen may act through RISC to control <italic>osk</italic> translation. In addition, <italic>armi</italic>, an SDE3 homolog, contains eight motifs characteristic of the Upf1p family of ATP-dependent RNA helicases. In mammals, Staufen 1 recruits Upf1 to specific 3'UTRs where it acts in mRNA decay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006241-Kim1">&#x0005b;68&#x0005d;</xref>. Similarly, Staufen may associate with Armi and promote <italic>oskar</italic> mRNA decay at the posterior pole during later stages of oogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Higher order mRNP assemblies in the transport of mRNA</title><p>We determine that the transport process from the nurse cell nucleus to the oocyte posterior requires <italic>osk</italic> to be in a higher order RNP assembly that, if disrupted, leads to an inability to localize at the posterior or associate with Staufen there.

Our highly specific detection technique for mRNAs enabled for the first time, the continuous real-time, simultaneous covisualization of a native mRNA and a protein.

We observed the formation of large mRNP particles undergoing extensive reshaping prior to and upon exiting the ring canal, all in a Staufen independent manner.</p><p>The formation of such oligomers has been recently proposed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006241-Chekulaeva1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref> as a revised version of the Spirin hypothesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006241-Spirin1">&#x0005b;69&#x0005d;</xref>. Namely, that mRNAs, such as <italic>osk</italic>, are sequestered in large complexes &#x02018;masking&#x02019; them from translation and maintaining their stability. Chekulaeva and coworkers have proposed that Bruno binds to recognition sites in the 5&#x02032;- and 3&#x02032;- UTRs of <italic>osk</italic>, acts to promote the oligomerization of <italic>osk</italic> and represses translation. Our results are the first visual confirmation of <italic>osk</italic> transported in such oligomers of many <italic>osk</italic> transcripts. Through an elegant set of experiments, Spirin proposed that in unfertilized eggs, all stored (maternal) mRNAs exist in a large &#x02018;informosome,&#x02019; defined as the &#x02018;masked&#x02019; form of mRNA, found in equilibrium with inactive oligoribosomes, or mRNAs loaded with ribosomes. We found these &#x02018;informosomes&#x02019; to be absent in Hrp48 mutants, and believe that this would also hold true in Bruno mutant flies. Thus, we show <italic>in vivo</italic> confirmation that high order assemblies of mRNPs, through nuclear factors, play a key role in <italic>osk</italic> transport. Such aggregates may possess hundreds of transcripts (Supporting Information), which remain efficiently &#x02018;masked&#x02019; for transport over long distances. Given that Bruno and Hrp48 are thought to form homodimers that permit such oligomerization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006241-Huynh1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006241-Chekulaeva1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, physical constraints must exist to limit the number of transcripts in such oligomers. The ring canal may thus act as one such limitation causing the disruption of large particles, as we have observed.</p><p>Overall, the oligomerization of mRNPs is essential for <italic>osk</italic> to be transported by cytoplasmic motors and, flows as implicated in studies by Zimyanin et al.

Live microscopy was performed with a Perkin-Elmer UltraView RS Nipkow-disk confocal system controlled with PE-viewer software (version 1.0.0.9) on a Zeiss Axiovert 200 inverted microscope with 40&#x000d7; objective (Zeiss PlanNeofluar, 1.3 NA, oil immersion) acquired by a Hamamatsu Orca II ER cooled CCD camera or an Andor EMCCD camera. Chromatic aberration was verified before image capture by alignment of 15 &#x000b5;m Focal Check Fluorescent Microspheres (Molecular Probes). With this objective, pixel size is 164.83 nm. All analysis was done in 3D with a minimum of 12 Z-stacks and 1 &#x000b5;m Z-step used. Exposure time was 200 ms at excitation wavelength 488 nm and 568 nm/647 nm taken in continuous acquisition mode (i.e. no pause between Z stacks). Acquired images were converted from RAW format to 16-bit TIFF using a custom made ImageJ javascript written by M. Marchand, E.Glory &#x00026; M. Mhlanga. Image analysis on these TIFF files such as 3D detection and tracking of <italic>osk</italic> and Staufen-GFP were performed using QUIA software (Institut Pasteur) as described in the Supplementary Data.

We quantified the fluorescent level emitted by the molecular beacon over a region encompassing the entire length of the oocyte (boxed region in first panel; graph, b).

To visualize clearly the association between osk and Barentsz the red and green channels were de-noised. Cancellations of the background and noise effects make the superposition of the two channels particularly demonstrative of the colocalization at a given time. This process involves first a multi scales B3 wavelet transform which is especially adapted to isotropic signals such as RNA particles, and then a statistical thresholding in each band. Here six tracks of oskar-Barentsz-GFP complexes are shown with their movements in the cytoplasm of the nurse cell. Barentsz is present at the nuclear envelope (most likely the outer envelope) and loads oskar mRNPs as they exit the nucleus (see movie 12). The Barentsz GFP transgenic fly also expresses endogenous (unlabeled) Barentsz protein, therefore particles of oskar mRNP without Barentsz GFP are visible.</p><p>(1.48 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0006241.s004.doc" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0006241.s005"><label>Figure S4</label><caption><p>3D plus time tracking of oskar mRNA. (A) The velocity and MSD of osk were calculated in a wild-type oocyte injected with molecular beacons. The resulting tracks were superimposed on the final timepoint image. Using an advanced version of our standard algorithm QUIA, three regions of the oocyte were selected to analyze the velocity of osk. Osk motion is heterogenous with many molecules engaged in slow motion as well as a small sub-population engaged in rapid motion at a given time. Three regions within the oocyte are arbitrarily selected, and depicted in Green, Red and Yellow boxes. (B) The tracks within each of the Green, Red and Yellow regions were analyzed for their velocity. The number of displacements refers to the number of tracks. The tracking algorithm is able to give important information as to how subpopulations of osk particles behave in differing regions of the oocyte. This is especially important since the movement is not uniform throughout the entire oocyte chamber. Posterior is oriented to the right.
