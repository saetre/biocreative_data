The vast majority of FRDA mutations involve expansion of a GAA&#x02022;TTC-repeat tract in intron 1, which leads to an <italic>FXN</italic> mRNA deficit. Bisulfite mapping demonstrates that the region adjacent to the repeat was methylated in both unaffected and affected individuals. However, methylation was more extensive in patients. Additionally, three residues were almost completely methylation-free in unaffected individuals but almost always methylated in those with FRDA. One of these residues is located within an E-box whose deletion caused a significant drop in promoter activity in reporter assays. Elevated levels of histone H3 dimethylated on lysine 9 were seen in FRDA cells consistent with a more repressive chromatin organization. Such chromatin is known to reduce transcription elongation. This may be one way in which the expanded repeats contribute to the frataxin deficit in FRDA. Our data also suggest that repeat-mediated chromatin changes may also affect transcription initiation by blocking binding of factors that increase frataxin promoter activity. Our results also raise the possibility that the repeat-mediated increases in DNA methylation in the <italic>FXN</italic> gene in FRDA patients are secondary to the chromatin changes.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) is the most common inherited ataxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). The ataxia, which is recessively inherited, is relentlessly progressive with patients frequently becoming wheelchair-bound in their early teens. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is a common co-morbid feature of FRDA, with congestive heart failure being a frequent cause of death. The most common cause of FRDA is the expansion of a GAA&#x02022;TTC-repeat (henceforth referred to as the <italic>FXN</italic> repeats) in intron 1 of the frataxin gene (<italic>FXN</italic>). Unaffected individuals have at least one allele with 8&#x02013;33 repeats, while most individuals with FRDA have 90 or more repeats in both alleles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). These expanded alleles produce less mature <italic>FXN</italic> mRNA than alleles in the normal range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). This results in a deficiency of frataxin, an essential protein thought to be involved in mitochondrial iron metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>).</p><p>The <italic>FXN</italic> repeats form an intrinsic block to RNA polymerase <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>), suggesting one potential mechanism for the <italic>FXN</italic> mRNA deficit. However, the <italic>FXN</italic> repeats may affect transcription in other ways. For example, the long stretches of tandem repeats present in normal human centromeres are associated with transcriptionally silent chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>) as are the genes containing the expanded triplet repeat tracts responsible for Fragile X syndrome and congenital myotonic dystrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). In addition, transgenes containing long GAA&#x02022;TTC-tracts become associated with heterochromatin when inserted into arbitrary locations in the mouse genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). It is thus possible that repeat-mediated chromatin changes also contribute to the reduction in <italic>FXN</italic> transcript in FRDA. In principle, changes in chromatin modifications in non-coding sequence could affect transcription by affecting RNA polymerase II elongation or by changing the accessibility of this region to regulatory factors important for transcription initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). Since the first intron of many genes contains regulatory sequences important for gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10 B11 B12 B13">10&#x02013;13</xref>) and the sequence adjacent to the <italic>FXN</italic> repeat is the region of intron 1 most likely to be affected by repeat expansion, we examined the contributions of this region to <italic>FXN</italic> promoter activity. We also examined the chromatin modifications and DNA methylation status of this region in cells from unaffected individuals and individuals with FRDA. We have identified a region that is important for maximal <italic>FXN</italic> gene expression and shown that repeat expansion leads to changes in DNA methylation and chromatin organization in this region. Our data also suggests how these changes may lead to the frataxin deficit responsible for FRDA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title><italic>In silico</italic> analysis of intron 1</title><p>Primate sequences in the region of intron 1 immediately 5&#x02032; of the <italic>FXN</italic> repeat were aligned using the online version of the Multalin algorithm [(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>); <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://prodes.toulouse.inra.fr/multalin/multalin.html">http://prodes.toulouse.inra.fr/multalin/multalin.html</ext-link>].

The region 5&#x02032; of the GAA repeat in the <italic>FXN</italic> gene was amplified by PCR using the primers <italic>FXN</italic>Me1212-F and <italic>FXN</italic>Me1930-R. The PCR fragments were gel purified, digested with XhoI and EcoRI, cloned into pBS SK+ (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA) and sequenced. Five clones from each individual were sequenced. The data for each population was pooled and the frequency with which each residue was methylated was then plotted along with the standard deviation.</p></sec><sec><title>Reporter assays</title><p>The primer <italic>FXN</italic>PrF was used as the forward primer for all constructs. This primer has an MluI site at its 5&#x02032; end and primes 1118&#x02009;bp upstream of the start of <italic>FXN</italic> translation. Each of the reverse primers contained the splice acceptor site from the 3&#x02032; end of intron 1 and an NcoI site and were designed so that the <italic>FXN</italic> coding sequence in exon 1 would be translated in frame with the luciferase open reading frame from pGL3-Basic (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). After PCR amplification, the gel-purified fragment was digested with MluI and NcoI and cloned into pGL3-Basic. The numbers in the construct names are based on the location of the reverse primer in the chromosome 9 sequence from the May 2004 freeze of the human genome in the UCSC database with the numbering starting at 68 800 000. Thus the 3&#x02032; end of the <italic>FXN</italic> sequence in construct <italic>FXN</italic>80940 corresponds to base 68 880 940 in the chromosome 9 sequence. <italic>FXN</italic>81423 contains 1006 bases from the 5&#x02032; end of intron 1 terminating at position 68 881 423, and <italic>FXN</italic>81658 contains the first 1241 bases of intron 1 and terminates at position 68 881 658. <italic>FXN</italic> E-box/Mt+ and <italic>FXN</italic> E-box/Mt&#x02212; clones were generated using reverse primers that contain either the <italic>FXN</italic> intron E-box/Mt sequence or the sequence immediately downstream of this region. The resultant clones differ only by eight bases.

However, almost nothing was known about the region of intron 1 containing the <italic>FXN</italic> repeat. Since sequences important for promoter activity can be located in the first intron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10 B11 B12 B13">10&#x02013;13</xref>) and the sequences closest to the repeat are the ones most likely to be affected by repeat expansion, we set out to examine this region in some detail. The organization of the 5&#x02032; end of the <italic>FXN</italic> gene is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A. Intron 1 is 10 436&#x02009;bp long. The <italic>FXN</italic> repeat is located 1340&#x02009;bp from the beginning of the intron. The region of intron 1 between exon 1 and the <italic>FXN</italic> repeat contains three interspersed repeated DNA elements. This includes a member of the ancient MIRb family of repeated DNA elements that is thought to have been active in transposition before the mammalian radiation, Charlie8, a member of the primate-specific MER1 (medium reiteration 1) family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>) and the first half of the Alu element from which the <italic>FXN</italic> repeat is thought to have been derived (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). <fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>The 5&#x02032; end of the frataxin gene.

Bisulfite analysis demonstrates that a number of CpG residues were methylated in cell lines from both individuals with FRDA and unaffected individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). However, the average methylation density was &#x0223c;50% higher in cells from affected individuals (compare the heights of the black and gray bars in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). This reflects, in part, the fact that the methylation density decreased more slowly 5&#x02032; of the repeat tract in these cells. The basal level of methylation seen in unaffected individuals may be due to methylation spreading from the downstream Alu element since these elements are themselves frequently methylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). In addition to an overall increase in methylation in FRDA cells, certain residues were much more likely to be methylated in these cells than in those without the disease. For example residues 3, 6, and 13 are methylated in 75&#x02013;100% of alleles from patients, while they were completely free from methylation in unaffected individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). DNA from fresh blood of four unrelated individuals with FRDA showed a similar methylation of residues 3, 6 and 13 to DNA (data not shown), suggesting that this methylation is not an artifact of the transformation process. Thus normal alleles seem to have a naturally occurring &#x02018;methylation footprint&#x02019; that is absent from FRDA alleles. The elevated level of methylation seen in FRDA cells disappeared 5&#x02032; of residue 3 with overall levels of methylation in both populations falling to 20% at residue 1. Thus the repeat-mediated increase in DNA methylation is limited to the region immediately adjacent to the repeat. This conclusion is consistent with the lack of any DNA methylation in the promoter of either population group (data not shown). <fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Methylation status of 15 CpG residues in the region 5&#x02032; of the <italic>FXN</italic> repeat in cells from unaffected and affected individuals.

If the latter were true, we might expect that deletion of these regions could affect <italic>FXN</italic> promoter activity in transient transfection assays. We therefore generated reporter constructs containing the promoter, exon 1, and various lengths of intron 1. Downstream of the intron 1 sequence in each construct was the branch and splice acceptor sites from the end of intron 1, and the luciferase coding sequence.

A construct <italic>FXN</italic>81423 that terminated 235 bases 5&#x02032; of the sequence in <italic>FXN</italic>81658, and therefore that lacked residue 13, had a luciferase activity that was only &#x0223c;10% that of the full length construct <italic>FXN</italic>81658 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A). A construct <italic>FXN</italic>80940 that terminated 718 bases 5&#x02032; of <italic>FXN</italic>81423, and thus lacked residue 3 and 6 had an activity very similar to that of <italic>FXN</italic>81423. As can be seen from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>D, treatment of <italic>FXN</italic>81658 and <italic>FXN</italic>81423 transfected cells with the transcription inhibitor Actinomycin D resulted in very similar levels of luciferase protein and mRNA after 8&#x02009;h of treatment. This suggests that the absolute difference in luciferase activity between the two constructs reflects differences in transcription rates rather than differences in RNA stability. Thus, it is likely that the 235&#x02009;bp region of intron 1 containing residue 13 has a binding site for one or more transcription factors that make a significant positive contribution to the <italic>FXN</italic> promoter activity. <fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>The effect of different lengths of intron 1 sequence on the activity of the <italic>FXN</italic> promoter.

This site overlaps with a binding site for the muscle specific Mt transcription factor. We generated two constructs differing only in eight bases. The first construct included the E-box/Mt-binding site and the second terminated just 5&#x02032; of the E-box and was thus missing both sites. We measured the activity of these constructs in C2C12 cells. The construct lacking the E-box/Mt-binding site had a significantly lower luciferase activity than the construct containing these regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B). As can be seen from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>D, Actinomycin D treatment had a similar effect on the yield of luciferase RNA and protein of both of these constructs. These findings support the idea that the original differences in luciferase activity we observe without Actinomycin D reflects a higher promoter activity for the construct with the E-box/Mt-binding site rather than enhanced mRNA stability.</p></sec><sec><title>The E-box/Mt region binds transcription factors in extracts from muscle cells</title><p>Three protein&#x02013;DNA complexes were found in electrophoretic mobility shift assays with C2C12 cells using the E-box/Mt region as a probe (complexes I, II and III in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>, lane 2). Complexes I and II could be competed out by addition of E-boxcon, an oligonucleotide that contains a consensus E-box-binding site. Thus members of a large family of basic Helix-Loop-Helix E-box-binding proteins that includes MyoD and c-myc have the potential to bind this region. Complex III could be competed out by an oligonucleotide that contains a truncated E-box and the intact Mt-binding site (<italic>FXN</italic> E-box&#x00394;, F <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>, lane 5). Complex III thus probably represents the complex formed by a protein bound at the Mt-binding site.

M.eco72I from <italic>E. coli</italic> RFL72 is a DNA methyltransferase that specifically methylates the CpG residue in the sequence 5&#x02032;-CACGTG-3&#x02032; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Thus the <italic>FXN</italic> E-box is a substrate for this enzyme and the site it methylates corresponds to residue 13. Since there are no other sites that can be methylated by this enzyme in the reporter construct, this methylase can be used to examine the effect of methylation of this residue specifically. Methylation had no effect on the activity of a reporter construct transfected into C2C12 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C). Thus methylation of residue 13 <italic>per se</italic> is unlikely to be the primary cause of the <italic>FXN</italic> deficiency.</p></sec><sec><title>Affected individuals have elevated levels of H3K9Me2</title><p>Increased methylation of residue 13 may be a secondary consequence of a more compact chromatin organization which blocks factor binding. Since chromatin compaction is associated with elevated levels of H3K9Me2, we analyzed intron 1 in four FRDA patients for the presence of this histone modification. Elevated levels of H3K9Me2 were seen in these individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A), all of whom had <italic>FXN</italic> mRNA levels 10&#x02013;30% that of unaffected individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B). While this manuscript was in preparation a similar observation was reported for another lymphoblastoid cell line from a FRDA patient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). The increase in H3K9Me2 is consistent with the fact that treatment of FRDA lymphocytes with histone deacetylase inhibitors increases <italic>FXN</italic> transcription significantly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>) since H3K9 acetylation blocks K9 methylation. Our data thus support the idea that a chromatin-based mechanism is responsible for the <italic>FXN</italic> mRNA deficit in FRDA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). <fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p><italic>FXN</italic> histone H3 K9 dimethylation and mRNA levels in unaffected and affected individuals.

Our data also suggests another way in which the chromatin modification at the <italic>FXN</italic> gene can lead to the mRNA deficit. In the absence of an expanded repeat tract, intron 1 binds proteins that positively affect <italic>FXN</italic> transcription. A secondary effect of this binding is that it creates natural &#x02018;methylation footprints&#x02019; by protecting the binding sites from DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). The more compact chromatin formed on alleles with large <italic>FXN</italic> repeats blocks access of these proteins to the DNA as evidenced by disappearance of the &#x02018;methylation footprints&#x02019;. Absence of binding of these transcription factors may lead to a reduction in transcription initiation. One implication of this model is that DNA methylation may be a secondary consequence of the histone modifications. This may explain why histone deacetylase inhibitors are so effective at increasing <italic>FXN</italic> gene expression in FRDA cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). <fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p>Model for chromatin organization in the region containing residue 13 in normal and FRDA alleles.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkm271f6"/></fig></p><p>How could the long <italic>FXN</italic>-repeat tracts in patient cells generate transcriptionally silent chromatin? One possibility is that this process involves small double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) that target the transcriptional silencing machinery to homologous regions of the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). Potential sources of these dsRNAs are regions of transcripts that can form hairpins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>) or overlapping sense and antisense transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). Long GAA-repeat tracts form DNA hairpins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). This raises the possibility that RNA containing these repeats may also do so. However, since a low level of modified chromatin exists at the frataxin locus even when the repeat number is too small to form stable hairpins, it is tempting to speculate that an antisense mechanism is involved at least when the repeat number is low.</p><p>Repeat-mediated heterochromatin formation is seen in two other Repeat Expansion diseases: Fragile X syndrome and the congenital form of Myotonic Dystrophy type 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Thus repeat-mediated transcriptional silencing may provide a common thread linking these diseases where the repeat is transcribed but not translated.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>The authors thank Ann Dean (NIDDK) for her thoughtful comments and advice.
