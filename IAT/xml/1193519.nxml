These can range from deciding to stop or continue feeding, or to look for alternate food sources. The nutrient signals can derive internally, reflecting the body's energy state and metabolic need, or through external sensory inputs, such as olfactory and gustatory signals. The sensory modalities further provide the basis for many types of higher brain functions, such as learning and memory. Feeding behavior, in turn, decisively influences almost all aspects of animal growth and reproduction. The role of the central nervous system (CNS) in integrating an animal's feeding behavior with sensory signals on the availability and quality of nutrients is, although undisputed, insufficiently understood &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030305-b01">1</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p><italic>Drosophila</italic> provides a genetically accessible system to study the molecular mechanisms that coordinate feeding behavior with sensory signals. This organism has an array of feeding characteristics that can be exploited for behavioral analysis, and insects in general have been used extensively as models for a wide range of behavioral and physiological studies &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030305-b02">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030305-b03">3</xref>&#x0005d;. In this context, the identification of genes encoding chemosensory receptors in <italic>Drosophila</italic> has provided a major impetus in understanding sensory signal transduction &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030305-b04">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030305-b08">8</xref>&#x0005d;. These genes have been broadly divided as encoding olfactory or gustatory receptors (ORs and GRs, respectively). Olfactory sensory neurons expressing specific ORs in the external mouth region project axons to distinct glomeruli of the antennal lobe &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030305-b08">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030305-b12">12</xref>&#x0005d;. Projection neurons then connect the antennal lobe to the mushroom body, where central processing of olfactory information occurs &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030305-b13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030305-b15">15</xref>&#x0005d;. Gustatory sensory neurons are located not only in the external mouth region, but also internally in the pharynx; both types project to the subesophageal ganglion (SOG), a region implicated in feeding and taste response &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030305-b08">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030305-b16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030305-b18">18</xref>&#x0005d;. As compared with the antennal lobe, much less is known about the organization of the SOG&#x02014;for example, whether it is also organized in glomerular structure. The neurons that connect the SOG to higher brain centers, in a manner analogous to the olfactory projection neurons, have also not been identified.</p><p>In both olfactory and gustatory cases, the knowledge is even sparser concerning the identity of interneurons that act between the sensory neurons and motor or neuroendocrine outputs and how they might influence feeding behavior. Studies in different insects have shown that various parts of the CNS are interconnected with the neuroendocrine organs and the enteric (stomatogastric) nervous system, which innervates the feeding apparatus &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030305-b19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030305-b20">20</xref>&#x0005d;. The mouth parts have also been shown to be innervated by nerves from the SOG &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030305-b21">21</xref>&#x0005d;. Nevertheless, an integrated map of the neurons comprising these circuits and their function in mediating a behavioral response has been lacking.</p><p>We have previously identified a gene, <italic>pumpless</italic><italic>(ppl),</italic> that is required for food intake behavior in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030305-b22">22</xref>&#x0005d;. It encodes a subunit of the glycine cleavage system and is expressed exclusively in the fat body. Although not feeding, <italic>ppl</italic> mutant larvae do not show characteristics of starving larvae, as assayed both by molecular markers and behavioral characteristics; furthermore, feeding high levels of amino acids can phenocopy several aspects of the <italic>ppl</italic> feeding phenotype. These observations led to a model in which amino acid-dependent signals from the fat body to the brain can signal cessation of feeding. In this study, we characterize another mutant, <italic>klumpfuss</italic><italic>(klu),</italic> with a phenotype very similar to <italic>ppl</italic> mutants. Through microarray analysis, we identified the neuropeptide gene <italic>hugin (hug)</italic> as being deregulated in <italic>klu</italic> mutants. <italic>hug</italic> is expressed in a small assembly of about 20 neurons in the SOG. Connectivity mapping and behavioral studies suggest that <italic>hug</italic>-expressing neurons function in a neural circuitry in the brain that modulates chemosensory signal-dependent feeding behavior.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Molecular Characterization of Larval Mutant Defective in Feeding Behavior</title><p>In a screen for <italic>Drosophila</italic> mutant larvae defective in feeding, we identified the P-element line P(9036). These animals fail to pump food from the pharynx into the esophagus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030305-g001">Figure 1</xref>A), which is not due to a morphological block in the esophagus. The failure to feed is also not due to a general illness of the animal or global locomotory defects, because they can move around with the same vigor as wild-type or heterozygote siblings. P(9036) larvae also display wandering-like behavior, in which they move away from the food (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030305-g001">Figure 1</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030305-g001">1</xref>C). During this wandering-like phase, P(9036<italic>)</italic> larvae move about with food lodged in their pharynx, further supporting the view that the feeding defect is not due to a general body movement defect. Wandering behavior is observed in wild-type larvae when they stop feeding and move away from food shortly before pupariation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030305-b23">23</xref>&#x0005d;. These feeding behavior defects have also been observed for <italic>ppl</italic> mutants &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030305-b22">22</xref>&#x0005d;. <italic>ppl</italic> encodes an amino acid catabolizing enzyme that is expressed exclusively in the fat body, an organ analogous to the vertebrate liver. Thus, P(9036) and <italic>ppl</italic> mutants, as immature first instar larvae, display feeding behaviors characteristic of sated, full-grown, third instar larvae. We characterized the gene corresponding to P(9036) and found it to be <italic>klu,</italic> a zinc finger protein-encoding gene that is expressed specifically in the developing nervous system &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030305-b24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030305-b25">25</xref>&#x0005d;.

We reasoned that their expression patterns in the brain would be specific enough for analysis at single-cell resolution. Furthermore, neuropeptides have been shown to influence food intake in different organisms, including mammals &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030305-b01">1</xref>&#x0005d;.

We then performed in situ hybridizations on wild-type larval brains with the six highest upregulated genes. We decided to focus our efforts on <italic>hug</italic> because it had the most specific expression pattern in the larval brain. While all others showed staining in different parts of the brain or in the ventral nerve cord (VNC) (unpublished data), <italic>hug</italic> showed staining in only a cluster of about 20 cells in the SOG of the larval brain, with no staining anywhere else (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030305-g001">Figures 1</xref>F and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030305-g002">2</xref>). Its expression in embryos is also highly restricted in the brain &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030305-b26">26</xref>&#x0005d;. <italic>hug</italic> encodes a prepropeptide capable of generating at least two neuropeptides, Drm-PK2 and hug-&#x003b3;.

We then investigated whether <italic>hug</italic> expression is also regulated in <italic>ppl</italic> larvae, which display a similar feeding defect as <italic>klu</italic>. There is also an upregulation of <italic>hug</italic> in <italic>ppl</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030305-g001">Figure 1</xref>H). We next investigated whether <italic>hug</italic> expression is regulated by different nutrient signals. We therefore placed wild-type larvae in starvation and sugar conditions (that is, both being amino acid-deficient diets) and monitored <italic>hug</italic> expression. <italic>hug</italic> was downregulated in both conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030305-g001">Figure 1</xref>I, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030305-g001">1</xref>J, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030305-g001">1</xref>K), indicating a response to nutrient signals distinct from simple lack of energy. As <italic>hug</italic> is upregulated in <italic>klu</italic> and in <italic>ppl</italic> mutants, both of which do not feed and wander about, a higher <italic>hug</italic> level correlates with decrease of food intake and food-seeking behavior. For <italic>hug</italic> downregulation under starvation and sugar conditions, a lower <italic>hug</italic> level correlates with increased food-seeking behavior since <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae become hyperactive and disperse when food is removed.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title><italic>hug-</italic>Expressing Neurons Project to the Ring Gland, the Pharyngeal Muscles, and the Protocerebrum</title><p>As mentioned above, <italic>hug</italic> is expressed specifically in a small group of neurons in the SOG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030305-g002">Figure 2</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030305-g002">2</xref>B). To gain insight into the physiological processes that <italic>hug</italic>-expressing neurons (referred to as <italic>hug</italic> neurons) could be involved in, we wanted to determine their connectivity pattern. Therefore, we constructed a <italic>hug</italic> promoter-Gal4 line (hugS3) in order to express different versions of green fluorescent protein (GFP) marker genes for neuroanatomical studies. This approach revealed <italic>hug</italic> neuron projection to the ring gland (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030305-g002">Figure 2</xref>C). The ring gland, as the master neuroendocrine organ of <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae, controls metabolism and growth. For example, median neurosecretory cells of the pars intercerebralis that express <italic>Drosophila</italic> insulin like peptides (dilps), also project to the ring gland, whereas adipokinetic hormone (akh), thought to be a glucagon homolog, is produced by the ring gland &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030305-b29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030305-b31">31</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>In addition to the ring gland, we also observed <italic>hug</italic> neuron projection to the protocerebrum, near the median neurosecretory cells and the mushroom bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030305-g002">Figure 2</xref>D&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030305-g002">2</xref>F), which comprise the center for olfactory learning and memory &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030305-b13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030305-b32">32</xref>&#x0005d;. The axons projecting to the protocerebrum also cross at the midline just above the foramen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030305-g002">Figure 2</xref>I). We also noticed an intriguing glomerular-like structure of what are most likely <italic>hug</italic> dendrites in the SOG, just dorsoanterior to the <italic>hug</italic> cell bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030305-g002">Figure 2</xref>G and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030305-g002">2</xref>H). Singh &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030305-b17">17</xref>&#x0005d; has described glomerular organization in the SOG of adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> that relays gustatory information. Such a glomerular organization has not been previously recognized for the larval SOG, but it would be analogous to the glomerular organization in the antennal lobes that relay olfactory information.</p><p>Strikingly, there is also projection of <italic>hug</italic> neurons to the pharyngeal muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030305-g002">Figure 2</xref>J, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030305-g002">2</xref>K, and 2L), which pump food into the mouth atrium. These arise from axons that leave the brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030305-g002">Figure 2</xref>J) and project anteriorly along each side of the dorsal pharyngeal muscles, and terminate near the anterior end of the pharynx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030305-g002">Figures 2</xref>K, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030305-g002">2</xref>L, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030305-g004">4</xref>). There has been no previous case of identified neurons in the larval SOG that project to motor outputs. At this point, we do not know whether the pharyngeal muscles are actually innervated by these axons. Taken together, these results demonstrate that <italic>hug</italic> neurons in the larvae project to key organs regulating feeding and growth&#x02014;namely, the pharynx and the ring gland&#x02014;as well as to higher brain centers.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title><italic>hug</italic> Dendrites Innervate GR-Expressing Sensory Organs and Chemosensory Organs of the Pharynx</title><p>The projection of <italic>hug</italic> neurons to the mushroom body region, together with the fact that <italic>hug</italic> is expressed specifically in the SOG, which relays gustatory information, suggested that <italic>hug</italic> neurons could be involved in mediating chemosensory signals. Therefore, we investigated whether <italic>hug</italic> neurons receive direct input from the chemosensory organs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030305-g003">Figure 3</xref>A&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030305-g003">3</xref>D). It has been demonstrated that sensory organs in the larval head that express ORs or GRs send their axons either to the antennal lobe or the SOG &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030305-b08">8</xref>&#x0005d; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030305-g003">Figure 3</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030305-g003">3</xref>B).

As internal pharyngeal sensory organs are good candidates for transducing gustatory signals, we wondered if these sensory organs terminate at <italic>hug</italic> dendrites. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030305-g003">Figure 3</xref>E and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030305-g003">3</xref>F, they indeed terminate in the contact region of <italic>hug</italic> dendrites.</p><p>To further test this, we checked to see if chemosensory neurons that express specific GRs also project to <italic>hug</italic> dendrites. For example, it has been shown that GR66C1-positive neurons project to the SOG, whereas GR21D1-positive neurons project to the antennal lobe &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030305-b08">8</xref>&#x0005d;. To see if these sensory projections terminate at or near <italic>hug</italic> neurons, we first performed staining of GR66C1- and GR21D1-positive axon terminals with <italic>hug</italic> in situ hybridization. GR66C1 receptor neurons indeed project to the vicinity of <italic>hug</italic>-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030305-g003">Figure 3</xref>G). To see if these axons may potentially make synaptic contacts with <italic>hug</italic> dendrites, we used a <italic>hug</italic> promoter&#x02013;yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) line (in which YFP was placed directly under the <italic>hug</italic> promoter), in combination with GR promoters driving nSyb-GFP &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030305-b08">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030305-b33">33</xref>&#x0005d;, thus allowing simultaneous visualization of GR axon terminals and <italic>hug</italic> dendrites. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030305-g003">Figure 3</xref>H, GR66C1-positive neurons project to the glomerular-like SOG region contacted by <italic>hug</italic> dendrites. GR21D1-positive neurons also project near the <italic>hug</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030305-g003">Figure 3</xref>I), but by contrast to GR66C1-positive neurons, do not contact <italic>hug</italic> dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030305-g003">Figure 3</xref>J).

Taken together, these results suggested that <italic>hug</italic> neurons may act as second-order interneurons that relay gustatory information.</p><p>To further distinguish the relationship between <italic>hug</italic> neurons and the olfactory or gustatory systems, we determined whether <italic>hug</italic> neurons share the same axon tracts to the mushroom bodies as the second-order neurons that relay olfactory sensory input. The dendrites of these olfactory projection neurons underlie the glomerular structure of the antennal lobes and vertically transduce olfactory information for processing to the mushroom bodies. These projections can be visualized by the enhancer trap line GH146 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030305-b14">14</xref>&#x0005d;.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030305-g004">Figure 4</xref>D, specific <italic>hug</italic> neurons express TH-Gal4 reporter gene, indicating that a subset of <italic>hug</italic> neurons might be dopaminergic. When TH-Gal4-driven lacZ is used in combination with <italic>hug</italic> promoter-YFP, we observe that TH-positive <italic>hug</italic> neurons project to only the pharynx and not to the protocerebrum, the ring gland, or the VNC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030305-g004">Figure 4</xref>E). These results indicate that at least three distinct subpopulations of <italic>hug</italic> neurons exist: those projecting to only the ring gland, those projecting to only the pharyngeal muscles, and those projecting to the protocerebrum and/or the VNC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030305-g004">Figure 4</xref>F). The distinct target specificity suggests differences in the function of the <italic>hug</italic> subpopulations. In the honeybee <italic>Apis,</italic> the subesophageal-calycal tract neurons are located in the SOG, send axons to the protocerebrum, and receive input from the sensory neurons of the proboscis; these neurons are thought to transduce gustatory information &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030305-b36">36</xref>&#x0005d;. Some of the <italic>hug</italic> neurons could act similarly to these honeybee neurons. Based on the connectivity map of the <italic>hug</italic> neurons, we also wondered if the global targeting of these neurons was altered in <italic>klu</italic> mutant larvae. Therefore, we crossed the <italic>hug</italic> promoter-YFP construct into <italic>klu</italic> mutant background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030305-g004">Figures 4</xref>G and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030305-g004">4</xref>H). Although we cannot rule out subtle local differences, the basic connectivity pattern is retained in the mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030305-g004">Figure 4</xref>I).</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title><italic>hug</italic> Neuron Connectivity Pattern Is Similar in Larvae and Adults</title><p>To see if <italic>hug</italic> neurons might also have a function in the adults, we determined the connectivity pattern in adult animals. There are some noticeable morphological differences in the feeding apparatus and neuroendocrine organs between adults and larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030305-g005">Figure 5</xref>A). One is the presence of the crop in the adult but not in the larva. The crop is a food storage organ, and its absence in the larvae most likely reflects a difference in the feeding habits; whereas adults are intermittent feeders, the larvae feed continuously. Another is the relocation of the neuroendocrine organs. The corpora cardiaca/corpora allata (CC/CA) complex, which comprises part of the ring gland in the larvae, is located right above the proventriculus in the adults, at the junction between the gut and the crop. This is in contrast to the larvae, where it is located on top of the brain hemispheres. Monitoring hugS3 expression in adults, we observe axon projections to the protocerebrum, the CC/CA complex, and the ventral cord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030305-g005">Figure 5</xref>B&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030305-g005">5</xref>H). A subpopulation of <italic>hug</italic> neurons may also be dopaminergic, as in the larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030305-g005">Figure 5</xref>I). To further characterize the projections to the protocerebrum, we used the OK107 enhancer trap Gal4 line &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030305-b37">37</xref>&#x0005d; together with <italic>hug</italic> promoter-YFP. These stainings indicate that <italic>hug</italic> axons traverse along the median neurosecretory cells in the pars intercerebralis, and terminate near the mushroom bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030305-g005">Figure 5</xref>J and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030305-g005">5</xref>K). A similar pattern is observed in the larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030305-g005">Figure 5</xref>L and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030305-g005">5</xref>M). The precise targets of <italic>hug</italic> neurons projecting to the protocerebrum remain to be determined. Taken together, despite the morphological differences, the connectivity pattern of <italic>hug</italic> neurons is remarkably similar between larvae and adults.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Blocking Synaptic Transmission of <italic>hug</italic> Neurons Alters Food Intake Behavior</title><p>Based on the connectivity map of <italic>hug</italic> neurons and the alteration in <italic>hug</italic> expression under different nutrient and feeding conditions, we initiated a series of experiments to explore the role of <italic>hug</italic> in regulating feeding. As <italic>hug</italic> mutants have not yet been identified, we tested the effects of overexpressing <italic>hug</italic> in the larvae. We first used hugS3 to drive <italic>hug</italic> expression but did not observe any phenotype (unpublished data). This is most likely because using an endogenous promoter does not result in high enough overexpression of <italic>hug</italic> in cells that already express physiological levels of <italic>hug</italic>. We therefore used a strong ubiquitous promoter (tubulin-gal4). There was a strong reduction in growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030305-g006">Figure 6</xref>A), with no larvae surviving to pupal stage; we also observed defects in food intake, although not to the same strong degree as with <italic>klu</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030305-g006">Figure 6</xref>A). This is consistent with the view outlined earlier that high <italic>hug</italic> levels correlate with decreased food intake.</p><p>In order to gain further information on the function of <italic>hug</italic> neurons, we then blocked synaptic transmission in these cells using tetanus toxin light chain (TeTxLC) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030305-b38">38</xref>&#x0005d;. We first carried out the experiments in the larvae but did not see any difference (unpublished data). However, we reasoned that any potential increase in feeding response may not be readily detectable in the larvae because they feed continuously, already at a maximal rate. Therefore, we tested whether blocking synaptic transmission of <italic>hug</italic> neurons could suppress the feeding defect of <italic>klu</italic> mutants. We indeed observed a significant rescue of <italic>klu</italic> mutant feeding phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030305-g006">Figure 6</xref>B).</p><p>We then carried out behavioral analysis on adults, since they are discontinuous feeders and thus may display an increased feeding behavior. Furthermore, one can visualize the quantity of food eaten by the size of the crop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030305-g006">Figure 6</xref>C). Experimental and control flies were placed in food vials containing standard fly food for several days. They were then transferred to yeast paste containing red dye. A striking result was observed. After 5 min, the experimental flies had a completely filled crop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030305-g006">Figure 6</xref>D, left column), whereas the control lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030305-g006">Figure 6</xref>D, middle and right columns) had very little food in the crop. Even after 30 min, the control flies had very little food in their crops and only traces of red food were detectable in the midgut. By 180 min, both experimental and control flies showed the same degree of feeding. These results suggested that <italic>hug</italic> neurons are involved in regulating the initiation phase of feeding: control flies wait for a certain period before initiating feeding on the new food source, whereas decreasing <italic>hug</italic> neuronal signaling results in flies initiating their feeding immediately. When flies were transferred from yeast to colored yeast, or normal food to colored normal food, no difference was seen between experimental and control flies (unpublished data), indicating that <italic>hug</italic> neurons are not simply affecting the rate of feeding per se; we also did not observe a difference when transferring from yeast to normal food, indicating that the <italic>hug</italic> neuron-dependent behavioral effect is also not due to a simple fact of changing food sources. When flies were transferred from normal food into yeast containing 1M quinine (quinine is an aversive tastant), experimental flies again filled their crops earlier than controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg001">Figure S1</xref>). However, when flies were kept on yeast containing 1M quinine, and then transferred to yeast without the quinine, both experimental and control flies filled their crops with the new yeast within 5 min (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg001">Figure S1</xref>); analogously, when flies were starved before placing them on red yeast, both control and experimental flies filled their crops at about the same rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030305-g006">Figure 6</xref>D, bottom row). These results suggest that the quality of previous food condition plays a role in defining <italic>hug</italic> neuronal function. Taken together, our studies support the view that <italic>hug</italic> neurons act within a neural circuitry in the brain that modulates feeding behavior based on chemosensory and nutrient signals.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Central Relay of Gustatory Information</title><p>The identification of candidate chemosensory receptors in mammals and invertebrates has provided major insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying sensory information processing. In the <italic>Drosophila</italic> olfactory system, projections of OR-expressing sensory organs terminate at specific glomerular structures in the antennal lobe. The olfactory projection neurons then act in a second relay to convey the information to the mushroom bodies in the higher brain region. The gustatory organs, expressing specific GRs, project to a different brain region, the SOG, which has been implicated in gustatory signal transduction and feeding response in different insects. Our results indicate that the neurons that express the <italic>hug</italic> neuropeptide gene are likely candidates for acting as interneurons that transduce gustatory information. These comprise an assembly of about 20 neurons in the SOG. The close proximity of their dendrites with the axon terminals of gustatory sensory organs of the external head, and chemosensory organs of the internal pharynx, suggests a synaptic contact, but this requires functional verification. Whether the SOG is also organized into glomerular structure, like the antennal lobe, is not known. Such an organization has been suggested in adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030305-b17">17</xref>&#x0005d;, although data on larvae have been lacking. Our results on the dendritic pattern of <italic>hug</italic> neurons also suggest a glomerular structure of the larval SOG, but this remains an open issue.</p><p>The <italic>hug</italic> neurons, in turn, send axons to at least three distinct targets: the ring gland, the pharyngeal muscles, and the protocerebrum. The projections to the ring gland and the pharyngeal muscles suggest that <italic>hug</italic> neurons coordinate sensory information with growth, metabolism, and food intake; the axon tracts to the protocerebrum suggest a role of <italic>hug</italic> neurons in transducing sensory signals for processing in the higher brain centers. These axon tracts are distinct from those of the olfactory projection neurons, projecting to a more dorsomedial region of the mushroom body, and adjacent to the median neurosecretory cells of the pars intercerebralis. Thus, <italic>hug</italic> neurons are ideally connected to undertake the role of integrating gustatory sensory signals with higher brain functions and feeding behavior.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Chemosensory Adaptation, Nutrient Status, and Food Intake Response</title><p>The chemosensory systems of all animals play critical roles in modulating feeding behavioral response. Feeding behavior can have diverse aspects, including locating a food source, evaluating food for nutritional appropriateness, choosing between different food sources, and deciding to initiate or terminate feeding. Blocking synaptic transmission by tetanus toxin in the <italic>hug</italic> neurons alters a specific aspect of the feeding behavioral response. When transferred to a certain new food source, the control flies wait for a period before initiating feeding, whereas experimental flies start feeding almost immediately. In both cases, the size of the crop after a longer feeding period does not change, meaning that no difference is seen in the termination phase of feeding. It is interesting to note that GR66C1 (also named GR66a) neurons, which project to <italic>hug</italic> dendrites, have recently been shown to mediate aversive taste response &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030305-b39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030305-b40">40</xref>&#x0005d;. This is consistent with the behavior of flies in which <italic>hug</italic> signaling is decreased, since they lose their &#x0201c;aversive&#x0201d; response, as manifested in the elimination of a wait period before feeding. This behavior is dependent on internal nutrient status, as well as food quality, since if animals are starved or given food with an aversive tastant beforehand (such as yeast with quinine), control flies also start feeding immediately on the new yeast source.</p><p>Insects have evolved a wide variety of feeding behaviors based on food identity, quality, and availability. Some of these are innate, whereas others are acquired through experience. For example, food preference in the tobacco hornworm is dependent on what they initially encounter after hatching. They are capable of growing on a wide variety of sources, but once they have fed on a particular food type, they will maintain this food preference &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030305-b41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030305-b42">42</xref>&#x0005d;. In this context, a possible scenario is that <italic>Drosophila</italic> associate feeding with a particular food source with which they become familiar. When they encounter a different food source, they must first re-evaluate it, perhaps for nutrient content, or adapt to it, before initiating feeding. Therefore, <italic>hug</italic> neurons appear to regulate the decision to initiate feeding based on previous food experience.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Central Integration of Feeding Behavior and Growth</title><p>In animals with a developed endocrine system, there is an intricate interdependence among feeding, growth, and neuroendocrine activity. <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae are characterized by continuous feeding and a huge increase in organismal growth; in the adult, although no growth at organismal level takes place, a large cellular growth is required in the female for egg production. Both are highly dependent on feeding and the quality of food, such as protein content, and are under neuroendocrine control &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030305-b02">2</xref>&#x0005d;. <italic>klu</italic> and <italic>ppl</italic> represent two genes that are required for food intake and growth in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Mutations in both genes result in reduced food intake and growth. In addition, as young larvae, mutants display a wandering-like behavior, which is reminiscent of full-grown wild-type larvae, which stop feeding and move away from the food source just prior to pupariation, a process dependent on the neuroendocrine system &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030305-b23">23</xref>&#x0005d;. Mutations in either of the genes lead to an upregulation of <italic>hug</italic> neuropeptide gene expression in the brain, whereas <italic>hug</italic> expression is downregulated in the absence of food signals.</p><p>What could be the function of the <italic>hug</italic> neuropeptides? <italic>hug</italic> encodes at least two distinct neuropeptides &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030305-b26">26</xref>&#x0005d;. One <italic>(hug-</italic>&#x003b3;<italic>)</italic> has homology to an ecdysone triggering hormone, while the second (Drm-PK-2) is a pyrokinin with myostimulatory activity. <italic>hug</italic>-&#x003b3; could be involved in controlling growth and metabolism. This view is supported by projection of <italic>hug</italic> neurons to the ring gland, the master neuroendocrine organ. In addition, overexpression of <italic>hug</italic> has been shown to cause molting defects &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030305-b26">26</xref>&#x0005d;. Drm-PK-2, on the other hand, may play a role in modifying the mechanical aspect of food intake, which is supported by the projection of <italic>hug</italic> neurons to the pharyngeal muscles. One interesting possibility is that the different neuropeptides are translated or trafficked to different targets in subset of <italic>hug</italic> neurons. In this case, a common gene expression pattern can be utilized to send out different signals to the different targets, such as to the higher brain center, feeding apparatus, and neuroendocrine organ. This would be a mechanism for coordinating different growth-dependent processes with a common input signal, for example, from a particular food signal. In this context, one way to explain the upregulation of the <italic>hug</italic> gene in <italic>klu</italic> and <italic>ppl</italic> mutants would be that the level of <italic>hug</italic> gene differentially correlates with the degree of food-seeking response. High levels, as in the mutants that do not feed, would reflect lower feeding and food-seeking response, whereas low levels, as in the absence of food sensory input, would reflect increased food-seeking response. This would also be consistent with <italic>hug</italic> overexpression studies and with the correlation seen between decreasing <italic>hug</italic> neuronal activity and increased feeding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030305-g007">Figure 7</xref>).
