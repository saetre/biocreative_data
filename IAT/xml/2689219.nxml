Serpins are functionally diverse but structurally conserved proteins found in all three domains of life.

Plant serpins are also potent proteinase inhibitors, but their physiological roles are largely unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Six <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>genes encoding full-length serpins were differentially expressed in developing seedlings and mature tissues.

Plants utilize several pathways for DNA repair, including photoreactivation, nucleotide excision repair, base excision repair, mismatch repair and double-stranded break repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) is a simple, direct alkylating agent recognized as a standard for genotoxicity assays of environmental pollutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. MMS has been widely utilized as a &#x003b3;-radiation mimic in the belief it causes double-stranded breaks (DSBs). A recent report found, however, that no MMS-mediated DSBs could be detected <italic>in vivo </italic>in yeast or mammalian cells, and those reported previously were almost certainly artefacts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Molecular responses of organisms to alkylating phytotoxins are likely to be distinct from those to ionizing radiation.</p><p>Many intra- and extracellular processes in plant growth, development and responses to stress involve specific proteolytic enzyme activities. The <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>genome contains 656 known and putative peptidases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] but the functions of only a tiny minority are known. Furthermore, little is known of the control of proteolytic activity <italic>in planta </italic>by endogenous peptidase inhibitors, including the serpins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], which are one of seven families of peptidase inhibitors in <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Serpins are metastable inhibitors with a unique, irreversible mechanism of action [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>Almost all plant serpins studied are potent inhibitors of mammalian proteinases of the chymotrypsin family <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. An <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>serpin, AtSerpin1 (At1g47710), was shown to inhibit the endogenous cysteine proteinase Metacaspase 9 (AtMC9) <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] but no other putative endogenous targets for plant serpins have been identified. Plant serpins are likely to function in direct defence against proteinases from pests and pathogens and in the regulation of endogenous proteolytic events, but no functions have been demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Here we report the differential basal expression of six <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>serpin genes and the effect of MMS exposure of seedlings on the activity of <italic>AtSRP2 </italic>(At2g14540) and <italic>AtSRP3 </italic>(At1g64030), both specifically expressed in reproductive tissues.

One of the <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>serpins (At1g62170) was predicted to be non-inhibitory (based on P10 Thr and P11 Val) but each of the five remaining serpins was predicted to be inhibitory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] and has a unique reactive centre (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Amino acid sequence alignment of full-length <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>serpins</bold>.

This is consistent with the differential responses of our serpin mutants (vs. wild-type) to MMS but not to UV-C or &#x003b3;-radiation.</p></sec><sec><title>Knockouts of <italic>AtSRP2 </italic>and <italic>AtSRP3 </italic>transiently reduce responses to MMS exposure</title><p>Mutants <italic>atsrp2 </italic>and <italic>atsrp3 </italic>exposed to MMS displayed lower levels of induction of <italic>AtBRCA1</italic>, <italic>AtBARD1</italic>, <italic>AtRAD51 </italic>and <italic>AtCYCB1;1</italic>, as well as a downregulation of <italic>AtCYCD1;1</italic>, after 1 d compared to wild-type. Expression levels returned to wild-type levels 2 d after MMS exposure (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A&#x02013;C</xref>). Thus AtSRP2 and AtSRP3 may be required for relatively early responses to alkylation damage. In humans, <italic>BRCA1 </italic>appears to be involved in all phases of the cell cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and BRCA1 deficiency causes abnormalities in the S-phase and G2/M checkpoint [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. RAD51 is involved in homologous DNA repair and interacts with BRCA1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]; moreover, transcription of <italic>RAD51 </italic>(and <italic>AtRAD51</italic>) is highest in S-phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Yeast is most sensitive to MMS during S-phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Thus down-regulation of <italic>AtBRCA1 </italic>and <italic>AtRAD51 </italic>in the <italic>atsrp2 </italic>and <italic>atsrp3 </italic>mutants may be associated with abnormal S-phase and a defective G2/M checkpoint.</p><p>Transcripts of mitotic cyclin <italic>AtCYCB1;1 </italic>are reported to accumulate around the G2/M transition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], whereas <italic>AtCYCD1;1 </italic>promotes not only transition through G0/G1/S but also S/G2/M [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Cyclins (type D) are expressed throughout the cell cycle in proliferating plant tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. The CYCD1 interaction with cyclin-dependent protein kinase A (CDKA) acts at the G1/S and the G2/M boundaries in <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. These results suggest <italic>AtSRP2 </italic>and <italic>AtSRP3 </italic>may be involved in the regulation of different cell-cycle checkpoints in response to MMS-induced DNA damage. Interestingly, we detected no difference in <italic>AtATM </italic>expression between mutants and wild-type (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A&#x02013;C</xref>). The <italic>Arabidopsis atm </italic>mutant is hypersensitive to &#x003b3;-radiation and MMS but not to UV light [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The functions of AtSRP2 and AtSRP3 may be overlapping, as is found for AtATM and AtATR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], and they may be independent of AtATM in a DNA damage-response pathway; alternatively, both serpins may act downstream of AtATM.</p><p>Regulation of the cell cycle includes mechanisms for cell cycle arrest following DNA damage to allow time for repair of the DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Failure of these checkpoint responses leads to a build up of harmful mutations. Cell cycle arrest results in reduced rates of growth and a delay in the development of tissues. Lesions such as specific gene knockouts can interfere with the signal transduction required for the detection of DNA damage and responses including cell cycle arrest. We observed greater rates of growth of our <italic>atsrp2 </italic>and <italic>atsrp3 </italic>mutant plants exposed to MMS than that of wild-type plants given the same treatment. Thus we speculate that knockouts of these serpin genes result in de-repression of cell division following MMS treatment, thereby implicating AtSRP2 and AtSRP3 in the normal signal transduction required for the relevant checkpoint responses. It is important to note that Hefner et al. (2006) found that plant cell-cycle responses to ionizing radiation that were observed in meristematic tissues did not occur in strictly somatic tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Serpin-mediated control of proteolysis and its links to DNA damage responses</title><p>Sequence analysis strongly suggests AtSRP2 and AtSRP3 are inhibitory serpins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. AtSerpin1 can inhibit AtMC9, which is Arg/Lys specific [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In contrast, we predict AtSRP2 and AtSRP3 inhibit proteinases that cleave at small residues (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Since AtSRP2 is localized to the nucleus, its candidate targets are different than those for AtSRP3, which was localized to the cytosol (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>). Seventeen expressed genes encoding serpins with either P1 Gly or P1 Cys were recently identified from several monocots and eudicots [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Thus it is likely that serpins in other plant species are functional homologues of AtSRP2 and AtSRP3.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The inhibitory serpins encoded in the <italic>Arabidopsis </italic>genome display a variety of reactive centres, suggesting a range of target proteinases, and are differentially expressed, indicating a diversity of functions. Our results strongly suggest a new role for plant serpins, which is likely to involve inhibition of specific endogenous proteinases that target Gly and Cys residues to regulate plant responses to alkylating DNA damage. AtSRP2 and AtSRP3 are found in the cytosol and nucleus, respectively, and thus may perform distinct tasks in the signalling required for these responses. The requirement for AtSRP2 and AtSRP3 in responses to exposure to alkylating genotoxins but not to UV-C or &#x003b3;-radiation provides support for distinct biochemical pathways associated with these stresses. We suggest our data have potential importance for development of crops with greater resistance to alkylating genotoxins.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Plant materials and treatments with MMS, UV-C and &#x003b3;-radiation</title><p>Seeds of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana </italic>(Col-0) were sterilized in 4% sodium hypochlorite for 5 min and rinsed five times with sterilized water.
