In this study, we hypothesized that the major benefits of simvastatin in pulmonary hypertension occur via the heme oxygenase-1 pathway.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Simvastatin (10 mg/kgw/day) was tested in two rat models of pulmonary hypertension (PH): monocrotaline administration and chronic hypoxia. The hemodynamic changes, right heart hypertrophy, HO-1 protein expression, and heme oxygenase (HO) activity in lungs were measured in both models with and without simvastatin treatment. Tin-protoporphyrin (SnPP, 20 &#x003bc;mol/kg w/day), a potent inhibitor of HO activity, was used to confirm the role of HO-1.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Simvastatin significantly ameliorated pulmonary arterial hypertension from 38.0 &#x000b1; 2.2 mm Hg to 22.1 &#x000b1; 1.9 mm Hg in monocrotaline-induced PH (MCT-PH) and from 33.3 &#x000b1; 0.8 mm Hg to 17.5 &#x000b1; 2.9 mm Hg in chronic hypoxia-induced PH (CH-PH) rats. The severity of right ventricular hypertrophy was significantly reduced by simvastatin in MCT-PH and CH-PH rats. Co-administration with SnPP abolished the benefits of simvastatin. Simvastatin significantly increased HO-1 protein expression and HO activity in the lungs of rats with PH; however co-administration of SnPP reduced HO-1 activity only. These observations indicate that the simvastatin-induced amelioration of pulmonary hypertension was directly related to the activity of HO-1, rather than its expression.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study demonstrated that simvastatin treatment ameliorates established pulmonary hypertension primarily through an HO-1-dependent pathway.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is a rare but life-threatening disease characterized by significant increases in pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) and right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] It is a disease of the small pulmonary arteries that results in a progressive increase in pulmonary vascular resistance and, ultimately, right ventricular failure and death.</p><p>Simvastatin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor, is a statin, agents with well-known lipid-lowering effects that substantially decrease cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in patients with and without coronary artery diseases.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] However, a growing body of evidence has revealed that the therapeutic benefits of statins cannot be explained solely by their inhibitory action on cholesterol synthesis.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] These so-called pleiotropic, cholesterol-independent effects are believed to include anti-proliferative, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant actions. Today, a number of experimental studies suggest the potential of statins as a novel therapy for PH, based on these pleiotropic effects.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] Several experimental studies have investigated the possible mechanisms of simvastatin benefits in models of PH induced by monocrotaline (MCT) or by chronic hypoxia (CH). [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] However, the underlying mechanism of these protective effects of simvastatin in PH remains to be investigated.</p><p>Heme oxygenase (HO) is the rate-limiting enzyme in the oxidation of heme to biliverdin and carbon monoxide (CO). There are three isoenzymes of HO: HO-1, an inducible isoform, and HO-2 and HO-3, which are constitutively synthesized. Induction of the important cytoprotective molecule HO-1 has been shown to have vasodilatory, anti-inflammatory, and pro-apoptotic effects mediated through CO and bilirubin.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] HO-1 expression is upregulated in several pulmonary diseases and can be induced by simvastatin treatment.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] Previous studies have shown that raising endogenous HO-1 levels prevented CH-induced PH (CH-PH), and that HO-1 transgenic mice were protected from the development of PH and vessel wall hypertrophy induced by CH.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] Moreover, HO-1 is a target site of statins in endothelial cells leading to HO-1 promoter activation, transcript and protein accumulation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] Simvastatin activates HO-1 expression through p38 and the phosphoinositide 3-kinase-Akt pathways which mediate its anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative effects in vitro and in vivo.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] Previously, our research group has also demonstrated that simvastatin could protect the liver from ischemia-reperfusion injury by HO-1 induction.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] Therefore, we hypothesized here that simvastatin therapy could ameliorate PH severity in MCT-induced PH (MCT-PH) and CH-PH in the rat, and that HO-1 dependent pathways would be important mechanisms of the protective effects of simvastatin.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Animal Treatments and Groups</title><p>Female Wistar rats weighing between 200 and 250 g were used in our experiments.

The main findings of this study are as follows: (a) simvastatin could ameliorate pulmonary hypertension in MCT-PH or CH-PH rats; (b) both levels and activity of HO-1 were increased in rat lung after simvastatin treatment; (c) the therapeutic effect of simvastatin was abolished by inhibiting HO-1 enzyme activity with SnPP, suggesting that the therapeutic effect of simvastatin is mediated by HO-1. This study demonstrated that HO-1 activity plays a key role in the attenuation of established pulmonary hypertension by simvastatin treatment in PH rats. To our knowledge, this is the first study to show that the decrease in severity of pulmonary hypertension in rat lungs after simvastatin treatment depends on the HO-1 enzyme activity rather than the level of HO-1 protein expression.</p><p>Although numerous researchers prefer to use male animals for PH experiments to avoid any potential influence of female hormones on the study results, we chose female rats in this study for the potential application of simvastatin in clinical use. Current literature describes nearly no male-dominant tendencies in most clinical PH diseases in humans.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] In contrast, the incidence and prevalence of idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and secondary PAH related to connective tissue diseases in human is higher in females than in males. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] We feel, therefore, that experimental results from female rats are both clinically valid and necessary.</p><p>Previous reports have described that the beneficial effects of simvastatin in preventing or reversing established PH were observed over weeks of oral simvastatin administration.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] In our study, significant attenuation of established pulmonary hypertension was seen with treatment times as short as three days, via intraperitoneal injection. Although short duration oral simvastatin treatment may also have the same effects as intraperitoneal injection, at this point in time the short-term effects of oral simvastatin on PH animals have not been examined. One reasonable explanation for the prolonged treatment duration required following oral simvastatin administration was that the absorption and distribution of simvastatin were slower than following intraperitoneal administration. Although this intraperitoneal administration differs from the more normal oral administration used in clinical settings, our results still have valid clinical implications.</p><p>We examined the effects of simvastatin in two well-established PH animal models, MCT- and CH-PH rats. MCT is a pyrrolizidine alkaloid which is activated in the liver and then transfers to the lungs causing pulmonary injury and trauma.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] In previous studies, pulmonary arterial endothelial injury followed by an inflammatory response triggered severe, progressive pulmonary hypertension, as indicated by a dramatic increase in PAP and RVH.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] On the other hand, CH exposure leads to structural changes in the pulmonary arteries, including smooth muscle proliferation and hypertrophy, and produces well-known adaptive PH changes in rat lungs. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] Simvastatin therapy can provide anti-inflammatory, anti-proliferative, and pro-apoptotic effects and has been well demonstrated to prevent or attenuate established PH in several PH rat models. Simvastatin may restore eNOS expression in endothelial cells, and can also attenuate PH and inhibit pulmonary vascular remodelling in CH rats.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] In addition, simvastatin was able to rescue rats from fatal PH by inducing apoptosis of vascular neointimal smooth muscle cells in a pneumonectomy-plus-MCT treatment rat model.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] A recent study indicated that simvastatin may ameliorate CH-PH by the inhibition of ROCK expression and activity.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] However, the exact mechanism by which simvastatin mediates protection against PH has not yet been fully elucidated.</p><p>In the human body, heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) degrades heme to generate carbon monoxide (CO), iron, and biliverdin, which is subsequently converted to bilirubin. HO-1 is considered to be a cytoprotective enzyme because each of these products of heme breakdown plays its own protective role. Recent studies have found that inducible HO-1 regulates vascular tone and cell proliferation through the production of endogenous CO by the degradation of heme.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] CO activates guanylate cyclase, raising cellular cGMP level and resulting in vascular smooth muscle relaxation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] Increasing evidence also suggests a regulatory interaction in vascular smooth muscle cells between CO and NO via HO-1, with HO-1 being regulated by NO during hypoxia.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] Lee et al. demonstrated that the anti-inflammatory and anti-proliferative effects of simvastatin were largely through the simvastatin-induced HO-1 and the potential mechanism activating HO-1 expression may be through p38 and phosphoinositide 3-kinase-Akt pathways.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] Taken together, we suggest that HO-1 may be crucial in the simvastatin effects of attenuating PH.</p><p>There is other accumulating evidence that supports the idea that HO-1 plays an important role in PH.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] Lack of HO-1 expression in HO-1-knockout mice was associated with organized mural thrombi and subsequent PH; HO-1 transgenic mice were protected from the development of vessel wall hypertrophy induced by CH.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] HO-1 may play defensive roles against MCT-induced pulmonary inflammation and cardiac hypertrophy in mice.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>] Enhancement of endogenous HO-1 by NiCl<sub>2 </sub>or hemin could prevent CH-PH.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] Furthermore, previous studies have shown that simvastatin induced HO-1 protein expression in vascular smooth muscle cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] and endothelial cells.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] Microarray analysis revealed that HO-1 was one of the genes with significantly increased expression after simvastatin treatment in CH-PH rats.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] Zhou et al. showed that augmentation of endogenous HO-1 by rapamycin treatment had antiproliferative and vascular protective effects in MCT-PH.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>] These findings indicate that the enhancement of HO-1 provides a therapeutic effect in experimental pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, we proposed that the HO-1 pathway is involved in simvastatin amelioration of pulmonary hypertension. Our results confirm that induction of HO-1 by simvastatin was responsible for attenuating effects on PH and the severity of RVH in MCT- and CH-induced PH rats.</p><p>In order to elucidate the important role of HO-1 in mediating the protective effects of simvastatin, we co-administered simvastatin with tin-protoporphyrin (SnPP), a competitive antagonist of HO, in PH rats.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>] SnPP binds to the catalytic sites of heme oxygenase to block the activity of HO proteins, thus permitting its use as a pharmacological agent for suppressing heme catabolism in animal models.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>] Administration of simvastatin with SnPP significantly decreased HO activity and thus successfully abolished the therapeutic effects of simvastatin in PH rats. Because HO-2 expression is constitutive and only HO-1 expression is inducible, it appears that simvastatin-induced HO-1 protein expression is likely the main contributor to the change of HO activity. Zhou et al. demonstrated a similar effect of co-treatment with SnPP on rapamycin-induced HO-1-mediated antiproliferative effects in vascular disease.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>] Interestingly, although SnPP administration in PH rats in the present study had no beneficial effect on pulmonary hypertension, the presence of SnPP still significantly increased HO-1 protein expression compared with that of untreated PH rats. This phenomenon may be resulted from the dual mechanism whereby SnPP regulates heme oxygenase &#x02013; potently inhibiting the enzyme at the catalytic site by acting as a competitive substrate for heme while enhancing the synthesis of new enzyme protein[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. Sardana et al. also demonstrated that HO-1 levels increased strongly in rat liver after SnPP application while HO-1 activity was significantly inhibited.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>] Based on these findings, we hypothesize that HO-1 activity rather than HO-1 protein over-expression is the key factor underlying the beneficial effects of simvastatin treatment in MCT- and CH-PH.</p><p>There were several limitations of this study. First, the mechanism responsible for human PH remains to be elucidated and our two animal models only partially mimic the pathologic changes which occur in these conditions. Therefore, it remains unclear whether the clinical benefits of simvastatin in PH will be consistent with our results in these animal models. Second, while we used a simvastatin dose (10 mg/kgw) over a short duration (once daily treatment for 3 days) which did effectively reduce the PAP in PH rats, determination of the best dose and frequency of simvastatin treatment in clinical applications requires further investigation. Third, while we did not evaluate the effect of simvastatin on pulmonary vascular remodelling in PH rats because we did not anticipate any significant change to the pulmonary vasculature in this short duration of simvastatin treatment, this also remains untested.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study demonstrated that simvastatin could attenuate the severity of established PH in both MCT- and CH-PH rat models and that the mechanism underlying this beneficial effect is mediated by HO-1 activity rather than expression.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>HHH conceived the study, analysis, interpretation and drafted the manuscript.
