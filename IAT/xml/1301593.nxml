However, the detailed mechanism of gene regulation by ERR&#x003b3; is not fully understood. In this study we have found that the orphan nuclear receptor ERR&#x003b3; activates the <italic>DAX-1</italic> promoter, which, in turn, represses transactivation by ERR&#x003b3;. Serial deletions of mouse <italic>DAX-1</italic> (mDAX-1) gene promoter have revealed that the region responding to ERR&#x003b3; is located between &#x02212;129 and &#x02212;121 bp and &#x02212;334 and &#x02212;326 bp. Gel shift assays and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays demonstrated that ERR&#x003b3; binds directly to the m<italic>DAX-1</italic> promoter. Site-directed mutagenesis results demonstrated that ERRE1 (&#x02212;129 to &#x02212;121 bp) is more important than ERRE2 (&#x02212;334 to &#x02212;326 bp) which is not conserved in the human <italic>DAX-1</italic> promoter. In addition, adenovirus-mediated overexpression of ERR&#x003b3; induced <italic>DAX-1</italic> gene expression in MCF-7 breast cancer cells that co-expressed ERR&#x003b3; and DAX-1. Moreover, yeast two-hybrid and glutathione <italic>S</italic>-transferase (GST)-pull down assays demonstrated that DAX-1 physically interacted with ERR&#x003b3; and inhibited ERR&#x003b3; transactivation, and that this interaction was dependent on the AF-2 domain of ERR&#x003b3;. In addition, <italic>in vitro</italic> competition assays showed that DAX-1 inhibited PGC-1&#x003b1; mediated ERR&#x003b3; transactivation, via competition between these two factors for the AF-2 binding domain. We thus propose a novel autoregulatory loop that controls <italic>DAX-1</italic> gene expression by ERR&#x003b3;.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Nuclear receptors (NRs) are ligand-dependent transcription factors that bind to specific DNA target sequences through their highly conserved DNA-binding domain (DBD) and activate transcription through interaction with coactivators. The latter property is dependent on their moderately conserved ligand-binding domain (LBD) and in particular requires the extreme C-terminal part of it, the so-called AF-2 region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>).</p><p>Among NRs, DAX-1 (dosage-sensitive sex reversal, adrenal hypoplasia critical region, on chromosome X, gene 1) (NR0B1) is an atypical orphan nuclear receptor, since it does not contain a DBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>). Instead, the N-terminal half of DAX-1 contains a unique region mainly composed of three repeats, each of which is 65&#x02013;67 amino acids in length. This region contains LXXLL motif-like sequences (where <italic>L</italic> and <italic>M</italic> are leucine and methionine, respectively, and X can be any amino acid) that are necessary for interaction with estrogen receptors (ERs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>). Since the C-terminal half of DAX-1 containing the putative LBD functions as a repressor domain through interaction with corepressors (NCoR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>), two mechanisms have been proposed to function cooperatively in the repression of transcription exerted by DAX-1. According to the proposition, DAX-1 would both block the binding of coactivators to NRs and recruit corepressors with its C-terminal half (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>). The <italic>DAX-1</italic> gene was identified through a search for a gene linked to adrenal hypoplasia congenita, a disease affecting the normal development of the adrenal cortex and which is often associated with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>). Mouse and human <italic>DAX-1</italic> promoters have been cloned and characterized. For example, orphan nuclear receptor steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1) regulates <italic>DAX-1</italic> promoter, and the SF-1 response element is located between &#x02212;129 and &#x02212;121 bp on the mouse promoter and between &#x02212;135 and &#x02212;143 bp on the human promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>).</p><p>Estrogen-related receptors (ERRs-alpha, -beta and -gamma), are orphan NRs closely related to ERs, with which they share identical target response elements and coregulatory proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). However, ERRs do not respond to the classical ER ligand. Previous studies have demonstrated that <italic>MCAD</italic>, <italic>pS2</italic> and <italic>cyp19</italic> are targets of ERR&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>). Among the ERR family, ERR&#x003b3;, the newest member of the subfamily, is a constitutively active nuclear receptor, and little is known about its <italic>in vivo</italic> functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). Previous studies have demonstrated that 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT) directly binds to and deactivates ERR&#x003b3;, suggesting that 4-OHT is an inverse agonist of ERR&#x003b3; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). However, the deactivation mechanism of ERR&#x003b3; by 4-OHT requires further elucidation. It has been reported that coactivators such as GRIP1 or PGC-1&#x003b1;, interact directly with ERR&#x003b3; and activate its transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>). ERR&#x003b3; acts as a monomer and activates transcription constitutively. It has also been suggested in recent reports, that ERR&#x003b3; forms dimers through its LBD. In contrast to this, the related receptor, ERR&#x003b1;, inhibits the activities of both ERR&#x003b1; and ERR&#x003b3; through heterodimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). ERR&#x003b3; exhibits significant affinities for binding to a wide spectrum of sequences, including inverted and direct repeat sequences composed of AGGTCA half-sites with differing spacings, as well as a monovalent motif of the same sequence carrying an extra T(C/G)A trinucleotide on the 5&#x02032; side (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). It has been reported that ERR&#x003b3; binds to and transactivates both estrogen response elements and SF-1 response elements (SF-1RE). Previous reports have suggested that several monomeric binding partners, such as SF-1, liver receptor homolog-1 (LRH-1) and ERR&#x003b3;, can activate and bind directly to the small heterodimer partner (SHP) promoter through SF-1RE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>).</p><p>DAX-1 is closely related to SHP, which neither contains a DNA-binding domain nor functions as a corepressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>). In addition, both the <italic>DAX-1</italic> and <italic>SHP</italic> promoters are regulated by the monomer binding partner SF-1. Thus, since the <italic>DAX-1</italic> promoter contains several SF-1RE, we predicted that ERR&#x003b3; could also activate the <italic>DAX-1</italic> promoter. Transient transfection studies demonstrated that ERR&#x003b3; had a preferential effect on the <italic>DAX-1</italic> promoter. The results of deletion and site-directed mutagenesis have revealed that two ERR regulatory elements (ERREs) are responsible for the ERR&#x003b3;-mediated activation of the <italic>DAX-1</italic> promoter. The results of electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays strongly suggest that ERR&#x003b3; binds directly to the <italic>DAX-1</italic> promoter. In addition, the results of overexpression and ERR&#x003b3; knock-down experiments demonstrated that ERR&#x003b3; regulates <italic>DAX-1</italic> gene expression in MCF-7 breast cancer cells and that ERR&#x003b3; and DAX-1 are co-expressed in breast cancer tissue. The expression of DAX-1 inhibits ERR&#x003b3; transactivation of its own promoter and DAX-1 competes directly with the coactivator, PGC-1&#x003b1;, for binding to ERR&#x003b3;. Taken together, these results suggest that ERR&#x003b3; belongs to a new autoregulatory loop that governs <italic>DAX-1</italic> gene expression.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plasmids and DNA construction</title><p>pcDNA3/HA-ERR&#x003b1;, &#x003b2;, and &#x003b3; (&#x00394;AF-2), pcDNA3/HA SF-1, pcDNA3/HA DAX-1, pcDNA3/HA PGC-1&#x003b1;, pGEX4T-1 DAX-1, B42 ERR&#x003b3;, B42 &#x00394;AF-2 ERR&#x003b3;, Lex A DAX-1, and pcDNA3 PGC-1&#x003b1; were described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>).

Bacterially expressed GST only and GST fused ERR&#x003b3; were purified using GST-Sepharose beads (Amersham Bioscience, Inc.). Gel mobility shift assays (20 &#x000b5;l) contained 10 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 40 mM KCl, 0.05% Nonidet P-40, 6% glycerol, 1 mM DTT, and 1 &#x000b5;g of poly (dI-dC).

In brief, the cDNA encoding ERR&#x003b3; was cloned into a pAd-YC2 shuttle vector, which (under the control of the cytomegalovirus promoter) contains a bovine growth hormone polyadenylation signal sequence. For homologous recombination, a pAd-YC2 shuttle vector (5 &#x000b5;g) and a rescue vector, pJM17 (5 &#x000b5;g), were co-transfected into human embryonic kidney 293 cells. To purify pure plaques, cell culture supernatant was serially diluted into serum-free media and incubated with 293 cells at 37&#x000b0;C for 1 h. An equal volume mixture of 2&#x000d7; medium and 1% agarose was overlaid on the 293 cells. After 7 days, plaques that were well isolated were purified further and propagated in 293 cells and screened by PCR, using upstream primers derived from the cytomegalovirus promoter, and downstream primers from the bovine growth hormone polyadenylation sequence. Then, the recombinants were amplified in 293 cells and were purified and isolated using CsCl<sub>2</sub> (Sigma). The preparations were collected and desalted, and titers were determined by counting the number of plaques.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>Immunohistochemical analysis was performed with nine human breast cancer tissues.

In order to investigate the sequences that were required for ERR&#x003b3; mediated activation, a series of 5&#x02032; deletions of the <italic>DAX-1</italic> promoter were constructed, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>. Since the <italic>DAX-1</italic> promoter contains two ERREs, we designed deletion constructs both with and without an ERRE. Activation by ERR&#x003b3; was decreased when the <italic>DAX-1</italic> promoter was deleted up to &#x02212;325 bp, as demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>. Furthermore, the activation of the <italic>DAX-1</italic> promoter by ERR&#x003b3;, was almost lost with the &#x02212;121 bp <italic>DAX-1</italic> construct. These results suggest that ERREs are required for ERR&#x003b3; response.</p></sec><sec><title>Determination of ERR&#x003b3; binding regions</title><p>In order to clarify the specific binding of ERR&#x003b3; to ERREs, gel mobility shift assays were performed. As demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, we designed both wild-type and mutant probes that corresponded to ERRE1 and ERRE2. Previously, the TNAAGGTCA sequence was shown to be a bona fide ERRE. Within the sequence, the GG dimer is pivotal for ERR&#x003b3; protein binding. Thus, we substituted GG for the TT sequence. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> demonstrates that ERR&#x003b3; formed specific complexes with ERRE1 and ERRE2; a 50- or 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled ERRE1 and ERRE2 competed strongly with the DNA&#x02013;protein complex. In order to verify that ERR&#x003b3; binds to the <italic>DAX-1</italic> promoter <italic>in vivo</italic>, we performed a ChIP assay using PCR primers that flanked both ERRE1 and ERRE2 (&#x02212;350 to &#x02212;100 bp). 293T cells were transfected with the <italic>DAX-1</italic> promoter, either with hemagglutinin (HA) only or with HA-tagged ERR&#x003b3;. As demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, a 250 bp PCR product (&#x02212;350 to &#x02212;100 bp) was observed in cells that were transfected with the expression vector for HA-ERR&#x003b3; but not with the vector expressing only the HA epitope. This indicated that HA-ERR&#x003b3; formed a specific complex with the <italic>DAX-1</italic> promoter <italic>in vivo</italic>. Taken together, this suggests that ERR&#x003b3; regulates the <italic>DAX-1</italic> promoter by direct binding to ERRE.</p></sec><sec><title>ERRE1 (&#x02212;129 to &#x02212;121 bp) is essential for transactivation of the <italic>DAX-1</italic> promoter by ERR&#x003b3;</title><p>In order to verify the functional significance of ERR&#x003b3; binding sites in the <italic>DAX-1</italic> promoter, site-directed mutagenesis was performed on the &#x02212;467 bp <italic>DAX-1</italic> promoter using the primers as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>. Wild-type &#x02212;467 bp/Luc and several mutant constructs were transiently transfected with ERR&#x003b3; into 293T cells. The ERRE1 mutation (mtERRE1/Luc) and double ERRE1 and ERRE2 mutations (mtERRE1&#x00026;2/Luc) completely abolished the ERR&#x003b3;-mediated transactivation of the <italic>DAX-1</italic> promoter whereas the ERRE2 mutation (mtERRE2/Luc) had a slight effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). These results indicated that ERRE1, rather than ERRE2, was essential for the activation of the <italic>DAX-1</italic> promoter by ERR&#x003b3;. Thus, we conclude that ERRE1 plays a major role in the activation of the <italic>DAX-1</italic> promoter by ERR&#x003b3;.</p></sec><sec><title>Induction of <italic>DAX-1</italic> gene expression by ERR&#x003b3; in breast cancer</title><p>Previous reports have demonstrated that ERR&#x003b3; is a favorable biomarker and, possibly, an indicator of hormonal sensitivity in breast cancer. In addition, DAX-1 has also been detected in breast cancer tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>). In order to investigate whether ERR&#x003b3; can directly regulate <italic>DAX-1</italic> gene expression in breast cancer cells, we introduced ERR&#x003b3; by adenovirus infection into MCF-7 cells. As demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, a basal expression of DAX-1 and ERR&#x003b3; was detected in MCF-7 cells, and DAX-1 mRNA was induced by overexpression of Ad-ERR&#x003b3; 24 h after infection. Since ERR&#x003b3; is basally expressed in MCF-7 cells, we further tested whether <italic>DAX-1</italic> gene expression is down-regulated by performing knock-down of endogenous ERR&#x003b3; expression using small interfering RNA (si-ERR&#x003b3;/I or II) in MCF-7 cells. si-ERR&#x003b3;/I, but not si-ERR&#x003b3;/II significantly reduced endogenous ERR&#x003b3; expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). <italic>DAX-1</italic> mRNA level was decreased by knock-down of ERR&#x003b3; by si-ERR&#x003b3;/I, but not by si-ERR&#x003b3;/II, suggesting that endogenous ERR&#x003b3; can activate <italic>DAX-1</italic> expression. In addition, CHIP assays were performed to confirm the direct binding of ERR&#x003b3; to the endogenous <italic>DAX-1</italic> promoter in MCF-7 cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, ERR&#x003b3; can bind to the <italic>DAX-1</italic> promoter in MCF-7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Next, we analyzed for co-expression of DAX-1 and ERR&#x003b3; in human breast cancer tissues, using immunohistochemistry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Nuclear immunoreactivity of DAX-1 was detected in breast cancer tissues. The overexpression of ERR&#x003b3; was observed in three out of nine cases. All of the ERR&#x003b3;-positive cancers co-expressed the DAX-1 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, upper part). Two cancer tissues that were DAX-1-negative were also negative for ERR&#x003b3;. No staining was observed in the negative controls using either pre-immune rabbit serum or by omitting the primary antibody (data not shown). These results suggest that ERR&#x003b3; can stimulate <italic>DAX-1</italic> gene expression in human breast cancer cells.</p></sec><sec><title>DAX-1 represses ERR&#x003b3; transactivation of its own promoter</title><p>DAX-1 interacts with several orphan NRs (ER, AR, LRH-1, SF-1 and Nur77) and represses their transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>). We investigated whether DAX-1 can also repress ERR&#x003b3; mediated transactivation of its own promoter. The results of transient transfections demonstrated that DAX-1 inhibits ERR&#x003b3; activity of the <italic>DAX-1</italic> promoter in a dose-dependant manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Since ERR&#x003b3; also activates the <italic>SHP</italic> promoter, and SHP represses ERR&#x003b3; transactivation of its own promoter, we examined whether DAX-1 represses the ERR&#x003b3;-mediated transactivation of the <italic>SHP</italic> promoter or <italic>vice versa.</italic> As demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and C</xref>, DAX-1 and SHP repressed ERR&#x003b3; transactivation of both the <italic>SHP</italic> promoter and the <italic>DAX-1</italic> promoter. These results suggest that both <italic>DAX-1</italic> and <italic>SHP</italic> are regulated by ERR&#x003b3; and repress the transcriptional activity of ERR&#x003b3; through an autoregulatory loop. Since <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> shows that DAX-1 repressed the transcriptional activity of ERR&#x003b3;, we examined whether DAX-1 can directly interact with ERR&#x003b3;, by using a GST-pull down and yeast two-hybrid interaction assays. As demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A and B</xref>, DAX-1 interacted with ERR&#x003b3;. Since repression or activation is dependant on the AF-2 domain, we deleted this domain in ERR&#x003b3;. As expected, DAX-1 could not interact with ERR&#x003b3; &#x00394;AF-2, which demonstrates that the AF-2 domain of ERR&#x003b3; is crucial for the repressive effect of DAX-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). In the case of DAX-1, an LBD-like region was involved in the interaction with ERR&#x003b3; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). These results suggest that DAX-1 interacts directly with the AF-2 surface of ERR&#x003b3;.</p><p>Since the AF-2 surface of ERR&#x003b3; is involved in the interaction with DAX-1, we explored the role of coactivator competition in the repression of ERR&#x003b3; activity. As demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>, PGC-1&#x003b1;, which was described previously as a coactivator of ERR&#x003b3;, significantly increased the activity of ERR&#x003b3; on the <italic>DAX-1</italic> promoter and the co-expression of DAX-1 with PGC-1&#x003b1; repressed this induction in a dose-dependant manner. This result suggests that both PGC-1&#x003b1; and DAX-1 compete for the binding of the AF-2 pocket of ERR&#x003b3;, as demonstrated for other receptors. In order to confirm the direct competition between DAX-1 and PGC-1&#x003b1; for binding to ERR&#x003b3;, we performed <italic>in vitro</italic> competition binding assays, using PGC-1&#x003b1; and DAX-1 with GST fused ERR&#x003b3;. The results of this study confirmed the findings of a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>). Specifically, <sup>35</sup>S-labeled PGC-1&#x003b1; interacted with ERR&#x003b3;, and DAX-1 inhibited the interaction between PGC-1&#x003b1; and ERR&#x003b3; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). In addition, no interaction between DAX-1 and PGC-1&#x003b1; occurred. Taken together, these observations suggest that DAX-1 physically inhibits the transcriptional activity of ERR&#x003b3; by competing with PGC-1&#x003b1; for interaction with ERR&#x003b3;.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>ERR&#x003b3; is one of the newest members of the orphan nuclear receptor family. Therefore, the target and molecular mechanisms of ERR&#x003b3; have not yet been clearly identified. In this study, we demonstrated that ERR&#x003b3; acts as a potential regulator of <italic>DAX-1</italic>, which, in turn represses ERR&#x003b3; at a molecular level. This suggests the existence of an autoregulatory loop.</p><p>Although the physiological role of DAX-1 has been clearly identified, regulation of the <italic>DAX-1</italic> promoter is not fully understood. A previous report demonstrated that SF-1 regulates the <italic>DAX-1</italic> promoter through SFRE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>). Even though several SFREs are located on the <italic>DAX-1</italic> promoter, the functional property of SFRE on the <italic>DAX-1</italic> promoter has been characterized only in the region between &#x02212;129 and &#x02212;121 bp, which is conserved in both mouse and human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). As demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, ERRE1 is identical to sequences previously identified as the SFRE. We also characterized a new ERRE2 that was not previously identified as an SF-1RE. Although both ERRE1 and ERRE2 are required for the binding of ERR&#x003b3;, the data from mutation analysis suggest that ERRE1 is more responsible for ERR&#x003b3; transactivation than ERRE2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). In the human <italic>DAX-1</italic> promoter, only ERRE1 is present. However, SF-1 can still activate the <italic>DAX-1</italic> promoter. This demonstrates that ERRE1 is critical for transactivarion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). Although all three members (&#x003b1;, &#x003b2; and &#x003b3;) of the ERR family bound to the same DNA response element (data not shown), only ERR&#x003b3; was able to activate the <italic>DAX-1</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). This suggests that DNA-binding is not completely responsible for transactivation.</p><p>The basal transcriptional activity of ERR&#x003b1; and &#x003b2; is relatively low compared to the high activity of ERR&#x003b3;. This suggests that the basal transcriptional mechanism governing ERR&#x003b1; and &#x003b2; may be distinct from that of ERR&#x003b3;. A previous report demonstrated that ERR&#x003b3; is constitutively active, because ERR&#x003b3; forms a complex with coactivators, such as SRC-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>). It has been suggested that, depending on the specific co-regulator recruitment, transcriptional activity can be very different. Furthermore, since NRs can differentially modulate target promoters through the recruitment of different coregulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>), ERR&#x003b3; may regulate target promoters, such as <italic>DAX-1</italic>, in a distinctly unique manner, compared to ERR&#x003b1; and &#x003b2;. Further investigation is necessary to determine whether ERR&#x003b3; regulation of target promoters differs with co-regulator recruitment.</p><p>Until recently, the ligand for ERR&#x003b3; was unknown, although 4-OHT was reported to be an inverse agonist of ERR&#x003b3; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). Despite a recent report demonstrating that phenolic acyl hydrazone is a selective agonist of ERR&#x003b2; and ERR&#x003b3;, further study will be required to prove that phenolic acyl hydrazone is a bona fide activator of ERR&#x003b2; and &#x003b3; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>). 4-OHT is widely used in the treatment of breast cancer and deactivates ERR&#x003b3; which was proposed as a favorable biomarker in human breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>). As demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, both ERR&#x003b3; and DAX-1 are expressed in breast cancer cells and tissues. Furthermore, ERR&#x003b3; regulated the gene expression of <italic>DAX-1</italic> in a positive manner, demonstrating that the <italic>DAX-1</italic> promoter is a potential target of ERR&#x003b3; <italic>in vivo</italic>. Although the function of ERR&#x003b3; and DAX-1 in breast cancer is not completely understood, we speculate that there is both a positive and negative relationship between DAX-1 and ERR&#x003b3;, since DAX-1 acts as both a corepressor of ER and ERR&#x003b3; and as a regulator of the <italic>DAX-1</italic> promoter. Recent reports indicated that ERR&#x003b3; regulates the ERR&#x003b1; promoter via a conserved hormone response element and epidermal growth factor signaling which affects ERR&#x003b1; transactivation in breast cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>). Since ERR&#x003b1;, ERR&#x003b3; and PGC-1&#x003b1; are co-expressed in breast cancer, their physiological function may be significantly correlated in breast cancer tissues.</p><p>It has been reported that DAX-1 interacts directly with various NRs and represses their transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>). Previous studies have demonstrated that DAX-1 uses its N-terminal repeating region, defined as the LXXLL-containing interaction domain, for interaction with NRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>). In this study, we demonstrated that the LBD-like region of DAX-1 interacts with ERR&#x003b3;. We also found that DAX-1 interacts with ERR&#x003b1; and &#x003b2; (data not shown). The AF-2 domain of ERR&#x003b3; was crucial for the interaction with DAX-1 and acted as a binding surface for competition with the coactivator PGC-1&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Depending on the binding region of the nuclear receptor with the corepressor, the repressive mechanism of the corepressor can be quite different. When the DBD of the nuclear receptor is involved in interaction with the corepressor, the DNA-binding of the nuclear receptor is blocked by the corepressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>). Inversely, if the AF-2 domain of the nuclear receptor interacts with the corepressor, the competition between coactivators and the corepressor occurs on the AF-2 surface of the nuclear receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>). In the case of ERR&#x003b3;, the AF-2 domain interacts with DAX-1 and acts as a binding surface for interaction with the coactivator PGC-1&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><p>Previously, we reported that the <italic>SHP</italic> promoter is a target of ERR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>). In the current study, we suggest that DAX-1 is a target of ERR&#x003b3;. As demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, DAX-1 repressed the transcriptional activity of ERR&#x003b3; on the <italic>DAX-1</italic> and <italic>SHP</italic> promoters. In addition, SHP also inhibited ERR&#x003b3; on the <italic>DAX-1</italic> and <italic>SHP</italic> promoters. It is very interesting that ERR&#x003b3; regulates corepressor proteins, such DAX-1 and SHP, which act as repression modulators. Although both SHP and DAX-1 are involved in the regulation of the corepressor-mediated transactivation of NRs, their physiological functions are quite different from each other. While DAX-1 plays a role in steroidogenic tissues, SHP functions mainly in the liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>). We demonstrated that there is a correlation between ERR&#x003b3; and DAX-1 in breast cancer cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). In the case of SHP, we confirmed using adenovirus that ERR&#x003b3; activated <italic>SHP</italic> gene expression in the pancreas, but not in the liver (data not shown). This demonstrated that tissue-specific target gene expression is modulated by ERR&#x003b3;. DAX-1 is also differentially regulated by ERR&#x003b3;, depending on the target tissue. The modulation of DAX-1 and SHP by ERR&#x003b3; <italic>in vivo</italic> needs to be examined further, in order to identify the physiological roles of ERR&#x003b3;, SHP and DAX-1.</p><p>Collectively, as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>, we hypothesize that ERR&#x003b3; activates the <italic>DAX-1</italic> promoter, which in turn inhibits ERR&#x003b3; through coactivator competition. In this study, we demonstrated that <italic>DAX-1</italic> is a potential target of ERR&#x003b3;. Our study provides a new insight into understanding the basic mechanisms of DAX-1 and ERR&#x003b3;, and is expected to provide clues for the identification of the functions of ERR&#x003b3;.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by a National Research Laboratory grant (M1-0500-4705J-4710), a KRF grant (C00126) and a Marine Bio21 grant.
