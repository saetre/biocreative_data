However, these models cannot determine if increased ICOS surface expression is contributing to disease progression or alternatively, if it is a result of augmented T cell activation.</p><p>To definitively demonstrate whether differences in ICOS cell-surface expression alone can have global effects on a Th2 immune response, we have used a mouse model in which the experimental group had its ICOS surface expression fixed at a lower level than wild-type T cells. We find that ICOS<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> T cells have decreased ICOS surface expression compared to ICOS<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> T cells although activation status was equal, and therefore we used ICOS<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> and ICOS<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> mice to test our hypothesis that genetically decreasing ICOS surface expression levels could directly result in diminished Th2 response.

However, these mice did not have reduced numbers of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD44<sup>high</sup>CD62L<sup>low</sup> effector cells (20.75&#x00025;&#x000b1;1.1 vs. 21.22&#x00025;&#x000b1;2.4). Indicating the difference in Th2 cells in ICOS<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> mice is not due to decreased T cell activation. There was no significant difference in the number of GFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells in the spleens of ICOS<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> and ICOS<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007525-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>) indicating that the difference observed was localized to the site of the immune response.</p><p>An alternate explanation for the decreased Th2 cytokine production upon ex vivo restimulation is that ICOS<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> T cells have decreased number of IL-4 transcripts on a per cell basis. To determine if ICOS<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> Th2 cells also have decreased IL-4 transcription on a per cell basis, we compared the GFP MFI of the CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>GFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells between the two groups. ICOS<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> and ICOS<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> T cells in both the BAL and mediastinal lymph nodes have similar GFP MFI (data not shown).</p><p>To confirm the notion that equal ICOS<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> GFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and ICOS<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> GFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells have similar capacity to produce IL-4, we sorted CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>GFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>GFP<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cells from the lungs and mediastinal lymph nodes of ICOS<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> and ICOS<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> 4get mice at the peak of inflammation, equalized their numbers and restimulated them with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 to analyze their IL-4 production. In contrast to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007525-g003">Figure 3</xref> where we stimulated all whole lung and mediastinal lymph nodes, when we normalized the number of cells, ICOS<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> T cells did not have reduced IL-4 production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007525-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). Therefore, our data suggests that the decreased lung inflammatory response observed in the ICOS<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> mice is due to reduced number of Th2 cells and not in the ability of those Th2 cells to produce cytokines.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>Multiple studies have shown that ICOS is important for Th2 immune responses and cytokine production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007525-Dong1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007525-Tafuri1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. The majority of these studies compare ICOS<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> and ICOS<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, but to date only a small number of ICOS-deficient patients have been identified <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007525-Grimbacher1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. Our novel study comparing the immune responses between ICOS<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> and ICOS<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> mice bears broader physiological relevance to human diseases in which variances in ICOS expression levels have been found. Tafuri et al. demonstrated that ICOS<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> mice have decreased serum antibodies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007525-Tafuri1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, but did not explore the influence of T cell ICOS surface expression on tissue inflammation. Our data adds to the study by Tafuri et al. and demonstrates that the decreased ICOS cell-surface expression leads to decreased lung eosinophilia, numbers of Th2 cells, and Th2 cytokine production. To our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating that reducing the expression of a single costimulatory molecule alone (versus total deletion) can have a significant effect on a tissue-specific Th2 immune response without influencing T cell activation. Yagi et al. showed that ICOS expression varies between numerous murine strains and there is a positive correlation between ICOS expression and IL-4 production across strains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007525-Yagi1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. However, there are numerous genetic differences between the strains that may influence both ICOS expression and Th2 differentiation. In this report we have minimized the background genetic differences outside of ICOS surface expression by using littermate ICOS<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> and ICOS<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> mice; thus any defects observed are due to differences in this specific costimulatory pathway and not background genetic differences.</p><p>To explore how the level of ICOS-B7RP-1 interactions can regulate Th2 responses, we used a model in which ICOS cell-surface expression levels are pre-determined and compared the responses of ICOS<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> mice and ICOS<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> mice in an established airway inflammation model. We demonstrate that ICOS<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> mice had less surface ICOS expression on CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells than ICOS<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> T cells. The reduction in ICOS surface expression did not alter global T cell activation but had a substantial influence on Th2 immune responses <italic>in vivo</italic>. The ICOS<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> mice had decreased cellular infiltrates in the airways, decreased airway eosinophilia, decreased serum IgE, and defective Th2 cytokine production upon in vitro restimulation of T cells from the lungs and draining lymph nodes. These results show the reduced ICOS surface expression observed in the ICOS<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> mice leads to defective Th2 immune responses. Since both IL-5 and IL-13 are classical Th2 cytokines and potent activators of eosinophil differentiation and recruitment, the decrease in these cytokines likely contributes to the decrease in airway eosinophilia observed in the ICOS<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. By using this model we are able to demonstrate that reduction in ICOS expression on the surface of T cells resulted in reduced Th2 responses <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>ICOS expression also regulates B7RP-1 expression in addition to Th2 cytokine responses. We observed that B6 dendritic cells and B cells have decreased B7RP-1 surface expression compared to ICOS<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> DCs in both untreated and inflamed mice; hence, providing new insight into the ability of T cells to regulate dendritic cells. Interestingly, the B7RP-1 expression on ICOS<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> APCs is slightly augmented but similar to ICOS<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> APCs and is greatly reduced compared to ICOS<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> APCs. Thus we believe the decreased Th2 response observed in ICOS<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> mice is not due to differences in B7RP-1 expression. It is often discussed how na&#x000ef;ve T cells need to interact with dendritic cells in the periphery to survive via interactions between the TCR and MHC. However, my data suggests that the T cell/dendritic cell interaction can also influence the dendritic cells and the presence or absence of ICOS can change the status of the resident DCs. Therefore, these data provide unique insights into the communication between T cells and dendritic cells.</p><p>We utilized the 4get mice that express GFP upon IL-4 transcription to determine at what stage during the immune response that decreased cell surface ICOS expression by ICOS<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> T cells lead to decreased Th2 responses. The ICOS<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> mice had fewer CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> GFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells in both the airways and mediastinal lymph nodes, but when the number of GFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells isolated from ICOS<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> and ICOS<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> mice were equalized, the cells produced similar amounts of IL-4. These data indicate that if an ICOS<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> T cell becomes a Th2 cell it can transcribe IL-4 as well as an ICOS<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> Th2 cell. However, there are fewer Th2 cells in the ICOS<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> mice compared to ICOS<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> mice indicating that ICOS cell-surface expression levels regulate Th2 differentiation <italic>in vivo</italic>. Previous reports have demonstrated that 4get T cells with increased GFP expression also have increased IL-4 protein expression as indicated by intracellular staining <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007525-Mohrs1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, it is reasonable to presume that the ICOS<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup>.4get and ICOS<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup>.4get T cells that are GFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> have similar IL-4 producing capabilities. From our data, we conclude that ICOS<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> mice have a decreased effector response due to decreased number of Th2 cells but not a defect in the cytokine production of effector T cells.</p><p>The human genome project demonstrated that the majority of the differences among humans were due to SNPs in the genome, and less than 1&#x00025; of the SNPs are predicted to result in a mutation in protein function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007525-Venter1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. It is likely that SNPs in the regulatory regions of genes will influence protein expression and this difference in protein expression will have a dramatic impact on the individual. In our model there is a 50&#x00025; reduction in ICOS surface expression on the T cells of ICOS<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. This difference results in a 50&#x00025; reduction in the number of Th2 cells in the BAL and a significant reduction in the percentage of Th2 cells in the mediastinal lymph nodes. This difference in Th2 cells may have greater consequences. For example, previous reports have indicated that IL-4 can upregulate eotaxin expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007525-Rothenberg1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007525-Hoeck1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>, which will recruit eosinophils into the lung. Thus, a reduction in the number of Th2 cells in the lungs leads to a decreased number of eosinophils that arrive in the lung. These eosinophils can augment the existing Th2 response by secreting their own IL-4. Similar to other reports, we observed that the eosinophils in the BAL in the 4get mice are greater than 95&#x00025; GFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> (data not shown, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007525-Chen1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>). Remarkably, this large difference in eosinophils and Th2 cytokine production all results from a small difference in ICOS surface expression.</p><p>Interestingly, the defect in the number of Th2 cells in ICOS<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> was only observed at the site of the immune response as there were equal numbers of CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> GFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells in the spleens of ICOS<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> and ICOS<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. We are currently investigating whether, in addition to their defect in Th2 differentiation, ICOS<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> mice also have a defect in Th2 migration that may also contribute to the reduced number of CD4&#x0002b; GFP&#x0002b; cells observed in the airways of ICOS<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. It has previously been demonstrated that IL-4 can contribute to the induction of the Th2 chemokine, CCL17, in both human and murine lung epithelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007525-Monick1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007525-Terada1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, the defect in Th2 differentiation in ICOS<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> mice may also result in decreased chemotaxis of existing Th2 cells to the site of inflammation.</p><p>We recently published that in humans an <italic>ICOS</italic> promoter region single nucleotide polymorphism is associated with allergy and increased serum IgE in a founder population <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007525-Shilling1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. The SNP also correlates with increased ICOS surface expression and increased Th2 cytokine production from peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The data in this report provides a possible functional explanation for the findings in Shilling et al. and suggests that a genetic predisposition to express higher ICOS levels is a marker for an augmented Th2 inflammatory response, and this augmented response may lead to Th2-mediated diseases such as atopy. A recent report identified a novel ICOS repressor named Roquin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007525-Vinuesa1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. The <italic>sanroque</italic> mice, which lack Roquin resulting in augmented ICOS cell-surface expression, acquire a lupus like phenotype characterized by increased dsDNA antibodies, increased serum IgG and IgE and splenomegaly. Thus, in both mice and humans, the level of ICOS surface expression regulates the magnitude of the <italic>in vivo</italic> Th2 response, perhaps by influencing Th2 differentiation. Furthermore, genetic predisposition to express higher levels of costimulatory molecules may result in differences in likelihood of developing Th2-type diseases.</p><p>Since there is a correlation between ICOS surface expression and in vivo responses, ICOS blockade may be a possible therapeutic target to inhibit diseases initiated by immune hyperresponsiveness. A critical component of rheumatoid arthritis, lupus and myasthemia gravis is the production of anti-self antibodies. Because ICOS costimulation is associated with enhanced B cell isotype switching, blockade of the ICOS/B7RP-1 protein may effectively inhibit the production of harmful anti-self antibodies and reduce disease severity. These data indicate that partially blocking ICOS-B7RP-1 interactions may be an effective therapy for this and other chronic diseases. The partial blockade of this pathway during a hyperactive Th2 immune response may reduce Th2 cytokine production without completely debilitating the immune response, allowing the immune system to maintain a normal immune response against pathogens.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to acknowledge Chen Dong and Richard Flavell for providing the ICOS<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice.
