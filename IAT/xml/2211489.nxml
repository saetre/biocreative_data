In humans formation of gonadal compartments (cords in testis, nests in ovary) takes place during the 1st trimester (6&#x02013;8 weeks gestation). In the 2nd trimester germ cells can enter meiotic prophase in females whereas in males this does not occur until puberty. We have used qRTPCR, Westerns and immunohistochemical profiling to determine which of the germ cell subtypes in the human fetal gonads express OCT4, DAZL and VASA, as these have been shown to play an essential role in germ cell maturation in mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>OCT4 mRNA and protein were detected in extracts from both 1st and 2nd trimester ovaries and testes. In ovarian extracts a marked increase in expression of VASA and DAZL mRNA and protein occurred in the 2nd trimester. In testicular extracts VASA mRNA and protein were low/undetectable in 1st trimester and increased in the 2nd trimester whereas the total amount of DAZL did not seem to change. During the 1st trimester, germ cells were OCT4 positive but did not express VASA. These results are in contrast to the situation in mice where expression of Vasa is initiated in Oct4 positive primordial germ cells as they enter the gonadal ridge. In the 2nd trimester germ cells with intense cytoplasmic staining for VASA were present in both sexes; these cells were OCT4 negative. DAZL expression overlapped with both OCT4 and VASA and changed from the nuclear to the cytoplasmic compartment as cells became OCT4-negative. In males, OCT4-positive and VASA-positive subpopulations of germ cells coexisted within the same seminiferous cords but in the ovary there was a distinct spatial distribution of cells with OCT4 expressed by smaller, peripherally located, germ cells whereas DAZL and VASA were immunolocalised to larger (more mature) centrally located cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p><italic>OCT4</italic>, <italic>DAZL </italic>and <italic>VASA </italic>are expressed by human fetal germ cells but their patterns of expression are temporally and spatially distinct. In the 1st trimester OCT4 was detected in most germ cells. In the 2nd trimester the onset of expression of <italic>VASA </italic>was associated with the formation of oocytes and spermatogonia both of which were OCT-4 negative. Relocation of DAZL from nucleus to cytoplasm paralleled the down regulation of OCT4 and the onset of expression of VASA. These data reveal similarities between the expression of key regulatory proteins within germ cells as they mature in male and female fetal human gonads suggesting that in the female these maturational changes are not determined by entry into meiosis.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The ovaries and testes both develop from an identical structure, the embryonic genital ridge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Germ cells do not originate from within the genital ridges but differentiate from clusters of cells located in the extra-embryonic proximal epiblast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Primordial germ cells (PGC) proliferate and migrate via the embryonal endoderm reaching the gonadal ridges at about 5<sup>th </sup>week of pregnancy in the human (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]). Within the genital ridge germ cells have been shown to express the pluripotency markers OCT4 (POU5F1, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]) and NANOG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] and human embryonic germ cell lines, capable of differentiating into a number of cell lineages, have been established from early gonadal tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. We have previously reported that during the 1<sup>st </sup>trimester of pregnancy the germ cells (gonocytes) in the testicular cords all express OCT4 but that only a subpopulation of germ cells remains OCT4 positive during the 2nd trimester [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In previous studies OCT4 positive germ cells were detected in the cortical region of human fetal ovaries recovered during the 2nd trimester [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]; however expression of OCT4 has not been investigated in the 1st trimester ovary.</p><p>Studies in knockout mice have identified a number of genes the expression of which is critical for germ cell survival and functional maturation in both ovary and testis. One such gene is <italic>Dazl</italic>, an RNA binding protein that is a member of a conserved gene family members of which include <italic>BOULE </italic>and <italic>DAZ </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. A second example is <italic>Mvh </italic>(mouse Vasa homologue) a gene that encodes an RNA helicase which is specific to the germ cell lineage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In mice <italic>Dazl </italic>mRNA is first detectable in post-migratory germ cells on e11.5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and the protein has been immunolocalised to the cytoplasm of fetal and adult germ cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Targeted deletion of the <italic>Dazl </italic>gene results in germ cell loss in both males and females [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In <italic>Dazl </italic>-/- females germ cell loss occurred in fetal ovaries at the time of meiotic entry and adult ovaries did not contain oocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. In <italic>Dazl </italic>-/- males the pattern of germ cell loss is variable and in some studies has been reported to occur during fetal life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] whilst in others it was associated with spermatogonial differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] or entry to meiosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p><italic>VASA </italic>is a member of the DEAD box family of genes first identified in <italic>Drosophila </italic>where it was shown to be essential for female germ cell development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. In mice with targeted deletions of <italic>Mvh </italic>ovarian function appeared normal but males were infertile with demise of germ cells at the zygotene stage of meiosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].

Information on expression of VASA in human fetal gonads is limited but protein was detected in OCT4 negative cells in a testis at 21 weeks gestation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. First trimester ovaries have not been examined but in the 2nd trimester VASA has been localised to oocytes within primordial follicles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>In the present paper we have extended our studies on the germ cell subpopulations within the human fetal ovaries and testes to determine when and where DAZL and VASA proteins are expressed and have performed co-staining for OCT4 as this is commonly used to delineate the germ 'stem cell' population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. These studies have revealed a dynamic and overlapping pattern in the expression of these germ cell markers, revealed that nuclear localisation of DAZL parallels the onset of VASA expression, and highlighted similarities in the development of male and female germ cell lineages.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Expression of mRNAs for <italic>OCT4</italic>, <italic>DAZL </italic>and <italic>VASA </italic>in first and second trimester gonads</title><p>In ovaries <italic>OCT4 </italic>mRNA was detected in both the 1st and 2nd trimester samples with a slight, but non-significant decrease in the older samples (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>).

A similar trend in expression was noted in the testes but was less striking. Expression of OCT4 was maintained in both ovary and testis at all gestational ages examined consistent with persistence of a putative germ 'stem cell' population for many months in the human gonads although the extent to which these cells can acquire/maintain pluripotency <italic>in vitro </italic>remains unresolved (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]). In the 2nd trimester testis all seminiferous cords contained a mixture of OCT4 positive and OCT4 negative germ cells a situation which is different to that in rodents where the expression of OCT4 is down regulated synchronously in all germ cells within the cords before birth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. In the human fetal ovary expression of OCT4 protein was restricted to oogonia in the peripheral zone of the organ, in agreement with the observations of Stoop <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In mice expression of <italic>Oct4 </italic>mRNA is extinguished in a rostro-caudal wave coincident with meiotic entry of germ cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].</p><p>Co-incident and overlapping patterns of expression of these germ cell specific proteins were revealed by fluorescent co-immunolocalisation on fixed specimens from a range of gestational ages. Previous studies have immunolocalised DAZL in a small number of samples recovered in the 2nd trimester [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] but we believe this is the first study to document expression in 1st trimester samples and to compare expression with that of OCT4 and VASA. In the 1st trimester, DAZL was detected in the nuclear compartment in OCT4 positive germ cells in both sexes. In a previous study we immunolocalised DAZL to the nuclei of male germ cells in a single sample at 17 weeks gestation and in the cytoplasm of female germ cells at 15 weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Other studies have claimed that DAZL is present in both the cytoplasm and nucleus of male germ cells at 20&#x02013;21 weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. We have extended these observations and demonstrated that DAZL is localised to the nuclear compartment in OCT4 positive cells (gonocytes and oogonia). In the ovaries localisation of DAZL to the cytoplasmic compartment appeared to be transient occurring as OCT4 expression but thereafter the amount of protein declined and was low in the largest ovarian germ cells, i.e. those that had formed into primordial follicles and those approaching that stage. This was evident when a morphometric analysis was performed showing that the germ cells immunopositive for DAZL alone were smaller than those containing both DAZL and VASA, which were in turn smaller than those only immunopositive for VASA.</p><p>Two studies on human populations have provided preliminary evidence that expression of <italic>DAZL </italic>is important for normal functioning of the human germ line. The first study reported a strong association between several common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and age at menopause in a sample population of 324 women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. In a second study a patient with premature ovarian failure at age 34 was found to contain a homozygous mutation of <italic>DAZL </italic>(Arg to Gly at 115) in a region of the protein critical for RNA binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. The situation in men is complicated by the presence of multiple copies of the closely related <italic>DAZ </italic>gene on the Y chromosome, deletions of which have been frequently documented as a cause of male infertility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. However a patient with a homozygous mutation in <italic>DAZL </italic>(Asn 10 Cys) was reported to be azoospermic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].</p><p>The marked increase in expression of <italic>VASA </italic>between 9 and 14 weeks gestation suggested to us that this was coincident with the entry of female germ cells into meiosis. However increases in both protein and mRNA were also demonstrated in male germ cells suggesting that the onset of expression of <italic>VASA </italic>was associated the maturation of the gonocytes into prespermatogonia rather than meiotic entry per se. In the ovary VASA was detected in the cytoplasm of in slightly larger, more mature germ cells than DAZL, and was also present in oocytes within primordial follicles. Previous studies that have detected expression of VASA in cytoplasm of germ cells within the fetal ovary and testes at 17 weeks gestation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Co-staining of sections with OCT4 and VASA has extended these findings by demonstrating that VASA protein is not expressed in gonocytes or oogonia in the 1<sup>st </sup>trimester and provides a useful method for identifying the different populations of germ cells present within the 2<sup>nd </sup>trimester gonads.</p><p>Examination of the 3' UTR of the <italic>Mvh </italic>mRNA has revealed a number of putative Dazl-binding sites that are conserved between human, rat and mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Our data provide some additional support for a role for DAZL in initiating expression of <italic>VASA </italic>although further studies are required preferably using isolated human germ cells. DAZL has also been implicated in the regulation of other conserved germ-cell RNA-binding proteins including PUM2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], the human homolog of <italic>Pumilio </italic>that is required for maintenance of germ line stem cells in <italic>Drosophila </italic>and <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>By documenting the differential and partially overlapping patterns of expression of OCT4, DAZL and VASA proteins in the human fetal ovary and testis we have gained new insight into parallels in the maturation of germ cells in these two organs. Our findings clearly demonstrate changes in overall germ cell maturation with increasing gestation, and indicate a switch from <italic>OCT4 </italic>expression in the less mature germ cells (gonocytes, peripheral oogonia) to <italic>VASA </italic>expression in the more mature germ cells (prespermatogonia, oogonia in nests, oocytes). In testicular samples germ cells at different stages of maturation co-exist within the same seminiferous cords. Both male and female germ cells showed a similar pattern of change with development, despite the onset of meiosis in the female but not in the male, suggesting that although increases in expression of <italic>DAZL </italic>and <italic>VASA </italic>in the ovary may be related to meiotic entry there are underlying developmental patterns common to both sexes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Tissue recovery and processing</title><p>Human fetal gonads were obtained following termination of pregnancy during the first (61&#x02013;64 days gestation, n = 11) and 2nd trimesters (14 to 19 weeks gestation, n = 29). Women gave written consent according to national guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] and the study was approved by the Lothian Ethics Committee. Termination of pregnancy was induced by treatment with mifepristone (200 mg, orally), followed by misoprostol (Pharmacia, Surrey UK; 200 mg every 3 h, per vaginam). None of the terminations was for reasons of fetal abnormality, and all fetuses used in this study appeared morphologically normal. Gestational age was determined by ultrasound examination before termination and was confirmed by subsequent direct measurement of foot length in 2nd trimester samples. The sex of the 1st trimester fetal gonads was determined by PCR for the <italic>SRY </italic>gene as detailed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Testes and ovaries were dissected carefully from the fetal abdominal cavity and either snap frozen and stored at -70&#x000b0;C prior to extraction of total protein or RNA, or fixed in Bouins fluid for 2&#x02013;3 h, stored in 70% ethanol and processed into paraffin wax using standard methods.</p></sec><sec><title>RNA Extraction and RT PCR</title><p>Total RNA was extracted from fetal gonads using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, UK) for mid trimester gonads and the RNeasy Micro Kit for 1st trimester gonads (with on-column DNase digestion Qiagen, UK) The RNA was primed for reverse transcription with oligo(dT) primer (Applied Biosystems, UK) at 65&#x000b0;C for 10 min.

Paisley, UK). Amplification was continued for 45 cycles with signal acquisition at 84&#x000b0;C after each round of extension.

Primer sequences are given in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>, Standard curves for <italic>GAPD</italic>, <italic>OCT4</italic>, <italic>DAZL </italic>and <italic>VASA </italic>were derived by making a series of dilutions (1 in 5 to 1 in 10000) of first-strand cDNA from a mid trimester ovary. The number of cycles needed to yield a fluorescent signal above background (the cross-over point, Cp) at each dilution was plotted against the log of relative concentration using LightCycler Software (Molecular Dynamics Ltd, UK). The dilutions yielded a straight line for each product, confirming that Cp is a good indicator of target concentration across at least 2 orders of magnitude. The slopes of these curves are a measure of the efficiency of the PCR, which gave an amplification rate of 1.8-fold/cycle for <italic>GAPD </italic>and <italic>DAZL</italic>, and 1.7-fold/cycle for <italic>OCT4 </italic>and <italic>VASA</italic>.
