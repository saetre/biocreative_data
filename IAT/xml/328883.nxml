Both codons code for glutamic acid but the mutation is known to increase gene expression by four fold. We show that the mutation has an effect only if it is located in the beginning of a gene but not if located internally. Data are presented that suggest that the reason for the increased expression by the mutation is the potential formation of one more base pair between the mRNA and 16S ribosomal RNA. Gene expression varies about 16 fold as the number of potential base pairs within the sequence 1471-1480 in 16S RNA increase from two to ten. We also give evidence that supports the idea that the presence of rare codons near the beginning of the mRNA can affect expression.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00099-0141-a" xlink:role="5249"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00099-0139.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5247"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00099-0140.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5248"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00099-0141.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5249"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00099-0142.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5250"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00099-0143.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5251"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
