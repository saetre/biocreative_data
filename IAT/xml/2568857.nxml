The major lysosomal membrane proteins 1 and 2 (LAMP-1 and LAMP-2) are recruited to the <italic>Salmonella</italic>-containing vacuole as well as <italic>Salmonella</italic>- associated filaments (Sifs) that emerge from the vacuole. LAMP-1 is a dominant membrane marker for the vacuole and Sifs. Its colocalization with both is dependent on a major secreted bacterial virulence protein, SifA. Here, we show that SifA is required for the recruitment of LAMP-2 and can be used as a second independent marker for both the bacterial vacuolar membrane and Sifs. Further, RNAi studies revealed that in LAMP-1 depleted cells, the bacteria remain membrane bound as measured by their association with LAMP-2 protein. In contrast, LAMP-2 depletion increased the amount of LAMP-1 free bacteria. Together, the data suggests that despite its abundance, LAMP-1 is not essential, but LAMP-2 may be partially important for the <italic>Salmonella</italic>-containing vacuolar membrane.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="6"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Salmonella</italic> infection causes millions of infections each year resulting in hundreds of thousands of deaths <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003538-Zweu1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

Several papers have indicated that LAMP-2 is localized to the SCV, but a comparative, side-by-side analysis of LAMP-2 and LAMP-1 recruitment to the SCV and Sifs has not been undertaken. We, therefore, infected HeLa cells with <italic>Salmonella</italic> (expressing GFP to ease detection of bacteria) and allowed the infection to proceed for 18 hours. After this period, the cells were fixed and immuno-stained to detect LAMP-1 or LAMP-2, and subsequently imaged.

Cytoplasmic actin was used as a measure of total cellular protein and cell growth. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003538-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>, scrambled RNAi oligos did not significantly alter total levels of actin, suggesting that they did not affect cell growth. Unexpectedly these scrambled oligos increased LAMP-1 and LAMP-2 levels in cells. In contrast, specific oligonucleotides designed to knock down LAMP-1 and LAMP-2 consistently showed reduced actin levels. These cells were nonetheless adherent and viable, suggesting they were slowed in growth. However, despite reduced growth cells knocked down in LAMP-1 displayed LAMP-2 levels that were modestly increased relative to control incubations. Similarly cells knocked down in LAMP-2 displayed LAMP-1 levels that were close to those seen in control incubations. Importantly actin levels in cells knocked down in LAMP-1 or LAMP-2 were comparable and this enabled us to ascertain the effect of knockdown of each protein on the recruitment of the other, to the SCV. To facilitate the analysis we determined levels of LAMP-1 and LAMP-2 detected normalized for actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003538-g003">Fig. 3B&#x02013;C</xref>) for all samples.

However, it excludes digestive, soluble enzymes, such as cathepsins, which are usually found in the lumen of the lysosome. The SCV also excludes membrane-bound receptors, such as the mannose-6-phosphate receptor that deliver cathepsins and other soluble cargo to the lysosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003538-GarciadelPortillo1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Characterization of the recruitment of LAMP-2 along with that of LAMP-1 enabled each to be used as a marker for the SCV, as well as testing (in RNAi experiments) whether each was important to the SCV membrane.</p><p>Numerous effectors secreted by <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> modify the host cell and the functions of each effector appear to be distinct. Examples include SseG, which is thought to be important for recruitment of the Golgi; SseJ, which esterifies host cholesterol; SipB, which binds and activates caspase-1, SopE1 and SopE2 act as G-nucleotide exchange factors; and SipA and SipC, which directly bind actin and modulating bacterial uptake <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003538-Salcedo1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003538-McGhie1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>SifA influences the position of the SCV, is necessary for Sif production, and is required for the recruitment of LAMP-1 to these membranes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003538-Stein1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003538-SteeleMortimer1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. Our data suggest that SifA is also required for the recruitment of LAMP-2, possibly explaining why SifA is essential for membrane stability of the SCV. In addition, our data implicate the presence of a cellular mechanism engaged by SifA that enables the recruitment of LAMP-1 and LAMP-2, while circumventing mannose-6-phosphate receptor trafficking between the Golgi and lysosomes. Further, although LAMP-1 is the major lysosomal membrane protein in cells and the dominant protein marker of the SCV, we find that it is not essential for the SCV membrane. In contrast, LAMP-2 which is present at three fold lower levels, does contribute in a measurable way to the composition and/or maintenance of a stable SCV.</p><p>In mouse models, LAMP-1/LAMP-2 double knockout is embryonically lethal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003538-Eskelinen3">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>.

The LAMP-1 knockout mice display a mild phenotype, and apart from mild regional astrogliosis and altered immunoreactivity against cathepsin D in the brain, all tissues in the mouse are similar to controls <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003538-Andrejewski1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, their lysosomes are similar to control mice in both form and function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003538-Andrejewski1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. In contrast, the LAMP-2 knockout mice display a more severe phenotype. Fifty percent of the mice die by 6 weeks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003538-Tanaka1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. In these mice, the knockout of LAMP-2 leads to cardiomyopathy and an increase in the amount of autophagy/lysosome compartments in many tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003538-Stypmann1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. However, these compartments are less efficient at protein degradation than their wild-type counterparts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003538-Stypmann1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. These symptoms mirror those of human Danon disease which is attributed to mutations in LAMP-2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003538-Stypmann1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003538-Nishino1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, despite similarities in location, LAMP-2 function in the host is likely to be distinct from that of LAMP-1. Our data support that LAMP-2 provides a more critical function in formation, composition and/or maintainence of the SCV.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Antibodies and reagents</title><p>Anti-LAMP-1 mouse monoclonal antibody, H4A3, was purchased from Iowa Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank and used at 1&#x02236;1000.

For monolayers infected with wild-type or mutant bacteria, values were obtained for the total cholesterol in 20 cells. The total amount of colocalization in each cell was quantitated by measuring and integrating the intensity values over all selected voxels in the Filipin UV channel.
