These metabolites are products of the sulfate assimilation pathway. CysQ, a 3&#x02032;-phosphoadenosine-5&#x02032;-phosphatase, is considered an important regulator of this pathway in plants, yeast, and other bacteria. By controlling the pools of 3&#x02032;-phosphoadenosine 5&#x02032;-phosphate (PAP) and 3&#x02032;-phosphoadenosine 5&#x02032;-phosphosulfate (PAPS), CysQ has the potential to modulate flux in the biosynthesis of essential sulfur-containing metabolites. Bioinformatic analysis of the <italic>Mtb</italic> genome suggests the presence of a CysQ homologue encoded by the gene <italic>Rv2131c</italic>. However, a recent biochemical study assigned the protein&#x02019;s function as a class IV fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase. In the present study, we expressed <italic>Rv2131c</italic> heterologously and found that the protein dephosphorylates PAP in a magnesium-dependent manner, with optimal activity observed between pH 8.5 and pH 9.5 using 0.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>. A sensitive electrospray ionization mass spectrometry-based assay was used to extract the kinetic parameters for PAP, revealing a <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> (8.1 &#x000b1; 3.1 &#x003bc;M) and <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> (5.4 &#x000b1; 1.1 s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) comparable to those reported for other CysQ enzymes. The second-order rate constant for PAP was determined to be over 3 orders of magnitude greater than those determined for <italic>myo</italic>-inositol 1-phosphate (IMP) and fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP), previously considered to be the primary substrates of this enzyme. Moreover, the ability of the <italic>Rv2131c</italic>-encoded enzyme to dephosphorylate PAP and PAPS <italic>in vivo</italic> was confirmed by functional complementation of an <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> &#x00394;<italic>cysQ</italic> mutant. Taken together, these studies indicate that <italic>Rv2131c</italic> encodes a CysQ enzyme that may play a role in mycobacterial sulfur metabolism.</p></abstract><contract-sponsor>National Institutes of Health, United States</contract-sponsor><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-old-9</meta-name><meta-value>bi702453s</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>document-id-new-14</meta-name><meta-value>bi-2007-02453s</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-wrap></article-meta></front><body><p>Tuberculosis poses a critical threat to global health.

Notable examples include sulfolipid-1, a glycolipid constituent of the <italic>Mtb</italic> cell wall that has been correlated with virulence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>), and mycothiol, an abundant low molecular mass thiol whose antioxidant activity may facilitate bacterial survival in the host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>). In addition, disruption of the reductive branch of the sulfate assimilation pathway has been shown to attenuate <italic>Mtb</italic> virulence and persistence during the chronic phase of infection in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>). Genes involved in the sulfate assimilation pathway are frequently upregulated under conditions that mimic the latent stage of the <italic>Mtb</italic> life cycle; some of these genes lack a human counterpart, making them attractive drug targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>). Since dormant mycobacteria are impervious to antibiotics which rely on active cell division, the machinery used by these bacteria in the metabolism of sulfur may represent new targets for therapeutic intervention.</p><p>The sulfate assimilation pathway of <italic>Mtb</italic> is analogous to the prototypical pathway of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (Figure <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>). It begins with the uptake of inorganic sulfate, which is subsequently activated by condensation with ATP in a reaction catalyzed by ATP sulfurylase. This enzyme, encoded by the genes <italic>cysD</italic> and <italic>cysN</italic>, is a heterodimeric G-protein that couples GTP hydrolysis with the sulfurylation of ATP to generate adenosine 5&#x02032;-phosphosulfate (APS). APS is then phosphorylated at the 3&#x02032;-position by APS kinase (CysC) to give 3&#x02032;-phosphoadenosine 5&#x02032;-phosphosulfate (PAPS). In <italic>E. coli</italic>, this intermediate is reduced to sulfite and 3&#x02032;-phosphoadenosine 5&#x02032;-phosphate (PAP) by PAPS reductase (CysH), which uses thioredoxin as an electron donor. Sulfite is then reduced to sulfide, which is incorporated into several reduced sulfur-containing metabolites, such as cysteine, methionine, and mycothiol, by other enzymes in the Cys regulon. In <italic>Mtb</italic>, however, this reduction cascade emanates from APS, which is reduced to sulfite by APS reductase (also termed CysH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>). This leaves PAPS to serve as the sulfuryl group donor for a set of eukaryotic-like sulfotransferases, which generate sulfated metabolites believed to mediate host&#x02212;pathogen interactions and signaling pathways in the bacterium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Sulfate assimilation pathways of <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>Mtb</italic>.

Mutations in the <italic>cysQ</italic> gene result in cysteine and sulfite auxotrophy under aerobic conditions, which supports a key role for this enzyme in sulfur metabolism. CysQ is believed to regulate the intracellular level of PAPS, which may be cytotoxic at high concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>). In addition, CysQ is thought to modulate PAP levels in the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>), an activity that might further regulate the biosynthesis of reduced sulfur-containing metabolites since PAP is a competitive inhibitor of PAPS reductase. Interestingly, PAP accumulation negatively regulates the activity of other important bacterial enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>). Examples include oligoribonuclease, an exonuclease which degrades small ribonucleotides, and phosphopantetheinyltransferase, an enzyme which transfers the 4-phosphopantetheine group of coenzyme A to acyl carrier protein during fatty acid biosynthesis and the production of secondary metabolites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>). Thus, CysQ may not only regulate the cell&#x02019;s ability to metabolize sulfur but could also play a role in other essential bacterial processes. Yet, no homologue of the <italic>E. coli</italic> CysQ has been characterized in <italic>Mtb</italic>.</p><p>Given the many parallels between sulfur metabolism in <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>Mtb</italic>, we reasoned that a CysQ-like phosphatase could be functional in mycobacteria. Upon searching the <italic>Mtb</italic> genome, we discovered a gene, <italic>Rv2131c</italic>, whose encoded protein shares 31% amino acid sequence identity with the <italic>E. coli</italic> CysQ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>). However, a recent report by Gu and co-workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>) indicated the encoded enzyme may serve as a bifunctional inositol monophosphatase and fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, a finding that supports a role for <italic>Rv2131c</italic> in <italic>myo</italic>-inositol biosynthesis and challenges its assignment to the mycobacterial sulfate assimilation pathway.</p><p>Here, we clarify the physiological role of <italic>Rv2131c</italic> by providing conclusive evidence that the gene product can function as a CysQ phosphatase. Genetic complementation of an <italic>E. coli</italic> &#x00394;<italic>cysQ</italic> mutant with the <italic>Mtb</italic> gene unequivocally establishes its ability to dephosphorylate PAP and PAPS <italic>in vivo</italic>. In addition, following the heterologous expression of <italic>Rv2131c</italic> in <italic>E. coli</italic>, the enzyme was purified and characterized to obtain kinetic parameters for PAP, <italic>myo</italic>-inositol 1-phosphate (IMP), and fructose 1,6-bisphosphate (FBP). The data confirm that PAP is the preferred <italic>in vitro</italic> substrate of <italic>Rv2131c</italic>, redefining the substrate specificity of this enzyme and validating its assignment as a CysQ phosphatase. Taken together, these findings suggest that <italic>Rv2131c</italic> may serve as an important regulator of sulfur metabolism in <italic>Mtb</italic>. With the potential to manipulate sulfation levels in the cell and regulate the biosynthesis of essential reduced sulfur-containing metabolites, CysQ may be an attractive target for antibiotic therapy.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec2"><title>Experimental Procedures</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>Materials</title><p><italic>Pfu</italic> DNA polymerase was from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA).

After 10 min, the absorbance of the reaction at 630 nm was determined using a Molecular Devices SpectraMax 190 UV&#x02212;visible plate reader. A standard curve generated using monobasic potassium phosphate was used to correlate the absorbance of the reaction mixture with the concentration of inorganic phosphate in solution. Since enzyme activity was determined to be linear under these reaction conditions, the initial rate of the reaction was calculated by dividing the concentration of liberated phosphate by the reaction time. Control reactions without enzyme were treated identically and used to account for background hydrolysis of the substrate. For the determination of the optimum pH range, metal cofactor, and MgCl<sub>2</sub> concentration, the corresponding factors were varied. To evaluate the effect of various alkali metal cations on enzyme activity, increasing amounts of each cation were added to the standard reaction mixture.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.5"><title>Enzyme Kinetics</title><p>The kinetic parameters for PAP were determined using a previously described electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>) with some modifications, as described below.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.6"><title>Mass Spectrometry</title><p>Mass spectra were acquired using a quadrupole time-of-flight (Q-Tof) mass spectrometer equipped with a Z-spray electrospray ionization (ESI) source (Q-Tof Premier; Waters, Beverly, MA).

However, the catalytic efficiencies for these substrates are over 3 orders of magnitude lower than the corresponding second-order rate constant for PAP, indicating that PAP is the preferred substrate for Rv2131c. These findings suggest the enzyme exhibits only nominal activity with IMP and FBP <italic>in vivo</italic>. While isolated activity with certain inositol phosphates has been described for a number of CysQ homologues, PAP is widely defined as the superior substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref40">40</xref>&#x02212;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">42</xref>). The slight promiscuity of these enzymes can possibly be attributed to the structural similarities between these substrates and the conservation of a common metal-binding motif and core fold among members of the phosphomonoesterase protein family, which includes various inositol phosphatases, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, and the <italic>E. coli</italic> CysQ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>).</p><p>PAP phosphatases have also been shown to exhibit activity with PAPS, another intermediate of the sulfate assimilation pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref42">42</xref>). Unfortunately, the phosphosulfate bond of this substrate is prone to rapid hydrolysis, which results in conversion to PAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref43">43</xref>). Consequently, the kinetic analysis of this substrate is complicated by the presence of a competing substrate. In addition, commercial PAPS (Sigma, EMD Biosciences) is supplied as a lithium salt. Since lithium is a potent inhibitor of this enzyme class (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>), ion-exchange chromatography must be used to purify the substrate prior to its use in biochemical assays. This purification process results in significant decomposition of the compound to PAP and sulfate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref41">41</xref>), precluding its accurate kinetic characterization. For these reasons, attempts to obtain kinetic parameters for PAPS that would enable a comparison with the other substrates in this study were unsuccessful. However, a qualitative assessment of [<sup>35</sup>S]PAPS hydrolysis by Rv2131c using thin-layer chromatography and Phosphorimager analysis suggests that PAPS is a substrate for the enzyme (data not shown).</p></sec><sec id="sec3.7"><title>Genetic Complementation of an <italic>E. coli</italic> &#x00394;<italic>cysQ</italic> Mutant</title><p>Given the similarities in sequence and substrate selectivity between the <italic>Rv2131c</italic>-encoded enzyme and the <italic>E. coli</italic> CysQ, we chose to validate the function of <italic>Rv2131c</italic> through genetic complementation studies in <italic>E. coli</italic>. A mutant strain of <italic>E. coli</italic> lacking CysQ was transformed with <italic>Rv2131c</italic> in a pBAD18 plasmid under the control of an arabinose-inducible promoter. Disruption of the <italic>cysQ</italic> gene in <italic>E. coli</italic> results in a growth requirement for sulfite or cysteine (Figure <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>). Thus, following growth on LB agar with ampicillin and kanamycin, isolated colonies of the transformed cells were plated onto M9 minimal medium containing sulfate as the sole sulfur source. Arabinose was also included in the medium to enable overexpression of the <italic>Mtb</italic> gene. Complementation of the mutant strain clearly demonstrated the ability of the <italic>Rv2131c</italic> gene product to restore prototrophy <italic>in vivo</italic> (Figure <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>B). Growth of the mutant strain was restored to levels observed in the presence of sulfite after just 24 h of growth. Importantly, the vector control maintained cysteine and sulfite auxotrophy (Figure <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>C).

Biochemical studies of the <italic>Rv2131c</italic> enzyme revealed its ability to dephosphorylate PAP in a magnesium-dependent manner that was sensitive to inhibition by lithium, sodium, and potassium ions. The enzyme exhibited optimal activity with 0.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> at pH 8.5&#x02212;9.5. A sensitive ESI-MS assay was used to extract the kinetic parameters for PAP, which were comparable to those of the <italic>E. coli</italic> CysQ. PAP was the substrate utilized most efficiently by the enzyme, which exhibited relatively little activity with IMP and FBP. Genetic complementation studies in <italic>E. coli</italic> confirmed its ability to dephosphorylate PAP and PAPS <italic>in vivo</italic>, reaffirming its place in the sulfate assimilation pathway of <italic>Mtb</italic>.</p><p>While the <italic>Rv2131c</italic> enzyme was originally classified as a bifunctional inositol monophosphatase and fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, our findings suggest its primary physiological role relates to mycobacterial sulfur metabolism and not to the biosynthesis of <italic>myo</italic>-inositol. By controlling the pools of PAP and PAPS in the cell, Rv2131c is poised to serve as a key regulator of the sulfate assimilation pathway. This enzyme, which we rename CysQ in accordance with its genomic annotation, has the potential to manipulate sulfation levels in the cell and control the biosynthesis of essential reduced sulfur-containing metabolites. Future studies will investigate the effects of <italic>cysQ</italic> deletion on sulfation levels in <italic>Mtb</italic> and evaluate its importance for bacterial growth and pathogenesis.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank J.
