Evidence from several laboratories studying transformed murine LbetaT2 gonadotropes indicates that activins signal through Smad-dependent and/or Smad-independent pathways, similar to those used by transforming growth factor beta-1 (TGFB1) in other cell types. Therefore, given common intracellular signaling mechanisms of these two ligands, we examined whether TGFBs can also induce transcription of <italic>Fshb </italic>in LbetaT2 cells as well as in purified primary murine gonadotropes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Murine <italic>Fshb </italic>promoter-reporter (-1990/+1 m<italic>Fshb</italic>-luc) activity was measured in LbetaT2 cells treated with activin A or TGFB1, and in cells transfected with either activin or TGFB receptors. The ability of the ligands to stimulate phosphorylation of Smads 2 and 3 in LbetaT2 cells was measured by western blot analysis, and expression of TGFB type I and II receptors was assessed by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction in both LbetaT2 cells and primary gonadotropes purified from male mice of different ages. Finally, regulation of endogenous murine <italic>Fshb </italic>mRNA levels by activin A and TGFB1 in purified gonadotropes and whole pituitary cultures was measured using quantitative RT-PCR.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Activin A dose-dependently stimulated -1990/+1 m<italic>Fshb</italic>-luc activity in LbetaT2 cells, but TGFB1 had no effect at doses up to 5 nM. Similarly, activin A, but not TGFB1, stimulated Smad 2 and 3 phosphorylation in these cells. Constitutively active forms of the activin (Acvr1b-T206D) and TGFB (TGFBR1-T204D) type I receptors strongly stimulated -1990/+1 m<italic>Fshb</italic>-luc activity, showing that mechanisms down stream of Tgfbr1 seem to be intact in LbetaT2 cells. RT-PCR analysis of LbetaT2 cells and whole adult murine pituitaries indicated that both expressed <italic>Tgfbr1 </italic>mRNA, but that <italic>Tgfbr2 </italic>was not detected in LbetaT2 cells. When cells were transfected with a human TGFBR2 expression construct, TGFB1 acquired the ability to significantly stimulate -1990/+1 m<italic>Fshb</italic>-luc activity. In contrast to LbetaT2 cells, primary murine gonadotropes from young mice (8&#x02013;10 weeks) contained low, but detectable levels of <italic>Tgfbr2 </italic>mRNA and these levels increased in older mice (1 yr). A second surprise was the finding that treatment of purified primary gonadotropes with TGFB1 decreased murine <italic>Fshb </italic>mRNA expression by 95% whereas activin A stimulated expression by 31-fold.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These data indicate that TGFB1-insensitivity in LbetaT2 cells results from a deficiency in <italic>Tgfbr2 </italic>expression. In primary gonadotropes, however, expression of <italic>Tgfbr2 </italic>does occur, and its presence permits TGFB1 to inhibit <italic>Fshb </italic>transcription, whereas activin A stimulates it. These divergent actions of activin A and TGFB1 were unexpected and show that the two ligands may act through distinct pathways to cause opposing biological effects in primary murine gonadotropes.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) synthesis, secretion, and action are critical for reproductive function in mammals, particularly in females [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. FSH production is regulated by a variety of neuroendocrine, intra-pituitary, and gonadal factors. Arguably, the most potent and selective stimulators of FSH synthesis are the activins, members of the transforming growth factor beta (TGFB) superfamily. Within the anterior pituitary, activins (activin B, in particular) act in paracrine/autocrine fashion to induce expression of the FSH beta (<italic>Fshb</italic>) subunit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], the rate-limiting step in mature FSH production.</p><p>Several other factors that regulate FSH synthesis appear to have their actions via synergy with or perturbation of endogenous activin signaling. For example, activins synergistically stimulate rat and sheep <italic>Fshb </italic>transcription with gonadotropin releasing hormone (GNRH1) via cross-talk between activin and GNRH1 signaling pathways as well as through regulation of GNRH1 receptor expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Testicular androgens regulate <italic>Fshb </italic>transcription both directly and indirectly, although these effects vary across species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In sheep, the direct actions of androgens on transcription appear to require intact activin signal transduction mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Follistatins (FST) inhibit FSH production by binding activins and blocking the latter from interacting with their cell surface receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Similarly, gonadal inhibins suppress FSH synthesis via antagonism of activins; in this case through competition with activins for binding to activin type II receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Thus, many of the endocrine and paracrine factors known to affect FSH production do so through an interaction with or disruption of activin signaling. These and other data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] indicate that the activins are critical for normal FSH regulation.</p><p>Both activins and TGFBs bind hetero-tetrameric receptor complexes consisting of ligand specific type I and type II receptor serine/threonine kinases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Activins bind one of two type II receptors, ACVR2A or ACVR2B, which then recruit and phosphorylate the activin type IB receptor, ACVR1B or ALK4. In analogous fashion, TGFB1 binds TGFBR2, which recruits and phosphorylates TGFBR1 (also known as ALK5). Once activated, ACVR1B and TGFBR1 can phosphorylate Smad2 and Smad3 on C-terminal serine residues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], and can also activate TGFB-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]</p><p>In rodents, activins stimulate <italic>Fshb </italic>subunit gene transcription through both immediate-early and indirect (delayed or late) signaling pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. There is evidence to implicate Smads in <italic>Fshb </italic>gene transcription because they are rapidly phosphorylated and trans-located to the nucleus rapidly following activin A treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. In rats and mice, interference with Smad2 or Smad3 signaling impairs activin A-regulated <italic>Fshb </italic>transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. However, these proteins seem to play less important roles in activin A-induced <italic>Fshb </italic>transcription in sheep and humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], where Smad-independent mechanisms mediated by TGFB-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) appear to be critical for the former.</p><p>Like activins, the TGFB isoforms 1, 2, and 3 also phosphorylate and activate Smad2, Smad3 and TAK1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. TGFB1 is produced within rat pituitary lactotropes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Therefore, it is possible that TGFBs, acting in a paracrine manner, may also stimulate rodent <italic>Fshb </italic>transcription in gonadotropes via a similar Smad2/3- and/or TAK1-dependent mechanism. If this occurs, however, how could gonadotrope cells discriminate intracellularly between activin and TGFB-generated signals, specifically with respect to FSH regulation? This is an important question, in light of the fact that various physiological mechanisms that have evolved to spatially and temporally restrict activin's actions do not affect TGFB signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. For example, ovarian inhibin B production and action during metestrus and diestrus are critical for the suppression of activin-stimulated FSH production at these times of the rat estrous cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Inhibin B may play a similar role during the follicular phase of the human menstrual cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. In addition, FST is dynamically regulated in the pituitary across the rat estrous cycle and its patterns of expression appear to be critical for the proper timing of the secondary FSH surge on the morning of proestrus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Neither the inhibins nor FST suppress TGFB1 actions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. Therefore, antagonism of activins' stimulation of FSH by these proteins could theoretically be circumvented by unfettered TGFB1 stimulation of Smad2/3- and/or TAK1-dependent signaling mechanisms. We, therefore, examined TGFB1-regulated expression of murine <italic>Fshb </italic>subunit transcription to determine whether or not gonadotropes have evolved a mechanism to discriminate between the activin and TGFB ligands.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Reagents and constructs</title><p>Human recombinant (rh-) TGFB1, rh-activin A, recombinant mouse (rm)-follistatin 288 were purchased from R&#x00026;D systems (Minneapolis, MN).

Although TGFB isoforms also activate these pathways, we found that TGFB1 fails to regulate murine <italic>Fshb </italic>transcription in L&#x003b2;T2 cells, apparently because they do not express the TGFB type II receptor, Tgfbr2. However, when the cells were transiently transfected with the receptor, TGFB1 stimulated murine <italic>Fshb </italic>transcription. In striking contrast, we observed that gonadotrope cells purified from male mice expressed low levels of <italic>Tgfbr2 </italic>mRNA and that TGFB1 suppressed <italic>Fshb </italic>mRNA in these cells as well as in mixed murine pituitary cell cultures. Because over-expression of TGFBR2 allowed TGFB1 to stimulate the -1990/+1 m<italic>Fshb</italic>-luc construct in L&#x003b2;T2 cells, differences in TGFB1 responses observed between the cell line and purified gonadotropes do not appear to be attributable to differences in <italic>Tgfbr2 </italic>expression. Instead, the mechanisms through which TGFB1 inhibits <italic>Fshb </italic>expression in gonadotropes may be absent from L&#x003b2;T2 cells.</p><p>The identity of these inhibitory mechanisms is currently unknown, though opposing actions of activin A and TGFB1 have been noted in other cellular contexts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>]. Also, TGFB1 can inhibit its own prototypic signaling via TGFBR1 and Smad2/3, through an ACVRL1 (ALK1)-dependent pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>]. That is, in addition to complexes containing two TGFBR2 and two TGFBR1 molecules, TGFB1 can form complexes with two TGFBR2, and one molecule each of TGFBR1 and ALK1. These latter receptor complexes can stimulate Smad1/5 phosphorylation and thereby inhibit TGFB1 actions mediated via TGFBR1 and Smad2/3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>]. Whether or not L&#x003b2;T2 and/or gonadotropes express ALK1 has not been reported. However, it is possible that ALK1 expression in gonadotropes, but not L&#x003b2;T2 cells, may provide a mechanism for TGFB1 to antagonize endogenous activin B-dependent signaling (via Smad2/3) and hence decrease <italic>Fshb </italic>mRNA levels.</p><p>Although gonadotropes were purified to near homogeneity, it is possible that the inhibitory effects of TGFB1 were mediated indirectly through ligand action on contaminating cells in the cultures. For example, TGFB1 might stimulate FST synthesis by folliculostellate cells, which would then suppress the actions of endogenous activin B in gonadotropes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>]. However, if this were the mechanism of TGFB1 action, one might have anticipated greater inhibitory effects in the mixed rather than purified cultures where there are more folliculostellate cells, but the opposite was actually the case. That is, TGFB1 had greater suppressive activity in purified gonadotropes than in mixed cultures. Moreover, because activins stimulate FST production in primary pituitary cultures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>], one would predict that activin A would be less potent in stimulating <italic>Fshb </italic>mRNA levels in mixed than in purified cultures and this was in fact what we observed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). Collectively, these data suggest that the effects of TGFB1 on <italic>Fshb </italic>mRNA levels are likely not mediated via regulation of FST production, though we cannot rule out that possibility entirely.</p><p>The finding that TGFB1 inhibited <italic>Fshb </italic>expression in primary murine gonadotropes and mixed pituitary cultures is novel, and appears to contrast with data reported previously for the rat and sheep <italic>Fshb </italic>genes. For example, TGFB was shown to potently and dose-dependently stimulate FSH secretion from rat primary pituitary culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>]. However, the TGFB preparation used in that study, which was purified from human platelets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>], did not function similarly to recombinant TGFB1 in similar assays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>]. Subsequent reports have failed to show major effects of TGFB1 on FSH in any dispersed pituitary culture. For example, TGFB1 did not affect ovine <italic>Fshb </italic>promoter-reporter activity in transgenic mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>] or FSH secretion from rat primary pituitary cultures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. In addition, only minor stimulation was observed in primary ovine pituitary cultures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>].</p><p>Finally, it is also notable that we observed age-dependent increases in <italic>Tgfbr2 </italic>mRNA levels in purified gonadotropes. These data suggest that as mice mature, their gonadotropes may become more sensitive to the effects of TGFBs. The physiological significance, if any, of this change in receptor expression is not yet known, but is the subject of ongoing investigations. These data are nonetheless important in that they suggest that the low levels <italic>Tgfbr2 </italic>mRNA detected in gonadotropes from young mice are likely not due to contamination by other cell types. Instead, it appears that as gonadotropes age, the level of <italic>Tgfbr2 </italic>expression increases. Consistent with this notion is the lack of this receptor in L&#x003b2;T2 cells, which are thought to represent gonadotropes at an early stage of development. However, L&#x003b2;T2 cells were derived from a female mouse and the purified gonadotropes examined here were all from male mice, so it is possible that differences in <italic>Tgfbr2 </italic>mRNA levels may also reflect sex differences in receptor expression.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The data reported here show that immortalized L&#x003b2;T2 cells lack the TGFB type II receptor, Tgfbr2, whereas the receptor appears to be expressed and functional in gonadotropes from male mice. As a result, TGFB1 (and likely all TGFB isoforms) is unable to regulate <italic>Fshb </italic>in L&#x003b2;T2 cells, but can <underline>inhibit</underline> transcription in primary murine gonadotropes. Because activins and TGFBs similarly activate Smads and TAK1, and both pathways contribute to activin A's stimulation of <italic>Fshb </italic>in rodents, it is surprising that TGFB would produce opposite effects to those of activins in purified gonadotropes. Nonetheless, as predicted, gonadotropes have evolved mechanisms for discriminating between the two classes of ligands. In the future, it will be critical to determine the mechanisms through which TGFBs inhibit <italic>Fshb </italic>in gonadotropes, particularly as animals age and <italic>Tgfbr2 </italic>expression increases. Importantly, the data presented here suggest that L&#x003b2;T2 cells may not provide the best model system in which to pursue this aspect of FSH regulation.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>AJG participated in the design of the study, performed all of the gonadotrope purification and real-time RT-PCR analyses, and drafted portions of the manuscript.
