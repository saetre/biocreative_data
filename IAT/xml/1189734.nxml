To expand our knowledge of DNA damage, we assayed the effects of 12 closely related DNA-damaging agents on the complete pool of ~4,700 barcoded homozygous deletion strains of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>. In our protocol, deletion strains are pooled together and grown competitively in the presence of compound. Relative strain sensitivity is determined by hybridization of PCR-amplified barcodes to an oligonucleotide array carrying the barcode complements. These screens identified genes in well-characterized DNA-damage-response pathways as well as genes whose role in the DNA-damage response had not been previously established. High-throughput individual growth analysis was used to independently confirm microarray results. Each compound produced a unique genome-wide profile. Analysis of these data allowed us to determine the relative importance of DNA-repair modules for resistance to each of the 12 profiled compounds. Clustering the data for 12 distinct compounds uncovered both known and novel functional interactions that comprise the DNA-damage response and allowed us to define the genetic determinants required for repair of interstrand cross-links. Further genetic analysis allowed determination of epistasis for one of these functional groups.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="synopsis"><title>Synopsis</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>Cells have evolved sophisticated ways to respond to DNA damage. This is critical because unrepaired damage can kill cells or cause them to become cancerous. The response to DNA damage has been studied for more than 50 years, and has been found to be extremely complex. The traditional way of understanding this complexity is to divide the process into its component parts with the goal of eventually reconstituting the entire process. In this study, the authors extend classical approaches using genomics&#x02014;an approach that involves studying all genes in an organism simultaneously. The authors tested 12 distinct compounds (many used in cancer chemotherapy) that damage DNA and uncovered new genes involved in DNA repair. They then grouped the compounds to define how they attack cells. Using this approach, the study found that many similar DNA-damaging agents act in comparable ways to damage DNA, but surprisingly, similar compounds can also act on cells by very different mechanisms. Specifically grouping the findings together and verifying the significant results lends a high degree of confidence in the data. The development of such a reproducible experimental design is important for inspiring future experiments.</p></sec></abstract><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>Citation:</meta-name><meta-value>Lee W, St. Onge RP, Proctor M, Flaherty P, Jordan MI, et al.

Fitness analysis of individual deletion strains identified in these global experiments confirmed our microarray data and revealed that the genetic requirements for resistance to DNA-damaging agents may exceed previous estimates. We discovered that those strains sensitive to these compounds carried deletions primarily in genes known to be involved in DNA metabolism, but we also uncovered genes not previously known to be related to the DDR. While resistance to a given compound typically required multiple DDR modules, we found that the relative importance of these modules was varied, even when comparing functionally related compounds. The significance of our results are 4-fold: (1) we developed a robust exportable assay to identify and confirm DDR components; (2) filtering and clustering the data allowed classification of both the mechanism of drug action and gene function; (3) we used epistasis analysis to identify novel functional relationships between DDR components; and (4) we were able to clearly discriminate the genome-wide response to agents that damage DNA by forming interstrand cross-links (ICLs) from those that do not.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Fitness Profiling of the Yeast Deletion Collection</title><p>The yeast deletion collection is a powerful tool for identifying genes important for fitness on a genome-wide scale under a diverse set of environmental conditions &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010024-b13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010024-b16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010024-b20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010024-b22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010024-b24">24</xref>&#x0005d;.

Each of these studies has provided new insights into the DDR. The underlying protocols in these well-executed studies are, however, so disparate that they preclude any direct comparisons beyond general conclusions. For example, some studies were performed on solid media, while others used high doses of compound followed by recovery in liquid media. Furthermore, the data analysis varies from study to study. To provide a consistent and comprehensive dataset of the DDR, we (1) profiled 12 unique DNA-damaging compounds (six of which had not previously been profiled) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0010024-t001">Table 1</xref>) using a validated protocol &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010024-b22">22</xref>&#x0005d;; (2) confirmed a subset of our microarray fitness data by individual strain analysis; and (3) where possible, correlated our results with previously published studies. Specifically, we sought to detect mechanistic differences between compounds that form ICLs (cisplatin, oxaliplatin, carboplatin, mechlorethamine, mitomycin C, and psoralen) and those that do not (angelicin, 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide &#x0005b;4-NQO&#x0005d;, 2-dimethylaminoethyl chloride &#x0005b;2-DMAEC&#x0005d;, methyl methanesulfonate &#x0005b;MMS&#x0005d;, streptozotocin, and camptothecin).</p><p>In our experiments, ~4,700 homozygous diploid deletion mutants were grown in pooled cultures in the presence of compound. Cells were then collected, genomic DNA purified, and the unique molecular barcodes present in each strain amplified by PCR and hybridized to an oligonucleotide array carrying the barcode complements. The relative fitness of each strain was then determined by comparing the signal intensity for each strain on the microarray to the corresponding intensities obtained from a series of no-drug control arrays (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0010024-sd001">Dataset S1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0010024-sd006">Protocol S1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Validating the Approach by Individual Strain Confirmation</title><p>Little experimental evidence directly addresses how well fitness defects or sensitivities measured by microarray analysis correlate with actual growth rates of individually cultured strains. To directly address this issue, we cultured the 233 deletion strains most sensitive to mechlorethamine individually (as determined from three replicate microarray experiments, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). The individual growth rates of these strains were measured, both in the presence and absence of mechlorethamine, by taking optical-density readings of liquid cultures every 15 min for 30 h (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0010024-sd002">Dataset S2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0010024-sd007">Protocol S2</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010024-g001">Figure 1</xref>A shows representative growth curves for 32 of these cultures (16 in dimethyl sulfoxide &#x0005b;DMSO, diluent control&#x0005d; and 16 in mechlorethamine). We defined the sensitivity to mechlorethamine of each strain by calculating the difference between the average doubling time (AvgG) in DMSO and in mechlorethamine (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). These values were then normalized to wild-type and plotted against their corresponding fitness-defect scores as measured from the microarray (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010024-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). We observed a highly significant correlation (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> &#x0003d; 0.5086, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 8.5e&#x02212;38; data not shown). When we removed strains exhibiting fitness defects in the absence of drug from the analysis, this correlation increased (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> &#x0003d; 0.7462; <italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 5.4e&#x02212;57). This is consistent with slow-growing strains yielding artificially low fitness-defect scores in microarray-based fitness analysis of pooled cultures (see Overall Experimental Design). Of 233 individual strains analyzed, 206 exhibited significant mechlorethamine-dependent fitness defects compared to that of a wild-type strain (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>).</p><p>To further test how well our significance calling in our microarray experiments correlated with individual growth rates, we compared a calculated false-discovery rate (FDR) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010024-b28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010024-b29">29</xref>&#x0005d; with a measured FDR for the top 81 most sensitive strains according to the combined results for pooled growth in mechlorethamine (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0010024-t002">Table 2</xref>). The FDR calculation allows us to establish a fitness-defect score threshold for a given acceptable rate of false discovery. Specifically, we calculated the cut-off for several FDRs and examined the individual growth curves of strains that were designated as significant at these cut-offs. For example, the array results show that a 5&#x00025; FDR cut-off results in 37 sensitive strains from the pooled experiments. The individual growth curves of these 37 strains reveal that 35 of them are indeed sensitive to mechlorethamine, giving us a 5.4&#x00025; FDR (two out of 37). For this drug, our measured FDR is lower than the calculated FDR. It should be noted that although the above underscores the low FDR in our experiments, it can not address the extent of the false-negative rate.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Overall Experimental Design</title><p>As we refined our assay for the DNA-damaging agents, it became apparent that the length of time for which cells are exposed to compound has a dramatic effect on the sensitivity of deletion strains lacking those genes most required for growth. Specifically, in our standard assay design, frozen aliquots of the deletion collection are recovered in rich media for ten generations until they reach logarithmic growth phase &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010024-b22">22</xref>&#x0005d;. Compound is then added and the culture is robotically grown for precisely 20 generations. This prolonged chronic exposure allows for detection of those gene products that are required for resistance even for those gene products that have small (&#x0003c;5&#x00025;) growth defects. We used this standard assay to profile four compounds: mechlorethamine, cisplatin, streptozotocin, and camptothecin. The results of these experiments made it clear that any deletion strain exhibiting a slow-growth phenotype in the absence of compound becomes depleted from the pool even before the compound is applied. As a consequence, this experimental design precludes any meaningful measure of the fitness of this subset of strains. To circumvent this problem, we altered our experimental protocol in the following way: frozen pool aliquots were thawed and immediately exposed to compound for the equivalent of five generations of wild-type growth.</p><p>Control experiments showed no non-specific sensitivity of the wild-type strain as a result of cells recovering from a frozen state using this protocol (data not shown). This revised experimental design was used to screen the 12 compounds (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0010024-t001">Table 1</xref>) because (1) this low number of generations minimizes the false-negative rate resulting from slow-growing strains; and (2) these experiments should identify gene products immediately required for resistance to compound. The advantages of this design are demonstrated by examining the <italic>rad51&#x00394;</italic> and <italic>rad52&#x00394;</italic> homozygous deletion strains, both of which are defective for homologous recombination-mediated repair &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010024-b30">30</xref>&#x0005d;. Both are acutely sensitive to mechlorethamine but also exhibit a slow-growth phenotype in the absence of mechlorethamine (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010024-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). In the standard 20-generation assay, however, the fitness-defect scores of these deletion strains in mechlorethamine ranked 1,676 and 2,051, respectively, among the other ~4,700 strains in the pool (where the strain most sensitive to mechlorethamine has a rank of 1). When the revised experimental design was used, the average rank of these strains increased to 21 and 23, respectively. Therefore, in the former case, neither strain was sensitive, but in the latter case, both were extremely sensitive.</p><p>Despite our observation that the shorter-generation assay detected many DDR genes, comparing the five-generation assay with the standard 20-generation assay yielded additional insight. For example, there is an increase in strains that are deleted for genes classified as &#x0201c;other&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;unknown&#x0201d; that exhibit fitness defects only after extended exposure (i.e. 20 generations) to compound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010024-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). Particularly interesting examples are strains defective in DNA-damage checkpoints. <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0010024-t003">Table 3</xref> summarizes the average rank of five checkpoint-defective strains <italic>(rad9&#x00394;, rad24&#x00394;, rad17&#x00394;, ddc1&#x00394;,</italic> and <italic>mec3&#x00394;)</italic> following five or 20 generations of pool growth in 500 &#x003bc;M cisplatin. We followed up on this result by monitoring the growth rate of these individual strains during the first five and second five generations of growth in cisplatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010024-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). Strikingly, both the <italic>rad9&#x00394;</italic> and <italic>rad24&#x00394;</italic> strains exhibited accelerated growth relative to wild-type during the first five generations, consistent with a lack of checkpoint-mediated cell-cycle arrest &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010024-b31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010024-b32">32</xref>&#x0005d;. Despite this accelerated growth, these strains exhibited reduced viability even at the five-generation point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010024-g002">Figure 2</xref>C). Consistent with this observation during the next five generations (6&#x02013;10), these mutants did exhibit a reduced rate of growth, presumably due to the accumulation of DNA and chromosomal damage associated with uncontrolled progression through the cell cycle. Notably, the growth rate of deletion strains <italic>rad17&#x00394;, ddc1&#x00394;,</italic> and <italic>mec3&#x00394;,</italic> whose protein products form a complex loaded onto DNA at sites of damage in a <italic>RAD24</italic>-dependent manner &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010024-b33">33</xref>&#x0005d;, were indistinguishable from that of a <italic>rad24&#x00394;</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010024-g002">Figure 2</xref>C; data not shown). These results may explain the discrepancy between conflicting reports that address the requirement of checkpoint genes for resistance to cisplatin &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010024-b18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010024-b34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010024-b35">35</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>In addition to checkpoint-defective strains, a number of other deletion strains exhibited sensitivity only after 20 generations of growth. These strains, however, do not exhibit accelerated growth at five generations but appear to be required only after long-term chronic exposure. These strains are deleted for genes that modify chromatin structure and are involved in the respiratory chain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0010024-st001">Table S1</xref>). Despite the lack of an observable growth defect at five generations, we hypothesized that some of these strains, depending on the cause of their sensitivity, may have reduced viability. To test this, we plated serial dilutions of individual strains (that exhibited sensitivity after 20 generations, but not after five generations) on yeast extract/peptone/dextrose (YPD) following five generations of growth in 500 &#x003bc;M cisplatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010024-g002">Figure 2</xref>C). Of the four we tested, <italic>gcs1&#x00394;, swi4&#x00394;, rtf1&#x00394;,</italic> and <italic>yme1&#x00394;,</italic> none showed an increased loss of viability. Liquid cultures of these strains confirmed these results, as a decrease in growth rate compared to wild-type is only observed at later-generation time points, and is not observed at the five-generation time point.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Interstrand DNA Cross-Linkers</title><p>In this study, we examined the effects of a variety of DNA-damaging agents, but placed particular emphasis on compounds that induce cross-links between complementary strands of DNA (the ICLs). Even though each of the six ICL-inducing compounds we profiled cause a variety of structural damage to DNA (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0010024-t001">Table 1</xref>), the cytotoxic effects of these compounds are attributed primarily to ICLs &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010024-b36">36</xref>&#x0005d;.

Although the genes that make up these modules are somewhat arbitrarily assigned, we believe that they are generally acceptable in the DNA-damage community and, moreover, provide a simple visual depiction of some of the important differences between compounds. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010024-g003">Figure 3</xref> provides only an overview (for more detail, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s5">Supporting Information</xref>). Examining the top 30 sensitive strains for a given compound and the relative sensitivity rankings for these strains gives a snapshot of the first line of defense against the damage induced by that compound. The gene groups with the lowest ranks contain genes that, when deleted, result in the greatest sensitivity to that drug and therefore are presumably most important in conferring resistance. Extending this list to the top 250 sensitive strains then begins to show a more general view of other DDR pathways that are also involved in responding to damage caused by that agent.</p><p>The genes from these pathways are also important for resistance to additional types of DNA damage, as is evidenced by the profiles of other compounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010024-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Therefore, their sensitivity to cross-linking agents could be due to a combined deficiency in the repair of ICLs as well as other DNA lesions. To identify strains whose sensitivity was entirely due to a lack of ICL repair, we screened the compounds angelicin and 2-DMAEC, monofunctional analogues of psoralen and mechlorethamine, respectively. The most striking difference between these profiles was the relative sensitivity of the <italic>pso2&#x00394;</italic> deletion strain, which ranked among the most sensitive strains in psoralen and mechlorethamine (and indeed all other cross-linking compounds), but which exhibited no detectable sensitivity to angelicin or 2-DMAEC. These observations are consistent with previous findings for <italic>PSO2</italic> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010024-b41">41</xref>&#x0005d;, whose protein product is thought to facilitate the repair of ICLs as a part of the NER pathway &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010024-b40">40</xref>&#x0005d;. Further comparisons between ICL and non-ICL-inducing compounds underscored the importance of translesion DNA synthesis (TLS) to the repair of ICLs. This is consistent with previous findings for <italic>REV1, REV3,</italic> and <italic>REV7,</italic> which operate in a branch of PRR &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010024-b42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010024-b43">43</xref>&#x0005d;.

Generally speaking, however, with respect to well-characterized DNA-damage-responsive pathways, there was a high level of correlation between the genetic requirements for resistance among the ICL-inducing compounds that we profiled. There were, however, some exceptions to this. Genes encoding the MRX complex <italic>(MRE11, RAD50,</italic> and <italic>XRS2),</italic> involved in the repair of DNA double-strand breaks &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010024-b45">45</xref>&#x0005d;, were particularly important for resistance to mechlorethamine (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s5">Supporting Information</xref>). Strains deleted for the genes <italic>MUS81</italic> and <italic>MMS4,</italic> whose protein products are thought to form a structure-specific endonuclease important for restarting stalled replication forks &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010024-b46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010024-b47">47</xref>&#x0005d;, were highly sensitive to each cross-linker with the exception of psoralen. Finally, resistance to carboplatin appeared less dependent on NER machinery when compared to other cross-linkers, including other members of the platinum family. This is surprising because the mechanism of action and the spectrum of clinical activity of cisplatin and carboplatin are more similar to each other than to oxaliplatin &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010024-b48">48</xref>&#x0005d;.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Non-Cross-Linking DNA-Damaging Agents</title><p>We also profiled five compounds that covalently modify DNA but do not induce ICLs. These included the aforementioned angelicin and 2-DMAEC, as well as streptozotocin, MMS, and 4-NQO. Streptozotocin and MMS are both clinically used cytotoxics that methylate DNA primarily at the N-7 position of guanine residues.

This likely reflects a common ability of these compounds to cause lesions that impede the advancement of DNA-replication forks during S-phase. There were also several differences in the five fitness profiles. To remove DNA adducts, the cell can employ one of several excision-repair mechanisms, the selection of which is based on the size of the offending DNA adduct &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010024-b52">52</xref>&#x0005d;. In agreement with this, we found that NER was important for resistance to compounds that cause bulkier DNA adducts (angelicin and 4-NQO), whereas <italic>MAG1,</italic> encoding a DNA glycosylase of base excision repair &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010024-b53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010024-b54">54</xref>&#x0005d;, was important for resistance to the methylating activities of streptozotocin and MMS. Interestingly, <italic>MAG1</italic> appeared to be more important for resistance to MMS than to streptozotocin, based on rank.</p><p>A sixth non-cross-linking agent profiled, camptothecin, is distinct from the other compounds in this study because it inhibits the activity of an enzyme rather than directly modifying DNA.

During replication, collision of the replication machinery with this protein&#x02013;DNA complex causes double-strand breaks. Our assay revealed a unique sensitivity profile for camptothecin. Strains deficient in the <italic>MUS81</italic>/<italic>MMS4</italic> complex and HRR showed the greatest sensitivity to camptothecin, as expected for a treatment that induces stalled replication forks. Neither PRR nor excision-repair mechanisms appeared to play a prominent role in conferring resistance to camptothecin.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Uncharacterized Genes</title><p>Of the 36 array experiments examined in this study, 283 strains scored significantly sensitive in at least one experiment when a 5&#x00025; FDR threshold was used. Among these 283 strains, 87 are sensitive in three or more independent experiments and four of these strains contain deletions in unnamed genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0010024-st002">Table S2</xref>). The most notable of these four strains is <italic>YDR291W,</italic> a gene encoding a putative DNA helicase that appears to be involved in repairing mechlorethamine-induced lesions.

An equally important factor is the finding that many of the named genes do not properly reflect the complexity of their cellular roles. Specifically, many of the sensitive strains that carry three-letter names are poorly characterized and, more importantly, their roles in the DDR are largely unknown. For example, the <italic>RMD7</italic> mutant appears sensitive to several cross-linking compounds yet is named for being required for meiotic division &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010024-b60">60</xref>&#x0005d;.

Our results provide functional data that these genes are in fact involved in the DDR and suggest additional experiments to further characterize them.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Global Analysis</title><p>To analyze the 36 array experiments presented here in a global manner, we applied hierarchical clustering techniques to the fitness-defect scores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010024-g004">Figure 4</xref>A). The dataset used for clustering was restricted to strains designated as significant (5&#x00025; FDR) in two or more of the array experiments, and thus represented only the most highly sensitive strains identified in this study. This produced a matrix of fitness-defect scores (141 strains &#x000d7; 36 experiments). An examination of the clusters across the experiment axis showed that, as expected, compounds predicted to have similar mechanisms of action group together, lending confidence in the robustness of the analysis. Members of the platinum family of compounds are highly correlated, as are MMS and streptozotocin, the only two agents profiled that possess DNA-methylating activity. The genome-wide data was highly reproducible, evidenced by the fact that all replicates correlate as nearest neighbors.</p><p>When the clustered results are viewed along the gene axis, we predicted there would be a high correlation in fitness profiles between strains with deficiencies in genes in the same DNA-repair pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010024-g004">Figure 4</xref>B), and this prediction was confirmed. This result holds true for several DNA-repair epistasis groups, including NER, PRR, HRR, error-prone TLS, and cell-cycle checkpoint control (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010024-g004">Figure 4</xref>A).</p><p>The clustering analysis suggested additional novel functional interactions. We focused on one particular cluster within the dataset that included five genes: <italic>MPH1, SHU1, SHU2, CSM2,</italic> and <italic>PSY3</italic>. The latter four genes encode proteins that physically interact with one another and belong to a single epistasis group that appears to operate in a branch of HRR &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010024-b64">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010024-b65">65</xref>&#x0005d;. <italic>MPH1</italic> was also shown to be epistatic with members of the HRR pathway &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010024-b66">66</xref>&#x0005d;, and the Mph1 protein, as predicted by its amino acid sequence, was recently shown to possess DNA helicase activity &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010024-b67">67</xref>&#x0005d;. To our knowledge, however, no direct functional link between <italic>MPH1</italic> and the other four genes has been reported. To test whether such a link exists, as suggested by our clustering analysis, we generated double mutants between <italic>MPH1</italic> and each of the other four genes and measured the sensitivity of these strains to MMS. We found that single and double deletion strains exhibited similar sensitivity to MMS, indicating that <italic>MPH1</italic> is epistatic with <italic>SHU1, SHU2, CSM2,</italic> and <italic>PSY3</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010024-g004">Figure 4</xref>C). Conversely, the addition of an <italic>MPH1</italic> deletion to strains carrying deletions known to compromise other defined DNA-damage pathways, such as <italic>MUS81</italic> (stalled replication-fork repair) and <italic>MAG1</italic> (base excision repair), exacerbated the sensitivity to MMS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010024-g004">Figure 4</xref>C).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>The high level of scrutiny paid to the DDR in yeast and other model organisms has yielded a wealth of data. In this study, we set out to address two aims. First, we sought to collect a sufficient number of fitness-profile signatures for compounds with similar mechanisms of action. This would allow us to test whether we could identify differences in compound profiles that might provide correlative insight into their diverse clinical efficacy. Second, we aimed to develop a standard assay platform, including all protocols and strains so that they can be exported to any laboratory. We believe that such a standard set of protocols will provide a powerful resource to the entire community and will allow for the development of a centralized database for the exchange of information.</p><p>While classical forward genetic screens in yeast have been instrumental in identifying important components of the DDR, it is unlikely that saturation across the genome has been achieved. In contrast to traditional genetic analysis, the approach employed here enabled the systematic interrogation of the comprehensive set of all 4,758 homozygous deletion strains, representing nearly all non-essential genes in the yeast genome. Furthermore, because the fitness-defect scores obtained with this method display a continuous range of sensitivity and these sensitivities correlate well with independently measured growth rates (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010024-g001">Figure 1</xref>B), genes can be ranked according to their relative importance in conferring resistance to a given compound. This provides a high level of resolution and allows distinctions to be made between functionally related compounds, even in cases where the genetic elements required for fitness largely overlap. For example, cisplatin, oxaliplatin, and carboplatin are structurally related chemotherapeutic drugs and, for each, their cytotoxicity is attributed primarily to their ability to induce ICLs. Predictably, fitness profiling of each compound identified the major pathways important for resistance to DNA cross-linking agents (<italic>PSO2</italic>/NER, HRR, and PRR). The fitness profile for carboplatin, however, was unique among the platinum-based compounds in that PRR was found to hold far greater importance in conferring resistance than the other pathways (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010024-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Carboplatin's distinctive profile is also apparent upon hierarchical clustering of the data (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010024-g004">Figure 4</xref>A), and could potentially reflect differences in the spectrum of structural damage to DNA or in cell-cycle-specific reactivity of the drug.</p><p>Although DNA-targeting drugs are typically viewed as non-specific, the cellular response to both diverse and functionally similar DNA-damaging agents is clearly distinct as is evidenced by their specific clinical applications &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010024-b68">68</xref>&#x0005d;. It is important to note that most of these agents were used before their mechanism of action had been defined, and their effectiveness is still defined empirically. Given this fact and the fact that DNA will remain an excellent therapeutic oncology target, particularly as more selective and less toxic compounds are developed, high-throughput assays capable of defining drug action will undoubtedly prove useful. In this study, we used 12 compound profiles (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0010024-t001">Table 1</xref>) to define a benchmark from which the application of this assay to novel DNA-damaging compounds can be compared.</p><p>Because the measured sensitivity of each strain in a given profile is a continuum of sensitivity as measured by growth inhibition, it is difficult to gauge the point at which fitness-defect scores cease to reflect significant defects in growth. We therefore sought to confirm the sensitivity detected in competitive pools by growing individual strains &#x0002b;/&#x02212; the compound mechlorethamine. We found that 88&#x00025; of the 233 strains most sensitive to mechlorethamine (based on rank) were also found to be sensitive in our individual growth assay (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0010024-t002">Table 2</xref>). Thus, our assay has the advantage of having a measurable FDR that appears much lower than our calculated FDR &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010024-b69">69</xref>&#x0005d;. This result is significant on several levels. First, we found 34 uncharacterized genes suggesting, as predicted, that our understanding of the DDR is still incomplete. Second, these results suggest that by choosing a stringent significance cut-off, we have likely missed other DDR genes, and the raw data from these screens should provide a rich data source for further analysis. Added to this complexity is our observation that several strains exhibit compound sensitivity only following extended drug exposure. By conducting our assay for both five and 20 generations of growth, we have gleaned a more comprehensive representation of the DDR. This enabled us to establish definitively a role for five checkpoint genes in conferring resistance to cisplatin (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0010024-g002">Figure 2</xref>)&#x02014;an observation for which there has been no consensus in the literature.</p><p>Our assay is distinct from expression studies, where an equivalent confirmation assay would represent hundreds of Northern blots or quantitative PCR assays to verify expression changes. In addition, expression arrays do not allow a ranking of genes as it is not clear how or if the magnitude of expression change is biologically significant. The fact that our assay allows a ranking of sensitivities, and confirmation of this ranking, makes it distinct from several colony-based studies using the yeast deletion collection. These solid-media assays for sensitivity are not highly quantitative, though spot-dilution confirmation does allow some measure of relative sensitivities.</p><p>In summary, despite significant advances in the breadth and depth of our understanding of the DDR, additional cell-based analyses are required before we can claim to fully understand DNA replication, recombination, and repair &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010024-b70">70</xref>&#x0005d;. We believe that a new theme has emerged in these studies, however, in that the combined use of chemicals with genetic deletions can define functional groups that, in the absence of compound, would not be uncovered. For example, hierarchical clustering of the most highly sensitive strains identified using a combination of chemical and genetic perturbations successfully predicted novel epistatic interactions between the <italic>MPH1</italic> gene and <italic>SHU1, SHU2, CSM2,</italic> and <italic>PSY3</italic>. Even though they comprise a major defense mechanism against several DNA-damaging agents, a role for these five gene products in a branch of HRR is only now beginning to emerge &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010024-b65">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010024-b66">66</xref>&#x0005d;. Further analysis of this dataset will undoubtedly uncover additional functional relationships whose discovery has thus far remained elusive. Finally, increased use (and increased availability) of chemical inhibitors to probe the yeast deletion collection should provide a more comprehensive, contextual understanding of cellular physiology.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Reagents.</title><p>Cisplatin, carboplatin, oxaliplatin, psoralen, angelicin, streptozotocin, 2-DMAEC, mechlorethamine, MMS, camptothecin, and 4-NQO were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, Missouri, United States).

These scores are based on a tag-specific algorithm that takes into account the intensities of each tag on the experimental array and the corresponding intensities on a set of control arrays performed on the pool without compound (the control set). The majority of strains carry four tags that hybridize to the array: upstream tag (uptag), uptag antisense, downstream tag (dntag), and dntag antisense. The tag intensities are log transformed, mean normalized, and the intensities of the two strands of each tag are averaged into a single value for each tag. Next, a mean and standard deviation are calculated for the uptag and dntag intensities for each strain across the set of control arrays. A <italic>z</italic>-score for upstream and downstream tags for each strain is then calculated by taking the difference of the average intensities between the control and treatment and dividing by the standard deviation of the control-set intensities. The result is two <italic>z</italic>-score values for the upstream and downstream tags; these are then averaged into a single fitness-defect score for the strain. A significance cut-off for each experiment was determined by calculating the score cut-off required for a 0.05 FDR &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010024-b28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0010024-b29">29</xref>&#x0005d;.</p></sec><sec id="s4f"><title>Clustering analysis.</title><p>Hierarchical clustering analysis was performed with Cluster 3.0 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bonsai.ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~mdehoon/software/cluster/software.htm">http://bonsai.ims.u-tokyo.ac.jp/~mdehoon/software/cluster/software.htm</ext-link>) in Windows and Linux and visualized using Java Treeview (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://jtreeview.sourceforge.net/">http://jtreeview.sourceforge.net/</ext-link>) and slcview (http://slcview.stanford.edu).

Cells were then diluted to an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.02 in a final volume of 100 &#x003bc;l using a Biomek FX Laboratory Automation Workstation (Beckman Coulter, Allendale, New Jersey, United States). Normalized cultures were grown in 96-well plates (Nunc, Rochester, New York, United States) in Tecan GENios microplate readers (Tecan) for up to 30 h. The growth rate of each culture was monitored by measuring the OD<sub>600</sub> every 15 min and calculating the average doubling time (AvgG). AvgG was calculated by recording the time (&#x00394;<italic>t</italic>) from the start of growth until the optical density of the culture reached the calibrated five-generation point (OD5g) and dividing this by the number of generations, i.e., five. If the culture did not reach OD5g, AvgG was calculated by using a binomial search to determine the fractional generations of the optical density at the end of the growth (ODf), assuming an exponential growth rate, then dividing the time to ODf by the generations calculated.</p><p>We defined the sensitivity to mechlorethamine of each individual strain as the difference between the AvgG in mechlorethamine and in DMSO (&#x00394;AvgG &#x0003d; AvgG<sub>mech</sub> &#x02212; AvgG<sub>DMSO</sub>).
