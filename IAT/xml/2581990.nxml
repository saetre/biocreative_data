To this, we recently added innate-type lymphocyte repopulation as being central for restoring postinflammation tissue homeostasis with a role in controlling innate immune&#x02013;mediated responses to secondary infection. However, although macrophages dominate resolution, their phenotype and role in restoring tissue physiology once inflammation abates are unknown. Therefore, we isolated macrophages from the resolving phase of acute inflammation and found that compared with classically activated proinflammatory M1 cells, resolution-phase macrophages (rMs) possess weaker bactericidal properties and express an alternatively activated phenotype but with elevated markers of M1 cells including inducible cyclooxygenase (COX 2) and nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). This phenotype is controlled by cAMP, which, when inhibited, transforms rM to M1 cells. Conversely, elevating cAMP in M1 cells transforms them to rMs, with implications for cAMP in the resolution of systemic inflammation. It transpires that although rMs are dispensable for clearing PMNs during self-limiting inflammation, they are essential for signaling postresolution lymphocyte repopulation via COX 2 lipids. Thus, rM macrophages are neither classically nor alternatively activated but a hybrid of both, with a role in mediating postresolution innate-lymphocyte repopulation and restoring tissue homeostasis.</p></abstract><contract-sponsor id="CS200" xlink:href="http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/">Wellcome Trust</contract-sponsor></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Macrophages possess a plasticity of phenotype that explains their protective as well as potentially detrimental role in chronic inflammation and tissue injury.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref></sup> Such heterogeneity arises as macrophages differentiate from monocytes and are exposed to specific tissue- and hematopoietic cell&#x02013;derived stimuli. Macrophages are classified as either alternatively or classically activated. The &#x0201c;classical activation&#x0201d; (M1) profile occurs in a type 1 cytokine environment (IFN&#x003b3;, TNF&#x003b1;) or upon recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref></sup> Thus, M1 cells play an important role in protection against pathogens by producing high levels of TNF&#x003b1;, IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-6, and IL-12, for instance, and low levels of IL-10 and are therefore promoters of Th1-type immune responses.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref></sup> In addition, these cells express high levels of COX 2 and exert antiproliferative and cytotoxic activities resulting partly from reactive nitrogen and oxygen species including iNOS-derived NO, peroxynitrite, hydrogen peroxide, and superoxide.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref></sup> Although such short-term inflammatory activity is beneficial to the host in the terms of combating infection, the persistence of proinflammatory processes may results in tissue damage. Therefore, inflammation is counterbalanced by endogenous protective signals including Th2 cytokines (IL-10, IL-4, and IL-13) and apoptotic cells,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref></sup> resulting in the development of an anti-inflammatory or &#x0201c;alternatively activated&#x0201d; macrophage phenotype.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref></sup> Although exhibiting broad heterogeneity, such M2 cells express mannose receptors and secrete high levels of immunosuppressive IL-10 and TGF&#x003b2;1 compared with M1 cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref></sup><sup>.</sup></p><p>Innate immune responses are characterized by the initial influx of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) followed by monocyte-derived macrophages, leading to resolution followed by injured tissues returning to normal physiology.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8"/><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref></sup> Although a great deal is known about the properties of early release cytokines and chemokines and their mechanisms of action that drive inflammation, we are still trying to understand more about the soluble mediators and cellular players that trigger resolution and restoration of tissue homeostasis. To this end, we recently identified innate-type lymphocyte repopulation as being central to restoring tissue normal physiology once inflammation resolves, with a role in controlling responses to secondary infection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref></sup> However, given the predominance of macrophages during resolution, the phenotype of these cells is unknown. Therefore, we set about cataloging the inflammatory status of resolution-phase macrophages and documenting their role in postinflammation tissue homeostasis.</p><p>Therefore, a model of self-limiting peritonitis was established from which macrophages could be isolated from its resolution phase. A model of peritonitis that progressed to systemic inflammation was also established for comparison. Using cytokine arrays and proteomic analysis, we confirmed that the inflammatory environment macrophages occupied during resolution was anti-inflammatory, whereas the cavity of animals that progressed to systemic inflammation expressed proinflammatory cytokines and acute-phase proteins. Macrophage phenotyping revealed that whereas cells from the nonresolving model were M1, resolution-phase macrophages (rMs) were alternatively activated but also expressed high levels of COX 2 as well as iNOS, imparting upon them a hybrid phenotype. These macrophages also differed in their abilities to clear bacterial infection, with M1 cells being superior to rM cells in this regard. The phenotype of macrophage populations was determined by intracellular cAMP, which is elevated in rMs and if inhibited transforms their phenotype to that of M1 cells. It transpires that although rMs are dispensable for PMN clearance, they signal the repopulation of innate-type lymphocytes, one of the critical determinants of successful resolution and tissue homeostasis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref></sup></p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Animal maintenance and induction of peritonitis</title><p>All animals (C57BL6/J) were bred under standard conditions and maintained in a 12-hour light/12-hour dark cycle at 22&#x000b0;C plus or minus 1&#x000b0;C and given food and tap water ad libitum in accordance with United Kingdom Home Office regulations.

Thus, a low dose of 0.1 mg, which triggers a mild and transient inflammation resulting in full recovery, and a higher dose of 10 mg, which results in a more progressive and prolonged response leading to systemic inflammation, were used. The latter dose visibly affected mice, which exhibited hunching, weight loss, and in some cases multiple organ failure consistent with previous publications.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref></sup> Cells were isolated from the inflamed peritoneum of both models and quantified with differential cell counts determined by FACS analysis throughout the response. In low-dose zymosan, PMNs peaked at 8 or 24 hours and cleared thereafter, with macrophages peaking at 72 hours and persisting in the peritoneum for up to 3 weeks after stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A,B). By contrast, in response to high-dose zymosan total PMN and macrophages were considerably higher than in the resolving model peaking at 72 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A,B). Analysis of inflammatory exudates revealed elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in exudates of mice that received 10 mg zymosan up to day 9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C) and in their plasma at day 16 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D), indicative of systemic inflammation. In contrast, cell-free inflammatory exudates of resolving inflammation contained predominantly IL-10 and comparatively little proinflammatory mediators in their plasma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C and D, respectively). Thus, by injecting different levels of an inflammatory irritant, we established a model of resolving peritonitis as well as one that progressed to systemic inflammation. As a result, we propose that this self-limiting model (induced by 0.1 mg zymosan) be used to identify novel endogenous resolution pathways that may be dysregulated or absent in the delayed or nonresolving inflammation.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Cell profile and associated cytokine and chemokine release in resolving inflammation</bold>.

These monocytes differentiated into macrophages (Ly6C<sup>lo</sup> and F4/80<sup>hi</sup>) from 24 hours onward, becoming progressively larger and more granular over time with the degree of differentiation correlating with increased F4/80 expression and reduced Ly6C labeling (Figure S1A,B, available on the <italic>Blood</italic> website; see the Supplemental Figures link at the top of the online article). We next injected the phagocyte-specific label PKH26-PCL<sup>red</sup> intraperitoneally to both models at 24 hours and analyzed samples at 72 hours, the phase of peak macrophage occupancy in these models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). PKH26-PCL<sup>red</sup> has been shown by others to be rapidly phagocytosed and cleared from the inflammatory environment within minutes of injection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref></sup> In confirmatory experiments, we found that PKH26-PCL is cleared within 1 hour by incubating cell-free inflammatory exudates from animals injected with PKH26-PCL with macrophages in vitro and finding that cultured macrophages did not label positively with PKH26-PCL (data not included). Therefore, this method of cell labeling provides a valuable tool with which to determine macrophage trafficking in vivo. The results of these experiments revealed that in resolving inflammation virtually all macrophages stained positively for PKH26-PCL<sup>red</sup>, whereas in the 10-mg zymosan group about half were PKH26-PCL<sup>red</sup> (Figure S1C,D). Taking this further, 12 hours after the initial PKH26-PCL<sup>red</sup> injection animals were also injected with PKH2-PCL<sup>green</sup> intraperitoneally and cells analyzed at 72 hours, the idea being that subsequent influxing macrophages would label positively with PKH2-PCL<sup>green</sup> only. These results confirm that in resolving inflammation very few macrophages were green only, whereas in nonresolving inflammation about 15% were PKH2-PCL<sup>green</sup> positive (Figure S1E,F). Therefore, in resolving inflammation rMs are derived from a common monocyte precursor that had migrated into the peritoneum by 24 hours, whereas in nonresolving inflammation there is a more prolonged influx of monocytes over a broader time frame than when inflammation is self-limiting.</p></sec><sec><title>Distinct macrophage phenotype in a proresolution environment</title><p>Using these models of resolving and nonresolving inflammation, we sought to establish the phenotypes of macrophages taken from a resolving inflammation (0.1 mg zymosan) compared with those taken from a nonresolving or proinflammatory environment (10 mg zymosan). To this end, macrophages from 72 hours were isolated and incubated for 6 hours ex vivo to determine the profile of cytokines and chemokines secreted as well as intracellular proteins they express. As expected, macrophages from 10 mg zymosan produced high levels of TNF&#x003b1;, IL-12p40, as well as MIP-1&#x003b1; and MIP-1&#x003b2;, for instance, along with lower levels of IL-10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). Because of their similarity to classically activate macrophages, these cells will be referred to as M1. On the other hand, macrophages from the resolving inflammatory environment synthesized high levels of anti-inflammatory IL-10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A) as well as iNOS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B), COX 2, the COX 2&#x02013;derived anti-inflammatory lipid mediator PGD<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C), mannose receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>D), along with comparatively higher levels of cAMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>E). These macrophages produced little of the proinflammatory cytokines or chemokines typical of the 10-mg zymosan model. These data suggest that resolving inflammation favors a macrophage phenotype that is neither classically nor alternatively activated but a hybrid of both canonical definitions, referred to as resolving-phase macrophages (rMs).

More importantly, rM's ability to kill bacteria was enhanced by incubation with rp-cAMP (cAMP inhibitor) prior to addition of bacteria. Conversely, the killing ability of proinflammatory macrophages (M1) was reduced by addition of db-cAMP. These findings suggest that modulating macrophage phenotype may alter host ability to combat bacterial infection. To test this hypothesis in vivo, we injected the phosphodiesterase IV inhibitor theophylline at concentrations that elevate cAMP at 72 hours to M1-sufficent, proinflammatory mice (10 mg zymosan). Thirty minutes after theophylline, group B streptococcus was injected intraperitoneally and plasma was taken 3 hours later to determine bacterial load. Theophylline caused an increase in plasma bacterial counts compared with controls and was associated with increased mortality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B,C), showing that converting M1 macrophages to bactericidal-impaired rMs allows for enhanced bacterial colonization and mortality concomitant with elevated cAMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>D). Equivalent data were obtained with rolipram. The results of these experiments suggest that the phenotypic status of inflammatory macrophages may be a critical determinant of host ability to combat postinflammation superinfection and that drugs that elevate cAMP may compromise ability of the innate immune response to kill bacteria.</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Resolution-phase macrophages possess reduced bactericidal properties compared with M1 cells</bold>.

However, rM cells did not trigger resolution in these animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A). Specifically, there was no reduction in total PMNs or macrophages or alterations in lymphocytes numbers (individual cell profile not included). Lymphocytes are pertinent markers of resolution, as we have shown recently that lymphocyte repopulation is critical for postresolution tissue homeostasis.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref></sup> As one explanation for this negative result, transferred PKH26-PCL<sup>red</sup>&#x02013;labeled rMs, when separated from the nonresolving milieu after 24 hours using FACSAria, were found to synthesize more TNF&#x003b1; than native rM cells with little difference in IL-10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B,C). This indicates that despite the robustness of ex vivo stimulation in response to a defined stimulus as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>F,G, the environment of nonresolving inflammation predominated in vivo, transforming rMs toward an M1 phenotype. Similar results were obtained when rolipram and theophylline were administered to mice bearing 10 mg zymosan where cAMP reduced M1 TNF&#x003b1; but had no effect on leukocyte numbers (Figure S2E,F). Thus, although elevating cAMP dampens proinflammatory cytokines with implications for resolution of systemic inflammation, it is insufficient to reduce leukocyte numbers in the peritoneum. We suspect that endogenous mediators, specific to ongoing inflammation, prevail over proresolution signals in terms of regulating cell clearance. Proteomic analysis shed some light on these respective environments, finding several acute-phase proteins including haptoglobin, hemopexin, pregnancy zone protein, and serum amyloid P-component as well as proinflammatory HMGB-1 expressed during ongoing inflammation (Figure S2A-D).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref></sup> In contrast, proteins from resolving inflammation were largely anti-inflammatory, defined by markers of alternatively activated macrophages (arginase I)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref></sup> and proteins involved in antioxidative pathways mediated by glutathione (carbonic anhydrase 3)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref></sup> and interestingly proteins involved in energy metabolism (triosephosphate isomerase,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref></sup> creatine kinase,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref></sup> and sorbitol dehydrogenase<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref></sup>). Thus, although we can alter the phenotype of macrophages with implications for resolution of systemic inflammation, endogenous proinflammatory signals of the type identified by proteomic analysis may control the fate of leukocytes in a manner that is independent of cAMP. In which case, we propose that cAMP is elevated as a consequence of resolution once signals that drive inflammation are dampened and is not required for leukocyte clearance.</p><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Inflammatory environment dictates macrophage phenotype</bold>. rM cells from a 72-hour zymosan (0.1 mg)&#x02013;induced peritonitis were labeled with PKH26-PCL<sup>red</sup> and adoptively transferred at 72 hours to mice bearing a 10 mg zymosan (nonresolving inflammation) peritonitis and found not to trigger resolution as defined by little alterations in (A) total as well as individual cell numbers (PMNs, M&#x003a6;s, and innate-type lymphocytes, not shown) determined 24 hours later.

This was a particularly striking result given that PMN influx in macrophage-depleted animals was significantly higher than in controls at onset (4 hours, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A), suggesting that in the presence of limited phagocytosing macrophage numbers, PMNs may be efficiently cleared by stromal cells and/or via lymphatic drainage at resolution. In a recent report, we demonstrated the influx of innate-type lymphocytes during inflammatory resolution in rodents and humans.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref></sup> These repopulating lymphocytes had no role in actively switching off inflammation (clearing PMNs and/or macrophages) but restored tissue homeostasis and controlled against superinfection.

Taking this further, we found that rM COX 2 liberated an arachidonic acid&#x02013;derived prostanoid that signaled lymphocyte repopulation as administration of a selective COX 2 inhibitor during resolution impaired CD3 cell repopulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>E).

Given that neither rM nor M1 cells were found to proliferate as determined by BrdU incorporation (data not included), these data suggest that rM cells possess a greater propensity to remain in the peritoneum to elicit prohomeostatic functions via COX 2&#x02013;derived lipid mediators.</p><fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>rM mediates postresolution homeostasis</bold>.

Despite this, the phenotype of proresolution macrophages is not known. To redress this, we have shown that compared with macrophages taken from a peritonitis that progressed to systemic inflammation and that exhibited a classical M1 phenotype, macrophages harvested from the resolving phase of acute peritonitis possess a unique phenotype. These resolution-phase macrophages are generally M2 in nature as they express mannose receptor and synthesize IL-10 and arginase 1 but also express markers typical of M1 macrophages (ie, COX 2 and iNOS). The latter interestingly produces comparatively modest amounts of NO (1-5 &#x003bc;M) despite the extracellular levels of arginine (approximately 20-30 &#x003bc;M) in the inflammatory milieu. Indeed, these respective phenotypes were robust in situ and long lived, as rMs from day 6 or 9 postresolution cavities continued to elaborate IL-10 and responded ex vivo with quantitatively more IL-10 and COX 2 but not TNF&#x003b1; when treated with defined stimuli (TLR2, TLR4, TLR6, or NOD 2 receptor agonists; the latter is not shown). Therefore, we report these unique cells as a hybrid of both definitions, referring to them as proresolution or rM macrophage. Certainly, although macrophage heterogeneity is well recognized to be diverse,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref></sup> the M1/M2 classification has arisen largely from the results of in vitro experiments and it is more likely that macrophage phenotypes occupying sites of inflammation may be less defined. Indeed, deviations from this nomenclature were reported in other studies where, for instance, murine macrophages infected with <italic>Streptococcus pyogenes</italic> exhibit the classical M1 response but without iNOS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref></sup> Equally, F4/80<sup>+</sup>Gr1<sup>+</sup> macrophages with T cell&#x02013;suppressive activity and that are not M2 can be triggered in mice infected with schistosome egg glycans.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref></sup> Incidentally, rM cells in this current study that are F4/80 positive do not express the LY6C/G antigen (data not included). Therefore, it is this deviation from the in vitro&#x02013;derived definitions that underlines the complexity of classifying macrophages into too tight a category, thereby complying with the literature<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref></sup> that M2 cells have greater heterogeneity that M1 cells. In this regard, we suspect that in addition to the phenotype described here in the context of peritonitis, the phenotype of macrophages involved in the resolution of other immune responses needs to be evaluated and may be both tissue and stimulus specific.</p><p>The ability of macrophages to change phenotype during the course of inflammation is an emerging concept with an increasing body of literature suggesting that it might be a common theme in many tissues and disease states. For example, in experimental liver fibrosis, the same macrophages producing TNF&#x003b1; and TGF&#x003b2;1 during the inflammatory peak and that drove the disease pathogenesis were involved in tissue regeneration during the repair phase.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref></sup> Similarly, macrophages from the adipose tissue of lean mice, which are largely M2 and expressing F4/80<sup>+</sup>CD11c<sup>+</sup>, are changed upon diet-induced obesity to express the M1 genes, TNF&#x003b1; and iNOS.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref></sup> Given the impact M2 macrophages have on inflammatory disease outcome&#x02014;being central in ameliorating experimental allergic encephalitis<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref></sup> and experimental chronic inflammatory renal disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref></sup> and in conferring protection in the case of parasite-induced immune suppression of certain Th1-type diseases<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref></sup>&#x02014;understanding the flexible nature of macrophage phenotype would allow for greater pharmacological intervention to tailor inflammatory responses in an appropriate fashion. On this theme, we found that the potent immunomodulator, cAMP,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref></sup> is elevated in rMs, being comparatively lower in M1 cells. Moreover, increasing cAMP in M1 macrophages reduced TNF&#x003b1; secretion as well as their ability to kill <italic>S aureus</italic> while elevating COX 2 and iNOS, properties identical to rM cells. Conversely, inhibiting cAMP in rM cells changed their phenotype to that akin to M1 cells (ie, elaborating proinflammatory cytokines and increasing their bactericidal properties). Indeed, a well-documented consequence of catecholamines, used to treat hypotension associated with septic shock, includes stimulation of bacterial growth.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref></sup> As catecholamines elevate cAMP in cells of the innate immune system,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref></sup> it is tempting to speculate that increases in bacterial growth by catecholamines in the clinical literature may result, at least in part, from the formation of a bactericidal-naive rM phenotype. Thus, cAMP is at the center of controlling the phenotype of inflammatory macrophages in a manner that differentially regulates bacteria killing and cytokine release.</p><p>However, manipulating cAMP and therefore macrophage phenotype in vivo to resolve ongoing inflammation, as defined by PMN clearance concomitant with lymphocyte repopulation,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref></sup> is more ambiguous. For instance, transferring rM cells to mice bearing 10 mg zymosan failed to trigger resolution in these animals. It transpired that the phenotype of adoptively transferred rMs was altered by the inflammatory environment of ongoing inflammation to that resembling M1 cells, explaining the lack of efficacy of rM cells in these experiments. In contrast, the phenotype of M1 cells in inflammation elicited by 10 mg zymosan was partially altered toward rMs by cAMP-elevating agents, resulting in reduced TNF&#x003b1;, reflecting results obtained from in vitro reprogramming experiments. However, unlike the well-established anti-inflammatory effects of rolipram and A2<sub>A</sub> receptor agonists when given prophylactically at onset<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref></sup> (D.W.G., unpublished data, March 2008), elevating cAMP during established inflammation did not reduce peritoneal leukocyte numbers. Thus, although pharmacological manipulation of cAMP brings about a change in macrophage phenotype during established inflammation with implications for the resolution of systemic inflammation, this is insufficient to trigger leukocyte clearance. These results suggest that soluble factors that drive ongoing inflammation predominate over proresolution factors. For this reason, we sought an alternative strategy to discern the role of rMs in self-limiting acute inflammation.</p><p>To this end, macrophages were depleted using clodronate-filled liposomes, revealing that despite a significant increase in PMNs at onset over controls, PMNs were significantly lower in clodronate-treated animals compared with rM-sufficient mice. This implies that in the presence of limiting rM numbers, PMNs can be efficiently cleared leading to resolution, with lymphatic drainage or phagocytosis by stromal cells representing likely alternative clearance routes for PMNs under these conditions. However, a consequence of limiting rM numbers was failed repopulation of resolution-phase lymphocytes, which we have shown recently to be a marker of postinflammation restoration of tissue physiology and essential for controlling innate immune&#x02013;mediated responses to secondary infection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref></sup> Therefore, we propose that cAMP is elevated consequent to resolution once signals that drive inflammation are dampened. And although it controls the balance of proinflammatory versus anti-inflammatory cytokines, cAMP is not required for leukocyte clearance. Once resolution processes are under way, COX 2&#x02013;expressing rM cells, as a result of elevated cAMP, restore postinflammation homeostasis to equip injured tissue with the necessary cellular armamentarium (innate-type lymphocytes) to mount subsequent and appropriately tempered inflammatory events.</p><p>In conclusion, we have identified the phenotype of rMs as generally M2 but with characteristics of proinflammatory, M1 cells. rMs appear dispensable for PMN clearance during resolution but are essential for restoring tissue homeostasis to combat future infections.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplemental Figures]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="blood-2007-12-129767_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="blood-2007-12-129767_1.pdf"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="blood-2007-12-129767_2.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supplementary-material"><p>The online version of this article contains a data supplement.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p>The publication costs of this article were defrayed in part by page charge payment.
