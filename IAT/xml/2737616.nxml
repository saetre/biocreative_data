The molecular composition of these structures including the T-bar and ribbon are largely unknown, as are the mechanisms that specify their synapse-specific assembly and distribution. In a large-scale, forward genetic screen, we have identified a mutation termed <italic>air traffic controller</italic> (<italic>atc</italic>) that causes T-bar&#x02013;like protein aggregates to form abnormally in motoneuron axons. This mutation disrupts a gene that encodes for a serine-arginine protein kinase (SRPK79D). This mutant phenotype is specific to SRPK79D and is not secondary to impaired kinesin-dependent axonal transport. The <italic>srpk79D</italic> gene is neuronally expressed, and transgenic rescue experiments are consistent with SRPK79D kinase activity being necessary in neurons. The SRPK79D protein colocalizes with the T-bar-associated protein Bruchpilot (Brp) in both the axon and synapse. We propose that SRPK79D is a novel T-bar-associated protein kinase that represses T-bar assembly in peripheral axons, and that SRPK79D-dependent repression must be relieved to facilitate site-specific AZ assembly. Consistent with this model, overexpression of SRPK79D disrupts AZ-specific Brp organization and significantly impairs presynaptic neurotransmitter release. These data identify a novel AZ-associated protein kinase and reveal a new mechanism of negative regulation involved in AZ assembly. This mechanism could contribute to the speed and specificity with which AZs are assembled throughout the nervous system.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Neurons communicate with each other through electrochemical impulses transmitted primarily at specialized intercellular junctions termed synapses. At each synapse, the primary site of synaptic vesicle fusion occurs at the active zone, an electron-dense presynaptic membrane with associated fibrillary matrix. Many active zones also possess one or more electron-dense cytosolic projections that are believed to facilitate vesicle mobilization to the active zone membrane and are required for normal synaptic transmission. These electron-dense projections are referred to as T-bars in <italic>Drosophila</italic> or ribbons in vertebrates. The molecular composition of these structures remains poorly characterized, and very little is known about how these structures are specifically assembled and stabilized at the presynaptic membrane. Here, we identify in <italic>Drosophila</italic> a neuronally expressed serine-arginine kinase called SRPK79D that localizes to the presynaptic active zone and that through its kinase activity appears to repress T-bar formation within peripheral axons. Our study thus provides evidence for kinase-dependent repression of active zone assembly, with implications for the development and growth of synaptic connections throughout the nervous system.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="17"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The majority of stimulus-dependent synaptic vesicle fusion occurs at presynaptic specializations called active zones (AZs). Ultrastructurally, AZs consist of at least two components; 1) a presynaptic membrane of high electron density, reflecting the presence of proteins such as Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> channels, t-SNAREs, and cell adhesion molecules and 2) a fibrillary cytomatrix (CAZ) that includes cytoskeletal elements, scaffolding proteins, and AZ-specific molecules such as Piccolo/Aczonin, Bassoon, Unc-13/Dunc-13/Munc-13, RIM, and ELKS/Brp/ERC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000193-Zhai1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Many synapses that are characterized by a high release probability also include an electron-dense cytosolic projection that is believed to facilitate synaptic vesicle movement to the AZ. These projections are referred to as ribbons in the mammalian retina, dense bodies at the mammalian neuromuscular junction (NMJ), and T-bars at the <italic>Drosophila</italic> NMJ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000193-Zhai1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000193-tomDieck1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. To date, five proteins have been found within the presynaptic ribbon at synapses in the vertebrate retina, including Piccolo, Kif3A, RIM, CtBP1, and RIBEYE/CtBP2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000193-Zhai1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000193-tomDieck1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, there are no clear homologs of RIBEYE or Piccolo, and it remains unknown whether RIM or Kif3A associate with the <italic>Drosophila</italic> T-bar. The protein currently known to localize at the T-bar is the <italic>Drosophila</italic> homolog of ELKS/ERC, called Bruchpilot (Brp) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000193-Wagh1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000193-Kittel1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Recently, it was demonstrated that mutations in the <italic>brp</italic> gene eliminate T-bars and severely impair synaptic vesicle release, consistent with the conclusion that T-bars and Brp are essential components of the presynaptic AZ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000193-Wagh1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000193-Kittel1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>T-bars and ribbons are large, macromolecular structures. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, T-bars are first assembled at late embryonic stages as the nascent neuromuscular synapse begins to mature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000193-Broadie1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000193-PackChung1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. The appearance of T-bars and T-bar-associated antigens correlates with the ability of the neuromuscular junction to support larval movement. T-bars are formed only at the presynaptic face of the AZ and are not found at other sites, implying the existence of mechanisms that ensure site-specific assembly of these large, cytoplasmic structures. However, virtually nothing is known about how T-bar and ribbon structures are assembled and positioned at the AZ.</p><p>One model for AZ formation that could be extended to ribbon/T-bar assembly is based upon the existence of transport vesicles that contain AZ components, including calcium channels as well as the Piccolo and Bassoon proteins. It has been suggested that these transport vesicles fuse at sites of nascent synapse formation to deliver protein constituents of the AZ in a site-specific manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000193-Ahmari1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000193-Shapira1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Although transport vesicles have not been isolated in <italic>Drosophila</italic> motoneurons, it was recently demonstrated that mutation of a Kinesin 3 (<italic>immaculate connections</italic>; <italic>imac</italic>) prevents the transport of synaptic vesicle proteins to the developing synapse, and in this mutant background, both AZ and T-bar formation are significantly impaired <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000193-PackChung1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. These data suggest that a critical component of AZ and T-bar assembly is contributed by Imac-dependent axonal transport. Although transport vesicles could represent a mechanism to deliver transmembrane and membrane-associated proteins to the AZ, there presumably exist other mechanisms to control the site-specific assembly of cytoplasmic proteins into a T-bar.</p><p>Here, we describe a previously uncharacterized gene in <italic>Drosophila</italic> that encodes a serine-threonine kinase that we have termed <italic>serine-arginine protein kinase at 79D</italic> (<italic>srpk79D</italic>). The SRPK79D protein is a member of the serine-arginine protein kinase family previously shown to be involved in mRNA splicing and processing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000193-Graveley1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. This gene was identified in a large-scale forward genetic screen for genes involved in the development, maturation, and stabilization of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> NMJ. In this study, we present evidence that SRPK79D is a T-bar-associated protein kinase that is necessary to prevent premature T-bar assembly in peripheral axons. We also present evidence that SRPK79D activity must be overcome within the NMJ for normal AZ assembly and neurotransmission. As such, our data identify a new T-bar-associated antigen and indicate that synapse-specific assembly of the presynaptic T-bar may be achieved, in part, through suppression of T-bar assembly at nonsynaptic sites including the axon.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title><italic>srpk79D</italic> Loss of Function Causes Bruchpilot Accumulation in Larval Nerves</title><p>In an ongoing screen to identify genes involved in the formation and stabilization of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> NMJ, we identified a P-element insertion (P10036) in which the peripheral nerves contain numerous large accumulations of the AZ associated protein Brp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000193-g001">Figure 1E&#x02013;1G</xref>).

In each mutant background, we have stained three to five larvae with anti-Brp and anti-Discs Large (Dlg) antibodies and examined both the peripheral nerves and the neuromuscular synapse for defects. P10036 is the only mutation identified to date that causes the observed accumulation of anti-Brp staining in peripheral axons. The P10036 transposon resides within an intron of the previously uncharacterized gene <italic>CG11489</italic>, which resides at chromosomal position 79D and is predicted to encode a member of the SRPK family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000193-g001">Figure 1A</xref> and see below).

From these data, we conclude that Brp-positive puncta in <italic>srpk79D<sup>atc</sup></italic> mutant axons represent larger, abnormal, protein aggregates compared to observations made in wild-type axons.</p><p>Next, we assayed synaptic Brp staining intensity and NMJ morphology in the <italic>srpk79D<sup>atc</sup></italic> mutant.

To examine this question further, we analyzed the size and intensity of anti-Brp puncta in wild-type axons and synapses. At the light level, the vast majority of Brp puncta in wild-type axons are smaller and less intense than the puncta observed within the wild-type presynaptic nerve terminal, suggesting that synaptic T-bars are assembled at the synapse from constituent proteins, including Brp, that are transported down the axon to the synapse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000193-g005">Figure 5</xref>). By contrast, Brp puncta observed in <italic>srpk79D</italic> mutants stained more intensely and were much larger than Brp puncta found in wild-type axons. These Brp puncta were also often larger than the T-bar-associated Brp puncta observed at wild-type NMJ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000193-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Thus, the large Brp accumulations found in <italic>srpk79D</italic> mutant axons could represent superassemblies of T-bar-related proteins, including Brp.

We have never observed a similar structure in wild-type axons. In this study, we performed electron microscopy on five wild-type animals, analyzing 150 sections from the segmental nerves. None of these sections showed evidence of electron-dense aggregates. We performed electron microscopy on nine <italic>srpk79D</italic> mutant animals, analyzing 325 sections from segmental nerves. Sections from every mutant animal showed evidence of electron-dense plaques. Nearly every section from an individual mutant showed evidence of electron-dense plaques, consistent with the highly penetrant phenotype observed at the light level. The dimensions of these electron-dense structures, the prevalence of these structures in our electron microscopy sections and the similarity of their shape to T-bars present at the AZ strongly suggest that these structures represent the large Brp aggregates (superassemblies) that we observe at the light level in the <italic>srpk79D</italic> mutant background. Finally, similar to T-bars found at AZs, these electron-dense structures were surrounded by a filamentous matrix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000193-g006">Figure 6A&#x02013;6D</xref>). Although vesicles were also observed in these areas, we believe that they are molecularly distinct from synaptic vesicles because synaptic vesicle markers do not colocalize with Brp in the <italic>srpk79D</italic> mutant axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000193-g004">Figure 4A&#x02013;4L</xref>).

We found that neuronally expressed Venus-SRPK79D-RD&#x0002a;, which rescues axonal Brp accumulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000193-g003">Figure 3G&#x02013;3J</xref>), precisely colocalizes with Brp in both the nerve and at each presynaptic AZ (see below). The voltage-gated calcium channel Cacophony is among very few other proteins that have been demonstrated to colocalize with Brp at the presynaptic AZ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000193-Guo1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, Venus-SRPK79D-RD&#x0002a; is highly unusual in that this protein has been shown to colocalize with Brp in a wild-type axon. These data suggest that SRPK79D closely associates with Brp during axonal transport of the Brp protein to the presynaptic nerve terminal. It is possible that the distribution of the tagged-SRPK79D protein does not reflect the wild-type SRPK79D protein distribution. However, the observation that Venus-SRPK79D-RD&#x0002a; shows a very restricted distribution, colocalizing with Brp in at least two cellular compartments, argues that this protein reflects, at least in part, the normal protein distribution.</p><p>Given that SRPK79D colocalizes with Brp, we considered two hypotheses for SRPK79D function. First, we considered the hypothesis that SRPK79D somehow influences total Brp protein levels in the cell, perhaps by influencing Brp stability or turnover. However, when we assayed total Brp protein levels by western blot, we found no change in the <italic>srpk79D</italic> mutant compared to wild type and no evidence of altered protein degradation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000193.s004">Figure S4B and S4C</xref>). Although western blots fail to measure Brp protein levels exclusively in motoneurons, this is consistent with our prior observation that axon Brp fluorescence increases while synaptic Brp decreases in the <italic>srpk79D</italic> mutant, leaving total Brp protein levels constant in the cell. To further examine this possibility, we overexpressed a GFP-tagged <italic>brp</italic> transgene in otherwise wild-type motoneurons using the GAL4-UAS expression system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000193-Wagh1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Although this resulted in the accumulation of Brp protein within axons, GFP-Brp overexpression did not precisely phenocopy the <italic>srpk79D</italic> mutant. GFP-Brp expression simultaneously increased synaptic and axonal fluorescence, whereas the <italic>srpk79D</italic> mutation causes increased axonal Brp and a correlated decrease in synaptic Brp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000193-g001">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000193-g002">2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000193-g007">7A&#x02013;7I</xref>). Thus, although Brp overexpression is sufficient to cause axonal aggregates, it seems unlikely that this is the cause of the defect in the <italic>srpk79D</italic> mutant. Consistent with this conclusion, co-overexpression of BRP and SRPK79D-RD&#x0002a; does not reduce the severity of the axonal accumulations caused by BRP overexpression alone. Similarly, axonal accumulations caused by BRP overexpression are not dramatically enhanced by mutating one copy of the <italic>srpk79D</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000193-g007">Figure 7J</xref>). To further address this issue, we asked whether Brp aggregates form in homozygous <italic>srpk79D<sup>atc</sup></italic> mutants in which we decrease total Brp levels by removing one copy of the <italic>brp</italic> gene (<italic>brp<sup>69</sup></italic>/&#x0002b;;<italic>srpk79D<sup>atc</sup></italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000193-Kittel1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>.

We therefore favor an alternative model based upon the observation that SRPK79D colocalizes with Brp and speculate that SRPK79D could sequester or inhibit the function of axonal T-bar proteins and thereby prevent the formation of axonal T-bar&#x02013;like superassemblies.</p><fig id="pbio-1000193-g007" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pbio.1000193.g007</object-id><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>Brp accumulation in <italic>srpk79D</italic> mutants is not due to increased Brp expression.</title><p>(A and B) Immunofluorescence images of wild-/type and <italic>srpk79D</italic> mutant nerves.

This model also suggests that SRPK79D activity must be inhibited locally, at the AZ, in order for synaptic T-bar assembly to proceed. We reasoned that overexpressing SRPK79D might overwhelm the synaptic machinery that disrupts SRPK79D activity and thereby reveal a role for SRPK79D during T-bar assembly or synaptic function. Here, we show that SRPK79D overexpression disrupts the punctate, highly organized appearance of synaptic Brp immunoreactivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000193-g009">Figures 9A&#x02013;9D</xref> and S5A&#x02013;S5D). For example, we observed regions where Brp was diffusely organized near the synaptic membrane. These regions encompass areas that would normally contain several individual Brp puncta. We hypothesize that these regions of diffuse Brp reflect either failed T-bar assembly or severely perturbed AZ organization. In addition, we found that SRPK79D overexpression also led to a decrease in total synaptic Brp fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000193-g009">Figure 9E</xref>).

This is consistent with a negative regulatory role for SRPK79D during T-bar assembly and indicates that once SRPK79D-dependent repression of T-bar assembly is relieved, AZ assembly proceeds normally. Overexpression of SRPK79D, however, severely disrupts neurotransmission. The defect in presynaptic release is correlated with a disruption of Brp puncta organization and integrity. These phenotypes are consistent with a function for SRPK79D as a negative regulator of T-bar assembly and AZ maturation.</p><p>SRPK79D is a member of the SRPK family of constitutively active cytoplasmic serine-threonine kinases that target serine-arginine&#x02013;rich domains of SR proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000193-Colwill1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000193-Huang1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>.

One interesting possibility is that RNA species are resident at the T-bar. In such a scenario, SRPK79D-dependent repression of RNA translation could prevent T-bar assembly in the axon, and relief of this repression would enable T-bar assembly at the AZ. The continued association of SRPK79D with the AZ could allow regulated control of further T-bar assembly during development, aging, and possibly as a mechanism of long-term synaptic plasticity. Several results provide evidence in support of such a possibility. First, local translation has been proposed to control local protein concentration within a navigating growth cone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000193-Leung1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000193-Sutton1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>.

A specific role for RNA binding proteins at the presynaptic AZ is supported by the prior identification of the RIBEYE protein, which is a constituent of the vertebrate ribbon structure. RIBEYE contains a CtBP domain previously shown to bind RNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000193-Schmitz1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. The discovery of a different RNA binding protein (CtBP1) at the ribbon and our description of a putative RNA regulatory protein at the <italic>Drosophila</italic> T-bar further suggest that RNA processing might be involved in the formation or function of these presynaptic electron dense structures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000193-tomDieck1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In light of these data, we explored the possibility that SRPK79D might participate in translational control related to T-bar assembly.

We also generated genomic deletions for <italic>bru2</italic> and <italic>bru3</italic>. However, we did not find evidence of axonal Brp aggregation in any of these mutants. Next, we assayed mutations previously shown to be required for mRNA transport and local protein synthesis. If necessary for T-bar assembly, these mutations might disrupt synaptic Brp-dependent T-bar formation. These mutations, including <italic>orb</italic>, <italic>vas</italic>, and <italic>stau</italic>, have phenotypes at earlier stages of development, but show no defect in synaptic Brp staining <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000193-Webster1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000193-Christerson1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000193-Syken1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, although these experiments do not rule out a function for SRPK79D in local translation, we have examined mutations in several additional candidates and failed to uncover evidence in support of this model.</p><p>Another possibility is that SRPK79D inhibits T-bar assembly through the constitutive phosphorylation-dependent control of a putative SR protein that colocalizes with SRPK79D and Brp within a nascent T-bar protein complex. Upon arrival of this nascent T-bar protein complex at the presynaptic nerve terminal, T-bar assembly could be initiated in a site-specific manner through the action of a phosphatase that is concentrated at a newly forming synapse. There are several examples of phosphatases that can be localized to sites of intercellular adhesion, some of which have been implicated in the mechanisms of synapse formation and remodeling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000193-Dick1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>. This model, therefore, proposes that negative regulation of T-bar assembly, via SRPK79D, is a critical process required for the rapid and site-specific assembly of the presynaptic AZ-associated T-bar structure. Finally, we can not rule out the possibility that SRPK79D normally functions to prevent T-bar superassembly as opposed to T-bar assembly per se. Consistent with this idea is the observation of T-bar aggregates in axons and prior observation that detached ribbon structures coalesce into large assemblies in vertebrate neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000193-Buchanan1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Controlling the Process of Synapse Assembly through Negative Regulation</title><p>Synapse assembly is a remarkably rapid event.

The majority of small GFP-Brp puncta were found to be motile with individual puncta exhibiting anterograde and/or retrograde transport during a given imaging epoch. The average rate of small GFP-Brp puncta transport was 0.08&#x000b1;0.009 &#x000b5;m/s (average&#x000b1;SEM). Although this rate is somewhat slower than values previously reported for the transport of GFP-tagged Syt, it falls within the range of reported values <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000193-Pilling1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. In contrast, large GFP-Brp accumulations were generally immotile (as shown here). Occasionally, a large accumulation was observed to alternately exhibit anterograde and then retrograde transport. However, total displacement was never more than 0.3 &#x000b5;m (unpublished data).</p><p>(0.43 MB TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pbio.1000193.s003.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pbio.1000193.s004"><label>Figure S4</label><caption><p><bold>Supplemental molecular analyses.</bold> (A) Northern blot analysis of Brp transcripts in mRNA purified from wild-type (left lane) or homozygous <italic>srpk79D<sup>atc</sup></italic> mutant (right lane) adult fly heads indicates no difference in mRNA processing between the two genotypes.
