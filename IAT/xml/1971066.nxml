There are three key processes that occur during early meiosis which are responsible for the juxtaposition of homologous chromosomes required for successful production of haploid gametes, namely chromosome pairing, recombination and chromosome synapsis. Studies investigating the molecular nature of homologous chromosome pairing have revealed a complex relationship between these three processes.</p><p>Complexity is particularly pronounced in polyploid organisms such as the allohexaploid bread wheat (<italic>Triticum aestivum</italic>). Bread wheat contains seven groups of chromosomes which are derived from three diploid progenitor species (AABBDD; 2n = 6&#x000d7; = 42). Despite the genome complexity of this important crop, each chromosome will pair only with its homologue, despite the potential for pairing with an equivalent chromosome from one of the other two related or homoeologous genomes. Extensive cytological analysis of chromosome dynamics during early meiosis in normal bread wheat and mutants such as <italic>Ph1 </italic>and <italic>Ph2 </italic>(<underline>p</underline>airing <underline>h</underline>omoeologous), which display reduced specificity of chromosome pairing to homologues, have provided valuable information on the control of chromosome pairing in this organism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. However, to date there are no individual proteins that have been identified and characterised from bread wheat that have been shown to have a role in homologous chromosome pairing and synapsis.</p><p>Pairing of homologous chromosomes is closely followed by synapsis through the formation of a proteinaceous structure referred to as the synaptonemal complex (SC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The evolutionary conservation of the SC within sexually reproducing organisms and its demonstrated association with recombination indicates a fundamental and critical role during meiosis I (for comprehensive reviews on the biology of the SC refer to [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]). The SC is composed of three components: the axial/lateral elements, transverse filaments and a dense central element. While several genes encoding SC and SC-associated proteins including ZIP1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and SCP1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] have been isolated and characterised in both yeast and mammals since the discovery of this structure 50 years ago, it has only been recently that the first SC plant specific protein was reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], even though this structure has been comprehensively dissected cytologically. The slow progress in plants is mainly due to limited sequence conservation of SC proteins from various eukaryotic species, as reflected in a study of ZYP1 from <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, which shares only 18 and 20% sequence identity to ZIP1 and SCP1 from yeast and mouse respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. This problem is being overcome through two approaches. Reverse genetics is being used in Arabidopsis and rice to identify genes involved in chromosome synapsis by analysing mutants that display an abnormal synaptic phenotype during early meiosis, and additionally, an <italic>in silico </italic>screening of databases is used to identify proteins that contain secondary structures that are conserved amongst known SC proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>One class of meiotic mutants used to identify genes that code for components of the SC in plants are termed asynaptic. These mutants are typically characterised as being defective in homologous chromosome synapsis, from which other defects follow, including dramatically increased frequency of univalents at pachytene and reduced fertility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Several such genes have been reported in the literature including <italic>HOP1 </italic>from yeast (<italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], <italic>ASY1 </italic>from Arabidopsis and <italic>Brassica oleracea </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and <italic>PAIR2 </italic>from rice (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. In addition, the location and activity of ASY1 orthologues during meiosis in maize and rye has been investigated using the <italic>At</italic>ASY1 antibody in studies of mutants displaying abnormal chromosomal morphology during prophase I, which also supports results obtained from Arabidopsis and rice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. A common feature of the three characterised asynaptic genes is the presence of a HORMA domain (<underline>Ho</underline>p1, <underline>R</underline>ev7, <underline>MA</underline>D2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] which appears to facilitate direct interaction of proteins containing this domain with chromatin during mitosis and meiosis, including chromatin associated with DNA adducts and DNA double stranded breaks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p><p>In an attempt to further understand the mechanism of pairing/synapsis of homologous chromosomes during meiosis in bread wheat, we have characterised the expression and protein localisation of the wheat orthologue of <italic>ASY1 </italic>of Arabidopsis, <italic>TaASY1</italic>. This gene shares significant sequence identity and similar features (including the presence of a HORMA domain) to previously characterised asynaptic genes including the Arabidopsis, <italic>Brassica </italic>and rice orthologues and is likely to play a pivotal role during meiosis in bread wheat.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title><italic>TaASY1 </italic>is a wheat orthologue of <italic>AtASY1</italic>, <italic>BoASY1 </italic>and rice <italic>PAIR2 </italic>and is located on wheat chromosome group 5</title><p>Analysis of the complete open reading frame (ORF) of <italic>TaASY1 </italic>showed significant sequence similarity to the previously characterised asynapsis genes <italic>PAIR2 </italic>from rice, <italic>ASY1 </italic>from Arabidopsis and <italic>Brassica</italic>, and to a lesser extent, <italic>HOP1 </italic>from yeast.

Genome specificity of the primers was confirmed with amplification of a 446 bp fragment using template from the three nullisomic-tetrasomic lines of chromosome Group 5 and wild-type Chinese Spring (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). Bread wheat deletion lines that contained varying distal deletions of 5A long arm (5AL) were then screened using these primers (courtesy of Professor Takashi Endo, National Bioresource Project, Kyoto University, Japan). The fragment specific for the A genome was amplified in a deletion line that contained 0.35 fraction length (FL &#x02013; see Methods; DNA isolation, Southern blot and PCR analysis) of the 5AL (5AL 19-5, Professor Takashi Endo, <italic>personal communication</italic>), but not in a line that contained 0.32 FL of 5AL (5AL 12-1, NBRP, Kyoto University, Japan) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>).

Coupled with the cytological studies have been the extensive mapping strategies of Griffiths and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] to identify the gene(s) responsible for the <italic>Ph1 </italic>phenotype, culminating in the identification of four <italic>cdc2</italic>-related genes and a sub-telomeric heterochromatic region that translocated from chromosome 3AL, as candidates for the <italic>Ph1 </italic>effect. Theses approaches have been built around the use of the genetic information to track down genes that control pairing. There have been few reports of studies aimed at deciphering components of the wheat meiotic machinery based on candidates identified in other systems. The characterisation of <italic>TaASY1 </italic>described here suggests that knowledge from other systems can be applied to bread wheat and can help build a molecular view of pairing and recombination.</p><p>While the presence of <italic>TaASY1 </italic>on chromosome Group 5 implies that it does not represent <italic>Ph2</italic>, its location and putative role, based on the asynaptic phenotype of Arabidopsis and rice mutants, suggests it may still be involved with either the product of the <italic>Ph1 </italic>and/or <italic>Ph2 </italic>loci; albeit indirectly. Based on the findings of Griffiths et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], and Southern analysis that we have conducted using the <italic>Ph1 </italic>mutant, <italic>ph1b </italic>(data not shown), <italic>TaASY1 </italic>does not represent <italic>Ph1</italic>. Given its location on the long arm of chromosome 5A, it is possible that <italic>TaASY1 </italic>represents one of the previously reported minor chromosome pairing promoters on 5AL and/or 5DL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. However, further experimentation will be required to determine if any of these loci represent <italic>TaASY1</italic>. This work is likely to involve precise location of the gene relative to various bread wheat deletion lines that have previously been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>].</p><p><italic>TaASY1</italic>, <italic>ASY1 </italic>from Arabidopsis and <italic>Brassica</italic>, and <italic>PAIR2 </italic>from rice represent the only HORMA domain containing proteins identified in plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. The amino acid sequences of the ASY1 and PAIR2 proteins display significant sequence similarity to <italic>Ta</italic>ASY1. When comparing only the HORMA domain of all known asynaptic proteins reported, sequence identity increased significantly suggesting that the HORMA domain is essential for the function of <italic>Ta</italic>ASY1 and its orthologues. However, this is not always the case when comparing sequences of meiotic proteins across various organisms, with sequence identities varying widely for proteins involved in the evolutionarily conserved process of chromosome pairing and synapsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. This is highlighted by the difficulty to predict meiotic activity of <italic>Os</italic>PAIR2 based around the extensive knowledge of <italic>Sc</italic>HOP1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>].</p><p>The <italic>TaASY1 </italic>gene structure is very similar to the reported structures of <italic>AtASY1 </italic>and <italic>OsPAIR2</italic>, with all three genes having 22 exons and 21 introns. The similarity in gene structure of <italic>TaASY1 </italic>and <italic>OsPAIR2 </italic>is also reflected in the location of the two genes, with chromosome Group 5 of bread wheat displaying high levels of gene order conservation with rice Chromosome 9, on which <italic>OsPAIR2 </italic>resides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>The three transcript analysis procedures used in this study clearly indicated significant expression of <italic>TaASY1 </italic>in meiotic tissue, with highest expression predominantly confined to pre-meiosis and leptotene to pachytene. The leptotene to pachytene result was expected based on these stages being when synapsis occurs, which is also reflected by the phenotypes of <italic>asy1 </italic>and <italic>pair2 </italic>mutants where chromosomes fail to synapse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>The Q-PCR data indicated that transcript levels of <italic>TaASY1 </italic>remained elevated from diplotene through to the completion of telophase II. This may be due to minor asynchrony between the collection of anthers that were selected for staging and subsequent RNA isolation. In addition, as wheat meiosis takes only 24 hours to complete it is possible that the elevated expression seen later in meiosis represents the mRNA that remained in the cells as they rapidly progressed through the meiotic cycle, after the relatively lengthy prophase I period of 17 hours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. Although the <italic>TaASY1 </italic>transcript was not detected in vegetative tissues using northern analysis, Q-PCR and microarray analysis suggested that there were very low levels of expression (up to approximately 40,000 fold less). Both these technology platforms are extremely sensitive to very low transcript levels.</p><p>The elevated transcript expression in meiotic tissue correlates with the detection of protein seen in the western analysis. The very low level of protein in the leaf and root tissues contrasts to results from Arabidopsis and rice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. However, the differences detected between the reports could be attributed to alternative experimental procedures used, including the protein extraction procedure and the higher concentration of primary antibody used in this study.</p><p>While it was not possible to define whether <italic>Ta</italic>ASY1 associated directly with axial elements, immunolocalisation using TEM revealed that <italic>Ta</italic>ASY1 associates with chromatin regions of axial elements prior to formation of the SC, as well as chromatin of lateral elements within a formed SC. These results are consistent with the previous data in Arabidopsis and rice where ASY1/PAIR2 are shown to have a role in pairing and synapsis of homologous chromosomes. Although <italic>Ta</italic>ASY1 is located adjacent to axial elements prior to SC formation, it is unlikely to have a role in initiation of axial element formation since dense axial elements still formed in the rice <italic>pair2 </italic>mutants. In addition, as the axial elements that formed in the <italic>pair2 </italic>mutant were comparable in size to those in the wild-type plant, especially when compared to the differences in axial element size and distribution of ASY1 in the maize mutant <italic>afd1</italic>, it is unlikely that the labelling of <italic>Ta</italic>ASY1 to axial elements in wheat is due to a role in axial element elongation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><p>Localisation of <italic>Ta</italic>ASY1 to components of the SC both before and after SC formation indicates a role for this protein in synapsis and/or pairing of homologous chromosomes. A role for <italic>Ta</italic>ASY1 in synapsis is supported by results of Mikhailova et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Using a rye mutant that failed to correctly synapse homologous chromosomes, Mikhailova et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] demonstrated that ASY1 and ZYP1 (a known SC component) still load correctly onto chromosome axes without formation of the tripartite SC. It is plausible therefore that the localisation of <italic>Ta</italic>ASY1 to axial elements prior to synapsis may represent a role in recruiting components of the SC, such as ZYP1, to the axial elements in preparation for SC formation.</p><p>While support for a role in chromosome pairing is less obvious, it has been shown that the Arabidopsis <italic>asy1 </italic>mutant exhibits near normal centromere and telomere pairing behaviour during interphase and leptotene but subsequent stages are atypical, with non-recognisable pairing and synapsis of homologues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. This indicates that ASY1 is active between the time point where telomeres and centromeres first associate and homologues correctly synapse. Therefore, in bread wheat <italic>TaASY1 </italic>represents an interesting candidate for further research into how homologues are resolved from their homoeologues, since the seven homoeologous centromere clusters form prior to the resolution of 21 homologous chromosome pairs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>A long term objective of this research is to pursue an efficient methodology for the induction of pairing control and recombination in bread wheat. Significant progress was recently made towards this goal with the molecular characterisation of the <italic>Ph1 </italic>locus by Griffiths et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. However, to understand the mechanism of action of <italic>cdc2</italic>-kinases found at the <italic>Ph1 </italic>locus, it may be necessary to characterise down stream proteins involved in chromosome synapsis, such as <italic>Ta</italic>ASY1. To this end we have begun investigating what proteins interact with <italic>Ta</italic>ASY1 and where these proteins are located within the bread wheat genome.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have isolated and characterised the wheat homologue of <italic>ScHOP1</italic>, <italic>AtASY1 </italic>and <italic>OsPAIR2</italic>; called <italic>TaASY1</italic>. This study has enhanced our understanding of proteins that are responsible for the correct pairing and synapsis of homologous chromosomes in bread wheat. <italic>TaASY1 </italic>is located on Chromosome group 5, with a copy on each of the three genomes; A, B and D. Transcript and protein expression analyses indicate a role for this protein during the early stages of meiosis, specifically during prophase I. This was confirmed by immunolocalisation using TEM, which showed that <italic>Ta</italic>ASY1 interacts with chromatin of SC associated structures during zygotene and pachytene, before being removed or degraded during later stages.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Plant materials</title><p>Hexaploid wheat plants including wild-type (<italic>Triticum aestivum </italic>cv.
