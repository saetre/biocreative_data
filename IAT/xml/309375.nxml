The SSRP family includes the mouse protein T160, which recognizes recombination signal sequences. In order to delineate functional domains more clearly, a homolog of SSRP1 was cloned from Drosophila melanogaster. This homolog maps to polytene region 60A (1-4) and shares 54% identity with human SSRP1. Comparison of the predicted amino acid sequences among SSRP family members reveals 48% identity, with structural conservation in the carboxy terminus of the HMG box as well as domains of highly charged residues. Interestingly, however, the most highly conserved regions of the protein are in the less well understood amino terminus, strongly suggesting that this portion of the protein is critical for its function.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00056-0141-a" xlink:role="1644"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00056-0140.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1643"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00056-0141.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1644"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00056-0142.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1645"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00056-0143.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1646"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
