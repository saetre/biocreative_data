PcG proteins function by forming three multi-protein complexes, PRC1, PRC2, and PhoRC. Genetic and biochemical studies have led to the current model in which the complexes work together to establish and maintain methylation marks, primarily on the tail of histone H3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004750-Schwartz1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004750-Mller1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. The PhoRC complex contains sequence-specific DNA binding activity and also interacts with mono- and di-methylated lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004750-Brown1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004750-Klymenko1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. It has been proposed that PhoRC plays the critical role of recognizing hypomethylated nucleosomes around upstream regulatory elements of PcG target genes. The PRC2 complex contains histone methyl-transferase (HMTase) activity that trimethylates H3K27 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004750-Czermin1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004750-Mller2">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. H3K27me3 is a well-known mark for silenced chromatin and is associated with promoters and regulatory elements of PcG target genes. The PRC1 complex binds H3K27me3 and prevents chromatin remodeling, thereby maintaining target chromatin regions in the silenced state <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004750-Cao1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004750-Fischle1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>trxG proteins also function in multi-subunit complexes. Three trxG complexes, the SET1-like complex, the BRM complex and the MLL supercomplex, have been purified in mammalian cells. The SET1-like complex contains HMTase activities and trimethylates lysine 4 of histone H3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004750-Yokoyama1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>.

The MLL supercomplex contains both HMTase activities and chromatin remodeling activities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004750-Nakamura1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>PcG and trxG mutations have opposite effects on axial patterning. PcG mutations cause posterior transformations and trxG mutations cause anterior transformations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004750-Kennison1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, genetic experiments in Drosophila show that most PcG and trxG mutations are reciprocally suppressive. These observations are consistent with the opposing functions of PcG and trxG proteins to establish silenced and active chromatin structures, respectively. Surprisingly, mutations in a set of genes originally identified as PcG genes &#x0005b;<italic>Asx</italic>, <italic>E(z)</italic>, <italic>E(Pc)</italic>, <italic>Psc</italic>, <italic>Scm and Su(z)2</italic>&#x0005d; were later found to enhance trxG phenotypes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004750-Gildea1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. Further studies suggest that these genes play dual roles in PcG-mediated transcriptional repression and trxG-mediated transcriptional activation of <italic>Hox</italic> genes. The genes were proposed to form the &#x0201c;Enhancers of trithorax and Polycomb&#x0201d; (ETP) group, which is distinct from both PcG and trxG <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004750-Gildea1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>.

Despite the importance of ETP genes in promoting PcG and trxG activity, the mechanism by which ETP proteins function is largely unknown. One hypothesis suggests that ETP proteins may help recruit PcG and trxG complexes to target chromatin. Consistent with this hypothesis, a few ETP proteins have been shown to associate with PcG complexes at least transiently <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004750-Salvaing1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004750-Djardin1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>.

Furthermore, they became lethargic and moribund as they aged, dying prematurely between 2 and 7 months. Necropsy of three moribund non-runt mutant mice showed that they have disproportionally large hearts when compared to their small body size. Histological examination found signs of myocyte disarray and interstitial fibrosis in the hearts of older, moribund mutant animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004750-g005">Fig. 5B, D</xref>), but not in age-matched control animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004750-g005">Fig. 5A, C</xref>) or in younger mutants (data not shown). This suggests that the old mutants had decreased heart function and may have experienced heart failure. We compared the heart/body weight ratio of mutant animals at various ages with that of age- and sex-matched littermates. The average heart/body weight ratios were higher in mutant animals than in control animals at all three time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004750-g005">Fig. 5E</xref>).

The increased heart/body weight ratio is unlikely an artifact of the mutant animals' growth defect, because the liver/body weight ratio is comparable between the mutant and control animals (data not shown).

The entire 1.1-kb probe may contain additional homologous sequences. Finally, <italic>Asxl2</italic> gene has been suggested to have multiple transcript isoforms. If any of the isoforms is transcribed from an alternative promoter downstream of the gene trap cassette insertion site, it would not be detected in the X-gal stainings. Further analyses, including Northern blots and <italic>in situ</italic> hybridizations using highly <italic>Asxl2</italic>-specific probes and immunohistochemistry studies of the Asxl2 protein, are needed to determine the expression pattern of endogenous <italic>Asxl2</italic> and to fully understand the discrepancy between our result and previous report.</p><p>Interesting heart phenotypes and axial skeleton phenotypes were observed in <italic>Asxl2</italic> mutant animals, suggesting that the expression of the gene trap in the heart and in the axial skeleton is probably reflective of endogenous expression and function in these tissues. Because of the strong expression of the <italic>Asxl2</italic> gene trap in the heart and in the axial skeleton, the current report characterized the heart and skeleton phenotypes in further details and focused on the heart when examining the effects of the gene trap on endogenous <italic>Asxl2</italic> transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004750-g001">Fig. 1F</xref>) and on histone modifications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004750-g005">Fig. 5F, G</xref>).</p><p>The <italic>Asxl2</italic> gene trap is expressed in the retina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004750-g002">Fig 2H</xref>); Northern blot and EST profile also suggested that <italic>Asxl2</italic> is expressed in the eye <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004750-Fisher1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>.

The loss of <italic>Asxl2</italic> activity results in partial embryonic lethality, shortened life span of adult animals, and a reduction in size and body weight.

Detailed analyses of the genetic and biochemical interactions between <italic>Asxl2</italic>, <italic>M33</italic> and <italic>Bmi-1</italic> are needed to shed light on whether and where Asxl2 regulates the function of the PRC1 complex.</p><p><italic>Asxl2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice exhibit a number of axial skeletal abnormalities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004750-g004">Fig. 4H</xref>), indicating that <italic>Asxl2</italic> has a role in the patterning of the axial skeleton, where PcG, trxG and other known ETP genes function. The trademark characteristic for ETP genes is their dual roles in promoting both PcG and trxG activities. Such dual roles have been shown for Drosophila <italic>Asx</italic>. We observed both posterior transformations (S3-&#x0003e;S4 and S2-&#x0003e;S3) and anterior transformations (T7-&#x0003e;T6 and T4-&#x0003e;T3) in <italic>Asxl2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> skeletons, suggesting that the loss of <italic>Asxl2</italic> disrupts both PcG and trxG activities in the axial skeleton (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004750-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). A compromise in PcG-associated HMTase activity was also observed in <italic>Asxl2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> hearts, which exhibit reduced global level of H3K27me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004750-g005">Fig. 5F</xref>). It has been previously shown that knockdown of E(z), the HMTase subunit of PRC2, abolishes H3K27me3 in Drosophila <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004750-Kurzhals1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>. Similarly, knocking down of EZH2, a human homolog of E(z), led to a global decrease in H3K27me3 in cancer cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004750-McGarvey1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>. We notice that while H3K27me3 is completely abolished in E(z) knockdown cells, it is significantly reduced but not abolished in EZH2 knockdown cells or in <italic>Asxl2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> hearts. A likely explanation is functional redundancy between multiple homologs in mammals. Ezh1, the other mammalian homolog for E(z), may be partially redundant with Ezh2. Similarly, Asxl1 and Asxl3 may be partially redundant with Asxl2. Alternatively, <italic>Asxl2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> hearts may have residual Asxl2 activity since the gene trap does not completely abolish wild-type <italic>Asxl2</italic> transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004750-g001">Fig. 1F</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to H3K27me3, the level of H3K4me3 did not exhibit obvious change in <italic>Asxl2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> hearts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004750-g005">Fig. 5G</xref>). This observation could suggest a tissue difference in Asxl2's function: it may regulate trxG activity in the axial skeleton but not in the heart. However, there are several alternative explanations. It is possible that Asxl2 regulates trxG activity at only a subset of trxG target loci. In this case, the loss of <italic>Asxl2</italic> may reduce H3K4me3 at the promoters of these loci without significant impact on the level of bulk H3K4me3. Testing this hypothesis will require the identification of Asxl2 target loci and he examination of local H3K4me3 levels by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP). Alternatively, Asxl2 may specifically regulate the ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling activity but not the HMTase activity of trxG complexes. It will be interesting to compare the chromatin remodeling activity of trxG complexes purified from wild-type and <italic>Asxl2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> hearts in the future. A third possibility is that there may be a division of labor among mammalian Asx-like proteins, so that Asxl2 primarily regulates PcG activity while trxG activity is primarily regulated by Asxl1 or Asxl3. This last scenario would predict that <italic>Asxl2</italic> is more essential for PcG activity than for trxG activity. Consistent with this scenario, even though both posterior transformations and anterior transformations were observed in <italic>Asxl2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> skeletons, posterior transformations have a higher penetrance (100&#x00025; for S3-&#x0003e;S4 transformation vs. 23&#x00025; for T7-&#x0003e;T6 transformation). The generation of <italic>Asxl1</italic> and <italic>Asxl3</italic> mutant animals will allow us to address the potential division of labor among Asx-like proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Role of <italic>Asxl2</italic> in the heart</title><p>A PcG gene, <italic>Rae28</italic>, has previously been shown to be required for sustaining the expression of the cardiac selector gene <italic>Nkx2.5</italic> in developing mouse embryos <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004750-Shirai1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>.

However, some <italic>Asxl2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> embryos died <italic>in utero</italic> and could have more severe phenotypes than the ones that were born. A detailed phenotypic characterization of <italic>Asxl2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> embryos is needed to answer whether Asxl2 plays a role in heart morphogenesis. The variability in survival and/or in the severity of phenotypes between individual embryos could be due to variation in residual Asxl2 activity or functional redundancy among Asx-like proteins.</p><p>In postnatal animals, cardiac function is known to be epigenetically regulated. For example, class I and class II histone deacetylases (HDACs) promote and inhibit cardiac hypertrophy, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004750-Zhang1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004750-Trivedi1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>. However, whether the PcG/trxG system plays a role in postnatal heart is unclear, partly because the embryonic lethality of many PcG/trxG mutations precluded functional study of postnatal development. The <italic>Asxl2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> animals provide a good opportunity to address this question. A molecular signature of cardiac hypertrophy is the reactivation of multiple genes that are active during fetal development but repressed in the adult heart <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004750-Durand1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>. Given the role of PcG proteins in the maintenance of silenced loci, PcG proteins could be involved in the repression of these genes in normal hearts. Two important research directions in the future will be the full characterization of the heart phenotypes of <italic>Asxl2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> animals and the study of the underlying mechanisms, especially the role of the PcG/trxG system.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Generation of <italic>Asxl2</italic> mutant mice</title><p>The AQ0356 gene trap ES cell line was purchased from the Sanger Institute.
