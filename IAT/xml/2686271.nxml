It has been proposed that <italic>Salmonella</italic> has lost <italic>lacZYA</italic> operon and <italic>lacI</italic> during evolution. In this study, we have investigated the physiological and evolutionary significance of the absence of <italic>lacI</italic> in <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic>. Using murine model of typhoid fever, we show that the expression of LacI causes a remarkable reduction in the virulence of <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic>. LacI also suppresses the ability of <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> to proliferate inside murine macrophages. Microarray analysis revealed that LacI interferes with the expression of virulence genes of <italic>Salmonella</italic> pathogenicity island 2.

Hybridization plan was as follows: WT<sub>Cy3</sub><italic>vs</italic>. pTrc99A<sub>Cy5</sub>, WT<sub>Cy5</sub><italic>vs</italic>. pTrc99A<sub>Cy3</sub>, WT<sub>Cy3</sub><italic>vs</italic>. pTrc(-LacI)<sub>Cy5</sub>, WT<sub>Cy5</sub><italic>vs</italic>. pTrc(-LacI)<sub>Cy3</sub>. Slides were scanned at 5 &#x000b5; resolution using Agilent scanner. Automated feature extraction was done using Agilent's Feature Extraction Software. Analysis of feature extracted data was done using Agilent's GeneSpring GX V 7.3.1 software. The normalization was done using GeneSpring GX using the recommended Per Chip and Per Gene Data Transformation. Genes with ratio of 2 and above were considered as up-regulated and with ratio 0.5 and below were considered down-regulated. <italic>P</italic> value was calculated by GeneSpring GX for each gene on the basis of replicate probes to indicate statistical significance. <italic>P</italic> value less than 0.02 was taken as statistically significant.
