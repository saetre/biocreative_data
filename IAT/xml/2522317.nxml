These pathways may exist to carry out distinct tasks during different stages of mitosis and likely depend on distinct molecular mechanisms. On isolated chromosomes we found microtubule nucleation/binding depended additively on both dynein/dynactin and on the Ndc80/Hec1 complex. Studying chromosome movement in living <italic>Xenopus</italic> cells within the simplified geometry of monopolar spindles we quantified the relative contributions of dynein/dynactin and the Ndc80/Hec1 complex. Inhibition of dynein/dynactin alone had minor effects but did suppress transient, rapid, poleward movements. In contrast, inhibition of the Ndc80 complex blocked normal end-on attachments of microtubules to kinetochores resulting in persistent rapid poleward movements that required dynein/dynactin. In normal cells with bipolar spindles dynein/dynactin activity on its own allowed attachment and rapid movement of chromosomes on prometaphase spindles, but failed to support metaphase alignment and chromatid movement in anaphase. Thus in prometaphase dynein/dynactin likely mediates early transient, lateral interactions of kinetochores and microtubules. However mature attachment via the Ndc80 complex is essential for metaphase alignment and anaphase A.</p></abstract><contract-num rid="GM1">R01 GM050412-14</contract-num><contract-sponsor id="GM1">National Institute of General Medical Sciences : NIGMS</contract-sponsor></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p id="P2">During cell division, chromosomes bi-orient to opposite spindle poles and chromatids segregate equally between the two progeny cells, preventing the gain or loss of chromosomes (aneuploidy) with its potentially deleterious consequences. Bi-orientation and segregation of chromosomes depend on interactions between kinetochores and microtubules. During prometaphase, kinetochores attach to microtubules and chromosomes congress to the metaphase plate. Rapid poleward chromosome movements, up to 24 &#x003bc;m/minute, can occur in the early phases of chromosome capture by spindle microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Rieder and Alexander, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Merdes and De May, 1990</xref>).</p><p id="P3">However these rapid interactions appear to give way to the mature form of the kinetochore where microtubule plus ends are embedded into the kinetochore and form the primary means of interaction as chromosomes move to align at the metaphase plate in prometaphase and as the separated chromatids move to the poles in anaphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Rieder and Alexander,1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">Merdes and De May,1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">Dong et. al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">McCleland et. al., 2004</xref>). Recently it was shown that the stable interaction of microtubules with kinetochores is mediated by a protein assembly composed of the KNL-1 protein, the Mis12 complex, and the Ndc80 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Cheeseman et. al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Wei et. al., 2007</xref>). It is hypothesized that the Ndc80 complex directly mediates attachment of kinetochores to spindle microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">Cheeseman et. al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R27">Wei et. al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Deluca et. al., 2006</xref>). Previously we showed that direct inhibition of the Ndc80 complex by antibody microinjection led to loss of most chromatid movement at anaphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">McCleland et. al., 2003</xref>). However, earlier at prometaphase in the same cells, chromosomes continued to bind to the mitotic spindle microtubules and showed oscillatory movements although normal metaphase alignment was impaired. Thus these initial studies suggested that while Ndc80 complex-dependent mechanisms appear to be required for normal anaphase chromatid movement, other mechanisms, independent of the Ndc80 complex, can foster chromosome attachment and movement in prometaphase.</p><p id="P4">In prometaphase cells, transient attachments of kinetochores to microtubules result in rapid poleward movements. These attachments may be mediated by dynein/dynactin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">Rieder and Alexander, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">King et. al., 2000</xref>). However, most evidence for dynein/dynactin in this event is indirect. Dynein accumulates on kinetochores that are not attached to microtubules and becomes depleted as initial lateral interactions of kinetochores mature into end-on attachments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">King et. al., 2000</xref>). Both the rapidity and direction of movement of chromosomes just after nuclear envelope breakdown are consistent with a role for dynein/dynactin. In the widely used model organism <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> there are 6 kinesins and dynein but capture and retrieval of distant chromosomes depends on one minus-end directed kinesin-14, Kar3p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">Tanaka et al., 2005</xref>). In <italic>S. pombe</italic>, Klp2p, also a member of the kinesin 14 subfamily, assists in chromosomes motion toward the Spindle Pole Body reportedly by promoting depolymerization of kinetochore fiber microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">Grishchuk and McIntosh, 2006</xref>). It was recently observed in budding yeast as in vertebrates that chromosomes can move along lateral surfaces of microtubules. (Tanaka et al., 2007).</p><p id="P5">A major hurdle in analysis of the role of dynein/dynactin function in mitosis is the exceptionally transient nature of initial kinetochore attachment in the early events of chromosome capture and movement in prometaphase. Under normal circumstances these initial interactions are rapidly obscured by the more robust Ndc80 complex-dependent attachments of kinetochores to microtubules. To determine the potential role for dynein/dynactin in chromosome movement in mitosis of vertebrate cells, we first blocked Ndc80 complex function and then studied the role of dynein/dynactin in a system where the directionality and velocity of chromosome movements could be unambiguously quantified. Our findings suggest that rapid movements of chromosomes on microtubules in early prometaphase are mediated by dynein/dynactin but that the attachments mediated by the Ndc80 complex are required for metaphase alignment and chromatid movement in anaphase. If dynein/dynactin plays any role in anaphase it is entirely dependent on microtubule attachment mediated through the Ndc80 complex.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S3"><title><italic>In Vitro</italic> Kinetochore-Microtubule Binding Assays</title><p id="P6">Monolayers of <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> tissue culture cells (XTC) were grown in 66% Leibovitz&#x02019;s L-15 media containing 10% fetal calf serum, 1mM sodium pyruvate and antibiotics at ~21&#x000b0;C.

When incubated at tubulin concentrations where spontaneous microtubule nucleation is slow, kinetochores of isolated chromosomes can serve to nucleate microtubule polymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">Mitchison and Kirschner, 1985</xref>). We mixed bovine brain tubulin at three different concentrations (10&#x003bc;M, 15&#x003bc;M, and 20&#x003bc;M) with chromosomes isolated from <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> XTC cells. Prior to detection of the components by immunofluorescence, we fixed and spun the chromosome-microtubule complexes onto coverslips. In control samples incubated in the presence of non-immune IgG, the average number of microtubules assembled per chromosome was 1.5 for 10&#x003bc;M tubulin, 4 for 15&#x003bc;M tubulin, and 12.9 for 20&#x003bc;M tubulin. Dynein/dynactin is found concentrated at the kinetochores of isolated Xenopus chromosomes as shown previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">McCleland et al., 2003</xref>). To inhibit the function of bound dynein/dynactin we added the protein dynamitin during the microtubule nucleation/binding assay. Dynamitin is a subunit of the dynactin complex required for cytoplasmic dynein/dynactin function. Overexpression or injection of dynamitin in living cells causes inhibition of dynein/dynactin function by disrupting the dynein/dynactin complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Echeverri et. al., 1996</xref>). To inhibit the Ndc80 complex we used function-blocking antibodies to the Ndc80 or Nuf2 proteins. Addition of either dynamitin protein or anti-Ndc80 complex antibodies decreased the number of microtubules bound to chromosomes (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>). The addition of both anti-Ndc80 antibodies and dynamitin together produced an additive effect in further reducing microtubule association with chromosomes. While the fixation, centrifugation, and labeling procedure tended to obscure our ability to precisely localize bound microtubules at the primary constriction (centromere) of the chromosomes, the fact that binding was dependent on the Ndc80 complex and on dynein/dynactin and that these proteins are concentrated at kinetochores, provided confidence that the majority of attached microtubules were in fact bound at kinetochores. In a complementary assay, preassembled, taxol-stabilized microtubules also showed an additive dependence on both dynein/dynactin and the Ndc80 complex for binding to isolated chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">Emanuele et al, 2007</xref>). Thus, isolated chromosomes contain two independent, additive activities for binding microtubules, one dependent on dynein/dynactin and the other on the Ndc80 complex.</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Quantification of directional chromosome movements dependent upon dynein/dynactin and the Ndc80 complex</title><p id="P12">Inhibition of the Ndc80 complex did not block dynein binding at kinetochores in Xenopus egg extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">McCleland et al., 2003</xref>). Consistent with this work we found that microinjection of anti-Ndc80 complex antibody did not affect dynein/dynactin association with kinetochores in cells treated with nocodazole. However, microinjection of cells with dynamitin protein significantly decreased the amount of kinetochore-bound dynein/dynactin (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). Dynein/dynactin inhibition by overexpression of dynamitin protein from transfected plasmid has also been shown to affect spindle pole organization. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">Echeverri et al., 1996</xref>). However, injection of dynamitin into mitotic cells with assembled spindles does not cause apparent disturbance of spindle poles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Howell et al., 2001</xref>). Similarly, when <italic>Xenopus</italic> S3 cells were injected with dynamitin we observed no changes in spindle pole organization by GFP-tubulin imaging in normal cells containing bipolar spindles or in cells with unseparated spindle poles that had been preincubated with Monastrol.</p><p id="P13">The anti-Ndc80 and anti-Nuf2 antibodies used in this work have been biochemically characterized in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">McCleland et al., 2003</xref>). Upon injection of these antibodies as well as antibodies to other two components of the Ndc80 complex, Spc24 and Spc25 into mitotic <italic>Xenopus</italic> S3 cells, identical responses occurred.

Thus injection of antibodies to any component of the Ndc80 complex produces an identical response, consistent with the idea that inhibition of the Ndc80 complex leads to the observed phenotypes and is not due to non-specific effects of the antibodies on other targets.</p><p id="P14">To categorize kinetochore-driven movements as being unambiguously driven by forces acting toward or away from the spindle poles and to quantify these movements, we established a system to analyze chromosome movements in mitotic cells with monopolar spindles induced by inhibition of Eg5 kinesin with Monastrol.

In contrast, cells injected with anti-Ndc80 complex antibodies exhibited significant changes in several aspects. Initially after injection, chromosomes moved to the periphery of the microtubule array. A few minutes later, chromosomes began rapid movements toward and away from the spindle poles (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3A,B</xref> and <xref rid="SD6" ref-type="supplementary-material">Movie 3</xref>). By observing GFP-tubulin in the injected cells, we differentiated two modes of poleward movement. One depended on the existing array of microtubules and another much less common occurred when a bundle of microtubules grew from the distal kinetochore and then looped back (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">Khodjakov et al., 2003</xref>). Chromosomes that moved due to the latter mechanism were excluded from the quantitative analysis.</p><p id="P17">Chromosomes in cells injected with anti-Ndc80-complex antibodies moved a greater percentage of time (17.5% increase; p&#x0226a;0.05, n=29) compared to chromosomes in cells injected with control IgG (n = 29). Chromosomes in cells injected with anti-Ndc80 complex antibody had an average velocity toward the spindle poles 2.5 times greater than that of control cells (6.5 and 2.5 &#x003bc;m/minute respectively; p&#x0226a;0.05 n=29) (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3C,D</xref>).

To test this hypothesis we co-injected dynamitin and anti-Ndc80 complex antibodies into cells.

The rapid poleward chromosome movements characteristic of cells injected with anti-Ndc80 complex antibody were severely reduced (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3D</xref>). We did observe some residual rapid poleward movements in cells injected with both Ndc80 complex antibodies and dynamitin. We attribute these residual movements to remaining activity of dynein/dynactin during observation period selected to be 15 minutes after injections. It appeared that while effects from the anti-Ndc80 complex antibodies were rapid and fully penetrant within a few minutes, the response to dynamitin injection increased with time. After approximately 30 min to one hour all residual rapid poleward movements ceased and all chromosomes became localized at the cell periphery (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Chromosome movement in cells with bipolar spindles can occur independently of the Ndc80 complex in prometaphase but not in anaphase</title><p id="P19">Consistent with our previously published observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">McCleland et. al., 2003</xref>) as well as those of others in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">Deluca et. al., 2006</xref>), in cells where the Ndc80 complex is compromised, kinetochores of chromosomes continue to associate with spindle microtubules during prometaphase in the absence of stable end-on attachment (<xref rid="F5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5A, B</xref>, <xref rid="SD8" ref-type="supplementary-material">Movies 5</xref>, <xref rid="SD9" ref-type="supplementary-material">6</xref>). In our study of cells with bipolar spindles we found that chromosomes gather near the center of the mitotic spindle but do not undergo full metaphase alignment. Because injection with anti-Ndc80 complex antibodies overrides the mitotic spindle checkpoint, the injected cells proceed to anaphase. However, while sister chromatids separate, no poleward movement of chromatids takes place. Thus, as in cells with monopolar spindles, the chromosomes in cells with bipolar spindles exhibit kinetochore-driven movements in prometaphase that are independent of the Ndc80 complex. However in anaphase, while the Ndc80 complex function is essential for chromosome movement to the poles, dynein/dynactin-dependent motility is apparently switched off or, if it functions at all, it can do so only in the presence of active Ndc80 complex.

The chromosomes came to exhibit a wrinkled or &#x0201c;accordion-like&#x0201d; morphology. This morphology could be explained by small residual movements of chromosomes after inhibition of both Ndc80 complex and dynein/dynactin, or through interactions of microtubules with chromosome arms, likely mediated by microtubule assembly and disassembly or by chromatin-associated motor molecules such as chromokinesins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">Wang and Adler, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">Brouhard and Hunt, 2005</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="S13"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P22">Although rapid poleward chromosome movements in early prometaphase were observed several years ago, it has been difficult to dissect the molecular basis of this chromosome motility. The primary difficulty in analyzing the initial rapid poleward movements of chromosomes on the spindle microtubules is the transient nature of this activity. In order to prolong and sustain the rapid chromosomal movements we disrupted Ndc80 complex, responsible for stable attachment of chromosomes, and kept cells in M phase by addition of proteasome inhibitor. In this way we dissociated the transient associations of kinetochores with spindle microtubules at early prometaphase from the mature Ndc80-dependent binding of microtubules to kinetochores. Abrogation of the Ndc80 complex during prometaphase blocks stable attachment resulting in sustained dynein/dynactin-dependent kinetochore motility in prometaphase cells. In such cells, chromosomes exhibited increased rapid poleward movement but could not stably attach to spindle microtubules nor form a compact metaphase plate in cells with bipolar spindles. At anaphase in cells where the Ndc80 complex is inhibited, chromatids separate but lose all attachment to the anaphase spindle. Based on GFP-tubulin, the anaphase spindle appears normal but lacks kinetochore fiber bundles. Spindle pole separation (anaphase B) occurs normally. These observations show that at anaphase onset, dynein/dynactin activity is either silenced or is of itself incapable of maintaining kinetochore attachment to anaphase spindle microtubules in the absence of functional Ndc80 complex.</p><p id="P23">In order to quantify chromosome movements we inhibited the kinesin Eg5 by addition of Monastrol. Inhibition of Eg5 led to the formation of cells with monopolar spindles and a simplified geometry for measuring poleward and anti-poleward movements of chromosomes. Our analysis shows that inhibition of the Ndc80 complex led to a significant increase in overall chromosomal movements with a noticeable increase in rapid (&#x0003e; 10 &#x003bc;m/min) poleward movements. To test whether these rapid poleward movements unmasked by inhibition of the Ndc80 complex were dependent on dynein/dynactin, we injected dynamitin protein. In the presence of dynamitin, the rapid poleward movements were largely repressed.</p><p id="P24">A recent study postulated a role for dynein in rapid poleward chromosome movements seen in cells during washout of microtubule-disrupting drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Yang et. al., 2007</xref>). In the majority of the results reported by Yang et al. dynein activity was perturbed though a multiple day siRNA treatment against ZW10, a member of the Rod/ZW10/Zwilch complex, a dynein-associated protein assembly thought to be involved in silencing of the mitotic spindle checkpoint. In addition, the ZW10 knockdown was reported to inhibit metaphase alignment and to result in a slower anaphase and an increase in lagging chromatids.</p><p id="P25">In injections of dynamitin protein in 7 <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> S3 cells with bipolar spindles we did not observe defects in metaphase alignment or slowed or lagging chromatids at anaphase (data not shown). Our results are consistent with a study of the effects of dynein/dynactin inhibition with dynamitin reported in mammalian cells by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">Howell et al. (2001)</xref>. We suspect that the slightly differing results on metaphase alignment obtained by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R31">Yang et al. (2007)</xref> may be due to different methods used to compromise dynein/dynactin activity. The more far reaching effects seen after siRNA knockdown of Zw10 may reflect the fact that the Rod/Zw10/Zwilch complex may participate in functions beyond regulation of dynein at the kinetochore. The Rod/Zw10/Zwilch proteins are required for checkpoint function and have been implicated in Golgi transport in interphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">Chan et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">Williams et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">Hirose et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">Varma et al., 2006</xref>). Dynein has also been implicated in chromosome movement in Drosophila. Loss of rapid prometaphase movements, asynchronous chromatid separation and slowed anaphase were reported in Drosophila spermatocytes of Zw10 and Rod mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">Savoian et al., 2000</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">Sharp et al. (2000)</xref> reported that dynamitin or anti-dynein injections perturbed metaphase alignment and slowed chromatid movement in Drosophila embryos.</p><p id="P26">Nevertheless, to corroborate the results we obtained by dynamitin injection in vertebrate cells, we also compared the effects of inhibiting the RZZ complex by microinjection of antibody to Xenopus Zwilch protein. We found that anti-Zwilch had little effect on chromosome movement when injected alone (n = 5 cells) but led to significant loss of chromosome movement when injected along with anti-Ndc80 complex antibodies (n = 9 cells) (<xref rid="SD1" ref-type="supplementary-material">Supplemental Fig. S2</xref> and <xref rid="SD2" ref-type="supplementary-material">Movie 10</xref>). Similar to the effects of dynamitin, anti-Zwilch antibody abrogated the rapid movements that normally occur after inhibition of the Ndc80 complex and many chromosomes in the co-injected cells eventually came lie along the cell periphery, a terminal stage very similar to that seen when cells were co-injected with anti-Ndc80 complex antibodies and dynamitin. As in the case of dynamitin, we did not detect perturbations of microtubule association with spindle poles in normal cells with bipolar spindles or in cells treated with Monastrol.</p><p id="P27">Our experiments in Xenopus cells show that when the Ndc80 complex is inhibited, chromosomes in prometaphase continue to attach and move on spindle microtubules. These data are consistent with the idea that initial dynein/dynactin-driven movements mediate lateral attachments that are rapidly converted to Ndc80 complex-dependent end-on attachments. End-on attachments appear to be dominant over lateral. This dominance is likely due to decreased concentration of dynein/dyanctin at kinetochores after stable microtubule attachment. In contrast, levels of Ndc80 complex remain high at kinetochores. In budding yeast, recent studies indicate that kinetochores also associate with microtubules by both lateral attachment and end-on attachment (Tanaka et al., 2007). However the protein implicated in lateral attachment is not dynein but rather the kinesin-14 member, Kar3. In fission yeast, although the issue of lateral versus end-on attachment was not directly addressed, results suggest that neither the minus-end motors of the kinesin-14 class (Pkl1p and Klp2p) nor dynein are required for chromosome biorientation and congression but contribute to fidelity of chromosome segregation through roles in maintaining the organization of spindle poles (Grischuk et al., 2007).</p><p id="P28">In summary, in a cell free system, microtubules appear to associate with kinetochores through two independent mechanisms, one that requires the Ndc80 complex and another that relies on dynein/dynactin. In living cells, abrogation of the Ndc80 complex by antibody microinjection, leads to protracted expression of rapid dynein/dynactin-dependent poleward movements of kinetochores on spindle microtubules during prometaphase. These movements closely mimic the rapid poleward movement of chromosomes seen transiently just after nuclear envelope breakdown. However under normal circumstances mature attachments via the Ndc80 complex supplant transient attachment. In the absence of functional Ndc80 complex, these dynein/dynactin-based movements persist but can not generate chromosome alignment at the metaphase plate nor any chromatid motion in anaphase. Instead the Ndc80 complex-dependent attachments are absolutely required for metaphase alignment and anaphase A movement of chromatids to the poles. This study lends important new information concerning the molecular nature of kinetochore motility activities and their precise regulation during the mitotic cell cycle.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="S14"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><label>1</label><caption><title>Supplemental Figure 1</title><p id="P29">Inhibition of the Ndc80 complex prevents chromosome segregation upon anaphase induction.
