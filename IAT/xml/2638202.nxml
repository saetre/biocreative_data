Mutational analysis based on the known structure reveals several key residues required for coupling H<sup>+</sup> to the stoichiometric countermovement of Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup>. E148 (Glu<sub>ex</sub>) transfers protons between extracellular water and the protein interior, and E203 (Glu<sub>in</sub>) is thought to function analogously on the intracellular face of the protein. Mutation of either residue eliminates H<sup>+</sup> transport while preserving Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> transport. We tested the role of Glu<sub>in</sub> by examining structural and functional properties of mutants at this position. Certain dissociable side chains (E, D, H, K, R, but not C and Y) retain H<sup>+</sup>/Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> exchanger activity to varying degrees, while other mutations (V, I, or C) abolish H<sup>+</sup> coupling and severely inhibit Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> flux. Transporters substituted with other nonprotonatable side chains (Q, S, and A) show highly impaired H<sup>+</sup> transport with substantial Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> transport. Influence on H<sup>+</sup> transport of side chain length and acidity was assessed using a single-cysteine mutant to introduce non-natural side chains. Crystal structures of both coupled (E203H) and uncoupled (E203V) mutants are similar to wild type. The results support the idea that Glu<sub>in</sub> is the internal proton-transfer residue that delivers protons from intracellular solution to the protein interior, where they couple to Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> movements to bring about Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchange.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Membrane proteins of the ubiquitous CLC family operate in varied physiological contexts, calling for transmembrane movement of inorganic anions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Jentsch, 2008</xref>). These proteins segregate into two distinct mechanistic subtypes: Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup>-specific channels and proton-coupled Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> (or, in plants, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#x02212;</sup>) exchangers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Zifarelli and Pusch, 2007</xref>). The channels have been studied electrophysiologically for many years, but the exchange transporters, recently recognized, are understood only in fuzzy mechanistic outline. Built as homodimers in which each subunit operates as a full-fledged exchanger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Nguitragool and Miller, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Zdebik et al., 2008</xref>), these proteins swap substrate ions across the membrane in opposite directions with a stoichiometry of two Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> ions per H<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Accardi and Miller, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">DeAngeli et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Nguitragool and Miller, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Graves et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Miller and Nguitragool, 2009</xref>). The x-ray crystal structure of CLC-ec1 from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, the only structurally known CLC, provides a view of the physical pathways by which Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> and H<sup>+</sup> move through proteins of this family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dutzler et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Miller, 2006</xref>). A mechanistic scheme for how these movements are coordinated has recently been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Miller and Nguitragool, 2009</xref>).</p><p>Coupled Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> transport uses two strictly conserved glutamates near the protein&#x02019;s extracellular or intracellular surfaces to transfer protons between the proximate aqueous solutions and the protein interior (E148 and E203 in CLC-ec1, denoted Glu<sub>ex</sub> and Glu<sub>in</sub>, respectively). Substituting either of these residues with nonprotonatable side chains eliminates H<sup>+</sup> but retains Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Accardi and Miller, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Accardi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Picollo and Pusch, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Scheel et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Jayaram et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Zdebik et al., 2008</xref>). The proton-transfer function of Glu<sub>ex</sub> is well established experimentally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dutzler et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Accardi and Miller, 2004</xref>): the side chain acts as a &#x0201c;gate&#x0201d; that blocks off the extracellular end of the Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> pathway when deprotonated and swings away upon protonation to open this pathway to the outside. But the role of Glu<sub>in</sub> on the intracellular side is not so clear. It is known that this is the only internally facing carboxyl group that when mutated away abolishes H<sup>+</sup> transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Accardi et al., 2005</xref>), and a recent molecular dynamics simulation suggests that a side chain rotation of Glu<sub>in</sub> is required for transferring H<sup>+</sup> into the proton pathway (Voth, G., personal communication); but no such structural rearrangement of Glu<sub>in</sub> has been observed crystallographically. Further experimental scrutiny is therefore needed to test the idea that this residue is an intracellular H<sup>+</sup> transfer catalyst. Now, by examining an expanded panel of mutations at Glu<sub>in</sub>, we show that Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchange is supported only by protonatable side chains, both acidic and basic, and that non-dissociable side chains produce uncoupled Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> transporters with a wide range of absolute rates. These results agree in outline, but not in all details, with similar experiments on mammalian CLC exchangers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Zdebik et al., 2008</xref>), and they corroborate the proposal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Accardi et al., 2005</xref>) that Glu<sub>in</sub> shuttles protons between the intracellular solution and the still unknown internal workings of the exchanger.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Biochemical Procedures</title><p>Chemicals were of the highest grade available. Fluoro-iodoacetic acid (FIAA) was obtained from American Custom Chemicals, methanethiosulfonate compounds were from Toronto Research Chemicals, detergents were from Anatrace, and phospholipids were from Avanti Polar Lipids, Inc. Protein purification and reconstitution procedures were, with minor modifications, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Accardi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Walden et al., 2007</xref>). In brief, mutants of CLC-ec1 (GenBank accession no. <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="P37019">P37019</ext-link>), His<sub>6</sub> tagged at the C terminus, were constructed by PCR mutagenesis, and the full coding sequence was confirmed. These were expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic>, extracted in decylmaltoside (DM), and partially purified on Co-affinity beads (BD) by sequentially washing with 10&#x02013;20 column volumes of wash buffer (WB; 100 mM NaCl, 20 mM tris-Cl, and 5 mM DM, pH 7.5), 10 vol of WB containing 20 mM imidazole, 10 vol of high salt WB (1 M NaCl, 20 mM tris-Cl, and 5 mM DM, pH 7.5), and 10 vol of WB. Protein was eluted with WB containing 400 mM imidazole, and the His tag was removed by a 1-h digestion with lysine endoproteinase C (0.05 U/mg protein; Roche). Protein was further purified by anion-exchange chromatography (Poros HQ; Applied Biosystems) for planar lipid bilayer experiments or gel filtration (Superdex 200) for liposome flux assays and for structure determination. Purified protein was reconstituted at various protein densities (0.2&#x02013;50 &#x000b5;g/mg lipid) into liposomes formed by detergent dialysis from <italic>E. coli</italic> phospholipids and stored at 20 mg lipid/ml at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C in aliquots.

Various electrophilic reagents were reacted at pH 8.0 with this protein to form the desired side chain adducts: iodoacetic acid (IAA), FIAA, 2-carboxylethyl methanethiosulfonate, and 2-sulfonatoethyl methanethiosulfonate. Reactions were monitored quantitatively with the Ellman reagent, as described for this protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Nguitragool and Miller, 2007</xref>). Protein samples were passed through Superdex 200 equilibrated with 50 mM NaCl, 50 mM NaP<sub>i</sub>, and 5 mM DM, pH 8.0, and four shots of 1 mM MTS reagent was added at 15-min intervals. Reactions with 100 mM IAA or FIAA were run for 20 or 32 h, respectively. Reactions were terminated by gel filtration in 100 mM tris-Cl, 3 mM EDTA, and 5 mM DM, pH 8.0.

Proton pumping used liposomes with high protein density (5.0 &#x000b5;g protein/mg lipid) loaded with 300 mM KCl and 40 mM citrate, pH 5.0. After thawing, liposomes were extruded with a 0.4-&#x000b5;m filter; just before each run, a 100-&#x000b5;l liposome sample was centrifuged through a 1.5-ml G-50 column equilibrated in pump buffer (290 mM K-isethionate, 10 mM KCl, and 2 mM glutamate, pH 5.2) to establish a Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> gradient. The liposomes were added to 1.8 ml of pump buffer in a stirred cell with pH continuously monitored with a glass electrode, and H<sup>+</sup> pumping was triggered by the addition of 0.5 &#x000b5;g/ml valinomycin (Vln).

Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> efflux was initiated by Vln and FCCP (0.5 &#x000b5;g/ml each), and at the end of the run, total trapped Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> was determined by disrupting liposomes with 50 mM &#x003b2;-octylglucoside. Transport turnover rate was calculated by the initial velocity method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Walden et al., 2007</xref>), using a 75-&#x000b5;M Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> addition to calibrate each experiment.</p></sec><sec><title>Electrical Recording in Planar Lipid Bilayers</title><p>Ionic currents mediated by CLC-ec1 were recorded as described in detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Accardi et al., 2004</xref>).

Families of 1-s voltage pulses from &#x02212;100 to +100 mV in 10-mV increments were applied from a holding potential of zero voltage.

The proposal that Glu<sub>in</sub> acts as an essential H<sup>+</sup> shuttle makes a strong prediction: any nonprotonatable residue substituted here should prevent H<sup>+</sup> from participating in the transport cycle; such substitutions might affect the absolute rate of Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> transport, but any Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> flux remaining should be &#x0201c;uncoupled,&#x0201d; i.e., purely passive and unaccompanied by H<sup>+</sup> movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Walden et al., 2007</xref>).

In both mutant structures, as with WT, the dehydrated central Br<sup>&#x02212;</sup> ion is occluded, blocked toward the extracellular side by the deprotonated Glu<sub>ex</sub> carboxylate, and toward the intracellular by an inner gate formed by S107 and Y445 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Jayaram et al., 2008</xref>).

In contrast, in the well-coupled His mutant, R28 side chain density appears in precisely the same position as in WT, now with a guanidinium nitrogen within respectable H-bonding distance (3.1 &#x000c5;) of a His imidazole nitrogen, presumably deprotonated. It is therefore tempting to suppose that an intimate interaction between the proton-transfer group and R28&#x02014;a salt bridge in WT or a hydrogen bond in the His mutant&#x02014;is required for an efficient transport cycle; but that idea swiftly collapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Accardi et al., 2005</xref>) with the &#x0201c;negative result&#x0201d; that R28L displays WT-like coupling and Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> turnover rate, as we have also confirmed with R28Q and R28E (not depicted).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>These experiments are simply summarized. Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchange transport in CLC-ec1 occurs only if the Glu<sub>in</sub> position carries a protonatable group. The chemical nature of the proton-competent side chains is remarkably wide-ranging: WT coupling by carboxyls on Glu, Asp, and by imidazole nitrogen on His, partial coupling by carboxyls of long-chain Cys adducts, by the primary amine of Lys, and even by guanidinium of Arg. Such variety in side chain size, shape, charge, and pK<italic><sub>a</sub></italic> is unanticipated for a key mechanistic residue, but it highlights the one feature common to all competent side chains: an ability to bind and release protons, a fundamental requirement for proton transfer. This capability is necessary but not sufficient, as no side chain lacking a dissociable group supports H<sup>+</sup> movement, but several protonatable moieties (thiol, phenol, and sulfonate) fail in this task.</p><p>Another pattern emerging here is that the absolute rate of Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> transport correlates impressively, although imperfectly, with the degree of H<sup>+</sup> coupling. The fully coupled transporters are fast, 1,000&#x02013;2,000 s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, whereas the uncoupled variants move Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> at 2&#x02013;30% of the WT rate. Inhibited turnover in uncoupled exchangers is unsurprising for mechanisms in which protonation is linked to Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> binding and conformational change; mutants inept at moving protons through the protein interior could jam the transport cycle and thereby provide Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> ions with rare opportunities to slip passively through the protein&#x02019;s anion pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Walden et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Jayaram et al., 2008</xref>). It is particularly intriguing that the Val substitution shows the slowest Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> flux of all because this residue appears at the equivalent position in all known channel-type CLC homologues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Accardi et al., 2005</xref>). The segregation of CLC channels carrying Val and exchangers carrying Glu is mirrored in the &#x0223c;600 CLC sequences in the current Uniprot database, which fall into &#x0201c;Glu&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;Val&#x0201d; subtypes, with infrequent exceptions (Table S3).</p><p>These results on a bacterial exchanger are largely harmonious with similar experiments on the equivalent position in two human homologues, CLC-4 and CLC-5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Zdebik et al., 2008</xref>). In that study, Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> /H<sup>+</sup> antiport occurred with E, D, H, or Y at the Glu<sub>in</sub> position, but not with A, R, V, C, M, and N; moreover, mutants failing in H<sup>+</sup> transport also failed in Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> transport. With CLC-ec1, however, we observe Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> transport in all H<sup>+</sup>-uncoupled mutants, albeit at lowered rates. This apparent discrepancy between the bacterial and eukaryotic CLCs is not serious because the CLC-4/CLC-5 experiments used voltage clamp recording in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes, which might miss slow, uncoupled Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> transport buried in the background &#x0201c;leak&#x0201d; currents intrinsic to the recording system. However, the H<sup>+</sup> transport activity seen in the Tyr mutant of the human CLCs appears to be a real difference between the homologues, as the liposome assay used here would have picked up comparable proton-pumping activity.</p><p>This survey of proton transfer on the intracellular side of CLC-ec1 expands previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Accardi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Zdebik et al., 2008</xref>) and buttresses the idea that the carboxyl group of Glu<sub>in</sub> does indeed act as a H<sup>+</sup> shuttle essential for coupling ion movements in CLC exchangers. However, the details of the H<sup>+</sup> transfer step itself remain vague. A central issue, conspicuous by our ignorance about it, is the pathway taken by the proton after it leaves Glu<sub>in</sub> on its way to Glu<sub>ex</sub> &#x0223c;15 &#x000c5; away. We previously argued (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Accardi et al., 2006</xref>) that the central Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> ion itself, located halfway between these two glutamates, acts as a critical way station in the proton pathway. But this still leaves &#x0223c;8 &#x000c5; of nominally nonpolar distance that the proton must traverse to reach that site. A recent molecular dynamics study (Voth, G., personal communication) observes that upon protonation in silico, Glu<sub>in</sub> rotates toward the central Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> as several intracellular water molecules enter to mediate the required H<sup>+</sup> transfer. Although experimental work is currently silent on whether such a side chain rearrangement actually occurs in proteo, a mechanism like this would neatly account for proton transfer on the intracellular side of CLC exchangers.</p><p>It is also worthwhile to puzzle over the pH dependence of Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> turnover, which is unexpectedly insensitive to the pK<italic><sub>a</sub></italic> of the intracellular H<sup>+</sup> transfer residue. Previous work showed that Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> flux varies with pH in response to titration of the extracellular proton-transfer gate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Accardi et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">2005</xref>). We infer from this that ion transport is rate limited by the extracellular H<sup>+</sup> transfer step (which is linked to conformational rearrangement of Glu<sub>ex</sub>), and that intracellular H<sup>+</sup> transfer must be much faster than this. Only when intracellular H<sup>+</sup> transfer is severely compromised, as by the nonprotonatable or highly acidic/basic side chains described here, does its influence on Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> transport become apparent.</p><p>The results set the stage for attacking future questions about how protons move between solvent and Glu<sub>in</sub>. This is not a trivial process. In crystal structures, the side chain at this position, although physically close to solvent, is not directly exposed to it. Rather, it is covered by the N-terminal helix from the twin subunit in the homodimer. If this helix were sufficiently mobile, direct protonation of Glu<sub>in</sub> from solvent could occur; alternatively, solvent protons might first bind to carboxylates located nearby on the water-exposed surface, as in the &#x0201c;proton antennas&#x0201d; that accelerate proton-transfer steps above the formal diffusion limit in membrane proteins, such as photosynthetic reaction centers or cytochrome c oxidase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">&#x000c4;delroth and Brzezinski, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Br&#x000e4;nden et al., 2006</xref>). Experimental evidence on CLC exchangers is still too primitive to address possibilities like this. In any case, because the H<sup>+</sup> transport rate of CLC-ec1, &#x0223c;1,000 s<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> at pH 4.5, is approximately three orders of magnitude below the diffusion limit, no special mechanisms need be invoked for the protein to achieve its biological purpose: facilitating extreme acid resistance in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Iyer et al., 2002</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Supplemental Material Index</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="jgp.200810112_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="jgp.200810112_1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank the X29A beamline staff at the National Synchrotron Light Source, Brookhaven National Laboratories, where crystallographic data collection was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy (contract no.
