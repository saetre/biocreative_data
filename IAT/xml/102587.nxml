We have cloned all the 12 genes, <italic>rpb1</italic>&#x02013;<italic>rpb12</italic>, coding for these subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd204c1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd204c7">7</xref>). Among them the largest and the second largest subunits, Rpb1 and Rpb2, have sequence similarities with the &#x003b2;&#x02032; and the &#x003b2; subunits of prokaryotic RNA polymerase, respectively. Rpb3 and Rpb11 show limited similarities with the N-terminal domain of &#x003b1; subunit. The four subunits, Rpb1, Rpb2, Rpb3 and Rpb11, are therefore supposed to form an enzyme core which corresponds to the core enzyme, &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>&#x003b2;&#x003b2;&#x02032;, of the prokaryotic RNA polymerase. In the presence of 6 M ures, the purified <italic>S.pombe</italic> Pol II dissociates forming an Rpb2&#x02013;Rpb3&#x02013;Rpb11 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd204c8">8</xref>), which is equivalent to the assembly intermediate, &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>&#x003b2;, of prokaryotic RNA polymerases. Furthermore, the two large subunits (Rpb1 and Rpb2) interact with DNA in <italic>S.pombe</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd204c8">8</xref>), human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd204c9">9</xref>) and <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd204c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd204c11">11</xref>), as is the case with &#x003b2; and &#x003b2;&#x02032; subunits. We have mapped the regions which form the active center of RNA polymerization within these two subunits by photo-crosslinking of nascent RNA 3&#x02032; end to the enzyme and peptide mapping of the crosslinked subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd204c12">12</xref>).</p><p>The function and structure of other eukaryotic Pol II subunits have been studied mainly using the enzyme from <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>. RPB4, which is essential in the stress response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd204c13">13</xref>), is dissociable as a complex with the RPB7 from Pol II. The Rpb4&#x02013;Rpb7 complex can stimulate the initiation of transcription at certain promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd204c14">14</xref>). Electron crystallography showed a more closed cleft structure for <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> Pol II with RPB4 and RPB7 than the enzyme without these two subunits, suggesting that RPB4 and&#x0002f;or RPB7 play a role in the conformational transition of the enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd204c15">15</xref>). RPB5 plays a role in transcriptional activation at some promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd204c16">16</xref>) and is considered to be located near the template DNA in the initiation complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd204c9">9</xref>). A direct interaction has been reported between the human RPB5 and hepatitis B virus X protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd204c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd204c18">18</xref>). The yeast RPB6, one of the common subunits of Pol I, II and III, is required for the RNA synthesis activity at least in Pol I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd204c19">19</xref>). RPB9 plays roles in transcription elongation through arrest sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd204c20">20</xref>), as well as in selection of accurate start sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd204c21">21</xref>). A high resolution NMR structure was solved for the RPB8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd204c22">22</xref>).</p><p>Except for the fragmentary knowledge of the functions of each subunit, the structure&#x02013;function organization within Pol II complexes still remains unclear. To elucidate the functional organization, we have analyzed the subunit&#x02013;subunit interactions within the <italic>S.pombe</italic> Pol II by chemical crosslinking and Far-western blotting. The results indicate that all small subunits interact with Rpb1 and&#x0002f;or Rpb2; there are also six combinations of pairwise interactions between small subunits: Rpb3&#x02013;Rpb5, Rpb3&#x02013;Rpb10, Rpb3&#x02013;Rpb11, Rpb5&#x02013;Rpb6, Rpb6&#x02013;Rpb7 and Rpb6&#x02013;Rpb8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd204c23">23</xref>). We also mapped the Rpb5-contact site on the Rpb1 and the Rpb3-contact site on the Rpb2 using a yeast two-hybrid system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd204c24">24</xref>). Reconstitutions of the Rpb3&#x02013;Rpb11 heterodimer in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> and <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd204c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd204c26">26</xref>) and the Rpb4&#x02013;Rpb7 heterodimer in <italic>A.thaliana</italic>, <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd204c27">27</xref>), human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd204c28">28</xref>) and <italic>S.pombe</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd204c7">7</xref>) have been reported. Moreover, all possible combinations of pairwise interactions between human subunits expressed in insect cells have been analyzed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd204c29">29</xref>). However, these subunit&#x02013;subunit interactions were limited in a sense that they only showed interactions between two subunits, except in the case with Rpb5, which stimulates the Rpb3&#x02013;Rpb11 heterodimer formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd204c30">30</xref>). Here we present the formation of multi-protein complexes of Pol II subunits in insect cells expressing the recombinant subunit proteins. Our results indicate that multiple contacts among the subunits are involved in the formation of stable Pol II.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Construction of an <italic>S.pombe</italic> strain carrying the GST&#x02013;<italic>rpb3</italic> gene</title><p>A plasmid pUC-GSTrpb3-ura4 was constructed by replacing the decahistidine (His<sub>10</sub>)-tag sequence between the <italic>Nhe</italic>I and <italic>Apa</italic>I sites in pUC-rpb3H-ura4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd204c8">8</xref>) with a DNA fragment of glutathione <italic>S</italic>-transferase (GST) sequence which was amplified by PCR using plasmid pGEX-4X-1 (Pharmacia) as a template and 5&#x02032;- and 3&#x02032;-primers carrying an <italic>Nhe</italic>I and <italic>Apa</italic>I sequence, respectively.

Plasmid pFastBac1 with a polyhedrin promoter or pFastBac&#x02122;DUAL with a polyhedrin and a p10 promoter was used for construction of the donor plasmids.

In order to analyze the assembly mechanism of these 11 subunits, we attempted to isolate subunit complexes from the extracts of insect cells coinfected with various combinations of the recombinant baculovirus vectors, each carrying one or two of the subunit cDNAs. Because the &#x003b1;-subunit, the prokaryotic counterpart of Rpb3, plays a central role in the assembly of prokaryotic RNA polymerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd204c31">31</xref>), we used GST&#x02013;Rpb3 fusion protein, in which GST is fused to the N-terminus of Rpb3, as an anchor subunit for the affinity pull-down assays of <italic>S.pombe</italic> Pol II subunit complexes.</p><p>To confirm that the addition of GST to Rpb3 does not interfere with the Pol II assembly, we constructed an <italic>S.pombe</italic> haploid strain in which the <italic>rpb3</italic> gene on the chromosome was replaced by the sequence encoding the GST&#x02013;Rpb3 fusion protein. Pol II could be isolated from cell extract of this strain through GSH-affinity chromatography. The purified Pol II fraction contained all 12 subunits (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd204f1">1</xref>), indicating that the addition of GST did not interfere with Pol II assembly. Furthermore, the GST&#x02013;Pol II sustains essential functions for cell growth because the strain with the GST&#x02013;<italic>rpb3</italic> gene in place of wild-type <italic>rpb3</italic> is viable.</p><p>For isolation of subunits associated with Rpb1, a His<sub>10</sub>-tag sequence was inserted in the <italic>rpb1</italic> cDNA at the immediate upstream of CTD. The recombinant Rpb1 product was designated as Rpb1H. The insertion of His<sub>10</sub>-tag into Rpb1 does not interfere with the subunit assembly as we have shown previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd204c8">8</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Expression of the subunit proteins using the baculovirus vectors</title><p>The 18 species of the recombinant baculovirus and the donor plasmids used for recombinant virus construction are listed in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkd204tb1">1</xref>. Twelve viruses, Bv1H to Bv12, each carrying one of the 11 subunit cDNAs under the control of the polyhedrin or the p10 promoter were constructed. A recombinant virus Bv1&#x00394;C carrying the <italic>rpb1</italic> cDNA without both the CTD and the His<sub>10</sub>-tag was also constructed. The other six viruses, Bv2&#x0002f;10 to Bv12&#x0002f;8, have a pair of cDNAs, and each cDNA was inserted so as to express independently under the control of the polyhedrin or the p10 promoter. As a control for expression of Rpb11 and the GST in place of the GST&#x02013;Rpb3 fusion protein, the virus BvG&#x0002f;11 was constructed.</p><p>To minimize the number of virus species for coinfection, the viruses with two cDNAs were preferentially used. The expression of each subunit protein was detected by western blotting of whole cell lysates using antisera against each subunit. A cell lysate prepared from the cells infected with a baculovirus which expresses a non-Pol II protein, &#x003b2;-glucuronidase, exhibited no immunostained signal by any one of the anti-subunit antisera used (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd204f2">2</xref>A, lane 1), indicating that the antisera cross-react with none of the cellular or viral proteins.</p></sec><sec><title>Simultaneous expression and assembly of 11 Pol II subunits</title><p>To express the 11 subunits simultaneously in the same cells, an Sf9 culture was coinfected with six species of recombinant virus, Bv1H, Bv2&#x0002f;10, BvG3&#x0002f;11, Bv5&#x0002f;6, Bv7&#x0002f;9 and Bv12&#x0002f;8. Western blotting of the infected cell lysate indicated that all 11 subunits were successfully expressed albeit at different levels (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd204f2">2</xref>A, lane 3) with the expression of Rpb1 and Rpb2 being the lowest as judged by silver staining (data not shown). The coexpression of GST, in place of GST&#x02013;Rpb3, with the other 10&#x000a0;subunits was also successful (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd204f2">2</xref>A, lane 2), in which the expression of GST was confirmed by silver staining of the electrophoresis gel after GSH-affinity chromatography (data not shown).</p><p>To examine the assembly state, the cell extracts were subjected to GSH-affinity column chromatography and the subunit proteins bound to GST&#x02013;Rpb3 were eluted with GSH-buffer and identified by western blotting (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd204f2">2</xref>B). No subunit protein was detected in the eluted fraction of the control extract with GST expression in place of GST&#x02013;Rpb3 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd204f2">2</xref>B, lane 14). In contrast, at least six subunits, Rpb1H, Rpb2, Rpb5, Rpb7, Rpb8 and Rpb11, were clearly detected in addition to the GST&#x02013;Rpb3 in the GSH-eluted fraction from the cells in which all 11 subunits were coexpressed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd204f2">2</xref>B, lane 15), indicating that these seven subunits formed assemblies in the virus-infected cells. Though the coinfected cell lysate contained various species of degradation products of Rpb1H, only the intact Rpb1H protein was detected in the subunit assemblies co-eluted with GST&#x02013;Rpb3 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd204f2">2</xref>C), indicating that the assemblies detected in this assay represent specific complexes, and not artificial aggregates.</p><p>The four subunits, Rpb6, Rpb9, Rpb10 and Rpb12, were not immunodetected in the eluted fraction, although they were present in the column-loaded extract (data not shown). This implies that: (i) these four subunits were not assembled into the complex; (ii) these subunits were assembled but at low efficiencies below the detection level; or (iii) these subunits were dissociated during the isolation of subunit assemblies.</p></sec><sec><title>Characterization of the sub-assemblies</title><p>In order to elucidate the assembly mode, we have examined a total of 10 combinations of subunit, each lacking one other than GST&#x02013;Rpb3. In all the combinations tested, all 10 subunits were successfully expressed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd204f2">2</xref>A, lanes 4&#x02013;13), implying that none of the present subunits depend on other subunits for expression. After GSH-affinity purification, the six subunits among the seven subunits, Rpb1H, Rpb2, GST&#x02013;Rpb3, Rpb5, Rpb7, Rpb8 and Rpb11, were always detected in the assembly fractions, except for the omitted subunit (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd204f2">2</xref>B, lanes 16&#x02013;25). The results indicate that the omission of any one of the six subunits does not interfere with the assembly of the other sub-units to GST&#x02013;Rpb3. Thus, two possible mechanisms can be suggested: (i) each of the six subunits binds to Rpb3 independently; and&#x0002f;or (ii) the seven subunits form a network involving multiple contacts.</p><p>Since Rpb1H contains a His<sub>10</sub>-tag, we further characterized the sub-assemblies eluted from the GSH-column by successive Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-affinity chromatography. The sub-assemblies were retained on the Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>&#x02013;agarose column and all the seven subunits were recovered in the imidazole eluted fraction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd204f3">3</xref>A, lane 4). When the Rpb1&#x00394;C lacking both the His<sub>10</sub>-tag and the CTD was coexpressed with the other 10 subunits, assemblies containing the same set of seven subunits were obtained by GSH-affinity chromatography (lane 1), but none of the subunit proteins bound to the Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> resin (lane 3). These observations indicate that the sub-assemblies containing both GST&#x02013;Rpb3 and the Rpb1H also contain Rpb2, Rpb5, Rpb7, Rpb8 and Rpb11. However, after the Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-affinity chromatography, the recovery of the other six subunits was lower than that of Rpb1H. In particular, the reduction of Rpb2 was more than that of the other five subunits. It is feasible, therefore, that Rpb2 is associated with only a small portion of the subunit complexes. The recovery of both Rpb8 and Rpb5 in the Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-affinity fraction was higher than others, consistent with the tight binding of Rpb1&#x02013;Rpb8 as previously observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd204c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd204c23">23</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Sub-assembly formation in the absence of Rpb3</title><p>To detect interactions among subunits other than Rpb3, we expressed 10 subunits excluding GST&#x02013;Rpb3 and isolated, by Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-affinity chromatography, subunit complexes containing Rpb1H. When the 11 subunits were coexpressed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd204f3">3</xref>B, lane 5), the same set of seven subunits as isolated by the GSH-affinity method were isolated by Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-affinity purification (lane 8). In agreement with the result of GSH-affinity assay, the level of Rpb2 recovery was lower than those of the other six. When Rpb1H expression was omitted (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd204f3">3</xref>B, lane 7), no subunit was recovered (lane 10), indicating that this system can be used for the isolation of subunit assemblies. In the absence of GST&#x02013;Rpb3 expression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd204f3">3</xref>B, lane 6), four subunits, Rpb2, Rpb5, Rpb7 and Rpb8, were recovered in the Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-affinity fractions at the same level as those in the presence of Rpb3, but the Rpb11 recovery was much reduced (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd204f3">3</xref>B, lane 9). This indicates that there are Rpb3-independent direct and&#x0002f;or indirect interactions among the five subunits, Rpb1, Rpb2, Rpb5, Rpb7 and Rpb8, and that Rpb3 is indispensable for the Rpb1&#x02013;Rpb11 connection.</p></sec><sec><title>Interactions among the four conserved subunits</title><p>Next we analyzed interactions among the four subunits, Rpb1H, Rpb2, GST&#x02013;Rpb3 and Rpb11, which correspond to the prokaryotic &#x003b2;&#x02032;, &#x003b2;, &#x003b1; and &#x003b1; subunit, respectively. When the four subunits were coexpressed, all the four subunits were copurified by GSH-affinity chromatography (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd204f4">4</xref>A and B, lanes 2 and 7), and when the three subunits, Rpb1H, Rpb2 and GST&#x02013;Rpb3, were coexpressed in the absence of Rpb11, the GSH-affinity fractions contained all the three subunits (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd204f4">4</xref>A and B, lanes 3 and 8). Furthermore, binary complexes, Rpb1H&#x02013;(GST&#x02013;Rpb3) and Rpb2&#x02013;(GST&#x02013;Rpb3), were recovered when the respective subunit pairs were coexpressed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd204f4">4</xref>A and B, lanes 4, 5, 9 and 10). This indicates that both Rpb1 and Rpb2 is able to bind to Rpb3 independently.</p></sec><sec><title>Interactions among the five small subunits</title><p>We also analyzed interactions among the five small subunits, GST&#x02013;Rpb3, Rpb5, Rpb7, Rpb8 and Rpb11, which were included in the assemblies isolated from the cells expressing all 11 subunits. When these five subunits were coexpressed, all of them were recovered in the assembly fraction after GSH-affinity chromatography (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd204f4">4</xref>C and D, lanes 13 and 23). In the control experiment expressing the GST in place of GST&#x02013;Rpb3, no subunit protein was recovered in the column bound fraction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd204f4">4</xref>C and D, lanes 12 and 22).</p><p>When one of the four subunits other than GST&#x02013;Rpb3 was omitted, all the expressed subunits were recovered together in the assembly fractions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd204f4">4</xref>C and D, lanes 14&#x02013;17 and 24&#x02013;27). In the absence of Rpb11 expression, however, the level of Rpb8 recovery in the assembly fraction was significantly reduced (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd204f4">4</xref>C and D, lane 24), though the expression level of Rpb8 was as high as those in other combinations of coexpression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd204f4">4</xref>C and D, lane 14). We also carried out pairwise expression of each small subunit with GST&#x02013;Rpb3 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd204f4">4</xref>C and D, lanes&#x000a0;18&#x02013;21). All the four subunits, Rpb5, Rpb7, Rpb8 and Rpb11, formed binary complexes with GST&#x02013;Rpb3 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd204f4">4</xref>C and D, lanes 28&#x02013;31). However, the level of (GST&#x02013;Rpb3)&#x02013;Rpb8 complex formation was less than other binary complexes (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd204f4">4</xref>C and D, lane 30). These observations indicate that the binding of Rpb8 to the Rpb3 is enhanced by association of Rpb11.</p><p>The recovery of Rpb5 in the assembly fraction was also reduced in the pairwise expression with GST&#x02013;Rpb3 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd204f4">4</xref>D, lane 28). Nevertheless, omission of any single subunit from the coexpression of five small subunits had virtually no effect on the high level recovery of Rpb5 in the assembly fractions (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd204f4">4</xref>D, lanes 24&#x02013;26). This implies that the Rpb3&#x02013;Rpb5 interaction can be supported by any one or two of the other three subunits. In the coexpression experiments of two or four sub-units, Rpb7 bound strongly to GST&#x02013;Rpb3 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd204f4">4</xref>D, lanes 24, 25, 27 and 29), but Rpb7 binding was reduced in the coexpression of five subunits (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd204f4">4</xref>D, lane 23). Coexistence of three other subunits restricted Rpb7 access to Rpb3.</p></sec><sec><title>Effect of Rpb8 on the Rpb1&#x02013;Rpb3 interaction</title><p>Rpb8 binds strongly to Rpb1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd204f3">3</xref>A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd204c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd204c24">24</xref>). Rpb8 also binds tightly to Rpb3 with the support of Rpb11 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd204f4">4</xref>D). To understand the relationship between these observations, we have examined the effect of Rpb8 on the Rpb1&#x02013;Rpb3 interaction. Rpb1H and GST&#x02013;Rpb3 were coexpressed in the presence or the absence of Rpb8 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd204f5">5</xref>, lanes 1 and 2). Rpb8 expression did not affect the expression levels of Rpb1H and GST&#x02013;Rpb3, with the difference &#x0003c;3&#x00025; as measured by the intensity of chemiluminescence in western blotting (data not shown). After GSH-affinity chromatography, Rpb1H from the cells coexpressing Rpb8 was recovered more than that without Rpb8 expression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd204f5">5</xref>, lanes 3 and 4). The Rpb1H&#x0002f;GST&#x02013;Rpb3 ratio between the assembly fractions with or without Rpb8 was reproducibly 1.3:1.0 in two independent experiments as measured by chemiluminescence (data not shown). This indicates the significant, albeit at low level, enhancement of the Rpb1&#x02013;Rpb3 interaction by Rpb8.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The formation of a multi-subunit sub-complex of <italic>S.pombe</italic> Pol II has been analyzed through the coexpression of 11 species of Pol II subunit in insect cells. Since the fusion of GST to the Rpb3 subunit does not prevent the assembly and the essential functions of Pol II in <italic>S.pombe</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd204f1">1</xref>), we expressed the GST&#x02013;Rpb3 fusion subunit for the isolation of subunit assemblies by GSH-affinity chromatography.</p><p>Using six different recombinant baculoviruses, all the 11 subunits were successfully expressed in the same cells. In the cells simultaneously expressing the 11 subunits, the six subunits, Rpb1H, Rpb2, Rpb5, Rpb7, Rpb8 and Rpb11, formed complexes with GST&#x02013;Rpb3 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd204f2">2</xref>). The coexpression of all the 11 subunits in the same cells was supported, because each of the unassembled subunits, Rpb6, Rpb9, Rpb10 and Rpb12, was expressed from the same viruses with the assembled subunits, Rpb5, Rpb7, Rpb2 and Rpb8, respectively. The assembly <italic>in vitro</italic> in cell extracts is unlikely, because Acker <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd204c29">29</xref>) observed that independently expressed human Pol II subunits did not form complexes after mixing the cell lysates.</p><p>Interactions between the <italic>S.pombe</italic> and the insect Pol II subunits may be possible because some Pol II subunits are highly conserved among organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd204c1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd204c7">7</xref>). However, western blot analysis indicated that the major contaminants in the assembly fractions were degradation products of the <italic>S.pombe</italic> small subunit, especially degraded GST&#x02013;Rpb3 which can bind to GSH&#x02013;Sepharose (data not shown). The possibility of hybrid Pol II formation may be excluded because: (i) the expression levels of <italic>S.pombe</italic> subunit proteins were higher than the endogenous Pol II &#x0005b;the level of even the least expressed subunit, Rpb1H, was 30&#x02013;50-fold higher than that of the cellular Rpb1 as revealed by western blotting using an anti-CTD antibody (data not shown)&#x0005d; and therefore the recombinant subunits must dominate in the assembly; (ii) the host cell gene expression is almost completely shut off at the late stage of infection when the subunit proteins are expressed from the polyhedrin and the p10 promoters; (iii) dissociation and reassociation of the cellular Pol II are improbable because the assembled Pol II enzyme is metabolically stable; (iv) the association of pre-existing unassembled cellular subunits must also be rare because the pool of unassembled subunits, if any, is small and must degrade rapidly after the virus infection.</p><p>None of the antisera used showed detectable cross-reaction with the cellular Pol II subunits in cell lysates (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd204f2">2</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd204f4">4</xref>C), but the possibility remains that cross-reactive signals are detected at high protein concentrations after the chromatography. However, this possibility could be ruled out, because the omission of each <italic>S.pombe</italic> subunit resulted in disappearance of the corresponding signal in the assembly fractions (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd204f2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd204f4">4</xref>). Thus, all the immunostained signals in the assembly fractions are attributable to the expressed <italic>S.pombe</italic> subunits.</p><p>Pairwise expression experiments indicated that each of the six assembled subunits binds directly to Rpb3 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd204f4">4</xref>). The other four subunits, Rpb6, Rpb9, Rpb10 and Rpb12, were expressed at high levels and extracted in the soluble fractions (data not shown) but failed to bind to GST&#x02013;Rpb3. This group of subunits might not interact directly with Rpb3, but be assembled into Pol II by binding to a subunit(s) other than Rpb3. In fact, we detected the interaction of the three subunits, Rpb6, Rpb10 and Rpb12, with both of the two large subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd204c23">23</xref>). In the chemical crosslinking experiments, we also observed the Rpb3&#x02013;Rpb10 interaction, but the major contact site of Rpb10 might be located on Rpb2. If the assembly of these four subunits depends on Rpb1&#x02013;Rpb2 complex formation, the level of those subunits in the assemblies might be lower than other subunits which bind directly to Rpb3, because only a small portion of the complexes contained the two large subunits.</p><p>In this study Rpb4 was not included because the <italic>rpb4</italic> cDNA was not available. We postulate that the absence of Rpb4 does not affect the assembly of other subunits, because a considerable portion of Pol II molecules in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> does not contain RPB4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd204c32">32</xref>). However, another possibility is that Rpb4 plays a role in the integration of four subunits, because recently we found that most of the <italic>S.pombe</italic> Pol II molecules contain Rpb4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd204c7">7</xref>). The failure of detection of the four subunits might also be due to: (i) fortuitous interaction with some cellular or viral components preventing the subunits from assembling; or (ii) some cellular components which are essential for the Pol II assembly are lost after the virus infection.</p><p>In this study we detected the Rpb3&#x02013;Rpb7 and Rpb3&#x02013;Rpb8 interactions, which had not been detected by chemical crosslinking or Far-western blotting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd204c23">23</xref>). The method employed in this work has advantages over previously reported <italic>in vitro</italic> methods, because: (i) the interaction of native proteins can be assayed <italic>in vivo</italic>; and (ii) the detection by chemical crosslinking depends on the nature of crosslinkers or the distance between specific amino acid side chains. The direct interaction of Rpb3 with as many as six subunits suggests that Rpb3 is one of the central subunits in the assembly, and thus it provides multiple contact surfaces for other subunits (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd204f6">6</xref>A), although multiple contacts among other subunits also play a role in the assembly (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd204f3">3</xref>B). This is reminiscent of the prokaryotic &#x003b1; subunit, the counterpart of Rpb3 and Rpb11, which provides contact surfaces for &#x003b1; dimerization and &#x003b2;&#x003b2;&#x02032; binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd204c33">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd204c36">36</xref>).</p><p>Since all the four small subunits, Rpb5, Rpb7, Rpb8 and Rpb11, were found to make direct contacts with both Rpb3 (this study) and one or both of the two large subunits, Rpb1 and Rpb2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd204c23">23</xref>), the multiple contacts among Pol II subunits must be important for the assembly of Pol II. In agreement with this idea, the assembly state of Pol II subunits is fortified concomitantly with the increase in the number of subunits for coexpression. For instance, the weak Rpb3&#x02013;Rpb8 interaction was reinforced by Rpb11, and the Rpb1&#x02013;Rpb3 interaction was done by Rpb8 though at a low level (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd204f6">6</xref>B). In addition, Rpb3 is essential for the efficient binding of Rpb11 to the complex, even though the Rpb1&#x02013;Rpb8&#x02013;Rpb11 interaction is possible (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd204f3">3</xref>B). A promotion of assembly of the largest subunit by Rpb8 agrees with the <italic>in vivo</italic> observation that overexpression of C160, the largest Pol III subunit in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic>, recruits the heterologously expressed <italic>S.pombe</italic> Rpb8 into the Pol III (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd204c37">37</xref>). In accordance with the stabilization of subunit complexes by multiple subunit&#x02013;subunit contacts, Rpb8 is efficiently assembled even in the absence of Rpb11 or Rpb3, if all other subunits are coexpressed (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd204f2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd204f3">3</xref>B). The Rpb3&#x02013;Rpb5 interaction was also intensified in the presence of the three subunits, Rpb7, Rpb8 and Rpb11 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd204f4">4</xref>C and D), suggesting the involvement of multiple contacts of Rpb3 and Rpb5 with other subunits for the stabilization of complex.</p><p>One exception to this rule is that the Rpb3&#x02013;Rpb7 interaction was slightly decreased when the other three small subunits were coexpressed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd204f4">4</xref>A and B). One explanation is that Rpb7 binding is restricted in the presence of a subset of subunits, but in the complete Pol II, this negative effect is neutralized or balanced by a full set of multiple contacts. The Rpb4-independent interaction of Rpb7 with Pol II has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd204c38">38</xref>) and here we propose that Rpb3 is the target for Rpb7 binding.</p><p>So far we failed to detect the enzymatic activity of RNA synthesis for the sub-assemblies formed in the insect cells (data not shown). Rpb1 and Rpb2 together form the active center of the enzyme, but only a small fraction of the sub-assemblies isolated in this study contained both of them, probably owing to the low expression levels. At present we reserve the conclusion whether the sub-assemblies are active in RNA synthesis or not. To reconstitute an active Pol II, the expression levels of the two large subunits must be improved.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkd204f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Isolation of Pol II from <italic>S.pombe</italic> carrying the GST&#x02013;<italic>rpb3</italic> fusion gene.

Solid lines indicate relatively strong bindings whereas dashed lines indicate interactions which are enhanced by multiple contacts.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkd20406"/></fig><table-wrap id="gkd204tb1"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title> Recombinant baculoviruses and donor plasmids</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" border="1" width="85%"><colgroup><col/><col/><col/><col/></colgroup><thead valign="bottom"><tr valign="top"><th valign="top">Virus</th><th valign="top">Plasmid</th><th valign="top">Promoter</th><th valign="top">&#x000a0;</th></tr><tr valign="top"><th valign="top">&#x000a0;</th><th valign="top">&#x000a0;</th><th valign="top">Polyhedrin</th><th valign="top">p10</th></tr></thead><tbody valign="top"><tr valign="top"><td valign="top">Bv1H<hr/></td><td valign="top">pFB-rpb1H<hr/></td><td valign="top"><italic>rpb1</italic>H<sub>10</sub><hr/></td><td valign="top">&#x000a0;<hr/></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td valign="top">Bv1&#x00394;C<hr/></td><td valign="top">pFB-rpb1&#x00394;C<hr/></td><td valign="top"><italic>rpb1</italic>&#x00394;C<hr/></td><td valign="top">&#x000a0;<hr/></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td valign="top">Bv2<hr/></td><td valign="top">pFB-rpb2<hr/></td><td valign="top"><italic>rpb2</italic><hr/></td><td valign="top">&#x000a0;<hr/></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td valign="top">BvG3<hr/></td><td valign="top">pFB-GSTrpb3<hr/></td><td valign="top">GST&#x02013;<italic>rpb3</italic><hr/></td><td valign="top">&#x000a0;<hr/></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td valign="top">Bv5<hr/></td><td valign="top">pFBD-rpb5<hr/></td><td valign="top"><italic>rpb5</italic><hr/></td><td valign="top">&#x02013;<hr/></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td valign="top">Bv6<hr/></td><td valign="top">pFBD-rpb6<hr/></td><td valign="top">&#x02013;<hr/></td><td valign="top"><italic>rpb6</italic><hr/></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td valign="top">Bv7<hr/></td><td valign="top">pFBD-rpb7<hr/></td><td valign="top"><italic>rpb7</italic><hr/></td><td valign="top">&#x02013;<hr/></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td valign="top">Bv8<hr/></td><td valign="top">pFBD-rpb8<hr/></td><td valign="top">&#x02013;<hr/></td><td valign="top"><italic>rpb8</italic><hr/></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td valign="top">Bv9<hr/></td><td valign="top">pFBD-rpb9<hr/></td><td valign="top"><italic>rpb9</italic><hr/></td><td valign="top">&#x02013;<hr/></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td valign="top">Bv10<hr/></td><td valign="top">pFBD-rpb10<hr/></td><td valign="top">&#x02013;<hr/></td><td valign="top"><italic>rpb10</italic><hr/></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td valign="top">Bv11<hr/></td><td valign="top">pFBD-rpb11<hr/></td><td valign="top">&#x02013;<hr/></td><td valign="top"><italic>rpb11</italic><hr/></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td valign="top">Bv12<hr/></td><td valign="top">pFBD-rpb12<hr/></td><td valign="top"><italic>rpb12</italic><hr/></td><td valign="top">&#x02013;<hr/></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td valign="top">Bv2&#x0002f;10<hr/></td><td valign="top">pFBD-rpb2&#x0002f;10<hr/></td><td valign="top"><italic>rpb2</italic><hr/></td><td valign="top"><italic>rpb10</italic><hr/></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td valign="top">BvG3&#x0002f;11<hr/></td><td valign="top">pFBD-GSTrpb3&#x0002f;11<hr/></td><td valign="top">GST&#x02013;<italic>rpb3</italic><hr/></td><td valign="top"><italic>rpb11</italic><hr/></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td valign="top">Bv5&#x0002f;6<hr/></td><td valign="top">pFBD-rpb5&#x0002f;6<hr/></td><td valign="top"><italic>rpb5</italic><hr/></td><td valign="top"><italic>rpb6</italic><hr/></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td valign="top">Bv7&#x0002f;9<hr/></td><td valign="top">pFBD-rpb7&#x0002f;9<hr/></td><td valign="top"><italic>rpb7</italic><hr/></td><td valign="top"><italic>rpb9</italic><hr/></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td valign="top">Bv12&#x0002f;8<hr/></td><td valign="top">pFBD-rpb12&#x0002f;8<hr/></td><td valign="top"><italic>rpb12</italic><hr/></td><td valign="top"><italic>rpb8</italic><hr/></td></tr><tr valign="top"><td valign="top">BvG&#x0002f;11</td><td valign="top">pFBD-GST&#x0002f;rpb11</td><td valign="top">GST</td><td valign="top"><italic>rpb11</italic></td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn><p>cDNAs inserted under each promoter are listed.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></sec><ack><sec><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We thank Ramesh Wigneshweraraj for critical reading of the manuscript.
