TFPI-2 readily inhibits trypsin, plasmin, chymotrypsin, cathepsin G, plasma kallikrein and the factor VIIa-tissue factor complex, but not urokinasetype plasminogen activator (uPA), tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) or thrombin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. It had already been reported that the expression of TFPI-2 was down regulated in several invasive tumor cell lines, including choriocarcinoma, glioma, prostate cancer, melanoma and fibrosarcoma, moreover ectopic expression of this gene inhibits tumors growth and metastasis in vivo by regulating pericellular ECM remodeling and angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Nevertheless, the mechanisms that alter/modify the expression of TFPI-2 gene in cancer cells are not well understood.</p><p>Cytosine hypermethylation at CpG dinucleotides in the promoter of tumor suppressor genes represents a major mechanism for gene inactivation in cancer. Methylation at 5' position of cytosine has been reported to alter or interfere with the correct binding of transcription factors to target sequences overlapping CpG dinucleotides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], and it also has a positive effect to recruit methyl-CpG binding activities that associate with histone deacetylases and other chromtin-modifying elements that lead to a transcriptionally silenced state. Many genes are hypermethylated at their CpG islands-containing promoters and subsequently inactivate in human tumors of different etiology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>TFPI-2 promoter exhibits typical features of a housekeeping gene with a high GC-rich content (approximately 75%). It has a typical GC box known as binding site for the transcription factor Sp1, and three transcription initiation sites (one major initiation site and the two minor initiation sites, but without canonical TATA and CAAT boxes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. It also has a potential Kruppel-like factor 6 (KLF6) binding site by bioinformatics. As transcription factors, KLF6 and Sp1 cooperatively transactivate the endoglin promoter of collagen alpha1(I), uPA, TGF-beta1, and TGF-beta receptor type 1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Direct physical interaction between Sp1 and KLF6 was documented by coimmunoprecipitation, pull-down experiments, and the GAL4 one-hybrid system, mapping the KLF6 interaction to the C-terminal domain of Sp1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>Breast cancer is the most common malignancy among females. Hypermethylation of promoter CpG islands, which is frequently observed in breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], is often associated with transcriptional silencing of the associated gene. In this paper, we explored both genetic and epigenetic mechanisms controlling TFPI-2 expression in human breast cancer cells and the results indicated that TFPI-2 expression could be silenced by promoter hypermethylation by inducing inactive chromatin structure and decreasing KLF6 binding to its DNA binding sequence.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Expression of TFPI-2 in breast cancer cells</title><p>Expression of TFPI-2 protein in human breast cancer cell lines with different metastasis potential was examined by western blotting.

After sequencing, several genetic variations were detected among breast cancer cell lines (p-1436MDA-MB-435: -1100 a to g, -1077 a to c, -1072 a to t, -1059 a to g, -876 t to o, -859 t to c, -811 a to g, +13 a to g; p-1436MDA-MB-231: -1222 a to g, -876 t to o, -463 c to t; p-1436MCF-7: -1196 g to c, -735 c to g, -702 c to t, -467 g to c; "o" represents deletion mutation), while the sequence from HUVEC was consistent with what Kamei S had reported (gene bank: AF217542) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].

The constructs of TFPI-2 promoter luciferase-reporter bearing respective genetic variations were transiently transfected into breast cancer cells and the luciferase activities were measured according to the manufacture's instruction. As shown in the Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref>, the luciferase activities of these constructs showed only slight difference and were not consistent with TFPI-2 expression pattern in these cell lines, indicating that the genetic variations located in the region from -460 to -1142 had no apparent effects on its promoter activities.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Analysis of TFPI-2 promoter</bold>.

The construct containing -667 to -1142 showed stronger luciferase activity, suggesting the activator/enhancer were presence between -667 to -1142. The transactivation effects were suppressed by the construct containing nucleotides -1142 to -1436, indicating that the repressor/silencer located in this region. In addition, the constructs -144 to -667 exhibited virtually the same luciferase activity as the -1436 construct, suggesting that nucleotides between -144 to +1 contain the sufficient promoter sequence for the expression of human TFPI-2 gene in breast cancer cell (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref>).

In addition, we used in vivo ChIP assays to demonstrate the effects of CpG methylation on KLF6 binding. KLF6 could bind to TFPI-2 promoter within the CpG islands in MCF-7 cells, for which the TFPI-2 promoter is unmethylated, but not in MDA-MB-435 cells, for which this promoter is methylated (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5b</xref>).

Methylation at the 5' position of cytosine has been reported to alter or interfere with the correct binding of transcription factors to target sequences overlapping CpG dinucleotides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], and it also recruit methyl-CpG binding activities that associate with histone deacetylases and other chromtin-modifying elements that lead to a transcriptionally silenced state.</p><p>KLF6, a candidate tumor suppressor gene in prostate cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], contains 283 aa and is present in many tissues, including placenta, heart, lung, liver and pancreas. As an activator of transcription, KLF6 interacts with the core promoter element of a TATA box-less gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] and cooperate with other transcription factors in Kruppel-like family, including SP1 and KLF4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. It had already been well documented that the promoter region of TFPI-2 has a high GC-rich content (approximately 75%), with the presence of typical GC boxes known as binding sites for the transcription factor Sp1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. After we found that there were no difference of KLF6 binding between MDA-MB-435 and MCF-7 cell (Fig <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3c</xref>), we considered that the cooperation of KLF6 and SP1 might be affected by abnormal hypermethylation in KLF6 binding site.</p><p>Treating the cell line MDA-MB-435 with Trichostatin A (TSA) which is a histone deacetylase inhibitor alone (from 100 to 300 ng/ml) could not reactivate expression of TFPI-2, but TSA could enhance the effects of methylase inhibitor AZA (data not shown). The TSA insensitive component of DNMT1 repression may be mediated by its interaction with DNMT associated protein (DMAP1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. These data indicated a cooperative model for histone deacetylation and DNA methylation in maintaining the silence of TFPI-2 in high invasive breast cancer cells. Another question needed to be addressed is why the SP1 binding site in TFPI-2 promoter remains unmethylated in high metastasis breast cancer cell. A possible proposal is that Sp1 elements protect a CpG island from de novo methylation, occurred in tumor genesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] and this needs to be further investigated.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In the present work, we shown that: 1) expression of TFPI-2 was repressed in highly invasive breast cancer cell lines; 2) the -84 ~ -36 region was critical for TFPI-2 promoter activity and a KLF6 binding site existed in this region which was abnormally hypermethylated in MDA-MB-435; 3) The CpG methylation in the binding site of KLF-6 blocked the binding of KLF6 to TFPI-2 promoter, diminished the trans-activation of KLF6 on the expression of TFPI-2 gene. On the basis of these findings, we conclude that the down regulation of TFPI-2 in highly metastasis breast cancer was due to the abnormal hypermethylation in CpG dinucleotides of KLF-6 binding site.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell cultures and drug treatment</title><p>Human breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-435, MDA-MB-231, T47D and MCF-7 were purchased from American Type Culture collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA), cultured in DMEM with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.
