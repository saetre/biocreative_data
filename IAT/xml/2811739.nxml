They are potent antigen presenting cells with the specific ability to stimulate na&#x000ef;ve T cells and control T cell responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008909-Banchereau1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. For their T cell priming capacity, DCs actively participate in development of autoimmune conditions. In particular, several reports support the importance of DCs during rheumatoid arthritis, a highly inflammatory disease characterized by proliferation of synovial tissue and associated joint destruction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008909-Walsh1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. It is generally agreed that the arthritic disease process involves abnormal presentation of self-antigens by antigen presenting cells, leading to activation of autoreactive T lymphocytes, that are a significant component of RA pathogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008909-Panayi1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Histological studies in patients showed that DCs cluster with T cells close to blood vessels, and presence of T cell infiltrates in the synovium are often observed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008909-Alvarez1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008909-Bousso1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008909-Leung1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, experimental animal studies have shown that DCs pulsed with collagen are able to induce autoimmune arthritis after transfer to joints <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008909-Leung1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, suggesting that DCs play an active role during the inductive phase of inflammation. For all these reasons, a lot of efforts have been spent in trying to elucidate the mechanisms controlling DC functions, as a way to target T cell responses.</p><p>DCs are activated in the periphery where they internalize and process the antigen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008909-Banchereau2">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008909-Boes1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. Next, DCs migrate to the lymph nodes where they present the antigen on MHC molecules, and the process culminates with activation of reactive T cells. DC migration is ensured by presence of podosomes, adhesive structures mediating short-lived and low-affinity interactions with the substrate. Podosomes are made by a core of actin bundles surrounded by a ring of vinculin and other actin regulatory proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008909-Linder1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. They are highly dynamic structures, fast assembled and disassembled to allow progression of the cell leading edge toward the migratory stimuli. Once DCs reach the lymph nodes, podosomes are replaced by long membrane extensions, called dendrites, which favor the interaction with potentially reactive T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008909-Bousso1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Dynamic changes in the actin cytoskeleton are controlled by the Rho family of small GTPases. In particular, Rac has been reported to be a critical player in cell motility in various cell types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008909-Wang1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008909-vanGolen1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008909-Minobe1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>.

In order to define the potential role of PLC&#x003b3;2 in the development of inflammatory arthritis we employed an established model of antigen-induced arthritis (AIA), in which WT and PLC&#x003b3;2&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice were immunized with methylated BSA (mBSA), followed by induction of acute local inflammatory response by a single knee injection of mBSA (or PBS as a negative control). Induction of arthritis in WT mice led to severe local joint inflammation, characterized by pronounced cellular infiltration and osteoclast recruitment with associated bone destruction compared to PBS control knees (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008909-g001">Figure 1A,B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008909-g002">2A,B</xref>). In contrast, PLC&#x003b3;2&#x02212;/&#x02212; animals showed no clinical signs of knee swelling, undetectable cellular infiltration or pannus formation in the joint space, and no osteoclast recruitment or bone erosion following the local injection of mBSA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008909-g001">Figure 1C,D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008909-g002">2A,B</xref>). The protection of PLC&#x003b3;2&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice from induction of arthritis was not due to absence of mature B cells, since PLC&#x003b3;2&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice adoptively transferred with WT B cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0008909.s001">Figure S1</xref>) were still resistant to development of the disease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008909-g001">Figure 1E,F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008909-g002">2A,B</xref>).

Although cell maturation occurs normally in the absence of PLC&#x003b3;2, the null cells appear larger, lack long membrane elongations that DCs form to interact with T cells, and present abnormal podosome structures, characterized by condensed actin dots not surrounded by the typical ring of vinculin. We have previously reported a role for PLC&#x003b3;2 in actin dynamics in osteoclasts. PLC&#x003b3;2&#x02212;/&#x02212; osteoclasts, like DCs, have abnormal actin cytoskeleton, as they lack the typical belt of actin which enables the cell to seal the acidic environment of the resorptive lacunae, allowing bone dissolution. As a consequence of aberrant resorption, PLC&#x003b3;2&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice have increased bone mass in basal condition and now we show are also protected from inflammatory-induced bone loss. Similarly to the osteoclasts, we find that DCs have an abnormal podosome structure. It is not clear how PLC&#x003b3;2 specifically modulates formation of podosomes, as focal contacts, more stable adhesive structures, form normally in PLC&#x003b3;2&#x02212;/&#x02212; DCs following short exposure to LPS stimulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0008909.s004">Figure S4</xref>).

Lack of these highly dynamic structures can affect the capacity of the cell to rapidly rearrange the actin cytoskeleton during cell migration or cell&#x02236;cell contacts.

Direct interaction between constitutively active Rac and the split pleckstrin domain of PLC&#x003b3;2 has been recently described in COS cell line <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008909-Walliser1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. Indeed, we find Rac to be activated in response to the chemokine CCL21 and regulated by PLC&#x003b3;2 in bone marrow derived DCs. Conversely, PLC&#x003b3;2 phosphorylation is normal in Rac1/2 deficient DCs. Thus, our data position PLC&#x003b3;2 as a critical modulator of Rac activity downstream of CCL21 receptor, CCR7. This data are further supported by the similar morphological, functional and signaling defects observed in both PLC&#x003b3;2&#x02212;/&#x02212; and Rac1/2&#x02212;/&#x02212; DCs.</p><p>DCs constitute a unique link between innate and adaptive immunity, and their targeting during inflammatory conditions may represent a valid alternative to current therapies which are often specific for only one component of the immune response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008909-Klareskog1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. Our in vivo animal studies unequivocally support the importance of PLC&#x003b3;2 in DCs during the development of an inflammatory response associated with antigen-induced arthritis. Moreover, previous studies showed that activation of PLC&#x003b3;2 in DCs occurs downstream of several immune receptors, in particular TLR4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008909-Aki1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref> and Dectin-1<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008909-Tassi1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008909-Xu2">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. Altogether, these data suggest that PLC&#x003b3;2 is actively regulated in DCs during the course of an inflammatory response.</p><p>We have previously reported that neutrophil activation is impaired in PLC&#x003b3;2&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008909-Cremasco1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Although we cannot exclude that neutrophils also participate in the development of inflammation in the antigen-induced model of arthritis, the finding that injection of antigen-pulsed PLC&#x003b3;2&#x02212;/&#x02212; DCs in WT mice is not sufficient to initiate the inflammatory disease, highlights the importance of DC motility and actin dynamics during DC-mediated activation of T cell responses. In agreement with this posture, injection of WT DCs in PLC&#x003b3;2&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice rescues inflammation, however bone resorption is still impaired. Focal osteolysis is a deleterious consequence of arthritic inflammatory conditions, reflected as bone pain, periarticular and appendicular osteopenia, and impaired mobility. Here we provide evidences that PLC&#x003b3;2 modulates bone loss independent from inflammation. While our prior investigation has revealed a role for PLC&#x003b3;2 in osteoclast formation and function under basal condition, now we prove that this holds true even in the context of an inflammatory condition known to be favorable for osteoclastic recruitment.</p><p>In summary, the importance of PLC&#x003b3;2 in osteoclasts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008909-Epple1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008909-Mao1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref> and neutrophils <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008909-Cremasco1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008909-Graham1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, in conjunction with its role in DC-mediated T cell activation here discussed, positions the molecule as a point of convergence between bone and immune systems in complex pathologies such as RA and other autoimmune diseases characterized by an interplay between bone and immune cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Mice</title><p>PLC&#x003b3;2&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice have been previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008909-Wang2">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>.
