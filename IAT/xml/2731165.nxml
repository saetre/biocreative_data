Conversely, knockdown of PALD gene expression resulted in increased IR abundance, enhanced insulin-stimulated AKT phosphorylation, and an improvement in insulin's ability to suppress FOXO1A-driven reporter gene activity.

Clinical and experimental data have demonstrated that T2D is highly correlated with the induction of insulin resistance. Finding negative modulators of insulin signaling is therefore of enormous scientific and therapeutic importance. Insulin activates two major signaling pathways, namely the phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI(3)K)-AKT and RAS-MAPK pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006871-White1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. While the RAS-MAPK pathway regulates cell growth, PI(3)K-AKT signaling is thought to be the key pathway by which insulin controls metabolic processes. Several insulin signaling inhibitors (e.g. PTP1B, PTEN, and IKK&#x003b2;) have already been found <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006871-Arkan1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006871-Stiles1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Given the complexity of insulin signaling, many more are likely to be discovered. For example, TRB3, a CDC25 binding protein homolog, has recently been reported to down-regulate hepatic AKT activation by insulin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006871-Du1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In the liver, insulin down regulates glucose production in part by repressing the transcription of the glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) gene via a well-documented PI(3)K-AKT-FOXO1A phosphorylation cascade <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006871-Schmoll1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Taking advantage of recent advances in functional profiling technology, we initiated a cDNA screen using the promoter of the G6Pase catalytic subunit driving luciferase expression as an insulin responsive reporter (G6Pase-Luc), with the objective of finding negative modulators of insulin signaling. In this report we describe the identification and initial functional characterization of novel cDNA inhibitors of insulin signaling, especially the potential regulatory role of the previously uncharacterized protein PALD on IR signaling.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><p>We hypothesized that forced expression of a negative modulator of insulin signaling would de-repress G6Pase-Luc reporter activity in the presence of insulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006871-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). The screen was optimized in readily transfectable Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO-K1) cells, which are responsive to insulin stimulation as demonstrated by the induction of AKT phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006871.s001">Figure S1A</xref>). In addition, CHO-K1 cells express an insignificant amount of FOXO1A transcription factor and G6Pase-Luc is inactive in these cells without exogenous expression of FOXO1A (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006871.s001">Figure S1B and C</xref>). Subsequently, co-transfection of FOXO1A with a genome-scale collection of 18,441 purported full length human cDNAs was performed, yielding 16,581 usable data points and 161 hits with reporter activities greater than two standard deviations above the mean (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006871-g001">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0006871-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0006871.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Genome-wide screen for negative modulators of insulin signaling.</title><p>(A) Scheme illustrating screen design. The G6Pase-Luc reporter is activated by FOXO1A transcription factor and cAMP treatment in the absence of insulin. Upon treatment of cells with insulin, a phosphorylation cascade is induced that leads to inactivation of FOXO1A and repression of G6Pase-Luc activity. In the presence of a cDNA-encoded inhibitor of insulin signaling however, G6Pase-Luc activity is restored. (B) Single-well luminescent signals of the 16,581 high-quality cDNA data set obtained from screening an arrayed library encoding 18,441 human transcripts. The luminescent signal is plotted on the y-axis as relative light units (RLU) with the corresponding well number on the x-axis. Representative hits are labeled in red and denoted as gene symbol plus transcript variant number, as applicable, and include: PTEN, PIK3R2, GRB10, PEA15, NCK2, ABR v1, SASH1, KIAA1274 (PALD), DUSP1, DUSP6 v1, DUSP7, DUSP10 v1, PTPRE v1, and PTPRR v2.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0006871.g001"/></fig><p>We chose 71 primary screen hits for detailed follow-up based on assay activity (i.e., generally favored those hits with highest primary screen activity, although several novel hits with lesser activities still above the two standard deviation cut-off were also included), novelty (i.e., included those hits for which little or no functional information has previously been reported), and predicted functions (i.e., included hits with predicted signal transduction functions such as kinases, phosphatases, and adaptors, while with a few exceptions excluding transcription factor-related hits since these would be predicted to have a higher &#x0201c;nonspecific&#x0201d; hit rate in our screen). First, to determine whether activation of the reporter by the hits was specifically due to inhibition of insulin signaling, we repeated the G6Pase-Luc reporter assay with and without insulin and normalized the reporter activity in the presence of insulin to that in the absence of insulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006871-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). The resulting ratio is directly correlated with the extent of insulin inhibition. For example, whereas overexpression of a negative control &#x003b1;-tubulin (K-&#x003b1;-1) resulted in a minimal ratio of 0.15 (luciferase activity in the presence of insulin is 15&#x00025; of that in the absence of insulin), expression of PTEN and GRB10, both known inhibitors of insulin signaling, yielded more than two-fold higher inhibition ratios of 0.35 and 0.7 respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006871-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Statistically, of the 71 cDNAs examined, 46 significantly overcame insulin's repression of G6Pase promoter activity compared to the negative control, K-&#x003b1;-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006871-g002">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006871.s003">Table S1</xref>). Importantly, dual specificity phosphatase (DUSP) family members identified in the original screen (DUSP1, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 10) were positive in the insulin-dependency test, while other DUSP family members (DUSP2, 3, &#x00026; 14) were negative in both the primary and initial secondary screening, indicating specificity among DUSP family members in their effects on insulin signaling and excluding generalized phosphatase overexpression as a source of experimental artifacts.</p><fig id="pone-0006871-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0006871.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Characterization of hits from the primary screen.</title><p>(A) Inhibition of insulin's repression of the G6Pase-Luc reporter. Seventy-one selected hits were retested in the primary assay in the presence and absence of insulin. Inhibition of insulin response was defined as the ratio of luciferase activity in the presence of insulin to that in the absence of insulin, which is positively correlated with the extent of inhibition of the insulin signal. The cDNAs were filtered based on their ability to significantly (p&#x0003c;0.05) inhibit insulin signaling in an insulin-dependent manner relative to the negative control, &#x003b1;-tubulin (K-&#x003b1;-1). (B) Inhibition of insulin effect on IRE-4U reporter. The 46 cDNAs demonstrated to inhibit insulin signaling were assayed with a FOXO1A-dependent promoter (IRE-4U). Similar to (A) above, the IRE-4U luciferase activity in the presence of insulin was divided by that in the absence of insulin. This ratio is positively correlated with the extent of inhibition of FOXO1A-dependent transcription by insulin.

As observed with the G6Pase-Luc reporter assay, PTEN (0.60) and GRB10 (0.99) exhibited at least two-fold greater insulin inhibition ratios than the K-&#x003b1;-1 control (0.26) in the context of the IRE-4U reporter assay. 34 of the 46 insulin-dependent cDNAs also significantly inhibited insulin signaling on the FOXO1A-dependent reporter as compared to K-&#x003b1;-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006871-g002">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006871.s004">Table S2</xref>) indicating that they act at or upstream of FOXO1A.</p><p>Since insulin regulates FOXO1A transcriptional activity predominately through AKT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006871-Barthel1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, the effect of overexpression of screen hits on insulin-induced AKT phosphorylation was investigated at six time points over a 24 hour period using a high throughput multiplex immunoassay that detects total AKT and phosphoAKT (S473) proteins simultaneously.

These results, obtained in multiple cellular contexts using both reporter activation and AKT phosphorylation status, strongly suggest a role for PALD in insulin-induced AKT phosphorylation.</p><p>Because overexpression of PALD resulted in the inhibition of both S473 and T308 phosphorylation on AKT, we hypothesized that PALD could be targeting an upstream component in the insulin signaling pathway, including the insulin receptor (IR). We stripped the membrane used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006871-g004">Figure 4A</xref> and re-probed with an anti-insulin receptor &#x003b2; subunit antibody and a phosphotyrosine-specific antibody targeting Y1162/Y1163 of IR. Forced expression of PALD yielded a reduction of phosphorylated Y1162/Y1163 that correlated with a decreased overall abundance of the mature IR &#x003b2; subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006871-g004">Figure 4D</xref>), with both bands exhibiting a faster migration on the gel. These observations are unlikely due to inconsistent loading, since the level of total AKT is fairly constant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006871-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). Moreover, PALD-mediated down regulation of IR was likely not simply an artifact of overexpression since PALD depletion by siRNA enhanced IR abundance and Y1162/Y1163 phosphorylation levels with a corresponding augmentation in insulin-induced AKT activation (i.e., T308 phosphorylation, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006871-g004">Figure 4E</xref>). Together these results implicate a role for PALD as a negative regulator of insulin signaling.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>In the present study, we successfully integrated an arrayed cDNA functional profiling platform with an insulin responsive reporter that targeted the FOXO1A pathway to search for novel negative modulators of insulin signaling.

As such, relatively little is known about its function. The cDNA encodes a protein of 856 amino acids with two phosphatase signature motifs (CXXGXGR) and an N-terminal myristoylation site. The regions containing the phosphatase signature motifs are related to one another, but are only distantly related to the protein tyrosine phosphatase family <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006871-Alonso1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>.

It is therefore tempting to speculate that PALD influences insulin signaling by dephosphorylating IR upon insulin-mediated autophosphorylation, leading to IR turnover. To date, however, we have been unable to detect phosphatase activity with full-length or truncated expression forms of PALD (data not shown) and so the precise mechanism by which PALD modulates IR abundance remains to be determined. Nevertheless, to our knowledge, this is the first functional characterization of PALD in insulin signaling or any other pathway. <italic>Pald</italic> mouse knockouts, which are being generated, should further clarify PALD's role and necessity in mediating insulin signaling.</p><p>Other primary screen hits represent a diverse array of biochemical functions and include many known inhibitors of insulin signaling, such as phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), which has been shown to negatively modulate insulin signaling by both gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006871-KurlawallaMartinez1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006871-Stiles1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, PI(3)K p85 &#x003b2; subunit (PIK3R2), whose concentration is critical in regulating PI(3)K activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006871-Brachmann1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006871-Ueki1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, and phosphoprotein enriched in astrocytes 15 (PEA15), which is up-regulated in type 2 diabetes and whose transgenic expression causes diabetes by affecting both insulin sensitivity and insulin secretion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006871-Condorelli1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006871-Vigliotta1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. The identification of these well-characterized insulin signaling modulators as well as a number of additional hits previously linked to this pathway not only served as effective internal positive controls but also support the premise of our primary screening approach.</p><p>Whereas the primary assay merely identified known and novel inhibitors of insulin signaling, we applied a series of secondary assays in order to shed further light on the role such inhibitors may play. NCK2 for example, was previously implicated in insulin signaling due to its interaction with insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006871-Tu1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. Here we found that NCK2 inhibits insulin signaling and does so by repressing insulin-induced AKT phosphorylation. DOK2 has also been implicated in insulin signaling by virtue of its similarity to IRS family members <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006871-Cai1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>; we now provide functional evidence for a role for DOK2 as an inhibitor of insulin action.</p><p>Members of two distinct phosphatase families, the receptor type protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTPR) family (e.g. PTPRE and PTPRA) and the dual specificity phosphatase (DUSP) family (e.g. DUSP1, 4, 6, 7, and 10, these are also known as MAP kinase phosphatases, MKPs), were prominent among our hits and certain family members have previously been implicated in insulin signaling. Notably, in addition to DUSP6 (MKP3) and DUSP7 (MKPX), which were previously shown to overcome insulin's repression of the PEPCK promoter via an unknown mechanism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006871-Xu1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006871-Xu2">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, we identified DUSP1 (MKP1), DUSP4 (MKP2), and DUSP10 (MKP5) as potential inhibitors of insulin signaling. We also further demonstrated that some of these phosphatases (DUSP 1, 4, 7, 10, PTPRE v2, and PTPRR v2) affect insulin-regulated FOXO1A activity without inhibiting AKT phosphorylation. The fact that several of the DUSPs inhibited insulin regulated FOXO1A activity independent of AKT phosphorylation at S473 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006871-g002">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006871-g003">3A</xref>) indicates that the MAPK pathway plays a role in regulating FOXO1A activity. Such a role has recently been demonstrated for ERK and p38MAPK, which phosphorylate FOXO1 at sites distinct from those phosphorylated by AKT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006871-Asada1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. Phosphorylation of FOXO1 at the ERK sites promotes its interaction with the transcription factor ETS and potentiates ETS's ability to activate transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006871-Asada1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In addition to PALD, a number of the confirmed screen hits have not previously been implicated in insulin signaling and are therefore putative novel inhibitors of insulin signaling. For example, active BCR related gene (ABR), a GTPase associated protein that exhibits intrinsic GAP and GEF activities, was previously demonstrated to participate in postnatal cerebellar development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006871-Kaartinen1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. ABR overexpression potently inhibited insulin's effect on FOXO1A-mediated transcription and AKT phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006871-g002">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006871-g003">3A</xref>). Although sharing 68&#x00025; amino acid sequence identity to ABR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006871-Tan1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006871-Chuang1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, BCR overexpression had only a minor inhibitory effect on insulin-induced AKT phosphorylation (data not shown). It has recently been reported that both BCR and ABR are GAPs for Rac and loss of either ABR or BCR leads to abnormal macrophage morphology and motility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006871-Cho1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. Consistently, we find that overexpression of exogenous ABR leads to cells with fewer protrusions (data not shown) and this many explain in part its effects on insulin signaling.</p><p>Another noteworthy hit not previously linked to insulin signaling was the adaptor SAM and SH3 domain containing 1 (SASH1). Recent work has led to the prediction that SASH1 may function as a tumor suppressor and play a significant role in breast cancer and lung cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006871-Zeller1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. Our studies showed that SASH1 can also significantly inhibit insulin's ability to repress FOXO1A-mediated transcription by inhibiting insulin-induced AKT phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006871-g002">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006871-g003">3A</xref>). Since insulin signaling via the PI(3)K-AKT pathway also plays a role in cell proliferation, our results may have pinpointed the mechanism by which SASH1 regulates cell proliferation.</p><p>Although the overall biological significance of our screen results will require further studies for each individual hit, the combination of different pathway assays we employed for initial follow-up has already provided significant preliminary validation and revealed interesting mechanistic leads for many of the screen hits. In conclusion, the present data strongly illustrate the applicability of arrayed genome-wide screening technologies to identifying novel modulators of insulin signaling.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Materials</title><p>Anti-phospho-insulin receptor (Tyr 1162/1163) antibody was purchased from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA).
