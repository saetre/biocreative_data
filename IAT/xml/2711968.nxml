The mammalian Prx family has six distinct members (Prx I-VI) in various subcellular locations, including peroxisomes and mitochondria, places where oxidative stress is most evident. The function of Prx I in particular has been implicated in regulating cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Since thioredoxin1 (Trx1) as an electron donor is functionally associated with Prx I, we investigated levels of expression of both Prx I and Trx1.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>We investigated levels of expression of both Prx I and Trx1 in breast cancer by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Levels of messenger RNA (mRNA) for both Prx I and Trx1 in normal human breast tissue were very low compared to other major human tissues, whereas their levels in breast cancer exceeded that in other solid cancers (colon, kidney, liver, lung, ovary, prostate, and thyroid). Among members of the Prx family (Prx I-VI) and Trx family (Trx1, Trx2), Prx I and Trx1 were preferentially induced in breast cancer. Moreover, the expression of each was associated with progress of breast cancer and correlated with each other. Western blot analysis of different and paired breast tissues revealed consistent and preferential expression of Prx I and Trx1 protein in breast cancer tissue.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Prx I and Trx1 are overexpressed in human breast carcinoma and the expression levels are associated with tumor grade.

It has been demonstrated <italic>in vitro </italic>that ROS in small amounts participate in many physiological processes such as signal transduction, cell differentiation, apoptosis, and modulation of transcription factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. All organisms, from prokaryotes to primates, are equipped with different defensive systems to combat the toxic processes of ROS. These defensive systems include antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutases, catalases, glutathione peroxidases, and a new type of peroxidase, the rapidly growing family of peroxiredoxins (Prxs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>The major functions of Prxs comprise cellular protection against oxidative stress, modulation of intracellular signaling through H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>as a second messenger molecule, and regulation of cell proliferation. Peroxiredoxins are capable of protecting cells from ROS toxicity and regulating signal transduction pathways that use c-Abl, caspases, nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-&#x003ba;B), and activator protein-1 to influence cell growth and apoptosis. Evidence is fast growing that oxidative stress is important not only for normal cell physiology but also for many pathological processes such as atherosclerosis, neurodegenerative diseases, and cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Reactive oxygen species participate in carcinogenesis in all stages, including initiation, promotion, and progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] Levels of ROS such as O<sub>2</sub><sup>- </sup>are increased in breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The production of ROS accelerates tumor induction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In vitro, Prx genes I-IV are overexpressed when H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>concentration in cells is elevated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>Peroxiredoxin I, a cytosol form, is the most abundant and ubiquitously distributed member of the mammalian Prx family, and it has been identified in a large variety of organisms. It has been suggested that Prx I regulates cell proliferation and apoptosis by its interaction with oncogene products such as c-Abl. Peroxiredoxin I has been investigated in various human cancer samples as a potential marker. The reports cited above support that Prx I may be closely associated with cancers. Nevertheless, the connection between Prx I and cancer has not yet been clearly defined. Elevated expressions of Prx I have been observed in several human cancers, including lung, breast, esophagus, oral, and thyroid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. In oral squamous cell cancer, Yanagawa <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] found low levels of Prx I expression associated with larger tumor masses, lymph node metastases, and poorly differentiated cancers. In contrast, Karihtala <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] found no correlation between Prx I expression and clinicopathological features in breast cancer. Instead, levels of expression of Prxs III, IV, and V were significantly higher when breast cancers were poorly differentiated, suggesting their relationship to breast cancer.</p><p>There are two major Prx subfamilies. One subfamily uses two conserved cysteines (2-Cys), and the other uses one cysteine (1-Cys) to scavenge H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2 </sub>and alkyl hydroperoxides. Four mammalian 2-Cys members (Prx I-IV) use thioredoxin (Trx) as the electron donor for antioxidation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Thioredoxin as an antioxidant protein is induced by various kinds of oxidative stresses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Similar to Prxs, Trx plays an important role in regulating cancer cell growth, for example, by modulating the DNA binding activity of transcription factors, including nuclear factor-&#x003ba;B, p53, and glucocorticoid and estrogen receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Thioredoxin may be closely associated with cancers. Immunohistochemical analysis using anti-Trx antibody has shown the expression of Trx in a number of human cancer tissues, including liver, colon, pancreas, and uterine cervix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. These data indicate the possible involvement of Trx in the process of oncogenesis.</p><p>To investigate the significance of Prx I in breast cancers, we examined Prx I expression in 204 samples of breast cancer tissue, as a model tissue, using quantitative methods such as real time-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot, and we investigated association with cancer grade. Since Trx1 is functionally associated with Prx I as the electron donor, we also examined the expression of Trx in the same tissues. The association of Trx1 with Prx I may indicate a physiological role for Prx I in breast cancer.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study Material for Real-Time PCR Analysis</title><p>We used Human Major 48 Tissues real-time (HMRT) quantitative PCR arrays, Cancer Survey real-time (CSRT 96-I) quantitative PCR arrays, and Human Breast Cancer real-time (BCRT I-V) qPCR arrays from OriGene (OriGene Technologies, Inc, Rockville, MD, USA). Simultaneous examination of the expression of target genes in 48 different tissues was performed using the HMRT array, which consisted of panels of first-strand complementary DNA (cDNA) from human tissues selected from individuals of different ethnicity. Expression levels of target genes in eight different cancers (breast, colon, kidney, liver, lung, ovary, prostate, and thyroid) were measured using the CSRT array, consisting of 12 samples from each cancer type with cancer stage from I to IV. Expression of target genes in breast cancer was examined using four different sets of arrays (BCRT I-IV) to test 192 samples and using the CSRT 96-I array to test 12 samples. In the 204 samples, grading was distributed as follows: stage 0 (normal), 19; stage I, 37; stage II, 76; stage III, 60; and stage IV, 12. The cancer tissue types consisted of ductal (<italic>n </italic>= 154), lobular (<italic>n </italic>= 13), metastatic (<italic>n </italic>= 12), and other histological types of cancer (<italic>n </italic>= 25), including medullary, mucinous, tubular, recurrent, and papillary. More clinicopathological information for each patient is described in OriGene's product sheet.

Anti-Prx I, anti-Prx II, anti-Trx1, and anti-copper/zinc (Cu/Zn) superoxide dismutase (SOD) rabbit polyclonal antibodies that have cross-reactivity with the corresponding human protein were purchased from AbFrontier (Seoul, Korea). Samples were fractionated by electrophoresis on a 4% to 20% gradient sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) polyacrylamide gel (PAGE) (GenScript Corp, Piscataway, NJ, USA) and transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes (Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). The membranes were blocked and incubated with antibody (1:1000 by volume) in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.1% Tween 20 at room temperature for 2 hours. After extensive washing, the membranes were incubated with polyclonal goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (1:2000 by volume) conjugated with horseradish peroxidase.

Polymerase chain reaction was performed in 96-well optical plates using the iCycler (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) with primers specific for Prx I-VI, Trx1, Trx2, &#x003b2;-actin, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), and iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad). The resulting fluorescence proportional to the amount of amplified DNA was measured at the end of each elongation phase at 530 nm. A standard graph of C<sub>T </sub>(the point at which the fluorescence crosses the threshold) values obtained from serially diluted target genes was constructed for all reactions to ensure that they were amplified and reported in proportion to template. C<sub>T </sub>values were converted to gene copy number of the template cDNA using the equation 2<sup>&#x00394;&#x00394;CT</sup>. The &#x00394;C<sub>T </sub>is the abundance of cDNAs for transcripts of each gene normalized to the &#x003b2;-actin and GAPDH at each time point. The &#x00394;&#x00394;C<sub>T </sub>is obtained by subtracting a calibrator value for each gene transcript being assayed. In parallel with each cDNA sample, standard curves were generated to correlate C<sub>T </sub>values using serial dilutions of the target gene. The quality of the standard curve was judged from the slope and the correlation coefficient.

Overexpression of Prx I was detected in 21 of 24 patients (87.5%) with breast cancer, but no significant relationship was found between overexpression of Prx I and progress in breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Their finding of overexpression of Prx I protein in breast cancer tissue by Western immunoblotting agrees with our observations (7 of 8 cases, 87.5%; 0 of 6 normal, 0%). One study has examined the association of overexpression of Prx I protein with clinicopathological parameters in oral cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Low Prx I expression in oral cancer was associated with larger tumor mass and poorly differentiated cancer cells. In our study, all samples of breast cancer stage IV, which belonged to metastatic breast cancers, were found to overexpress Prx I at the highest level. Moreover, in our study of 204 samples, Prx I expression was significantly associated with increasing cancer progress.</p><p>We examined all six members of the Prx family in eight human cancers (breast, colon, kidney, liver, lung, ovary, prostate, and thyroid) and found that Prx I was preferentially induced only in breast cancer, not in other cancer tissues. The isoforms Prx I and II were highly expressed in breast cancer. The expression level of Prx II was slightly higher than that of Prx I in breast cancer, but the induction fold of Prx I was significantly higher than that of Prx II. This apparent inconsistency seems to be caused by the lower level of Prx I mRNA in normal breast tissue compared with that of Prx II.</p><p>At present, few studies have been conducted on all six Prx members in various human cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In contrast to our observations, other results have shown high protein expression of Prxs III, IV, and V in breast cancer, but not Prxs I, II, V, and VI. Immunoreactive protein and mRNA levels do not necessarily correspond with each other, as previously seen in a study of Prx V in rat tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. This suggests that both translational and posttranslational mechanisms probably have effects on Prx protein expression in human tissues. For example, destabilizing Prx proteins by overoxidation or phosphorylation leads to degradation, which results in reduced protein levels in cancer tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Such posttranslational modification in cancer tissue could be one of the reasons for the discrepancy between mRNA and protein levels of Prx I in breast tissue. A more reliable approach may be to assess the level of transcription in cancer samples. In our study, we attempted to measure transcription.</p><p>As an electron donor, Trx is essential to cellular function of Prx [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Of the two isoforms of human Trx, cytoplasmic Trx1 and mitochondrial Trx2, we focused on Trx1 in breast cancer tissue because of its localization with Prx I. As with Prx I, there are many reports that Trx1 may be closely associated with cancers. Previous studies have shown the expression of Trx1 in a number of human cancer tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Estrogen receptors and p53 are important transcription factors in the growth regulation of cancer cells in breast cancer. Previous findings suggest that Trx1 expression is linked to the estrogen receptor-dependent and p53-dependent regulation of growth in breast cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. This observation is consistent with the association of Trx1 and breast cancer. In the present study, we demonstrated that increasing Trx1 expression was associated with progress of breast cancer, and that Trx1 was correlated with Prx I in human breast cancer. It is not certain that, in breast cancer, the involvement of Trx1 reflects its ability to regulate Prx I action, but at least in terms of magnitude of expression in the same patients, the association of Trx1 with Prx1 supports the theory that their functions are related to each other in breast cancer.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have demonstrated here that Prx I and Trx1 are preferentially overexpressed in human breast carcinoma and the expression levels are associated with tumor grade. In addition, Prx I expression is correlated with Trx1 expression in breast cancer. We found that mRNA levels for both Prx I and Trx1 in normal breast tissue are extremely low compared with those of other major human tissues. Based on these observations, we suggest that Prx I and Trx1 could be used as potential breast cancer markers.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>ROS: reactive oxygen species; Prx: peroxiredoxin; Trx: thioredoxin; DTT: dithiothreitol; SDS: sodium dodecyl sulfate; PAGE: polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; PCR: Polymerase chain reaction.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>IHK conducted the work, analyzed the data and wrote the manuscript.
