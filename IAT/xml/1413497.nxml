Light may affect such overt rhythms in two ways: (1) by entraining the clock circuits and (2) via clock-independent molecular pathways. In this study we examine the relationship between autonomous transcript oscillations and light-driven transcript responses. Transcript profiles of wild-type and arrhythmic mutant <italic>Drosophila</italic> were recorded both in the presence of an environmental photocycle and in constant darkness. Systematic autonomous oscillations in the 12- to 48-h period range were detectable only in wild-type flies and occurred preferentially at the circadian period length. However, an extensive program of light-driven expression was confirmed in arrhythmic mutant flies. Many light-responsive transcripts are preferentially expressed in the compound eyes and the phospholipase C component of phototransduction, NORPA (no receptor potential), is required for their light-dependent regulation. Although there is evidence for the existence of multiple molecular clock circuits in cyanobacteria, protists, plants, and fungi, <italic>Drosophila</italic> appears to possess only one such system. The sustained photic expression responses identified here are partially coupled to the circadian clock and may reflect a mechanism for flies to modulate functions such as visual sensitivity and synaptic transmission in response to seasonal changes in photoperiod.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="synopsis"><title>Synopsis</title><p>Daily changes in sunlight dramatically affect the environment of animals like the fruit fly, a genetic model. To anticipate these changes, the fruit fly possesses a circadian molecular clock that regulates its behavioral activity and other physiology according to the time of day. The clock's mechanism is comprised of genes and their products (proteins and RNAs). One way the clock modulates physiology is by regulating other genes' RNAs. The signature of a circadian RNA is that its levels oscillate once each day. The present study uses microarrays and a novel statistical strategy to resolve how many genes are oscillating in the fly head and verify that there is only a single transcriptional clock. However, this study also finds a large number of genes that are directly regulated by the presence of light. These genes respond to light even in the absence of a functioning clock. Indeed, the light response depends on a signaling component in the retina that has an established role in vision. This represents a new mechanism by which an animal's physiology may be dynamically tuned to daily time.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="18"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>Citation:</meta-name><meta-value>Wijnen H, Naef F, Boothroyd C, Claridge-Chang A, Young MW (2006) Control of daily transcript oscillations in <italic>Drosophila</italic> by light and the circadian clock.

Circadian clocks regulate the timing of diverse behavioral and physiological functions, and many of the molecular components of such clocks have been identified by genetic and biochemical studies. Feedback circuits regulated at the level of clock gene expression, clock protein accumulation, and clock protein degradation are thought to form most if not all circadian clocks. Interactions among these circuits appear to promote molecular oscillations of the clock components themselves and rhythmic gene activities that are subordinate to the clock. Entrainment of circadian clocks to environmental cycles of light and dark is best understood in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>Neurospora</italic>. In the former, the clock protein TIM (timeless) is rapidly degraded in response to light, causing resetting of the oscillating mechanism. In <italic>Neurospora,</italic> light induces expression of the clock gene <italic>frequency,</italic> which encodes the central transcriptional repressor in the <italic>Neurospora</italic> clockworks (for reviews, see &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020039-b001">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020039-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;).</p><p>While current knowledge of the molecular clock circuits can account for the autonomous oscillator function and photic entrainment of the circadian clock, many questions regarding the connections between molecular oscillations and overt rhythms remain unanswered. For example, rhythmic synaptic release of the neuropeptide PDF (pigment dispersing factor) from a subset of pacemaker neurons in the adult brain is required for maintenance of circadian locomotor behavior under constant conditions &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020039-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d; and for the increased locomotor activity that occurs in anticipation of dawn in the presence of an environmental photocycle &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020039-b011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020039-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;, but it is unclear how PDF release is governed by the molecular clock circuits. One of the most obvious mechanisms for generating molecular output from the circadian clock is the induction of rhythmic transcription of output genes that do not feed back on the clock circuits, but instead contribute directly or indirectly to the generation of overt rhythms. The fact that functional clock circuits are widespread throughout the bodies of animals (for review, see &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020039-b013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020039-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d;) suggests that tissue-specific physiological rhythms may be specified by locally generated circadian transcriptional profiles. To test the hypothesis that signals from both the pacemaker neurons and peripheral clock tissues may be initiated at the level of clock-controlled gene expression, we and others have conducted genome-wide surveys to characterize the extent and nature of rhythmic transcription in the fly head &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020039-b015">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020039-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;. Along with similar studies in <italic>Arabidopsis,</italic> mouse, rat, and <italic>Neurospora</italic> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020039-b020">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020039-b027">27</xref>&#x0005d;, these studies established the idea that transcriptional modulation of mRNA levels is a widely used mechanism of clock output.</p><p>One surprising result from these studies was the poor overlap between the proposed circadian gene lists of the five different fly circadian microarray studies &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020039-b015">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020039-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;. Despite the fact that a number of predicted circadian transcript oscillations were validated independently by Northern blot analysis or real-time PCR &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020039-b015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020039-b016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020039-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;, this between-study discrepancy raised serious concerns regarding the true extent of the intrinsic clock-dependent expression program. To address this controversy, we developed a new analytical strategy that allowed us to measure intrinsic rhythmicity in time-series microarray data. When applied to wild-type data, this method revealed wide-spread 24-h rhythmicity in gene expression levels. A meta-analysis of all available data clearly resolved that circadian modulation affects many more mRNAs in the fly head than is indicated by the overlap of published transcript profiling studies.</p><p>Our new analytical approach also allowed us to address three other questions that are central to animal circadian biology: (1) the importance of ultradian or infradian periodicity in gene expression, (2) the existence of alternative circadian oscillators, and (3) the relationship between diurnal and circadian regulation of gene expression.</p><p>First, is a significant part of the transcriptome regulated by ultradian or infradian rhythms in the 12- to 48-h range? In wild-type data 24-h rhythms were selectively enriched in comparison to ultradian or infradian periods. Moreover, unlike circadian rhythms, expression rhythms at non-circadian period lengths such as 12 or 16 h were no more prevalent in real wild-type or mutant data than in randomly permuted data.</p><p>Second, is the known clock, which controls behavior and requires <italic>tim</italic> the only transcriptional clock in <italic>Drosophila?</italic> No preference for circadian rhythmicity was found in <italic>tim</italic> null-mutant <italic>(tim<sup>01</sup>)</italic> data, a result consistent with the hypothesis that this mutant lacks a functional circadian clock &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020039-b028">28</xref>&#x0005d;. Absence of 24-h rhythmicity in <italic>tim<sup>01</sup></italic> adult heads was further supported by a systematic appraisal of candidate gene profiles by Northern blotting. In addition to this loss of circadian gene activity, our studies failed to detect gene expression rhythms with alternative periods in the range of 12 to 48 h in <italic>tim<sup>01</sup></italic> flies, indicating that there are no residual transcriptional clocks in these mutants. Our results strongly suggest that the extensive program of rhythmic control detected in wild-type flies reflects function of a single circadian molecular oscillator.</p><p>Third, we address the issue of how light affects daily transcript oscillations in the fly head. Does it do so solely through its effect on the clock, or are there other pathways of daily gene regulation? If there are other pathways, how do they interact with the clock-controlled modulation? Stratification of the data into entrainment and free-running days allowed us to search for mRNA expression profiles that vary periodically as a function of an imposed photocycle in both wild-type and <italic>tim<sup>01</sup></italic> flies. Our method uncovered a set of transcripts that show sustained up- or down-regulation in response to light. These light responses are abrogated in flies mutant for the <italic>norpA</italic> (no receptor potential A) gene, which have a defect in visual transduction &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020039-b029">29</xref>&#x0005d;, but persist in the <italic>cry<sup>b</sup></italic> (cryptochrome-baby mutant), which has a specific defect in light-responsiveness of the clock &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020039-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d;. Independently selected groups of light-regulated and clock-regulated transcripts were found to overlap significantly. On the basis of the associated gene functions and spatial expression patterns, we believe the newly identified light-driven expression system is likely linked to control of vision and synaptic function.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Systematic Enrichment for Circadian Transcript Regulation in Wild-Type Adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> Heads</title><p>To identify high-confidence rhythmic gene expression, we compared the distribution of oscillatory statistics in wild-type microarray data with a permutation null-model as outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020039-g001">Figure 1</xref>. In such models the original time ordering is randomly scrambled to construct the distribution of scores expected for arrhythmic data. The results are illustrated by the quantile&#x02013;quantile (QQ) plots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020039-g002">Figure 2</xref>A. In the QQ plots, the Fourier scores of real data (on the <italic>y</italic>-axis) are graphed against quantile Fourier scores associated with our null hypothesis (on the <italic>x</italic>-axis). Enrichment of a test period in the real data is detected as an upward departure from the diagonal. From the QQ plots for 12-, 16-, 24-, and 48-h periods, it is clear that wild-type flies show a dramatic increase in transcript oscillations only at the 24-h period. The range of the null model distributions at any period extends only to include Fourier scores of about 0.4, whereas there are dozens of transcripts with scores above 0.4 in the real data at 24 h. In contrast, the distributions of the real 12- and 16-h oscillatory data are indistinguishable from the null model. Interestingly, there is a modest enrichment in 48-h rhythmicity, a point that will be discussed in detail below.</p><p>To further investigate whether the circadian period dominates transcriptional oscillation, we conducted a spectral analysis of data from eight days of time-course experiments each with a 4-h sampling rate (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). The data were fitted with cosines between 12 and 48 h in period. For each frequency, the number of transcript profiles with at least 30&#x00025;, 40&#x00025;, or 50&#x00025; of their variance accountable by the cosine fit were counted. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020039-g002">Figure 2</xref>B clearly shows that cosine fits of the data produce the largest sets of well-fitted transcript profiles at periods around 24 h.</p><p>These results strongly support the idea that there is extensive control of rhythmic transcription by the circadian clock. They also suggest that circadian expression rhythms are selectively preferred over ultradian or infradian rhythms.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>A Refined Description of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Circadian Expression Program</title><p>To determine the extent of the circadian expression program, we conducted an integrative analysis of all data available from published and unpublished sources. We reasoned that combining microarray data collected from 17 independent days would allow an analysis with greatly increased statistical power. The distribution of 24-h oscillatory statistics in this 17-d integrated dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020039-g002">Figure 2</xref>C) emphasizes the existence of a substantial circadian expression program.</p><p>Marked 24-h periodic trends were also observed in separate analyses for light/dark (LD) time-course data and dark/dark (DD) time-course data. Comparison of the red &#x0201c;LD-only&#x0201d; and green &#x0201c;'DD-only&#x0201d; plots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020039-g002">Figure 2</xref>C reveals the enhancement of daily molecular rhythmicity in the presence of an environmental photocycle. This is further quantified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020039-g002">Figure 2</xref>D; there are substantially more daily transcript oscillations in the presence of an LD cycle than in constant darkness. There are two possible causes of this observation: (1) it may reflect the improved amplitude and synchrony observed for circadian patterns in LD versus DD conditions, and (2) it might reflect the presence of light-dependent transcript oscillations.</p><p>The results of this and other analyses are available in their entirety online (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://flyfits.unil.ch">http://flyfits.unil.ch</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Hundreds of Daily Transcript Oscillations</title><p>From the distribution comparison illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020039-g002">Figure 2</xref>C, we can make estimates of the total number of 24-h transcript oscillations. If we simply choose the transcripts that exceed the highest quantile value (0.216) from the permuted background model, we would find 148 patterns, but this is likely an underestimate. Alternatively, the enrichment in 24-h periodic patterns relative to the permuted background model is maximal (~750 circadian genes) at a spectral power value cut-off of approximately 0.05, roughly where the plot departs from the diagonal, but this is likely an overestimate. In order to interpret our analysis at the level of individual transcripts, it is important to determine how the reliability of our predictions changes over a range of possible cut-off values. We therefore determined the estimated false discovery rate (FDR) over a range of cut-off value stringencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020039-g002">Figure 2</xref>D). The FDR for a set of putative oscillatory transcripts is defined as the number of transcript profiles that would be selected from randomly permuted data divided by the number of transcript profiles actually selected from the real dataset (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). This analysis, when applied to the combined LD &#x0002b; DD data, predicted a daily expression component with greater than 95&#x00025; reliability (FDR &#x0003c; 0.05) for approximately 300 transcripts. Statistical measures representing 24-h rhythmicity in the DD portion of the data (24-h Fourier component and variation with daily time) were then used to verify significant circadian regulation for these transcripts; more than 75&#x00025; passed one of these requirements at <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05, whereas greater than 35&#x00025; passed both tests. Thus, we reliably identify circadian regulation for more than a hundred transcripts.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>No Circadian Transcripts in Adult Heads of Arrhythmic <italic>tim<sup>01</sup></italic> Mutant Flies</title><p>To measure the extent to which circadian transcription is affected in <italic>tim<sup>01</sup></italic> animals, we compared time-series data obtained from this mutant to wild-type flies, and both of these to permuted data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020039-g003">Figure 3</xref>). A direct comparison between 24-h spectral power <italic>(F<sub>24</sub>)</italic> in wild-type and <italic>tim<sup>01</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020039-g003">Figure 3</xref>A) shows that the enrichment detected in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020039-g002">Figure 2</xref>A is preserved under the biological null model provided by <italic>tim<sup>01</sup></italic> data. This demonstrates that LD/DD wild-type data are more rhythmic at the circadian period length than LD/DD <italic>tim<sup>01</sup></italic> data, without excluding that some rhythms might persist in <italic>tim<sup>01</sup></italic>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020039-g003">Figure 3</xref>C addresses the latter issue, using the same permutation model as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020039-g002">Figure 2</xref>A, showing that if at all present, the enrichment is much weaker than that seen using an equal amount of wild-type data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020039-g003">Figure 3</xref>B).</p><p>Nevertheless, the <italic>tim<sup>01</sup></italic> data reveal a number of transcripts with <italic>F<sub>24</sub></italic> scores of approximately 0.7, within the range of values of confirmed oscillatory transcripts in wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020039-g003">Figure 3</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020039-g003">3</xref>C; unpublished data). To systematically test if any reproducible circadian transcript profiles could be detected in the <italic>tim<sup>01</sup></italic> data, we established three selections of genes with the highest potential for circadian oscillations in the <italic>tim<sup>01</sup></italic> flies (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020039-g004">Figure 4</xref>A), and independently tested transcripts by Northern blot analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020039-g004">Figure 4</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020039-g004">4</xref>B; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020039-sg001">Figure S1</xref>). High-ranking (within top 30) candidates from each of the three selections were sampled for our independent verification analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020039-g004">Figure 4</xref>A).</p><p>Using Northern expression analysis of <italic>tim<sup>01</sup></italic> LD/DD time-course experiments, we collected at least one independent expression profile for each of 14 genes. None of these profiles indicated a persistence of circadian regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020039-g004">Figure 4</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020039-g004">4</xref>B; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020039-sg001">Figure S1</xref>). The <italic>F<sub>24</sub></italic> values obtained by Fourier analyses of the Northern data are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020039-g004">Figure 4</xref>A. With the exception of RNAs expressed by <italic>Slob</italic> (Slowpoke binding protein) and <italic>Epac,</italic> all of the transcripts characterized have <italic>F<sub>24</sub></italic> values of less than 0.4 (<italic>pF<sub>24</sub></italic> &#x0003e; 0.1), indicating the absence of significant circadian oscillation. Closer inspection of the results for <italic>Slob</italic> and <italic>Epac</italic> revealed that light-dependent rather than <italic>tim</italic>-independent circadian responses are associated with these genes (as discussed further below). Indeed, during the transition from the LD cycle to the first day of constant darkness, oscillatory amplitude dampens approximately 3-fold for <italic>Slob</italic> and approximately 2-fold for <italic>Epac,</italic> leaving peak-to-trough ratios of 1.8-fold and 1.3-fold, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020039-g004">Figure 4</xref>B). Taken together, our results support the hypotheses that: (1) All circadian transcript oscillations observed in the wild-type data depend on a <italic>tim</italic>-dependent circadian clock, and (2) there is no novel circadian rhythmicity in <italic>tim<sup>01</sup></italic> flies.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Clock-Dependent and Light-Driven Expression Signatures</title><p>As mentioned above, we detected modest 48-h rhythmicity in wild-type LD/DD time-course data (see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020039-sg002">Figure S2</xref>). This observation, along with the apparent rhythmicity of a few transcripts in LD/DD <italic>tim<sup>01</sup></italic> data, led us to believe that the inclusion of LD data in our analyses might introduce light-driven oscillations. The presence of oscillations driven by cycling light was also suggested by the increased rhythmicity in LD data when compared with DD data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020039-g002">Figure 2</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020039-g002">2</xref>D). To verify the existence of light-driven rhythms, we compared genome-wide 24-h periodicity in separate LD-only and DD-only datasets for wild-type and arrhythmic <italic>per<sup>0</sup> (period<sup>0</sup>)</italic> and <italic>tim<sup>01</sup></italic> mutant flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020039-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Comparison of separate wild-type LD and DD spectral power distributions exposes the stimulation of daily transcript oscillations by the environmental LD cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020039-g005">Figure 5</xref>B). When the analogous comparison for arrhythmic mutant flies is performed, the DD-only plot confirms the absence of a circadian clock, but the LD-only plot demonstrates the presence of a broad program of light-driven oscillations that occur independently of a functional clock (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020039-g005">Figure 5</xref>C).

To test this hypothesis directly we analyzed light-dependent expression responses in dark-raised <italic>tim<sup>01</sup></italic> flies that were given a single light pulse of either 6 or 24 h in length. All surveyed transcripts (17) responded to this type of light treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020039-g007">Figure 7</xref>A, columns 5 and 6; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020039-g007">Figure 7</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020039-g007">7</xref>C; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020039-sg003">Figure S3</xref>).

In light of the minor role of CRY, we turned our attention to the role of the light-sensing organs. Since <italic>norpA,</italic> which encodes the phospholipase C component of the visual transduction pathway, had been shown to play a key role in mediating CRY-independent photo-entrainment &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020039-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d;, we conducted two experiments addressing its potential involvement in mediating light-driven transcript responses. In the first experiment we studied the expression profile of 16 light-regulated transcripts in a synchronous population of <italic>norpA<sup>7</sup></italic> or <italic>norpA<sup>39</sup></italic> flies during a single LD photocycle and a subsequent day in constant darkness (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). Thirteen of these transcripts clearly require NORPA for their light-driven behavior, whereas the results for two of the remaining three transcripts were inconclusive due to the presence of synchronous circadian regulation <italic>(CG2121</italic> and <italic>CG5798)</italic>. In a second experiment, we measured mRNA expression profiles in dark-raised <italic>norpA<sup>7</sup>; tim<sup>01</sup></italic> flies that received a single light pulse of either 6 or 24 h in length. The light pulse&#x02013;induced responses observed in <italic>tim<sup>01</sup></italic> flies were clearly decreased in the <italic>norpA<sup>7</sup>; tim<sup>01</sup></italic> double mutants. In five out of six cases, the responses were not detectable at all (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020039-g007">Figure 7</xref>A, see columns 5 and 6, and 11 and 12). Over all, there were only two instances in which we found possible residual light responses in a <italic>norpA</italic> mutant context. The <italic>norpA<sup>39</sup></italic> LD/DD time course for <italic>CG14186</italic> showed a somewhat enhanced fluctuation in LD when compared to DD and there was a marginal 6-h light pulse response in <italic>norpA<sup>7</sup>; tim<sup>01</sup></italic> flies for <italic>CG2121</italic>. However, even in these two cases, the light responses were clearly reduced in the absence of NORPA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020039-g007">Figure 7</xref>A; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020039-sg003">Figure S3</xref>). Taken together, our results suggest that photocycle-dependent transcript oscillations depend on NORPA. To address the question whether NORPA carried out this function in the adult compound eyes, we compared the expression levels of light-regulated genes in the heads of <italic>eya<sup>2</sup></italic> mutant flies, which lack the compound eyes, to those in wild-type flies using microarray analysis. For all light-driven genes described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020039-g006">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020039-g007">7</xref>, the average expression signal observed in <italic>eya<sup>2</sup></italic> mutant heads was lower than that found for wild-type controls, and this trend was highly statistically significant (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020039-sg004">Figure S4</xref>). Moreover, the fact that the expression signal for a number of confirmed light-driven genes in <italic>eya<sup>2</sup></italic> did not exceed background noise (unpublished data) indicates that our observations of light-dependent regulation of these genes in wild-type heads indeed reflects regulation in the compound eyes. Thus, at least some of the light-dependent regulation that we identified apparently occurs downstream of the phototransduction pathway in the compound eyes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3a"><title>A New Strategy for Identifying Oscillatory Trends in Microarray Data</title><p>In recent years, five different sets of circadian transcripts have been proposed for the <italic>Drosophila</italic> head in as many publications &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020039-b015">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020039-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;. Unfortunately, the overlap between these transcript sets is very poor (seven transcripts), and it falsely excludes numerous confirmed circadian transcript oscillations. These recent genome-wide surveys for rhythmic transcription have defined groups of circadian transcripts based on empirical ranking and filtering approaches, often using necessarily arbitrary cut-offs. To complement these studies we developed a method for examining periodic expression at the systems level, allowing us to pursue a number of new investigations. This new strategy enabled us to describe the programs of circadian and light-driven transcription in the adult fly head. Because our method emphasizes uniformity in period length and peak phase while tolerating inter-experimental variability in amplitude, it is particularly successful at measuring oscillatory trends across different independent experiments. Integrative analysis of all available microarray time-series data allowed detection and ranking of oscillatory transcript profiles with improved resolution and revealed a circadian expression program that is much more substantial than the apparent consensus (or lack thereof) between different published studies indicates. Some of the best described and strongest circadian oscillations <italic>(per, Clk, Pdp1, cry,</italic> and <italic>to)</italic> were missed in one or more of the previously published studies, but all of these rank high in our integrative analysis. Although there are relatively few genes (~50, unpublished data) that show the same level of circadian regulation as the oscillating components in the core clock circuits <italic>(per, tim, Clk, cry, vri,</italic> and <italic>Pdp1)</italic>, our results provide evidence for a substantially broader circadian expression program downstream of the core oscillator. This suggests that the circadian clock is responsible for both the purely circadian expression patterns of a limited set of genes and the partial circadian regulation of a much greater group.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>One Transcriptional Clock in <italic>Drosophila</italic></title><p>Whereas many of the genes composing the <italic>Drosophila</italic> clock are expressed with a circadian rhythm in wild-type flies, all known clock gene oscillations cease if just one of them is lost by mutation (reviewed in &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020039-b002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020039-b003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020039-b008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020039-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;).

A model for the program of light-dependent transcription in plants is emerging from studies dissecting photic signaling pathways (e.g., &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020039-b049">49</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020039-b051">51</xref>&#x0005d;) and from genome-wide expression analyses (as reviewed in &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020039-b052">52</xref>&#x0005d;). Light-dependent expression in fungi and animals has not yet been explored as thoroughly.

One apparent difference between our genome-wide analysis in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and observations of individual light-responsive transcripts in other organisms is that we have not uncovered evidence for light-dependent control of genes encoding known components of the circadian clock. A possible explanation for this discrepancy is that by conducting our analyses with <italic>tim<sup>01</sup></italic> mutant flies, we have chosen to identify light-regulated transcripts that do not require a working clock or the TIM-dependent photic input pathway. In a wild-type context, phase-resetting of the clock with a light pulse during the early night leads to degradation of cytoplasmic TIM and a relative increase in the levels of <italic>per</italic> and <italic>tim</italic> mRNA, whereas a light pulse during the late night causes degradation of nuclear TIM and has the opposite effect on <italic>per</italic> and <italic>tim</italic> expression &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020039-b064">64</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020039-b066">66</xref>&#x0005d;. Other CLK/CYC-induced transcripts are likely to show behavior similar to that of <italic>per</italic> and <italic>tim</italic> in response to light pulses. Given the light-entrainable properties of the circadian clock all circadian transcripts will ultimately respond to photic input, but depending on their distance from TIM in the regulatory circuits of the clock they may adjust earlier or later in response to a phase-resetting light pulse. In <italic>Neurospora,</italic> transcription of the clock gene <italic>frq</italic> is induced by light via the photo-receptive white collar-1/white collar-2 transcription complexes, and this response is intimately connected to photo-entrainment of the molecular clockworks &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020039-b054">54</xref>&#x0005d;. In the mouse, <italic>mPer1</italic> may have a similar role in resetting the clock, because it is activated in response to light in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN).

We, therefore, asked whether these light-driven transcript responses depend on the same light sensors as the circadian system. We found that for the most part light-driven regulation does not require CRY.

There is one interesting exception to this rule: The light-mediated repression of the <italic>Slob</italic> transcript apparently requires CRY, but not TIM.

Based on the overlapping expression of both NORPA and its target transcripts in the adult compound eyes and NORPA's well-documented role in phototransduction, the simplest interpretation of our observations would be that light-driven expression responses are mediated by visual phototransduction. Nevertheless, NORPA is known to be expressed outside of the visual organs &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020039-b095">95</xref>&#x0005d;, and it has been reported to affect functions unrelated to phototransduction, such as olfaction &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020039-b096">96</xref>&#x0005d; and temperature-controlled clock gene oscillations &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020039-b097">97</xref>&#x0005d;. Additionally, <italic>norpA</italic> loss-of-function mutants show a number of defects in circadian locomotor behavior.

Photoperiodic control of transcripts associated with functions in visual sensitivity <italic>(trpl</italic> and <italic>CdsA)</italic> and synaptic transmission <italic>(Slob</italic> and <italic>dlg1)</italic> may be relevant to adaptive responses in the visual system and the brain. NORPA's involvement in both regulating <italic>per</italic> splicing and mediating photoresponses at the transcript level raises questions as to if and how these two molecular functions are connected. One possibility is that both reflect NORPA-dependent selective regulation of mRNA stability that takes place in the compound eyes (and perhaps also the brain). Whether or not NORPA's function in circadian locomotor behavior involves some of the light-dependent expression responses that we have identified could be examined by targeted misexpression studies. The subset of transcripts that have been independently confirmed to exhibit both NORPA-dependent light responses and strong clock-dependent circadian regulation might be particularly relevant to these experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s3h"><title>Conclusions</title><p>A new strategy for analyzing oscillatory patterns in microarrray data has allowed us to answer general questions about oscillatory gene systems in the fly head. By applying this strategy to 17 d of data, we were able to conclusively demonstrate that there are more than a hundred circadian transcript oscillations in the fly head. Additionally, in a search for rhythmic gene activity over a wide range of periods (from 12 to 48 h), we established that 24-h periodicity constitutes the only broad program of transcriptional oscillation. We further found that the <italic>tim-</italic>dependent clock is the sole transcriptional circadian clock in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.

Lastly, we found a novel, light-regulated system of gene regulation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> that is largely dependent on <italic>norpA</italic>-mediated phototransduction. This system regulates about the same number of genes as the clock, including a number of circadian genes. Our study defines three types of transcripts that oscillate in wild-type flies: those from purely clock-regulated genes, those that are purely photocycle-regulated, and those expressed by genes that respond to both inputs.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Fly strains.</title><p>This study made use of &#x0201c;wild-type&#x0201d; strains <italic>y w</italic> and <italic>Canton S</italic> as well as mutant strains <italic>y w; tim<sup>01</sup>, y w per<sup>0</sup>, Clk<sup>jrk</sup>, cry<sup>b</sup>, norpA<sup>39</sup>, norpA<sup>7</sup>,</italic> and <italic>norpA<sup>7</sup>; tim<sup>01</sup>.</italic></p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Microarray experiments.</title><p>After eclosion <italic>y w</italic> or <italic>y w; tim<sup>01</sup></italic> were entrained to a 12-h:12-h LD cycle at 25 &#x000b0;C for 3 d and harvested onto dry ice at 4-h intervals during the next day of LD entrainment and an additional day of free-running in constant darkness (DD).

Such rhythms could indicate the presence of a novel, non-circadian oscillator active in wild-type fly heads. However, we favor another explanation, namely that the increase in 48-h periodic patterns reflects the presence of light-dependent gene responses. Recall that our experimental format used flies collected over a 48-h interval composed of 1 d of photo-entrainment (LD) followed by a second day of constant darkness (DD). We understand why such patterns appear as 48-h rhythms: An idealized time trace locked to the external light condition, namely a 12/36-h on/off step-like pattern, would lead to a spectral power of 0.55 at 48 h and 0.29 at 24 h. Note that 0.55 is close to the highest measured values found in the 48-h panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020039-g002">Figure 2</xref>A, so a 12/36-h on/off pattern would be detected predominantly in the 48-h spectrum.

Upward deviations from the diagonals indicate global enrichment in time traces with that periodicity, while downward deviations indicate depletion. The ticks on the right show the number of profiles that exceed a certain Fourier value, emphasizing that the enrichments at 24 and 48 h are tail effects that affect no more than approximately 5&#x00025; of the genome.

The data were fitted with cosines, and then sets of transcript profiles were chosen based on how much of their variance was due to the cosine fit. Invariably, fitting the data with 24-h period cosines produced the largest sets (as indicated by the vertical axis). Each of the three curves is the same analysis done at different levels of fit stringency, with the black curve (&#x0201c;Residual Variance &#x0003c; 50&#x00025;&#x0201d;) being the most stringent selection.</p><p>(C) The contours of an extensive circadian expression program emerge from a comprehensive meta-analysis.
