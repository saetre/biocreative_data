However, findings have been inconsistent in various cancers, and ethnicity appears to be a critical factor influencing the effects of the SNP on cancer risk. An increasing trend has been observed in the prevalence of lung cancers in non-smokers, especially females, though the underlying genetic basis is unclear.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We therefore examined the role of the SNPs in the p53 pathway (<italic>p53 </italic>codon 72 and <italic>MDM2 </italic>SNP309) on lung cancer risk and prognosis of a life-time non-smoking female Chinese population, in a hospital-based case-control study of 123 cases and 159 age-matched controls, by PCR analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Our findings reveal that the risk of lung cancer among individuals with the <italic>MDM2 </italic>SNP309 TT genotype was 2.1 (95% CI 1.01-4.36) relative to the GG genotype, contrary to initial expectations that the GG genotype with elevated MDM2 levels will increase cancer risk. Those who had this genotype in combination with the <italic>p53 </italic>Pro allele had a risk of 2.5 (95% CI 1.2-5.0). There was however no effect of either polymorphism on age at diagnosis of lung cancer or on overall survival.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The results thus demonstrate that the MDM2 SNP309 TT rather than the GG genotype is associated with increased risk of lung cancer in this population, suggesting that other mechanisms independent of increased MDM2 levels can influence cancer susceptibility.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The TP53 tumour suppressor pathway plays a critical role in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis in many cancers, including lung carcinomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], and variation in the genes that regulate this pathway may exert an important influence on tumour development, and hence, cancer risk. Recent interest has focused on the murine double minute-2 protein (MDM2), a nuclear phospoprotein that inhibits p53 activity by promoting its degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP309) in the <italic>MDM2 </italic>promoter has been found to influence transcription of this gene via a greater affinity for the SP1 transcription factor, and hence, individuals with the GG genotype have higher MDM2 levels leading to attenuation of the p53 pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. This has been especially so in the case of females, due to the involvement of the MDM2 SNP in the estrogen receptor signaling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Several epidemiologic studies have evaluated this association with varying results. No overall association between <italic>MDM2 </italic>SNP309 and lung cancer risk was observed in recent studies in a European [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], North American [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and two Asian [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] populations. However, the GG genotype was observed to increase risk in a study in China [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], Norway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and among non-Hispanic Whites in the US [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In some cases, even though there was no overall association noted with the <italic>MDM2 </italic>SNP309 and cancer susceptibility, substratification of groups led to some association. For example, an increased risk was correlated with the GG genotype only in the adenocarcinomas, but not in the small cell, squamous cell or non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLCs), or when all lung cancer subtypes were grouped [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Other studies pointed to an interaction with smoking status - although no association was found between all lung cancers and the <italic>MDM2 </italic>SNP309, there was an elevated risk of cancer susceptibility in smokers compared to non-smokers in the same study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Conversely, one study found that the risk of lung cancer was higher among individuals with the TT genotype - on stratification, this association was restricted to males and to smokers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. A meta-analysis of seven studies concluded that the GG genotype conferred a small but significant increased risk (summary odds ratio [OR] 1.27; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.12-1.44) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Because of the capacity of the polymorphism to enhance the inhibitory action of MDM2 on the p53 pathway, investigators have hypothesized that the GG genotype would also negatively influence prognosis in lung cancer. To date, two studies have demonstrated that the GG genotype is associated with a lower level of p53 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and with poorer survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>A polymorphism at codon 72 of the <italic>p53 </italic>gene resulting in an arginine-to-proline (Arg/Pro respectively) substitution has also been shown to be varyingly associated with cancer predisposition, possibly due to differences in ethnicity and in background risk due to smoking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. A meta-analysis of 13 epidemiologic studies which examined this association reported that the summary odds ratio of lung cancer associated with the Pro/Pro genotype was 1.18 (95% CI 0.99-1.41), and was 1.02 (95% CI 0.86-1.20) for Pro-carriers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The Pro/Pro genotype has also been associated with poorer prognosis and less favorable clinical outcome in lung cancer patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Moreover, significantly higher or a lower prevalence of <italic>p53 </italic>gene mutations have been noted in lung cancers among carriers of the Pro allele in the Polish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] or a Norwegian population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], respectively. These data highlight that ethnicity and other factors may have an impact on p53 functionality, with respect to the SNP and mutational status.</p><p>The influence of gender and ethnic differences on genetic determinants of lung cancer is increasingly being recognized. Smoking accounts for the overwhelming majority of cases in Western populations and among men, but lung cancer among non-smokers is now known to be a distinct clinico-pathologic entity that is as yet poorly understood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. We therefore sought to examine if MDM2, through its role in the p53 pathway, is associated with risk and prognosis of lung cancer among Singapore Chinese women, a primarily non-smoking population. In addition, as <italic>MDM2 </italic>SNP309 status has been demonstrated to affect the overall age of onset of various cancers, with differential effects in different populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], we have explored its effects in this unique population.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study population</title><p>Participants were drawn from a hospital-based case-control study on lung cancer among Chinese women in Singapore [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Incident cases were primary lung cancers diagnosed at any one of three major hospitals in the country over the study period, and controls were patients admitted to the same hospitals, frequency-matched by age. Patients admitted for malignant or chronic respiratory conditions (chronic bronchitis, emphysema and chronic asthma) were not eligible to participate as controls. All participants provided written consent. Within this study population, a consecutive sub-sample of participants were asked, and consented to provide a blood specimen for genetic analysis. Of these, 126 cases (95.2% of which were pathologically confirmed) and 162 controls were never smokers and form the basis for the current report. The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the National Cancer Centre and the Institutional Review Board of the National University of Singapore.</p><p>Demographic, smoking and other relevant information was obtained by in-person interview with a trained nurse.

The presence of the <italic>p53 </italic>codon 72 Pro allele did not lead to a statistically significant interaction or materially affect the magnitude of this risk. Neither of the <italic>MDM2 </italic>nor <italic>p53 </italic>polymorphisms evaluated showed any impact on survival or age of onset of lung cancer in this population.</p><p>Our study population is unique in consisting solely of non-smoking women, who could potentially be informative with regard to risk factors that operate independently of tobacco smoking. The finding that the <italic>MDM2 </italic>TT genotype increases risk was unexpected, since as described earlier, many studies that have reported associations have found increased risk with the GG genotype that are consistent with the impact of this genotype on <italic>MDM2 </italic>RNA and protein levels, and hence, on inhibition of p53 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. To our knowledge, only one study has examined the combined effect of <italic>MDM2 </italic>and <italic>p53 </italic>polymorphisms and lung cancer, and this was also conducted in a Chinese population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The results showed a multiplicative effect, with a 4.5-fold higher risk in those with the GG, Pro/Pro genotypes relative to TT, Arg/Arg. However, our findings suggesting that TT genotype can be a susceptibility factor are not entirely surprising, given the recent observations. Recent work using large numbers of breast cancer samples in the Chinese female population also revealed that the TT genotype predisposes to accelerated onset of cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], and that the GG genotype reduced risk of leukemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Moreover, one other study has noted association of increased lung cancer risk with the TT genotype in the Chinese population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], supporting our data. Thus, it is possible that the association of the G or the T alleles with increased cancer risk or onset age may be influenced by ethnicity and by environmental factors unique to that particular population. More in depth larger scale studies are now required to further extend these findings.</p><p>How does the TT genotype lead to increased cancer risk is at present not well understood, but there is evidence to suggest that the role of MDM2 in tumorigenesis may vary in a gender-specific manner, and between smokers and never smokers. Thus, it is not inconceivable that the mechanisms by which MDM2 modulates lung cancer risk can differ between populations. The role of hormones in carcinogenesis is rapidly emerging as a complex, but important pathway. Estrogen signaling, in particular the estrogen receptor (ER), is known to play a direct role in <italic>MDM2 </italic>transcription, regulating its expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The G allele of SNP309 increases the affinity of the <italic>MDM2 </italic>promoter for Sp1, a co-transcriptional activator for the estrogen receptor, and was associated with increased MDM2 expression. Consistently, Bond et. al. showed that the effect of the <italic>MDM2 </italic>polymorphism (GG) was gender-specific and enhanced in women with active estrogen signaling pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Therefore, one would envisage that the TT genotype is associated with reduced MDM2 levels. However, MDM2 has also been shown to negatively regulate ER expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Thus, it is possible that reduced MDM2 levels expected in TT individuals could lead to elevated ER expression, and hence may elevate cancer risk - a hypothesis that requires further investigation. Given that estrogen receptors are expressed in lung tumours, particularly adenocarcinomas, and these cells are responsive to estrogen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], it is possible that hormonal pathways provide an alternative mechanism by which MDM2 influences lung cancer risk in this population. Alternatively, other MDM2-dependent pathways could be modified in the TT subjects, leading to cancer susceptibility. In this respect, no studies have evaluated if specific signaling pathways are associated with the MDM2 SNPs. Given the emergence of an association of the TT genotype with cancer susceptibility in various studies, such analyses would provide further mechanistic insights.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, our findings suggest that the <italic>MDM2 </italic>SNP309 TT genotype is a risk factor for lung cancer in never-smoker Chinese females. The difference between our results and others highlights the possibility that MDM2 may operate via unique mechanisms among non-smoking Asian women.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>HWC, DN, SC, SSL and LYS carried out the molecular genetics studies.
