We developed an in vivo organelle tethering assaying in which GRASP65 was targeted to the mitochondrial outer membrane either directly or via binding to GM130. Mitochondria bearing GRASP65 became tethered to one another, and this depended on a GRASP65 PDZ domain that was also required for GRASP65 self-interaction. Point mutation within the predicted binding groove of the GRASP65 PDZ domain blocked both tethering and, in a gene replacement assay, Golgi ribbon formation. Tethering also required proximate membrane anchoring of the PDZ domain, suggesting a mechanism that orientates the PDZ binding groove to favor interactions in trans. Thus, a homotypic PDZ interaction mediates organelle tethering in living cells.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Intracellular organelles form membrane networks through fusion and fission events, which must be tightly regulated to preserve organelle identity and morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Voeltz and Prinz, 2007</xref>). In mammals the Golgi apparatus forms a ribbon-like network comprised of laterally linked stacked cisternae, or ministacks. Each ministack is comprised of subcompartments that carry out ordered processing reactions on cargo passing through the organelle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Puthenveedu and Linstedt, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pfeffer, 2007</xref>). The lateral linkages that connect adjacent ministacks are homotypic and dynamic. That is, analogous cisternal subcompartments are linked with each other and both fusion and fission occur at the sites of contact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Colanzi and Corda, 2007</xref>). Disruption of the lateral connections is associated with increased deviation in enzyme distribution among ministacks and processing deficiencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Puthenveedu et al., 2006</xref>). The linkages also appear to act as a control point in cell cycle progression, as a MAP kinase pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acharya et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yoshimura et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shaul and Seger, 2006</xref>) triggers unlinking of the Golgi ribbon in late G2 phase of the cell cycle and blockade of this event delays entry into M phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Feinstein and Linstedt, 2007</xref>). Lateral linkage of the Golgi ribbon may also be regulated to allow repositioning of the Golgi apparatus to face the wound edge during the cellular response to a scratch wound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bisel et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Two of the identified factors required for ribbon formation are the golgin GM130 and its binding partner GRASP65 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Puthenveedu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Marra et al., 2007</xref>), which is also required for reassembly of Golgi stacks in an in vitro assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barr et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wang et al., 2003</xref>). In the absence of GM130 or GRASP65 the Golgi apparatus is fragmented into ministacks that nevertheless mostly retain their juxtanuclear positioning and transport competence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sutterlin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Puthenveedu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kodani and Sutterlin, 2008</xref>). Significantly, although knockdown of GRASP65 leaves GM130 properly localized on the Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sutterlin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Puthenveedu et al., 2006</xref>), knockdown of GM130 causes loss of GRASP65 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Puthenveedu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kodani and Sutterlin, 2008</xref>). Further, GM130 function requires its ability to bind GRASP65 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Puthenveedu et al., 2006</xref>). Based on these findings and the demonstrated ability of the GRASP65 N terminus, which contains a tandem array of PDZ-like domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barr et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kuo et al., 2000</xref>), to form homo-oligomeric structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wang et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">2005</xref>), we hypothesized that GM130 recruits GRASP65 to the Golgi membrane and that GRASP65 mediates homotypic tethering of adjacent cis cisternae via oligomeric interactions in trans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Puthenveedu et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>However, evidence that the GM130&#x02013;GRASP65 complex plays a direct role in organelle tethering is lacking, as is a detailed understanding of how it might work. The finding that GRASP65 oligomerizes forming complexes in trans was performed with protein purified from bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wang et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">2005</xref>). These preparations were not myristoylated, were studied in the absence of membranes, and formed large polydisperse complexes leaving the physiological context of a key aspect of the hypothesis that GRASP65 oligomers bridge membranes an open question. Further, although oligomerization activity mapped to the N-terminal region containing PDZ-like domains, it is not clear whether either or both of these domains mediate the interaction, whether the interaction involves a bona fide PDZ domain interaction, or whether these domains even form PDZ domains at all. Finally, the validity of the model in which GM130&#x02013;GRASP65 complexes bridge membranes to mediate Golgi ribbon formation is further complicated by recent findings that implicate the proteins in nonclassical secretion occurring outside the Golgi apparatus at specific points of development of two nonvertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kinseth et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schotman et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Thus, to investigate their sufficiency in organelle tethering in a physiological context, GM130 and GRASP65 constructs were expressed on the mitochondrial outer membrane of mammalian cells containing or lacking endogenous mitochondrial tethering factors. Paralleling its activity at the Golgi, GM130 recruited GRASP65 and GRASP65 was necessary and sufficient for mitochondrial tethering. Tethering depended on the predicted ligand-binding groove of a self-interacting GRASP65 PDZ domain, and mutation of this predicted groove to block tethering also blocked Golgi ribbon formation. The combined results indicate that, after recruitment by GM130, GRASP65 homotypic PDZ-type interactions mediate organelle tethering.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Organelle clustering induced by GRASP65</title><p>As a test of the hypothesis that GRASP65 directly cross-bridges membranes, we expressed in HeLa cells a modified version of GRASP65 containing a C-terminal membrane anchor sequence specifying targeting to the mitochondrial outer membrane.

G65-GFP-ActA also colocalized with Mitotracker staining, indicating mitochondrial targeting but, in striking contrast with GFP-ActA, G65-GFP-ActA expression had a profound effect on mitochondrial location and appearance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, J&#x02013;M</xref>). The mitochondria became clustered in the juxtanuclear region of the cells with little or no mitochondrial staining remaining elsewhere in the cytoplasm. The Golgi apparatus, which appeared intermingled with the clustered mitochondria, was fragmented in these cells. The mitochondrial clusters were strikingly similar to those induced by overexpression of the mitofusin proteins that normally tether mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Koshiba et al., 2004</xref>), suggesting that G65-GFP-ActA was tethering the membranes to one another.</p><p>To exclude the possibility that the juxtanuclear clustering induced by G65-GFP-ActA depended on interaction with Golgi membranes, cells expressing GFP-ActA or G65-GFP-ActA were treated with brefeldin A (BFA). As expected, BFA induced Golgi collapse in control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, N&#x02013;Q</xref>) and in cells expressing G65-GFP-ActA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, R&#x02013;U</xref>), and mitochondrial clusters persisted in the latter. In fact, the clusters frequently appeared tighter suggesting that, in the absence of BFA, the Golgi membranes partially constrained, or otherwise limited, interactions between the clustered mitochondria.</p><p>To obtain a quantitative measure of the extent of mitochondrial spread in the transfected cells, a radial profile algorithm was used. For each cell, the algorithm measured the mean signal intensity for a series of concentric circles emanating from the calculated centroid of the fluorescent signal. Average values from many cells over multiple experiments were then used to generate radial profile plots in which the fraction of total mean intensity is expressed as a function of distance from the centroid. The radial profile plot for cells expressing the GFP-ActA control construct was essentially flat, reflecting the uniform spread of the mitochondria throughout the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 V</xref>). In contrast, a clearly significant clustering was evident in cells expressing G65-GFP-ActA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 W</xref>), and this was slightly accentuated in G65-GFP-ActA&#x02013;expressing cells treated with BFA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 X</xref>). These results indicate that GRASP65, when targeted to the mitochondrial outer membrane, is sufficient to induce organelle clustering.</p><p>Nocodazole-induced microtubule disassembly was used to test whether clustering depended on an intact microtubule network. Untreated cells expressing the GFP-ActA control construct exhibited filamentous tubulin staining and filamentous mitochondria and nocodazole converted the tubulin pattern from filamentous to diffuse, and this reduced the filamentous appearance of mitochondria, which, nevertheless, remained dispersed throughout the cytoplasm (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200902110/DC1">Fig. S1</ext-link>, A&#x02013;D). Significantly, nocodazole had no effect on mitochondrial morphology or distribution in G65-GFP-ActA&#x02013;expressing cells. That is, mitochondria were found in juxtanuclear clusters in cells lacking microtubules (Fig. S1, E&#x02013;H). Thus, in contrast to nocodazole-sensitive mitochondrial clustering involving recruitment of motor and/or microtubule binding activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hoogenraad et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rios et al., 2004</xref>), the microtubule independence GRASP65-mediated clustering argues that it is likely a direct effect of crossbridging the mitochondrial membranes and forming a large structure that, for steric reasons, occupies the juxtanuclear area.</p><p>Next, electron microscopy was performed on the BFA-treated transfected cells to assess the ultrastructure of the clustered mitochondria. In untransfected cells, and in cells transfected with the GFP-ActA control plasmid, mitochondria were evident throughout the entire cytoplasm and were frequently well separated from each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, A and B</xref>). As expected, the filamentous aspect apparent using fluorescence microscopy was not evident, presumably due to the low probability of obtaining thin sections with longitudinal profiles of membrane tubules. In contrast, cells transfected with G65-GFP-ActA had prominent clusters of mitochondria in the juxtanuclear region and the remaining cytoplasm was essentially devoid of mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, C and D</xref>). Unlike Golgi stacks, which have extended zones of apposition with uniform gap widths, the mitochondria in the clusters were apposed mostly at discrete sites and at a greater distance. Other membranes may be present within the clusters. Nevertheless, an immunofluorescence assay (not depicted) failed to reveal any accumulation in the clusters of calnexin, an ER marker, or ERGIC53, a marker of the intermediate compartment that accumulates in BFA remnants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Seemann et al., 2000</xref>). Interestingly, the outer membranes of individual mitochondria appeared distinct from neighboring outer membranes, suggesting maintenance of mitochondrial integrity within the cluster. Absence of syncytia formation was further supported by FRAP experiments. Cells expressing the control construct, GFP-ActA, exhibited an extended mitochondrial network, and when a small region of the network was bleached, fluorescence was rapidly recovered in the bleached structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, E&#x02013;H</xref>, movie and quantification in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200902110/DC1">Video 1</ext-link>). This is the expected behavior for a contiguous membrane network established by membrane fusion. In contrast, cells expressing the G65-GFP-ActA construct exhibited a juxtanuclear cluster of mitochondria and there was no recovery of fluorescence observed after photobleaching small portions of the clustered membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, I&#x02013;L</xref>, movie and quantification in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200902110/DC1">Video 2</ext-link>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Mitochondria are tethered and not fused into syncytia.</bold> GFP-ActA (A and B) or G65-GFP-ActA (C and D) transfected HeLa cells were BFA treated, processed for electron microscopy, and shown at 2 magnifications.

The cells were also treated with BFA to disperse Golgi membranes. The GFP-ActA control colocalized with COX-IV-DsRed and the mitochondria appeared as discrete punctate structures distributed throughout the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, M&#x02013;O</xref>).

Further, because COX-IV-DsRed and G65-GFP-ActA were localized to the matrix and the outer membrane, respectively, it was possible to distinguish individual mitochondria in the clusters after acquiring single optical sections by confocal microscopy. This analysis provided strong evidence that, instead of undergoing fusion to form syncytia, mitochondria remained intact as discrete entities each containing an outer membrane compartment surrounding a matrix compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, S&#x02013;U</xref>).</p><p>The experiments in this section argue that G65-GFP-ActA tethers adjacent mitochondria to generate juxtanuclear clusters. To verify that interactions in trans mediated mitochondrial clustering, HeLa cells expressing G65-GFP-ActA were fused to HeLa cells expressing either mCherry-ActA or G65-mCherry-ActA. Cycloheximide was used to prevent new protein synthesis and the mitochondria in the resulting heterokaryons were analyzed. Importantly, mitochondria bearing the control construct mCherry-ActA mostly remained strikingly distinct from mitochondria bearing G65-GFP-ActA in that the former retained the filamentous morphology characteristic of control mitochondria, whereas the latter remained clustered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, A&#x02013;C</xref>). Further, the mitochondria bearing G65-mCherry-ActA coalesced with mitochondria bearing G65-GFP-ActA into single clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, D&#x02013;F</xref>). Thus, clustering depended on GRASP65 being present in both membranes. Due to a low transfection frequency, we were unable to achieve dual-labeled heterokaryons with <italic>mfn</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells, thus the apparent mixing of the two markers in HeLa cells could be attributed to mitofusin-dependent membrane fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Legros et al., 2002</xref>) or membrane transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Neuspiel et al., 2008</xref>) in the 3 h following cell fusion.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>GRASP65 must be present in opposing mitochondrial membranes.</bold> G65-GFP-ActA&#x02013;transfected HeLa cells were seeded together with either mCherry-ActA (A&#x02013;C) or G65-mCherry-ActA (D&#x02013;F) transfected HeLa cells, and the cells were fused with polyethylene glycol.

Therefore, a strong prediction is that targeting of GM130 to mitochondria would also induce mitochondrial clustering, but in a manner dependent on its ability to recruit GRASP65. To test this idea, we targeted the GM130 C terminus, which contains the GRASP65 binding site, to mitochondria. One technical challenge was that targeting GM130 to mitochondria required a distinct strategy because GM130 uses its C terminus to interact with GRASP65 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barr et al., 1998</xref>) and the ActA C-terminal membrane anchor was likely to interfere with this interaction. Fortunately, a search for outer membrane targeting sequences that could be used at the N terminus yielded a sequence in TOM20, a component of the outer membrane translocator complex. The N-terminal 40 amino acids of TOM20 contain a membrane-anchoring domain that orients such that the C-terminal hydrophilic sequences are exposed to the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Waizenegger et al., 2003</xref>), and this domain is sufficient for mitochondrial targeting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kanaji et al., 2000</xref>). Thus, we generated the constructs diagrammed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref>) containing the TOM20 signal anchor followed by GFP alone (T20-GFP) or by GFP and the C-terminal 100 amino acids of GM130 (T20-GFP-GM130<sup>Cterm</sup>).

In BFA-treated cells GRASP65 is known to be principally associated with remnant membrane structures localized adjacent to distributed ER exit sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Seemann et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ward et al., 2001</xref>). Consistent with this localization, GRASP65 was present in dispersed punctate structures in cells expressing T20-GFP, which itself was localized to filamentous mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5, A&#x02013;D</xref>). In striking contrast, GRASP65 localization was largely juxtanuclear in cells expressing T20-GFP-GM130<sup>Cterm</sup>, and it was clearly evident on the clustered mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5, E&#x02013;H</xref>). In the case of cells expressing T20-GFP-GM130<sup>C&#x00394;10</sup>, GRASP65 retained the control BFA remnant pattern and was distinct from the filamentous mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5, J&#x02013;M</xref>). GRASP65 coincidence with the GFP constructs was analyzed on a pixel-by-pixel basis and the quantified results indicated significant specific recruitment of endogenous GRASP65 to mitochondria by T20-GFP-GM130<sup>Cterm</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 N</xref>). Thus, the GM130 C terminus recruited endogenous GRASP65 to mitochondria and this induced their clustering. Because GM130 is required for GRASP65 localization to Golgi membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Puthenveedu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kodani and Sutterlin, 2008</xref>) and because the GRASP65 binding site in GM130 is required for GM130-dependent Golgi linking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Puthenveedu et al., 2006</xref>), these results strongly suggest that GM130 links Golgi ribbons by recruiting GRASP65, which in turn is sufficient to link membranes. Additionally, the results show that endogenous levels of GRASP65 are sufficient to induce mitochondrial clustering, ruling out concerns regarding overexpression of exogenous constructs.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p><bold>Endogenous GRASP65 is recruited to mitochondria by GM130.</bold> HeLa cells expressing T20-GFP (A&#x02013;D), T20-GFP-GM130<sup>Cterm</sup> (E&#x02013;H), or T20-GFP-GM130<sup>C&#x00394;10</sup> (J&#x02013;M) were BFA treated and processed to reveal GFP fluorescence, GRASP65 staining, merged images and, from single optical sections, representations of the colocalized pixels.

Thus, the homotypic PDZ1 interaction revealed by targeting GRASP65 to the mitochondrial outer membrane underlies its ability to maintain the Golgi ribbon.</p><p>Another outcome of this analysis was the possible separation of function for the two GRASP65 PDZ-like domains in that tethering activity mapped to PDZ1, whereas previous work had mapped the GM130 binding site to the C-terminal end of PDZ2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barr et al., 1998</xref>). To test this prediction, we assayed GRASP65-mediated GM130 recruitment to the mitochondria of BFA-treated cells.

Finally, GM130 was recruited to mitochondria bearing G65<sup>LL58,59SS</sup>-GFP-ActA, which, as expected, failed to cluster mitochondria due to the mutation in PDZ1 (Fig. S5, G&#x02013;I). These results were confirmed by quantifying colocalization of GM130 with the mitochondrial constructs (Fig. S5 J).

Although the G65-GFP-ActA construct is expected to be N-myristoylated, the construct also has a C-terminal transmembrane anchor that would presumably make its membrane integration independent of myristoylation. Indeed, when the construct was modified by alanine substitution of the glycine acceptor site to prevent its myristoylation, the resulting construct, G65<sup>G2A</sup>-GFP-ActA, was targeted to mitochondria as indicated by colocalization with Mitotracker staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8, A&#x02013;D</xref>).

These observations suggest a critical role for membrane association of the N terminus, whether it is mediated by myristic acid or by other means. If so, the crossbridging activity of the nonmyristoylated G65<sup>G2A</sup>-GFP-ActA might be rescued by anchoring its N terminus to the mitochondrial outer membrane. As a test, we generated T20-G65-GFP-Acta, which was expected to be N-terminally anchored but not myristoylated because the nonmyristoylated TOM20 signal sequence was introduced at the N terminus of the GRASP65 sequence. As a negative control, T20-GFP-ActA was generated, which contained both N- and C-terminal membrane anchors but lacked the GRASP65 sequence. Remarkably, expression of T20-G65-GFP-ActA induced mitochondrial clustering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8, E&#x02013;G and L</xref>), whereas the control construct T20-GFP-ActA did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8, H&#x02013;J and M</xref>). These results demonstrate an additional role for the interaction of the GRASP65 N terminus with membranes. Not only does it contribute to stable membrane targeting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barr et al., 1998</xref>), it is also critical for organelle tethering activity. The finding that the TOM20 signal sequence can substitute for the myristic acid contradicts a possibility in which the myristic acid at the GRASP65 N terminus extends out and inserts in trans into adjacent membranes. Instead, the importance of N-terminal membrane association, taken together with the role of the N-terminal PDZ1 domain, argues that membrane insertion of the N terminus activates and/or orients the PDZ1 binding groove so that it can carry out homotypic interactions in trans. This could obviate two potential problems for the homotypic tethering mechanism: interference by cis interactions in the membrane and interference by interactions with the soluble pool, if any. Indeed, overexpressed G65-myc yielded a clear cytosolic pattern, yet this protein did not appear appreciably targeted to mitochondrial clusters bearing G65-GFP-ActA (Fig. S5, K&#x02013;P). Thus, membrane association appears to regulate GRASP65 self-association.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The ability of GRASP65 to participate directly in organelle tethering was tested using two methods of targeting the protein to the cytoplasmic face of the mitochondrial outer membrane. Each yielded clustering of mitochondria in the absence of the microtubule cytoskeleton or an intact Golgi apparatus, arguing that cluster formation was due to crossbridging connections formed by GRASP65. Indeed, the N-terminal domain of GRASP65, which mediates its homo-oligomerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wang et al., 2005</xref>), was required for mitochondrial clustering. Of the two PDZ-like domains present in the GRASP65 N terminus, the first was found to be required for both GRASP65 self-interaction and for mitochondrial clustering. Some PDZ domains form oligomers involving a PDZ ligand in one partner binding the groove in the other or, alternatively, a back-to-back association that is independent of the binding groove and therefore not a bona fide PDZ interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Xu et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Marfatia et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Im et al., 2003a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">b</xref>). To test the involvement of a bona fide PDZ interaction in GRASP65-mediated organelle tethering, the structure of the PDZ1 domain was computationally modeled, allowing us to identify and mutate the putative PDZ1 binding groove. Mutation at this site blocked mitochondrial clustering, confirming the specificity of the assay and strongly suggesting the novel involvement of a homotypic PDZ interaction in homotypic membrane tethering. Further, the same mutation blocked GRASP65-mediated Golgi ribbon formation, arguing that the structure/function analysis performed on the mitochondrial membrane recapitulates key aspects of Golgi membrane network formation and that GRASP65 acts as a homotypic organelle tether.</p><sec><title>Homotypic interactions underlie homotypic tethering</title><p>Golgi membranes form a network that is subcompartmentalized such that there is extensive continuity within a subcompartment and little continuity between subcompartments. The model that GRASP65 is the tether for fusion of cis Golgi membranes is appealing because a homotypic interaction mediates crossbridging of like membranes. This is conceptually analogous to homotypic mitofusin interactions in homotypic fusion of mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Koshiba et al., 2004</xref>). Because the GRASP65 interaction is a PDZ-ligand type interaction it raises the possibility that crossbridging is stabilized by reciprocal interactions in which each PDZ domain contributes a ligand that associates with the binding groove of the partner. Alternatively, a higher order set of interactions may take place in which a PDZ domain contributes a ligand to one partner and a binding groove to another. In either case, because it is homotypic, the interaction is likely to involve twofold symmetry. Our data also suggest that the interaction involves an internal PDZ ligand rather than a more typical C-terminally positioned ligand. Whereas the terminal carboxylic acid in a C-terminally positioned ligand is coordinated by a conserved GLGF motif in the PDZ domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Harris and Lim, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hung and Sheng, 2002</xref>), the C terminus is replaced by a sharp &#x003b2;-turn or loop structure in an internal ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brenman et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gee et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Christopherson et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Harris et al., 2001</xref>). This key structural feature can be highly degenerate in sequence, making identification difficult. The mechanism of homotypic membrane fusion at sites of contact formed by GRASP65 crossbridging remains to be determined, but it is noteworthy that GM130, which stabilizes GRASP65 on the Golgi membrane, interacts with the SNARE protein syntaxin-5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Diao et al., 2008</xref>), suggesting that this interaction may coordinate tethering with fusion.</p></sec><sec><title>Membrane contact may regulate GRASP65 interactions</title><p>Membrane recruitment and tethering activity of GRASP65 requires two contact points with the organellar membrane. The first contact is binding to the GM130 C terminus. GM130 is required for GRASP65 Golgi localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Puthenveedu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kodani and Sutterlin, 2008</xref>). Recruitment of endogenous GRASP65 by a mitochondrial GM130 C terminus was sufficient for mitochondrial clustering, and the same deletion of ten amino acids that disrupts GM130 function in Golgi ribbon formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Puthenveedu et al., 2006</xref>) blocked clustering activity. These amino acids are required for GM130 to bind GRASP65 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barr et al., 1998</xref>) and, as expected, in their absence GM130 failed to recruit GRASP65 to the mitochondrial outer membrane. Thus, the results support a model in which GM130 recruits GRASP65 to the Golgi membrane and the recruited GRASP65 is the active factor in tethering.</p><p>The second point of membrane contact is the myristoylated GRASP65 N terminus. Under normal circumstances, membrane targeting of GRASP65 requires myristoylation in conjunction with GM130 binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barr et al., 1998</xref>). The N-terminal myristic acid is immediately adjacent to the PDZ1 module. Mutation of the glycine residue that becomes myristoylated blocked G65-GFP-ActA&#x02013;mediated mitochondrial clustering, but this construct has its own membrane anchor and the myristoylation site was not needed for its stable membrane association. Thus, the requirement for myristoylation suggests that the N terminus must be imbedded in the membrane and, indeed, substituting a transmembrane domain restored tethering. It can be further argued that the myristic acid is not needed for proper folding or even for the homotypic interaction, per se, because nonmyristoylated GRASP65, purified after expression in bacteria, retains oligomerization activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wang et al., 2005</xref>). In the cellular context, however, membrane association may facilitate the interaction. One idea is that N-terminal anchoring positions the binding groove such that it faces the cytosol favoring trans-pairing over cis-pairing. Another possibility, not mutually exclusive, is that membrane association triggers a conformational change that activates GRASP65 for binding, thereby preventing soluble GRASP65 from inadvertently inhibiting the trans pairing interactions. In sum, these findings uncover a direct functional role, beyond membrane targeting, for anchoring the GRASP65 N terminus.</p></sec><sec><title>Functional divergence of GRASP isoforms may maintain subcompartment identity</title><p>Mammals and other vertebrates that form Golgi ribbon networks express two GRASP proteins. GRASP65 is principally localized to the cis Golgi, whereas GRASP55 is localized to medial and trans cisternae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shorter et al., 1999</xref>). In common with GRASP65, GRASP55 has a tandem arrangement of PDZ-like domains at its N terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shorter et al., 1999</xref>) and GRASP55 is required for Golgi ribbon formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Feinstein and Linstedt, 2008</xref>). Each protein interacts with itself but does not interact with the other GRASP (unpublished data), suggesting specificity-conferring differences in the PDZ1 domain of each molecule. Thus, it is likely that GRASP65 and GRASP55 act in parallel reactions with GRASP65 supporting membrane fusion to laterally link and elongate cis cisternae and GRASP55 doing the same for medial cisternae. From an evolutionary perspective, functional divergence of the GRASP PDZ domains after gene duplication may have been a necessary step to maintain Golgi subcompartments once microtubule-based motility brought Golgi ministacks into close proximity in the region of the microtubule organizing center. PDZ modules are well suited as divergence in the PDZ1 binding groove and ligand, and also in the interactions determining compartmental localization, would confer specificity such that lateral fusion within the membrane network is specific between cis and medial subcompartments.</p><p>GRASP65 and GRASP55 were initially characterized as requirements for stacking Golgi cisternae in an in vitro assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barr et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shorter et al., 1999</xref>). Subsequently, it was observed that Golgi stacks persist after effective GRASP knockdown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sutterlin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Puthenveedu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Feinstein and Linstedt, 2008</xref>). Although the mechanism elucidated here could also underlie cisternal stacking, this would place a homotypic interaction in a heterotypic membrane linkage. Further, we noted that the ultrastructure of the juxtaposed mitochondrial membranes linked by G65-GFP-ActA was distinct from the parallel less than 15 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mollenhauer and Morre, 1991</xref>) spacing present in Golgi stacks. Even so, given its ability to bridge membranes by self-association and the inherent slop in protein targeting, it is arguable that to some extent GRASP65 participates in linking cisternae, not just laterally, but also in a stacked configuration. A possible explanation for the predominant role of the GRASP proteins in lateral homotypic Golgi connections is that membrane insertion and orientation of PDZ1 might render its binding curvature sensitive such that ligand binding by PDZ1 is favored at the highly curved rim regions and disfavored at the relatively flat intra-cisternal contacts within a ministack. The enrichment of the GRASP65 binding partner GM130 at the rim regions of cis cisternae is consistent with this (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Marra et al., 2001</xref>). Intriguingly, the clustered mitochondria that we observed using electron microscopy exhibited regions of high and low curvature, and the closest points of contact were frequently present at zones of highest curvature.</p><p>In lower eukaryotes a single GRASP gene is present and Golgi membranes, even when present as stacked cisternae, are neither confined to a central position nor fused laterally to form a ribbon-like membrane network. Nevertheless, the yeast GRASP homologue possesses an acetylated N-terminal amphipathic helix adjacent to a PDZ-like domain, indicating conservation, via an alternative mechanism, of membrane anchoring, and suggesting a commonality in mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Behnia et al., 2007</xref>). Possibly, ribbon formation in vertebrates is a more extreme form of cisternal elongation performed by lower eukaryotes. If so, homotypic membrane tethering mediated by membrane-anchored PDZ1 could represent the fundamental mechanism of GRASP65 action. The physical distance separating cisternae or ministacks may contribute to prevention of lateral fusion which, given the presence of only a single GRASP, might otherwise impair maintenance of subcompartment identity. Recent observations indicate that the GRASP present in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> and <italic>Drosophila</italic> is required in developmentally specific steps involving nonconventional secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kinseth et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schotman et al., 2008</xref>). It is not yet clear whether this activity involves PDZ1-mediated membrane tethering.</p><p>In summary, our results indicate a direct role for GRASP65 in Golgi membrane network formation and, for the first time, identify a PDZ interaction as a membrane-tethering mechanism. Homotypic PDZ-mediated membrane crossbridging provides a compelling view of how subcompartments are maintained in the Golgi network and suggests modes of regulation that uncouple Golgi ministacks to promote mitotic entry and subsequent Golgi partitioning.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Constructs</title><p>For GFP-ActA, residues 599&#x02013;624 of the ActA protein from <italic>Listeria monocytogens</italic> were cloned into the HindIII and BamHI sites of pEGFP-C1 (Clontech Laboratories, Inc.).
