Here we show that the ability of human NK cells to produce interferon-&#x003b3; in response to stimulation by <named-content content-type="genus-species">Plasmodium falciparum</named-content>&#x02013;infected red blood cells (iRBCs) is strictly dependent upon multiple, contact-dependent and cytokine-mediated signals derived from both monocytes and myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs). Contrary to some previous reports, we find that both monocytes and mDCs express an activated phenotype following short-term incubation with iRBCs and secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines. The magnitude of the NK cell response (and of the KIR<sup>&#x02212;</sup> CD56<sup>bright</sup> NK cell population in particular) is tightly correlated with resting levels of accessory cell maturation, indicating that heterogeneity of the NK response to malaria is a reflection of deep-rooted heterogeneity in the human innate immune system. Moreover, we show that NK cells are required to maintain the maturation status of resting mDCs and monocytes, providing additional evidence for reciprocal regulation of NK cells and accessory cells. However, NK cell&#x02013;derived signals are not required for activation of accessory cells by either iRBCs or bacterial lipolysaccharide. Together, these data suggest that there may be differences in the sequence of events required for activation of NK cells by non-viral pathogens compared to the classical model of NK activation by virus-infected or major histocompatibility complex&#x02013;deficient cells. These findings have far-reaching implications for the study of immunity to infection in human populations.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="synopsis"><title>Synopsis</title><p>The outcome of infection is determined both by the ability to limit the initial phase of pathogen colonisation and by the ability to mount an effective adaptive immune response. Both of these processes are influenced by innate immune responses, of which a crucial component can be the ability of natural killer (NK) cells to secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines. Studies in both humans and mice indicate that the magnitude of the early (innate) interferon (IFN)&#x02013;&#x003b3; response is a crucial determinant of the outcome of malaria infection. In this study, Newman et al. show that activation of human NK cells by <named-content content-type="genus-species">Plasmodium falciparum</named-content>&#x02013;infected red blood cells to produce IFN-&#x003b3; is strictly dependent upon, and regulated by, contact-mediated and soluble (cytokine) signals from two accessory cell populations (myeloid dendritic cells and monocytes). Furthermore, the magnitude of the human NK cell IFN-&#x003b3; response to <named-content content-type="genus-species">P. falciparum</named-content>&#x02013;infected red blood cells is highly correlated with levels of expression of co-stimulatory molecules on resting accessory cells. These findings suggest that it might be possible to predict the magnitude of the innate cytokine response, and possibly even susceptibility to malarial disease, from the phenotype of resting monocytes. In addition, these data contribute to the development of a new model of NK activation by non-viral pathogens in which activation of accessory cells precedes, rather than follows, NK activation.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Newman KC, Korbel DS, Hafalla JC, Riley EM (2006) Cross-talk with myeloid accessory cells regulates human natural killer cell interferon-&#x003b3; responses to malaria.

We thus sought to determine whether such contact-dependent signals were also required for NK activation by iRBCs. Purified NK cells (in the upper chamber of a Transwell culture system) were separated from PBMCs (in the lower chamber) by a microporous membrane (0.4-&#x003bc;m diameter), which allowed diffusion of small molecules including cytokines, but not migration of leukocytes, iRBCs, or extracellular malarial merozoites.

When iRBCs were added to the lower chamber, NK cells within the PBMC population synthesised IFN-&#x003b3; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020118-g006">Figure 6</xref>A, PBMC control) and upregulated CD69 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020118-g006">Figure 6</xref>B, PBMC control). However, addition of iRBCs to the upper well, the lower well, or both the upper and lower wells together was insufficient to induce optimal IFN-&#x003b3; production among the NK cells in the upper well, suggesting that contact-mediated interactions between NK cells and iRBCs and/or between accessory cells and iRBCs are insufficient for full NK activation and that direct cell&#x02013;cell contact between the NK cells and the accessory cells is required.</p><p>Contact between NK cells and accessory cells was also required for optimal up-regulation of CD69, although partial up-regulation of CD69 was observed in some cases when purified NK cells were in contact with iRBCs and/or when accessory cells were in contact with iRBCs.

On the other hand, the degree of reciprocity between NK cells and monocytes, and the potential for NK cells to augment accessory cell responses to non-viral pathogens, has not to our knowledge been investigated.

For resting levels of CD40 expression there was again a much closer correlation with the IFN-&#x003b3; response of CD56<sup>bright</sup> NK cells than with that of CD56<sup>dim</sup> NK cells. One plausible interpretation of these data is that the NK cell IFN-&#x003b3; response is very sensitive to accessory cell CD40 expression and IL-12 production, but that in CD56<sup>dim</sup> cells this response is moderated by KIR/major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I&#x02013;mediated signals.</p><p>Our observation that TGF-&#x003b2; is able to markedly suppress NK cell IFN-&#x003b3; responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020118-g005">Figure 5</xref>) led us to consider whether the heterogeneity of NK cell responses was due to differential production and/or activation of TGF-&#x003b2;. There was no consistent increase or decrease in the concentration of bioactive TGF-&#x003b2; in the supernatants of iRBC-stimulated PBMCs; a modest increase in bioactive TGF-&#x003b2; concentration was observed for two donors, but these were, in fact, the donors with the highest NK cell IFN-&#x003b3; responses to iRBCs, suggesting that suppression by TGF-&#x003b2; does not explain the heterogeneity of NK cell IFN-&#x003b3; response. Rather, regulation of bioactive TGF-&#x003b2; appears to be positively correlated with NK cell IFN-&#x003b3; expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020118-g008">Figure 8</xref>E), and furthermore, the correlation with CD56<sup>dim</sup> NK cells was higher than that with CD56<sup>bright</sup> NK cells. This suggests that TGF-&#x003b2; is not causal in NK cell activation, but rather that the total amount of IFN-&#x003b3; produced determines the amount of TGF-&#x003b2;. Thus, activation may lead to induction of negative feedback mechanisms in order to prevent excessive pro-inflammatory responses.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>By carefully dissecting the requirements for activation of human NK cells by iRBCs, we have revealed that the early NK cell&#x02013;derived IFN-&#x003b3; response is absolutely dependent upon contact with, and cytokine production by, accessory cells. We have identified the requisite accessory cells as monocytes and mDCs and have shown that both cell types become highly activated during the first 24 h of exposure to iRBCs. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that whilst NK cells provide essential signals that maintain the maturation status of resting monocytes and mDCs, NK cells are not required for these same cells to respond fully to iRBCs. Finally, we have shown that the capacity of NK cells to secrete IFN-&#x003b3; is highly correlated with both the resting phenotype of the accessory cells and the concentration of iRBC-induced monokines. Thus, functional heterogeneity of monocytes and mDCs among human populations appears to play a crucial role in determining the magnitude of the innate immune response to iRBCs.</p><p>A wealth of evidence suggests that, after interaction with malarial parasites, both monocytes and mDCs secrete immunosuppressive cytokines and have an impaired ability to respond to a variety of stimulatory ligands &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020118-b013">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020118-b017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020118-b031">31</xref>&#x0005d;. These data have led some to conclude that monocyte and DC function is universally impaired by contact with malarial parasites and that this underlies an apparent suppression of immune responses seen during malaria infections. However, there have been several reports of activation of monocytes and DCs by <italic>Plasmodium</italic>-derived ligands &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020118-b032">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020118-b034">34</xref>&#x0005d;. Studies of rodent malaria infections have begun to resolve this debate, showing that in the first 24 h of infection, splenic DCs are activated, secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-12 and tumour necrosis factor-&#x003b1;, and present antigen to T cells, but that they subsequently become refractory to re-stimulation and secrete anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-10 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020118-b035">35</xref>&#x0005d;. This sequence of events allows infection to be controlled whilst simultaneously avoiding immune-mediated pathology &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020118-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d;. Here we show that human monocytes and mDCs are highly activated after 24 h of co-incubation with iRBCs. The myeloid cell response occurred in the presence or absence of NK cells, indicating that direct interaction with parasites&#x02014;as opposed to NK-derived IFN-&#x003b3;&#x02014;drives the initial activation of these cells. Furthermore, this activation initiates and regulates the crucial early burst of IFN-&#x003b3; from NK cells. However, our observation that NK activation goes hand in hand with IL-10 and TGF-&#x003b2; production, and that TGF-&#x003b2; can suppress NK IFN-&#x003b3; production, is consistent with the notion that pro-inflammatory responses to malaria are carefully regulated by homeostatic mechanisms to prevent immune-mediated pathology.</p><p>Our observations regarding the accessory cell requirements for NK cell activation by malaria parasites are in partial agreement with a previous report invoking a role for monocytes in this response &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020118-b036">36</xref>&#x0005d;; however, we show that mDCs play an equally important role. The fact that NK activation is suboptimal but not absent in the presence of only one or the other accessory cell population suggests that although there is some redundancy in their roles, they also provide complementary signals. Our data are consistent with reports of leukocyte activation by malarial glycosylphosphatidylinositol signalling through toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 and TLR4 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020118-b037">37</xref>&#x0005d;, which are both expressed on monocytes and mDCs but not pDCs &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020118-b038">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020118-b039">39</xref>&#x0005d;, although a role for other receptors cannot be ruled out. The reported activation of pDCs by a malarial hemozoin&#x02013;TLR9 pathway &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020118-b040">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020118-b041">41</xref>&#x0005d; does not appear to be required for NK IFN-&#x003b3; production, consistent with previous reports that NK cytotoxic activity but not IFN-&#x003b3; secretion is dependent on pDC-derived signals &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020118-b042">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020118-b043">43</xref>&#x0005d;. In fact, depletion of pDCs increased the IFN-&#x003b3; response of NK cells in two out of three donors, suggesting that pDCs may have a net anti-inflammatory effect in this system, perhaps mediated by either IL-10 or TGF-&#x003b2;. Further experiments are required to test this possibility.</p><p>The data presented here reveal that accessory cell&#x02013;dependent activation of NK cells by iRBCs is multifactorial and, as in other systems, involves multiple cytokines (IL-2, IL-12, IL-18, and IFN-&#x003b1;) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020118-b044">44</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020118-b046">46</xref>&#x0005d; as well as direct contact between NK cells and accessory cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020118-b012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020118-b022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020118-b026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020118-b027">27</xref>&#x0005d;.

Contact-dependent signals might include CD40&#x02013;CD40L signalling &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020118-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;, delivery of IL-12 from mDCs via an immune synapse &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020118-b048">48</xref>&#x0005d;, or binding of MHC&#x02013;peptide complexes by activating KIR &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020118-b049">49</xref>&#x0005d;. We believe that indirect, accessory cell&#x02013;mediated signals are likely to be the major mechanism of NK cell activation by iRBCs, but we cannot rule out that the NK cell receives additional signals via direct interaction with iRBCs. Stable contacts between iRBCs and NK cells have been reported by ourselves and by others &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020118-b009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020118-b036">36</xref>&#x0005d;, and we have observed reorganisation of the actin cytoskeleton at the point of iRBC&#x02013;NK contact &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020118-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;; the functional consequence of these interactions are, however, not yet fully understood.</p><p>Our observation that NK cells are not required for optimal activation of monocytes and mDCs by pathogen-derived ligands (iRBCs and LPS) runs somewhat counter to previous reports that NK cells augment DC maturation, cytokine secretion, and antigen presentation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020118-b028">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020118-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d;. One plausible explanation for this discrepancy is that the sequence of events leading to activation of NK cells and accessory cells depends on the nature of the stimulus. In the case of virally infected or neoplastic cells, altered expression of MHC or MHC-like ligands on the target cell will lead to direct activation of NK cells either through engagement of natural cytotoxicity receptors or changes in the balance of activating and inhibitory signals delivered by KIR receptors (reviewed in &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020118-b050">50</xref>&#x0005d;). In this case, amplification of the innate response and induction of adaptive immunity would be facilitated if NK cells were able to provide activating signals to DCs and other antigen-presenting cells, which are much less sensitive to changes in MHC expression. On the other hand, in the case of bacterial and protozoal pathogens, which do not grossly alter MHC class I expression or induce MHC-related stress ligands on host cells, direct activation of NK cells is unlikely. Rather, DCs and monocytes are likely to be directly activated by binding of pathogen-associated molecular patterns to TLRs and other pattern recognition receptors and may not require additional signals from NK cells.</p><p>Given the importance of the innate response to malaria in determining the outcome of disease (reviewed in &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020118-b001">1</xref>&#x0005d;), dissecting the basis for the heterogeneity of the human NK cell response to iRBCs could be crucial in understanding disease susceptibility. The close correlations shown here between accessory cell maturation, accessory cell responses to iRBCs, and induction of IFN-&#x003b3; production by NK cells suggest that heterogeneity of NK cell responses to iRBCs &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020118-b008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020118-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d; is a reflection of deeply rooted heterogeneity of innate responses within the human population. Ongoing studies of the immunogenetics of susceptibility to human malaria should begin to identify the underlying basis for this heterogeneity, but linking genotype to immunological phenotype may not be straightforward. Multiple genes, including various IFN regulatory factor proteins and components of the colony stimulating factor 1 signalling pathway, influence the maturation status of accessory cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020118-b051">51</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020118-b053">53</xref>&#x0005d;. Moreover, the much stronger correlation of accessory cell status with activation of CD56<sup>bright</sup> (KIR<sup>&#x02212;</sup>) NK cells than with activation of CD56<sup>dim</sup> (KIR<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>) NK cells suggests that NK cell activation by pathogen-induced accessory cell signals may be modulated by NK cell receptor expression. Since KIR genes, along with MHC genes, are some of the most highly polymorphic loci in the human genome &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020118-b054">54</xref>&#x0005d;, dissecting the genetic basis of diversity in the human innate response is a daunting task. Nevertheless, as CD56<sup>dim</sup> cells are the major population of NK cells in peripheral blood and spleen &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020118-b055">55</xref>&#x0005d;, our data suggest that NK cell receptor expression is likely to have a significant influence on overall NK cell responsiveness and thus potentially affect the severity of malarial disease and other systemic infections. Despite the difficulties associated with carrying them out, population-based studies of disease risk and diversity in innate response genes could have far-reaching implications, and we have recently begun such studies in malaria-endemic populations. Since the antigen-presenting and co-stimulatory functions of accessory cells are pivotal for induction of adaptive immunity, and the magnitude of the early IFN-&#x003b3; response affects adaptive responses &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020118-b056">56</xref>&#x0005d;, heterogeneity of expression of CD40, HLA-DR, and NK cell IFN-&#x003b3; is likely to have a profound impact on the generation of acquired immune responses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="ppat-0020118-sg001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><title>Depletion of HLA-DR-Positive Cells Does Not Affect the Ability of NK Cells to Produce IFN-&#x003b3; following Stimulation with IL-12 and IL-18</title><p>(A) Representative example of NK cell response to IL-12 and IL-18 when cultured in the context of whole PBMCs or PBMCs depleted of HLA-DR-positive cells.</p><p>(B) Data from five donors showing proportion of NK cells positive for intracellular IFN-&#x003b3; following stimulation with IL-12 and IL-18 in the context of whole PBMCs or PBMCs depleted of HLA-DR-positive cells.
