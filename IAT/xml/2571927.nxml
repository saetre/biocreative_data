Although the physiological ligands that interact with N1 expressed on thymic precursors are currently unknown, in vitro culture systems point to Delta-like 1 (DL1) and DL4 as prime candidates. Using <italic>DL1</italic>- and <italic>DL4-lacZ</italic> reporter knock-in mice and novel monoclonal antibodies to DL1 and DL4, we show that DL4 is expressed on thymic epithelial cells (TECs), whereas DL1 is not detected. The function of DL4 was further explored in vivo by generating mice in which <italic>DL4</italic> could be specifically inactivated in TECs or in hematopoietic progenitors. Although loss of DL4 in hematopoietic progenitors did not perturb thymus development, inactivation of <italic>DL4</italic> in TECs led to a complete block in T cell development coupled with the ectopic appearance of immature B cells in the thymus. These immature B cells were phenotypically indistinguishable from those developing in the thymus of conditional <italic>N1</italic> mutant mice. Collectively, our results demonstrate that DL4 is the essential and nonredundant N1 ligand responsible for T cell lineage commitment. Moreover, they strongly suggest that N1-expressing thymic progenitors interact with DL4-expressing TECs to suppress B lineage potential and to induce the first steps of intrathymic T cell development.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>The thymus is continuously seeded by progenitors derived from hematopoietic stem cells, which reside in the BM. These progenitors migrate via the blood stream into the thymus, where they adopt a T cell fate, proliferate, and differentiate into mature functional T cells. This differentiation process is characterized by multiple developmental stages. The earliest thymic progenitors lack surface expression of CD4 and CD8 and are therefore referred to as double-negative (DN) thymocytes. They subsequently up-regulate both CD4 and CD8 coreceptors (double positive [DP]) before undergoing positive and negative selection, and maturing to CD4 and CD8 single-positive (SP) thymocytes that emigrate to the periphery. Immature DN thymocytes can be subdivided into four subpopulations according to the surface expression of CD117, CD44, and CD25. The most immature thymocyte progenitors (DN1) express CD117 and CD44 and are negative for CD25, followed by the DN2 population, which up-regulates CD25, and the DN3 cells, which down-regulate CD117 and CD44 before generating DN4 thymocytes lacking expression of all three markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>).</p><p>Over the last decade, many reports highlighted the importance of the evolutionarily conserved Notch cascade for the lymphoid system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>). Mammals possess 4 Notch receptors (N1&#x02013;4), which are activated by two classes of transmembrane bound ligands named Jagged 1 and 2, and Delta-like (DL) 1, 3, and 4. Notch signaling is initiated upon ligand receptor interaction, which results in the proteolytic release of the Notch intracellular cytoplasmic domain (NICD) of Notch receptors. The liberated NICD translocates to the nucleus and binds to the transcription factor RBP-J (also known as CSL), thereby converting it from a transcriptional repressor into an activator. Mastermind-like proteins are required for Notch signaling, as they bind to the NICD&#x02013;RBP-J complex and recruit additional coactivators.</p><p>Multiple genetic loss- and gain-of-function experiments show that signaling mediated through the N1 receptor plays an important role for T cell lineage commitment and maturation within the thymus. Inducible inactivation of <italic>N1</italic> in BM progenitors results in a block in T cell development and ectopic B cell development in the thymus, suggesting that N1 instructs an early thymic progenitor to adopt a T cell fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>). An identical phenotype is observed in mice in which the <italic>RBP-J</italic> gene was inactivated in BM progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>), strongly indicating that T cell specification is mediated by N1&#x02013;RBP-J&#x02013;dependent signaling. Interference with Notch signaling by transgenic expression of modulators (such as <italic>Fringe</italic>, <italic>Deltex</italic>, or <italic>Nrarp</italic>) or dominant-negative forms of transcriptional coactivators (<italic>mastermind-like 1</italic>) also blocks T cell development concomitant with B lymphopoiesis in the thymus (for review see reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>). Reciprocal gain-of-function studies overexpressing NICD in BM progenitors result in ectopic T cell development at the expense of B cell development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>). Thus, both loss- and gain-of-function studies demonstrate that N1 is essential for T lineage commitment. In addition, N1&#x02013;RBP-J signaling promotes the differentiation of pro&#x02013;T cells into pre&#x02013;T cells within the thymus by controlling rearrangement of the TCR &#x003b2; locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>) through regulating chromatin accessibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>), thereby assuring the successful generation of a pre-TCR complex, which is essential for thymocyte development.</p><p>Although N1 is unequivocally the key Notch receptor involved in T lineage commitment and thymic T cell maturation in vivo, the ligands that could be the physiological partners of N1 in these processes are still a matter of debate. The thymic epithelial microenvironment expresses all <italic>Notch</italic> ligands (mainly assessed by RT-PCR), except <italic>DL3</italic>, which is hardly found in this organ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>). However, both Jagged ligands can be excluded from playing an essential role, as <italic>Jagged2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> and, more recently, <italic>Jagged1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice have been shown to have normal T cell development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>), thus implicating DL1 and/or DL4 ligands. Historically, DL1 has been favored as the potential N1 ligand in T cell fate specification, because DL1-expressing stromal cells can support the complete development of mature functional T cells from BM precursors in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>). Moreover, when BM progenitors are co-cultured on stromal cells overexpressing DL1, B cell development is blocked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>). Surprisingly, in contrast with these promising data obtained in vitro, conditional inactivation of <italic>DL1</italic> in thymocytes and/or thymic epithelial cells (TECs) does not inhibit T cell development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>). This discrepancy may be caused by the in vivo presence of DL4, which shares a high degree of homology with DL1. Data obtained in vitro support this hypothesis, because overexpression of DL4 in stromal cells can also direct T lymphopoiesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>). In addition, overexpression of DL4 in BM precursors transferred into &#x003b3;-irradiated mice leads to ectopic T cell development in the BM as well as a severe defect in B cell development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>). Moreover, we recently described a hierarchy of Notch&#x02013;Delta interactions showing that the avidity of DL4 to bind to immature thymocytes is much higher than that of DL1. DL4 binding is high from the DN1 to DN3 stages and declines in DN4 to become undetectable in subsequent DP and SP thymocytes. This binding pattern parallels the functional requirements of Notch signaling during thymocyte development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>), suggesting that DL4 might play an important role during T cell development within the thymus.</p><p>In this report, we explore the function of DL4 within the thymus using a conditional loss-of-function approach. Our data show that <italic>Foxn1-Cre</italic>&#x02013;mediated inactivation of <italic>DL4</italic> within the thymic epithelium leads to a complete block in T cell development accompanied by ectopic B cell development within the thymus, which phenocopies mice with inducible inactivation of <italic>N1</italic> in BM progenitors. Thus, DL4 is essential for T cell fate specification and thereby represents the physiological partner of N1 during this process.</p><sec><title>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</title><p>Because DL1- and DL4-expressing OP-9 stromal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>) or normal thymic stroma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>) can both support the complete development of mature functional T cells from BM precursors in vitro, it is conceivable that either or both of these proteins function as physiological ligands for the N1 receptor during thymic T cell lineage commitment. To gain further insight into the expression pattern of <italic>DL1</italic> and <italic>DL4</italic> in the thymus, we analyzed thymi of mice in which the <italic>lacZ</italic> gene was knocked into either the <italic>DL1</italic> or <italic>DL4</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>). LacZ staining on thymic sections derived from <italic>DL1<sup>lacZ/</sup></italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> mice was only positive for rare endothelial cells within the thymus, whereas <italic>DL4<sup>LacZ/</sup></italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> mice exhibited a strong reticular expression pattern within the outer cortex (characteristic of epithelial cells) and a weaker more punctuated staining within the medulla of the thymus (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). This expression pattern was confirmed at the protein level using novel mAbs generated against the extracellular domains of DL1 and DL4. The specificity of the anti-DL1 and -DL4 mAbs was tested on DL1- and DL4-expressing OP-9 cells. Anti-DL1 mAbs bound specifically to DL1- but not to DL4-expressing OP-9 cells, whereas the anti-DL4 mAbs showed a reciprocal binding pattern (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). These results indicate that both mAbs specifically bind to the corresponding Notch ligands and that they do not exhibit any cross-reactivity. These mAbs were then used to stain cell preparations enriched for TECs and analyzed by flow cytometry. TECs were identified as CD45<sup>&#x02212;</sup>PanCytokeratin (PanCyt)<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>) and were further subdivided into cortical TECs (cTECs) and medullary TECs (mTECs) based on BP1 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>). Anti-DL1 mAbs did not stain cTECs or mTECs above background. In contrast anti-DL4 mAbs showed significant staining of TECs, with brighter staining for cortical- (BP1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>) versus medullary- (BP1<sup>&#x02212;</sup>) derived populations (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>). Analysis of thymocyte subpopulations for the expression of DL1 and DL4 with these mAbs was negative (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>). These expression data are in general agreement with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>), with the notable exception of one report in which TECs were broadly stained by a commercial polyclonal antibody against DL1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>). The specificity of this polyclonal reagent has already been challenged by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>). In conclusion, the thymic expression pattern of DL1 and DL4 revealed by our novel mAbs confirms the results obtained with the lacZ knock-in mice, strongly suggesting that DL4 might be the physiological ligand expressed by TECs that interacts with N1-expressing T cell precursors to specify the T cell lineage.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>DL4 but not DL1 expression is detected on TECs.</bold> (A) LacZ staining on thymic sections derived from <italic>DL1</italic> and <italic>DL4</italic> lacZ knock-in mice. mRNA expression of the <italic>DL1</italic>-driven lacZ gene is confined to blood vessels within the thymus, whereas <italic>DL4</italic> drives expression preferentially within the cortical epithelium.

In conclusion, the immature B cell phenotype observed in the thymi of <italic>N1<sup>&#x00394;Mx</sup></italic> mice is largely recapitulated in <italic>DL4<sup>&#x00394;Foxn1</sup></italic> mice, strongly suggesting that DL4 is the natural ligand for N1 during thymic T cell lineage commitment.</p><fig position="float" id="fig4"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p><bold>Comparative phenotypic analysis of B cells within thymi of <italic>DL4<sup>&#x00394;Foxn1</sup></italic> and <italic>N1<sup>&#x00394;Mx</sup></italic> mice.</bold> (A) Representative flow cytometric analysis of B cells in the DN thymus compartment from <italic>Ctrl</italic>, <italic>N1<sup>&#x00394;Mx</sup></italic>, and <italic>DL4<sup>&#x00394;Foxn1</sup></italic> mice stained for B220 and IgM (top) or BP1 and CD93 (bottom).

This quantitative difference between <italic>DL4<sup>&#x00394;Foxn1</sup></italic> and <italic>N1<sup>&#x00394;Mx</sup></italic> mice most likely reflects the consequence of inactivation of the floxed <italic>DL4</italic> and <italic>N1</italic> genes using two different Cre systems. The <italic>Mx-Cre</italic> transgene inducibly inactivates floxed genes preferentially in hematopoietic cells in the BM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>). Thus, postnatal inactivation of <italic>N1</italic> will generate N1-deficient BM progenitors that will migrate to the thymus and develop into B cells that will have to compete with residual thymocytes for the availability of thymic niches, growth factors, and cytokines. In contrast, constitutive <italic>Foxn1-Cre</italic>&#x02013;mediated <italic>DL4</italic> gene inactivation in TECs occurs already during embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>). Thus, the first wave of incoming lymphoid progenitors will encounter an empty DL4-deficient thymic epithelium. Although these precursors cannot be instructed toward the T cell lineage, they can develop into the B cell lineage and efficiently expand in the absence of competition, as all necessary cytokines and growth factors are abundantly present in the neonatal thymus.</p><p>Although <italic>Foxn1-Cre</italic> expression within the thymus should be restricted to TECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>) and wild-type thymocytes do not stain detectably with anti-DL4 mAbs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>), it remains formally possible that rare DL4-expressing hematopoietic cells might be involved in T cell lineage commitment in the thymus. In this scenario, loss of DL4 expression on these cells could theoretically contribute to the generation of immature B cells in the <italic>DL4<sup>&#x00394;Foxn1</sup></italic> thymus. To exclude this possibility, we generated <italic>DL4<sup>lox/loxMx-Cre</sup></italic> (<italic>DL4<sup>&#x00394;Mx</sup></italic>) mice to inducibly inactivate <italic>DL4</italic> in BM progenitors. Because the <italic>Mx-Cre</italic> transgene is also active to some extent in TECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>), BM from <italic>DL4<sup>&#x00394;Mx</sup></italic> or <italic>Ctrl</italic> mice (both CD45.2<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>) was transplanted into CD45.1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> wild-type hosts to critically evaluate whether <italic>DL4<sup>&#x00394;Mx</sup></italic> hematopoietic cells could contribute to the phenotype. <italic>Ctrl</italic> and <italic>DL4<sup>&#x00394;Mx</sup></italic> BM chimeras were analyzed 8 wk after transplantation. The reconstitution efficiency of CD45.2<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells for both <italic>Ctrl</italic> and <italic>DL4<sup>&#x00394;Mx</sup></italic> chimeras was &#x0003e;95%. A portion of the BM cells of the corresponding BM chimeras was analyzed by Southern blot analysis to ensure that reconstitution was not caused by rare cells that might have escaped deletion of the DL4 locus (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 E</xref>). As expected, <italic>Ctrl</italic> and <italic>DL4<sup>&#x00394;Mx</sup></italic> BM progenitors generated all major blood lineages in the BM and spleen (unpublished data).

Moreover, <italic>DL4<sup>&#x00394;Foxn1</sup></italic> mice exhibit a loss of DL4 expression in TECs, which correlates with a complete block in T cell development and the accumulation of immature B cells within the thymus. DL4 deficiency within hematopoietic progenitors seems not to contribute to this phenotype, as assessed by BM chimeras, suggesting that the loss of DL4 on TECs is causative. A similar accumulation of immature thymic B cells is found in mice in which the <italic>N1</italic> receptor is inactivated in hematopoietic progenitors. Collectively, these data demonstrate that DL4 expression on TECs is essential for thymic T cell development. Furthermore, they strongly suggest that N1-expressing T cell progenitors only commit to the T cell lineage after entry into the thymus.</p><p>Although in vitro DL1 and DL4 are functionally redundant in their ability to promote T cell development from BM precursors when expressed on OP9 cells, in vivo DL1 and DL4 mediate nonredundant functions within the hematopoietic system by binding to specific Notch receptors. Our data demonstrate that DL4 and N1 constitute within the thymus a nonredundant ligand&#x02013;receptor pair essential for T cell lineage commitment. Similarly, DL1 pairs with N2 in the spleen to specify marginal zone B cell development in a nonredundant manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>). Differential expression of Notch ligands has also been reported to influence T helper cell differentiation in peripheral CD4 T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>). Thus, all of these examples are consistent with the possibility that specificity of Notch signaling within the hematopoietic system might be generally regulated by tissue-specific expression of Notch ligands.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>Mice: generation of DL4 gene-targeted floxed mice.</title><p>We generated the conditional <italic>Dl4</italic> loss-of-function mutant mice by flanking the first three exons of the <italic>DL4</italic> allele with two loxP sites.
