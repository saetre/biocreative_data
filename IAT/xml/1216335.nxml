Demonstrations include determination of the specificity of the cleavage sites at positions C<sup>27</sup> and U<sup>33</sup> in the first (5&#x02032;) motif and G<sup>439</sup> in the second (3&#x02032;) motif, complete competition inhibition of 5&#x02032; and 3&#x02032; HCV RNA cleavages by added double-stranded RNA in a 1:6 to 1:8 weight ratio, respectively, 50% reverse competition inhibition of the RNase III T7 R1.1 mRNA substrate cleavage by HCV RNA at 1:1 molar ratio, and determination of the 5&#x02032; phosphate and 3&#x02032; hydroxyl end groups of the newly generated termini after cleavage. By comparing the activity and specificity of the commercial RNase III enzyme, used in this study, with the natural <italic>E.coli</italic> RNase III enzyme, on the natural bacteriophage T7 R1.1 mRNA substrate, we demonstrated that the HCV cuts fall into the category of specific, secondary RNase III cleavages. This reaction identifies regions of unusual RNA structure, and we further showed that blocking or deletion of one of the two RNase III-sensitive sequence motifs impeded cleavage at the other, providing direct evidence that both sequence motifs, besides being far apart in the linear RNA sequence, occur in a single RNA structural motif, which encloses the HCV internal ribosome entry site in a large RNA loop.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a human pathogen causing chronic liver disease in 170 million people worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>). The virus is classified within the family <italic>flaviviridae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>). The RNA genome begins with a 5&#x02032;-untranslated region (5&#x02032;-UTR) that extends from position 1 to the AUG at position 342, continues in the core (C) coding region which is the first coding locus of a long open reading frame and ends in a 3&#x02032; non-coding region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>). The secondary structure of the 5&#x02032;-UTR of HCV has been extensively studied since the early nineties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>). Biochemical and functional studies revealed that the HCV 5&#x02032;-UTR folds into a highly ordered complex structure with multiple stem loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>) containing two distinct RNA elements, a short 5&#x02032;-proximal RNA element (nucleotides 1&#x02013;43) that regulates HCV replication and translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>) (domain I) and a longer internal ribosome entry site (IRES) element, including nucleotides 44&#x02013;370 and forming domains II, III and IV. Mutational analysis has revealed that maintenance of the IRES structural domains is critical for cap-independent initiation of translation of the viral polyprotein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>).</p><p>Comparison of HCV 5&#x02032;-UTR sequences from different HCV genotypes has revealed that variation is very limited to particular sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>). The sites of genotype variability are usually covariant substitution sites and they maintain the base paring required for the 5&#x02032;-UTR secondary structure model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). There is an interesting exception reported by Honda <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>) in an apparently unpaired region, between positions 21 and 43 where bases A<sup>34</sup> G<sup>35</sup> in genotype 1b correspond to G<sup>34</sup> A<sup>35</sup> in genotype 1a. The presence of A<sup>34</sup> G<sup>35</sup> has been associated with a 2-fold decrease of the translational efficiency in genotype 1b. This difference was only observed when the translated fragment contained the region downstream the AUG codon, supporting the idea of a long distance RNA&#x02013;RNA interaction between the region containing the AG dinucleotide preceding the IRES and the capsid coding region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>). Subsequently, it was observed that mutations introduced to decrease hypothetical Watson&#x02013;Crick base pairing between bases 24&#x02013;38 and 428&#x02013;442 could affect levels of IRES-mediated translation, and that compensatory mutations in this complementary motif re-established normal levels of translation directed by HCV IRES (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>). Kim <italic>et al</italic>. proposed a hypothetical double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) motif whose duplex stability could regulate IRES activity. Nevertheless, direct structural proof for these kinds of proposals, derived from the evolutionary and sequence correlations, is lacking.</p><p>RNase III was discovered in 1967 as the third RNase activity of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). It was defined as a specific dsRNase that cleaved regions of 20 or more base pairs of RNA&#x02013;RNA duplex structure and shown to participate in several RNA processes, including maturation of rRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>). RNase III may also cleave certain other specific regions with less perfect base pairings, which invariably contain approximately two turns of more or less regular dsRNA and additional sequence or structural elements which determine the way these substrates are cleaved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>). A well-studied example is the processing of the early mRNA region of the bacteriophage T7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). A set of specific cleavage reactions carried by <italic>E.coli</italic> RNase III enzyme which are favored at high enzyme:substrate ratios and at lower, rather than higher, monovalent cation concentration was discovered in 1976 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). These were referred to as secondary cleavages; they behave like primary cleavages in the following way: they are effectively inhibited by dsRNA competitors for RNase III primary cuts; they are not inhibited by large molar excess of ssRNA and they are reproducible and specific, yielding 5&#x02032; phosphates and 3&#x02032; hydroxyls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). In two well-characterized RNase III substrates, the T7 1.1mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>) (between genes 1.0 and 1.1 of T7 early region) and a region next to T7 1.2 mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>), primary and secondary cleavages occur in the opposite side of a hairpin loop &#x0223c;20 bp long, in a central region where the base pairing is less regular. Some secondary cleavages, such as that of R1.2 T7 mRNA, take place <italic>in vivo</italic>, although only 40% of the time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>).</p><p>Here, we found that two linked RNase III secondary cleavage sites flank the HCV IRES of genotype 1b. We also report that the two cleavages are specific to <italic>E.coli</italic> RNase III and show where the cleavages occur and the category into which they fall. Special caution was exercised because of using a commercial RNase III preparation that arises from cleavage of fusion proteins, to ensure that HCV cleavages are not the result of accompanying RNases or an artificial broadening of RNase III specificity. Finally, we report that the sequences carrying both cleavage sites interact to construct a single RNase III signal. This provides a direct proof for the presence of a structural motif with dsRNA characteristics between a region immediately preceding the IRES around positions C<sup>27</sup> and U<sup>33</sup> and a complementary downstream sequence surrounding positions G<sup>439</sup>.</p><p>Taken together, the sensitivity of HCV RNA to RNase III described here represents the structural correlate of previous functional studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>) and evolutionary observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>) that allow us to conclude that the HCV IRES is embedded in a larger RNA structure.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>RNase III enzyme</title><p>RNase III enzymes were obtained from commercial or natural sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>).

Natural RNase III enzyme was obtained from a phosphocellulose column peak or from a DEAE&#x02013;Sephadex column peak and was used to evaluate the specificity of the commercial Ambion enzyme under our reaction conditions.</p></sec><sec><title>RNA transcripts</title><p>The DNA templates for HCV RNA transcripts were derived from the plasmid vector pN (1&#x02013;4728) Bluescript, which contains nt 1&#x02013;4728 of HCV under the T7 promoter.

The commercial RNase III used in this study arises by cleavage of fusion protein and is purified through various steps with a focus on dsRNA cleavage, rather than the processing of long ssRNA with a few specific sites for cleavage. This leaves open the possibility of contamination by traces of conventional RNases, which can cleave ssRNA, or that the recombinant enzyme had acquired a subtly broadened specificity. In order to determine the specificity of HCV cleavages by RNase III in this work, two series of experiments were performed: one on the HCV RNA&#x02013;RNase III reaction and its cleavage products (classified as direct and indirect methods, respectively); the other comparing the action of commercial RNase III preparations and natural <italic>E.coli</italic> RNase III enzyme purified by standard techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>) on the well-known RNAse III substrate, bacteriophage T7 R1.1 mRNA.</p></sec><sec><title>Direct method: end group determination and cleavage precision by RNA sequencing</title><sec><title>Specific cleavage positions</title><p>If RNase III is responsible for HCV RNA cleavage and if it were to cleave HCV RNA with the same specificity as it does other substrates, the site of cleavage should be between precise nucleotide positions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Cleavage site within the first (5&#x02032;) domain</title><p>Non-radioactive (cold) S<sub>1</sub> was 5&#x02032; end-labeled with [&#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P]GTP in the presence of guanylyl transferase and purified by gel electrophoresis.

In relation to the mobility of the OH<sup>&#x02212;</sup> and P1 partial products (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, lanes 3 and 4, respectively), and counting from the first band, it was possible to conclude that RNase III is cleaving the phosphosdiester bond of a percentage of S<sub>1</sub> molecules between bases C<sup>27</sup> and C<sup>28</sup> and the rest between bases U<sup>33</sup> and A<sup>34</sup>.

The pattern of cleavage of the duplex at sites 27/439 differs from the general pattern of cleavage of a regular dsRNA at a given target site. Nevertheless, in cases where secondary RNAse III cleavage sites have been mapped, as in the R1.1 and R1.3 T7 RNA substrates, cleavages may produce a variety of extremes.</p></sec><sec><title>Biochemical characterization</title><p>One of the distinctive properties of RNase III is that it releases cleavage products containing 5&#x02032; PO<sub>4</sub> and 3&#x02032;OH end groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>). Contaminating RNases almost invariably cleave to yield 5&#x02032; hydroxyl and 2&#x02032;, 3&#x02032; phosphate end groups, and very few RNases cleave the phosphodiester backbone through the same mechanism used by RNase III (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>). To identify the end group of the reaction products we carried out two different kinds of experiments. One was an enzymatic approach; the other, based on electrophoretic mobility.</p></sec><sec><title>Enzymatic approach</title><p>T4 RNA ligase may add a [&#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P]pCp nucleotide to the 3&#x02032; OH end of an RNA fragment, and also may circularize terminal RNA fragments ending with a 5&#x02032; P and a 3&#x02032; OH. On the other hand, T4 polynucleotide kinase can introduce a <sup>32</sup>P from [&#x003b3;-<sup>32</sup>P]ATP into the 5&#x02032; end of an RNA fragment only if that end already has a 5&#x02032; OH, or has been previously dephosphorylated by treatment with a phosphatase. From all total and partial cleavage products generated after RNase III cleavage of S<sub>1</sub>, P2 has the two newly generated termini. Thus, efforts were first concentrated on the determination of the end groups of P2. Thus, S<sub>1</sub> was labeled at low specific radioactivity (enough to trace its electrophoretic mobility but low enough to permit an increase of incorporated radioactivity in the subsequent end-labeling reactions with the RNA ligase or polynucleotide kinase). Product band P2 was purified from other S<sub>1</sub> cleavage products after electrophoresis, and the recovered radioactivity was divided into three aliquots. The resulting RNA was proven to be (i) actively labeled at its 3&#x02032; end by T4 RNA ligase and [&#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P]pCp, as shown by an increase in the label in the autoradiogram in the lane representing the starting material (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, lane 2) as compared with that subsequently treated by the ligase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, lane 1), demonstrating a 3&#x02032; OH end; (ii) labeled in the 5&#x02032; end with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [&#x003b3;-<sup>32</sup>P]ATP preferentially when it was previously dephosphorylated by treatment with alkaline phosphatase enzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, lane 1) compared with when it was not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, lane 2), demonstrating the presence of a phosphate group in its 5&#x02032; end; (iii) circularized when incubated with T4 RNA ligase. In the electrophoresis autoradiogram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), it was possible to observe a more slowly migrating band (lane 2) in relation to untreated material (lane 1) that corresponds to circularized P2, proving in a single reaction the specific chemistry of RNase III reflected in both end groups at once.</p><p>The end-labeling or circularizing experiments described above were also performed on total and partial digestion fragments of S<sub>1</sub> (data not shown) proving the appropriate chemical groups: specifically, RNA ligase was able to label the 3&#x02032; end of P1, P2 and P1&#x02013;P2. Dephosphorylation-dependent kinasing was demonstrated in P2 and P2&#x02013;P3. Circularization was also demonstrated in P2&#x02013;P3, but failed as expected in P1&#x02013;P2, because of the presence of a 5&#x02032; pppG in P1 (pppG is not a substrate for RNA ligase).</p></sec><sec><title>Electrophoretic mobility</title><p>This second approach was based on the different electrophoretic motilities of RNA molecules depending on the nature of the chemical end group.

Electrophoretic mobility of the products from P1 digestion labeled at their 5&#x02032; ends were compared, in sequencing gels, with the mobility of a product ladder generated by partial digestion of S<sub>1</sub> substrate with alkali or with P1 nuclease.

Because a secondary cleavage site has also been described in T7 R1.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>) we wanted to distinguish if, with the Ambion enzyme preparation and in our salt conditions, we were dealing with the reported secondary RNase III cleavage type, on the one hand; or an ssRNase-specific contaminant in the commercial RNase III preparation or peculiar behavior of the commercial RNase III preparation, on the other hand.</p><p>A series of experiments were performed to distinguish among these alternatives. We used the T7 R1.1 RNA substrate to characterize (i) the activity of the recombinant enzyme from Ambion, as well as RNase III preparations from two other companies, in buffer conditions of the standard RNase III reaction and in comparison with natural <italic>E.coli</italic> enzyme; (ii) the activity of the Ambion enzyme on R1.1 RNA substrate in the buffer and salt conditions used in this paper, taking also as reference the authentic RNase III preparation; and (iii) the secondary cleavage site of the Ambion enzyme in R1.1. <list list-type="roman-lower"><list-item><p>Enzymes from Ambion, Epicenter, New England Biolabs and the natural <italic>E.coli</italic> RNase III were tested against the R1.1 substrate, transcribed in the presence of [&#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P]GTP.

The different pattern was probably due to the fact that the natural RNase III preparations had much lower concentrations than the commercial preparations. This explanation was also supported by the effect of 2 &#x000b5;g of poly(I&#x02013;C) dsRNA competitive inhibitor on the reactions, which drastically decreased the activity of the natural enzyme preparation while only slightly affecting the reactions of the much more concentrated commercial enzyme preparations (data not shown). Because the four bands appeared with the authentic RNase III purified without protein fusion techniques in reactions carried out under high salt conditions, because they arise in the presence of excess ssRNA and because their production is inhibited by dsRNA competitor, we can use these results to validate the specificity of commercial enzyme with respect to the natural enzyme.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Several changes were made in the reaction conditions to confirm the hypothesis of specific secondary RNase III cleavage in R1.1 RNA. First, Ambion RNase III was used at dilution 1/10 and 1/100, and was compared with the authentic RNase III (DEAE&#x02013;sephadex column peak); second, increasing amounts of competitor were used; and third, the high salt buffer conditions were replaced by the buffer and salt conditions used in this work, involving lower monovalent salt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, 0.05 M versus 0.13 M).

It is clear that in lane 5, the control reaction with no dsRNA, bands C and D are obviously present; they then disappear as the dsRNA concentration is raised in lanes 4&#x02013;2.

If both cleavage sites participate in a single RNA motif with double-stranded characteristics, deletion of one of the two complementary sequences should also prevent cleavage in the other. We prepared S<sub>3</sub> substrate, which spanned bases 1&#x02013;402 and lacked the sequence that comprises 3&#x02032; the cleavable site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). After RNase III incubation, a set of very faint bands migrating closely together and below the S<sub>3</sub> substrate appeared in the gel electrophoresis, but the appearance of these bands is not RNase III dependent as their presence was not affected by incubation with dsRNA. In addition, this 402-base substrate was unable to compete with T7 R.1.1 RNA cleavage by RNase III (data not shown). Thus, S<sub>3</sub> substrate has lost the RNA structure that provides sensitivity to RNase III at the 5&#x02032;-proximal site.</p><p>In a second type experiment, a ribo-oligonucleotide complementary to positions 23&#x02013;43 (5&#x02032;-rGGAGUCAUGUAUGGCGGAGUC-3&#x02032;), within which the 5&#x02032; cleavage site is located, was hybridized in excess concentration (15 nM) to block the hypothetical downstream Watson&#x02013;Crick binding region in HCV RNA substrates (0.6 nM) containing the 3&#x02032; end cleavage site. S<sub>1</sub> substrate was pre-heated in the absence or presence of the ribo-oligonucleotide, buffer added, and the reactions cooled to 37&#x000b0;C, when the RNase III enzyme was added.

In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, it may be observed that in the presence (+) of the complementary ribo-oligonucleotide the band pattern of the products changed with respect to those incubated without the ribo-oligonucleotide (&#x02212;). Specifically, a different pattern appeared, consistent with RNase III cleavage directed solely by the ribo-oligonucleotide. This proved that blocking the 5&#x02032; sequence motif impedes the formation of the RNA structure required for cleavage at the 3&#x02032; end. Together, the two experiments represent direct proof of the interaction between sequences containing both cleavages, enclosing the HCV IRES (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Here, we have provided evidence that RNase III from <italic>E.coli</italic> cleaves specifically and with high efficiency at sites within two sequence domains in the HCV IRES, which we have mapped to one region containing bases 27 and 33, and another region containing base 439 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). The first region is immediately upstream from the HCV IRES domain, while the other is &#x0223c;70 bases downstream [assuming that the IRES includes 30 nt of sequence downstream from the AUG start codon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>)]. Furthermore, we have confirmed by end group determination and substrate competition experiments that both natural and commercial RNase III preparations carry out this reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>). In addition, we have shown by several criteria that these HCV cleavages by RNase III fall into the category of specific secondary cleavages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p>Because cleavage within one RNase III-sensitive region of HCV requires coordinated cleavage within the other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), we propose that the two widely separated sequence elements which comprise them in fact form a base-paired structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), which is present at sufficient frequency to allow over 80% of the substrate to undergo RNase III cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). This conclusion is supported by the fact that 5&#x02032;-proximal RNase III cleavage fails to occur in the absence of the 3&#x02032;-proximal sequence (data not shown), and 3&#x02032; cleavage is blocked when the 5&#x02032; cleavable region is hybridized to a complementary RNA oligonucleotide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). We will briefly address how these findings relate to other RNase III-specific reactions; how the structured element identified here relates to previously identified HCV IRES structures and how a dsRNA structure bracketing the IRES might affect HCV gene expression.</p><p><italic>E.coli</italic> RNase III carries out three principal reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>): the digestion of perfect dsRNA to 15 bp fragments, independent of sequence; primary cleavage, usually of imperfectly base-paired regions which have evolved to play a role in host rRNA processing; and secondary cleavage, in which imperfectly base-paired regions from other RNAs, which resemble primary RNase III sites, are cleaved. While both dsRNA digestion and primary cleavage by RNase III are optimized in higher (&#x0003e;0.1 M monovalent cation) salt and lower enzyme:substrate conditions, secondary cleavage is favored at lower salt and higher enzyme:substrate ratios.</p><p>Cleavage sites sensitive to RNase III under low salt conditions, such as the ones described here in HCV RNA, have been reported in earlier studies on RNase III. In particular, RNase III cleavage of the genomic RNAs of several eukaryotic RNA viruses, including poliovirus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>), adenovirus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>) and vesicular stomatitis virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>), as well as mammalian rRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>), have been reported. However, these earlier findings neither did lead to a general explanation for the presence of such RNase III sites, nor did they give rise to further research, in contrast to the situation with prokaryotic RNase III sites. This lack of follow-up probably took place because mammalian RNase III-like enzymes had not yet been discovered; and because the earlier eukaryotic RNase III signals were not mapped to the base their exact RNA structure could not be ascertained.</p><p>Previously identified RNA structural elements in the HCV IRES include a pseudoknot just upstream from the AUG initiator codon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>), a UV-crosslinkable tertiary element in stem&#x02013;loop II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>), two E-loop structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>), one in the upper part of stem&#x02013;loop II and the other in stem&#x02013;loop IIId, a domain which undergoes UV-activated self-cleavage near the top of stem&#x02013;loop II (A. J. Lyons and H. D. Robertson, manuscript submitted) and a tRNA-like element near the AUG start codon recognized by human RNase P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>). While functions have been suggested for some of these elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>) others still await assignment. The presence of such elements in the near vicinity of a structural domain capable of undergoing RNase III cleavage requires further consideration.</p><p>First, there are a growing number of similarities between the HCV IRES and the adjacent core protein coding sequence, especially the first 1/3 thereof. Our data show that an RNAse III-sensitive structure converts the 5&#x02032;-UTR and 1/3 of the core-coding region into a circular RNA loop, closed by base pairing as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>. The IRES and core-coding regions, in addition to sharing a highly structured character (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>), overlap in several other ways. First, the IRES contains the first 30 bases of the core-coding sequence. Second, sequences required for HCV IRES cleavage by human RNase P may include bases at or near the IRES/core-coding junction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>). In addition, the IRES and core-coding regions share a low degree of sequence variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>). Together, these findings suggest that the two domains in this part of the HCV genome may have a structural and evolutionary unity, despite the coding/non-coding discontinuity, an idea which is strengthened by our finding that each domain contributes one of the two required elements which form the RNase III-sensitive structure whose discovery we report here.</p><p>The circular RNA of the hepatitis delta virus (HDV) is also an RNA circle (closed covalently rather by hydrogen bonds) which contains highly structured non-coding and coding regions that are adjacent to each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>). Furthermore, the &#x02018;delta antigen&#x02019; protein, encoded by HDV RNA, is a nucleic acid binding protein like the HCV core protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>). Both HDV and the HCV IRES region also contain a motif highly sensitive to UV irradiation in their non-coding regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>). Both HCV and HDV also infect the liver to provoke consistent infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>) and could reflect the evolution of a common unit of RNA expression pathogenic to the human liver.</p><p>The HCV RNase III signal maps within 79 and 130 bases of a previously described RNase P signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>). With regard to the presence of tRNA-like structure which stimulates RNase P cleavage in the near vicinity of RNase III cleavage sites, there are several noteworthy examples where these two kinds of signals appear close together, including the <italic>E.coli</italic> rRNA precursor molecule, the 10sa RNA molecule, and the mRNA of several bacteriophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>) and in structural RNAs in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>). The significance to <italic>in vivo</italic> function of both of these signal types remains to be established for HCV, although in the other cases mentioned both types participate in a common RNA processing pathway.</p><p>The presence of a structural element flanking the HCV IRES raises questions about how it may affect IRES activity. The most direct role would be in regulating the access of ribosomes to the IRES start signal. In their study of phylogenetic and mutational data favoring some type of interaction between HCV bases 24&#x02013;38 and 428&#x02013;442, Kim <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>) suggested that such an element might inhibit translation. Further studies will be required to measure the ability of IRES-specific components (initiation factors, ribosomal subunits, RNase P) to bind HCV RNA with versus without the RNase III-sensitive structure. It is interesting to note, in this regard, that the vast majority of studies on translation stimulated by the HCV IRES, both <italic>in vitro</italic> and in cells and using either mono- or di-cistronic constructs, have used HCV IRES sequences spanning only bases 1&#x02013;400, lacking the RNase III-sensitive structure. Several studies on ribosome binding and translation of an HCV mRNA spanning bases 1&#x02013;1350 (which contains the RNase III-sensitive structure) are available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>), but a systematic comparison of protein synthesis stimulated by the same HCV mRNA molecule, with and without the RNase III-sensitive structure (which can be blocked by cleavage or by oligonucleotides, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), is yet to be performed. Such studies will be necessary to determine whether the RNase III-sensitive structure promotes or inhibits ribosome binding and translation, or has no effect.</p><p>The 5&#x02032;-UTR of HCV genomic RNA encodes the start signal for genomic strand RNA synthesis (which is the 3&#x02032; end of the antigenomic, or minus, strand), as well as the IRES itself, suggesting a role for some of these sequences in both processes. One of the difficulties concerning a structure containing the two domains studied here&#x02014;one near the 5&#x02032; end of the HCV UTR involving bases 24&#x02013;38, the other including bases 428&#x02013;442&#x02014;was that earlier work had suggested a structure called stem&#x02013;loop VI within the core-coding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>), in which bases 428&#x02013;442 are base paired with bases 495&#x02013;508. In fact, the ability of these two potential structures to alternate could regulate a particular HCV RNA molecule's ability to participate in translation versus replication. Experiments comparing the stability of the proposed stem&#x02013;loop VI to the RNase III-sensitive structural element studied here will need to be performed before this idea can be evaluated.</p><p>The conditions described here allow reproducible, structure-dependent cleavage reactions which can produce specific RNA fragments for a variety of assays. For example, binding of translation initiation factors, La protein, PKR and ribosomal proteins could be conducted before and after RNase III treatment. In this way, both the boundaries of the IRES domain, and its structural inter-dependence with the flanking, RNase III-sensitive sequences, can be ascertained. Whatever the role of the RNase-sensitive structure, it allows new basic studies on IRES structure and function, and provides opportunities for RNAi and ribozyme therapeutics as well.</p></sec><sec><title>NOTE ADDED IN PROOF</title><p>Dr Hugh D.

These optimal conditions were used in all of the experiments. In (+) reactions the synthetic complementary RNA oligonucleotide was added to a final concentration of 15 nM. Lane 13 (&#x02018;M&#x02019;) contains RNA molecular weight markers composed of transcripts with a length of 82, 99, 110, 400 and 570 (S<sub>1</sub>) nt. Lanes starting from the left represent sequentially 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 min of incubation with RNase III without (&#x02212;) or with (+) complementary RNA oligonucleotide. Cleavage products were separated on 4% denaturing polyacrylamide gels and visualized by autoradiography. The arrows on the left indicate the products of the RNase III cleavage directed by the complementary oligonucleotide and on the right; the products of RNase III alone (P1+P2, P2 and P3) are indicated.
