Proliferative stimuli generally also induce apoptosis, and anti-apoptotic factors are required to allow net cell proliferation. Genetic studies in <italic>Drosophila</italic> have led to identification of a number of genes that control both processes, providing new insights into the mechanisms that coordinate cell growth, proliferation, and death during development and that fail to do so in diseases of cell proliferation. We present evidence that the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Sterile-20 kinase Slik promotes cell proliferation and controls cell survival. At normal levels, Slik provides survival cues that prevent apoptosis. Cells deprived of Slik activity can grow, divide, and differentiate, but have an intrinsic survival defect and undergo apoptosis even under conditions in which they are not competing with normal cells for survival cues. Like some oncogenes, excess Slik activity stimulates cell proliferation, but this is compensated for by increased cell death. Tumor-like tissue overgrowth results when apoptosis is prevented. We present evidence that Slik acts via Raf, but not via the canonical ERK pathway. Activation of Raf can compensate for the lack of Slik and support cell survival, but activation of ERK cannot. We suggest that Slik mediates growth and survival cues to promote cell proliferation and control cell survival during <italic>Drosophila</italic> development.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>Identification and characterization of Slik as a new regulator of cell growth and survival based on loss-of-function and overexpression analysis</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Growth of tissues and organs during animal development involves careful coordination of the rates of cell proliferation, cell death, and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000035-Neufeld1">Neufeld et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000035-Conlon1">Conlon and Raff 1999</xref>). Cell proliferation depends on signals to stimulate cell growth and cell division. Cell survival is also dependent on intercellular signaling. A diverse array of long-range signals mediated by growth factors and cytokines as well as short-range signals mediated by cell surface proteins has been implicated in providing cells with growth and survival cues during development.</p><p>Systematic genetic screens for alterations in tissue growth in <italic>Drosophila</italic> imaginal discs have led to identification of a number of genes that promote cell proliferation and cell survival. <italic>ras</italic>, <italic>myc</italic>, <italic>TSC1/TSC2</italic>, and genes in the insulin pathway have been implicated primarily in control of cellular growth rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000035-Johnston1">Johnston et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000035-Prober1">Prober and Edgar 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000035-Saucedo1">Saucedo and Edgar 2002</xref> &#x0005b;reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000035-Oldham1">Oldham and Hafen 2003</xref>&#x0005d;). Cell growth and division rates are normally well coordinated, but excess activity of the insulin pathway, Ras, or Myc can cause cells to grow faster than they divide, leading to cellular overgrowth and concomitant tissue overgrowth. Other genes that cause tissue overgrowth when overexpressed do so without distorting cell size. Cyclin D and Cdk4 act together to promote coordinated cellular growth and cell division, leading to net cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000035-Datar1">Datar et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000035-Meyer1">Meyer et al. 2000</xref>).

Salvador serves as a scaffold protein to bind the Warts serine&#x02013;threonine protein kinase and the recently identified Hippo Sterile-20 (Ste20) kinase. Cells mutant for any of the components of this complex exhibit elevated expression of cyclin E, which promotes cell proliferation and overrides developmentally controlled exit from proliferation, leading to tissue overgrowth. Mutant cells are also resistant to developmentally regulated apoptosis by virtue of increased expression of the apoptosis inhibitor DIAP1.</p><p>Here we present the identification of another member of the Ste20 kinase family that contributes to the control of cell proliferation and apoptosis during imaginal disc development. We have named the <italic>Drosophila</italic> gene <italic>slik</italic> (SLK- and LOK-like kinase) on the basis of its similarity to the human SLK and LOK Ste20 kinases. Slik activity is required to support cell survival. Survival of mutant cells is impaired when they are in competition with normal cells, but also occurs in the absence of cell competition, indicating that it is an intrinsic defect. Slik also promotes cell proliferation. Elevated Slik activity increases the rate of cell proliferation and also increases apoptosis. Tumor-like tissue overgrowth results when apoptosis is prevented. The phenotypes associated with <italic>slik</italic> mutants are essentially opposite to those of the Ste20 kinase Hippo<italic>,</italic> for which loss-of-function mutants cause tissue overgrowth and reduced apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000035-Harvey1">Harvey et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000035-Wu1">Wu et al. 2003</xref>). We suggest that Slik activity mediates growth and survival cues to promote cell proliferation and cell survival and present evidence that this depends on the activation of the MAP kinase kinase kinase (MAP3K) Raf, but not via the canonical extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) MAP kinase (MAPK) pathway.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Slik, a Ste20 Kinase Involved in Growth Control</title><p>Genes involved in regulating tissue growth were identified in a systematic overexpression screen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000035-Hipfner1">Hipfner et al. 2002</xref>). <italic>EPg(2)20348</italic> caused increased growth of the posterior compartment of the wing by 6&#x00025; without inducing pattern abnormalities when expressed under control of the <italic>en<sup>GAL4</sup></italic> driver. Though small in magnitude, this difference was reproducible and statistically significant. As will be shown below, considerably stronger growth effects were obtained when compensating apoptosis was prevented. To identify the gene overexpressed by <italic>EPg(2)20348</italic>, DNA flanking the single P-element insertion was sequenced.

The Ste20 group is a large and heterogeneous group of kinases, divided into two large families and ten distinct subfamilies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000035-Dan1">Dan et al. 2001</xref>). Members of different subfamilies show little sequence similarity outside of the kinase domain, reflecting the diversity of functions that have been attributed to these proteins. <italic>Drosophila</italic> contains one member of each of the ten subfamilies. The predicted Slik protein shows highest homology to two human proteins, SLK and LOK. Together these proteins form a subfamily of StE20 group kinases. The sequence similarity between them is largely restricted to an N-terminal kinase domain and a conserved C-terminal domain containing several coiled-coil motifs, separated by a nonconserved domain of variable length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.0000035-g001">Figure 1</xref>C).

To characterize this in more detail, we collected first-instar larvae shortly after hatching, cultured them at low density, and tracked their viability and developmental progress. <italic>slik<sup>1</sup></italic> homozygous mutant larvae were compared with similarly staged heterozygous control larvae. <italic>slik</italic> mutants were delayed with respect to growth and developmental timing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.0000035-g002">Figure 2</xref>B).

Relatively few progressed as far as the third-larval instar. However, some larvae had an abnormally long lifespan. More than 5&#x00025; of the mutant larvae remained alive for 15 d (three times longer than normal), and some reached a relatively normal third-larval instar size. To confirm that these defects are due to loss of <italic>slik</italic> function, we tested whether they could be reversed by expression of a <italic>slik</italic> transgene. Ubiquitous <italic>armadillo<sup>GAL4</sup></italic>-driven <italic>slik</italic> expression rescued the larval growth defect and lethality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.0000035-g002">Figure 2</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.0000035-g002">2</xref>C). Of 160 rescued mutant larvae examined, 115 survived to adulthood, albeit with a developmental delay of several days.

To ask whether <italic>slik</italic> regulates the endoreplication cycle, we cultured staged control and <italic>slik<sup>1</sup></italic> larvae on food containing bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) to label cells that had undergone DNA synthesis. Control larvae fed BrdU from 56 to 72 h or from 76 to 92 h showed extensive BrdU incorporation in larval tissues including the gut, fat body, and salivary glands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.0000035-g002">Figure 2</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.0000035-g002">2</xref>E).

Most animals showed a marked decrease in the number of labeled cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.0000035-g002">Figure 2</xref>F), suggesting that the proportion of cells undergoing endoreplication during the labeling period was decreased in the mutants. These observations indicate that <italic>slik</italic> is important for normal larval growth.

To determine whether <italic>slik</italic> function involves activation of MAPK signaling, we tested the ability of mutants in two <italic>Drosophila</italic> MAPK-type pathways (those mediated by JNK and ERK) to suppress <italic>slik</italic>-driven tissue growth.

A deficiency removing the <italic>Drosophila</italic> ERK Rolled had only a modest effect (15&#x00025;). These observations raise the possibility that ERK may not be a major effector of Slik in promoting cell proliferation, although Raf appears to be one (see below).</p><p>If Raf acts as a downstream effector of Slik, we would expect removing one copy of the <italic>raf</italic> gene to enhance the severity of <italic>slik</italic> mutant phenotypes.

The frequency of strongly affected wings increased from 11&#x00025; to nearly 50&#x00025; of the wings examined. The weaker <italic>phl<sup>HM7</sup></italic> allele caused a milder enhancement of these phenotypes.</p><p><italic>slik<sup>KG04837</sup></italic>/<italic>slik<sup>1</sup></italic> wing discs showed a considerable amount of apoptosis by TUNEL labeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.0000035-g010">Figure 10</xref>D). The amount of apoptosis in the <italic>slik<sup>KG04837</sup>/slik<sup>1</sup></italic> background increased when one copy of <italic>raf</italic> was removed (a 1.75-fold increase in the average number of TUNEL-positive cells, 2.0-fold increase in median; <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). We did not observe an increase in TUNEL-positive cells in <italic>phl<sup>EA75/&#x0002b;</sup></italic> heterozygotes compared to wild-type. Thus, reduction of Raf levels specifically increased the amount of apoptosis and the severity of the subsequent phenotypic effects when Slik activity was compromised. These results, together with the ability of Raf to suppress Slik gain-of-function phenotypes, suggest that Raf is an important downstream effector of Slik in providing cell survival and cell proliferation cues.</p><p>To test this, we asked whether expression of an activated form of Raf could compensate for the absence of Slik. Clones of <italic>slik<sup>1</sup></italic> mutant cells were produced using the Marcm system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000035-Lee1">Lee and Luo 1999</xref>) to allow GAL4-dependent expression of activated Raf in the <italic>slik<sup>1</sup></italic> mutant cells. Clones of GFP-expressing <italic>slik<sup>1</sup></italic> mutant cells were much smaller than their wild-type twin clones. In contrast, large <italic>slik<sup>1</sup></italic> mutant clones were recovered that expressed activated Raf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.0000035-g010">Figure 10</xref>E and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.0000035-g010">10</xref>F). These clones were located on the basal surface of the epithelium, grew to quite large sizes, and had few pyknotic nuclei (and little evidence of apoptosis by TUNEL labeling; data not shown). This contrasts with <italic>Minute<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> slik<sup>1</sup></italic> mutant clones, which showed very strongly elevated cell death inside the clones (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.0000035-g003">Figure 3</xref>E). Expression of p35 produced similar effects on survival of <italic>slik<sup>1</sup></italic> mutant clones (data not shown). Comparable experiments expressing an activated form of ERK (Rl<sup>SEM</sup>) did not suppress the survival defect of <italic>slik<sup>1</sup></italic> mutant clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.0000035-g010">Figure 10</xref>G). These clones are considerably smaller than their twins and contained many pyknotic nuclei, indicative of apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.0000035-g010">Figure 10</xref>G). The level of ERK activity generated by this transgene was sufficient to elicit the high threshold ERK response of vein formation. Thus, the failure to suppress cell death in <italic>slik</italic> mutant clones cannot be attributed to insufficient ERK activity (discussed below). These observations indicate that activation of Raf can suppress the survival defect and promote proliferation of <italic>slik<sup>1</sup></italic> mutant cells and suggest that Raf does not act via the canonical ERK MAPK pathway to do so. These differences may explain the strong genetic interactions between Slik and Raf mutants and the very limited genetic interaction between Slik and ERK (Rolled) mutants.</p><p>The strong genetic interactions between Slik and Raf prompted us to ask whether Slik can bind directly to Raf. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments were performed using S2 cells transfected to express Myc-tagged Raf. Immunoprecipitation of endogenous Slik protein from S2 cells was able to coprecipitate Raf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.0000035-g011">Figure 11</xref>, lane 6; the loading control represents 25&#x00025; of input). Cotransfection of S2 cells to express Slik or the kinase inactive Slik<sup>kd</sup> increased the recovery of Raf in the coimmunoprecipitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.0000035-g011">Figure 11</xref>, lanes 4 and 5). The relationship between Slik and Raf resembles that reported for the Ste20 kinase germinal center kinase (GCK) and the MAP3K MEKK1 in that GCK binds to MEKK1 and activates it in a kinase-independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000035-Chadee1">Chadee et al. 2002</xref>). Our results suggest that activation of Raf is mediated by binding to Slik, rather than by phosphorylation of Raf by Slik. We examined the level of ERK phosphorylation in S2 cells transfected to overexpress Slik or Slik<sup>kd</sup>. No significant difference was observed (data not shown). Taken together with the finding that expression of activated ERK cannot rescue the <italic>slik</italic> mutant survival defect in vivo, these findings suggest that Raf does not act via the canonical ERK MAPK pathway to mediate Slik's activity in supporting cell survival and promoting cell proliferation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this report we have identified the Ste20 group kinase Slik as a mediator of cell survival and cell proliferation signaling in <italic>Drosophila. slik</italic> is an essential gene. Loss of <italic>slik</italic> function results in a larval growth defect characterized by slow growth and a decreased rate of endoreplicative cell cycling in polyploid larval cells, developmental delay, and eventually death. The behavior of <italic>slik</italic> mutant clones suggests that diploid cells lacking <italic>slik</italic> proliferate more slowly than normal and are eliminated by apoptosis. Even when removed from cell competition, <italic>slik</italic> mutant cells exhibit an intrinsic survival defect. Our findings suggest that this is due to insufficient activation of Raf. Indeed, activation of Raf can compensate for the absence of Slik in supporting cell survival. Whereas reduced Slik activity limits growth due to increased apoptosis, increased Slik activity promotes growth by increasing the rate of cell proliferation. Slik-induced proliferation is counteracted by increased apoptosis. The increase in proliferation and apoptosis is due to overactivation of Raf, as both proliferation and apoptosis can be suppressed by reducing Raf activity. These observations suggest that Raf may be the principal mediator of Slik activity in promoting cell survival and cell proliferation.</p><p>At present, the upstream signals that control Slik activity are not known.

Signals from receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) act via the small GTPase Ras to activate Raf (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000035-Schlessinger1">Schlessinger 2000</xref>). In its GTP-bound active state, Ras recruits Raf to the cell membrane, where it is activated by a mechanism involving protein&#x02013;protein and protein&#x02013;lipid interactions as well as phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of key residues (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000035-Dhillon1">Dhillon and Kolch 2002</xref>). Some members of the Ste20 kinase family act as MAP4Ks to activate Raf and other MAP3Ks, whereas others act in a kinase-independent manner (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000035-Dan1">Dan et al. 2001</xref>). HPK1 and PAK2 act as MAP4Ks to phosphorylate MEKK1 and Raf. The Ste20 protein GCK activates MEKK1 in a kinase-independent manner to transduce signals from TNF family receptors via the JNK pathway. Oligomerization of MEKK1 by GCK1 is thought to lead to its activation by autophosphporylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000035-Chadee1">Chadee et al. 2002</xref>).

If there is a difference in the ability of the two forms of Slik to activate Raf, it does not appear to be reflected in their ability to bind Raf as assayed by coimmunoprecipitation, but many other possibilities exist. For example, Slik kinase activity may not be required for Raf activation, but may be required to allow Slik to perform other functions during development.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Does Slik Have Other Functions?</title><p>Preliminary evidence suggests that Slik may also regulate the actin cytoskeleton.

Activation of ERK in proliferating wing cells is not detectable by this antibody. Clones of cells lacking Slik activity do not cause defects in vein differentiation or in cell fate specification in the eye (data not shown). Elevated Slik expression stimulates cell proliferation, but does not cause a detectable increase in the level of ERK phosphorylation in S2 cells (data not shown). This suggests that Slik-mediated activation of Raf is not required for high-threshold ERK responses.</p><p>Both Raf and Sor (MAPKK) act downstream of Slik based on the ability of mutations in either kinase to dominantly suppress Slik-induced tissue growth. However, a deficiency removing ERK had little effect in the same assay. It may be that that ERK levels are not limiting because Slik is involved only in low-level ERK activation. Alternatively, Slik may regulate Raf- and MEK-dependent survival and proliferation independently of ERK. This view is supported by our finding that activation of Raf is able to replace the requirement for Slik and support survival of <italic>slik</italic> mutant cells, whereas activation of ERK is not able to do so. There is increasing evidence supporting an ERK-independent function of Raf proteins, particularly in the regulation of cell survival/apoptosis (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000035-Hindley1">Hindley and Kolch 2002</xref>).

In flies, the <italic>bantam</italic> microRNA has been shown to promote cell proliferation and to simultaneously suppress apoptosis by translational repression of the proapoptotic gene <italic>hid</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000035-Brennecke1">Brennecke et al. 2003</xref>). Like Ras and E2F, Slik activity simultaneously promotes cell proliferation and apoptosis. Substantial increases in cell number and tissue size are observed only when <italic>slik</italic>-induced apoptosis is blocked by coexpression of p35. In some cases, this resulted in tumor-like outgrowths in the wing. It will be of interest to learn whether the mammalian SLK and LOK proteins play a similar role in the control of growth and apoptosis.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title/><sec id="s4a1"><title>Fly strains</title><p>The 2300 EP lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000035-Rorth1">Rorth et al. 1998</xref>) and 8500 EPg strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000035-Mata1">Mata et al. 2000</xref>) were screened as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.0000035-Hipfner1">Hipfner et al. 2002</xref>). <italic>KG04837</italic> was kindly provided by Hugo Bellen.

Embryos were collected for approximately 6 h on apple juice agar plates. After 24 h, newly hatched GFP-negative (<italic>slik</italic> homozygous mutant) and GFP-positive (heterozygous control) larvae were sorted, and 40&#x02013;50 animals were transferred to vials containing softened food. Beginning 4 d later, larvae were collected every 2 d by floating them in 20&#x00025; sucrose. After counting and assessment of the larval stage of each animal based on size and appearance of mouth hooks, they were returned to fresh vials. The progress to pupal stages and eclosion was also scored. To rescue the larval growth defect by transgene expression, females of the same genotype were crossed to <italic>UAS-slik/Y; FRT42D slik<sup>1</sup>/CyO Kr<sup>GAL4</sup> UAS-GFP</italic> males. In this case, only female GFP-negative offspring received the <italic>UAS-slik</italic> transgene. We therefore expected to see a rescue in only half of the animals. For BrdU labeling, larvae were transferred onto fly food containing 0.1 mg/ml BrdU. Larvae were dissected 16 h later and fixed in 8&#x00025; formaldehyde/PBS, and BrdU incorporation was detected by standard techniques. Wing disc BrdU labeling was performed by incubating dissected larval anterior halves in serum-free medium containing 0.2 mg/ml BrdU for 1 h. To measure <italic>slik</italic> mutant clone areas, <italic>w hs-FLP1; FRT42D armadillo-lacZ</italic> females were crossed to <italic>FRT42D slik<sup>1</sup>/Cyo Kr<sup>GAL4</sup> UAS-GFP</italic> males.

Larvae were heat-shocked at 48 &#x000b1; 2 h for 1 h at 37&#x000b0;C and dissected at 112 &#x000b1; 2 h. Mutant clone and twinspot areas were measured from confocal images using the histogram function of Adobe Photoshop (Adobe Systems Incorporated, San Jose, California, United States). TUNEL labeling was performed as described (Mil&#x003b1;n et al. 1997). Levels of TUNEL staining were measured from confocal images of <italic>slik<sup>KG04837</sup>/slik<sup>1</sup></italic> (n &#x0003d; 13) and <italic>phl<sup>EA75</sup>/&#x0002b;;slik<sup>KG04837</sup>/slik<sup>1</sup></italic> (n &#x0003d; 16) wing discs using functions of Adobe Photoshop. For the analysis of Slik overexpression phenotypes, <italic>w; ptc<sup>GAL4</sup> UAS-GFP</italic> females were crossed to either <italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic>, <italic>UAS-slik</italic>, <italic>UAS-slik;UAS-p35</italic>, <italic>UAS-slik<sup>kd</sup></italic>, or <italic>UAS-slik<sup>kd</sup>; UAS-p35</italic> males. Embryos were collected for approximately 6 h and transferred to 18&#x000b0;C. After 24 h, newly hatched first-instar larvae (40 per vial) were transferred onto fresh food and returned to 18&#x000b0;C. Larvae were dissected at the wandering third-instar stage. Co-expression of Slik and p35 caused a developmental delay of approximately 2 d. Some vials were left at 18&#x000b0;C and adult flies were collected. Wings were mounted and imaged, and areas were measured using NIH Image (National Institute of Mental Health, Bethesda, Maryland, United States).</p></sec><sec id="s4a5"><title>Antibodies</title><p>Mouse anti-BrdU was from PharMingen (San Diego, California, United States).
