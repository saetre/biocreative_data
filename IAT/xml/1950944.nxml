During early embryogenesis, one of two X chromosomes in every female cell is inactivated, and the inactive X chromosome is stably inherited through cell divisions of somatic cells. Although precise timing is not given, the inactive X chromosome is known to be reactivated during germ cell development. It is generally believed that the dynamics of X chromosome activity is tightly correlated with major genomic reprogramming events occurring during mammalian development. Therefore, elucidation of the X reactivation kinetics is important for understanding the mechanism of X chromosome inactivation/reactivation processes and the epigenetic reprogramming processes as well. Here we investigated when X reactivation is initiated during development of female mouse germ cells. Contrary to the previous suggestions, X reactivation already begins in nascent primordial germ cells in female mice and proceeds gradually requiring a prolonged period. The activity status of the X chromosomes of germ cells appears to vary from cell-to-cell and from gene-to-gene during the reactivation processes. These results indicate that the X reactivation coincides with the formation of germ cells and suggest that this involves slow passive steps.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Sugimoto M, Abe K (2007) X chromosome reactivation initiates in nascent primordial germ cells in mice.

Most of the X-linked genes were monoallelically expressed in 13 of 21 samples.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030116-g003">Figure 3</xref>, derepression of the X-linked genes did not appear to proceed linearly, probably due to the limited number of PGCs assayed. However, most of the X-linked genes tested showed gradual reactivation in the course of PGC development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030116-g003">Figure 3</xref>B).</p><p>The prevailing view suggests that X reactivation begins soon after the entry of PGCs into the genital ridge and before the initiation of meiosis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030116-b016">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030116-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;.

Two genes, <italic>Np15</italic> and <italic>Hprt,</italic> were reactivated in all the samples, but other genes showed variable results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030116-g003">Figure 3</xref>B; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030116-st001">Table S1</xref>). In particular, <italic>G6pd</italic> and <italic>Rex3</italic> tended to show monoallelic expression. Because all the genes except <italic>Rex3</italic> were completely reactivated in oocytes, E14.5 PGCs are probably still in the process of X reactivation.</p><p>Unexpectedly, we found that many single PGCs at E14.5 expressed one gene from the paternal X chromosome and the other from the maternal X chromosome. For example, as shown in lane 14&#x02013;2 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030116-g002">Figure 2</xref>, in this particular cell, <italic>G6pd</italic> showed monoallelic expression from the maternal <italic>domesticus</italic> type X chromosome, whereas <italic>Rex3</italic> was expressed from the paternal <italic>molossinus</italic> allele. Such &#x0201c;mosaic&#x0201d; patterns of expression were frequently (11/24) observed in E14.5 PGCs but rare in earlier PGCs. Only one each of PGC at E7.75 and E8.75 showed a mosaic pattern (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030116-st001">Table S1</xref>). It is likely, therefore, that this is a phenomenon specific to E14.5 PGCs or to PGCs undergoing meiosis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here, we showed that the cessation of <italic>Xist</italic> RNA transcription had already been initiated in newly formed PGCs, and some X-linked genes were actually reactivated in these nascent PGCs. Furthermore, <italic>Xist</italic> accumulation was completely undetectable at E10.5, more than two days before the initiation of meiosis in female PGCs. However, the reactivation of X-linked genes was not complete even at E14.5, when meiotic division is initiated in most of female PGCs.</p><p>Despite their biological importance, the timing of both the inactivation and reactivation of the X chromosome has not been precisely determined in PGC. In previous studies of X reactivation, the results were based on the expression of protein products, which lags behind dynamic changes in RNA expression. Somatic contamination of germ cell samples might have disturbed previous studies. In contrast, we assessed the inactivation status in PGCs using whole-mount RNA FISH and measured X chromosome activity directly by detecting the allelic transcripts of ten X-linked genes in single PGCs. The use of multiple appropriate markers for each stage of PGC development further increased the validity of our assay.</p><p>Among the earliest PGCs marked by <italic>Blimp1</italic> expression, there were some cells showing no <italic>Xist</italic> expression, and hence undergoing X reactivation. This may imply delayed X inactivation in the germ line as suggested previously by Tam et al. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030116-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;, who assessed the X inactivation and reactivation status by examining the X-linked <italic>lacZ</italic> transgene expression. However, even at E7.0 a large number of cells (77.5&#x00025;) possessed <italic>Xist</italic> paint signals, indicating that most of the PGCs and/or their precursor cells are not exempt from X inactivation. Because the numbers of such <italic>Xist</italic> (&#x0002b;) cells decreased and <italic>Xist</italic> (&#x02212;) cells increased progressively in number, the simplest interpretation is that while every epiblast cell in the early egg cylinder undergoes X inactivation once, PGC precursor cells in the epiblast are somehow susceptible to reactivation. Thus, X reactivation is likely to occur slightly before the advent of PGC. It is tempting to speculate that the initiation of X reactivation coincides with the determination of the germ-cell lineage.</p><p>We found that a significant number of X-linked genes showed monoallelic expression even though <italic>Xist</italic> painting was no longer observed. Similar observation made by Csankovszki et al. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030116-b035">35</xref>&#x0005d; suggests that continued <italic>Xist</italic> expression is not essential for maintenance of the inactive state after establishment of the X inactivation in vitro. Here, we showed that <italic>Xist</italic> expression and accumulation were hardly detected in E10.5 PGCs, but several X-linked genes were still monoallelically expressed even at E14.5. To our knowledge, these results are the first to demonstrate that the maintenance of X inactivation does not require <italic>Xist</italic> RNA accumulation on the inactive X chromosome in normal embryonic development in vivo.</p><p>Furthermore, we observed &#x0201c;mosaic&#x0201d; patterns of mono- and biallelic expression of X-linked genes in E14.5 PGCs in which no <italic>Xist</italic> signals were detected as described above. This phenomenon could be explained by very low expression levels of these genes at this stage, causing biased PCR amplification resulting in &#x0201c;pseudo&#x0201d; monoallelic expression. However, our microarray data (N. Mise and K. Abe, unpublished data) showed that steady state mRNA levels of these genes were high (and constant) at both E12.5 and E14.5 stages. Therefore, it is likely that the mosaic expression pattern may be caused by intermingling of inactive and active chromosomal regions through meiotic recombination. Further investigations on this mosaicism would provide insight into roles of &#x0201c;chromatin environment&#x0201d; in establishment and maintenance of X inactivation status.</p><p>Another important finding presented here is that X reactivation is not completed within a narrow window of time during development. Genome reprogramming events in PGCs represented by imprinting erasure and X reactivation are thought to take place over a short period of time, perhaps during the transition from pregonadal to gonadal PGCs &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030116-b002">2</xref>&#x0005d;. Our results demonstrate that X reactivation proceeds gradually in a stepwise fashion, requiring a relatively long time (&#x02265;7 d). As the first step, the cessation of <italic>Xist</italic> occurred, and reactivation of a few X-linked genes already commenced during E7.0&#x02013;E10.5. By E10.5, <italic>Xist</italic> accumulation on the inactive X chromosome has almost completely gone. After E10.5, reactivation of X-linked genes was accelerated significantly, and most of the X-linked genes tested showed biallelic expression in the next two days. As this second phase of reactivation is more prominent than the first one, previous studies might have overlooked the early commencement of the X reactivation. However, the X reactivation in fact has initiated as soon as PGC differentiation occurs, and this fact may change a general view on X inactivation/reactivation and genomic reprogramming phenomena in the germ cell lineage. During PGC development, their number increases from 50 to 25,000 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030116-b036">36</xref>&#x0005d;, involving more than nine cell divisions. The activity status of the X chromosomes of PGCs during this period appears to vary from cell-to-cell and from gene-to-gene. There are certain tendencies for some genes to be reactivated earlier than other genes, and one could also argue that genes distant from the <italic>Xist</italic> locus tend to be reactivated earlier than genes close to the <italic>Xist</italic>. Further extended analyses on expression of other X-linked genes and their surrounding genomic sequences will be needed to make definitive statements on this point.</p><p>The present study suggests that X reactivation in PGCs is not involved in active epigenetic remodeling, but may instead involve slow passive steps that require many cell divisions. In contrast, X reactivation events observed at peri-implantation stages (and zygotic gene activation) are completed in a much shorter period of time &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030116-b021">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030116-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d;. Kinetics of X reactivation in PGCs is rather similar to that of the reversal of X inactivation induced by cell fusion between an embryonal carcinoma cell and female somatic cell &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030116-b037">37</xref>&#x0005d;, for which four to five cell divisions are required &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030116-b038">38</xref>&#x0005d;. These differences in kinetics of each reactivation process seem to reflect differences in mode of epigenetic regulation operating in random and imprinted X inactivation.</p><p>For maintenance of random X inactivation, methylation of CpG sites at the 5&#x02032; region of X-linked genes is important (reviewed in &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030116-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d;). In a mutant deficient for maintenance DNA methyltransferase <italic>(Dnmt1),</italic> random X inactivation in the embryonic lineage is unstable, whereas the imprinted X inactivation in the extraembryonic lineage was unaffected &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030116-b039">39</xref>&#x0005d;, suggesting differences in the epigenetic state of the X chromosome in the two lineages. It is generally thought that global DNA methylation level is relatively low in the extraembryonic lineage and that imprinted X inactivation in this lineage is less stable compared to random X inactivation in embryonic lineage. In the extraembryonic lineage, therefore, the epigenetic gene-silencing mechanism may not rely on DNA methylation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030116-b039">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030116-b040">40</xref>&#x0005d;, and erasure of the repressive state may be more readily accomplished. In contrast, DNA methylation is apparently important for establishment and maintenance of random X inactivation in embryo proper &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030116-b039">39</xref>&#x0005d;, and reactivation of the DNA methylation-dependent inactive state may require a longer period. Seki et al. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030116-b041">41</xref>&#x0005d; reported that global DNA methylation is substantially removed from migrating PGCs at around E8.0, and we also found that expression of all the DNA methyltransferases is hardly detected at an even earlier stage (S. Kobayakawa and K. Abe, unpublished data), suggesting that genome-wide erasure of DNA methylation commences from a very early stage of PGC development. Seki et al. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030116-b041">41</xref>&#x0005d; also demonstrated that global DNA methylation was further reduced between the stages E9.5 and E12.5. Such two-step reduction of global DNA methylation approximately coincides with the stepwise processes of X reactivation described here. Therefore, the unique epigenetic properties of the PGC genome likely constitute a foundation for the prolonged reactivation process.</p><p>As described, X reactivation may be a consequence of genome-wide epigenomic remodeling in PGCs, but the reactivation should have its own biological significance. One obvious reason is to avoid producing &#x0201c;inactive X&#x02013;Y&#x0201d; offspring, in which no active X chromosome exists. On the other hand, female mice carrying only one X chromosome, X0 mice, are fertile, and in X0 female embryos PGCs have a single active X chromosome throughout their development. During maturation, some X0 oocytes release a first polar body containing the X chromosome and become mature oocytes without the X chromosome. When these &#x0201c;0-oocytes&#x0201d; fertilize with &#x0201c;X-sperm,&#x0201d; they develop as phenotypically normal female mice. Therefore, twice the amount of transcripts from the X chromosome is not essential for female germ cell development.</p><p>We think that the presence of two active (or euchromatic) X chromosomes may be needed for successful meiotic recombination. The inactive X chromosome is highly heterochromatic (reviewed in &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030116-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d;), and heterochromatic chromosomal regions are generally underrepresented in the synaptonemal complex &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030116-b042">42</xref>&#x0005d;. Pairing of active and inactive X is thus difficult to achieve, resulting in strong recombination suppression. Therefore, X reactivation in germ cells may have significance for appropriate segregation of X chromosome into mature oocytes.</p><p>In conclusion, we made an unexpected finding that initiation of X reactivation coincides with onset of PGC formation. Germ cell specification appears to be associated with genome-wide epigenetic reprogramming &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030116-b041">41</xref>&#x0005d;, raising the issue of how chromosome-wide X reactivation and genome-wide epigenetic changes are related. The kinetics of the X reactivation indicates that this process requires a prolonged period, suggesting that passive mechanisms may be involved. We found negligible <italic>Tsix</italic> expression in PGCs during the reactivation process. Recently, it was shown that CpG methylation of the <italic>Xist</italic> promoter region is mediated by <italic>Tsix</italic> transcription itself &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030116-b007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030116-b043">43</xref>&#x0005d;. However, results presented in this study suggest that repression of <italic>Xist</italic> transcription during the reactivation process in PGCs is probably not mediated by <italic>Tsix</italic> transcription. Therefore, X reactivation is not exactly a reversal process of X inactivation. Apparently X reactivation process holds many important, unanswered questions, and we believe that investigation on this process will lead to better understandings of mechanisms of X inactivation, genomic reprogramming, and germ&#x02013;soma differentiation in mammals.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Mice.</title><p>To create a transgenic construct for mRFP under the control of the <italic>Blimp1</italic> regulatory elements, we used a highly efficient <named-content content-type="genus-species">Escherichia coli</named-content>-based chromosome engineering system &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030116-b044">44</xref>&#x0005d;.

A single primer pair (5&#x02032;-TGGATGGTGTGGCCAATG-3&#x02032; and 5&#x02032;-CACCTGCACGTTGCCCTT-3&#x02032;) amplifies both the X-linked <italic>Ube1x</italic> and Y-linked <italic>Ube1y</italic> sequences but yields products of different sizes (<italic>Ube1x</italic>, 252 bp and <italic>Ube1y</italic>, 334 bp).</p><p>Single cells were incubated in reverse transcription buffer supplemented with 0.1&#x00025; NP-40 and 0.5 U of RQ1 RNase-free DNase (Promega, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.promega.com">http://www.promega.com</ext-link>) for 15 min at 37 &#x000b0;C, for 3 min at 75 &#x000b0;C, and for 5 min on ice. Reverse transcription was carried out by adding 0.5 &#x003bc;l of 0.5 &#x003bc;g/&#x003bc;l oligo dT<sub>18</sub> primer, 0.5 &#x003bc;l of 10 mM dNTP mix (Invitrogen), and 0.5 &#x003bc;l of 200 U/&#x003bc;l SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). This was followed by incubation at 50 &#x000b0;C for 1 h. The reactions were incubated at 37 &#x000b0;C for 15 min with 1 U of RNase H (Invitrogen). We carried out two rounds of PCR amplification of the cDNA to detect 11 sequences of ten X-linked genes (exons 1 and 7 of <italic>Xist, Tsix, Np15, Hprt, Fmr1, G6pd, Zfp261, Rex3, Fgd1,</italic> and <italic>Pdha1</italic>) and the sequences of three PGC markers <italic>(Stella, Oct4,</italic> and <italic>Mvh)</italic> in single cells. The X-linked genes, apart from <italic>Xist</italic> and <italic>Tsix,</italic> were selected because they showed relatively high expression in PGCs according to our microarray analysis (unpublished data). We designed these primer sequences carefully to avoid amplifications of pseudogenes and to include SNPs in the amplicons for distinction of BDF1 and MSM/Ms alleles. For the first PCR, we used a mixture of all the primers listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030116-st002">Table S2</xref> to amplify all of the sequences in 100-&#x003bc;l reactions. Aliquots (0.5 &#x003bc;l) of the first PCR products were used as templates for the second PCR in 20-&#x003bc;l reactions. Each primer pair listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030116-st002">Table S2</xref> was used to amplify specific sequences in each single-cell-derived sample. For each series of experiment, we included negative controls; a single cell was processed in the same way as the experimental group except for the addition of reverse transcriptase. We had no amplification at all from negative controls. The second PCR products were digested with the appropriate restriction enzymes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030116-st002">Table S2</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pgen-0030116-sg001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><title>Whole-Mount RNA FISH with <italic>Xist</italic> Probe in E12.5 Female PGCs</title><p><italic>Xist</italic> RNA signal is red, and Cot-1 signal is white.
