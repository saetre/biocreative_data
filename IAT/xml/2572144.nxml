CTL specifically target infected cells through the recognition of peptides, which are displayed by surface exposed HLA class I molecules. In most cell types, HLA class I-associated peptides are generally derived from intracellularly synthesized proteins. For the processing in the endogenous antigen presentation pathway, peptides are generated by the proteasome and translocated by the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) to the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, where they are trimmed and loaded onto HLA class I molecules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000198-Rock1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000198-Trombetta1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. The resulting complexes of mature HLA class I molecules and peptides are transported through the secretory pathway for display on the cell surface, where they can interact with CTL. In contrast, exogenous soluble antigens are typically internalized by antigen-presenting cells (APC) via the endosomal route, proteolytically fragmented in acidic endosomal compartments and loaded onto HLA class II molecules to produce a mature complex, which is capable of interacting with CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T helper (Th) cells. However, APC have the capacity to internalize pathogens as well as infected and abnormal cells from their environment and direct them to the endogenous HLA class I processing machinery by a process termed cross-presentation. Efficient cross-presentation of exogenous antigens is achieved by dendritic cells and macrophages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000198-KovacsovicsBankowski1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000198-Sigal1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, but also by B cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000198-Heit1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, endothelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000198-Limmer1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref> and neutrophils <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000198-Tvinnereim1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref> via various routes for antigen delivery from endosomes and phagosomes to the cytosol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000198-Rock2">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000198-Rodriguez1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref> or by direct processing of captured antigens in intracellular vesicles or at the plasma membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000198-Rock2">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000198-Castellino1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000198-Gromme1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>.

Heparinized whole blood obtained from HLA B8-positive EBV-positive individuals was stimulated with either 10 &#x000b5;g/ml urea-adjuvated BZLF1 (uBZLF1) or dialyzed urea-free BZLF1, while the synthetic RAK peptide and a 0.04 M urea solution served as positive and negative controls, respectively. Exposure of blood cells with uBZLF1 induced the reactivation of substantial numbers of CTL as shown by intracellular IFN-&#x003b3; staining, which was not seen in cells stimulated with BZLF1 or 0.04 M urea (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000198-g001">Fig. 1</xref>), even after prolongued incubation times (data not shown). In addition, the frequencies and ratios of specifically reactivated CTL upon stimulation with uBZLF1 and the RAK peptide differed significantly in blood samples of individual donors. The removal of urea from uBZLF1 by extensive dialysis resulted in an almost complete loss of its capacity to stimulated CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cells.
