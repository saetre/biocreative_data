It is known that Ebola virus requires endocytosis to establish an infection. However, the cellular signals that mediate this uptake were unknown for Ebola virus as well as many other viruses. Here, the involvement of PI3K in Ebola virus entry was studied. A novel and critical role of the PI3K signaling pathway was demonstrated in cell entry of Zaire Ebola virus (ZEBOV). Inhibitors of PI3K and Akt significantly reduced infection by ZEBOV at an early step during the replication cycle. Furthermore, phosphorylation of Akt-1 was induced shortly after exposure of cells to radiation-inactivated ZEBOV, indicating that the virus actively induces the PI3K pathway and that replication was not required for this induction. Subsequent use of pseudotyped Ebola virus and/or Ebola virus-like particles, in a novel virus entry assay, provided evidence that activity of PI3K/Akt is required at the virus entry step. Class 1A PI3Ks appear to play a predominant role in regulating ZEBOV entry, and Rac1 is a key downstream effector in this regulatory cascade. Confocal imaging of fluorescently labeled ZEBOV indicated that inhibition of PI3K, Akt, or Rac1 disrupted normal uptake of virus particles into cells and resulted in aberrant accumulation of virus into a cytosolic compartment that was non-permissive for membrane fusion. We conclude that PI3K-mediated signaling plays an important role in regulating vesicular trafficking of ZEBOV necessary for cell entry. Disruption of this signaling leads to inappropriate trafficking within the cell and a block in steps leading to membrane fusion. These findings extend our current understanding of Ebola virus entry mechanism and may help in devising useful new strategies for treatment of Ebola virus infection.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Each year, filoviruses such as Ebola virus claim many human lives and decimate gorilla populations in Africa. Infection results in an acute fever often associated with profuse internal and external bleeding and death rates of up to 90&#x00025;. Due to these symptoms and high pathogenicity, these viruses have been heavily publicized in the media. The first step of infection is entry, where the virus is taken up and penetrates into the cell, from which it spreads throughout the body. While it is known that the cell must engulf the virus by the process of endocytosis, we know little about how the virus triggers this event. Here, we use a novel technology to measure penetration of Ebola virus into the cell in real time and show that Ebola virus stimulates phosphoinositide-3 kinase, a signaling molecule known to induce endocytosis. Importantly, drugs that interfere with this signaling inhibit infection by Ebola virus and block virus spread. This work provides a mechanistic insight into how Ebola virus manipulates the cell to start an infection, may explain part of virus induced pathogenesis, and provides a potential way to treat this deadly disease.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Ebola virus, a member of the family <italic>Filoviridae</italic>, is an emerging infectious agent that causes severe and often fatal hemorrhagic fever in humans and nonhuman primates. In many outbreaks, especially those caused by Zaire Ebola virus (ZEBOV), mortality rates close to 90&#x00025; have been reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000141-Pourrut1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Currently, no vaccine or therapy is available for Ebola virus hemorrhagic fever. Significant mortality rate, high transmissibility and lack of therapeutic and preventive measures make Ebola virus a potentially serious public health threat.</p><p>Ebola viruses are filamentous enveloped viruses. The envelope contains two virally-encoded glycoproteins, GP1 and GP2, which together serve as the primary viral determinant for entry into host cells. The two glycoproteins are produced from a precursor protein (GP), which is cleaved by a furin-like endoprotease to generate surface-bound protein GP1 and the transmembrane protein GP2, the two proteins, remain associated by a disulfide bridge after cleavage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000141-Volchkov1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. As with many enveloped viruses, entry of ZEBOV into cells likely involves virus particles binding to host cell receptor(s), followed by endocytosis and trafficking through vesicular compartments, and finally fusion of the virus membrane to that of the endocytic vesicle. This results in release of the viral nucleocapsid into the cytoplasm where the subsequent steps of the replication cycle take place <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000141-Aman1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. GP1 is believed to mediate interaction with the host cell receptor, while GP2 is involved in membrane fusion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000141-Aman1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Membrane fusion is believed to involve a GP2 structural rearrangement triggered by low pH in an endocytic compartment. In addition, intracellular processing of GP1 by endosomal cathepsins is also a prerequisite to membrane fusion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000141-Chandran1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, an important aspect of ZEBOV entry involves endocytic trafficking into the cell.</p><p>Recent work has shown that many viruses exploit host cell molecules and signaling pathways to facilitate various steps of the entry process. A critical role of focal adhesion kinase and protein kinase C was described for endocytosis and endosomal sorting of West Nile virus in mosquito cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000141-Chu1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, and recently, Rho A and its upstream tyrosine kinases were implicated in endocytosis and trafficking of poliovirus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000141-Coyne1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. However, for most viruses, especially enveloped viruses, information on the requirements of cell signaling for entry is limited. Important advances have been made regarding the entry of Ebola virus and the role of the envelope glycoproteins in cell attachment and endocytosis (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000141-Dolnik1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>). However, our understanding of the role of cell signaling in virus entry remains limited.</p><p>The phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI3K) pathway is an important cell signaling pathway that regulates diverse cellular activities including proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, migration, metabolism, and vesicular trafficking <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000141-Hawkins1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. PI3Ks (OMIM#601232; Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man database: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrezdbomim">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrezdbomim</ext-link>) are a family of lipid kinases that are divided into three classes according to their structure and substrate specificity. Of these, class I PI3Ks are the most widely studied. They signal through cell surface protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) or G-protein coupled (GPC) receptors. Activation of PI3K results in phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol-bis phosphates to produce phosphatidylinositol-triphosphates, which serve as potent second messengers for downstream signaling. Akt-1 (OMIM#164730), is a key downstream intermediate in PI3K-dependent signaling. A variety of molecules are directly or indirectly regulated by Akt, and serve as downstream effectors to carry out diverse PI3K-regulated responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000141-Manning1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Regulation of vesicular trafficking is one of the oldest recognized functions of PI3Ks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000141-Schu1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. PI3Ks influence a variety of intracellular trafficking events that include cargo selection, vesicle formation, vesicle movement and membrane fusion. This is often through stimulation of actin turnover <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000141-Lanzetti1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Rac1 (OMIM#602048), along with other Rho family GTPases, is a key effector in this process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000141-Brown1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore the regulation of Rac1 by class 1 PI3Ks, as seen in many cell types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000141-RiouxBilan1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000141-Pan1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, provides a mechanism to couple receptor-ligand interaction to induction of endocytosis as well as other actin-mediated functions in the cell. Bacterial pathogens have been shown to take advantage of this mechanism by stimulating phagocytosis and internalization through PI3K activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000141-Allen1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000141-Araki1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Similarly, interaction of the non-enveloped adenovirus with receptors on the cell surface was shown to activate Rac1 and Cdc42 (OMIM#116952) in a PI3K-dependent manner, and this was required for virus uptake into endosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000141-Nemerow1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. However, similar dependencies for enveloped viruses have not been described. Here we investigated the role of PI3K cell signaling pathway in cellular entry of ZEBOV. The findings indicated that ZEBOV induces activation of PI3K pathway prior to or during entry and that activity of class 1A PI3Ks is critical for entry into host cells. Rac1 GTPase was found to be an important downstream effector in regulating ZEBOV entry. The impact of inhibiting PI3K, Akt or Rac1 was similar, causing an aberrant accumulation of ZEBOV particles in intracellular vesicles, indicating a role of the PI3K-Akt-Rac1 pathway in vesicular trafficking of virus particles.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>PI3K activity is important for an early event(s) in ZEBOV infection</title><p>Several viruses utilize the PI3K-Akt pathway to support replication in host cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000141-Halasz1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000141-Hale1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, however, involvement of this pathway in early events of infection such as entry has not been conclusively demonstrated for enveloped viruses. We investigated the effect of LY294002 (a highly specific inhibitor of PI3K) on infection by wild type ZEBOV. To determine if the drug was acting early or late in the infection cycle, cells were exposed to drug only during the first 2 h of incubation with the virus. Subsequently, the drug and the unbound virus were removed, and infection was allowed to continue. As compared to untreated cells, the infection of ZEBOV was significantly (nearly 10-fold) reduced in cells treated with LY294002 (<italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.01).

A similar level of inhibition of ZEBOV infection was observed when a specific Akt inhibitor was used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000141-g001">Figure 1</xref>).

To address this question, phosphorylation of Akt-1 was measured in cells after incubation with ZEBOV. Akt is a major downstream effector of the PI3K pathway and is phosphorylated (activated) following activation of PI3K. Therefore, Akt phosphorylation is often used as an indirect, but reliable measure of PI3K pathway activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000141-Mannova1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000141-Hale1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>.

Compared to the negative control, ZEBOV caused a marked (&#x0003e;2-fold) increase in Akt phosphorylation within 30 min and actually surpassed the level observed after serum stimulation of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000141-g002">Figure 2</xref>). In contrast, VSV had no significant effect on phosphorylation of Akt-1 over this time interval. These data suggested that ZEBOV actively and strongly induces the PI3K pathway very early during the infection process. Since &#x003b3;-radiation-inactivated virus had been used, it was likely that this stimulation was the product of direct GP interaction with cell receptors.</p><fig id="ppat-1000141-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1000141.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>ZEBOV particles induce Akt-1 phosphorylation early during infection.</title><p>Serum-starved HEK293 cells were incubated with serum-free medium (&#x02212;), medium containing 10&#x00025; FBS (S), and serum-free medium containing &#x003b3;-radiation&#x02013;inactivated ZEBOV (E, MOI&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;5) or VSV (V, MOI&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;5) at 37&#x000b0;C for 30 or 60 min.

The assay, which was originally based on virus pseudotypes, measures release of a recombinant nef-luciferase protein, encapsulated within virus particles. The nef peptide serves to non-specifically target luciferase to cell membranes at the time of particle budding and so, incorporates luciferase within the membrane of new virus particles. After cell-virus membrane fusion, the luciferase becomes accessible to its substrates, previously loaded into cells, and light is emitted. Here the assay was adapted for use, first with ZEBOV GP pseudotyped particles and then with ZEBOV virus-like particles. Both types of virus particles give a measure of GP function but VLPs, which share a filamentous structure with native ZEBOV are likely a better model system for wild type virus. In either case, this is the first time that this assay technology has been adapted to ZEBOV.

To further define the mechanism by which PI3K controls ZEBOV entry, virus binding to cells was measured. Cells were pretreated with LY294002 or Akt-1 inhibitor and pseudotyped viruses were bound for 10 min. Unbound virus was then washed away and cells with residual bound particles were lysed using non-ionic detergent to release virus encapsulated luciferase. Compared to DMSO-treated (control) cells, no significant difference was observed in luciferase activity in samples that were treated with either LY294002 or Akt-1 inhibitor, indicating that ZEBOV pseudotype binding to cells was unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000141-g004">Figure 4E</xref>).

Thus, the present report is the first to show involvement of the PI3K-Akt pathway in entry of an enveloped virus.</p><p>The data obtained using the knockout cells provided information on which subtype of PI3K was important.

Entry inhibition was more pronounced in pik3R2 knockout cells than in the pik3R1 knockout cells. This was somewhat surprising given that p85&#x003b1; is a major PI3K regulatory subunit, and deletion of the pik3R1 gene has a greater phenotypic impact, including perinatal lethality of homozygous mice accompanied with extensive hepatocytic and brown fat necrosis, enlarged skeletal muscle fibers, calcification of cardiac tissue and impaired B-cell development and proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000141-Fruman1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000141-Fruman2">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>.

Individual disruption of pik3R1 or pik3R2 gene was insufficient to confer complete inhibition of ZEBOV entry and may be due to a partial redundancy in the function of each or that other PI3K isoforms may also be involved.</p><p>Given the relatively slow entry kinetics of ZEBOV, compared to VSV, the rapid phosphorylation of Akt by ZEBOV suggests that induction of the PI3K pathway may be related to a very early event in the entry process, such as receptor/co-receptor engagement.

It was suggested that these molecules serve to promote endocytosis of ZEBOV particles; however, the exact mechanism and downstream effectors remained unclear. Interestingly, the inhibition of PI3K or Akt caused virus particles to aberrantly accumulate within the cell cytoplasm. In many cell types tyro3 family members trigger PI3K activation, and physical association of PI3K with Axl, Dtk and Mer has also been demonstrated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000141-Hafizi1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. ZEBOV interaction with the tyro3 RTK may then directly or indirectly trigger activation of PI3K and downstream effectors leading to virus endocytosis. However, more detailed analyses are required to further test this model.</p><p>In further studying the mechanism of action, Rac1 was found to be an important downstream effector.

Indirect evidence suggesting that control of actin polymerization may be important for ZEBOV infection came from observations that: (i) internalized ZEBOV particles were in close proximity to actin bundles or filaments; (ii) inhibitors of PI3K, Akt and Rac1 all caused similar changes in F-actin characterized by loss of membrane ruffling and focal adhesions (data not shown); and (iii) agents that perturb actin dynamics significantly inhibit EVP entry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000141-Yonezawa1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Early activation of the PI3K-Akt pathway by ZEBOV may also have implications in pathogenesis of Ebola virus hemorrhagic fever. A profound inflammatory response is a key feature of the disease. Macrophages are among the primary targets of ZEBOV infection and respond by producing a number of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines including TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-6 and IL-8 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000141-Stroher1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>.

It follows that Ebola virus envelope proteins may play a vital role in the proinflammatory response induced during the infection.

ZEBOV-induced activation of the PI3K-Akt pathway could then directly contribute to the proinflammatory response. Another hallmark of ZEBOV infection is hemorrhage due to increased vascular permeability. Vascular dysregulation has been attributed to both direct invasion and replication of ZEBOV in vascular endothelial cells, and to action of ZEBOV-induced proinflammatory cytokines, especially TNF-&#x003b1;, on vascular endothelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000141-Hensley1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>.
