This clone recognized all melanoma cell lines tested and, to a lower extent, melanocytes, in the context of human histocompatibility leukocyte antigen A2 (HLA-A2), but it did not recognize other tumor cell types. The gene coding for the antigen recognized by this clone was identified by the screening of a melanoma complementary DNA expression library. This antigen is overexpressed in melanomas, compared with other cancer cell lines and healthy tissues, and was thus called <italic>melanoma-overexpressed antigen</italic> (<italic>meloe</italic>). Remarkably, the structure of <italic>meloe</italic> was unusual, with multiple short open reading frames (ORFs). The peptide recognized by the CTL clone was encoded by one of these ORFs, called MELOE-1. Using a specific HLA-A2/peptide tetramer, we showed a correlation between the infusion of TILs containing MELOE-1&#x02013;specific T cells and relapse prevention in HLA-A2 patients. Indeed, 5 out of 9 patients who did not relapse were infused with TILs that contained MELOE-1&#x02013;specific T cells, whereas 0 out of the 21 patients who relapsed was infused with such TIL-containing lymphocytes. Overall, our results suggest that this new antigen is involved in immunosurveillance and, thus, represents an attractive target for immunotherapy protocols of melanoma.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used: HDAC, histone deacetylase; meloe, melanoma-overexpressed antigen; ORF, open reading frame; qPCR, quantitative PCR; SNP, single nucleotide polymorphism; TIL, tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><p>In the last 20 yr, many human melanoma antigens recognized by T cells have been identified using various methods such as cDNA cloning, MHC-bound peptide purification, or T cell induction against candidate peptides or proteins. These antigens have been classified into several groups: melanocytic differentiation antigens (such as Melan-A/MART-1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>); cancer-germline antigens, shared by several tumors and male germline cells (such as MAGE antigens) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>); mutated antigens generated by genetic alterations (such as CDK4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>); antigens overexpressed in various tumor types (such as PRAME) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>); and antigens aberrantly expressed in tumors (such as NA17-A and NA88-A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>). However, despite their high number, the immunogenicity of these antigens has not been elucidated yet, with the exception of Melan-A/MART-1. Indeed, the immunogenicity of the Melan-A antigen in melanoma has been strongly suggested by the analysis of several active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>) and passive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>) immunotherapy protocols targeting this antigen. The identification of such tumor antigens with a documented immunogenic potential remains a major issue to address for future immunotherapy protocols.</p><p>To this aim, we studied tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) populations that had been infused to melanoma patients in an adjuvant setting between 1994 and 2006, and who are still relapse free (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>). We previously showed that the prevention of relapse was correlated with the infusion of tumor-specific T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>), and specifically for HLA-A&#x0002a;0201 patients, with the infusion of Melan-A&#x02013;specific TILs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>). Nonetheless, in several TIL populations infused to relapse-free patients, a significant fraction of tumor-specific TILs remains of unknown specificity. To fully characterize these tumor-specific TILs and to look for new tumor antigens involved in relapse prevention, we used a TIL population infused to patient M170 in 1998, who is still relapse free today (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>). This HLA-A2 TIL population contained a significant fraction of melanoma-reactive TILs, among which Melan-A/A2&#x02013;specific lymphocytes and lymphocytes of unknown specificity were present. In this study, we show that this TIL population contained tumor-reactive lymphocytes specific for a new tumor antigen overexpressed in melanomas, melanoma-overexpressed antigen 1 (MELOE-1), and recognized by autologous TILs in the HLA-A2 context. Our study clearly shows a correlation between the infusion of T cells reactive against this new tumor epitope and relapse prevention of TIL-treated patients. Thus, this new antigen represents an attractive target for immunotherapy protocols of melanoma.</p><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>T cell clone selection and characterization</title><p>The M170 TIL population contained 16% of melanoma-reactive lymphocytes, among which 5% were specific for the Melan-A/A2 epitope and 11% were of unknown specificity (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). This TIL population was then tested for recognition of a large panel of known antigens (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>) transfected into COS cells with the class I HLA molecules of patient M170 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>), and no response aside from the Melan-A/A2 response could be detected (unpublished data), suggesting that this population contained lymphocytes specific for new tumor antigens. To characterize them, we derived tumor-reactive CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell clones by limiting dilution. Eight of these CTL clones showed reactivity patterns consistent with the recognition of new antigens, and one of them, hereafter referred to as M170.48, was further characterized to determine the HLA context restricting its recognition. As illustrated by <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>, the recognition of the autologous melanoma cell line occurs in the HLA-A2 context. To establish the distribution of the target antigen, we tested M170.48 reactivity toward various HLA-A2 tumor cell lines, including melanomas, ovarian carcinomas, lung carcinomas, breast carcinomas, renal carcinomas, and colon carcinomas, using a TNF release assay. As shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>, this T cell clone recognized all of the HLA-A2 melanoma cell lines tested but none of the other HLA-A2 tumor cell types. In addition, the M170.48 T cell clone weakly recognized HLA-A2 melanocytes (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>). However, this reactivity was much lower than that seen with a Melan-A/A2&#x02013;specific T cell clone (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>, hatched bars).</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>T cell clone selection and characterization.</bold> (A) Percentage of TNF-producing T cells and of HLA-A2/Melan-A<sub>A27L</sub> tetramer&#x02013;positive T cells in the M170 TIL population in response to the autologous melanoma cell line. 10<sup>5</sup> TILs and 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> melanoma cells were incubated for 5 h in the presence of Brefeldin A, stained with HLA-A2/Melan-A<sub>A27L</sub> tetramer, fixed, and stained with anti-TNF antibody in a permeabilization buffer. 10<sup>4</sup> T cells were then analyzed by flow cytometry.

to characterize the antigen recognized by the M170.48 T cell clone. Among 800 pools of 100 pcDNA tested, one plasmid pool proved positive in this test, and the individual plasmid coding for the recognized antigen was recovered from it after a cloning step. This insert, namely <italic>meloe</italic>, spanning 2,128 bp, was sequenced and was found to contain a poly(A) tail and to be similar to the clone BC008026 isolated by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Mammalian Gene Collection consortium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>). After expression vector cloning, cotransfection of BC008026 cDNA with HLA A&#x0002a;0201 into COS-7 cells also induced the recognition by the M170.48 T cell clone (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>), although these two sequences differed by four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs; <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>). To control the impact of these SNPs on the recognition of the M170.48 T cell clone, we sequenced the cDNA isolated from recognized (M134 and M117) and nonrecognized cell lines (A498 and SW480), and showed that this polymorphism did not affect tumor cell line recognition. The <italic>meloe</italic> sequence analysis showed a perfect colinearity with the genomic DNA, obtained by comparison with the sequence of the human genome released by Celera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>), which indicated absence of splicing. Finally, this sequence was found to be located in the third intron of the histone deacetylase (HDAC) 4 gene (Ensembl accession no.

This ORF encodes a 46&#x02013;amino acid protein that contains two peptides (positions 16&#x02013;24 and 36&#x02013;44 on the protein sequence) able to bind to the HLA A&#x0002a;0201, with a high stability as predicted by BioInformatics and Molecular Analysis Section analysis (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www-bimas.cit.nih.gov">http://www-bimas.cit.nih.gov</ext-link>; <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>). These two nonapeptides were tested for their recognition by the M170.48 T cell clone after loading onto T2 cells. Only the sequence 36&#x02013;44 (TLNDECWPA) was recognized (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 D</xref> and not depicted). We then tested the recognition of two additional peptides derived from this nonapeptide. We observed that addition of the serine at the C terminus (position 45) dramatically decreased the response of our CTL clone (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 D</xref>, closed circles) and that deletion of the alanine at the C-terminal end (position 44) abrogated the CTL clone response (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 D</xref>, open circles).

The mean level of <italic>meloe</italic> expression in two HLA-A2 melanocytes was used as a reference to establish its relative expression in other cell lines. This analysis showed that <italic>meloe</italic> expression in melanomas was higher than in melanocytes, with values ranging from 3- to 34-fold higher, whereas this expression was significantly lower in other tumor cell lines, with values ranging from 5- to 338-fold lower (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>). These results show that this antigen is overexpressed in melanomas, and thus, the protein encoded by the ORF 1,230&#x02013;1,370 was called MELOE-1. Furthermore, transfection of <italic>meloe</italic> or <italic>meloe-1</italic> cDNA in HLA-A2 nonrecognized tumor cell lines induced their recognition by the M170.48 T cell clone (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref>), showing that the absence of recognition of these tumor cell lines was caused by the underexpression of <italic>meloe</italic> cDNA. Finally, to address the question of the expression of this antigen in healthy tissues, we performed qPCR on a panel of 16 tissues. It appears that the expression of <italic>meloe</italic> in healthy tissues was always lower than in melanocytes. The highest <italic>meloe</italic> expression was found in the whole and fetal brain but remained, respectively, 1.5- and 1.8-fold below its expression in melanocytes (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 C</xref>).

All of those TIL populations had been infused to melanoma patients in an adjuvant setting between the years 1998 and 2002. After this treatment, 21 of these patients relapsed and 9 remained relapse free. Using a specific HLA/peptide tetramer, we detected the presence of MELOE-1/A2&#x02013;specific T cells in five out of nine TIL populations that had been infused to relapse-free patients, with frequencies ranging from 0.07 to 3.8% among CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> TILs (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 A</xref>, top).

These results document the existence of a correlation between the presence of MELOE-1&#x02013;specific lymphocytes among infused TILs and relapse prevention (P &#x0003c; 0.001), and thus, suggest the potential immunogenicity of this new HLA-A2 melanoma epitope.</p><fig position="float" id="fig5"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p><bold>Detection of MELOE-1/A2&#x02013;specific CTLs in TILs infused to relapse-free melanoma patients and analysis of their repertoire diversity.</bold> (A) HLA-A2 TIL populations labeled with the A2/MELOE-1<sub>36-44</sub> tetramer.

We also attempted to sort five negative TIL populations with monomer-coated beads, but no MELOE-1&#x02013;specific cells were obtained (unpublished data). This last result formally documented the absence of such cells in those populations, or at least showed that the frequencies of MELOE-1&#x02013;specific T cells were too low to allow their purification by multimer sorting. The diversity of TCR V&#x003b2; usage of sorted populations was assessed with a panel of 25 anti-V&#x003b2; antibodies representing the most frequently expressed V&#x003b2; chains within a normal repertoire. In M117, M170, and M278 sorted populations, eight or six different V&#x003b2; chains were significantly expressed (&#x0003e;1%) by MELOE-1/A2&#x02013;specific TILs, indicating the presence of a rather polyclonal-specific TCR repertoire (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 B</xref>). TCR diversity of M134 sorted TILs was much lower, with a strong dominance of lymphocytes expressing the V&#x003b2;13.1 chain (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 B</xref>). This may be related to the low fraction of MELOE-1&#x02013;specific T cells present in this population before sorting (0.3% of CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> TILs; <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 A</xref>), which was probably poorly diverse. Finally, we could not determine the dominant V&#x003b2; chain expressed by TILs sorted from M180 with our panel of antibodies. Therefore, no dominant V&#x003b2; usage could be observed within these three sorted TIL populations. Finally, to support the potential role of MELOE-1/A2&#x02013;specific TIL transfer in relapse prevention, we studied the reactivity of sorted TIL populations on HLA-A&#x0002a;0201 melanoma cell lines that spontaneously express the MELOE-1 antigen. All sorted T cell lines were lytic against melanoma cell lines (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 A</xref> and not depicted) and produced IFN-&#x003b3; and TNF upon stimulation by these cells, with levels similar to the M170.48 CTL clone, and to a lower extent IL-2 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 B</xref> and not depicted).</p><fig position="float" id="fig6"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><p><bold>Reactivity of MELOE-1/A2&#x02013;specific TILs against HLA-A2 tumor cell lines.</bold> (A) Lysis of the M170 melanoma cell line (closed circles) and of the 1355 lung carcinoma cell line (open circles) by the M170.48 CTL clone and MELOE-1&#x02013;specific TIL populations. <sup>51</sup>Cr-labeled tumor cells were co-cultured with T cells at various E/T ratios.

There is a perfect colinearity between the <italic>meloe</italic> gene and its corresponding cDNA, showing an absence of splicing of this gene. Furthermore, the structure of this 2.1-kb cDNA is rather unusual, with multiple short ORFs instead of a unique long ORF. The protein encoded by the ORF<sub>1230-1370</sub> (MELOE-1) contains a peptide that was recognized by a CTL clone derived from melanoma-specific TILs, in the HLA-A&#x0002a;0201 context. This CTL clone recognized all of the HLA-A&#x0002a;0201 melanoma cell lines tested, and to a lower extent HLA-A&#x0002a;0201 melanocytes. On the other hand, this T cell clone failed to recognize any of the other tumor cell lines tested (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>). Moreover, another epitope derived from the protein encoded by an alternative ORF, also recognized in the HLA-A&#x0002a;0201 context by a CTL clone deriving from the same TIL population, is under characterization. This suggests that <italic>meloe</italic> could be an interesting source of tumor epitopes recognized by melanoma TILs.</p><p>The <italic>meloe</italic> antigen could be classified into the family of &#x0201c;melanocytic differentiation antigens&#x0201d; because of its expression in melanocytes and melanoma cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>). Nonetheless, it could be also classified into the family of aberrantly expressed antigens because of the particular location of <italic>meloe</italic> gene in the third intron of the HDAC-4 gene, according to the example of NA17-A antigen, located in an intron of the GnT-V gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>). Unlike classical differentiation antigens such as Melan-A or tyrosinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>), we detected by qPCR a residual expression of the <italic>meloe</italic> gene in other cancer cell lines, even if this expression level was too low to induce their recognition by our specific CTL clone, as recently shown for a mouse prostate tumor epitope derived from histone H4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>). <italic>meloe</italic> also differs from a classical differentiation antigen by its overexpression in melanomas, compared with normal melanocytes. Thus, <italic>meloe</italic> seems to be specifically overexpressed in melanomas, and therefore, this new antigen presents both the properties of tissue specificity and overexpression in cancer. The reasons for its overexpression in melanomas could be because of the regulation of <italic>meloe</italic> promoter. As described for the MAGE-1 gene, a transient and general process of demethylation in tumors could be followed by a persistent inhibition of remethylation caused by the presence of melanoma-specific transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>). In this way, <italic>meloe</italic> overexpression in melanomas could be caused by the hypomethylation of its promoter in melanoma cell lines. In another way, melanoma-specific transcription factors, such as microphthalmia-associated transcription factor, which controls the expression of the three main melanocytic differentiation antigens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>), could also control the overexpression of <italic>meloe</italic> in melanomas.</p><p>Because of its expression widely shared by melanoma cell lines, and to the existence of an epitope recognized by a melanoma-reactive CTL in the HLA-A&#x0002a;0201 context, the MELOE-1 antigen could be a promising target for future immunotherapy protocols of melanoma, provided that its usage remains safe in patients and that its immunogenicity could be documented.</p><p>Our data provide some arguments concerning the safety of immunization of patients with this antigen or of adoptive transfer with specific CTLs. Indeed, the expression level of <italic>meloe</italic> in healthy tissues is always lower than in melanocytes, which are weakly recognized by the MELOE-1&#x02013;specific CTL clone to a lower extent than by Melan-A&#x02013;specific CTLs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1 D</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4 C</xref>). Furthermore, none of the other HLA-A&#x0002a;0201 cancer cell lines was able to spontaneously induce any reactivity of the MELOE-1&#x02013;specific CTLs (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>), even after a 48-h treatment with IFN-&#x003b3; (not depicted). MELOE-1&#x02013;specific CTL clones could only be activated by such tumor cell lines when they were previously transfected by the <italic>meloe</italic> cDNA or the cDNA coding for ORF<sub>1230-1370</sub> (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref>), showing that the expression level of <italic>meloe</italic> in other cancer cell lines was too low to induce the activation of specific lymphocytes. This expression level is similar to that measured in healthy tissues by qPCR (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 C</xref>), suggesting that an immunization with this antigen should not induce deleterious reactions in healthy tissues, although we could expect the induction of some vitiligo because of the expression of <italic>meloe</italic> in melanocytes.</p><p>The second point concerns the immunogenicity of this new antigen and especially the immunogenicity of the HLA-A&#x0002a;0201&#x02013;restricted epitope. To answer this main question, we checked the presence of MELOE-1&#x02013;specific lymphocytes among TIL populations, which had been infused to stage III melanoma patients after lymph node excision, in an adjuvant setting. In retrospective studies of this adoptive transfer protocol, we already showed that the infusion of melanoma-specific TILs had a significant impact on the relapse prevention of treated patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>). More recently, we found that prolonged relapse-free survival of TIL-treated patients correlated with the infusion of Melan-A&#x02013;specific lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>), although a significant fraction of tumor-specific TILs remains of unknown specificity in several TIL populations infused to relapse-free patients. We detected a significant fraction of MELOE-1&#x02013;specific lymphocytes, by tetramer labeling, in 5 out of 9 TIL populations infused to HLA-A2 patients who remained relapse free from 7 to 13 yr, whereas no MELOE-1&#x02013;specific lymphocytes could be observed in 21 TIL populations infused to patients who relapsed. The statistical analysis of these results performed by a &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test documents a correlation between the prevention of the relapse of TIL-treated HLA-A2 patients and the presence of MELOE-1&#x02013;specific CTLs among those TILs (P &#x0003c; 0.001). This main result provides a strong argument in favor of the implication of MELOE-1 antigen in the immunosurveillance of patients treated by adoptive transfer of TILs. This role in immunosurveillance has not been formally elucidated for the majority of melanoma antigens identified, except for Melan-A/MART-1, which seems clearly involved in clinical responses of melanoma patients treated by immunotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>).</p><p>According to the example of Melan-A antigen, a diverse and tumor-reactive T cell repertoire is necessary to develop protocols of adoptive transfer of specific T cells in melanoma patients, as well as for vaccination trials. We addressed this last issue by analyzing the diversity and reactivity of an MELOE-1&#x02013;specific repertoire in the five TIL populations that contained MELOE-1&#x02013;specific T cells. After the selection of MELOE-1&#x02013;specific T cells from TILs by immunomagnetic sorting with multimer-coated beads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>), we showed that the MELOE-1&#x02013;specific repertoire was diverse in three out of five TIL populations and much more limited for the M134 TIL population, which contained a low fraction of MELOE-1&#x02013;specific T cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, A and B</xref>), which could explain this poorer diversity. We could not determined the dominant V&#x003b2; chains expressed by M180 sorted TILs with our panel of antibodies (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 B</xref>). The repertoire analysis of these TIL populations did not reveal any recurrence of a particular V&#x003b2; usage, as previously described for the Melan-A&#x02013;specific repertoire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>). These five MELOE-1&#x02013;specific TIL populations were as reactive as the M170.48-specific T cell clone against HLA-A2 melanoma cell lines, as shown by lysis (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6 A</xref>) and IFN-&#x003b3; and TNF-&#x003b1; production in response to melanoma cells, and, to a lower extent, IL-2 production. Furthermore, we recently demonstrated that MELOE-1&#x02013;specific T cells could be also selected and amplified from the PBMCs of melanoma patients (unpublished data), which remain the most convenient source of tumor-specific T cells usable for all HLA-A2 patients enrolled in adoptive transfer protocols.</p><p>In conclusion, this new melanoma antigen, <italic>meloe</italic>, appears to be a very relevant target for immunotherapy protocols. Its overexpression by all melanoma cell lines tested, the particular structure of the transcript with multiple ORFs, its potential as a source of class I and II epitopes, the characterization of an epitope derived from one of these ORFs and recognized in the frequently expressed HLA-A2 context, and, finally, its implication in the immunosurveillance of TIL-treated HLA-A2 melanoma patients are convincing arguments to use this antigen in vaccination trials or to target it by the adoptive transfer of specific T cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>Cell lines and TIL cultures.</title><p>20 T cell populations were expanded from cryopreserved samples of TILs (derived from tumor-invaded lymph nodes) infused to melanoma patients included in a phase I/II protocol between the years 1994 and 1998.
