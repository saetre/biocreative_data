During murine embryogenesis, <italic>sik1</italic> marks the monolayer of future myocardial cells that will populate first the primitive ventricle, and later the primitive atrium suggesting its involvement in cardiac cell differentiation and/or heart development. Despite that observation, the involvement of <italic>sik1</italic> in cardiac differentiation is still unknown. We examined the sik1 function during cardiomyocyte differentiation using the ES-derived embryoid bodies. We produced a null embryonic stem cell using a gene-trap cell line carrying an insertion in the <italic>sik1</italic> locus. In absence of the sik1 protein, the temporal appearance of cardiomyocytes is delayed. Expression profile analysis revealed <italic>sik1</italic> as part of a genetic network that controls the cell cycle, where the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p57<sup>Kip2</sup> is directly involved. Collectively, we provided evidence that sik1-mediated effects are specific for cardiomyogenesis regulating cardiomyoblast cell cycle exit toward terminal differentiation.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The formation of the heart involves a precisely orchestrated series of molecular and morphogenetic events, and even a subtle perturbation of this process can have catastrophic consequences for cardiac function.
