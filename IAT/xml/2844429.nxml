Ozz is a developmentally regulated protein that functions as the adaptor component of a RING-type ubiquitin ligase complex specific to striated muscle. <italic>Ozz<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mutants exhibit defects in myofibrillogenesis and myofiber differentiation. Here we show that Ozz targets the rod portion of embryonic myosin heavy chain and preferentially recognizes the sarcomeric rather than the soluble pool of myosin. We present evidence that Ozz binding to the embryonic myosin isoform within sarcomeric thick filaments marks it for ubiquitination and proteolytic degradation, allowing its replacement with neonatal or adult isoforms. This unique function positions Ozz within a system that facilitates sarcomeric myosin remodeling during muscle maturation and regeneration. Our findings identify Ozz-E3 as the ubiquitin ligase complex that interacts with and regulates myosin within its fully assembled cytoskeletal structure.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Striated muscle cells exhibit the paradoxical association of a rigidly ordered fine structure with the ability to adapt their size and contractile properties during growth and development, or in response to changes in their patterns of use. Many sarcomeric proteins are developmentally expressed as a series of isoforms leading at maturation to patterns appropriate for slow or fast contraction, and aerobic or anaerobic metabolism. Accordingly, mechanisms must exist to enable replacement of isoforms while maintaining an almost crystalline regularity of structural pattern.

This alternative model implies that, in contrast with the action of one-chain ligases, Ozz does not immediately initiate ubiquitination and proteolytic degradation but may have a chaperone-like function in a preassembled form and only subsequently may gather the rest of the complex and become an active ligase. This two-step mode of action of the Ozz-E3 may explain the timely and regulated replacement/exchange of myofilamentous myosin during muscle differentiation and regeneration. This model of regulated assembly and disassembly of MyHC could be envisaged also for the adult muscle, where Ozz is expressed at basal levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009866-Nastasi1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. In the adult muscle the Ozz-E3 activity would ensure the maintenance of myofiber integrity and the regulated exchange of isoforms under stress fiber conditions.</p><p>Modulation of cell structure by disaggregation and reassembly of cytoskeletal subunits is common to all cells, as is ubiquitination of many of the signaling proteins that control this process. The ubiquitin system also regulates signaling proteins controlling cell metabolism, cell cycle, and ion channel turnover, and is involved in chaperone-mediated myosin assembly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009866-Hoppe1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009866-Du1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. It has a prominent role in recognizing misplaced or damaged proteins and promoting their degradation, and has a particular association with muscle atrophy. However, Ozz is upregulated during development, growth and regeneration, and downregulated in atrophy, and represents to our knowledge the first E3 ligase to be described as having a role in targeting myosin in its fully assembled sarcomeric structure during muscle remodeling. The Ozz model may be a paradigm for other developmental systems requiring protein isoform exchange within complex cytoskeletal structures.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Yeast Two-Hybrid Screening</title><p>Screening of an E14.5 mouse cDNA library (gift of P.

Pearson's correlation coefficient (Rr), Manders overlap (R), and Manders overlap coefficients <italic>k1</italic> and <italic>k2</italic> were employed to evaluate the extent of co-localization of the two fluorescent dyes. Pearson's correlation coefficient (Rr) is one of the standard measures in pattern recognition. It is used for describing the correlation of the intensity distributions between channels. It takes into consideration only similarity between shapes while ignoring the intensities of signals. Its values range is between -1.0 and 1.0, where 1.0 indicates no overlap and 1.0 is a complete co-localization. Manders overlap coefficient is a generally accepted measure of co-localization. It indicates an overlap of the signals and thus represents the true degree of co-localization. Values of the R are defined from 0 to 1.0. If an image has an overlap coefficient equal to 0.5, it implies that 50&#x00025; of both its components overlap with the other part of the image. A value of zero means that there are no any overlapping objects Overlap coefficients <italic>k1</italic> and k<italic>2</italic> split the value of co-localization into two separate parameters. <italic>k1</italic> and k<italic>2</italic> coefficients depend on the sum of the products of the intensities of two channels.
