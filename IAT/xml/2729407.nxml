HIPK2 is also a transcriptional co-repressor of hypoxia-inducible factor-1&#x003b1; (HIF-1&#x003b1;) restraining tumor angiogenesis and chemoresistance. HIPK2 can be deregulated in tumors by several mechanisms including hypoxia. Here, we sought to target hypoxia by restoring HIPK2 function and suppressing HIF-1&#x003b1;, in order to provide evidence for the involvement of both HIPK2 and p53 in counteracting hypoxia-induced chemoresistance.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>Upon exposure of colon and lung cancer cells to hypoxia, by either low oxygen or cobalt, HIPK2 function was impaired allowing for increased HIF-1&#x003b1; expression and inhibiting the p53-apoptotic response to drug. Cobalt suppressed HIPK2 recruitment onto HIF-1&#x003b1; promoter. Hypoxia induced expression of the p53 target MDM2 that downregulates HIPK2, thus MDM2 inhibition by siRNA restored the HIPK2/p53Ser46 response to drug. Zinc supplementation to hypoxia-treated cells increased HIPK2 protein stability and nuclear accumulation, leading to restoration of HIPK2 binding to HIF-1&#x003b1; promoter, repression of MDR1, Bcl2, and VEGF genes, and activation of the p53 apoptotic response to drug.

Moreover, hypoxia attenuates the response of oncosuppressor p53 to cellular damage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006819-Achison1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. The p53 protein plays important roles in growth arrest, cellular repair, and cell death, which minimize the propagation of malignant cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006819-Vousden1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. The function of p53 as a tumor suppressor is linked to its activity as a transcription factor through posttranslational modifications that allow the protein to escape MDM2 control, accumulate, and become active <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006819-Sakaguchi1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. The p53 gene is mutated in &#x0223c;50&#x00025; of human cancers whereas, in cancers harbouring wild-type (wtp53), its activity may be compromised by other mechanisms including deregulation of regulatory proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006819-Hollstein1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006819-Vousden2">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Homeodomain-interacting protein kinase-2 (HIPK2) is an important regulator of p53 apoptotic function, thus we have previously shown that HIPK2 phosphorylates p53 at serine 46 (Ser46) after severe DNA damage, inducing p53 specific apoptotic transcriptional activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006819-DOrazi1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006819-Pistritto1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Phosphorylation at this site is a late event after severe DNA damage and specifically regulates p53-induced apoptosis through for instance upregulation of p53AIP1 gene instead of cell-cycle arrested related gene and MDM2 gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006819-Oda1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006819-Mayo1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. A major auto-regulatory, negative feed-back loop of p53 involves p53-dependent MDM2 induction that in turn binds and inactivates p53 by driving it to proteasomal degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006819-Momand1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006819-Kubbutat1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. In this regard, we have shown that HIPK2 neutralizes MDM2 inhibition rescuing p53 transcriptional activity and apoptotic function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006819-DiStefano2">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, agents such as HIPK2 that can increase active p53 in tumor cells by hinder the MDM2-p53 interaction might have therapeutic utility in sensitizing tumor cells to chemo- or radio-therapy.</p><p>HIPK2 is also a transcriptional co-repressor often in multiprotein complex with other co-repressors such as Groucho and hystone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006819-Choi1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. We recently found that HIPK2 co-represses the hypoxia-inducible factor-1&#x003b1; (HIF-1&#x003b1;) transcription factor restraining HIF-1-induced tumor angiogenesis and chemoresistance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006819-Nardinocchi1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, inhibition of HIF-1&#x003b1; activity by HIPK2 reduces VEGF, MDR1, and Bcl2 expression and stimulates drug-induced apoptosis in p53-dependent and-independent ways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006819-Nardinocchi2">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Given its central role in the targeting of cells towards apoptosis upon genotoxic stress, the regulation of HIPK2 has been the subject to intense investigation in the last years. HIPK2 was found downmodulated in thyroid, breast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006819-Pierantoni1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref> and colon cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006819-DOrazi2">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref> in comparison to the respective normal tissues; mutated within the speckle retention signal in human acute myeloblastic leukemias and in myelodysplastic syndrome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006819-Li1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>; and delocalized in the cytoplasm by high-mobility group A1 (HMGA1) overexpression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006819-Pierantoni2">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. HIPK2 is an unstable protein that is degraded via the proteasome pathway in particular recent studies showed that HIPK2 can be downmodulated by p53-induced MDM2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006819-Rinaldo1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref> and by hypoxia-induced Siah2 proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006819-Calzado1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. We have recently shown that HIPK2 knockdown induces p53 misfolding that can be reverted by zinc supplementation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006819-Puca1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006819-Puca2">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, all the conditions that lead to HIPK2 deregulation would end in a multifactorial response leading to tumor chemoresistance by strongly affecting p53 transcriptional activity and apoptosis on one hand and HIF-1 activity on the other hand. Hence, an understanding of how downregulated HIPK2 could be reactivated might lead to new strategies to both restrain HIF-1 pathway and re-establish p53 activity to overcome drug resistance. This is also in line with recent works that have shown that treatment of cancer by anti-angiogenic agents may result in hypoxia that selects for radio and drug resistance, underscoring the need to address tumor hypoxia in cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006819-Loges1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Zinc is an important cofactor for DNA-binding activity of p53, as some p53 mutations that perturb the zinc-binding site in p53 result in the loss of DNA binding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006819-Joenger1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. Zinc is a trace element that is essential for the normal function of cells and is a cofactor for the structure and function of a wide range of cellular proteins including enzymes, transcription factors, and structural proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006819-Beyersmann1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus zinc is an essential prerequisite for the progress of many signalling processes in eukaryotes and deregulation of its metabolism can induce DNA damage and cancer risk <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006819-Ho1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. Treatment with zinc was shown to have real clinic potential, reducing tumor growth and aggressiveness with limited biotoxicity, for instance in prostate cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006819-Shah1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The purpose of our investigation was to evaluate whether hypoxia could deregulate the HIPK2-induced p53 dependent apoptotic transcriptional activity in response to drug and therefore contribute to chemoresistance and whether zinc could counteract this HIPK2/p53Ser46 inhibition. We found that exposure of tumor cells to hypoxia, by either low oxygen or cobalt, inhibited p53Ser46 phosphorylation and p53 apoptotic transcriptional activity in response to drug. This inhibition was the consequence of HIPK2 downregulation due, at least in part, to hypoxia-induced MDM2 upregulation. On the other hand, cobalt inhibited HIPK2 recruitment onto HIF-1&#x003b1; promoter. Notably, zinc supplementation to hypoxia-treated cells counteracted the inhibition of HIPK2 allowing its nuclear accumulation that correlated with HIF-1&#x003b1; downmodulation and repression of the HIF-1 pathway and with restoration of p53Ser46 apoptotic transcriptional activity in response to drug. Altogether, these results show that hypoxia-condition can affect the HIPK2/p53Ser46 pathway, notably we show here for the first time that zinc can neutralize the hypoxia-induced HIPK2 inhibition. Since tumors contain regions with hypoxic conditions where wtp53 is inactive, these results support the potential use of zinc supplementation to chemotherapy in treatment of tumors with non functioning wtp53 or HIPK2.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Cell exposure to cobalt abrogates the p53 apoptotic-gene transcription and reduces HIPK2 recruitment onto HIF-1&#x003b1; promoter</title><p>We asked whether cobalt chloride (CoCl<sub>2</sub>), that stabilizes HIF-1&#x003b1; and induces HIF-1 responsive genes with kinetics similar to that of hypoxia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006819-Wang1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>, could affect drug-induced p53 apoptotic gene transcription.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006819-g002">Figure 2A</xref>, cobalt downregulated HIPK2 protein levels that could be rescued by MG132 treatment.

We reasoned that by keeping HIPK2 protein levels low, cobalt could influence HIPK2 recruitment onto target promoters, thereby affecting HIPK2 co-repressor activity. In support of this hypothesis, we performed ChIP assay whereas chromatin immunocomplexes were immunoprecipitated with anti-HIPK2 and anti-Histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) antibodies and PCR analysis performed using specific primers flanking the HIF-1&#x003b1; promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006819-Nardinocchi1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>.

Hence, we asked whether hypoxia could act as non-severe stress able to activate p53-target MDM2 and consequently inhibit HIPK2 and predispose to drug resistance. Semiquantitative RT-PCR analyses showed that cobalt as well as low oxygen induced MDM2 upregulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006819-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Next, we investigated whether MDM2 was responsible for inhibition of p53 apoptotic activity. Analysis of p53 transcriptional activity following cobalt treatment was performed in 293 cells co-transfected with the p53AIP1-luc reporter and either HIPK2-Flag or the HIPK2-K1182R-Flag point mutant that cannot be degraded by MDM2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006819-Rinaldo1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>.

Western immunoblotting showed that HIPK2 expression was reduced by cobalt while the expression of the degradation-resistant K1182 mutant was not affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006819-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). In agreement, also the HIPK2-induced Ser46 phosphorylation was reduced by cobalt, while it did not change following K1182 overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006819-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). Both results suggested an involvement of MDM2 in HIPK2 regulation that in turn affected p53Ser46 activity. To test this hypothesis, RKO cells were depleted of the MDM2 function by siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006819-g003">Figure 3D</xref>) and this MDM2 depletion was sufficient to rescue ADR-induced Ser46 phosphorylation and PARP cleavage inhibited by cobalt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006819-g003">Figure 3E</xref> and compare with 1A).

The mechanistic explanation of hypoxia-induced chemoresistance involved upregulation of HIF-1 pathway and inhibition of the p53 pathway that were partly interconnected by the hypoxia-induced HIPK2 deregulation. Thus, in our cell lines, hypoxia, by inducing p53 target MDM2 could downregulate HIPK2 leading on the one hand to de-repression of the HIF-1&#x003b1; activity and on the other hand to inhibition of p53 apoptotic activity in response to drug. Of note, HIPK2 catalytic activity did not change after cobalt treatment, therefore suggesting that HIPK2 nuclear disappearance is the major reason of HIPK2 deregulation, at least in our experimental condition. Indeed, lack of HIPK2 nuclear accumulation during hypoxia, as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006819-g005">Figure 5B</xref>, and likely of interaction with other proteins, can mechanistically explain inhibition of HIPK2 co-repressor function on DNA, nonetheless HIPK2 keeps its kinase activity. Interestingly, we provided evidence here for the first time that zinc counteracted the hypoxia-induced HIPK2 downregulation and re-established HIPK2 recruitment to HIF-1&#x003b1; promoter with repression of HIF-1 target genes; notably, zinc restored p53/Ser46 apoptotic response to drug inhibited by hypoxia.

There is a growing interest in the therapeutic possibilities of reactivating dysfunctional p53 in cancers in order to halt tumor growth. Obviously this requires understanding how p53 function was lost in the first place as p53 can be either mutated or deregulated by alteration of regulatory proteins.

A high level of HIF-1&#x003b1; is associated with pro-survival of the cancer cell, increased tumor angiogenesis, invasiveness, and resistance to conventional treatments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006819-Semenza1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006819-Wang1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. HIF-1&#x003b1; is mostly regulated at posttranscriptional levels by low oxygen condition, however we found that HIPK2 can transcriptionally regulate HIF-1&#x003b1; gene independently of the oxygen condition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006819-Nardinocchi1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, HIPK2 inhibition by RNA interference induces HIF-1&#x003b1; up-regulation and tumor angiogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006819-Nardinocchi1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. On the other hand, inhibition of HIF-1&#x003b1; activity by HIPK2 reduces VEGF, MDR1, and Bcl2 expression and stimulates drug-induced apoptosis in p53-dependent and-independent ways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006819-Nardinocchi2">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, providing a rationale for the potential use of HIPK2 transduction or restoration of HIPK2 function to inhibit HIF-1 pathway and sensitize chemoresistant tumor cells to drugs. To the best of our knowledge, our finding that zinc might counteract the hypoxia-induced HIPK2 downregulation is the first attempt to try to restore HIPK2 activity, although the exact mechanism that leads to recovery of HIPK2 function by zinc remains to be elucidated. Zinc is a cofactor for the structure and function of a wide range of cellular enzymes, transcription factors including p53, zinc fingers and structural proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006819-Beyersmann1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. We hypothesize that zinc might stabilize HIPK2 counteracting the MDM2- or hypoxia-dependent HIPK2 proteasomal degradation and increase HIPK2 sumoylation and transcriptional repressor function. In this regard, SUMO has been shown to act as antagonist of ubiquitination and have a role in the negative regulation of transcription, hence, sumoylation might block alternative lysine-targeted modifications such as acetylation or ubiquitination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006819-Verger1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. HIPK2 harbours a SUMO-interaction motif in its C-terminus that might affect its intramolecular conformation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006819-Gresko2">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>, and SUMO modification of HIPK2 has been shown to enhances it corepressor activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006819-Roscic1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. In agreement with these studies we found that zinc could increase HIPK2 nuclear accumulation and recruitment onto HIF-1&#x003b1; promoter, inhibited by hypoxia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006819-g005">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p>Zinc restores p53 function in HIPK2 depleted cells, as previously reported by our studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006819-Puca1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006819-Puca2">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, but can also affect HIPK2 function, as suggested by this study, and therefore be used as HIF-1&#x003b1;-targeting approach rendering the chemotherapeutic treatment of tumors more effective. Very few studies report the use of zinc in combination with chemotherapy, in fact as far as we know, zinc is not administered as part of any modern chemotherapy program in the treatment of cancer. It was shown that treatment with zinc alone can have real clinic potential, reducing tumor growth and aggressiveness with limited biotoxicity, for instance in prostate cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006819-Shah1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, one medical hypothesis reported that zinc adjuvant can accelerate recovery from acute lymphocytic leukaemia (ALL), and in conjunction with chemotherapy, cure ALL <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006819-Eby1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, whether zinc supplementation can aid in stimulating T-cell system to fight off tumors, as suggested by Eby's hypothesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006819-Eby1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref> or whether it can affect gene expression pathways, such as HIF-1 and p53 pathways, to improve tumor response to drugs is a fascinating research field in cancer therapy that deserves further studies. Moreover, our preclinical finding of zinc and drug combination therapy for maximal therapeutic response of cancer cells to drugs might be of general importance in light of recent work showing that treatment of cancer by anti-angiogenic agents like anti VEGFR or small molecule inhibitors of tyrosine kinase may result in hypoxia that selects for more malignant metastatic and invasive cells, that eventually lead the tumors to relapse as a more invasive and metastatic disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006819-PaezRibes1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006819-Ebos1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>. Similar results may apply also for the treatment with antibodies when the signaling pathway triggered by the antibody affects the HIF 1 pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006819-Li2">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>. Hence, the more proficient an antiangiogenic agent is, the more efficiently it will cause hypoxia and unlike normal cells, tumor cells are much better equipped to cope with hypoxia. These surprising new results call upon new methods for targeting the hypoxia pathway in combination with the anti-angiogenic targeting drug. Thus, targeting HIF-1 is expected to synergize with the anti-angiogenesis treatment and other treatments that promote hypoxia and restore sensitivity to drugs. Our result provides a new answer to this surprising undesirable effect of the hypoxia on the final outcome of cancer in treated patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cell lines and treatments</title><p>RKO human colon carcinoma, RKO-HIPK2-depleted <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006819-DiStefano1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, RKO-AIP1-luc (stable transfected with p53AIP1-luc vector) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006819-DiStefano3">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref> and A549 human lung cancer cells were maintained in RPMI-1640 (Life Technology-Invitrogen) and human embryo kidney 293 cells were maintained in DMEM (Life Technology-Invitrogen), supplemented with 10&#x00025; heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum plus glutamine and antibiotics in humidified atmosphere with 5&#x00025; CO<sub>2</sub> at 37&#x000b0;C.</p><p>For treatments, zinc chloride (ZnCl<sub>2</sub>) and Adriamycin (ADR) were added to the culture medium to a final concentration of respectively 100 &#x000b5;mol/L and 1.5 &#x000b5;g/mL for the indicated period; hypoxia condition was obtained by adding cobalt chloride (CoCl<sub>2</sub>) into the culture medium to a final concentration of 200 &#x000b5;mol/L for the indicated time or by exposing cell culture to 2&#x00025; oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) for 16 h.
