In particular, TG cells have the ability to take up extracellular antigens by active phagocytosis induced by interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). We previously reported that heat shock cognate protein 70 (Hsc70) present on the surface of TG cells mediated the uptake of Brucella abortus. However, the mechanism of bacterial uptake by TG cells is not completely understood.

In particular, TG cells play a crucial role in implantation and forming a diffuse network of blood sinuses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], and promote maternal blood flow to the implantation site in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. TG cells are essential for establishment of pregnancy. We previously reported that <italic>Brucella abortus</italic>, an intracellular bacteria that causes abortion in pregnant animals, internalized and replicated in TG cells, specifically in pregnant mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. This study suggested that internalization and replication of <italic>Brucella </italic>in TG cells play a key role in causing abortion and that TG cells are closely linked to the avoidance of maternal immune rejection.</p><p>Trophoblast cells have a phagocytic ability. During implantation, trophoblast cells invade maternal tissue by phagocytosing the uterine epithelial cells and stroma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Several molecular mechanisms involved in phagocytosis by trophoblast cells have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], but the complete process remains unclear. It has also been reported that trophoblast cells can phagocytose pathogens and that this activity is enhanced by interferon-gamma (IFN-&#x003b3; treatment) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Therefore, trophoblast cells may act in a manner similar to that of macrophages in phagocytosis. These studies suggested that trophoblast cells play a role in not only development and maintenance of placenta but also in the defense system of placenta.</p><p>Heat shock cognate protein 70 (Hsc70) is a member of the 70-kDa heat shock protein (Hsp70) family. The Hsp70 family is comprised of stress-inducible Hsp70 and constitutively expressed Hsc70. Despite the fact that it shares 80-90% sequence identity at the amino acid level with Hsp70, Hsc70 has some functional differences compared to the other members of the Hsp70 family. Hsc70 acts as a multifunctional cytoplasmic chaperone protein to fold and assemble newly synthesized proteins, and sort the proteins to different subcellular compartments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In addition, Hsc70 has some characteristic functions such as preventing apoptosis in the neurulating embryo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], presentation of antigens with MHC class II [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], and chaperone-mediated autophagy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>Hsc70 is located in different subcellular compartments; it is found in the nuclear, cytosol, and cellular membrane. Moreover, cytoplasmic Hsc70 shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. It has also been suggested that Hsc70 is released from the cells subjected to heat stress or other cytotoxic treatments, although Hsc70 has no secretion leader signal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Rotavirus reportedly enter host cells using membrane-localized Hsc70 as a receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. In addition, we have found that Hsc70 is present on the membrane of TG cells, and this is utilized by <italic>B.abortus </italic>to enter TG cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. It has also been reported that Hsc70 can bind fatty acids and bacterial LPS non-covalently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. These studies support the hypothesis that Hsc70 may participate in the uptake of extracellular antigens by TG cells, and play a principal role in immune function. However, it is unclear how Hsc70 presents on the membrane or acts in TG cells.</p><p>Clarification of the function of Hsc70 in TG cells and the phagocytic mechanism of TG cells in pregnant animals requires further investigation. In this study, we identified ezrin, a member of the family of ezrin-radixin-moesin (ERM) proteins, associated with Hsc70 that is located on the TG cell membrane, and investigated the role of ezrin and Hsc70 in bacterial uptake by TG cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>TS cells were cultured in TS medium in the presence of FGF4, heparin, and mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEFs)-conditioned medium as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].

To induce differentiation to TG cells, the cells were cultured in the TS medium alone for 3 days (about 80% of cells were differentiated to TG cells) at 37&#x000b0;C in a CO<sub>2 </sub>incubator.

To clarify the functional significance of this inference, we first tried to identify the molecules that interact with Hsc70 in TG cell membranes by mass spectrometry analysis. The membrane fraction proteins of TG cells were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a PVDF membrane. The protein reacting most strongly with POD-conjugated Hsc70 around the 75-kDa single band was extracted from the PVDF membrane and subjected to LC-MS/MS analysis. A MASCOT database search identified it as ezrin (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).

We therefore investigated the expression of ERM proteins in TG cells, TS cells, and J774 macrophage cells by immunoblotting. All ERM proteins were detectable in J774 cells, but only moesin was not detected in TS and TG cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). The expression level of ezrin in TG cells was higher than that in TS cells. Next, to confirm the ability of ERM proteins to bind to Hsc70, we tested them by pull-down assay with each recombinant ERM proteins or Hsc70. Immunoblotting of the precipitated proteins showed the association between ERM proteins and Hsc70, but there was no association when only beads were present (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). The association was also confirmed by ELISA using ERM protein-coated immunoplates. Hsc70 bounded to the ezrin-coated wells most strongly (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). It has been reported that Hsc70 contains three functional domains, i.e., ATP-binding domain (ATPase), the peptide-binding domain (PBD), and the carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. To identify the binding domain of Hsc70, the full-length, ATPase domain, and peptide-binding domain of Hsc70 were constructed, and the ability of each recombinant Hsc70 to bind to ezrin was confirmed by ELISA. Ezrin reacted with PBD of Hsc70 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>). Furthermore, we examined the localization of ezrin in TG cells.

Membrane proteins such as CD43, CD44, and intercellular adhesion proteins (ICAMs) are reported to interact with ezrin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. In this study, we demonstrated that ezrin interacts with Hsc70 localized on membrane of TG cells, and contributes to bacterial uptake by TG cells.</p><p>Ezrin is highly expressed in epithelial cells. Many studies have reported that ezrin plays roles in morphological changes by arranging the cytoskeleton organization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. In TG cells, the expression level of the endogenous ezrin protein was higher than in TS cells. This result supports the findings of a previous study that actin stress fibers also develop by differentiation of TG cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Ezrin is also thought to be an essential molecule for internalization of several intracellular pathogens that are characterized by the rearrangement of actin cytoskeleton, and can be detected at the invasion sites of these pathogens, <italic>Shigella</italic>, <italic>Listeria</italic>, and <italic>Neisseria </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. In this study, we demonstrated that internalization efficiency of <italic>Brucella </italic>was reduced significantly by ezrin knockdown in TG cells. This result suggested that internalization of <italic>Brucella </italic>is also mediated by endogenous ezrin. However, the relative decrease in the rate of internalization of live <italic>Brucella </italic>due to depletion of ezrin was lower than that of killed <italic>Brucella </italic>in TG cells. It suggested that <italic>Brucella </italic>invades the TG cells in several ways in addition to the ezrin-related route. We previously reported that the dramatic actin polymerization at the invasion sites of <italic>Brucella </italic>was not observed in TG cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Therefore, the activation of ezrin induced by internalization of <italic>Brucella </italic>may not occur, or be separate from the induction of actin polymerization event in TG cells.</p><p>Ezrin is thought to be a substrates for some kinds of tyrosine kinase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], and is phosphorylated transiently on tyrosine residues 146 and 354; it is also involved in the antigen-receptor-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation pathway in lymphocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. This tyrosine phosphorylation plays a role in cell activation and transformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Moreover, it is reported that the tyrosine phosphorylation of ezrin occurs in response to bacterial invasion. However, not all intracellular pathogens trigger tyrosine phosphorylation of ezrin by their internalization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. We could not detect upregulation of tyrosine-phosphorylated ezrin during bacterial uptake in TG cells (data not shown), and there was no tyrosine phosphorylation of ezrin at the site of bacterial uptake. Thus, interaction between Hsc70 and ezrin as well as the bacterial uptake may be independent of the tyrosine phosphorylation of ezrin.</p><p>Hsc70 has been reported to be present on the surface of several types of cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. However, it is not clear how Hsc70, which does not have a membrane-spanning domain, presents on the membrane. Several molecules have been suggested as receptors for the Hsp70 family, such as CD14, CD40, CD91, and the scavenger receptor Lox-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Hsc70 may present on the cell surface by associating with such receptors in TG cells. Meanwhile, it has been reported that Hsc70 localized on membranes by direct association with lipid rafts or cholesterol rich microdomains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. We observed that Hsc70 on TG cells membranes were affected by M&#x003b2;CD treatment, and knockdown of ezrin by siRNA also prevented the distribution of Hsc70 on the membrane. According to these results, Hsc70 may be able to present on membranes or lipid raft microdomains by interacting with ezrin. By forming a functional complex with ezrin, Hsc70 may allow the uptake of antigens by TG cells. Thus, depletion of ezrin caused a deficiency in the function of Hsc70 on TG cell membranes, and this is likely the reason why ezrin knockdown impaired bacterial uptake by TG cells. However, since ezrin can interact with many other molecules in the membrane or cytoplasm, as described above, the possibility that the interaction between ezrin and some other molecule may affect the internalization efficiency of <italic>Brucella </italic>into TG cell remains an issue to be considered.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The findings of this study that ezrin contributes to bacterial uptake by TG cells provides new information on TG cells, which can be applied in the understanding of the immune mechanism involved in pregnancy. However, it is not known whether the results observed in this study are generally applicable. Further studies on the participation of ezrin in TG cell function will reveal the mechanism of TG cells involved in immune systems in pregnancy and help the development of methods contributing to the success of pregnancies.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>MW conceived the study.
