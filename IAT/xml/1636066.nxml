In order to shed light on the underlying mechanism, experiments were conducted in zebrafish embryos in which cell competence to undergo apoptosis is acquired at specific stages of development and affects tissue morphogenesis. Zebrafish Smc3 is 95% identical to the human protein, is maternally contributed, and is expressed ubiquitously at all developmental stages. Antisense-mediated loss of Smc3 function leads to increased apoptosis in Smc3 expressing cells of the developing tail and notocord causing morphological malformations. The apoptosis and the ensuing phenotype can be suppressed by injection of a p53-specific MO that blocks the generation of endogenous p53 protein. Results in human cells constitutively lacking p53 or BAX, confirmed that a p53-dependent pathway mediates apoptosis in SMC3-deficient cells. A population of aneuploid cells accumulated in zebrafish embryos following Smc3-knockdown whereas in human cells the transient downregulation of SMC3 level lead to the generation of cells with amplified centrosome number.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Smc3 is required for normal embryonic development. Its deficiency affects the morphogenesis of tissues with high mitotic index by triggering an apoptotic cascade involving p53 and the downstream p53 target gene <italic>bax</italic>. Cells with low SMC3 level display centrosome abnormalities that can lead to or are the consequence of dysfunctional mitosis and/or aneuploidy. Collectively the data support the view that SMC3 deficiency affects chromosomal stability leading to the activation of p53-dependent mitotic checkpoint.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The structural maintenance of chromosome 3 protein (SMC3) has been first identified as a key component of the multimeric protein complex cohesin that plays an essential role during the segregation of sister chromatids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. In addition to chromosomal segregation, SMC3 is also involved in DNA recombination and repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. A multimeric complex containing BRCA1 in addition to SMC3 plays a key role as effectors of the ATM/NBS1 DNA-damage surveillance pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Recently SMC3, like p53 and BRCA1, has been identified as the target of the serine/threonine kinase Chk2 that plays a critical role in the DNA damage checkpoint pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Given its involvement in pathways affecting genomic stability, SMC3 level alteration is likely to have a significant impact on the cellular genetic integrity. Consistent with this view, elevated SMC3 level has been detected in a significant (~ 60%) fraction of human colon carcinoma and in the tumoral areas of mice genetically prone to develop polyps [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In mammalian cells the ectopic expression of SMC3 triggers their transformation to a growth attachment-independent phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Furthermore SMC3 upregulation affects the expression of members of the ras-rho/GTPase and CREB oncogenic pathways that are key players in cell cycle regulation, microtubule dynamics, and in cell differentiation and survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>Pioneering work in yeast mutants have shown that Smc3 deficiency leads to the premature separation of sister chromatids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and the disruption of the mitotic process. However key differences exist in the regulation of sister chromatid cohesion between yeast and higher eukaryotic cells. In particular the timing of dissociation of the cohesin complex from chromatin at the onset of anaphase is different [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. How cells of vertebrates respond to SMC3 downregulation has not been examined in detail. Low expression of SMC3 has been detected in rat kidney epithelial cells transfected with Ha-ras [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], in lung epithelial cells infected with WSN virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], and in damaged axons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], suggesting that downregulation of SMC3 is part of the response to oncogenes and stress. Knockdown of Smc3 in <italic>c.elegans </italic>affects chromosome segregation during mitosis and is embryonically lethal, but the underlying mechanism has not been investigated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Other studies have shown that interference with the formation or dissolution of the cohesin complex causes abnormal mitosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Knockdown of either the cystein protease securin or of its substrate separase, two key components of the machinery that free sister chromatids from the grip of cohesin at the onset of anaphase, leads to aneuploidy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Since SMC3 is an essential component of the cohesin complex, its deficiency conceivably affects the complex formation or its function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The study of the biology of SMC3 deficiency is however hampered by the fact that mammalian cells that are SMC3-deficient fail to develop into a clonal population and are selectively eliminated. To examine the mechanism and identify the chain of events, we have turned to zebrafish (<italic>danio rerio</italic>), a developmental model where apoptosis and cell growth arrest can be easily investigated in the whole organism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Zebrafish utilizes cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (p53-dependent and independent) to control morphogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. The ability to initiate cell cycle arrest and apoptosis is however acquired at different time during development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] thus offering the opportunity of discriminating the effect of a gene product on each pathways. We have discovered that in zebrafish SMC3 deficiency triggers apoptosis in highly proliferative areas such as those in the developing central nervous system and the tail. We have furthermore established that the morphological changes occurring in Smc3-deficient embryos are secondary to p53-mediated apoptosis that is triggered by the activation of the mitotic checkpoint.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Cloning and chromosomal mapping of zebrafish <italic>smc3</italic></title><p>In order to identify and characterize the zebrafish <italic>smc3 </italic>gene, the coding sequence of the human gene was used to query the NCBI zebrafish genome and dEST databases. The alignment of the sequences retrieved enabled to derive the putative sequence of the zebrafish Smc3 protein (Genbank <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="BC044408">BC044408</ext-link>). Smc3 is a polypeptide of 1216 amino acids that is &#x0003e;95% identical to the human protein (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Data mining of the genomic database showed that Smc3 is encoded by 23 exons harbored in a genomic region of 48 kb. In dEST and genomic databases screens, no other zebrafish genes with higher similarity to other subclasses of the cohesin family than to Smc3, was found. Thus, like other vertebrates, including humans, zebrafish has a single <italic>smc3 </italic>gene. The zebrafish <italic>smc3 </italic>locus is located on chromosome 22 between markers Z14657 and Z66142. Based on the mapping of neighbor genes, this chromosomal region is synthenic with human chromosome 10q25, i. e. the region harboring the <italic>SMC3 </italic>gene (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). The analysis of the protein secondary structure utilizing the COIL algorithms revealed that the conformational structure of Smc3 is fully conserved in the human protein (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). In particular the location of the coiled-coil domains and the breaks in the coiled conformation are fully conserved thus corroborating the idea that these are key structural features that are necessary for the conserved biological functions of SMC3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold><italic>Cloning and chromosomal mapping of the zebrafish smc3 gene</italic></bold>.

To investigate whether SMC3 deficiency has a similar pro-apoptotic effect in a complex cellular context, zebrafish embryos were utilized as model system. The components of the p53-dependent apoptotic pathway of mammalian cells are conserved in the zebrafish embryo and the pathway is activated at specific times during development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Apoptotic cells can easily be identified owing to the optical transparency of the embryo and since zebrafish utilizes apoptosis to direct morphogenesis, the process can be monitored in real time. In addition techniques have been developed that allow to modulate the level of any given zebrafish gene product [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. To achieve Smc3 knockdown, zebrafish were injected at the one-to-two cell stage with <italic>smc3</italic>-targeting morpholino-modified antisense oligonuclotides (MO) to block <italic>smc3 </italic>mRNA translation. In order to assess the efficacy and the specificity of the antisense oligos, MO targeting the 5'-UT region of the <italic>smc3 </italic>gene (<italic>smc3</italic>-MO) and a 4-bases mismatch control oligo (<italic>smc3</italic>-mmMO) were injected at increasing doses in the embryos' yolk. The administration of <italic>smc3</italic>-MO (1&#x02013;8 ng/embryo) leads to a dose-dependent knockdown of Smc3 protein in embryos at 24 hpf as revealed by Western immunoblot analysis of the whole embryo lysate (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). On the other hand, injection of the control <italic>smc3</italic>-mmMO (8 ng/embryo) has no effect. Embryo injected with <italic>smc3</italic>-MO did not display significant morphological alteration until somitogenesis (~ 12 hpf) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). At five-somite stage, necrosis was however evident in the eye and in the cerebellar region. At 24 hpf, in addition to brain necrosis, the morphants displayed an overall reduction of the body length. In particular the tail region was not properly extend. The tail fin was absent and the terminal region of the tail was collapsed. In addition the notocord morphology was significantly affected since unlike the characteristic tight cell packaging usually observed at this developmental stage, cells appeared round and disorganized. The severity of the morphological changes was a function of the dose of MO administered (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). A second MO targeting a different sequence of the 5'-UT region of <italic>smc3 </italic>induced the same morphological changes. The <italic>smc3 </italic>morphants could be rescued by the ectopic expression of Smc3 by administering capped <italic>smc3 </italic>mRNA confirming the specificity of the biological response observed (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Effect of SMC3-deficiency on zebrafish development.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left"><bold>Treatments</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>Embryos no.</bold></td><td align="center"><bold>Apoptotic Phenotype (%)</bold></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><italic>(A) Uninjected</italic></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><italic>1 nl Danieau buffer</italic></td><td align="left">60</td><td align="left">0%</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><italic>(B) SMC3 Morpholino-antisense</italic></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><italic>smc3-MO </italic>(1 ng)</td><td align="left">60</td><td align="left">45%</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><italic>smc3-MO </italic>(2 ng)</td><td align="left">60</td><td align="left">56%</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><italic>smc3-MO </italic>(4 ng)</td><td align="left">60</td><td align="left">86%</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><italic>smc3-MO </italic>(8 ng)</td><td align="left">60</td><td align="left">100%</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><italic>smc3-mmMO </italic>(8 ng)</td><td align="left">60</td><td align="left">5%</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><italic>(C) zfSMC3 rescue</italic></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><italic>smc3-MO </italic>(4 ng)/<italic>smc3 mRNA </italic>(250 pg)</td><td align="left">60</td><td align="left">15%</td></tr><tr><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><italic>(D) p53 Morpholino-antisense rescue</italic></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><italic>p53-MO </italic>(4 ng)</td><td align="left">60</td><td align="left">0%</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><italic>smc3-MO </italic>(4 ng)/<italic>p53-MO </italic>(4 ng)</td><td align="left">60</td><td align="left">0%</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Embryos at 1&#x02013;2 cell stage were injected in the yolk with 1&#x02013;3 nl of MO or mRNA to achieve the indicated dose.

When stained <italic>in vivo </italic>with Acridine Orange, a membrane-permeable aromatic derivative that preferentially stains apoptotic cells, 24 hpf Smc3-deficient embryos displayed intense signal at the outer perimeter of the tail tip (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). By contrast in the untreated embryos of the same age, apoptosis was confined to the prospective vent. In previous studies apoptosis in zebrafish during early development has been shown to be associated with activation of p53-dependent pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. In order to examine the role of p53 in mediating cell death in Smc3-deficient embryos, experiments were conducted in a p53-deficient background. TUNEL assay performed on the whole embryo allowed to examine the spatial distribution of apoptotic/necrotic cells at 28 hpf. The results revealed a significant increase in the number of apoptotic cells in the brain and the tail of embryos following Smc3 knockdown but not when <italic>p53</italic>-MO was co-administered with <italic>smc3</italic>-MO (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). To investigate downstream p53-dependent transcriptional responses in the zebrafish, we examined the expression of p53 target genes such as <italic>p21</italic><sup><italic>WAF</italic>1/<italic>CIP</italic>1 </sup>and <italic>cyclin D1</italic>, based on their central role in cell-cycle arrest; <italic>bax</italic>, for its involvement in the apoptosis pathway; and <italic>p53 </italic>and <italic>mdm2 </italic>to explore the feedback loops downstream of p53 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). In 24 hpf Smc3-deficient embryos semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that p53 transcript level was elevated approximately two-folds. In addition p53 protein activity was enhanced as indicated by the two fold increase in mRNA levels of the target genes <italic>mdm2</italic>, <italic>p21</italic><sup><italic>WAF</italic>1/<italic>CIP</italic>1</sup>, and <italic>bax</italic>. At the same time <italic>cyclin D1 </italic>expression was decreased suggesting a cell cycle delay at the G1-S transition. Conversely in a p53-null background, Smc3 knockdown did not affect the expression of the p53-target genes. These finding prompted us to investigate whether p53 is required for apoptosis in SMC3-deficient mammalian cells. In these experiments somatic human cells constitutively lacking either p53 or BAX and their wild type parental cell lines, were utilized. To achieve a status of SMC3 deficiency cells were transfected with <italic>SMC3</italic>-specific siRNA oligonucleotides and harvested 72 h later. Western immunoblot analysis showed that SMC3 protein level in the transfected cells had been decreased by 70% or more (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref>). Interestingly the knockdown of SMC3 had virtually no effect on the level of the SMC1 (see Additional Figure 1) further suggesting that the concentration of the two proteins is regulated independently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In p53 proficient (wild-type) HCT116 cells, SMC3 deficiency triggered significant apoptosis as evidenced by FACS analysis of the cell DNA content (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). On the other hand, SMC3 deficiency failed to trigger apoptosis in HCT116 cells lacking p53. Further corroborating the idea that a p53-dependent apoptotic pathway is responsible for cell death following SMC3 knockdown, cells lacking BAX, the terminal mediator of the p53-dependent apoptotic cascade, were refractory to apoptosis after treatment with <italic>SMC3</italic>-siRNA.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold><italic>p53 pathway activation and cell death following Smc3 knockdown</italic></bold>.

Upon DNA damage or other cellular stress, p53 becomes activated and induces either cell cycle arrest to allow DNA repair, or apoptosis to eliminate cells with elevated carcinogenic potential. In order to distinguish between these two possible outcomes, we assessed the number of mitotic cells by performing embryo whole-mount immunostaining of phosphohistone H3 (pH3), a marker for cells that have entered mitosis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Thanks to the embryo transparency pH3-reactive cells could be detected throughout the animal body. At 24 hpf mitotic cells were encountered at high frequency in the tail (105 &#x000b1; 18 pH3-positive cells/tail, n = 3). Although in lower number than that seen in the untreated embryos, several mitotic cells were also detected in the tail of Smc3-deficient embryos (73 &#x000b1; 12 cells/tail, n = 3), supporting the conclusion that increased apoptosis as opposed to a block of cell division is mainly responsible for the morphological alteration in embryos following Smc3 knockdown. This finding is consistent with the results of previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] that had concluded that after midgastrula stage, the zebrafish embryos employs apoptosis, in preference to cell proliferation arrest, to eliminate cells with damaged genetic content. Given the role that SMC3 plays during mitosis in all eukaryotic cells, abnormalities in chromosomal segregation are expected in SMC3-deficient vertebrate cells. The presence of abnormal chromosomes would then lead to the activation of both p53-dependent and independent mitotic checkpoints triggering the apoptotic cascade through which cells with aberrant chromosomes content are eliminated. In order to corroborate this hypothesis we sought for evidences of abnormal mitosis in SMC3-deficient zebrafish and human cells. During early zebrafish embryogenesis, cells divide every 30 min for the first 5.4 h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. It is estimated that upon reaching the end of the segmentation stage zebrafish somatic cells have undergone no less than a dozen cell divisions. Although cells that have undergone defective mitosis are efficiently eliminated through p53-mediated apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], if their number is large some may escape elimination and a population of aneuploid cells may thus become evident. In agreement with this scenario along with a high proportion of apoptotic/necrotic cells, a significant fraction of aneuploid cells with larger then normal DNA content were detected by FACS analysis in Smc3 deficient embryo (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>). Unlike the zebrafish embryonic cells, human cells duplicate at far lower rate and FACS analysis is not suitable to detect the small number of aneuploid cells generated after few mitosis. However defects in mitosis can be identified in mammalian cells before they enter programmed cell death by monitoring the number of centrosomes. At the onset of mitosis, normal cells contain two centrosomes that are located at the poles of the mitotic spindle. On the other hand a larger number of centrosomes is seen in those cells that have undergone defective mitosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Centrosome number abnormalities may be either the cause or the consequence of abnormal mitosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Immunostaining of &#x003b3;-tubulin &#x02013; a highly conserved constituent of this organelle, revealed that the centrosome organization is disrupted in a significant fraction of human 293 cells with low SMC3 level (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref>). The analysis performed on 200 cells per group revealed that one-fifth (43/200) of the SMC3-deficient cells display evidence of multipolar spindles whereas only few (3/200) of the normal cells display this defect.</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold><italic>Effect of Smc3 knockdown on the phosphorylation in vivo of histone H3</italic></bold>.

The zebrafish embryo is a good model for studying the interplay between genetic and environmental influences on apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Development is rapid, and embryos remain transparent throughout most of embryogenesis, simplifying the staging and analysis of whole-mounts. Before mid-blastula transition, an "embryonic" type cell cycle is operative, which is characterized by a rapid alternation between S and M phases and an apparent lack of checkpoints to monitor completion of these phases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. It has been hypothesized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] that embryos acquire a general capability for apoptosis as a consequence of passage through the maternal-to-zygotic transition, that is after the maternal determinants (mRNAs and proteins) have been exhausted or degraded and replaced by zygotic determinants. The acquisition of apoptosis capability allows the embryo to eliminate defective cells, which were inadvertently generated during the cleavage phase of development to prevent their contribution to critical lineages later in development. Block of cell growth is an alternative mechanism during embryogenesis that is activated in response to DNA damage. This mechanism operates before embryos become capable of disposing cells through apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. The fact that Smc3-deficient embryos do not display significant growth retardation at any stage of development suggests that cell cycle block is not the preferred mechanism to limit the number of defective cells arising from defective mitosis. This conclusion is also supported by the evidence that in <italic>smc3 </italic>morphants the number of pH3-reactive cells, i. e. of those cells that have entered mitosis, is not significantly affected. Collectively these data thus support the conclusion that apoptosis is specifically triggered when Smc3 level falls. Findings similar to those in the <italic>smc3 </italic>morphants have been recently reported in the <italic>crash&#x00026;burn </italic>(<italic>crb</italic>) zebrafish mutant that is genetically lacking functional B-myb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Zebrafish B-myb, like the human homolog, plays a role in the cell cycle regulation, particularly at the G2/M transition and the maintenance of normal ploidy. Metaphase spreads demonstrate that <italic>bmyb </italic>mutants contain polyploid and hypertetraploid cells. As the <italic>smc3 </italic>morphants, B-myb-null embryos progress through morphogenesis at normal pace but develop massive apoptosis in the brain and the tail region. These findings suggest that in zebrafish mitotic abnormalities are preferentially dealt with through an apoptotic response. Interestingly haploinsufficiency of <italic>bmyb </italic>leads to an increased rate of tumors after carcinogenesis whereas overexpression data from human tumors suggest that B-myb acts as an oncogene. This observation and others have lead to propose that genes controlling the mitotic checkpoint may affect tumor formation through either inactivation or overexpression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>].</p><p>In addition to mounting an apoptotic response, cells that are SMC3 or B-myb deficient display a further striking similarity in their centrosomal organization. During mitosis, two centrosomes form spindle poles and direct the formation of bipolar mitotic spindles, which is an essential event for accurate chromosome segregation into daughter cells. The presence of more than two centrosomes severely disturbs mitotic process and cytokinesis via formation of more than two spindle poles, resulting in an increased frequency of chromosome segregation errors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Centrosome amplification is an early event in tumor formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. It occurs in almost all type of cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] and is considered as a major contributing factor for chromosome instability in cancer cells leading to aneuploidy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Given that the centrosome organization is disrupted in a significant fraction of cells with low SMC3 level and that the effect is detectable after transient SMC3 level alteration within the context of few cell duplications, we speculate that SMC3 may directly affect the centrosome duplication process. The mechanisms leading to centrosome amplification are still poorly understood. High dose of gamma irradiation that induce DNA strand breaks, induces centrosome amplification but the mechanism through which DNA damage leads to centrosome amplification remains to be elucidated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Conceivably the mechanism involves proteins that like SMC3 are members of the DNA recombination/repair mechanism and of the mitotic spindle checkpoint. Various proteins that associate with centrosomes such as pericentrin, STK15/BTAK/Aurora-A kinase, ATR, BRCA1, BRCA2, have been shown to influence centrosome duplication in human cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. Of these proteins, BRCA1 has been shown to bind to SMC3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In addition SMC3 binds to dynactin (this lab's unpublished observation) and KIF3B kinesin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>], two key components of the centrosome multimeric protein complex. The ability of SMC3 to interact with a number of centrosome proteins hints to a possible mechanism through which SMC3 may influence centrosome duplication. Further work is needed to elucidate the potential role of SMC3 on centrosome dynamics that may be also indirect and complex.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this paper we have described the cloning of zebrafish <italic>smc3 </italic>and determined that its expression is required for normal embryonic development. Smc3 deficiency triggers an apoptotic cascade involving p53 and the downstream p53 target gene <italic>bax</italic>. The morphology of tissues such as the tail that during normal development utilize apoptosis for remodeling, is drastically altered. The effect of SMC3 deficiency in human cells recapitulates the results in zebrafish and confirm the involvement of p53. Human SMC3-deficient cells contain an excess number of centrosomes, whereas a population of aneuploid cells is detected in <italic>smc3 </italic>morphants suggesting that SMC3 is a gatekeeper of genetic stability. We postulate that the deviation of SMC3 from a certain level leads to catastrophic mitoses. The ensuing aneuploidy in turn activates the p53 apoptotic pathway leading to the observed morphological changes. Because aneuploidy is thought to contribute to malignant transformation and tumor progression, these data suggest a link between <italic>smc3 </italic>haploinsufficiency or loss-of-function and tumorigenesis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cells</title><p>Human kidney embryonic 293 (HEK293) cells were obtained from ATCC (CRL-1573). p53-null and BAX-null human colon carcinoma HCT116 cells and the parental wild-type cell lines were a kind gift of Dr. Volgelstein.
