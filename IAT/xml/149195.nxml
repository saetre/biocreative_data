Control of the accumulation and nuclear entry of the negative regulators PER and CRY is believed to be a key step in these loops. We clarified the mutual interaction between zebrafish clock-related proteins and their sub-cellular localizations in NIH3T3 cells. Six CRYs exist in zebrafish, of which zCRY1a strongly represses zCLOCK1: zBMAL3-mediated transcription, but zCRY3 does not. We show that zCRY1a interacts with zCLOCK1 and zBMAL3, facilitating nuclear accumulation, whereas zCRY3 associates with neither one and does not influence their sub-cellular distributions. We cloned <italic>zPer2</italic> cDNA and showed that the protein product encoded by the cDNA acts as a moderate transcriptional repressor. In our sub-cellular localization studies we also found that zPER2 interacts with the zCLOCK1:zBMAL3 heterodimer, causing its cytoplasmic retention. zCRY1a and zPER2 apparently have opposite effects on the sub-cellular distribution of zCLOCK:zBMAL heterodimer. We speculate that the opposite regulation of the sub-cellular distribution of this is associated with the different transcriptional repression abilities of zCRY1a and zPER2. zCRY1a acts as a potent transcriptional inhibitor by interacting directly with the zCLOCK:zBMAL heterodimer in the nucleus, whereas zPER2 maintains the zCLOCK:zBMAL heterodimer in the cytoplasm, resulting in transactivation repression.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Circadian rhythms constitute a ubiquitous process that regulates various biochemical and physiological events of approximate 24 h periodicity, even in the absence of external time cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg174c1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg174c3">3</xref>). Under natural conditions, rhythms are entrained to a 24 h day by environmental time cues, most commonly light. Timing of the clock is established in a cell-autonomous manner by a transcription&#x0002f;translation-based negative feedback loop. This loop consists of positive and negative elements, the positive ones being two basic helix&#x02013; loop&#x02013;helix, PAS domain-containing transcription factors, CLOCK and BMAL. When these transcription factors heterodimerize, they drive the transcription of such negative components of the clock genes as three <italic>Period</italic> genes (in the mouse, designated <italic>mPer1</italic>, <italic>mPer2</italic> and <italic>mPer3</italic>) and two <italic>Cryptochrome</italic> genes (<italic>mCry1</italic> and <italic>mCry2</italic>). The products of these clock genes then negatively regulate their own expression, thereby setting up the rhythmic oscillations of gene expression that drive the circadian clock.</p><p>To produce stable oscillations of gene expression that have a 24-h period, there must be a delay between the production and action of inhibitory clock gene products. Controlled accumulation, sub-cellular localization and degradation of clock proteins make up the important process that produces this delay. <italic>Drosophila</italic> TIMELESS (TIM) heterodimerizes with dPER, and the resulting heterodimer stabilizes dPER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg174c4">4</xref>). dPER:TIM heterodimers then translocate to the nucleus where they interact with dCLOCK and CYC (<italic>Drosophila</italic> homolog of mammalian BMAL). Formation of a complex decreases dCLOCK:CYC-mediated transcription, resulting in repression of expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg174c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg174c6">6</xref>). Stabilization of dPER by formation of a heterodimer with TIM and subsequent nuclear translocation together constitute a key process by which the feedback loop oscillates on a 24-h time scale in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. In mammals, stabilization of PER by formation of a heterodimer with a clock protein and subsequent nuclear translocation also are important for the negative feedback loop. CRY1 and CRY2, however, are partners of the PER heterodimer instead of TIM. When mPER and mCRY proteins are translated, they form PER:CRY heterodimers that are translocated to the nucleus. In the nucleus, these proteins act as negative regulators by interacting with CLOCK and&#x0002f;or BMAL1 to inhibit transcription, thereby forming a negative feedback loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg174c7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg174c9">9</xref>). Consistent with this model, mice lacking both <italic>mCry1</italic> and <italic>2</italic> or both <italic>mPer1</italic> and <italic>2</italic> show complete loss of circadian rhythmicity in wheel-running behavior immediately upon being placed in constant dark (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg174c10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg174c12">12</xref>). The difference in the functions of these proteins is not well understood; in particular, which one is the direct factor for transcriptional repression, and how nuclear entry is regulated. Although both proteins repress the circadian promoter driven by the CLOCK&#x0002f;BMAL heterodimer transcription factor, PER causes only moderate repression, whereas CRY1 and CRY2 appear to be much more potent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg174c7">7</xref>). <italic>In vitro</italic> transfection results show that exogenously expressed mPER2 can localize in the nucleus and that co-expression with mCRY (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg174c7">7</xref>) or mPER3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg174c13">13</xref>) proteins promotes its nuclear entry. Localization of endogenous proteins showed weak accumulations of mCRY1 and mCRY2 and of mPER1 and 2 in nuclei of per1-&#x0002f;per2- and cry1-&#x0002f;cry2- double mutant mice livers, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg174c14">14</xref>). These findings indicate that co-dependency is required between the mPER and mCRY proteins for effective nuclear translocation. Another transfection study provided contrasting evidence that mPER2 enters the nucleus in a mCRY-independent manner and shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm by means of a functional nuclear localization signal (NLS) and nuclear export sequences present in the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg174c15">15</xref>). These findings suggest that the mPER and mCRY proteins enter the nucleus independently, cooperatively or both. CLOCK:BMAL-mediated transcription therefore is repressed in various ways.</p><p>The zebrafish is an attractive model with which to study the biological clock in vertebrates. The most remarkable and unique feature in the zebrafish system is the ability to respond to light. Several clock-related genes show circadian expression in zebrafish cells, including those in <italic>ex vivo</italic> peripheral tissues placed for a period of days in culture dishes and those in zebrafish-derived cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg174c16">16</xref>). Moreover, as the circadian clock of these cells is entrained by light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg174c17">17</xref>), the zebrafish system provides a unique setting for the study of clock-related transcription. Several zebrafish homologs of clock genes have been cloned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg174c18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg174c22">22</xref>). To better understand the roles of the zCRY and zPER2 proteins in the zebrafish circadian clock, the interactions with clock-related proteins and their sub-cellular distributions after transfection were examined in cultured cells. Initially, zebrafish-derived cells were used for transfection but they had low transfection efficiencies and protein products of the transfected genes were barely detectable by immunoprecipitation. Mouse NIH3T3 cells were therefore used. The results obtained for mouse cells are consistent with those for the zebrafish cells examined. Six <italic>Cry</italic> genes (<italic>zCry1a, 1b, 2a, 2b, 3</italic> and <italic>4</italic>) have been cloned in zebrafish. Investigation of their <italic>in vitro</italic> functions showed that they fall into two groups: one inhibits CLOCK-BMAL-mediated transcription (repressor type CRY) and the other does not have transcription inhibitor activity (non-repressor type CRY) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg174c19">19</xref>). We characterized the two zCRYs, zCRY1a and zCRY3 former and latter types of CRY, respectively. We found that zCRY1a and zPER2 function as regulators of the sub-cellular localizations of zCLOCK, zBMAL and&#x0002f;or the zCLOCK: zBMAl heterodimer and that they control cellular localization of the heterodimer in opposite directions. In addition, unlike in mammals, the co-expression of zCRY1a and zPER2 causes cytoplasmic retention of the zCRY:zPER2 heterodimer. These findings suggest that functions for CRY and PER2 exist that are unique to the zebrafish circadian system.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cloning of zebrafish <italic>Per2</italic> cDNA</title><p><italic>zPer2</italic> cDNA was cloned from an adult cDNA library (purchased from Clontech) by combination of polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based cloning strategies and cDNA library screening.

A mouse vasopressin (mAVP) E-box element was the reporter construct. Co-expression of zCLOCK1 with zBMAL3 strongly stimulated transcription from the mAVP E-box element (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg174f1">1</xref>A, lane 2). zCRY1a efficiently inhibited the zCLOCK1-zBMAL3 mediated transactivation, whereas zCRY3 did not (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg174f1">1</xref>A, lanes 3&#x02013;8), as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg174c19">19</xref>). On the other hand, zPER2 caused a moderate transcriptional inhibition. zCRY1a inhibited CLOCK:BMAL-mediated transcription almost completely by transfection of 50 ng DNA, whereas zPER2 caused a 60&#x00025; inhibition by transfection of 700 ng DNA, indicative that zCRY1a and zPER2 inhibit CLOCK:BMAL-mediated transcription in a different manner. Next zCRY1a and zPER2 were co-expressed and their effects on the CLOCK:BMAL-mediated transcription were examined. To exclude the possibility that either one of the added DNAs, zPER2 or zCRY, alone would be expressed in the transfected cells, we constructed a dual expression plasmid, pCRY1aPER2, designed to express both zCRY1a-HA and zPER2-V5 simultaneously, and performed the same assay. When pCRY1aPER2 was used, zCLOCK1:zBMAL3-induced transactivation was completely repressed by transfection of 200 ng of DNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg174f1">1</xref>A, lane 15), however transfection of 50 ng DNA caused only 40&#x00025; inhibition (lane 13). Co-expression of zPER2 did not show any additive effects, and on the contrary slightly inhibited the activity of zCRY1a. Western blots of cell lysates transfected with pCRY1aPER2 showed expression of zCRY1a-HA and zPER2-V5 at detectable levels and both proteins co-immunoprecipitated (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg174f1">1</xref>B). Absence of any additive effect of zPER2 co-expression therefore was neither due to failure of the expression of the transfected genes nor to lack of interaction between the expressed proteins. To know why zPER2 co-expression did not show any obvious effect on the zCRY&#x02019;s inhibition ability of CLOCK:BMAL-mediated transcription, we examined the interactions between zCRYs, zPER2, zCLOCK1 and zBMAL3 and their sub-cellular localizations.</p></sec><sec><title>Different abilities of zCRY1a and 3 to interact with other clock proteins</title><p>The mammalian two-hybrid assay was used to examine the abilities of zCRY1a and 3 to interact with each of three other clock proteins: zCLOCK1, zBMAL3 and zPER2. In that assay, one of the zCRYs or zPER2 which fused to the GAL4 DNA-binding domain (GAL4) was co-expressed with each clock protein fused to the VP16 transactivation domain (VP16) in the NIH3T3 cells. If GAL4-zCRY or GAL4-zPER2 interacts functionally with VP16-fused protein, VP16 would be recruited to the vicinity of the promoter and should cause transactivation. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg174f2">2</xref>A, when GAL4-zCRY1a was co-expressed with VP16-zCLOCK1 (lane 6) or VP16-zBMAL3 (lane 7) transcription was marked. In contrast, when GAL4-zCRY3 was co-expressed with VP16-zCLOCK1 or VP16-zBMAL3 no transactivation occurred (lanes 8 and 9).</p><p>The immunoprecipitation data showed that zCRY1a and zPER2 form a stable complex (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg174f1">1</xref>B). The interactions between zCRYs and zPER2 were also examined by the two-hybrid assay (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg174f2">2</xref>C). When VP16-zCRY1a or 3 was co-expressed with GAL4-zPER2, both induced transactivation although the transactivation induced by zCRY3 was weaker than that by zCRY1a. These findings show that zCRY1a interacts with zPER2, zCLOCK1 and zBMAL3 whereas zCRY3 only with zPER2.</p></sec><sec><title>Determination of the binding domain of zPER2 to zCRY</title><p>zPER2 deletion mutants were constructed to determine the CRY-binding domain of zPER2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg174f2">2</xref>B). The ability of each mutant to bind zCRY1a or 3 was determined by the mammalian two-hybrid assay. Intact zPER2 and all mutants bearing the C-terminal domain showed transactivation when co-transfected with each of the zCRYs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg174f2">2</xref>C, lanes 2, 4, 7, 9, 11 and 14), whereas deletion mutants lacking that domain showed weak or no transactivation (lanes 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 13 and 15), indicative that the C-terminal region of zPER2 (amino acid 1201&#x02013;1400) is important for its binding to zCRYs. Except for the interaction between the N-terminal region of zPER2 and zCRY1a (lanes 3 and 8), this is consistent with the findings for mammalian PER2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg174c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg174c25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg174c27">27</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>zCRY1a, zPER2, zCLOCK1 and zBMAL3 form a stable complex</title><p>Next we examined whether zPER2 interacts with zCLOCK1, zBMAL3 or zCLOCK1:zBMAL3 heterodimer by immunoprecipitation assay (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg174f3">3</xref>). When zPER2-V5 was co-expressed with zCLOCK1-VP16 or with zBMAL3-VP16, zPER2 alone was detected in the anti-V5 precipitated materials (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg174f3">3</xref>A, lanes 1 and 2). However, when zPER-HA, zCLOCK-VP16, and zBMAL-HA were co-expressed, all three proteins were immunoprecipitated by the use of anti-VP16 antibody (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg174f3">3</xref>B, lane 1).

When the four proteins were co-expressed, they were immunoprecipitated by the use of anti-VP-16 antibody (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg174f3">3</xref>B, lane 2), which is indicative that zCRY1a does not disrupt zPER2-zCLOCK1: zBMAL3 complex but forms a ternary zCRY1a-zPER2-zCLOCK1:zBMAL3 complex.</p></sec><sec><title>zCRY1a facilitates nuclear accumulation of zCLOCK1, zBMAL3 and zCLOCK1:zBMAL3 heterodimer</title><p>A recent <italic>in vivo</italic> study found that in mouse liver a CRY deficiency alters the sub-cellular distribution of both the CLOCK and BMAL1 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg174c14">14</xref>). Conceivably, zCRY affects the sub-cellular location of both zCLOCK1 and zBMAL3 in cultured cells. We therefore used the imunofluorescence of epitope-tagged proteins to examine the effect of the co-expression of zCRY1a or 3 on the sub-cellular localization of zCLOCK1 or zBMAL3. The location was the cytoplasm (N&#x0003c;C), both the cytoplasm and nucleus (N&#x0003d;C) or the nucleus (N&#x0003e;C).</p><p>First, each of the zCRYs, zBMAL3 and zCLOCK1 was expressed singly in NIH3T3 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg174f4">4</xref>). Interestingly, zCRY1a and 3 had different sub-cellular localizations. zCRY1a was distributed in the nucleus (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg174f4">4</xref>A and B, lanes 1&#x02013;3). zCRY3 was distributed mainly in the cytoplasm (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg174f4">4</xref>B, lanes 10&#x02013;12). zBMAL3 and zCLOCK1 also had different sub-cellular distributions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg174f4">4</xref>A and C). zBMAL3 was detected in the nucleus and in both the cytoplasm and nucleus (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg174f4">4</xref>C, lanes 1&#x02013;3), whereas zCLOCK1 was distributed only in the cytoplasm (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg174f4">4</xref>C, lanes 10&#x02013;12).</p><p>zCLOCK1 and zBMAL3 act as transcriptional regulator by forming heterodimer. We then examined whether the sub-cellular distributions of the two proteins change when they are expressed in the same cell and then form heterodimer. For this purpose, a dual expression plasmid, pCLOCK1BMAL3, designed to express VP16-zCLOCK1 and FLAG-zBMAL3 simultaneously, was constructed. VP16-zCLOCK1 and FLAG-zBMAL3 were efficiently expressed as a functional heterodimer by pCLOCK1BMAL3 because transfection of the pCLOCK1BMAL3 plasmid markedly induced transcription from the reporter gene (data not shown). When zCLOCK1 and zBMAL3 were expressed in the same cell, the sub-cellular location of zCLOCK1 changed from the cytoplasm to the nucleus (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg174f5">5</xref>, lanes 4&#x02013;6).</p><p>Next we examined the effect of the co-expression of zCRY1a or 3 on the sub-cellular localization of zCLOCK1 or zBMAL3. Interestingly, when zCRY1a was co-transfected with zBMAL3 or zCLOCK1, it promoted the nuclear accumulation of both zBMAL3 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg174f4">4</xref>C, lanes 4&#x02013;6) and zCLOCK1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg174f4">4</xref>C, lanes 13&#x02013;15). In particular, the sub-cellular localization of zCLOCK1 changed markedly from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. The effect of each zCRY on the sub-cellular distribution of the zCLOCK1:zBMAL3 heterodimer was examined. By the use of pCLOCK1BMAL3 together with a plasmid to express a <italic>cry</italic> gene, three proteins could be expressed at the same time. The tendency for nuclear localization of the heterodimer was greatly enhanced by co-expression with zCRY1a. When zCLOCK1 and zBMAL3 were expressed together with zCRY1a, almost all the co-expressed proteins were in the nucleus (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg174f5">5</xref>, lanes 7&#x02013;18). In contrast, the sub-cellular locations of zBMAL3 and zCLOCK1 were not affected by co-expression with zCRY3 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg174f4">4</xref>C, lanes 7&#x02013;9 and 16&#x02013;18, and Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg174f5">5</xref>, lanes 19&#x02013;30).</p></sec><sec><title>zPER2 traps zCRY1a in the cytoplasm</title><p>In cultured mammalian cells, mammalian CRYs interact with mammalian PERs to facilitate nuclear translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg174c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg174c25">25</xref>). As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg174f2">2</xref>C, zCRY1a and 3 interact with zPER2, therefore, the effect of each zCRY on the sub-cellular localization of zPER2 was examined. When expressed singly, zPER2 localized mainly in the cytoplasm (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg174f6">6</xref>A and B, lanes 1&#x02013;3). Unlike mammalian PER2, the sub-cellular localization of zPER2 was not affected by co-expression with zCRY (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg174f6">6</xref>A, lanes 7&#x02013;9 and 16&#x02013;18). Surprisingly, co-expression with zPER2 caused cytoplasmic retention of zCRY1a (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg174f6">6</xref>A, lanes 10&#x02013;12). The effect of the co-expression of zPER2, which lacks the C-terminal, on the sub-cellular localization of zCRY1a was also examined (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg174f6">6</xref>B). Deletion of that region did not change the sub-cellular localization of zPER2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg174f6">6</xref>B, lanes 1&#x02013;3). Nor was the sub-cellular distribution of zCRY1a affected by co-expression with zPER2 lacking the C-terminal (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg174f6">6</xref>B, lanes 10&#x02013;12). zCRY3 co-expressed with the intact or C-terminal-lacking zPER2 remained cytoplasmic (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg174f6">6</xref>A and B, lanes 19&#x02013;21). These findings and the fact that the C-terminal domain of zPER2 is the zCRY binding site (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg174f2">2</xref>B and C) suggest that zPER2 causes cytoplasmic trapping of zCRY1a by direct interaction with it via its C-terminal domain.</p></sec><sec><title>zPER2 tends to induce the cytoplasmic distribution of the zCLOCK1:zBMAL3 heterodimer</title><p>Whether zPER2 affects the sub-cellular locations of zCLOCK1 and zBMAL3 was examined. When zCLOCK1 or zBMAL3 was co-expressed with zPER2, no change in the sub-cellular distribution of zCLOCK1, zBMAL3 or zPER2 occurred (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg174f7">7</xref>A). However zPER2 had an effect on the sub-cellular distributions of these proteins when they formed heterodimers. When zCLOCK1 and zBMAL3 both were co-expressed with zPER2, the cell population in which zCLOCK1 and zBMAL3 were present in the nucleus disappeared, and that present in the cytoplasm increased markedly (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg174f7">7</xref>B, lanes 7&#x02013;18). These results are consistent with the immunoprecipitation data (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg174f3">3</xref>) and are indicative that zPER2 tends to induce the cytoplasmic distribution of zCLOCK1:zBMAL3 heterodimer.</p><p>We next undertook co-expression of four proteins: zCRY1a, zPER2, zCLOCK1 and zBMAL3. Co-expression of zCRY1a in addition to zPER2, zCLOCK1 and zBMAL3 changed the distributions of the proteins; the cell population having the nuclear distribution increased and that having cytoplasmic distribution decreased (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg174f7">7</xref>B, lanes 19&#x02013;30). When zCRY1a, zPER2, zCLOCK1 and zBMAL3 were co-expressed, all four proteins form a ternary complex (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg174f3">3</xref>). Taken together, these findings show that zCRY1a facilitates nuclear accumulation of zCLOCK1:zBMAL3 heterodimer, whereas zPER2 promotes its cytoplasmic distribution.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Previous circadian mechanism models have shown that control of the nuclear accumulation of circadian regulators is an important process in the transcriptional&#x0002f;translational negative feedback loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg174c28">28</xref>). CRYs and PERs constitute an important type of circadian regulator in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg174c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg174c10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg174c12">12</xref>), therefore their nuclear entry and subsequent degradation by an unknown factor or their nuclear export must be a key factor in establishing the rhythmic oscillation of gene expression. We identified a novel function of zebrafish CRY and PER2. They regulate the sub-cellular localizations of other circadian regulators, the zCLOCK and zBMAL proteins. Moreover, these two proteins were shown to control sub-cellular localization of the zCLOCK:zBMAL heterodimer in opposite directions (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg174f5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg174f7">7</xref>B).</p><p>These opposite effects of the proteins on the nuclear-cytoplasmic distribution of the zCLOCK:zBMAL heterodimer may be due to different transcriptional inhibition abilities. In the reporter assay (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg174f1">1</xref>A), zCRY1a and zPER2 repressed CLOCK:BMAL-mediated transcription differently; zCRY1a almost completely inhibited transcription, whereas zPER2 produced only moderate repression. A sub-cellular localization experiment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg174f5">5</xref>) showed that when zCRY1a is co-expressed with the zCLOCK1:zBMAL3 heterodimer, all three proteins accumulate in the nucleus, consistent with our recent report that zCRY1a forms a stable complex with CRY-CLOCK-BMAL-E-box-containing DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg174c21">21</xref>). zCRY1a therefore is believed to act as a transcriptional repressor that interacts directly with CLOCK and&#x0002f;or BMAL1 in the nucleus, as do mCRYs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg174c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg174c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg174c14">14</xref>). In contrast, zPER2 promotes cytoplasmic retention of the zCLOCK1:zBMAL3 heterodimer (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg174f7">7</xref>B, lanes 7&#x02013;18). Conceivably, this zPER2-induced cytoplasmic retention of the heterodimer results in repression of zCLOCK:zBMAL-mediated transcription (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg174f1">1</xref>A, lanes 9&#x02013;12). The significance of the protein&#x02019;s nucleo-cytoplasmic localization control has been described for the cell cycle regulator cdc2-cyclin B1 complex. Translocation of the complex to the nucleus in late G2 initiates cell progression from G2 to mitosis. 14-3-3 Sigma, a protein that regulates cellular activity, sequesters the complex in the cytoplasm, maintaining G2 arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg174c29">29</xref>). It is tempting to speculate that zPER2 inhibits zCLOCK:zBMAL-induced transcription via a similar mechanism. Interestingly, when zCRY1a, zPER2 and the zCLOCK:zBMAL3 heterodimer were co-expressed, the four proteins co-localized both in the nucleus (N&#x0003e;C) and cytoplasm (N&#x0003c;C). This suggests another zCRY1a-mediated mechanism for transcriptional repression, in which zCRY1a, working together with zPER2, keeps the zCLOCK:zBMAL heterodimer in the cytoplasm.</p><p>In mammals, CRY and PER form heterodimers, which are redistributed from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. Unlike mammalian PER2, zPER2 localizes in the cytoplasm and is not translocated to the nucleus when co-expressed with zCRY (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg174f6">6</xref>A and B, lanes 7&#x02013;9). Instead, it is retained in the cytoplasm and causes cytoplasmic retention of zCRY (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg174f6">6</xref>A, lanes 10&#x02013;12). This unique sub-cellular localization of zPER2 must be due to the malfunction of its NLS. A recent <italic>in vitro</italic> study showed that in mammalian cells CRY interacts with PER2 (rat PER2), rendering its NLS (residues 778&#x02013;794) functional to translocate the CRY:PER2 complex to the nucleus and that the elimination of NLS from PER2 results in cytoplasmic retention of the CRY:PER2 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg174c25">25</xref>). The corresponding NLS (residues 876&#x02013;892) of zPER2 has little similarity to the NLSs of mammalian PER2 proteins. We speculate that zPER2 NLS is not functional, which leads to cytoplasmic trapping of the zCRY:zPER2 complex as with mammalian PER2 lacking its NLS. A recent study reported that zPER2 functions in light entrainment pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg174c20">20</xref>). Identification of the <italic>in vivo</italic> role of the zPER2-mediated cytoplasmic retention of zCRY should provide a clearer understanding of the input mechanism in the zebrafish circadian system.</p><p>We showed that zCRY1a interacts with zCLOCK1, zBMAL3 and the zCLOCK1:zBMAL3 heterodimer, thereby facilitating their nuclear accumulations (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg174f2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg174f4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg174f5">5</xref>). As zCRY1a is a potent transcriptional inhibitor (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg174f1">1</xref>A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg174c19">19</xref>), the translocation of the positive component (CLOCK and BMAL) to the nucleus by the negative component (CRY) is logically inconsistent. Possibly, the transcriptional repressor activity of zCRY1a is blocked by some unknown factor and only when that factor is inactivated does zCRY1a work as a transcriptional repressor. Alternatively, certain intracellular conditions may regulate zCRY1a repressor activity. Recent <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and <italic>Drosophila</italic> studies showed that light induces a conformational change in CRY by means of an intramolecular or intermolecular redox reaction that is interceded by flavin adenine dinucleotide, resulting in the active CRY form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg174c30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg174c32">32</xref>). Although the transcriptional inhibition reaction by CRY is reported to be independent of light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg174c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg174c33">33</xref>), the fact that mammalian CRYs are flavoproteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg174c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg174c35">35</xref>), as are those of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and <italic>Drosophila</italic>, indicates that their transcriptional repression may be regulated by the cellular redox state.</p><p>At least six kinds of CRYs are present in zebrafish cells. They are classified as repressor (zCRY1a, 1b, 2a and 2b) and non-repressor (zCRY3 and 4) type CRYs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg174c19">19</xref>). The functional differences in these zCRYs have yet to be clarified. Here we have shown the difference between the former, zCRY1a, and latter, zCRY3, types. zCRY2b, a repressor type CRY, is similar to zCRY1a in its sub-cellular localization and interaction with the CLOCK:BMAL heterodimer (data not shown), indicative that repressor-type CRYs have these features in common. Differences in their expression patterns and strengths of interaction with other clock-related proteins may be important factors in clock regulation in zebrafish cells. Another interesting issue is identification of the photoreceptor. In a recent report, zCRY1b and zCRY3 have been pointed to be good candidates for the photoreceptor because their expressions do not oscillate in the light-responsive zebrafish culture cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg174c36">36</xref>). The data on zCRY3 given here are not incompatible with the prediction that zCRY3 is the photoreceptor. What is the actual photoreceptor for entrainment in light-responsive zebrafish cells, however, remains a question.</p><p>Multiple <italic>Clock</italic> and <italic>Bmal</italic> genes exist in the zebrafish; three <italic>Clock</italic> genes (<italic>zClock1</italic>, <italic>2</italic> and <italic>3</italic>) and three <italic>Bmal</italic> genes (<italic>zBmal1</italic>, <italic>2</italic> and <italic>3</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg174c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg174c21">21</xref>). Each pair-wise combination of these zCLOCKs and zBMALs activates transcription from the E-box-containing promoter, but the extent of transactivation differs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg174c21">21</xref>). Conceivably, zCRYs and zPER2 regulate zCLOCK:zBMAL-mediated transcription by controlling the nucleo-cytoplasmic distribution of each of the zCLOCKs, zBMALs or the zCLOCK:zBMAL heterodimers thereby changing their combinations. This is done by masking the activity of CRY in order to anchor the heterodimer in the nucleus or by masking the PER2 domain that facilitates cytoplasmic distribution. Further study of the proteins associated with CRY and&#x0002f;or PER, which regulate their interactions with the CLOCK:BMAL heterodimer as well as nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling, should clarify the molecular mechanism of transcriptional repression which produces the circadian oscillation of gene expression.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkg174f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> zCRY1a and zPER2 inhibit CLOCK:BMAL-mediated transcription in a different manner.
