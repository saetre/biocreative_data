This hypermodified nucleoside ensures correct codon recognition by stabilizing codon-anticodon pairings during the decoding process in the ribosome. TYW4 is an <italic>S</italic>-adenosylmethionine (SAM)-dependent enzyme that catalyzes the final step of yW biosynthesis, methylation and methoxycarbonylation. However, the structural basis for the catalytic mechanism by TYW4, and especially that for the methoxycarbonylation, have remained elusive. Here we report the apo and cofactor-bound crystal structures of yeast TYW4. The structures revealed that the C-terminal domain folds into a &#x003b2;-propeller structure, forming part of the binding pocket for the target nucleoside. A comparison of the apo, SAM-bound, and <italic>S</italic>-adenosylhomocysteine-bound structures of TYW4 revealed a drastic structural change upon cofactor binding, which may sequester solvent from the catalytic site during the reaction and facilitate product release after the reaction. In conjunction with the functional analysis, our results suggest that TYW4 catalyzes both methylation and methoxycarbonylation at a single catalytic site, and in the latter reaction, the methoxycarbonyl group is formed through the fixation of carbon dioxide.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), including transfer RNA (tRNA), ribosomal RNA, small RNA and small nuclear RNA, are involved in various cellular functions, such as translation of the genetic code and posttranscriptional RNA processing. One of the most distinctive features of the ncRNAs is their posttranscriptional modification, which confers a greater variety of chemical properties than those of the unmodified nucleosides (i.e. A, U, G and C). More than 100 modifications have been reported in ncRNAs, and most have been found in tRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). The various chemical properties of the modifications are considered to contribute to higher-order biological processes through structural stabilization and molecular recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). For example, modifications in the tRNA core region are considered to be important for structural formation and stabilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). On the other hand, modifications found in the tRNA anticodon arm ensure the correct codon-anticodon pairing in the ribosome.</p><p>Wybutosine (yW) is a modified nucleoside that functions in the molecular recognition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). The yW nucleotide is exclusively located at position 37 of eukaryotic phenylalanine tRNA (tRNA<sup>Phe</sup>), which is adjacent to the 3&#x02032;-position of the Phe anticodon (<sup>34</sup>GAA<sup>36</sup>). It is one of the most extensively hypermodified nucleosides ever found in RNA, and it has a distinctive chemical structure: a tricyclic 1<italic>H</italic>-imidazo[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,2-&#x003b1;]purine core structure and a large side chain attached to the tricyclic base (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Recent studies on the yW nucleotide have highlighted the importance of this nucleotide in the maintenance of translational fidelity. Although yW lacks a major influence on the phenylalanylation of tRNA<sup>Phe</sup> under physiological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>), tRNA<sup>Phe</sup> lacking the yW modification was shown to enhance codon frame shifting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>), which reportedly activates the replication of human immunodeficiency virus RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Therefore, the bulky hydrophobic structure of yW may stabilize the codon-anticodon pairing in the ribosome through the base-stacking interaction, thereby maintaining the correct reading frame (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). <fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Biosynthetic pathway of wybutosine. The chemical structures of (<bold>A</bold>) <italic>N</italic><sup>1</sup>-methylguanosine (m<sup>1</sup>G), (<bold>B</bold>) 4-demethylwyosine (imG-14), (<bold>C</bold>) 7-(&#x003b1;-amino-&#x003b1;-carboxypropyl)wyosine (yW-72) and (<bold>D</bold>) wybutosine (yW), are shown. TRM5 transfers a methyl group to G37 to produce m<sup>1</sup>G37, utilizing SAM as a methyl donor. TYW1 catalyzes the cyclization reaction to produce a tricyclic nucleoside, imG-14. TYW2 and TYW3 attach &#x003b1;-amino-&#x003b1;-carboxypropyl and methyl groups on C7 and N4, respectively. Finally, TYW4 attaches methyl and methoxycarbonyl groups (highlighted), completing the yW formation.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkp158f1"/></fig></p><p>Recent studies have shown that the biosynthetic pathway of yW is a multienzymatic process involving five enzymes, the <italic>S</italic>-adenosylmethionine (SAM)-dependent tRNA methylase (TRM5) and the tRNA-yW synthesizing enzymes 1&#x02013;4 (TYW1&#x02013;4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10 B11 B12">10&#x02013;12</xref>). First, the guanosine residue at position 37 is converted into the distinctive tricyclic structure by TRM5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>), and the FeS-cluster-containing radical SAM enzyme, TYW1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A and B). Subsequently, TYW2, 3 and 4 attach the exocyclic groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B, C and D) to complete yW formation. Interestingly, a recent study demonstrated that the specific intermediates in the progression of these multienzymatic steps show incremental changes in frameshift efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>), underscoring the importance of completely formed yW for the correct translation of the genetic code.</p><p>TYW4 catalyzes the final step of yW biosynthesis, i.e. the modification to the &#x003b1;-amino-&#x003b1;-carboxypropyl (acp) side chain attached at the C7 position of the tricyclic ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>C and D) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). An <italic>in vitro</italic> biochemical analysis suggested that TYW4 catalyzes two independent reactions: methylation of the &#x003b1;-carboxyl group and methoxycarbonylation of the &#x003b1;-amino group of the acp side chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Therefore, these modifications by TYW4 increase the bulkiness as well as the hydrophobicity of the side chain of the yW base, which might further stabilize the codon-anticodon pairing in the ribosome. However, the mechanism of the methoxycarbonylation, and especially the source of the methoxycarbonyl group, still remain unknown. Moreover, the mechanism by which TYW4 attaches two different chemical groups (i.e. methyl and methoxycarbonyl) to two distant sites (i.e. &#x003b1;-carboxyl and &#x003b1;-amino groups; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>D) on the yW precursor also remains unknown. The N-terminal half of TYW4 shares primary structure similarity with protein phosphatase methyltransferase 1 (PPM1), which catalyzes the SAM-dependent methylation of the C-terminal &#x003b1;-carboxylate group of protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). Therefore, TYW4 was formerly referred to as PPM2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). In spite of the sequence similarity, these two enzymes catalyze modification reactions on completely distinct targets, protein and tRNA. Furthermore, TYW4 catalyzes two separate chemical reactions, whereas PPM1 catalyzes only one methylation reaction. Although the tertiary structure of PPM1 was revealed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>), the structural basis for these enzymological differences between PPM1 and TYW4, as well as the tRNA modification mechanism by TYW4 itself, still remains elusive. In addition, as compared to PPM1, TYW4 has an extra C-terminal extension, which has an unknown structure and function.</p><p>In order to gain insight into the modification mechanism by TYW4, we determined the crystal structure of TYW4 from <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>. The apo, SAM- and <italic>S</italic>-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH)-bound structures at 2.7, 2.5 and 1.7 &#x000c5; resolutions, respectively, revealed a structural transition dependent on cofactor binding, which may sequester the active site from solvent during the reaction and then expel the products after the reaction. The C-terminal domain forms a six-bladed &#x003b2; propeller structure, which participates in the formation of the putative binding pocket for yW at tRNA position 37. In conjunction with biochemical analyses by mass spectrometry, we showed that TYW4 catalyzes two reactions (i.e. methylation and methoxycarbonylation) with a single catalytic site. Furthermore, we showed that the latter methoxycarbonylation reaction proceeds through the fixation of CO<sub>2</sub>, which is distinctive from any other RNA modification mechanism.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Sample preparation</title><p>For the overproduction of yeast TYW4 with a 6&#x000d7; His tag at its C-terminus, the <italic>E. coli</italic> strain BL21(DE3) CodonPlus was transformed with the plasmid pET21b, carrying the TYW4 (YOL141w) gene. The cells were grown at 37&#x000b0;C in LB medium supplemented with 50 &#x003bc;g ml<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> ampicillin, to an absorbance at 600 nm of 0.6. Expression was induced at 20&#x000b0;C by the addition of isopropyl-&#x003b2;-<sc>d</sc>-thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 0.5 mM. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 8000<italic>g</italic> for 15 min, after overnight incubation. The cell pellets were resuspended in 50 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl buffer (pH 9.0), containing 100 mM NaCl, 50 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 10% glycerol and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and were gently sonicated. After centrifugation at 20 000<italic>g</italic> for 40 min, the supernatant containing TYW4 was loaded onto a Ni-NTA SuperFlow column (Qiagen), which was eluted with 200 mM imidazole in 10 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl buffer (pH 9.0), containing 300 mM NaCl, 50 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol. The eluted fractions were gathered, and then loaded onto a Resource Q column (GE Healthcare), which was eluted with a 20-column volume gradient of 0&#x02013;300 M NaCl in 10 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl buffer (pH 9.0), containing 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT). The fractions containing TYW4 were combined, concentrated and loaded onto a HiLoad 16/60 Superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare) equilibrated in 10 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl buffer (pH 9.0), containing 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol. The purified TYW4 fractions eluted from the gel-filtration column were collected and concentrated to 10 mg ml<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> by using an Amicon Ultra-4 filter (Millipore). The protein purity was assessed by SDS&#x02013;PAGE. To obtain selenomethionine-labeled proteins, the methionine-auxotroph <italic>E. coli</italic> strain B834(DE3) CodonPlus was transformed with the same plasmid. The cells were cultivated in Core medium (Wako, Japan) containing 50 &#x003bc;g ml<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> selenomethionine, and the protein was purified in the same manner as native TYW4.</p></sec><sec><title>Crystallization and data collection</title><p>The native crystals were obtained by the sitting-drop vapor diffusion method. The drops were prepared by mixing equal volumes of a 10 mg ml<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> TYW4 solution and reservoir solution, containing 200 mM ammonium citrate (pH 7.0), 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 20% (w/v) PEG3,350, 20 mM sodium citrate, and 1% 2-propanol. Two types of crystal were grown at 20&#x000b0;C in the same drop: the plate crystal (form I) and the column crystal (form II), which grew within 2 days and 7 days, respectively. However, the X-ray datasets revealed that only the form II crystal was suitable for the structure determination. The form II crystals of selenomethionine-labeled TYW4 were obtained by macro- and micro-seeding techniques, using the native crystals as a seed. The drops were prepared by mixing equal volumes of a 10 mg ml<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> TYW4 solution and the reservoir solution containing 200 mM ammonium citrate (pH 7.0) and 20% (w/v) PEG3,350. The form II crystals of the SAM- and SAH-bound TYW4 were also obtained by the micro-seeding technique as the selenomethionine-labeled crystals, with the exception that the protein solution contained 1 mM SAM or SAH. The crystals grew to a size of 0.02 mm &#x000d7; 0.02 mm &#x000d7; 0.01 mm in 1 day. The crystals were transferred stepwise to the harvesting solution, 240 mM ammonium citrate (pH 7.0) and 24% (w/v) PEG3,350, containing 15% (v/v) ethylene glycol as a cryoprotectant, and were flash-cooled in a liquid nitrogen stream at 100 K.</p></sec><sec><title>Data collection, structure determination, and refinement</title><p>All diffraction data sets were collected at the station BL41XU at SPring-8 (Hyogo, Japan) and the station NW12A at KEK PF-AR (Tsukuba, Japan). Datasets were processed with the HKL2000 suite (HKL Research). Despite the structural similarity of the N-terminal half of TYW4 and PPM1, attempts to solve the TYW4 structure by molecular replacement were unsuccessful. Therefore, the structure was solved by the multiwavelength anomalous dispersion (MAD) method, using the selenomethionine-labeled crystal. The 29 selenium sites were initially located by the programs SHELXC and SHELXD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>) with the dataset collected at the peak wavelength. The heavy-atom parameters were refined and the phases were calculated by using the program SHARP. The phase improvement, including the solvent flattening and averaging, and the automatic model building were performed with the program RESOLVE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Especially, the phase improvement with the solvent flattening and the 2-fold NCS averaging drastically improved the initial phases, which enabled the automatic interpretation of the electron density. The resulting initial model was manually modified to fit into the electron density maps by the program O (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). Finally, the atomic models of the apo, SAM- and SAH-bound forms of TYW4 were refined against reflections up to 2.7, 2.4 and 1.7 &#x000c5; resolutions, respectively, using the program PHENIX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>).

The overall structure of TYW4 consists of an N-terminal domain (TYW4N, 1&#x02013;350) and a C-terminal domain (TYW4C, 371&#x02013;694), connected by a linker region (351&#x02013;370) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). Both the apo and cofactor-bound form crystals contain two molecules per asymmetric unit. To determine whether TYW4 forms a dimer in solution, purified TYW4 was subjected to sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation. The result clearly showed that TYW4 exists as a monomer in solution with a molecular mass of &#x0223c;72 430 Da, which agrees with the molecular mass of 80 021.8 Da, calculated from the amino-acid sequence. This result is consistent with the observation that the molecular interface in the asymmetric unit contains many water molecules and lacks hydrophobic interactions. <fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Overall structure of TYW4.

PPM1 recognizes the C-terminal residues (-TPDYFL) of PP2A and transfers the methyl group from SAM to the &#x003b1;-carboxyl group of the Leu residue. This methylation at the C-terminus regulates the assembly of PP2A holoenzyme. The crystal structure of PPM1 revealed that it belongs to the class I SAM-dependent methyltransferases (MTases) and recognizes the cofactor with the conserved G<italic>X</italic>G motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>).</p><p>As expected from the amino-acid sequence, TYW4N has a similar tertiary structure to PPM1, and shares the core structure with the class I MTases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figures 2</xref>A, B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>A). The RMSD between TYW4N and PPM1 is 2.1 &#x000c5; (<italic>Z</italic> score of 32.7) over 327 C&#x003b1; atoms. However, there are three structural differences between the TYW4N and PPM1. First, TYW4N has a long additional &#x003b1; helix (14&#x02013;27, helix &#x003b1;1&#x02032;) at its N terminus, which is disordered in the apo form of PPM1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Second, the helices &#x003b1;2 and &#x003b1;3 in PPM1, which pack on the helix &#x003b1;1, are missing in TYW4N and replaced with a short insertion, consisting of 3<sub>10</sub> helices and loops (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). Finally, the tip of the &#x003b2;6bc hairpin (674&#x02013;684), which protrudes from TYW4C, is inserted into a gap formed between helices &#x003b1;5 and &#x003b1;8 and forms a tight interaction with them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A). In PPM1, this gap between helices &#x003b1;5 and &#x003b1;8 was suggested to be a binding site for the C-terminal tail of PP2A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B). As a result, the helix &#x003b1;5, which is disordered in PPM1, is clearly observed in the density map and has a low temperature factor as low as that for the other part of the protein. <fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Structural comparison of (<bold>A</bold>) TYW4 and (<bold>B</bold>) PPM1.

Consequently, the SAM-binding pocket is largely exposed to the solvent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A). The residues at the junction between helices &#x003b1;1&#x02032; and &#x003b1;1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29 B30 B31 B32">29&#x02013;32</xref>) are partially disordered, indicating its flexibility. In some MTases, co-purified SAM bound to the catalytic site was observed, even if no SAM molecule was added during the crystallization procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). However, in TYW4, we did not observe any density corresponding to co-purified SAM around the SAM-binding pocket.</p><p>To elucidate the cofactor-binding mechanism, we co-crystallized TYW4 with SAM or SAH.

The interactions between helices &#x003b1;1&#x02032; and &#x003b1;B observed in the apo form are completely lost, and the N terminus of helix &#x003b1;1&#x02032; protrudes into the solvent. The SAM molecule becomes deeply buried and sequestered from the solvent by the C-terminal half of helix &#x003b1;1&#x02032;. <fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p>Catalytic site of TYW4.

A similar structural change to that observed in the SAM-complexed crystal occurs in one molecule (molecule A) in the crystal asymmetric unit. However, interestingly, the structural change does not occur in the other molecule (molecule B) in the asymmetric unit, and the bound SAH molecule is largely exposed to the solvent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B).</p></sec><sec><title>Catalytic site structure</title><p>As described above, there are several residues commonly conserved between TYW4N and PPM1 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp158/DC1">Supplementary Figure 2</ext-link>). Among them, the residues involved in cofactor recognition, including the G<italic>X</italic>G motif, have quite similar conformations to those of PPM1. Reflecting this structural similarity, SAM or SAH is bound to TYW4N in a very similar manner to that observed in PPM1. Furthermore, there is a deep cavity in close vicinity to the bound cofactor, which is formed upon the structural change of helix &#x003b1;1&#x02032;. In this cavity, Arg88 and Tyr229, which are conserved between TYW4N and PPM1, are located near the &#x003b5;-methyl group of SAM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C). The guanidinium and hydroxyl groups of these residues might recognize the common structure of the substrate of TYW4 and PPM1, i.e. the carboxylate moiety, to situate it correctly for the nucleophilic attack.</p><p>There are several distinctive differences between TYW4N and PPM1 in this cavity. TYW4N has many conserved Tyr and Phe residues in this deep cavity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C), which are replaced with other amino-acid residues in PPM1. In PPM1, the gap between helices &#x003b1;5 and &#x003b1;8 forms a funnel-shaped cavity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B), whereas in TYW4, the &#x003b2;6bc hairpin from TYW4C is inserted between this gap to form the small and flat cavity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>D). Thus, these TYW4-specific structures may recognize the specific structure of the yW-72 residue in tRNA, such as its planar tricyclic ring or aliphatic side chain. Hence, we hereafter refer to this deep cavity as the putative yW-72-binding pocket.</p></sec><sec><title>The C terminal domain of TYW4 forms a beta-propeller structure</title><p>The present crystal structure revealed that TYW4C adopts a six-bladed &#x003b2;-propeller structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A). The topology diagram of TYW4C is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C. We hereafter refer to each of the blades as blade 1 to blade 6, and each &#x003b2; strand composing a blade as &#x02018;&#x003b2;a&#x02019; to &#x02018;&#x003b2;d&#x02019; (from the center to the periphery of the ring), and define the &#x02018;top&#x02019; and &#x02018;bottom&#x02019; sides as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figures 2</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>A. Well-known superfamilies with &#x003b2;-propeller structures are the WD-repeat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>) and Kelch-repeat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>), which both function as scaffold domains in macromolecular protein complexes. A structural homology search with the DALI algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>) indicated that TYW4C shares high structural similarity with the Kelch-repeat proteins, especially that of the Keap1 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B). The RMSD between TYW4C and the Keap1 Kelch domain is 2.3 &#x000c5; (<italic>Z</italic> score of 25.5) over 246 C&#x003b1; atoms. Despite the lack of detectable sequence homology between TYW4C and Keap1, the structure-based sequence alignment showed that they share several features, even in their primary structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C). The &#x02018;<italic>GG</italic> motif&#x02019; immediately after the &#x003b2;b strand, which is commonly observed in Kelch repeats, is also strictly conserved in all blades of TYW4C. An Arg residue between the &#x003b2;d and &#x003b2;a strands, which is also conserved in typical Kelch repeats, is conserved in blades 1, 2, 3 and 5 of TYW4C. However, other key signature motifs commonly observed in Kelch repeats (i.e. Tyr and Trp residues on the &#x003b2;c and &#x003b2;d strands, respectively) are not conserved. Consequently, the sequence as well as the structural similarity among the blades of TYW4C is lower than those of the Keap1 Kelch domain. <fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p>The &#x003b2;-propeller structure of the TYW4 C-terminal domain (TYW4C).

First, in the Keap1 Kelch domain, the propeller's ring structure is closed with the C-terminal &#x003b2; strand, and its N and C termini are located around the center of the ring. By contrast, in TYW4C, the ring structure is closed with the N-terminal &#x003b2; strand, and its N and C termini residing at the periphery of the ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A). Thus, the &#x003b2; propeller of TYW4C has a similar topology to that of the galactose oxidases (e.g. PDBID: 1GOH). Second, blade 5 of TYW4C has an extra &#x003b2; strand (&#x003b2;5e) at the periphery of the ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A). As a result, the N and C termini of the domain are about 21 &#x000c5; apart, which is distinct from the typical &#x003b2; propeller structures of Kelch as well as WD repeats, in which their N and C termini are adjacent &#x003b2; strands in the same blade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B). Third, there is no helix in the Keap1 Kelch domain, whereas TYW4C has several &#x003b1; and 3<sub>10</sub> helices between blades (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A).</p></sec><sec><title><italic>In vivo</italic> complementation and <italic>in vitro</italic> reconstitution analyses by mass spectrometry</title><p>To clarify the mechanism of the methoxycarbonylation reaction, we performed <italic>in vitro</italic> reconstitution of the TYW4 reaction, using the recombinant enzyme prepared by the same method as the crystallization sample. The result clearly showed the direct conversion from yW-72 to yW by TYW4 alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A). We can rule out the possibility of the involvement of other proteins or organic compounds co-purified from the <italic>E. coli</italic> lysate in this catalysis, since we did not observe any electron density corresponding to them in the present crystal structure. Given that the methyl group in the methoxycarbonyl moiety originates from SAM, the compounds that can be a source of the carboxyl group are follows: SAM, Tris, DTT, and carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) dissolved from the air atmosphere. It is unlikely that SAM acts as both a methyl and methoxycarbonyl donor, since the &#x003b1;-carboxyl group of the enzyme-bound SAM is distant from the catalytic pocket (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A). To further explore the methoxycarbonylation mechanism, we performed <italic>in vitro</italic> reconstitution of the TYW4 reaction with <sup>13</sup>C-labeled sodium bicarbonate, followed mass spectrometry analysis. Intriguingly, the result showed an obvious change in the isotope distribution of the anticodon fragment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B and C). In the presence of NaH<sup>13</sup>CO<sub>3</sub>, the mass of the most abundant fragment was shifted by +1 Da (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B, upper panel), indicating the incorporation of <sup>13</sup>C from NaH<sup>13</sup>CO<sub>3</sub> to yW. However, the small amount of the monoisotopic peak of the fragment containing the <sup>12</sup>C atom (&#x02018;a&#x02019; in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B upper panel and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>C left panel) was also detected. This peak may stem from <sup>12</sup>CO<sub>2</sub> contamination in the reaction buffer from the air atmosphere.

This structural change should enable the seclusion of the catalytic site from the solvent molecules to ensure the correct reaction. Furthermore, molecule B of the present crystal structure of the SAH-bound form has an open form structure, even when SAH is bound to the SAM-binding pocket. Therefore, in this structure, the SAH molecule is exposed to the solvent and ready to be released from the SAM-binding pocket.</p><p>A detailed inspection of the present structures provides insight into the mechanism of this structural change. As already discussed, helices &#x003b1;1&#x02032; and &#x003b1;1 form a continuous helix, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A, after the SAM binding. However, the main chain conformation at the junction region deviates from that in an ideal &#x003b1; helix. More precisely, the main chain carbonyl oxygen of Ile27 makes hydrogen bond with the &#x003b3;-OH group of the conserved Thr30 side chain (2.7 &#x000c5;) and is distant from the main chain amide nitrogen of Asn31 (4.3 &#x000c5;), which is a hydrogen-bonding donor in the ideal &#x003b1; helix. Instead, the main chain amide nitrogen of Asn31 is located near the main chain carbonyl oxygen of Gln28 (3.5 &#x000c5;). Therefore, this junction region (residues 27&#x02013;31) forms not an &#x003b1;- but a 3<sub>10</sub>-helical structure, which is structurally perturbed by the interaction with the Thr30 side chain. Since a 3<sub>10</sub> helix is structurally more unstable than an &#x003b1; helix, it may enable the bending of the helix at this junction region.</p><p>Furthermore, we propose that the conserved Thr30 at this 3<sub>10</sub>-helical junction region might function to sense the charge state of the cofactor to trigger the structural transition of the helix &#x003b1;1&#x02032;. In the SAM-bound form, the &#x003b3;-OH group of Thr30 interacts with the sulfonium group of SAM (3.8 &#x000c5;, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A). The positive charge of the sulfonium group of SAM can be stabilized by the lone pair electrons of the &#x003b3;-OH group of Thr30. Furthermore, the sulfonium group, the &#x003b3;-OH group of Thr30 and the main chain carbonyl oxygen of Ile27 form an interaction network, involving the aforementioned 3<sub>10</sub> helical structure. Therefore, the bound SAM molecule may stabilize the closed form <italic>via</italic> this interaction network. In contrast, the thioether group of SAH is not charged and bears a lone pair of electrons. After the reaction, the interaction between the lone pair electrons of the &#x003b3;-OH group of Thr30 and the sulfur atom of SAH may be destabilized. As a result, in molecule B in the SAH-complexed crystal, helix &#x003b1;1&#x02032; was in the open form structure, despite the cofactor binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>B). However, it should be noted that, in molecule A in the SAH-complexed crystal, the enzyme was still in the closed form, and the &#x003b3;-OH group of Thr30 was still situated near the thioether group of SAH. It is possible that some stabilization effect by the crystalline environment around molecule A might overcome the destabilization by the SAH binding discussed above.</p><p>In the previous structural analysis of yeast PPM1, Leulliot and coworkers reported that no conformational change was observed between the free- and cofactor-bound forms in PPM1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). However, a reinvestigation of these structures suggests that a structural change similar to that observed in TYW4 may also occur in PPM1. At first, in the free form structure of PPM1 (PDB ID: 1RJF), eight residues at its N terminus are disordered, which may corresponds to the open form. By contrast, in the SAM- and SAH-bound structures (PDB ID: 1RJD and 1RJE), seven residues (Glu2&#x02013;Thr8) at its N terminus are ordered, forming a small &#x003b1; helix that corresponds to helix &#x003b1;1&#x02032; of TYW4N. The main-chain structure of the junction region between this small &#x003b1;1&#x02032; and &#x003b1;1 in PPM1 also deviates from the ideal &#x003b1;-helical geometry, and forms a 3<sub>10</sub>-helical structure, as observed in TYW4N. Moreover, Thr30, at the junction of &#x003b1;1&#x02032; and &#x003b1;1 in TYW4N, is also conserved as Thr8 in PPM1. Therefore, this small helix &#x003b1;1&#x02032; and the conserved Thr residue of PPM1 may have roles similar to those proposed for TYW4.</p></sec><sec><title>Role of the C-terminal beta propeller domain</title><p>The present study revealed that TYW4C adopts a &#x003b2;-propeller structure and belongs to the Kelch repeat superfamily, which was observed in several proteins related to cellular signaling pathways, such as actin association, cell morphology and organization, and gene expression regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). In these cellular events, these proteins act as adaptor by capturing their partners by the Kelch-repeat domain. The structural comparison revealed that TYW4C has a quite similar structure to the C-terminal Kelch repeat domain of Keap1. The C-terminal Kelch domain of Keap1 binds the Neh2 domain of the downstream transcription factor Nrf2, and the N-terminal domain of Keap1 recruits Nrf2 to the ubiquitin ligase complex for eventual degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). In the Keap1 Kelch domain, the interaction sites for Nrf2 exist at the additional &#x003b2; hairpins between the &#x003b2;b and &#x003b2;c strands and at the linker between the blades, which are located at the bottom side of the ring. The complex structure of Keap1 Kelch domain and Neh2 peptide showed that their complex formation is based on a complementary electrostatic interaction, in which the basic residues at the bottom of Keap1 recognize the acidic motif conserved in the Neh2 domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>E).</p><p>In TYW4, TYW4C interacts with TYW4N on its bottom side, to insert its &#x003b2;6bc hairpin into the gap near the catalytic site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). In this inter-subdomain interaction, the conserved basic residues (Arg460 and Arg492) of TYW4C provide electrostatic interactions for the conserved acidic residues (Asp331 and Glu334) in Region IV of TYW4N (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>D). Although there is no distinct similarity between the TYW4C and Keap1 sequences, these basic residues involved in the interaction are conserved between TYW4C and Keap1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C, D and E). Consequently, the interaction manner between TYW4C and TYW4N is strikingly similar to that between Keap1 and Neh2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>E). Mutational analyses of <italic>&#x00394;</italic>TYW4C showed that TYW4C is not required for the catalysis, but considerably enhances the catalytic efficiency (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>). These mutational results suggest the importance of the electrostatic interactions between TYW4C and TYW4N discussed above, for correctly inserting the &#x003b2;6bc hairpin into the gap between helices &#x003b1;5 and &#x003b1;8. The correct insertion of the &#x003b2;6bc hairpin will place Tyr678 and Phe680, which are at the tip of this hairpin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C and D), in the gap between helices &#x003b1;5 and &#x003b1;8 to generate the flattened, hydrophobic yW-72-binding pocket</p><p>In plants, an ORF encoding a continuous TYW2, 3 and TYW4C-like sequence was found, suggesting that the TYW2, 3, and TYW4C domains are expressed as one polypeptide, TYW3-4C-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Furthermore, the species expressing TYW3-4C-2 lack the ORF corresponding to TYW4N. These species only have a single ORF belonging to the PPM1 family (hereafter referred to as PPM1/TYW4N), which strongly suggests that the PPM1/TYW4N protein has dual functions to methylate both the PP2A polypeptide and tRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). The amino-acid sequence of the plant TYW4C ORF shares high homology with yeast TYW4C, which suggests that the plant TYW4C also has a similar &#x003b2; propeller structure to the yeast TYW4C. Moreover, the amino-acid sequence of the &#x003b2;6bc hairpin is also well conserved in the TYW4C domain of TYW3-4C-2 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp158/DC1">Supplementary Figure 3</ext-link>). Therefore, it is likely that the TYW4C-like domain of TYW3-4C-2 may interact with PPM1/TYW4N by an electrostatic interaction and insert its &#x003b2;6bc hairpin into the PP2A-binding pocket. These inter-molecular interactions may switch the substrate specificity of PPM1/TYW4N from the PP2A polypeptide to yW-72 at tRNA position 37, by altering the shape of the substrate-binding cavity.</p></sec><sec><title>Methoxycarbonylation mechanism by TYW4</title><p>A previous <italic>in vitro</italic> biochemical analysis suggested that TYW4 may catalyze two independent reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Hereafter, we refer to the methylation of the &#x003b1;-carboxyl group as reaction I and to the methoxycarbonylation of the &#x003b1;-amino groups as reaction II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). As discussed above, the present crystal structure strongly suggests that reaction I may have a similar mechanism to that of PPM1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A). <fig id="F7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p>Proposed catalytic mechanism of reaction I (<bold>A</bold>) and reaction II (<bold>B</bold>) by TYW4.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkp158f7"/></fig></p><p>The present biochemical results clearly showed the incorporation of <sup>13</sup>C from <sup>13</sup>C-labeled bicarbonate into the yW nucleotide in tRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>C). Based on our results, we propose that reaction II occurs by the following two steps: i) carboxylation of the &#x003b1;-amino group of the &#x003b1;-amino-&#x003b1;-carboxypropyl (acp) side chain by CO<sub>2</sub> and ii) methylation of the resultant carbamate group by SAM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B). The formation of a carbamate group at a specific amino group by the addition of carbon dioxide has been observed in several enzymes, such as haemoglobin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>), ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase (Rubisco) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>) and dethiobiotin synthetase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>). In these enzymes, a carbamate group is formed by the nucleophilic attack of an uncharged protein amino group upon CO<sub>2</sub>. Therefore, we hypothesize that reaction II proceeds by the addition of not a bicarbonate ion, but a CO<sub>2</sub> molecule. Moreover, for this reaction, a general base catalyst deprotonates the protein amino group, while a general acid catalyst, such as Arg, Lys, or a metal ion, interacts with CO<sub>2</sub> to increase its electrophilicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). In TYW4, the &#x003b1;-amino group of the acp side chain may be deprotonated by a general base catalyst and attack the CO<sub>2</sub> molecule bound to the enzyme. In addition, the N-C bond of the carbamate is labile, and thus the carbamate formation is highly reversible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). We hypothesize that the carbamate group thus formed may subsequently be methylated by SAM. This methylation may form a stable methoxycarbonyl group, resulting in CO<sub>2</sub> fixation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B).</p></sec><sec><title>The catalytic site of TYW4 for two chemical reactions</title><p>The present biochemical analysis showed that TYW4 can catalyze both reactions I and II. Our crystal structure revealed that TYW4 possesses only one SAM-binding pocket in the TYW4N domain. It is unlikely that the TYW4C domain has another catalytic site for reaction II, since the <italic>&#x00394;</italic>TYW4C mutant can complement the activity for complete yW formation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>). Therefore, we propose that both reactions I and II may occur at the same catalytic site. The SAM molecule utilized in reaction II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B) may bind the same SAM-binding pocket as that for reaction I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A). The methylation of the carbamate by SAM in reaction II may occur via the same mechanism as the methylation in reaction I.</p><p>As described above, the putative yW-72-binding pocket is formed by helix &#x003b1;1&#x02032;, &#x003b1;1 of region I, &#x003b1;5 of region IV, and the &#x003b2;6bc hairpin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figures 3</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>D). This pocket has a flat, deep shape and may snugly fit the bulky structure of the tricyclic ring of the yW-72 base. This pocket is also deep enough to accommodate the apc side chain of the yW-72 base. The methyl group of SAM and the side chains of Arg88 and Tyr229 are situated at the bottom of this pocket. Therefore, the pocket has a shape complementary to the molecular surface of yW-72. These findings allowed us to construct a docking model of yW-72, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>. In this model, the acp side chain can be accommodated in the pocket in two different modes for reactions I and II described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>B and C). The &#x003b1;-carboxyl and &#x003b1;-amino groups are directed to the SAM side for their methylation and methoxycarbonylation, respectively. The flexible aliphatic moiety of the acp side chain may allow it to bind in two different conformations. In reaction I, the side chains of Arg88 and Tyr229 may recognize the &#x003b1;-carboxyl group to fix it in the vicinity of the &#x003b5;-methyl group of SAM. In contrast, in reaction II, the phenolic hydroxyl group of Tyr229 can act a general base catalyst to deprotonate the &#x003b1;-amino group of yW-72 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figures 7</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>C). Arg88 may interact with CO<sub>2</sub> to activate it for this nucleophilic attack. Actually, the R88A mutant was completely unable to complement the <italic>&#x00394;TYW4</italic> yeast strain, highlighting the importance of Arg88 in both of the reactions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>).

The present structure, combined with a sequence alignment from other species, provides insights into the tRNA recognition mechanism. The loop encompassing residues 70&#x02013;79 in Region I is conserved in TYW4N, but is replaced with helices &#x003b1;2 and &#x003b1;3 in PPM1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). This region contains conserved basic residues (Arg77 and Lys76) and forms a positively charged patch near the entrance of the putative yW-72-binding pocket (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>A). Especially, this loop and the basic residues are also conserved in plant PPM1, which is proposed to be a dual-function enzyme (i.e. tRNA and PP2A modifications), as described above. Therefore, it is possible that this basic region recognizes the phosphate groups adjacent to the target residue, position 37, in tRNA<sup>Phe</sup>. Furthermore, another conserved basic patch is formed on the TYW4C surface near the catalytic site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>B).

The present biochemical analysis revealed that TYW4C is not required for the catalysis, but considerably enhances the complementation activity. We speculate that TYW4C not only generates the yW-72-specific pocket with its &#x003b2;6bc hairpin, but also provides a tRNA-binding site on its basic surface, thereby facilitating the efficient catalysis by TYW4N.

In TYW4, the N-terminal domain shares structural similarity with PPM1 whose substrate is a protein, whereas the C-terminal domain belongs to the Kelch repeat superfamily, which is observed in adaptor proteins involved in cellular signaling pathways. Our results revealed that the &#x003b2;6bc hairpin of the C-terminal domain is inserted into the gap near the catalytic site of the N-terminal domain, thereby changing the substrate specificity from a protein peptide to a hypermodified nucleoside in tRNA.</p><p>Moreover, our biochemical analysis suggested the novel catalytic mechanism of TYW4. The methoxycarbonylation reaction may proceed through carbamate formation with CO<sub>2</sub> and methylation with SAM, which results in CO<sub>2</sub> fixation. Since CO<sub>2</sub> is the most oxidized state of carbon, its fixation into solid organic compounds requires a large energy input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). In this reaction, the highly reactive sulfonium group in SAM may supply this energy required for CO<sub>2</sub> fixation. SAM is a multifunctional cofactor that acts as a source of various chemical groups, such as methyl, ribosyl, and aminoalkyl groups, as well as a source of radicals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>). The present results would define a new role of SAM, as a high energy source in CO<sub>2</sub> fixation.</p><p>Finally, the present crystal structures suggested the discrimination mechanism of SAM and its near-cognate ligand, SAH, by TYW4. In some MTases and a SAM-responsive riboswitch, a comparison of the SAM- and SAH-bound crystal structures revealed that the cofactors were bound in different conformations, which are considered to enable the discrimination between SAM and SAH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>). The discrimination mechanism by TYW4 is unique in that the structural transition of the enzyme, but not the cofactor, enables the discrimination between SAM and SAH.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkp158/DC1">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>National Project on Protein Structural and Functional Analyses from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) (to O.N. and T.S.); grants from MEXT (to R.I. and O.N.); Mitsubishi Foundation grants (to O.N.); grant from the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO) (to T.S.), JSPS Fellowship for Japanese Junior Scientists (to A.N.).
