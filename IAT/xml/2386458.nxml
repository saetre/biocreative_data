Studies of embryonic stem (ES) cells have revealed molecular mechanisms that govern pluripotency involving in both genetic and epigenetic mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Three transcription factors Oct3/4, Sox2 and Nanog are regarded as pivotal regulators because the loss-of-function experiments confirmed their essential functions for maintenance of pluripotency in ES cells as well as in peri-implantation development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Moreover, the gain-of-function experiments emphasize their function associated to pluripotency. Nanog overexpression supports self-renewal of mouse ES cells in the absence of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and promote imposition of pluripotency on somatic cells after cell-fusion with ES cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], whereas ectopic expression of Oct3/4 and Sox2 with additional two transcription factors Klf4 and cMyc is sufficient to induce pluripotency in embryonic and adult fibroblast cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Oct3/4 co-operates with Sox2 to activate transcription of the target genes including Oct3/4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], Sox2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and Nanog [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. It has been recently shown that Sox2 is essential to maintain expression of Oct3/4 in ES cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], suggesting that these three transcription factors form a network to maintain pluripotency.</p><p>In addition to Oct3/4, Sox2 and Nanog, other putative transcription factors expressing pluripotent stem cells in stem-cell-specific manner have been identified. Rex1 (for <underline>r</underline>educed <underline>ex</underline>pression-1, also known as <italic>Zfp42</italic>) was first identified a gene that expresses in F9 embryonal carcinoma (EC) cells and is down-regulated after retinoic acid (RA) treatment to induce differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. This gene encodes a C2H2 zinc-finger protein that is closely similar to Yy1, an evolutionally-conserved component of polycomb-related complex 2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Its highly-specific expression in pluripotent stem cells has been confirmed in mouse and human ES cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], making it one of the most famous markers of pluripotency tested in various stem cells such as multipotent adult progenitor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and amniotic fluid cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. However, its function in ES cells has not yet been characterized well although it has been reported that a targeted deletion of <italic>Rex1 </italic>results in loss of the ability to differentiate into visceral endoderm induced by RA in F9 EC cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], and that a gene silencing by RNA interference for Rex1 results in loss of capacity to self-renew in ES cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>In this paper, we report our results of functional assay of Rex1 in ES cells as well as in embryos. Over-expression of Rex1 in ES cells neither induces differentiation in the presence of LIF nor maintains self-renewal in the absence of LIF. <italic>Rex1</italic>-/- ES cells can be established and contribute whole embryos after blastocyst injection, indicating that they possess proper pluripotency. <italic>Rex1</italic>-/- mice were produced by the intercross of heterozygotes, and both male and female homozygotes were normal and fertile. Our data proofed that Rex1 is dispensable for maintenance of pluripotency beyond the shadow of a doubt.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Generation of gain- and loss-of-function mutant ES cell lines for <italic>Rex1</italic></title><p>To analyze the precise function of <italic>Rex1 </italic>in the maintenance of pluripotency, we generated a series of genetically-engineered ES cell lines for its gain- and loss-of function analyses. For loss-of-function analysis, we disrupted the endogenous <italic>Rex1 </italic>allele by conventional gene targeting via homologous recombination in ES cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). The knock-out (KO) allele should be a functionally null allele because the first 100 bp of the open reading frame in the exon 4 including the start codon was replaced by the <italic>pacEGFP </italic>chimeric gene cassette containing the puromycin-resistant gene (<italic>pac</italic>) and the green fluorescent protein (<italic>Egfp</italic>) cDNA. Interestingly, all of the puromycin-resistant clones obtained by transfection of this KO vector carried the correctly targeted alleles. One of the <italic>Rex1</italic>+/- ES cell line (RKPG9) was cultured with high-dose puromycin to obtain the <italic>Rex1</italic>-/- ES cell lines generated via spontaneous gene conversion. As the result, multiple <italic>Rex1</italic>-/- ES cell lines were established with extremely high efficiency (4 of 4 clones obtained after the selection were homozygous for <italic>Rex1 </italic>KO allele). Correct targeting events were confirmed by the loss of the polymorphic signature of the wild-type allele on the southern blot analysis of the genomic DNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>), in which the 5.6 kb fragment corresponds to the <italic>Rex1 </italic>pseudogene on chromosome 15 reported previously as well as found in the mouse genome data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Northern blot revealed the loss of the transcript derived from the wild-type allele in <italic>Rex1</italic>-/- ES cells, which express the large transcripts composed by the truncated <italic>Rex1 </italic>and <italic>pacEGFP </italic>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). <italic>Rex1-/- </italic>ES cells were also established by introduction of the second knockout vector carrying the hygromycin-resistant gene as a selection marker into <italic>Rex1+/- </italic>ES cells with <italic>pacEGFP </italic>followed by the selection with hygromycin B. Genotyping of 5 drug-resistant clones revealed that 2 clones were <italic>Rex1+/- </italic>and 3 clones were <italic>Rex1-/-</italic>, indicating that Rex1-/- ES cells were able to be established without selection pressure (data not shown). Easy isolation of the Rex1-/- ES cells suggested that the <italic>Rex1 </italic>function is not essential for self-renewal of ES cells.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Generation of ES cells with various <italic>Rex1 </italic>genotypes</bold>. <bold>A</bold>.

Since the strong activity of the CAG expression unit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], the bi-cistronic design of the expression vector with <italic>internal ribosome entry site </italic>(<italic>IRES</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] and the character of the zeocin selection system, in which high level expression of the zeocin-resistant gene (<italic>zeo</italic>) is required for the host cells to survive in the medium containing 40 &#x003bc;g/ml of zeocin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], all of the resulting transfectants express <italic>Rex1 </italic>cDNA at comparative or higher level to that of the endogenous <italic>Rex1 </italic>gene in the wild-type ES cells. Since the efficiency to obtain the zeocin-resistant clones was not different between wild-type and <italic>Rex1</italic>-/-ES cells, the over-expression might not affect self-renewal of ES cells (data not shown).</p><p>As the results of these gene manipulations, we established ES cell lines with four different genotypes for <italic>Rex1</italic>; ES cells carrying the wild-type <italic>Rex1 </italic>alleles and the empty CAG-IZ vector (wt), the wild-type <italic>Rex1 </italic>alleles and the <italic>Rex1 </italic>transgene (wt-Tg), the <italic>Rex1</italic>-/- alleles and the empty vector (KO), and the <italic>Rex1</italic>-/- alleles and the <italic>Rex1 </italic>transgene (KO-Tg). Since the <italic>Rex1</italic>-Tg express <italic>Rex1 </italic>at twice levels of the endogenous <italic>Rex1</italic>, the wt-Tg ES cell lines express <italic>Rex1 </italic>at three times more than the wild-type ES cells as the sum of endogenous and exogenous transcripts, whereas the KO-Tg lines express at the twice levels of the wt ES cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D, E</xref>). Both Tg ES cells express Rex1 at the half level of the wt ES cells from the constitutively-active transgene irrespective to the culture condition, whereas the endogenous <italic>Rex1 </italic>gene is down-regulated immediately after induction of differentiation by either withdrawal of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) or formation of embryoid bodies (EBs) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Minor effects of <italic>Rex1 </italic>on the pluripotency-associated transcriptome</title><p>First we tested <italic>Rex1</italic>-dependent transcription in ES cells since the Rex1 protein may function as a transcription factor like its most homologous protein Yy1. Indeed, we confirmed that the chimeric Rex1 proteins with Egfp-tag and HA-tag localize in nuclei (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). One of the important functions of Yy1 is mediated by the interaction with the polycomb related complexes (PRCs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], and it was reported that Yy1 directly interact to PRCs and recruit them to the targets in sequence-specific manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Recently, the functional importance of PRCs in ES cells to repress differentiation-related genes has been disclosed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Gene expression profiles were qualitatively examined by the microarray analyses of two <italic>Rex1</italic>-/- ES cells (HP3 and HP4), and one wild-type ES cells (EB5), revealing that very few genes showed significant differences in their expression levels between wild-type and <italic>Rex1</italic>-/- ES cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). A pair-wise comparison of <italic>Rex1+/+ </italic>ES cells (EB5) and <italic>Rex1-/- </italic>ES cells (HP3) (false discovery rate (FDR) &#x0003c; 0.05, gene expression difference &#x0003e; 2-fold) showed only 116 genes whose expression levels were significantly different. Among them, 30 genes were up-regulated in <italic>Rex1</italic>-/- ES cells (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>), whereas 86 genes were down-regulated (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). To verify the relationship between the expressions of these genes and the <italic>Rex1 </italic>genotypes, we quantified the expression levels in each three wt, wt+Tg, KO and KO+Tg ES cell lines by quantitative RT-PCR (QPCR). As a result, 3 genes (<italic>Mylpf, Lgals1 </italic>and <italic>Dusp14</italic>) were identified as putative Rex1 target genes since their expressions were down-regulated in KO ES cells, which were restored in KO-Tg ES cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). These data suggested that Rex1 may functions as a transcription factor although its impact on the maintenance of the pluripotency-assocoated transcriptome is very faint.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Nuclear localization of Rex1</bold>.

All ES cell lines propagated at the comparable growth rate and kept normal morphology (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). Gene expression analysis by QPCR revealed no remarkable change among them for several pluripotency-associated markers such as Oct3/4 and Nanog (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref> and data not shown). All these ES cells completely undergo morphological differentiation for 5 days after withdrawal of LIF (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>) with accompanying the up-regulation of a set of primitive endoderm markers such as <italic>Gata4 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], <italic>Gata6 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] and <italic>Disabled homolog 2 </italic>(<italic>Dab2</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] (data not shown).

The growth and morphology of EBs were indistinguishable among these ES cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>), indicating that the differentiation ability of KO ES cells was obviously unaffected and persistent expression of Rex1 from the constitutively-active Tg does not affect differentiation event in this context.

However, the induction of two visceral endoderm marker genes, <italic>Transthyretin </italic>(<italic>Ttr</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] and <italic>Indian hedgehog </italic>(<italic>Ihh</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], were reduced in EBs derived from KO ES cells, which were restored in KO-Tg ES-derived EBs, indicating that this phenotype is depend on the expression of <italic>Rex1 </italic>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). Interestingly, the induction level of the Sry-related transcription factor <italic>Sox7</italic>, which also expresses in visceral endoderm in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], was also reduced in KO ES-derived EBs and restored in KO-Tg ES-derived EBs, suggesting its involvement in visceral endoderm differentiation. However, the visceral endoderm differentiation might not completely perturbed in the absence of <italic>Rex1 </italic>because <italic>Alphafetoprotein </italic>(<italic>Afp</italic>), which is an archetypal marker for visceral endoderm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], was normally induced in EBs derived from KO ES cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). In contrast, the parietal endoderm markers <italic>Sparc </italic>(<italic>secreted acidic cysteine rich glycoprotein</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] and <italic>Plat </italic>(<italic>tPA; plasminogen activator, tissue</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], were equally induced in EBs irrespective to their genotypes for <italic>Rex1 </italic>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>).

In ES cells, microarray analysis, SAGE and in silico subtraction of EST database have been identified several genes specifically expressing in undifferentiated ES cells. Among them, <italic>Rex1 </italic>is one of the oldest marker genes of undifferentiated pluripotent stem cells first reported on 1989 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Since then, the function of <italic>Rex1 </italic>has been kept as a mystery, but here we finally revealed its dispensability to maintain cellular pluripotency.</p><p><italic>Rex1 </italic>was first identified as the gene which expression is repressed by RA in F9 EC cells. A deletion of <italic>Rex1 </italic>from F9 cells resulted in the loss of ability to differentiate into visceral endoderm induced by RA and cyclic AMP analogs without no phenotypical change in their undifferentiated state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], which is consistent with our result shown here. In contrast, it was recently reported that RNAi-mediated silencing of <italic>Rex1 </italic>in ES cells prevents self-renewal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The controversy between the phenotypes of gene-targeting and gene-silencing might be derived from the different kinetics of silencing or the strong bias of the selection of homozygous mutant ES cells that allow establishment of adopted ES cells for the absence of the particular gene function. Although both might be the case for <italic>Rex1</italic>, neither ES cells nor mouse embryos show any phenotype in the maintenance of pluripotency, suggesting that the imperfect target specificity of gene-silencing by RNAi might be most responsible to give the discrepancy in this case since the expression vector to generate large double-strand RNA was applied in the above report.</p><p>Why does the function of <italic>Rex1 </italic>revealed here look so minor although the previous reports suggested its importance in ES cells as the common target of the pluripotency-associated transcription factors Oct3/4, Sox2 and Nanog [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>] as well as the component of the protein-interaction network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]? One simple explanation is functional redundancy between <italic>Rex1 </italic>and its related gene(s) present in the genome. <italic>Rex1 </italic>encodes the C2H2-type zinc-finger whose sequence is most similar to the transcription factor Yy1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. <italic>Yy1 </italic>widely expresses in various tissues in embryos and adults and its function is essential for peri-implantation development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Since <italic>Rex1 </italic>express in inner cell mass of the blastocyst-stage embryos and its expression is down-regulated after implantation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>], the pre-implantation development of <italic>Yy1</italic>-null embryos might be supported by the overlapped function of <italic>Rex1 </italic>and its down-regulation after implantation might cause their lethality. The function of <italic>Yy1 </italic>is pleiotropic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and one of them is the function to recruit PRCs to the specific target sequences to repress the transcription of the target genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Although the several reports showed the function of the polycomb complex for the maintenance of pluripotency in ES cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], the function of <italic>Yy1 </italic>in pluripotent stem cells has yet been confirmed. Since <italic>Yy1 </italic>expresses in ES cells, it may mask the phenotype of the <italic>Rex1</italic>-/- ES cells by the functional redundancy. It was recently reported that <italic>Rex1 </italic>is a pseudogene generated from <italic>Yy1 </italic>by retrotransposition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. The zinc-finger domain of Yy1 is encoded by 3 exons whereas that of Rex1 is encoded in a single exon, and <italic>Yy1 </italic>is evolutionally conserved in all vertebrates, whereas <italic>Rex1 </italic>is found only in placental mammals. This hypothesis suggests that <italic>Yy1 </italic>occupies the major role in the redundant function to <italic>Rex1 </italic>and <italic>vice versa</italic>. The specific function of <italic>Rex1 </italic>to induce particular markers in visceral endoderm might be conducted by its different preference of the target sequence from Yy1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>] or down-regulation of <italic>Yy1 </italic>in this cell type.</p><p>The most prominent phenotype of the <italic>Rex1 </italic>deficiency is the poor induction of a subset of visceral endoderm marker genes. In the case of F9 EC cells, the null mutation for <italic>Rex1 </italic>completely prevent differentiation of visceral endoderm induced by RA and cAMP analogs, which was evaluated by the complete loss of induction of one of the visceral endoderm markers, <italic>Afp</italic>. In contrast, in ES cells, the suspension culture allows induction of visceral endoderm without any small molecule inducers, and the loss of <italic>Rex1 </italic>affects the induction of <italic>Ttr </italic>and <italic>Ihh</italic>, but not <italic>Afp</italic>. How can the <italic>Rex1 </italic>deficiency modulate the expression of the visceral endoderm marker genes although its expression is tightly restricted in pluripotent stem cells and down-regulated during their differentiation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref> and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>])? One possible explanation is that the gene(s) expressing in the pluripotent stem cells under the control of Rex1 might induce the gene(s) in the visceral endoderm adjacent to them in EBs like the case of <italic>Fibroblast growth factor-4 </italic>(<italic>Fgf4</italic>), which is produced by the pluripotent stem cells and acts as a paracrine growth factor for the extra-embryonic endoderm cells and the trophectoderm cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. However, the functional significance of the reduced levels of these visceral endoderm markers associated to the <italic>Rex1 </italic>deficiency should be very minor because the <italic>Rex1</italic>-null embryos are absolutely capable to develop normally in early embryogenesis.</p><p>It is a surprise that this is the first report of the <italic>Rex1 </italic>knockout mice because this gene was discovered 18 years ago, has been regarded as an important marker of pluripotent stem cells, and the generation of the heterozygous ES cell line via gene-trap was reported in 1992 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. The cell-type-specific expressions of genes have been regarded as good landmarks of their functions. Indeed, <italic>Oct3/4 </italic>and <italic>Nanog </italic>show highly specific expression in pluripotent stem cells in vitro as well as in vivo and exhibit essential function to maintain pluripotency. However, there are several exceptions of this relationship in the genes specifically express in pluripotent stem cells. In the cases of <italic>Fbxo15</italic>, <italic>Sox15 </italic>and <italic>Dppa5/Esg1</italic>, the null mutant embryos for them show no abnormality and the null ES cells are capable to be established and maintained although their expression is as tightly restricted in pluripotent stem cells as the case of <italic>Oct3/4 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. The discrepancy between the specific expression and the function in pluripotent stem cells might due to the global down-regulation of gene expression during differentiation of pluripotent stem cells via epigenetic mechanism. It was discovered that the epigenetic repression of gene expression is quite loose in the pluripotent stem cells, which is established during their differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. In addition, the cell-cycle regulation is also dramatically altered during differentiation since the S-phase is enriched in ES cells whereas the G1 phase is predominant in differentiated cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. Therefore, no specific transcriptional regulation might be required for genes to exhibit the stem-cell-specific expression pattern especially if their expressions depend on the cell-cycle. Indeed, in the case of <italic>Rex1</italic>, the octamer motif for the binding of Oct3/4 identified in the mouse <italic>Rex1 </italic>promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] is not conserved in the human <italic>Rex1 </italic>promoter based on the Ensembl database search, although the previous reports confirmed that both are capable to direct stem-cell-specific transgene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], suggesting that the Oct3/4-independent regulation might be critical for its stem-cell-specific expression.</p><p>This is not the end of the story of <italic>Rex1</italic>, however. The intercross of the <italic>Rex1 </italic>heterozygotes revealed mild reduction of the homozygous pups between 17.5 dpc and 8 weeks after the birth. Although the reason of this lethality with low penetrance is completely mysterious since the expression of <italic>Rex1 </italic>is only detectable in the germ cells at the late-stage embryos and the pups, <italic>Rex1 </italic>should have some function apart from the pluripotent stem cells, which is out of our scope of the research. We hope the <italic>Rex1 </italic>mutant mice strain we generated will be applied for the further studies to unlock the mystery of the <italic>Rex1 </italic>function in the differentiated cell lineage.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We showed that Rex1 function is dispensable for self-renewal of mouse ES cells.
