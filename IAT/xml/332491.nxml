The promoters were obtained by fusing complementing sequence regions located upstream and downstream from the GCGC discriminator motif of the growth rate regulated rRNA P1 promoter and a non-regulated tac promoter variant. The activities and the regulatory response of the hybrid promoters were determined in vivo using a promoter test vector system with the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene. Measurements were made at different growth rates and after starvation for isoleucine to induce the stringent response. Neither the upstream nor the downstream sequence of P1 relative to the GCGC discriminator motif conferred comparable regulatory features when fused to the complementing sequences of the non-regulated mutant tac promoter. A minor response to amino acid deprivation or changes in the growth rate was noted for the hybrid promoter with the rrnB P1 upstream segment and the tac downstream element, pointing to a slightly different importance of the two sequence elements for regulation. The parallel effects for stringent as well as growth rate regulation of the hybrid promoters supports the view of a common mechanism for both types of control. However, none of the promoter sequence elements on its own was able to restore the complete regulatory behaviour of their 'parent' promoters.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00205-0087.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6271"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00205-0088.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6272"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00205-0089.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6273"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00205-0090.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6274"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00205-0091.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6275"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
