Comparison to the previously reported human sequence revealed extensive identity (approximately 86%) between the two genes from +1 to -580 with additional small islands of homology further upstream. Proximal sites which have been shown to be important in regulation of the human IL2 gene are well conserved in sequence and location. Transfection experiments using hybrid gene constructs containing varying lengths of the mouse 5' flanking DNA linked to a CAT reporter gene have demonstrated the presence of several novel positive and negative regulatory elements. One negative regulatory region lying between -750 and -1000 consists primarily of alternating purines and pyrimidines and is absent from the human gene. The conserved region from -321 and -578, an upstream segment from -1219 to -1332, and another region of approximately 450 bp from -1449 to -1890, which contained a well-conserved sequence of 60 bp, were each associated with enhanced levels of expression. We found no evidence for intragenic or downstream enhancer elements in this gene. All the elements identified affect only the magnitude of the inducible response, for no region when deleted had the effect of altering either the need for induction, the kinetics of stimulation, or the cell-type specificity of expression. Deletion studies suggest a strong requirement for NFAT binding even in the presence of extensive 5' flanking sequence. Therefore we conclude that IL2 gene expression is controlled primarily through a central TH1-specific signaling pathway, which acts through proximal elements, while distal cis-elements exert a secondary modulating effect.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00199-0212-a" xlink:role="4529"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00199-0214-a" xlink:role="4531"/></fig><fig id="F3"><graphic xlink:href="nar00199-0215-a" xlink:role="4532"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00199-0206.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4523"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00199-0207.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4524"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00199-0208.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4525"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00199-0209.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4526"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00199-0210.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4527"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00199-0211.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4528"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00199-0212.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4529"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00199-0213.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4530"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00199-0214.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4531"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00199-0215.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4532"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00199-0216.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="4533"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
