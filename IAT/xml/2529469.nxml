Two weeks after injury CNV was quantified by immunostaining with anti-CD31.

Compared with WT mice, CCL3-KO and CCR5-KO mice but not CCR1-KO mice exhibited reduced CNV two weeks after injury both macroscopically and microscopically as evidenced by CD31 positive areas. Concomitantly, the infiltration of F4/80 positive macrophages but not Gr-1 positive neutrophils was significantly attenuated in CCL3-KO mice compared with WT mice. Intracorneal infiltration of CCR5 expressing cells was significantly impaired in CCL3-KO mice compared with WT mice. Alkali injury induced a massive increase in the intraocular mRNA expression of a potent angiogenic factor, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), in WT mice whereas these increments were severely retarded in CCL3-KO mice. Moreover, CCL3 enhanced VEGF expression by murine peritoneal macrophages at both the mRNA and the protein level. Furthermore, topical CCL3 application restored CNV, which was macroscopically and microscopically reduced in CCL3-KO mice after two weeks to levels similar to those found in WT mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>In alkali-induced CNV, CCL3 induced macrophages to infiltrate and produce VEGF by binding to CCR5 but not to CCR1 and eventually promoted angiogenesis.</p></sec></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>GalleyStatus</meta-name><meta-value>Export to XML</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The cornea is characterized by an absence of blood vessels under physiologic conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>]. Corneal avascularity is maintained by a balance between angiogenic and anti-angiogenic molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r6">6</xref>] and is required for optical clarity and the maintenance of vision. Thus, corneal neovascularization (CNV) can lead to impaired vision when it arises from any cause including corneal infections, misuse of contact lenses, chemical burns, and inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>]. In most of these conditions, a large number of neutrophils infiltrate into the cornea before the onset of CNV followed by an infiltration of monocytes/macrophages. Although neutrophils are presumed to be involved in CNV, we have previously shown that alkali-induced CNV developed independently of granulocyte infiltration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>].</p><p>Leukocyte infiltration is regulated by coordinative actions of adhesion molecules and chemokines with the chemokine receptor expression pattern on leukocytes determining their responsiveness to a given chemokine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>]. Monocytes/macrophages express a distinct set of chemokine receptors including CCR1, CCR2, CCR5, and CX3CR1 on their cell surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>]. We have previously found a potent angiogenic factor, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which was detected in intraocularly infiltrating monocytes/macrophages before CNV development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>]. CNV could be consistently attenuated by genetic ablation of either the <italic>CCR2</italic> or <italic>CCR5</italic> gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>], which also reduced intraocular VEGF production. In contrast, several other groups have provided evidence to indicate that infiltrating macrophages have anti-angiogenic activities in choroidal neovascularization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>]. In line with this notion, we also observed that intraocularly infiltrated CX3CR1-positive macrophages expressed anti-angiogenic molecules such as thrombospondins and were protective against alkali-induced CNV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>]. Thus, the monocyte/macrophage population may be heterogeneous in terms of angiogenic activities, which depends on their chemokine receptor expression pattern.</p><p>We previously observed that CCR1 was expressed in endothelial cells in human hepatoma tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>]. Furthermore, both CCR1-knockout (KO) and CCL3-KO mice exhibited impairment in carcinogen-induced hepatocarcinogenesis with reduced macrophage infiltration and intra-tumor neovascularization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>]. These observations would imply that involvement of the CCL3-CCR1 axis in neovascularization is essential. Because CCL3 can also bind to CCR5 as well as CCR1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>], we compared the molecular pathological changes between WT mice and mice that were deficient in CCL3, CCR1, or CCR5 in a frequently used ocular neovascularization model, alkali-induced CNV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>], to address the roles of CCL3 and its receptors in CNV. We provided definitive evidence to indicate involvement of the CCL3/CCR5 axis but not the CCL3/CCR1 axis in alkali-induced CNV.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Reagents and antibodies</title><p>Recombinant CCL3/MIP-1&#x003b1; (270-LD) and goat anti-mouse CCL3 antibodies were obtained from R&#x00026;D Systems (Minneapolis, MN).

In cooperation with adhesion molecules, chemokines can regulate the trafficking of various types of leukocytes, which in turn regulate two processes of tissue repair, granulation tissue formation, and neovascularization by producing various growth factors and cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref>]. Moreover, several chemokines can directly regulate neovascularization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">33</xref>]. Alkali injury induced a transient macrophage infiltration into eyes with enhanced intraocular CCL3 expression. Several independent groups reported that CCL3 has direct effects on endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r33">33</xref>] and that its receptor, CCR1, was expressed in certain types of endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r20">20</xref>]. However, CCL3 can restore CNV in CCL3-KO mice to similar levels shown in WT mice. This restoration of CNV is seen even if CCL3 was administered only in the early phase after the injury at the time when the endothelial cells are absent. Thus, CCL3 may not directly target endothelial cells in this model.</p><p>The cornea lacks vasculature under normal physiologic conditions. Corneal avascularity is maintained by the balance between angiogenic factors including VEGF and bFGF and anti-angiogenic factors including TSP-1 and soluble VEGF receptor I [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>]. Alkali injury augmented intraocular mRNA expression of <italic>bFGF</italic> and <italic>TSP-1</italic> in CCL3-KO mice to an extent similar to that in WT mice. On the contrary, alkali-induced, enhanced VEGF expression was markedly attenuated in CCL3-KO mice. Because soluble VEGF receptor I, a decoy receptor for VEGF, is constitutively present and acts as a major anti-angiogenic factor in the cornea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>], the reduced VEGF expression in CCL3-KO mice may account for attenuated CNV after alkali injury in these mice. Moreover, CCL3 can augment VEGF production by macrophages. Thus, it is likely that CCL3 induced CNV indirectly by inducing the infiltration and activation of macrophages, a major source of VEGF.</p><p>Macrophages are proposed to play crucial roles in tissue repair based on the observations that these cells can abundantly produce various growth and angiogenic factors. As seen with other types of leukocytes, macrophage infiltration is regulated mainly by coordinated actions of adhesion molecules and chemokines. Chemokines bind to their cognate receptors on leukocytes to exert their actions. Macrophages express a limited set of chemokine receptors including CCR1, CCR2, CCR5, and CX3CR1 and exhibit chemotaxis to their ligands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r14">14</xref>]. CCL3 utilizes two distinct receptors, CCR1 and CCR5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>], with slight differences in their expression patterns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>]. Reduced CNV in CCR5-KO mice prompted us to evaluate the roles of CCL3 and CCR1 in this model. CCL3 deficiency but not CCR1 deficiency reduced alkali-induced CNV. We recently observed that bleomycin-induced intrapulmonary macrophage accumulation and subsequent pulmonary fibrosis was attenuated in CCL3-KO and CCR5-KO mice but not in CCR1 KO mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r34">34</xref>]. This suggests that CCR5 expressing cells are distinct from CCR1 expressing cells. Indeed, a double-color immunofluorescence analysis demonstrated that CCR5 expressing cells did not express CCR1 simultaneously (unpublished data). Thus, CCL3 may generally regulate macrophage functions by binding CCR5 expressed on their surface but not CCR1.</p><p>A partial reduction of macrophage infiltration by CCL3 deficiency suggests a contribution of other chemokines such as CCL2 and CX3CL1 to macrophage infiltration. This may further indicate heterogeneity of monocytes/macrophages in terms of chemokine receptor expression patterns as previously suggested by Geissmann and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r35">35</xref>] who proposed the presence of two blood monocytes consisting of inflammatory CX3CR1<sup>low</sup>CCR2<sup>+</sup> and resting CX3CR1<sup>high</sup>CCR2<sup>-</sup> populations. Macrophages are presumed to exert pro-angiogenic actions under various situations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>], but Apte and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r17">17</xref>] demonstrated anti-angiogenic activities of macrophages in CNV. These observations suggest a functional heterogeneity among macrophages during the angiogenetic process. Indeed, we demonstrated that CX3CR1 positive macrophages could dampen alkali-induced CNV by producing anti-angiogenic molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>], which is in contrast to the observations on CCR2-deficient mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>]. We previously revealed that the CCL2/CCR2 interactions were involved in VEGF production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>] and observed that CCR5 expressing cells simultaneously expressed CCR2. Thus, CCR5 deletion reduced the number of CCR2 expressing macrophages, the cells that can express VEGF, and as a result, this reduction eventually prevented alkali-induced CNV.</p><p>Several independent groups have reported the presence of resident macrophages, dendritic cells, langerhans cells, and T cells in normal corneas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r36">36</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r39">39</xref>]. The number of resident macrophages in the normal corneal stroma is around 100 per mm<sup>2</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r36">36</xref>], and in the current experimental conditions, we detected few, if any, F4/80 positive or CD68 positive macrophages in the normal corneas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r18">18</xref>]. Thus, it is not likely that corneal resident macrophages contribute directly to CNV.</p><p>However, the simple dichotomy of monocytes/macrophages proposed by Geissmann was complicated by the observation that CCR2<sup>-</sup> and CCR2<sup>+</sup> monocytes depended on CCR5 and CX3CR1, respectively, when they entered into atherosclerotic plaques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r40">40</xref>]. Ambati and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r15">15</xref>] reported that CCR2 deficiency inhibited CNV, but they did not examine the roles of macrophages in this process. Thus, the effects of the CCR2 axis on macrophage infiltration in CNV or the interaction between the CCR2 and CCR5 axis remain unclear. More detailed analysis on this point will clarify the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying macrophage infiltration and subsequent CNV development.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This work was supported by the International Cooperative Program of Kanazawa University (N.M.), National Natural Science Foundation in China (NSFC No 30572120, NSFC No 30771978), Jiangsu Natural Science Foundation (BK2006528), China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (2005038587), grants from Soochow University (No90134602; P.L.), and National Natural Science Key Program Foundation in China (NSFC No 30330540; X.Z.).
