At present, the role(s) of scapinin in the brain and tumors are poorly understood. We show that the RPEL-repeat domain of scapinin, which is responsible for its direct interaction with actin, inhibits actin polymerization <italic>in vitro</italic>. Next, we established a Hela cell line, where scapinin expression was induced by tetracycline. In these cells, expression of scapinin stimulated cell spreading and motility. Scapinin was colocalized with actin at the edge of spreading cells. To explore the roles of the RPEL-repeat and PP1-binding domains, we expressed wild-type and mutant scapinins as fusion proteins with green fluorescence protein (GFP) in Cos7 cells. Expression of GFP-scapinin (wild type) also stimulated cell spreading, but mutation in the RPEL-repeat domain abolished both the actin binding and the cell spreading activity. PP1-binding deficient mutants strongly induced cell retraction. Long and branched cytoplasmic processes were developed during the cell retraction. These results suggest that scapinin enhances cell spreading and motility through direct interaction with actin and that PP1 plays a regulatory role in scapinin-induced morphological changes.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The actin cytoskeleton is a vital component of a wide variety of cellular and developmental processes such as cell adhesion, cell migration, cell-cell interaction, and signal transduction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004247-Raftopoulou1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004247-Posern1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.

Scapinin was down-regulated in HL-60 cells during differentiation induced by all-trans retinoic acid, an anti-tumor drug. EST clone analysis revealed the presence of scapinin gene transcripts in some cancer cells, for example lung and kidney carcinomas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004247-Sagara1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. However, in normal adult tissues, scapinin is selectively expressed in the brain. At present, the role(s) of scapinin in the brain and tumors are unknown.</p><p>Scapinin is a member of phactr/scapinin family, in which the PP1-binding domain and the RPEL-repeat domain are highly conserved. This family includes four members, phactr1, phactr2, scapinin/phactr3, and phactr4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004247-Allen1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. PP1 is a major eukaryotic serine/threonine protein phosphatase that regulates diverse cellular processes such as muscle contraction, glycogen metabolism, neuronal signaling, and actin cytoskeleton organization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004247-Fernandez1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004247-Ceulemans1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. The catalytic subunit of PP1 binds to regulatory subunits that are critical for substrate specificity and spatial control of PP1 within the cell. Allen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004247-Allen1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref> demonstrated that the RPEL-repeat domain of phactr1 is responsible for actin binding. However, it remains unclear whether the RPEL-repeat domain interacts with actin directly or indirectly.</p><p>The RPEL-repeat domain is composed of tandem repeats of three RPEL motifs (pfam PF02755) and was initially identified as an actin binding domain in megakaryocytic acute leukemia protein (MAL) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004247-Miralles1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. MAL is a transcriptional coactivator for serum response factor (SRF), a transcription factor that activates the mitogen-responsive genes. The dynamics of actin (assembly and disassembly) control SRF activity by regulating the subcellular localization of MAL (cytoplasm or nucleus) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004247-Miralles1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004247-Vartiainen1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. The RPEL-repeat domain of MAL interacts with monomeric actin only. It also works as a sensor for the actin monomer pool. The actin monomer pool is controlled by extracellular growth stimuli such as serum, through Rho family GTPase. Serum-activated Rho GTPase shifts the equilibrium of actin dynamics from the monomeric form to the filamentous form, and consequently MAL loses actin monomers and accumulates in the nucleus.</p><p>To explore the function(s) of scapinin, we expressed scapinin in cells and monitored their morphological changes. Scapinin expression stimulated cell spreading and motility. Furthermore, mutation experiments showed that both the RPEL-repeat domain and the PP1-binding domain play crucial roles in these morphological changes. Scapinin was colocalized with actin at the edge of spreading cells. The RPEL-repeat domain of scapinin directly interacts with actin and inhibits actin polymerization <italic>in vitro</italic>.

Notably, actin stress fibers were seen in cells expressing lower levels of scapinin, but their number was decreased in cells expressing higher levels of scapinin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004247-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). In addition, scapinin-staining was hardly seen in actin stress fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004247-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). It seems that scapinin expression reduces the number of actin stress fibers and increases the amount of peripheral actin. Mutations in the RPEL-repeat domain abolished both the actin-binding and morphology-changing activities of scapinin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004247-g007">Fig. 7</xref>). These results demonstrate that scapinin can modulate actin cytoskeleton structures and thereby enhance cell spreading and motility.</p><p>The RPEL-repeat domain of scapinin interacts with purified skeletal muscle actin without any accessory proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004247-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>). Mutations in the RPEL-repeat domain abolished both the actin-binding and morphology-changing activities of scapinin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004247-g001">Fig. 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004247-g007">7</xref>). These results clearly demonstrate that direct interactions with actin through the RPEL-repeat domain are essential for scapinin-induced morphological changes.</p><p>It is known that the RPEL-repeat domain of MAL interacts with actin monomers, but not with actin filaments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004247-Miralles1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. The GST-RPEL construct of MAL inhibits actin polymerization <italic>in vitro</italic>, supporting the fact that the RPEL-repeated sequence is an actin-monomer-binding motif <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004247-Posern2">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. The consensus amino acid sequence of RPEL motifs , RPxxxEL, is conserved in the scapinin-RPEL-repeat domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004247-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). Our <italic>in vitro</italic> study demonstrated that the GST-RPEL construct of scapinin inhibits actin polymerization like that of MAL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004247-g002">Fig. 2B and C</xref>). This result suggests that the RPEL-repeat domain of scapinin like MAL may interact with actin monomers, but not with actin filaments. Further studies are required to determine the exact mode of actin-scapinin interactions.</p><p>Various kinds of actin-monomer-binding proteins play regulatory roles in actin dynamics, i.e., disassembly and assembly, and thereby govern cell adhesion, cell motility, and cell morphology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004247-Paavilainen1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. For example, although profilin and ADF/cofilin were initially identified as an actin-monomer-sequestering protein and an actin-depolymerizing factor respectively, it is now established that they play central roles in directional actin-filament growth, or &#x02018;treadmilling&#x02019; as it is also known <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004247-Pollard1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004247-Takenawa1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Wiskott-Aldridge syndrome protein (WASP) homology domain 2 (WH2) is a small and widespread actin-monomer-binding motif. WH2 has versatile regulatory functions in actin dynamics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004247-Paunola1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004247-Hertzog1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. Among WH2 containing proteins, whereas &#x003b2;-thymosins sequester actin monomers during polymerization, WASP family proteins (WASP, N-WASP, and WAVE) activate Arp2/3-dependent actin nucleation and branching in respond to signals mediated by Rho-family GTPase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004247-Ridly1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004247-Hall1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. WASP and N-WASP interact with Arp2/3 complex through the C-terminal acidic region. Further biochemical and structural studies are required to determine the exact mode of actin-scapinin interaction by which scapinin enhances cell spreading and motility. However, we do not exclude the possibility that scapinin partly modulates cell morphology at the transcriptional level, increasing or decreasing particular proteins to regulate actin dynamics.</p><p>In contrast to scapinin, MAL induces no cell morphological changes after the transfection of expression plasmids into cells (personal communication, Dr. Treisman R.). Favot et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004247-Favot1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref> reported that, when phactr/scapinn family proteins (they named them PPEL proteins) were expressed as GFP fusion proteins in cells, all four family members modified the shape of cells so that a rough appearance at the edges of cells and various lengths of hair-like cytoplasmic extensions were observed. In addition, they also reported that all four members were predominantly distributed in the cytoplasm. Their results are in good agreement with ours and indicate that the cell morphology changing activity is a common feature of all four members of the phactr/scapinin family.</p><p>This study suggests that scapinin can enhance cell spreading and motility through interactions with actin cytoskeletons. EST clone analysis demonstrated the presence of scapinin gene transcripts in some tumors cells such as lung and kidney carcinomas. Cell migration is a critical step in tumor invasion and metastasis, and regulation of this process will lead to therapies for treating cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004247-Yamazaki1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Further studies on the expression profile of scapinin in various types of tumor cells and the relationship of scapinin expression levels with malignancy are necessary.</p><p>PP1 is a major eukaryotic serine/threonine protein phosphatase that regulates diverse cellular processes such as muscle contraction, glycogen metabolism, neuronal signaling, and actin cytoskeleton organization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004247-Fernandez1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004247-Ceulemans1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. The catalytic subunit of PP1 binds to regulatory subunits that are critical for substrate specificity and spatial control of PP1 within the cell. PP1-binding deficient mutants (&#x00394;469&#x02013;518 and F515A) induced cell rounding with extensive development of long cytoplasmic processes instead of cell spreading (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004247-g007">Fig. 7</xref>). This result demonstrates that PP1 plays a regulatory role in scapinin-induced morphological changes.</p><p>It was reported that the <italic>humpty dumpty</italic> mouse mutant phenotype with failure to close the neural tube and optic fissure is caused by a missense mutation in phacrt4 (a member of the phactr/scapinin family), and interestingly, the missense mutation specifically disrupts binding to PP1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004247-Kim1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. This demonstrates that the PP1-binding activity of phactr4 is critical for its physiological role in embryogenesis. Our data also demonstrate that the PP1-binding activity of scapinin is critical for the biological activity of scapinin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004247-g007">Fig. 7</xref>).</p><p>The <italic>humpty</italic> embryos display elevated proliferation and abnormally phosphorylated, inactive PP1, resulting in RB hyperphosphorylation and derepression of E2F targets. We initially identified scapinin as a component of the nuclear nonchromatin structures (nuclear matrix or nucleoskeleton) in HL-60 cells and found that scapinin is down-regulated during differentiation induced by all-trans retinoic acid treatment (an anti-tumor drug). Recently numerous studies have established the presence of actin in the nucleus and have shown that actin is involved diversely in nuclear activities including gene transcription, chromatin remodeling, and nucleocytoplasmic trafficking <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004247-Hofmann1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004247-Dundr1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004247-Vartiainen1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition to actin, actin binding and adhesion proteins are present in the nucleus and modulate nuclear functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004247-Yoo1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. We currently hypothesize dual roles for scapinin in the cytoplasm and nucleus.</p><p>The <italic>scapinin/phactr3</italic> gene has four leader exons, implying that regulation of its gene expression may be complicated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004247-Worch1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. Down-regulation of gene expression by RNAi is a powerful tool for studying the physiological roles of many genes. Our attempts to explore the functions of scapinin with RNAi have not yet succeeded. The presence of multiple leader exons in the <italic>scapinin/phactr3</italic> gene may make it difficult. Further genetic studies are necessary to determine the roles of scapinin in cell proliferation and morphogenesis of normal neuronal tissues.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Drs Mie Moriya and
