This proofreading step is accomplished in eukaryotes by the TFIIH complex. The critical damage recognition component of TFIIH is the XPD protein, a DNA helicase that unwinds DNA and identifies the damage. Here, we describe the crystal structure of an archaeal XPD protein with high sequence identity to the human XPD protein that reveals how the structural helicase framework is combined with additional elements for strand separation and DNA scanning. Two RecA-like helicase domains are complemented by a 4Fe4S cluster domain, which has been implicated in damage recognition, and an &#x003b1;-helical domain. The first helicase domain together with the helical and 4Fe4S-cluster&#x02013;containing domains form a central hole with a diameter sufficient in size to allow passage of a single stranded DNA. Based on our results, we suggest a model of how DNA is bound to the XPD protein, and can rationalize several of the mutations in the human <italic>XPD</italic> gene that lead to one of three severe diseases, xeroderma pigmentosum, Cockayne syndrome, and trichothiodystrophy.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>Preserving the structural integrity of DNA, and hence the genetic information stored in this molecule, is essential for cellular survival. It is estimated that the DNA in each human cell acquires about 10<sup>4</sup> lesions per day. Consequently, efficient DNA repair mechanisms have evolved to protect the genome. One of these DNA repair mechanisms, nucleotide excision repair (NER), is present in all organisms and is unique in its ability to repair a broad range of damage. In humans, NER is the major repair mechanism protecting DNA from damage induced by ultraviolet light. Defects in the genes and proteins responsible for NER can lead to one of three severe diseases: xeroderma pigmentosum, Cockayne syndrome, and trichothiodystrophy. The XPD protein is one of the key components of a ten-protein complex and is essential to initiate NER. In particular, the XPD protein verifies the presence of damage to the DNA and thereby allows DNA repair to proceed. We have solved the 3-dimensional structure of the XPD protein, and show how XPD has assembled several domains to form a donut-shaped molecule, which is able to separate two DNA strands and scan the DNA for damage. The structure also helps to explain why some of the mutations that have been identified in humans are associated with disease.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>The structure of the DNA repair protein XPD provides insights into how the protein binds and recognizes damaged DNA and how mutations in<italic>XPD</italic> disrupt its function and lead to disease.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Wolski SC, Kuper J, H&#x000e4;nzelmann P, Truglio JJ, Croteau DL, et al.

NER is the only repair mechanism in humans that is able to remove photoproducts induced by ultraviolet light. The phenotypic consequences of defective genes involved in NER are apparent in three severe diseases: xeroderma pigmentosum, Cockayne syndrome, and trichothiodystrophy &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060149-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060149-b007">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060149-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;. The mechanism of the human NER system, while analogous to the well-characterized bacterial system, is less well understood. Over 30 proteins have been identified in humans that are critical for mediating the individual steps leading from damage recognition to incision and repair. However, due to the paucity of specific structural intermediates, the precise role for each protein has not been fully delineated.</p><p>NER has been proposed to proceed through either a &#x0201c;bipartite substrate discrimination&#x0201d; or a &#x0201c;multi-partite damage recognition&#x0201d; model &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060149-b011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060149-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;. It is generally believed that NER is initiated by the combined action of XPC and RAD23B, which recognize a general disruption of Watson-Crick base-pairing created in the vicinity of the damaged nucleotide. Both proteins are required to recruit the ten-subunit transcription factor TFIIH to this site. The XPD and XPB proteins are two helicases that are present in TFIIH, and which open the DNA around the lesion in an ATP-dependent fashion. This is the first catalytic step in this reaction pathway, leading to a conformational change that allows the recruitment of additional NER factors &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060149-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060149-b013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060149-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d;. A second, more important function of the two helicases is damage verification. Recent data suggest very different roles for XPB and XPD &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060149-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;. The helicase activity of the XPB protein seems to be dispensable; however, its ATPase activity is essential for NER. This has been interpreted to suggest a wrapping of the DNA around XPB, which leads to an opening of the double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) close to the lesion. This opening allows the correct binding of XPD, which then utilizes its helicase activity to verify the damage and ensures that the backbone distortion is not the result of an unusual DNA sequence. This process was termed &#x0201c;enzymatic proofreading&#x0201d; and supports the bipartite damage recognition model in which the function of XPC-RAD23B is limited to the observation of a backbone distortion, and XPD is required to verify the damage through its helicase activity &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060149-b016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060149-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Very recently, it has been shown that the XPD protein contains an FeS cluster, which is essential for its function &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060149-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;.

Two additional domains emerge from the first helicase domain and form a hole that is sufficient to allow passage of ssDNA. Furthermore, the structure delineates how different mutations in the protein lead to the human genetic disorders xeroderma pigmentosum, Cockayne syndrome, and trichothiodystrophy.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results/Discussion</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Overall Structure of XPD</title><p>Two different XPD-related protein sequences from <named-content content-type="genus-species">T. acidophilum</named-content> have been deposited in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) and the Swiss-Prot databases, respectively.

The remainder of domain 4 is positioned in front of the ring without obstructing the hole of the donut. The overall dimensions of the protein can therefore be divided into the donut with a width and height of 65 &#x000c5; and 75 &#x000c5; and a thickness of 29 &#x000c5;.

The interface between domains 1 and 4 forms the composite ATP binding site. Domain 1 contains helicase motifs I, Ia, II, and III, whereas domain 4 harbors helicase motifs IV, V, and VI &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060149-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060149-g002">Figure 2</xref>).

XPD and UvrB can be superimposed with an rms deviation of 2.6 &#x000c5; using 254 aligned C&#x003b1; atoms out of 588 and 505 residues, respectively. The match is mostly mediated via the two helicase domains, whereas the other domains have no significant structural similarity to each other (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060149-sg002">Figure S2</xref>). In addition, we compared XPD to Hel308 and NS3, two SF2 helicases (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060149-sg003">Figure S3</xref>). The superposition shows that structural similarities are again mainly confined to the RecA domains, whereas the auxiliary domains are highly variable. Hel308 and NS3 have been structurally characterized with DNA substrates, and both represent a closed state of the helicase framework &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060149-b025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060149-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d;. No adenosine nucleotide is bound in these structures, but they are presumed to be in a preprocessive state that only requires ATP binding to reach the processive state &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060149-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d;. Using the first RecA domain (domain 1) as a reference point for superposition with either Hel308 or NS3, XPD assumes a more open state that is mainly mediated via a rotation of the second RecA domain (domain 4) of about 30&#x000b0; or 16&#x000b0;, respectively, relative to domain 1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060149-sg003">Figure S3</xref>C). The composite ATP binding site is located near the hinge region when compared to the closed state of the other two helicases. Our structure may therefore reflect a ground state of XPD prior to nucleotide and/or DNA binding that underlines the conformational flexibility necessary to translate chemical energy into motion.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>The FeS Cluster Domain</title><p>The first insertion into helicase domain 1 is of particular interest since it contains an FeS cluster, a unique feature among the XPD-like SF2 helicases &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060149-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;. Domain 2 displays an exclusively &#x003b1;-helical architecture consisting of six &#x003b1;-helices and one 3<sub>10</sub> helix that surround the central 4Fe4S cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060149-g001">Figure 1</xref>A, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060149-g001">1</xref>C, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060149-g001">1</xref>D). The FeS cluster is coordinated by four cysteines, consistent with the coordination typically observed in 4Fe4S clusters, and all four cysteines display continuous connectivity in the electron density maps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060149-g001">Figure 1</xref>C). A comparison of the B-factors between the 4Fe4S cluster and the surrounding protein residues reveals similar values, indicating full occupancy of the cluster. Three of the coordinating cysteines (Cys92, Cys128, and Cys164) are located in loops, whereas the fourth cysteine, Cys113, is located in a central position within &#x003b1;-helix 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060149-g001">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060149-g002">2</xref>). Surprisingly, it was shown that the helicase activity is not affected when Cys102 or Cys105 in <named-content content-type="genus-species">Sulfolobus acidocaldarius</named-content> or <named-content content-type="genus-species">Ferroplasma acidarmanus</named-content> XPD, respectively, were mutated to serine &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060149-b018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060149-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;.

When any of the remaining cysteines is mutated to serine, however, the helicase activity of the enzyme is abrogated &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060149-b018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060149-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>The cluster is further stabilized predominantly by hydrophobic interactions. Residues Arg88 and Tyr166, which shield the cluster from solvent exposure, are strictly conserved and face towards a pronounced solvent-exposed groove that is formed by &#x003b1;-helices 5 and 8 from domain 2 and &#x003b1;-helix 10 from domain 1 at the back of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060149-g001">Figures 1</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060149-g003">3</xref>).

This hypothesis is further supported by site-directed mutagenesis studies that demonstrate that single mutations of three of the four 4Fe4S cluster coordinating cysteines to serine lead to a loss of the 4Fe4S cluster, and abrogate helicase activity, but retain a correctly folded protein that is still able to translate along ssDNA &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060149-b018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060149-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>DNA Binding and Unwinding</title><p>The XPD protein is a member of the SF2 helicases.

The surface potential indicates a positively charged path for dsDNA along domain 4, leading towards a highly conserved groove along domain 4 and domain 1, which provides sufficient space for ssDNA and directs the DNA towards the hole formed by domains 1&#x02013;3. The dsDNA requires separation into ssDNA prior to entering the groove. Recently, the structure of the SF2 helicase Hel308 was determined in complex with DNA, and a prominent &#x003b2;-hairpin in the second helicase domain was identified that is responsible for initial strand separation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060149-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d;. It was proposed that this &#x003b2;-hairpin could be a general feature of SF2 helicases.

The last two turns of &#x003b1;22 and the first two helical turns of &#x003b1;23 contain several aromatic amino acids, which could stabilize the separated DNA strands in a fashion similar to that observed for Hel308. On one side of this wedge, the highly conserved residues Tyr540 and Tyr545 are oriented with their side chains pointing towards the solvent where they could easily form stacking interactions with the exposed bases of ssDNA. These stacking interactions can then be continued by additional solvent-exposed aromatic residues, such as Tyr23, leading the ssDNA along the back of the protein to a position where the two strands meet again to reform dsDNA. Although exposed aromatic residues are also present on the other side of the wedge, their degree of conservation is relatively low. In our structure, Phe538 and Tyr425 could both stack against the bases in ssDNA. However, only Tyr425 is conserved, whereas Phe538 is replaced by a leucine in eukaryotic XPDs. This substitution appears to be compensated by the occurrence of Phe651 in human XPD, which substitutes for Ser552 in <named-content content-type="genus-species">T. acidophilum</named-content> XPD; and due to the close spatial proximity of the two side chains, they would assume similar positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060149-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Consequently, there is one phenylalanine available that would represent the required stacking partner.

Since the distance between phosphates in ssDNA is approximately 6.4 &#x000c5;, it is therefore very tempting to speculate that some DNA remains bound to the protein during purification and gives rise to these residual electron density features.

The dimensions and shape of this pocket are ideally suited to accommodate a nonmodified purine or pyrimidine base, which would be held in place through van der Waals interactions with the residues mentioned above. Due to its location, this surface feature would allow a direct coupling between the FeS cluster and a readout of the DNA.

In the absence of an XPD-DNA complex containing a lesion, the process of proofreading remains highly speculative.

The dimension of this hole, with a diameter of 13 &#x000c5;, however, is most likely too big to provide a trap for damaged DNA. One possible candidate for the &#x0201c;analysis&#x0201d; of each base with respect to their correct structure would be the narrow pocket in the wall of the central hole described above. The size of this pocket suggests that only nondamaged bases could be accommodated, whereas a bulky DNA substrate would be excluded. This pocket is also an attractive candidate for the damage recognition process due to its close proximity to the 4Fe4S cluster and the involvement of Arg112 of human XPD (Arg88 in our structure), which has been shown to cause trichothiodystrophy when mutated to histidine.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Mutations Leading to Xeroderma Pigmentosum, Cockayne Syndrome, or Trichothiodystrophy</title><p>TFIIH in humans is not only required for DNA repair, but is also essential for transcription &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060149-b042">42</xref>&#x0005d;.

The proposed role for Arg88 in analogy to MutY as described above may be accomplished by Arg112 in the human XPD protein and a mutation to histidine, as observed in trichothiodystrophy patients, could prevent this interaction, thus reducing the affinity of the protein to the DNA. However, the exact role of the 4Fe4S cluster, whether it is involved directly in the recognition process or the translocation along the DNA, remains speculative at this point.

Gly576 is positioned in this &#x003b2;-strand and points towards two hydrophobic residues, Leu568 and Ile569 (Ala667 and Ile668 in human XPD) in &#x003b1;24. A mutation of Gly675 to an arginine would push the entire helix away from the &#x003b2;-strand and thereby destabilize the integrity of the domain. Asp582 is located directly behind &#x003b2;16 and forms tight interactions with the strictly conserved Arg584 (Arg683 in human XPD), and the latter forms additional interactions with Asp426 and Phe527 (Glu509 and Tyr625 in human XPD), two highly conserved residues. The point mutations at the C-terminal end of XPD thus clearly play important structural roles, and any of the four mutations would interfere with the fold of domain 4, which could also diminish the interactions with p44. According to our protein&#x02013;DNA model, however, <named-content content-type="genus-species">T. acidophilum</named-content> Arg584 (Arg683 in human XPD) also plays an important role in DNA binding and is one of the residues that may bind to the DNA close to the double-strand/single-strand junction. Replacing this positively charged residue with either a glutamine or tryptophan may severely interfere with DNA binding and thereby lead to the disease phenotype.</p><p>The crystal structure of XPD from <named-content content-type="genus-species">T. acidophilum</named-content> revealed that the protein contains two RecA-like helicase domains and two additional domains that emerge from the first helicase domain. Surprisingly, the first three domains form a donut-shaped structure and a protein&#x02013;DNA model is proposed in which one of the ssDNA strands passes through this central hole in close spatial proximity to the 4Fe4S cluster in the second domain. The high sequence homology to eukaryotic XPDs allowed the analysis of mutations leading to one of the three severe diseases xeroderma pigmentosum, Cockayne syndrome, or trichothiodystrophy and provides the basis for a more detailed analysis to understand the combined action of the helicase and the 4Fe4S cluster to achieve damage verification within the NER repair cascade.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s3"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Protein expression and purification.</title><p>The genes encoding two XPDs from <named-content content-type="genus-species">T. acidophilum</named-content> with variable N-termini (residues 1&#x02013;622 and 23&#x02013;622) were cloned into the pET16b vector (Novagen) using the NdeI and XhoI restriction sites.
