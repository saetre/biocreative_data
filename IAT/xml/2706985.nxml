Consequently, mutations of the mitochondrial genome cause severe diseases in man and generate traits widely used in plant breeding. Pathogenic mutations can often be identified but direct genetic rescue remains impossible because mitochondrial transformation is still to be achieved in higher eukaryotes. Along this line, it has been shown that isolated plant and mammalian mitochondria are naturally competent for importing linear DNA. However, it has proven difficult to understand how such large polyanions cross the mitochondrial membranes. The genetic tractability of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisae</italic> could be a powerful tool to unravel this molecular mechanism. Here we show that isolated <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> mitochondria can import linear DNA in a process sharing similar characteristics to plant and mammalian mitochondria. Based on biochemical data, translocation through the outer membrane is believed to be mediated by voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) isoforms in higher eukaryotes. Both confirming this hypothesis and validating the yeast model, we illustrate that mitochondria from <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strains deleted for the VDAC-1 or VDAC-2 gene are severely compromised in DNA import. The prospect is now open to screen further mutant yeast strains to identify the elusive inner membrane DNA transporter.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Mitochondrion</kwd><kwd>DNA import competence</kwd><kwd>Membrane transport</kwd><kwd>Yeast mutant</kwd><kwd>VDAC</kwd><kwd>Mitochondrial transfection</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p>On the basis of comparative genomics, mitochondria, organelles common to most eukaryotic species, are believed to have evolved from a metabolically-driven symbiotic event (see <xref rid="bib1 bib2" ref-type="bibr">[1,2]</xref>). Several theories have been proposed <xref rid="bib3 bib4" ref-type="bibr">[3,4]</xref>, but perhaps the most widely accepted is that as the oxygen levels increased in the environment an anaerobic host engulfed an aerobic &#x003b1;-proteobacterium to relieve oxygen tension <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. This endosymbiotic relationship was then cemented by the reductive loss of large parts of the endosymbiont genome. As has been well documented in the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, DNA can be shown to move from the mitochondrion to the nucleus <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, but is it possible for DNA to be taken into the mitochondrion? This question is of great relevance to the human organelle, as there is currently no system for transfecting human mitochondria as a means of rescuing mutations of the mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. Mutations of this genome are known to underlie a series of rare, mainly muscle and neurological diseases but have been implicated in more common neurodegenerative disorders and the ageing process itself <xref rid="bib7 bib8 bib9" ref-type="bibr">[7&#x02013;9]</xref>. It is also of importance in plant genetics, where mitochondrial genetic information influences several traits of agronomical importance, including male sterility, plant vigor, chloroplast function and cross-compatibility <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Consequently, the ability to import DNA into mitochondria may have important therapeutic and economic potential.</p><p>It is well established that bacteria are able to laterally transfer DNA between species by a variety of methods <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, with some species of proteobacteria being able to import DNA directly from the environment (natural competence) <xref rid="bib12 bib13" ref-type="bibr">[12,13]</xref>. DNA can be transported across membranes through the conjugation transport system or through the SpoIIIE/FtsK family of DNA transporters that facilitate chromosome segregation during bacterial division <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. These are complex systems, but we are currently trying to determine whether mitochondria may have retained a cryptic or simplistic form of DNA transporter. Bioinformatic analysis has identified no candidate orthologues for any bacterial gene product implicated in DNA import. However, many plant mitochondrial genomes appear to be evolutionary mosaics of DNA sequences from various sources (nuclear, viral, chloroplastic and unknown) <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, suggesting the retention of DNA import competence, at least in these species. Consistent with this observation, Koulintchenko et al. <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> reported that linearised DNA was able to be taken up into isolated mitochondria from <italic>Solanum tuberosum</italic> and <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> and the imported DNA acted as a template for DNA and RNA synthesis. This competence has been exploited to show that mitochondria from both species contain the enzymes necessary to repair DNA (Boesch et al., submitted for publication). Surprisingly, although mammalian mtDNA is remarkably compact and shows little evidence of mosaicism, isolated rat and human mitochondria can also import linearised DNA, with the imported template being transcribed in a promoter-dependent manner, and the primary transcript being processed and matured <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>.</p><p>What are the transporters and what is the exact molecular mechanism of mitochondrial competence? Original experiments with isolated plant and mammalian mitochondria pointed to a potential role of the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) in DNA transport through the outer membrane <xref rid="bib16 bib17" ref-type="bibr">[16,17]</xref>, but no factors have been identified to date that mediate DNA transfer through the inner membrane, although candidates have been found. It is clear that to progress our knowledge of this process it is necessary to model mitochondrial competence in a system that is genetically tractable. Therefore, we have initiated studies on mitochondria isolated from the yeast, <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. Many strains are available that carry deletions in mitochondrial carrier proteins which could potentially play a role in DNA import. Further, by identifying candidate transporters through a biochemical approach, we expect to be able to delete components of the natural competence system, therefore confirming their role in this process. In the present paper, we report that mitochondria from <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> can indeed import DNA in a facile manner. To show the potential of the genetic approach, we confirm the central role of VDAC in the import process by demonstrating that deletions of VDAC isoforms restrict import. Finally, we report the proteomic analysis of a complex that is bound by DNA, leading to the identification of candidate gene products which may be involved in import.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1"><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><label>2.1</label><title>Yeast strains</title><p>Four yeast (<italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>) strains were used: the parental <italic>POR1</italic>&#x02013;<italic>POR2</italic> strain M3 (<italic>MAT</italic>a <italic>lys2 his4 trp1 ade2 leu2 ura3</italic>), the strain M22-2 (<italic>&#x00394;por1</italic>) containing a deletion of most of the <italic>POR1</italic> gene <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, the strain M3-2 (<italic>&#x00394;por2</italic>) containing a deletion of the <italic>POR2</italic> coding region <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref> and the strain M22-2-1 (<italic>&#x00394;por1</italic>&#x02013;<italic>&#x00394;por2</italic>) double mutant <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>.</p></sec><sec><label>2.2</label><title>Isolation of mitochondria</title><p>Yeast cells were grown at 28&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C in YPGal medium (1%&#x000a0;w/v yeast extract, 2%&#x000a0;w/v peptone, 2%&#x000a0;w/v galactose, pH 5.5) and yeast mitochondria were isolated essentially according to Daum et al. <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>.

Following co-incubation, mitochondrial incorporation was characterised by acquired resistance to extensive DNase-I digestion. Various experimental conditions were tested and DNA uptake into yeast mitochondria was obtained in a minimal medium containing an osmoticum and a buffer, as assessed by the recovery of DNase-resistant full length import substrate in the final organelle fraction. Dependence of the uptake on the size or sequence of the DNA was not observed with the two substrates tested, which was consistent with the data from previous import experiments using various DNA substrates with plant and mammalian mitochondria <xref rid="bib16 bib17" ref-type="bibr">[16,17]</xref>. Higher levels of incorporation were obtained in a Tris&#x02013;HCl/mannitol medium (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>A, lanes 1 to 3). The process was dependent on the pH, with an optimal efficiency around pH 7.2 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>A, lanes 2, 5, 8). According to time course analyses, DNA incorporation into the mitochondrial fraction was progressive and reached a plateau after about 40&#x000a0;min (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>B, lanes 10 to 13). Analysis of the temperature dependence identified an optimum at 30&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>B, lanes 14 to 16). Whereas respiratory substrates were not necessary for import, a significant increase was detected in the presence of glutamate and malate (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>C, lanes 17 and 18). The overall efficiency was in the range of 0.05 to 0.10&#x000a0;fmol of DNA incorporated into 100&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g of mitochondrial protein, comparable to previously estimated values for plant and mammalian mitochondria <xref rid="bib16 bib17" ref-type="bibr">[16,17]</xref>.

To preclude this possibility, after import, mitochondria were subjected to an osmotic shock to disrupt the outer membrane before DNase treatment. Under the conditions used, about 95% of the intermembrane space marker adenylate kinase was lost (data not shown), implying efficient mitoplasting, whereas recovery of the matrix marker citrate synthase was close to 100%, showing that mitoplasts were not disrupted. Such a treatment had no significant influence on the DNase resistance of the incorporated DNA, as compared to a mock-treatment (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>C, lanes 19 and 20), implying that the DNA was protected by the mitochondrial inner membrane and thus had crossed both mitochondrial membranes.</p><p>These results are consistent with isolated yeast mitochondria retaining a natural mechanism for DNA import similar to that of isolated plant and mammalian mitochondria.

In further assays with the 2.3&#x000a0;kb maize plasmid, DIDS at a concentration of 200&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M also inhibited DNA incorporation into plant (cauliflower) organelles (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>A, lanes 2 and 3).</p><p>The polyanion heparin is another anion channel inhibitor, which can interact with the VDAC. Heparin added to the reaction medium at 125&#x000a0;ng/mL indeed abolished DNA import into cauliflower mitochondria (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>A, lanes 4 and 5). Interestingly, when the organelles were preincubated with heparin and washed, subsequent import of DNA was also fully inhibited (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>A, lanes 6 and 7), suggesting that heparin saturated binding sites on the VDAC or possibly on another upstream interacting protein on the outer membrane. The same effect was obtained with rat liver mitochondria (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>B, lanes 8 and 9).</p><p>DNA uptake into yeast mitochondria showed a similar behavior in the presence of the above effectors. DIDS at 200&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M or heparin at 100&#x000a0;ng/mL completely inhibited the process. Both the signal corresponding to the imported full length substrate and the signal representative for the pool of small DNAse-I-generated fragments usually associated with the mitochondrial fraction at the end of the assay disappeared (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, lanes 1 to 3 and 4 to 6). Also Ruthenium Red abolished DNA import into <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> mitochondria in the same concentration range as in the case of plant organelles (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>, lanes 7 to 9). Biochemical data with the yeast system thus further point to DNA translocation through the outer membrane being mediated by the VDAC.</p></sec><sec><label>3.3</label><title>Mutation of individual VDAC genes impairs mitochondrial competence</title><p>The observations altogether indicated that yeast mitochondria are competent for DNA import in the same way as plant and mammalian organelles. Exploiting yeast genetic tools thus appeared to be a relevant approach to progress in the understanding of the translocation mechanism underlying such a process. As a first step, in line with the above biochemical studies, we analysed the import capacity of mitochondria isolated from strains mutated in VDAC genes. <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> possesses two VDAC-encoding genes, <italic>POR1</italic> and <italic>POR2</italic><xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. The originally identified <italic>POR1</italic> gene encodes VDAC-1, the major isoform. <italic>POR2</italic> encoding VDAC-2 was subsequently identified in a screen for genes which, upon overexpression, could functionally complement the defects of <italic>POR1</italic>-deleted strains, although its pore forming ability has been questioned <xref rid="bib19 bib29" ref-type="bibr">[19,29]</xref>. Mitochondria isolated from the <italic>&#x00394;por1</italic> strain M22-2 deleted for most of the <italic>POR1</italic> gene showed a strongly reduced DNA uptake capacity versus those from the control strain M3 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>A, lanes 1 and 2). The absence of the VDAC-1 protein was assessed through western blot analysis with an antiserum specific for this isoform (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>B, lanes 4 and 5). Mitochondria from the <italic>&#x00394;por2</italic> strain M3-2 lacking the coding sequence of the <italic>POR2</italic> gene had also lost most of their DNA import competence (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>A, lanes 1 and 3). The genetic tractability of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> thus allowed us to show that individual depletion of the genes encoding the VDAC isoforms severely restricts DNA import into yeast mitochondria. Strikingly, deletion of neither VDAC isoform was sufficient to completely prevent protection of some DNA following the import assay. In particular, the depletion in protected DNA that was seen repeatedly following the import assay with mitochondria from the <italic>&#x00394;por2</italic> strain further questions the mechanism, since it has been suggested that VDAC-2, contrary to VDAC-1, may not normally form a channel <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. This suggests that VDAC-1 alone is not sufficient to maintain maximal DNA uptake, although it is present at a normal level in the <italic>&#x00394;por2</italic> strain (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>B, lane 6). Two ideas can be put forward to explain such a situation. The first is that, although the DNA would translocate through the channels formed by VDAC-1, VDAC-2 would have a major contribution to its recruitment and binding to the mitochondrial membrane. A second possibility is that VDAC-1 and VDAC-2 would form a &#x0201c;DNA import pore&#x0201d; as a heterodimer. The two hypotheses are not necessarily mutually exclusive.</p></sec><sec><label>3.4</label><title>DNA associates with a high molecular weight mitochondrial protein complex potentially containing the VDAC</title><p>As a preliminary approach to identify candidate partners of the VDAC in the DNA uptake process, we reasoned that some radiolabeled DNA substrate would maintain an interaction with complexes involved in its recognition and mitochondrial translocation, allowing the detection and identification of these complexes by proteomic analysis. For that purpose, the mitochondrial membrane fraction was recovered from standard DNA import samples and solubilised with the soft detergent digitonin, so as to release native protein complexes. The latter were separated by electrophoresis on Blue Native polyacrylamide gels (BN-PAGE). Exposure of the Blue Native gel indeed revealed the incorporation of the radioactive DNA into a high molecular weight structure in the range of 500&#x000a0;kDa (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>A). A gel sample matching the putative complex was recovered and the retained DNA was phenol extracted and analysed on an agarose gel (not shown). It turned out that, likely due to remaining nucleases, the initial probe had been cleaved during the experimental steps run in native conditions, so that fragments in the range of 100 nucleotides were actually retained and protected in the high molecular weight complex. The influence of the DNA itself on the migration of the latter was thus limited.</p><p>Mass spectrometry analysis of the protein content in the area of the Blue Native gel matching the radioactive complex identified a number of subunits of complex III and of the ATP synthase, <italic>i.e.</italic> proteins from major and abundant high molecular weight mitochondrial components (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>B). However, in line with the above data, nano-LC-MSMS also detected the VDAC-1 (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>B). Migration of this polypeptide in the upper part of the gel was only understandable through its presence in a large structure and suggested that the VDAC may engage into high molecular weight complexes which interact with the DNA. Finally, the gel area matching the radioactive complex contained a further protein, the adenine nucleotide translocator (ANT) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>B). It can be argued that the ANT and the phosphate carrier have been proposed to associate with the ATP synthase to form the ATP synthasome <xref rid="bib30 bib31" ref-type="bibr">[30,31]</xref>, which could explain the presence of the ANT in the high molecular weight fraction. Still, the identification of the ANT in the same fraction as the VDAC and the DNA is of interest, as a role of this carrier in DNA translocation was suggested by previous assays showing a strong inhibition of DNA uptake into plant mitochondria in the presence of the ANT ligand ADP or the inhibitor atractyloside <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. These data altogether make the ANT a relevant candidate for a genetic analysis with <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> mutants. However, carboxyatractyloside had no effect on DNA import into mammalian mitochondria <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, highlighting a potential limitation of a general approach, <italic>i.e.</italic> significant differences may exist between organisms in the mitochondrial DNA import mechanism.</p></sec><sec><label>3.5</label><title>Mutation of both VDAC genes reprogrammes mitochondrial membrane composition and maintains DNA import competence</title><p>Assaying mitochondria from the <italic>&#x00394;por1</italic>&#x02013;<italic>&#x00394;por2</italic> double mutant strain M22-2-1 showed the limits of the yeast genetic approach, as it seems that <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> cells can in some cases develop substitution strategies for insufficient or deleted mitochondrial functions. Deletion of both VDAC genes at the same time led to substantial alteration of the mitochondrial membrane protein composition, as observed upon 1D SDS-PAGE (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>A). Whereas the membrane protein profile generated by mitochondria from the <italic>&#x00394;por1</italic> or <italic>&#x00394;por2</italic> mutant remained close to the control (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>A, lanes 1 to 3), the level of most of these polypeptides was very low in the profile corresponding to the organelles from the <italic>&#x00394;por1</italic>&#x02013;<italic>&#x00394;por2</italic> double mutant (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>A, lane 4). Instead, three other proteins became predominant, namely HSP26, prohibitin-1 and ATPase-1, as identified by mass spectrometry. The level of ATP synthase subunit &#x003b2; remained unchanged. HSP26 is the principal small heat shock protein of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic><xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref> and forms shell-like particles <xref rid="bib33 bib34" ref-type="bibr">[33,34]</xref>. Its activity is temperature dependent and controlled by the rearrangement of a thermosensor domain <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. Prohibitins are believed to be chaperones but can form membrane-bound ring complexes associated with the mitochondrial inner membrane <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. ATPase-1 (<italic>e.g.</italic><xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>) was previously found associated mainly with the plasma membrane but also with other subcellular compartments, including mitochondria <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. It is a proton pump and the gradient it generates drives the transport of nutrients by H<sup>+</sup>-symport.</p><p>These observations established that the <italic>por1</italic>/<italic>por2</italic> double knockout caused substantial nuclear reprogramming destined to maintain sustainable mitochondrial transport capability. Such double mutants were indeed shown earlier to be viable and able to grow on glycerol at 30&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, implying that, in the absence of VDAC expression, they had developed compensatory pathway(s) for the transport of solutes through the outer membrane. Strikingly, these alternative mechanisms were also able to ensure DNA translocation, as the DNA import capacity of the mitochondria from the <italic>&#x00394;por1</italic>&#x02013;<italic>&#x00394;por2</italic> double mutant was almost equivalent to that of organelles from the parental strain (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>B). However, it was obvious from the above data that this DNA transport process was not representative of the regular DNA import pathway we wish to decipher. Notably, previous studies demonstrated that upon deletion or insufficient permeability of VDAC-1, the TOM complex (translocase of the outer membrane) partially substitutes for the VDAC channel in the transport of external solutes, such as the dinucleotide NADH, through the outer membrane <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. The phenomenon includes upregulation of TOM proteins. Drawing a parallel with existing data on the mitochondrial import of cytosolic transfer RNAs (tRNAs), this could be an interesting idea to consider for an alternative pathway of DNA uptake into mitochondria from the <italic>&#x00394;por1</italic>&#x02013;<italic>&#x00394;por2</italic> double mutant. Indeed, natural import of cytosolic tRNA<sup>Lys</sup> into <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> mitochondria requires a functional protein import pathway <xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref> and mitochondrial import of tRNAs in plants is likely to involve some of the TOM proteins, namely TOM20 and TOM40, besides the VDAC <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>.</p></sec></sec><sec><label>4</label><title>Conclusion</title><p>Why is it so important to understand natural competence, especially when all the experiments have to date been performed with isolated organelles? Transfection of plant and mammalian mitochondria is an extremely desirable goal for many reasons, both for pure and applied biology. The expression of imported foreign DNA from within the mitochondrion in a higher eukaryote cell has yet to be demonstrated. There are many difficulties that need to be addressed when considering effective mitochondrial transfection. One of these obstacles is considered to be the uptake of DNA into mitochondria. Therefore, even if one was able to design a mitochondrial mini-vector that should be retained and expressed in mitochondria, initial targeting and uptake of the DNA has always been seen to be a major difficulty in situ. The observation that mitochondria have retained an ability to import naked DNA makes this difficulty resolvable. Results now consistently establish that isolated mitochondria can import DNA fragments of over 10&#x000a0;kb in size. Imported DNA acts as a template for DNA and RNA synthesis in plant and mammalian mitochondria <xref rid="bib16 bib17" ref-type="bibr">[16,17]</xref>. Further, in mammalian mitochondria the transcript generated from the exogenous template has been shown to be processed and matured. However, to delineate the process and to identify the important players are essential. It is especially striking that, although they may have an influence in some cases, neither membrane potential nor exogenous ATP are strictly required, begging the question of how the import of such a large polyanion can be driven.</p><p>Perhaps the greatest challenge is to understand how DNA can cross the impenetrable barrier of the inner membrane and to determine what the key factors in this process are. Classic mitochondrial solute transporters that are involved in nucleotide transport would seem to be too small to facilitate polynucleotide import. However, this is a very large family of proteins, many of which have yet to be characterised (for review see <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>). Impressive advances have been made in reconstituting several of these proteins <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. Now that natural competence of yeast mitochondria has been shown, the large bank of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strains carrying mutations in these family members makes it possible to screen for deficiencies in DNA import and hasten our identification of its key players, keeping in mind the limits highlighted in the present work.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are very grateful to Dr. M.
