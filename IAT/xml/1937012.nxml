We have examined the duplicated histone deacetylases Sir2p and Hst1p in <named-content content-type="genus-species">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</named-content> and find that these paralogs with non-overlapping functions can provide genetic robustness against null mutations through a substitution mechanism. Hst1p is an NAD<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>-dependent histone deacetylase that acts with Sum1p to repress a subset of midsporulation genes. However, <italic>hst1</italic>&#x00394; mutants show much weaker derepression of target loci than <italic>sum1</italic>&#x00394; mutants. We show that this modest derepression of target loci in <italic>hst1</italic>&#x00394; strains occurs in part because Sir2p substitutes for Hst1p. Sir2p contributes to repression of the midsporulation genes only in the absence of Hst1p and is recruited to target promoters by a physical interaction with the Sum1 complex. Furthermore, when Sir2p associates with the Sum1 complex, the complex continues to repress in a promoter-specific manner and does not spread. Our results imply that after the duplication, <italic>SIR2</italic> and <italic>HST1</italic> subfunctionalized. The single <italic>SIR2/HST1</italic> gene from <italic>Kluyveromyces lactis,</italic> a closely related species that diverged prior to the duplication, can suppress an <italic>hst1</italic>&#x00394; mutation in <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. cerevisiae</named-content> as well as interact with Sir4p in <italic>S. cerevisiae.</italic> In addition, the existence of two distinct protein interaction domains for the Sir and Sum1 complexes was revealed through the analysis of a chimeric Sir2&#x02013;Hst1 molecule. Therefore, the ability of Sir2p to substitute for Hst1p probably results from a retained but reduced affinity for the Sum1 complex that is a consequence of subfunctionalization via the duplication, degeneration, and complementation mechanism. These results suggest that the evolutionary path of duplicate gene preservation may be an important indicator for the ability of duplicated genes to contribute to genetic robustness.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>Gene duplication is an important force in evolution, as it provides a source of new genetic material. However, the mechanisms by which duplicated genes are retained and diverge are understudied at the experimental level. We have examined a pair of duplicated histone deacetylases Hst1p and Sir2p from baker's yeast, which are important for distinct types of gene repression. In this study, we show that before the duplication the ancestral histone deacetylase had both Hst1p- and Sir2p-like functions, and after the duplication Sir2p and Hst1p subfunctionalized, giving rise to two distinct proteins with normally nonoverlapping functions. Despite having partitioned the ancestral functions after the duplication, Sir2p can substitute for Hst1p in its absence by interacting with the normal partner of Hst1p. This study suggests that the evolutionary path of duplicate gene preservation may be an important indicator for the ability of duplicated genes to substitute for one another and hence protect the organism against deleterious mutations.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Hickman MA, Rusche LN (2007) Substitution as a mechanism for genetic robustness: The duplicated deacetylases Hst1p and Sir2p in <named-content content-type="genus-species">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</named-content>.

It has been hypothesized that duplicate gene pairs with high sequence similarity are more likely to be functionally redundant and contribute to genetic robustness against deleterious mutations, whereas duplicate gene pairs with low sequence similarity have diverged to such an extent to no longer be able to functionally complement each other. However, there is no correlation between sequence similarity between duplicates and their contribution to genetic robustness &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030126-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d;. Indeed, regardless of sequence divergence, gene duplicates arising from a whole genome duplication in <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. cerevisiae</named-content> are less likely than singleton genes to be essential &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030126-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;. However, it remains unclear how duplicated genes that have diverged from each other in sequence and function can provide genetic robustness against deleterious mutations. Previous genome-wide studies have been limited in their ability to deduce a molecular mechanism for gene duplication in genetic robustness because phenotypes were assessed without regard to gene function. In this study, we have investigated in detail how the nonredundant duplicated gene pair <italic>HST1</italic> and <italic>SIR2</italic> in <named-content content-type="genus-species">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</named-content> functions to provide genetic robustness against null mutation.</p><p>In <italic>S. cerevisiae,</italic> Hst1p is an NAD<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>-dependent histone deacetylase that acts with the protein Sum1p to repress a subset of midsporulation genes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030126-b009">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030126-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;<italic>.</italic> Hst1p deacetylates histones H3 and H4 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030126-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;, and this deacetylation is thought to be important for its repressive function. Sum1p is a DNA binding protein that associates with the middle sporulation element (MSE), a conserved sequence found primarily in midsporulation gene promoters &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030126-b012">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030126-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d;. The third member of the Sum1 complex, Rfm1p, is a small protein thought to serve an architectural role by associating with both Sum1p and Hst1p &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030126-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;. There are two noteworthy differences among phenotypes of <italic>sum1</italic>&#x00394;, <italic>rfm1</italic>&#x00394;, and <italic>hst1</italic>&#x00394; null mutations. First, the subset of midsporulation genes derepressed in these backgrounds differs. One group of genes requires Rfm1p and Hst1p in addition to Sum1p; the other group requires only Sum1p for repression &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030126-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;. Second, for genes that are repressed by both Sum1p and Hst1p, there is a difference in the level of derepression of target loci between <italic>sum1</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>hst1</italic>&#x00394; strain backgrounds &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030126-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;. Deletion of Sum1p results in a strong derepression of target midsporulation genes, whereas deletion of Hst1p results in a modest derepression of the same target midsporulation genes. It has been unclear what contributes to this difference in phenotypes.</p><p>Hst1p is a member of the Sir2 family of NAD<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>-dependent deacetylases. These enzymes have a highly conserved catalytic core domain and variable terminal extensions.

Sir2p deacetylates nearby nucleosomes, creating new high affinity binding sites for Sir3p and Sir4p, which in turn recruit additional Sir2p to the newly deacetylated nucleosomes. As the Sir proteins spread, they generate a specialized chromatin structure that is restrictive to transcription and independent of DNA sequence. Sir2p is also part of the RENT complex (Regulator of nucleolar silencing and telophase exit), which modulates chromatin structure in the rDNA repeats &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030126-b034">34</xref>&#x0005d;.

To determine whether such determinants exist, a chimeric Sir2&#x02013;Hst1p molecule was constructed in which the N terminus of Sir2p was fused to the catalytic core of Hst1p. The junction of the Sir2&#x02013;Hst1 chimera was at the start of the catalytic core domain, such that amino acids 1&#x02013;255 of Sir2p were fused to amino acids 201&#x02013;503 from Hst1p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030126-g006">Figure 6</xref>A), generating HA<italic>-</italic>Sir2<sub>1&#x02212;255</sub>-Hst1<sub>201&#x02212;503</sub>p.

Deletion of both <italic>HST1</italic> and <italic>SIR2</italic> results in dramatically greater derepression of Sum1p-repressed genes than observed in an <italic>hst1</italic>&#x00394; background. This additional derepression is not observed when other related NAD<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>-dependent deacetylases or other silencing factors are deleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030126-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Furthermore, Sir2p localizes to the promoters of Hst1p-repressed loci through an interaction with the Sum1 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030126-g002">Figure 2</xref>) and acts as a histone deacetylase at these loci in the absence of Hst1p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030126-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Based on these results, we propose a substitution model rather than genetic redundancy to explain the overlapping roles of this duplicate gene pair. We consider this phenomenon as substitution and not redundancy because Sir2p-mediated repression at Hst1-regulated genes is not as proficient as wild-type Hst1p-mediated repression and only occurs when Hst1p is absent. We propose that this substitution by Sir2p in an <italic>hst1</italic>&#x00394; background accounts for some of the difference in derepression observed between <italic>hst1</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>sum1</italic>&#x00394; strains, although Sir2p substitution did not account for the entire difference in derepression phenotypes between <italic>hst1</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>sum1</italic>&#x00394; strains. It is possible that another deacetylase may also have limited ability to substitute, or it could be that Sum1p has repressive properties that are independent of a deacetylase.</p><p>It has also been observed by others that Hst1p substitutes for Sir2p in a <italic>sir2</italic>&#x00394; background. Overexpression of Hst1p from a high copy plasmid partially suppresses <italic>sir2</italic>&#x00394; mating defects in MAT&#x003b1; cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030126-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;. However, this suppression does not completely restore function, as genetic redundancy would predict, because mating efficiency is still about 30-fold lower than in a wild-type strain. Given that overexpression of Hst1p is required to observe this effect, Hst1p may be less capable of substituting for Sir2p than Sir2p is capable of substituting for Hst1p. The requirement for multiple Sir2p&#x02013;Sir4p complexes to silence a single <italic>HMR</italic> locus may also reduce the ability of Hst1p to substitute for Sir2p. This is in contrast to what is considered to be a single Hst1p&#x02013;Sum1p complex required for repression, which would make it easier for Sir2p to substitute for Hst1p, even if the affinity of Hst1p for the Sir complex were comparable to the affinity of Sir2p for the Sum1 complex. Regardless, this previously published result is consistent with our model of the duplicated <italic>SIR2</italic>&#x02013;<italic>HST1</italic> gene pair acting as substitutes for each other. This type of biological phenomenon has been proposed previously as the imposter model, with some controversy, for the MAP kinases Fus3p and Kss1p in <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. cerevisiae</named-content> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030126-b045">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030126-b046">46</xref>&#x0005d;. However, our study has further developed this model to consider the evolutionary relationships between substituting proteins.</p><p>This substitution is likely a consequence of <italic>SIR2</italic> and <italic>HST1</italic> originating by duplication. Duplication has been proposed to be a strong evolutionary force because it generates a source of new genetic material that is free of selective constraint &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030126-b001">1</xref>&#x0005d;. Duplicated genes have two ultimate fates: degeneration or preservation in the genome. Clearly <italic>SIR2</italic> and <italic>HST1</italic> have been retained. Two models have been proposed outlining the steps towards preservation. The classical model proposed that the only way to preserve duplicated genes is through neofunctionalization, in which one of the duplicate genes evolves a new function by acquiring beneficial mutations, while the other gene retains the original function. In such a case, it is predicted that the gene with the new function will experience a more rapid change in sequence, i.e., &#x0201c;accelerated evolution,&#x0201d; compared with the duplicate retaining the original function. A more recent paradigm for the preservation of duplicated genes has been proposed &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030126-b047">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030126-b048">48</xref>&#x0005d; to account for the much larger retention of duplicate genes than the classical model would predict. This new model of duplication, degeneration, and complementation (DDC) states that if the ancestral gene had multiple functions, duplicate genes can each lose one of the original functions by degenerative mutations, while still retaining a different ancestral function. The DDC mechanism was originally proposed in the context of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements of duplicated gene pairs. However, our work suggests that the DDC mechanism can also act on protein coding sequences.</p><p>This study provides evidence to suggest that the ancestral <italic>SIR2&#x02013;HST1</italic> gene provided both <italic>SIR2</italic>- and <italic>HST1</italic>-like functions.

Two different specificity determinants in Sir2p and Hst1p have been found; a domain specific for determining an interaction with the Sum1 complex residing in the C terminus of Hst1p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030126-g006">Figure 6</xref>), specifically Q324 and I325 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030126-b042">42</xref>&#x0005d;, and a domain specific for conferring an interaction with the Sir complex in amino acids 12&#x02013;209 of the N terminus of Sir2p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030126-g007">Figure 7</xref>) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030126-b042">42</xref>&#x0005d;. These interaction domains have likely been conserved subsequent to the duplication. We propose a scenario in which, after the duplication, Hst1p acquired degenerative mutations in the N-terminal domain that interacts with the Sir complex, leading to the loss of affinity for Sir4p, yet maintaining its ability to interact with the Sum1 complex. Sir2p, on the other hand, acquired degenerative mutations in the C-terminal domain required for interaction with the Sum1 complex, leading to reduced affinity for the Sum1 complex, while maintaining a strong interaction with the Sir complex. Nevertheless, Sir2p has retained an interaction domain for the Sum1 complex, although it has a weaker affinity for this complex than Hst1p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030126-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Interestingly, of the two amino acids Q324 and I325, important for Hst1p specificity for the Sum1 complex in <italic>S. cerevisiae,</italic> only the isoleucine is conserved in <named-content content-type="genus-species">K. lactis</named-content> (K434 and I435). However, KlSir2p can fully suppress an <italic>hst1</italic>&#x00394; mutation in <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. cerevisiae</named-content> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030126-g008">Figure 8</xref>). There may be additional residues in Hst1p that confer an interaction with the Sum1 complex but are conserved between ScHst1p, ScSir2p, and KlSir2p.</p><p>In this study we suggest that the particular evolutionary path taken as duplicated genes diverge from one another may be an important indicator of their potential contribution to genetic robustness. Duplicates that have subfunctionalized through a DDC mechanism may be more likely to substitute for each other than duplicates that display accelerated evolution or neofunctionalizion. <italic>SIR3</italic> and <italic>ORC1</italic> represent a pair of duplicated genes arising from the whole genome duplication that, in contrast to <italic>SIR2</italic> and <italic>HST1</italic>, experienced accelerated evolution &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030126-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d;. Orc1p is an essential component of the origin recognition complex. Deletion of <italic>ORC1</italic> results in lethality, and Sir3p cannot complement an <italic>orc1</italic> mutation. Likewise, Orc1p cannot suppress a <italic>sir3</italic>&#x00394; mating defect &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030126-b049">49</xref>&#x0005d;. <italic>ORC1</italic> and <italic>SIR3</italic> are clearly an example of a duplicated gene pair that does not provide genetic robustness.</p><p>These results illustrate how gene duplication can provide genetic robustness against null mutations. It has been shown in <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. cerevisiae</named-content> that genes with duplicates are significantly more likely to have a weaker fitness defect phenotype compared to nonduplicated genes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030126-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030126-b050">50</xref>&#x0005d;. Here, we present data revealing that duplication provides genetic robustness through substitution not redundancy. This is an important distinction because about 550 duplicated gene pairs in <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. cerevisiae</named-content> were retained after the genome duplication &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030126-b025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030126-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d;, and many of these duplicates have diverged from each other &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030126-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d;. It is quite likely that there are other duplicate genes, in addition to <italic>SIR2</italic> and <italic>HST1,</italic> which in wild-type backgrounds have nonoverlapping functions, yet, are able to substitute for one another in the event of a deletion. The biological significance of this phenomenon will be reflected in a null phenotype that underestimates or masks the real function of the deleted gene. Thus, one should apply caution in interpreting deletion phenotypes, particularly if it is known that the gene of interest has a retained duplicate. Our study also demonstrates that, in the case of an enzyme, the use of an inactivating mutation that abolishes enzymatic activity may be more useful in characterizing protein function than a complete deletion because such inactivating mutations retain the protein in the cell and thereby prevent an alternative protein from taking its place.</p><p>Finally, we can draw some conclusions about the relationship between different transcriptional repression mechanisms. It is clear from this study that deacetylation is an important component of Sum1p-mediated repression, as it is in Sir-mediated silencing. However, there is no intrinsic property of the deacetylase that determines whether it will act in a promoter-specific or regional manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0030126-g006">Figure 6</xref>). The results described here are consistent with our previous results indicating that a mutant form of Sum1p does spread and that this spreading requires the deacetylase activity of Hst1p rather than Sir2p &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030126-b036">36</xref>&#x0005d;. Therefore, the tendency for a repressor complex to spread or not to spread is probably a function of the DNA or histone binding proteins with which the histone deacetylase associates. Sir2p is able to spread because its partners, Sir3p and Sir4p are able to spread. In fact, Sir3p and Sir4p can spread in the absence of Sir2p deacetylase activity when the histone tails mimic a deacetylated state &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030126-b051">51</xref>&#x0005d;, supporting the model that the role of Sir2p is to provide a substrate for its partners to bind. In contrast to Sir2p, Hst1p does not spread because its partner, Sum1p, normally does not spread &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030126-b036">36</xref>&#x0005d;. This model is consistent with the hypothesis that the single ancestral histone deacetylase associated with both spreading (Sir) and nonspreading (Sum1) complexes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Yeast strains.</title><p>Strains used in this study were all derived from W303-1a (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0030126-t001">Table 1</xref>).
