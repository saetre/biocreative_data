Although pathologic vascular leak has been implicated in the pathogenesis of ARDS and sepsis-associated lung injury, the mechanisms promoting leak are incompletely understood. Angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2), a known antagonist of the endothelial Tie-2 receptor, was originally described as a naturally occurring disruptor of normal embryonic vascular development otherwise mediated by the Tie-2 agonist angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1). We hypothesized that Ang-2 contributes to endothelial barrier disruption in sepsis-associated lung injury, a condition involving the mature vasculature.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Methods and Findings</title><p>We describe complementary human, murine, and in vitro investigations that implicate Ang-2 as a mediator of this process. We show that circulating Ang-2 is significantly elevated in humans with sepsis who have impaired oxygenation. We then show that serum from these patients disrupts endothelial architecture. This effect of sepsis serum from humans correlates with measured Ang-2, abates with clinical improvement, and is reversed by Ang-1. Next, we found that endothelial barrier disruption can be provoked by Ang-2 alone. This signal is transduced through myosin light chain phosphorylation. Last, we show that excess systemic Ang-2 provokes pulmonary leak and congestion in otherwise healthy adult mice.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our results identify a critical role for Ang-2 in disrupting normal pulmonary endothelial function.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>A series of studies in sepsis patients, mice, and cultured endothelial cells suggest that excess levels of Ang-2 can provoke pulmonary leak and congestion and might be responsible for sepsis-associated Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Sepsis is characterized by a systemic inflammatory response to a microbial pathogen. In the United States, this illness accounts for 2&#x00025;&#x02013;3&#x00025; of all hospital admissions (&#x0223c;650,000 per year to major hospitals), carries a mortality of &#x0223c;30&#x00025;, and has estimated annual direct costs in excess of $16 billion &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030046-b001">1</xref>&#x0005d;. Although the mortality associated with sepsis has declined in the past 20 years &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030046-b002">2</xref>&#x0005d;, it remains a common and deadly condition.

A dramatic manifestation of this phenomenon is acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), a complication that occurs in up to 40&#x00025; of patients with sepsis and is marked by leakage of fluid out of pulmonary capillaries and into alveolar septa and air spaces &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030046-b004">4</xref>&#x0005d;. Excess extravascular fluid in the lung impairs gas exchange across the alveolar membrane and decreases lung compliance.

Myosin light chain (MLC), in its phosphorylated form (MLC-p), mediates contraction in a wide variety of cells, including the microvascular endothelium. An increase in contractile force within ECs&#x02014;via MLC-p&#x02014;is associated with increased permeability &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030046-b008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030046-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;; conversely, blockade of MLC-p reduces trans-endothelial permeability &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030046-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1) and angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) are peptide ligands that bind the Tie-2 receptor tyrosine kinase found primarily on ECs.

Together these reports suggested (a) that an imbalance in Tie-2 signaling could arise in the inflammatory milieu of sepsis, and (b) that, should such an imbalance arise, the lung might be preferentially affected.</p><p>We therefore hypothesized that excess Ang-2 signaling may occur in sepsis, promoting pulmonary vascular leak through up-regulation of MLC-p. We explored this question in several settings: (1) humans with sepsis in whom circulating Ang-2 levels were measured, (2) EC monolayers in which signaling and structural responses to sepsis serum from humans and recombinant human Ang-2 were assessed, and (3) a rodent model in which vascular leak was quantified.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Patients</title><p>Every weekday during a 2-mo period, all patients admitted during the preceding 24 h to the medical intensive care unit at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center were screened for study eligibility.

(In preliminary experiments with control mice, <italic>n</italic> = 6, we confirmed that the retro-orbital sinus provided a route of intravascular injection that allowed near-100&#x00025; delivery of Evans blue in a reproducible fashion.) 10 min after Evans blue injection, mice were sacrificed and perfused with PBS with 2mM EDTA for 10 min through a cannula placed in the right ventricle. Blood and PBS were vented through an incision in the vena cava, thus allowing perfusate to pass through the pulmonary and systemic circulations. After 10 min of perfusing the right ventricle with PBS, the outflow from the vena cava was observed to be clear, confirming that blood (and intravascular Evans blue) had been flushed out of the circulation. Washout of intravascular contents was also confirmed histologically after 10 min of PBS perfusion. Organs were then harvested and homogenized in 1.5 ml of formamide. Evans blue was extracted by incubating the samples at 70 &#x000b0;C for 24 h, and the concentration of Evans blue was estimated by dual-wavelength spectrophotometer (620 nm and 740 nm).

Such suggested effects of Ang-2 on muscle cells may even occur in a Tie-2-independent fashion, as one recent report asserts &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030046-b046">46</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Our data point to <italic>activation</italic> of a signaling system (Rho-kinase, EC MLCK) upon <italic>withdrawal</italic> of Tie-2 phosphorylation. The likeliest explanations for this observation are either (a) that the activated receptor is sequestering an activator of the Rho-kinase pathway or (b) that the activated receptor up-regulates an inhibitor of the Rho-kinase pathway. We are exploring several candidate mediators that meet these criteria to bridge this signaling gap. Though the entire pathway remains to be mapped, there are immediate therapeutic implications of the data presented here.</p><p>MLC-p may represent a final common pathway for multiple provocateurs of vascular leak&#x02014;TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-1, complement components&#x02014;to exert their pathologic pro-permeability effect &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030046-b047">47</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030046-b049">49</xref>&#x0005d;. Inhibitors along this pathway, such as a RhoA inhibitor, would be predicted to block vascular leak. Blockade of one downstream target of RhoA, EC MLCK (by conditional knock-out and chemical inhibition), has already been shown to protect mice from endotoxin-mediated lung injury, further bolstering this hypothesis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030046-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Inhibition of EC MLCK may allow clinicians to treat poor barrier function without direct immunomodulation, as opposed to blockade of TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-1, or complement proteins, all of which are interventions that also affect innate and/or adaptive immunity. Undesired pleiotropic effects, such as poorly timed immunosuppression, may be one reason why these therapies have failed in clinical trials for sepsis. Theoretical advantages of directing therapy to Tie-2 to prevent, stabilize, or reverse leak conditions such as sepsis are the lack of global immunosuppression and the expected restriction of effects to the vasculature, particularly to the pulmonary vasculature where Tie-2 is most abundantly expressed. This remains a hypothesis until a clinical trial demonstrates the benefit in sepsis/ARDS, but one report has shown a beneficial effect of Tie-2 agonism in a mouse endotoxin model of shock &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030046-b050">50</xref>&#x0005d;; another study has shown that locally elevated Ang-2 can provoke extravasation in the mouse hind paw &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030046-b051">51</xref>&#x0005d;. These results independently affirm the notion of an Ang-1&#x02013;Ang-2 toggle that tips in favor of the latter to promote vascular leak.</p><p>The clinical data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0030046-g001">Figures 1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0030046-g003">3</xref> come from a pilot cohort of patients with sepsis. Undoubtedly, a larger study is needed, particularly one that enrolls ARDS patients who do not have sepsis, to test whether Ang-2 is a valid biomarker for diagnosis, stratification, or prognosis in this condition. However, despite the small sample size and the relative wellness of the patients we studied, we were still able to identify a robust correlation between very poor PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub> ratio and Ang-2 elevation. We observed that peak Ang-2 did occur at the same time as nadir PaO<sub>2</sub>/FiO<sub>2</sub> ratio, and that peak Ang-2 followed the most severe stage of illness by &#x0223c;24 h (unpublished data). The delayed rise in Ang-2 following the most severe stage of illness may imply that an angiopoietin-signaling disturbance occurs as a secondary phenomenon to release of early-phase cytokines such as TNF-&#x003b1;. But, given that ARDS due to non-pulmonary causes also classically occurs as a delayed phenomenon, the later rise in Ang-2 may help explain why the delay in extra-pulmonary ARDS onset exists.</p><p>If Ang-2 is confirmed as a relevant biomarker of acute lung injury, then it may help to determine prognosis and to stratify patients, especially in clinical trials to treat ARDS. Given the rapidity with which Ang-2 rises in severe sepsis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0030046-g002">Figure 2</xref>, Patient AG, &#x02014;&#x025cb;&#x02014;), it is less likely to be an effective screening tool if tested only one time several days before onset of permeability edema in the lungs. On the other hand, if serial Ang-2 values are followed in at-risk patients, then a rising slope could identify someone who would particularly benefit from therapy directed against leak itself in an effort to halt the evolution of ARDS at its earliest exudative phase.</p><p>Our results must be interpreted with caution. We have shown a correlation between serum Ang-2 and poor gas exchange in patients with severe sepsis. The correlation may not be causative, and several alternate possibilities must be ruled out in future investigations. First, based on the anti-leakage effect of Ang-1 on mature vasculature &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030046-b017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030046-b052">52</xref>&#x0005d; and the pro-leakage phenotype we have observed with excess Ang-2, we believe Ang-2 is acting as a Tie-2 antagonist in the setting of sepsis as per its initial description &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030046-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;, but it is worth remembering that the action of Ang-2 on Tie-2 appears to be dose-, duration-, and context-specific in vitro &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030046-b012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030046-b053">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030046-b054">54</xref>&#x0005d;. Second, Ang-2 release can be driven by inflammatory stimuli such as TNF-&#x003b1; that are clearly present in sepsis, and, therefore, Ang-2 elevation may represent only an epiphenomenon without functional significance&#x02014;this is less likely as our results demonstrate actual pathologic effects, in vitro and in vivo, of excess Ang-2 alone.</p><p>Several additional questions remain to be answered in future studies. First, as mentioned, Ang-2 is a known hypoxia-induced gene product &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030046-b055">55</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030046-b057">57</xref>&#x0005d;, but its source(s) in sepsis are unclear. A study of critically ill patients with hypoxia but without sepsis, such as those with cardiogenic shock, would help elucidate whether hypoxia alone induces pathologic elevation in circulating Ang-2.</p><p>Second, Ang-2 expression is also up-regulated by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030046-b057">57</xref>&#x0005d;. Interestingly, serum VEGF appears to be elevated in severe sepsis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030046-b058">58</xref>&#x0005d;. VEGF is known to be a pro-permeability ligand, but it may be that Ang-2 partially mediates VEGF's permeability effect; alternatively, VEGF and Ang-2 may be acting in parallel to provoke vascular leak. However, VEGF blockade alone did not improve survival in one report studying a well-accepted rodent model of sepsis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030046-b059">59</xref>&#x0005d;. Our results suggest that excess Ang-2 is sufficient to promote pulmonary vascular leak and congestion, but pending experiments to block Ang-2 action in sepsis/ARDS models will help assess the relative contributions of VEGF and Ang-2 to sepsis/ARDS more definitively.</p><p>Third, pre-formed Ang-2 can be released from ECs stimulated by inflammatory ligands, such as TNF-&#x003b1; &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030046-b060">60</xref>&#x0005d;, or even released non-specifically following EC death. What remains to be determined is what cell type(s) and what organ(s) account for the elevated Ang-2 level. Apoptosis alone is unlikely to account for Ang-2 elevation for two reasons: (a) under conditions in which only limited apoptosis is observed following in vitro stimulation of ECs with endotoxin, significant up-regulation of Ang-2 is noted (unpublished data); moreover, (b) endotoxin stimulation in vivo also appears to result in organ-specific up-regulation of Ang-2 transcription (unpublished data).</p><p>Finally, the reason underlying the lung's particular susceptibility (as opposed to other organ beds) to fluid extravasation may be as simple as extra reliance on tonic Tie-2 activation, but several other endothelial receptor/ligand pairs may also be involved. More broadly, exploring the impact of the endothelium in other pulmonary diseases may yield valuable insights &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0030046-b061">61</xref>&#x0005d;. Disturbances in other members of the angiopoietin axis&#x02014;e.g., Ang-4, soluble Tie-2&#x02014;in ARDS also need to be explored. Such studies will further define the role of the endothelium&#x02014;as opposed to the epithelium&#x02014;in defending the alveolar permeability barrier.</p><boxed-text id="pmed-0030046-box001" position="float"><sec id="sb1"><title>Patient Summary</title><sec id="sb1a"><title>Background</title><p>Sepsis is a severe illness caused by overwhelming infection of the bloodstream by toxin-producing bacteria. It results from an infection in one part of the body (such as the lungs or the skin) that has then spread throughout the body. In developed countries, the number of deaths due to sepsis has fallen in the past decades. Nevertheless, about 30&#x00025; of patients admitted to hospital with sepsis still die from the disease or the secondary effects of the disease (physicians refer to these secondary effects as &#x0201c;complications&#x0201d;). One of these complications is a severe medical condition of the lungs called acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). In ARDS, small blood vessels in the lungs become leaky and release fluid. This prevents the lungs from doing their job&#x02014;that is, taking up oxygen and disposing of carbon dioxide. Patients experience trouble breathing and usually need to be put on respirators. If the condition lasts too long, the lung tissue becomes damaged, sometimes irreversibly. In the past few years, scientists have begun to understand what keeps blood vessels properly &#x0201c;sealed.&#x0201d; One of the potential players is a protein called Tie-2, which is present on the surface of blood vessel cells and affects their behavior. Tie-2 is itself controlled by a pair of proteins called Ang-1 and Ang-2. When the Ang-1 protein binds to Tie-2, it switches it on. When the Ang-2 protein binds to Tie-2, it switches it off.</p></sec><sec id="sb1b"><title>Why Was This Study Done?</title><p>The researchers wanted to find out whether Tie-2, and the Ang-1 and Ang-2 proteins, might play a role in sepsis and ARDS in humans. In previous research in mice, excess levels of Ang-1 seemed to make blood vessels less leaky than they normally are, suggesting that Ang-2 might have the opposite effect. In humans, lungs have the highest Tie-2 levels of all adult organs, and reduced Tie-2 levels in the lungs have been found in some infants who died from respiratory problems.</p></sec><sec id="sb1c"><title>What Did the Researchers Do and Find?</title><p>They tested whether excess levels of Ang-2 occur in sepsis and could cause leakiness of lung blood vessels in three different ways. First, they measured the level of Ang-2 in the blood of patients with sepsis. Second, they tested whether blood from patients with sepsis could cause leakiness in blood vessels grown in the laboratory. Finally, they tested whether elevated levels of Ang-2 affect the leakiness of blood vessels in the lungs and affect the lungs' proper functioning in mice. They found that Ang-2 levels are raised in patients with sepsis, especially in those that have impaired uptake of oxygen. During the course of the disease, Ang-2 levels mirror a patient's condition: they go up as the condition worsens and go down as the patient gets better. They then showed that treating blood vessels grown in the laboratory with blood from patients with ARDS made these blood vessels leaky. They could get the same results by treating the blood vessels with only Ang-2, and reverse the leakiness by subsequent treatment with Ang-1. Consistent with a key role of Ang-2 in ARDS, they found that injecting Ang-2 into the blood of healthy mice caused ARDS-like symptoms in the mice.</p></sec><sec id="sb1d"><title>What Does This Mean?</title><p>These results suggest that Ang-2 might be a key player in ARDS due to sepsis. The results also suggest that measuring levels of Ang-2 in a patient might be a way for doctors to assess how much lung damage there has been in a patient who has developed ARDS. This new study raises the possibility that reducing Ang-2 levels in patients might help to prevent or improve ARDS in patients with sepsis. Additional studies in patients with sepsis, and in patients with ARDS that is not caused by sepsis, are needed to clarify the roles of Ang-2 and Tie-2 in ARDS and the suitability of Ang-2 as a target for therapy.</p></sec><sec id="sb1e"><title>Where Can I Find More Information Online?</title><p>The following Web sites contain information on ARDS.</p><p>The ARDS Support Center:</p><p><ext-link xlink:href="http://www.ards.org/" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.ards.org/</ext-link></p><p>MedlinePlus:</p><p><ext-link xlink:href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000103.htm" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000103.htm</ext-link></p><p>ARDSNet:</p><p><ext-link xlink:href="http://www.ardsnet.org" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.ardsnet.org</ext-link></p><p>Pages from the American Lung Association:</p><p><ext-link xlink:href="http://www.lungusa.org/site/pp.asp?c=dvLUK9O0E&#x00026;b=35012" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.lungusa.org/site/pp.asp?c=dvLUK9O0E&#x00026;b=35012</ext-link></p><p>Shands Healthcare:</p><p><ext-link xlink:href="http://www.shands.org/health/information/article/000103.htm" ext-link-type="uri">http://www.shands.org/health/information/article/000103.htm</ext-link></p></sec></sec></boxed-text></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by seed funds from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center to VPS.
