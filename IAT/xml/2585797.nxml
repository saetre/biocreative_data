High mobility group 1 (HMG1) protein is a non-histone DNA-binding protein and is highly expressed in different types of tumors. The high expression of HMG1 could alter DNA structure resulting in GCRs. Spt2p is a non-histone DNA binding protein in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> and shares homology with mammalian HMG1 protein. We found that Spt2p overexpression enhances GCRs dependent on proteins for transcription elongation and polyadenylation. Excess Spt2p increases the number of cells in S phase and the amount of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) that might be susceptible to cause DNA damage and GCR. Consistently, RNase H expression, which reduces levels of ssDNA, decreased GCRs in cells expressing high level of Spt2p. Lastly, high transcription in the chromosome V, the location at which GCR is monitored, also enhanced GCR formation. We propose a new pathway for GCR where DNA intermediates formed during transcription can lead to genomic instability.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Transmitting genetic information without creating deleterious genetic alternations is one of the cell's most important tasks. When cells cannot repair DNA damage properly, it leads to genomic instability and results in genetic disorders, including cancer. Many studies, including ours, have started to uncover pathways suppressing one type of genomic instability, gross chromosomal rearrangement (GCR). However, the pathogenic mechanism to promote GCR that could mimic the hyper-activation of oncogenes during tumorigenesis is not clearly understood. The high expression of HMG1 has been documented many times as a putative oncogene. Therefore, we tested whether high expression of its yeast homologue, Spt2p, could induce pathogenic effect including GCR formation. Excess Spt2p expression indeed induced GCR formation dependent on its role in transcription elongation and polyadenylation. Further studies to find mechanisms resided in GCR formation by Spt2p revealed that excess Spt2p increased single-stranded DNA to produce GCR. Our studies provide a mechanistic bridge between transcription and genomic instability.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Maintaining genomic stability is crucial for cell survival and normal cell growth.

To determine whether the level of Spt2p expression affects GCR formation, the GCR frequencies were measured after inducing Spt2p expression for different lengths of time. A slight increase in Spt2p expression after 30 minutes was enough to increase GCR formation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000290.s001">Figure S1A</xref>). The maximum increase in GCRs was achieved after two hours of induction and started to decrease after four hours.

This reduction in GCRs is unlikely due to a reduction in Spt2p expression, as levels of this protein were similar across all strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000290-g001">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p>Spt2p has two mammalian HMG1-like domains in its N terminal half and two C-terminal acidic domains, which are often found in HMG-like proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000290-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Because all four domains have been shown to bind DNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000290-Novoseler1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref> and thus potentially affect GCR formation, we cloned each domain individually and overexpressed them in the same manner as the wild type protein, and monitored GCR frequencies. Overexpression of each domain enhanced GCR in different extent. The highest enhancement was observed when the C-terminal thirty amino acids were overexpressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000290-g002">Figure 2B</xref>).

During transcription, the transcription machinery unwinds the DNA double helix and occupies the noncoding strand to use it as a template for transcription. In addition, transcription produces a transient DNA-RNA hybrid ranging 9 to 12 nucleotides and the coding strand becomes single stranded DNA (ssDNA). It has been shown that the hyper-recombination observed in <italic>hpr1&#x00394;</italic> was due to the induction of the DNA-RNA hybrid with the R-loop formation and could be suppressed by the overexpression of RNase H <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000290-Huertas1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. We therefore hypothesized that abnormal transcription induced by excess Spt2p could increase the number of DNA-RNA hybrids and create larger ssDNA. RNase H can remove RNA from DNA-RNA hybrids. Therefore, we first tested whether removing RNA from DNA-RNA hybrids by RNase H overexpression could reduce GCRs produced by excess Spt2p.

The suppression of GCR by these mutations was specific for excess Spt2p-directed GCRs because the <italic>fir1&#x00394;</italic>, <italic>set1&#x00394;</italic>, or <italic>cdc73&#x00394;</italic> mutation did not suppress the <italic>mre11&#x00394;</italic> mutation-directed GCR formation (data not shown). It should be pointed out that a <italic>set1&#x00394;</italic> or <italic>cdc73&#x00394;</italic> mutation caused a slight growth defect in the <italic>mre11&#x00394;</italic> strain. Transcription synergistically increases the hyper-recombinogenic effect of methyl methane-sulfonate (MMS), suggesting that transcription makes DNA more accessible to genotoxic agents <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000290-GarciaRubio1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>. Transcription also introduces topological change that could lead to transient accumulation of ssDNA. The changes in topology and chromatin structure caused by excess Spt2p could produce ssDNA because more RNA polymerase II could occupy the transcribed strands and result in the enlargement of R loops (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000290-g007">Figure 7</xref>). In addition, excess Spt2p could bind to the collided junction between the DNA replication fork and transcription that mimics a four-way junction structure through its binding activity to four-way junction structure. The longer un-transcribed ssDNA by excess Spt2p is supported by the high-levels of ssDNA, which produced by excess Spt2p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000290-g004">Figure 4</xref>) and the decrease in ssDNA and GCR formation by RNase H, which removes DNA-RNA hybrids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000290-g004">Figure 4A and B</xref>). It has been known that ssDNA is a better substrate for many chemical reactions than double-stranded DNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000290-Frederico1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000290-Skandalis1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>. Long ssDNA can easily be targeted by many modifications including deamination, oxidation as well as simple breaks. Uracil introduced by the deamination of cytosine in ssDNA could be one of the intermediates for GCR formation by excess Spt2p, because expression of human AID that deaminates cytosine increased GCR formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000290-g005">Figure 5A</xref>) and Ung1p, an enzyme responsible for removal of Uracil from DNA is required for GCR caused by excess Spt2p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000290-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). Similar to what we observed, the hyper-recombination in the <italic>hpr1&#x00394;</italic> strain was caused by the increase of DNA-RNA hybrid with the R-loop formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000290-Huertas1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><fig id="pgen-1000290-g007" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1000290.g007</object-id><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>A model for GCR formation caused by excess Spt2p.</title><p>A) DNA replication and transcription independently proceed to avoid unnecessary collision.

In addition, Spt2p could bind the junction between the DNA replication fork and the transcription fork. C) Some unknown AID like protein (Gray circle with ?) could introduce uracil by the deamination of cytocine in the large R loop. Uracil would enable the enzyme Ung1p to make a single strand break.

When there is DNA damage caused by ultra-violet radiation, nucleotide excision repair proteins denature damaged DNA and create bubble structure. Each end of the bubble is targeted by endonucleases to remove the damaged strand. Yeast Rad1p-Rad10p endonuclease that is homologous to human ERCC1-XPF, makes a nick in the bubble <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000290-Tomkinson1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>.

Strong suppression of excess Spt2p-dependent GCR by the <italic>rad1&#x00394;</italic> or the <italic>rad10&#x00394;</italic> mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000290-g001">Figure 1B</xref>) suggests that large R-loops could be targeted by Rad1p-Rad10p endonuclease. However, we could not detect any significant difference in the level of overall transcription in microarray experiments (data not shown), which could be due to subtle difference in the level of transcription.</p><p>Defects in proper DNA replication seem to be a major source of spontaneous GCRs because GCRs accumulate in eukaryotes when S phase checkpoints are abrogated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000290-Casper1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000290-Myung1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>. High levels of transcription may cause more collisions between transcription and DNA replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000290-g007">Figure 7</xref>). Recombination at stalled DNA replication forks increases if there is transcription colliding with it <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000290-Prado1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>. Excess Spt2p increased the population of cells highly in S phase and RNase H could partially reverse this effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000290-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). Therefore, large R loops produced by excess Spt2p could be caused mainly in S phase during DNA replication, presumably due to increased collision between transcription complexes and stalled DNA replication forks. The high increase in GCR in the TEL to CEN strain, containing the highly transcribed <italic>TRP1</italic> gene between two negative selection marker genes <italic>CAN1</italic> and <italic>URA3</italic> supports the collision model for GCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000290-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). This model is further supported by a GCR increase observed in the <italic>GAL-TRP1</italic> strain only when the expression of the <italic>TRP1</italic> gene was induced by galactose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000290-g006">Figure 6F</xref>). Interestingly, the CEN to TEL strain containing the same high transcription <italic>TRP1</italic> gene in a reverse orientation did not cause any significant increase in GCR. It might be due to higher preference of DNA replication in this region of chromosome V from centromeric to telomeric by using ARS507 even though there are multiple late origins at the end of chromosome V. Alternatively, the TEL to CEN strain might have more susceptible chromosome structure for GCR because different orientation of <italic>TRP1</italic> gene could produce different chromosome structures.</p><p>The Rad5p-Rad18p dependent post-replication repair pathway suppresses GCR formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000290-Smith1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000290-Motegi2">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref>. In contrast to Rad18p-Rad6p that monoubiquitinates proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and suppresses GCR formation, Bre1p-Rad6p that monoubiquitinates histone H2B, is required to promote GCR formation in the <italic>rad5&#x00394;, rad18&#x00394;,</italic> or <italic>mec1&#x00394;</italic> strains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000290-Motegi2">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref>. In the present study, we found that GCRs produced by excess Spt2p were also suppressed by the <italic>rad6&#x00394;</italic> or <italic>bre1&#x00394;</italic> mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000290-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). GCRs from each individual clone carrying a GCR were all broken chromosomes healed by <italic>de novo</italic> telomere addition requiring telomerase and the yKu70-yKu80 heterodimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000290-g001">Figure 1B</xref>).

Therefore, it is possible that certain types of GCR could be preferentially generated when DNA damage at stalled forks collide with transcription complexes. Further investigations are necessary to elucidate mechanisms. Intriguingly, Rad5p has a Swi2/Snf2 domain that has been suggested to function in altering chromatin structure. Although there is no direct evidence that yeast Rad5p functions in transcription, it might modulate transcription of genes near the stalled DNA replication forks.</p><p>The HMG1 protein is a non-histone DNA binding protein and regulates the transcription of many genes through its interaction with other proteins involved in transcription.
