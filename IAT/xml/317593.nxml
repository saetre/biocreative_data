SS-B/La, a major target of autoantibodies in lupus and Sjogren's syndrome, has been identified as a 46 kDa protein component of a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) particle implicated in the maturation of RNA polymerase III transcripts. This report describes the complete sequences of human and bovine SS-B/La and the identification of RNA-binding protein consensus sequences RNP1 and RNP2 in the N-terminal region previously shown to be complexed with RNA in UV-crosslinking experiments. Segments of about 95 residues from the RNA-binding domain of SS-B/La and from 29 RNA-binding domains of several other proteins are analysed with respect to the frequency of amino acids and their hydrophobicity at each position. The data suggest that SS-B/La belongs to a large family of RNA-binding proteins which includes heterogeneous nuclear RNPs, nucleolin, mRNA polyadenylate binding protein, and small nuclear RNPs.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00123-0085-a" xlink:role="2238"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00123-0080.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2233"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00123-0081.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2234"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00123-0082.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2235"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00123-0083.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2236"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00123-0084.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2237"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00123-0085.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2238"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00123-0086.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2239"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00123-0087.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2240"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00123-0088.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2241"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00123-0089.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2242"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00123-0090.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2243"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00123-0091.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2244"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
