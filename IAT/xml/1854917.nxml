Although maternal transcripts and proteins are deposited in the egg during oogenesis, the activation of the zygotic genome starts at different stages in different animals and is concomitant with the degradation of a fraction of maternally supplied transcripts &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050117-b001">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050117-b003">3</xref>&#x0005d;. Thus, during the maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT), the embryo undergoes an extensive remodeling of gene expression and must integrate post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms, which are the only ones operating during the previous maternal stages, with transcriptional regulation of its own genome. How this is achieved is poorly understood.</p><p>The concomitant degradation of maternal transcripts and activation of zygotic transcription has made it difficult in any animal to interpret changes in gene expression &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050117-b004">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050117-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d;. Whereas an increase in gene expression levels can be interpreted as a sign of zygotic transcription, a decrease or absence of change is also consistent with zygotic gene activation if it is accompanied by maternal mRNA degradation. One way to test whether a particular RNA is supplied maternally or zygotically is to compare its levels in embryos that have or do not have the corresponding DNA template. Under these conditions, differences in expression level indicate the relative maternal and zygotic contribution. <named-content content-type="genus-species">Drosophila melanogaster</named-content> offers the unique opportunity to perform such an experiment for the entire genome, as it is possible to use chromosomal rearrangements to produce embryos that lack specific arms or even entire chromosomes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050117-b007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050117-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;. Such embryos develop normally until cycle 14 and then show defects characteristic of the chromosomal region deleted. The results of such experiments suggest that the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo develops under the control of maternally provided proteins until nuclear division 13. This stage, usually referred to as the mid-blastula transition (MBT), defines the point from which development comes to be controlled by the zygote's own genome &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050117-b001">1</xref>&#x0005d;. The first morphological signs of the zygotic genome appear with the cellularization of the cortically migrating nuclei and the beginning of gastrulation. From a transcriptional point of view, the zygotic genome is silent until nuclear cycle 9&#x02013;10 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050117-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;. In the germline, this quiescence is maintained until later stages of development, arguing for specific regulation between the soma and the germline &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050117-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>The molecular mechanisms linking the nuclear cycles to the activation of transcription are unknown and may involve the chromosomal squelching of negative regulators of transcription, as has been proposed for the <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryo &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050117-b003">3</xref>&#x0005d;. Chromatin-based mechanisms may also play a role. In the mouse embryo, for example, at least one cycle of DNA replication is required to change the methylation state of the chromatin to a transcriptionally competent conformation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050117-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;. However, in none of these organisms have the molecular players actually regulating activation of the zygotic genome been identified. Because such regulators must be maternally provided, they are not easily identifiable in genetic screens. On the other hand, the recent technological advances in genomics and bioinformatics may offer alternative strategies for elucidating this mechanism, especially if the identification of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements can be coupled to a biochemical characterization of the factors that bind to them.</p><p>Here we took advantage of the phenotype generated by the removal of specific genes acting during cellularization to identify embryos lacking defined chromosomal arms, and analyzed their expression profiles using microarrays. Because this strategy allows discrimination between transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression, we describe here the first complete analysis of the MZT during animal development.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Time-Course Analysis</title><p>Earlier attempts to identify zygotically active genes in <italic>Drosophila</italic> relied on comparing mRNA levels at cycle 14 with those from unfertilized eggs or early 0&#x02013;1-h-old embryos &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050117-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;. Although zygotic transcription begins already at earlier nuclear cycles (9&#x02013;10), we also started our analysis by focusing on cycle 14 because this stage represents the earliest time point at which the mutant phenotypes associated with the deletion of each specific chromosome can be recognized. The time-course characterization of earlier time points will be presented in the section describing the activation of the zygotic genome. The temporal resolution of our measurements is at 1-h intervals covering the first 3 h of embryogenesis: (1) unfertilized eggs, (2) 0&#x02013;1 h (cycles 1 to 10), (3) 1&#x02013;2 h (cycles 10 to 13), and (4) 2&#x02013;3 h (cycle 14).</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050117-g001">Figure 1</xref>A plots the levels of mRNAs from visually staged 0&#x02013;1-h eggs with those that have developed to cycle 14 (2&#x02013;3 h). In principle, this type of measurement allows identification of the following categories of transcripts: (1) purely zygotic (transcripts that are not expressed at 0&#x02013;1 h and are detected as present at 2&#x02013;3 h), (2) maternal&#x0002b;zygotic (transcripts that are present at 0&#x02013;1 h and whose level increases at 2&#x02013;3 h), and (3) maternal or maternal&#x0002b;zygotic (transcripts that are present at 0&#x02013;1 h and whose level either does not change or decreases in level at 2&#x02013;3 h).</p><p>Transcripts expressed at the same level in both collections lie on the diagonal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050117-g001">Figure 1</xref>). A large fraction of transcripts deviates from the diagonal and are present at increased or decreased levels in cycle 14. Although mRNAs that increase can be most simply explained by new transcription, the existence of mRNAs whose levels go down suggests that post-transcriptional regulation may be too complex to make judgments about the maternal or zygotic source of a transcript based on measured mRNA levels alone. The decrease or stability in the level of mRNAs may reflect a complex balance between activation and degradation. Even the identification of purely zygotic transcripts can be problematic if the designation is based only on measurements at 2&#x02013;3 h being above the background at 0&#x02013;1 h. To address this problem, we undertook a genetic approach based on chromosomal deletions (in embryos that had developed exactly to the same stage) coupled to microarray analysis. We sought to evaluate the traditional interpretation of gene expression measurements, which considers up-regulated transcripts as zygotic, stable transcripts as maternal, and down-regulated transcripts as maternal-degraded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050117-g001">Figure 1</xref>B, model).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Identification of 2L Zygotic Genes</title><p>The left arm of the second chromosome represents approximately 20&#x00025; of the entire genome and is predicted to contain approximately 2,500 open reading frames (BDGP4 annotation; Berkeley <italic>Drosophila</italic> Genome Project, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.fruitfly.org/">http://www.fruitfly.org/</ext-link>). We compared mRNAs from embryos that lack the left arm of the second chromosome with similarly staged wild-type embryos. Such 2L&#x02212; embryos can be recognized by their distinctive halo of lipid-rich cortical cytoplasm during cellularization &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050117-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;, at the precise moment when major zygotic transcription begins. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050117-g001">Figure 1</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050117-g001">1</xref>D plot the result of this experiment.</p><p>Most mRNAs have similar levels in both collections, and lie on a diagonal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050117-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Deviations tend to be located towards the lower left of the diagonal, indicating that certain mRNAs are less abundant in the 2L&#x02212; collection. There is a small number of mRNAs whose level increases when the 2L arm is removed. Altogether these changes can represent direct and/or indirect responses to the ablation of the 2L arm. Although primary responses must involve genes located on 2L, secondary responses are expected to be randomly distributed on the three major chromosomes. We plotted the chromosomal location of down-regulated and up-regulated genes at different cut-offs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050117-g001">Figure 1</xref>E and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050117-g001">1</xref>F). At a stringent fold-change cut-off value of ten, the number of deviant mRNAs is small, and all of them represent mRNAs that are less abundant than in wild type. Approximately 90&#x00025; of these mRNAs are encoded by genes located on 2L, indicating that they are normally supplied by zygotic transcription: removal of 2L eliminates the DNA templates for such transcripts, and the transcripts are not made.</p><p>As we decrease the fold-change cut-off, the number of genes that deviate from the diagonal increases. A 2-fold cut-off identifies 378 genes on 2L whose levels depend on the presence of that chromosomal arm in the embryos. A 2-fold difference signifies that at least 50&#x00025; of the total number of transcripts for each of these genes, present at cycle 14, are derived from zygotic rather than maternal transcription. The observation that even at this cut-off, approximately 60&#x00025; of down-regulated genes are located on 2L strongly validates this procedure. Indeed, if the observed changes were due to random fluctuations of mRNA levels, such changes would be distributed over the entire genome, and 20&#x00025; of them would be located on 2L. It should be noted that, in principle, the down-regulated transcripts might also include maternal mRNAs whose stability is regulated by zygotic transcription. However, the enrichment on 2L suggests that this applies to a very small fraction of genes. We therefore classify all down-regulated transcripts (on the deleted arm) as zygotic. The remaining 631 genes that are located on 2L and detected in cycle 14 embryos are not dependent on the presence of the left arm of the second chromosome in the embryo, and must therefore be supplied by maternal transcription. At the 2-fold cut-off, a second class of affected mRNAs appears. These mRNAs are expressed at a higher or lower level than the wild-type controls, and they mapped to other regions of the genome. We interpret these mRNAs as gene products whose levels depend indirectly on the left arm of the second chromosome. We therefore name these genes &#x0201c;secondary targets&#x0201d; of 2L removal. They may be targets of transcription factors encoded on 2L whose expression at cycle 14 depends on the presence of that arm. Alternatively, they might be post-transcriptionally regulated maternal transcripts whose stability or degradation depends on zygotic transcription. In order to discriminate between these mechanisms, we screened the entire genome and determined the maternal and zygotic contribution for each individual gene.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Whole-Genome Identification of Zygotic Genes and Secondary Targets</title><p>Using additional chromosomal rearrangements, we extended the analysis described in detail above for 2L to the rest of the genome, analyzing mRNA populations present in embryos deficient for the X chromosome, the entire second chromosome, or the entire third chromosome. In most cases, hybridizations were performed in quadruplicate using different batches of embryos. Mutant embryos were recognized under a compound microscope based on their specific abnormalities associated with defects in nuclear morphology, in actin-myosin dynamics, and organelle transport: nullo (chromosome X) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050117-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d;, halo (Chromosome 2) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050117-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;, and bottleneck (Chromosome 3) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050117-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;. These three phenotypes appear synchronously as the embryo enters cycle 14, thus allowing a precise staging protocol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050117-g002">Figure 2</xref>A&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050117-g002">2</xref>J). In each case, we were able to identify mRNAs encoded on the deleted chromosome and whose levels depend directly on the presence of that chromosome. These mRNAs thus appear to be predominantly supplied by zygotic transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050117-g002">Figure 2</xref>K). For all subsequent analyses, we defined the class of down-regulated genes to be those genes with a fold-change of at least three and a <italic>p</italic>-value less than 0.001. In this range, between 60&#x00025; to 80&#x00025; of down-regulated genes map to the chromosomes removed. A more stringent cut-off would have increased specificity at the expense of secondary targets. In addition, we have built a simple online database, which provides access to the entire dataset at any (user-specified) fold-change and/or <italic>p</italic>-value cut-off (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rd.plos.org/pbio.0050117">http://rd.plos.org/pbio.0050117</ext-link>).</p><p>A 3-fold cut-off identifies all mRNAs that are at least 67&#x00025; supplied by zygotic transcription at cycle 14. Combining the data from all four manipulations, we estimate that such zygotically active genes represent about 18&#x00025; of the genes detectable at cycle 14, i.e., 1,158 genes distributed on all four chromosomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050117-st001">Table S1</xref>). The remaining mRNA species appear to be supplied predominantly by maternal transcription. When looking at the entire dataset, zygotically active genes appear to be uniformly distributed throughout the genome.</p><p>Each chromosomal manipulation also identified apparent secondary targets that mapped to other chromosomes. Similar to the results obtained from the 2L&#x02212; experiments, levels of such mRNAs deviated at most 2- to 3-fold in either the positive or the negative direction from wild-type (WT) mRNAs. To test whether these genes were in fact transcriptional targets of genes on the removed chromosome, we asked whether third chromosomal or X chromosomal genes identified in the 2L chromosomal screen as secondary targets behaved as primary targets when the third chromosome or X was removed. This was true for 62&#x00025; of down-regulated and 29&#x00025; of up-regulated genes. Our four experiments identified a total number of 778 secondary targets of which only 28&#x00025; are zygotic (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050117-st002">Table S2</xref>). The remaining 72&#x00025; (563) are mostly maternally supplied. We conclude from these observations that the expression level of most zygotically active genes was not influenced by other loci, and changed significantly only when the chromosome encoding them was removed.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Maternal Transcripts and Degradation</title><p>The identification of 563 non-zygotic mRNAs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050117-st003">Table S3</xref>) whose level changed in response to the removal of a specific chromosome must represent post-transcriptional regulation of maternal transcripts. The stability or degradation of these transcripts may be regulated by transcription of certain factors (coding for RNA-binding proteins or regulatory RNAs) on the chromosomes that are removed. In agreement with this interpretation is the observation that ablation of each chromosome or chromosomal arm results in the misregulation of distinct targets. Thus, transcription at multiple loci regulates the stability of distinct maternal transcripts. For example, the degradation of String and Twine, two cell cycle regulators involved in timing the MZT &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050117-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;, is regulated by zygotic transcription on the X and second chromosomes, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050117-st002">Table S2</xref>).</p><p>Next, we characterized the relative contribution of maternal transcripts to the total cycle 14 expression level of zygotically active genes. We compared the mRNA levels of 1,158 zygotic genes at 0&#x02013;1 h with that observed at 2&#x02013;3 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050117-g003">Figure 3</xref>A). In one third of the cases, transcripts could not be detected in 0&#x02013;1-h embryos, and increased over the 2-h period that follows fertilization. Expression of these genes is therefore purely zygotic: all transcripts detected at cycle 14 are produced by transcription in the embryo itself (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050117-st004">Table S4</xref>). Almost all of these transcripts (~90&#x00025;, 300 out of 334) would have been detected as purely zygotic using the simple criterion &#x0201c;absent at 0&#x02013;1 h&#x02013;present at 2&#x02013;3 h&#x0201d; (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050117-st005">Table S5</xref>). On the other hand, if only this latter criterion had been used, an additional 268 genes would be scored as purely zygotic, even though the level of these transcripts does not change significantly when the chromosome harboring them is removed. When used on its own, the &#x0201c;absent-present&#x0201d; filter may be unreliable because it identifies zygotically active genes by comparing expression measurements at one stage with background levels at another. Our double-filter approach (change in response to the deletion of the DNA template &#x0002b; a &#x0201c;present-absent&#x0201d; value) yields a more stringent and accurate estimate of purely zygotic transcripts.</p><p>The remaining two thirds of the 1,158 zygotic genes were present in unfertilized eggs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050117-st006">Table S6</xref>). Because the overall levels of theses mRNAs either did not change significantly or decreased between 0 h and 3 h, the dependence of cycle 14 levels on zygotic transcription implies the specific degradation of maternal transcripts before that time. Thus, we conclude that an increase in gene expression over time is not a sufficient criterion to identify zygotic genes.</p><p>To follow the stability of maternal transcripts (which is obscured by the presence of newly supplied zygotic transcripts in WT embryos), we compared mRNA levels from early 0&#x02013;1-h embryos (WT) with mRNA levels from embryos missing each chromosome, hand-selected from the same stock during cycle 14. The initial analysis was restricted to genes on the left arm of the second chromosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050117-g003">Figure 3</xref>B); therefore, all 2L mRNAs detected at either stage must be supplied maternally. The relative change in expression levels between 0&#x02013;1 h and 2&#x02013;3 h provides a measure of their stability during that period. Consistent with their strictly maternal source, none of the 1,009 transcripts from 2L increased significantly between 0 h and 3 h. Approximately 65&#x00025; remained constant, and 35&#x00025; dropped more than 3-fold. We extended this analysis to the rest of the genome and estimated that of 6,485 total maternally supplied genes, 2,110 (33&#x00025;) go down significantly by cycle 14. In 646 cases, the maternal degradation was at least in part compensated by zygotic transcription (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050117-st007">Table S7</xref>). A representative list of maternal and zygotic transcripts known to be degraded or induced during the MZT and detected by our analysis is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050117-t001">Table 1</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Zygotic Transcription Generates Restricted Pattern of Gene Expression</title><p>One third of the zygotic transcripts we have identified are not expressed maternally and can be considered purely zygotic genes. These genes are enriched for transcription factors (&#x0201c;transcription factor activity&#x0201d; Gene Ontology (GO) category, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 10<sup>&#x02212;9</sup>). This may reflect the necessity of timing the activity of genes regulating the establishment of cell identity during differentiation. The remaining two thirds, those with maternal contribution, are not significantly enriched in any specific functional class. This raises the question as to why the embryo transcribes genes when the corresponding maternal transcripts are present. Two possible scenarios can be envisaged: (1) maternal transcripts must also be supplied by zygotic transcription, because they are degraded very quickly (i.e., they have short half-lives), and (2) zygotic transcription offers some advantages, such as precise spatial patterning, differential processing (e.g., splice variants), or intracellular localization. In the latter scenario, maternal mRNAs would be specifically degraded to ensure that zygotic transcripts are the only source of these genes at cycle 14.</p><p>Using data downloaded from the BDGP in situ database, we asked whether the zygotic genes we have identified are expressed in specific patterns at cycle 14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050117-g003">Figure 3</xref>D). A total of 241 of the genes we found to be zygotic are annotated in the database. Of those, 59&#x00025; were expressed in discrete patterns at cycle 14. Among the total number of genes in the database (1,227), only 27&#x00025; were patterned at cycle 14. Thus, the zygotic genes we identified are enriched more than 2-fold (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 10<sup>&#x02212;32</sup>) in patterned expression compared to what would be expected by chance. Even among the 143 zygotic genes that initially had uniform maternal component, 29&#x00025; evolved to patterned expression by cycle 14, a situation occurring for only 11&#x00025; of the genes in the entire in situ database (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 10<sup>&#x02212;8</sup>). Because the expression level of these genes was either stable or decreased during the MZT, we conclude that coupling maternal degradation with zygotic transcription is part of the patterning mechanism. Indeed, one third of the genes expressed in patterns at cycle 14 required both zygotic transcription and degradation of uniform maternal mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050117-g003">Figure 3</xref>D).</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Down-Regulated Maternal Genes and Zygotic Genes Share Distinct Common Motifs</title><p>We then asked whether the different categories defined above share common genomic regulatory elements, which could explain the behavior of an individual gene during the MZT.</p><p>We first investigated whether down-regulated maternal genes have over-represented motifs in their 3&#x02032; UTRs. A total of 1,095 maternal genes with annotated 3&#x02032; UTRs decreased in levels significantly between 0&#x02013;1 h and 2&#x02013;3 h. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050117-g003">Figure 3</xref>C, we found several short sequences that are significantly enriched within these 3&#x02032; UTRs, compared to the entire set of annotated 3&#x02032; UTRs. None of them matched the 5&#x02032; extremity of any of the 78 known microRNAs (miRNAs) in <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. melanogaster</named-content>. A similar conclusion was drawn also by studying transcript stability in unfertilized eggs &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050117-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;. The sequences we found can be divided into two families, based on sequence similarity. The first family contains a UUGUU core, which resembles the target site for the PUF family of RNA-binding proteins (whose unique representative in the <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. melanogaster</named-content> genome is Pumilio). To further investigate the role of Pumilio in maternal mRNA degradation, we compared our down-regulated maternal genes to the list of 135 targets of Pumilio in fly embryos &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050117-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;. Although these targets do not all contain exactly the same sequence, 118 of the 135 target genes were identified as maternal in our experiments, and 63 of these (53&#x00025;) were also down-regulated between 0&#x02013;1 h and 2&#x02013;3 h. On the other hand, only 23&#x00025; of maternal genes decreased globally. Therefore, Pumilio targets are very significantly over-represented in maternal down-regulated genes (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 10<sup>&#x02212;12</sup>). Sequences from the second family match the AU-rich element (canonically defined as UAUUUAU), a known mediator of mRNA degradation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050117-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;. Interestingly, an RNA interference (RNAi)-based screen performed in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells has suggested that several components of the miRNA processing pathway are required for degradation of AU-rich element&#x02013;containing mRNAs &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050117-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>We then investigated whether the zygotic transcripts share common DNA regulatory motifs in their upstream regions. We identified a highly over-represented 7-nucleotide&#x02013;long sequence (CAGGTAG, which from now on we will refer to as the 7mer) and several of its variants within the 2 kilobase (kb) upstream regions of purely zygotic genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050117-g003">Figure 3</xref>C).

A more recent study identified this motif upstream of other genes expressed prior to cycle 14, thus suggesting a more general regulatory function &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050117-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>CAGGTAG and the Activation of the Zygotic Genome</title><p>The results described above are intriguing because the 7mer we found is present upstream of only a fraction of the zygotic genes at cycle 14. Although the major activation of the zygotic genome occurs at cycle 14, earlier reports indicated signs of zygotic transcription as early as cycle 10 when the embryonic DNA is still engaged in fast cycles of S-phases and mitoses without interphases &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050117-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d;. We therefore asked whether the 7mer represents a general feature of genes expressed prior to cycle 14 and, in general, whether the zygotic genes we have identified are transcribed altogether during cycle 10 or whether different classes of transcripts respond differently to the embryonic cycles and DNA content.</p><p>We compared the expression profile of unfertilized eggs, 0&#x02013;1-h freshly fertilized eggs (pre-pole cell formation, cycles 1&#x02013;9) and 1&#x02013;2-h embryos (post-pole cell formation and pre-cellularization, cycles 10&#x02013;13). No significant change in expression levels was observed between unfertilized eggs and the 0&#x02013;1-h eggs, indicating that neither transcription nor degradation has occurred (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050117-sg002">Figure S2</xref>). Importantly, in these experiments, we analyzed unfertilized eggs that had been aged for 1 h at most. Therefore, our results do not contradict previous reports describing the degradation of a subset of maternal transcripts in unfertilized eggs &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050117-b017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050117-b024">24</xref>&#x0005d; since, in those studies, unfertilized eggs were aged for longer periods of time, and degradation was observed after 2 h, peaking between 2 and 4 h.</p><p>Between the 0&#x02013;1-h to 1&#x02013;2-h collections, a single group of 59 genes was significantly up-regulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050117-g004">Figure 4</xref>A). These genes (including <italic>Snail, Zen,</italic> and <italic>Nullo,</italic> see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050117-st008">Table S8</xref> for a complete list) are expressed even prior to the gap and pair-rule genes, which in our measurements do not yet show significant increased levels at this time point. Expression of gap and pair-rule transcripts was detected at 2&#x02013;3 h (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050117-st001">Table S1</xref>), arguing that their transcripts accumulate with a slower kinetic. When searching for over-represented motifs in the 2-kb upstream regions of these genes, we found the same motif as for the pure zygotic genes, along with other overlapping or slightly distinct variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050117-g004">Figure 4</xref>B). We found 91.5&#x00025; of the 59 genes have at least one copy of any of these variants, whereas the expectation based on all genes in the genome is 40&#x00025; (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 10<sup>&#x02212;15</sup>). Moreover, 28.8&#x00025; of the 59 genes have four or more non-overlapping copies of these sequences, a situation occurring for only 1.6&#x00025; of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genes (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 10<sup>&#x02212;16</sup>). Thus we conclude that the activation of the zygotic genome starts from genes containing this motif. Interestingly, the occurrences of the 7mer within the 2-kb upstream regions tend to be much closer to the transcription start site than expected by chance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050117-g004">Figure 4</xref>C). Finally, we asked whether these genes share some additional features that increase the overall fitness of gene expression prior to cycle 14. We found that 70&#x00025; of these genes do not contain introns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050117-g004">Figure 4</xref>A). Since intronless genes represent only 20&#x00025; of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome, this result suggests an important selective advantage for the transcription of intronless genes in concomitance with fast-cycling nuclei.</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Biochemical Purification of Bicoid Stability Factor as the 7mer Binding Protein</title><p>The identification of a single highly over-represented <italic>cis</italic>-element in the 5&#x02032; region of the early zygotic genes suggests the existence of a single <italic>trans</italic>-acting factor involved in timing the activation of the zygotic genome. If such a factor exists, it is most likely maternally provided and loaded into the egg during oogenesis. To identify this factor, we undertook a biochemical approach. We performed sequential DNA affinity chromatography (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> for details) using the 7mer or, as negative control, the upstream activation sequence (UAS) (the consensus binding site of the yeast <italic>trans</italic>-activator GAL4). The result of this experiment is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050117-g005">Figure 5</xref>A. Only one band was detected in the 7mer elute, and no specific band was detected in the UAS control elute. Mass spectrometry sequencing identified this protein as the Bicoid stability factor (BSF), and Western blotting analysis confirmed this result (unpublished data).</p><p>BSF has been previously identified as a Bicoid mRNA binding protein involved in regulating the stability of Bicoid transcripts during oogenesis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050117-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d;. Our data suggest an additional transcriptional function for BSF in the embryo, and indeed, the human homolog of BSF has been shown to function as a transcriptional regulator &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050117-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>In order to address the specificity of the 7mer/BSF interaction, BSF was expressed in rabbit reticulocyte in the presence of <sup>35</sup>S methionine, and the binding to the 7mer or to a mutated oligo (in which the two GG at position 3 and 4 were mutated to TT) was tested. In vitro&#x02013;synthesized BSF bound directly and specifically to the 7mer, and only background signal was retained on the beads coupled to the mutated oligo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050117-g005">Figure 5</xref>B).</p><p>Next, we analyzed the subcellular distribution of BSF in the embryo using immunostaining and confocal microscopy imaging. BSF was localized to both the cytoplasm as well as the nuclei of the blastoderm epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050117-g005">Figure 5</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050117-g005">5</xref>D). In the germ cells (pole cells), which at this stage are transcriptionally silent, BSF was retained in cytoplasmic puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050117-g005">Figure 5</xref>E and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050117-g005">5</xref>F). Thus, BSF is differentially compartmentalized between the soma and the germ line, and this compartmentalization may be important to maintain the transcriptional quiescence in the germline.</p><p>To test the function of BSF in the early embryo, it is necessary to remove the maternal contribution. (BSF transcripts are maternally provided and the protein is expressed during oogenesis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050117-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d;.) To perform this experiment, we produced germline clones using a P element insertion that maps in the BSF open reading frame and is homozygous lethal. Flies containing such clones failed to lay eggs, and the ovaries were arrested at a very early stage of development, indicating that BSF is required also during oogenesis. This made it impossible to test the function of BSF in the early embryo. Therefore, we took an alternative approach with the aim to functionally characterize the activity of the 7mer. We considered two possible scenarios. One possibility is that the 7mer may have enhancer activity, sufficient to drive transcription on its own. Alternatively, it may play a permissive role by functioning in a combinatorial fashion with additional factors. To discriminate between these two possibilities, we set up conditions to measure gene expression using an assay based on the UAS/GAL4 system &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050117-b027">27</xref>&#x0005d;.</p></sec><sec id="s2i"><title>CAGGTAG Activates Transcription Prior to Cycle 14</title><p>We generated embryos expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) under the control of the UAS&#x02013;heat shock minimal promoter either with or without five copies of the 7mer, and followed GFP expression using video microscopy. GFP was not detected in embryos unless GAL4 was also provided. Strikingly, the presence of the 7mer led to a more than 4-fold increase in the expression of GFP compared to controls (transgene without the 7mer), as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050117-g006">Figure 6</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050117-g006">6</xref>B.</p><p>Next, we asked how early this stimulatory activity could be detected.

This technology allows the visualization of nascent transcripts as they arise from the site of transcription &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050117-b028">28</xref>&#x0005d;. Because we crossed males carrying the GFP transgene to females providing GAL4, only one chromosome in the embryo is expected to transcribe GFP. In agreement with this prediction, we detected only one major transcription focus, appearing as an individual dot, per nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050117-g006">Figure 6</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050117-g006">6</xref>D). We observed an increase in the number and size of dots at each nuclear division when the 7mer was present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050117-g006">Figure 6</xref>D). This difference could be detected as early as cycle 11 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050117-sg001">Figure S1</xref>). By cycle 14, images are characterized by a high signal-to-noise ratio and showed an approximately 1.7-fold increase in the number of dots per embryo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050117-g006">Figure 6</xref>E). Thus, the presence of CAGGTAG increases the number of nuclei that are actually engaged in transcription. Because the size of each dot is also larger (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050117-g006">Figure 6</xref>F), each dot most likely contains more transcripts. If this interpretation is correct, then it should be possible to quantify this difference by measuring the total amount of GFP transcripts.</p><p>Embryos were harvested either at the stage when the earliest GFP transcripts were expressed (cycle 10 to 13) or at cycle 14. Total RNA was extracted and subjected to reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050117-g006">Figure 6</xref>G). As a staging control, we followed the expression of <italic>Snail,</italic> a known zygotic gene. We detected 7mer-driven transcription as early as cycle 12. In the absence of this motif, no GFP expression was detected. By cycle 14, we observed a 2-fold increase in GFP expression, which is in agreement with the FISH quantification. As a control, we also followed <italic>Snail</italic> mRNA, which was expressed at similar levels in both conditions, and its expression increased from cycle 12 to 14. Altogether, these results show that the CAGGTAG motif functions as an enhancer that cannot drive transcription on its own (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050117-g006">Figure 6</xref>C), but can activate expression prior to cycle 14, in combination with a transcriptional activator. In agreement with this result is the finding that CAGGTAG and its variants are particularly abundant in enhancer sequences bound by Dorsal and Bicoid (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050117-st009">Table S9</xref>), thus suggesting a combinatorial regulatory mode (see model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050117-g007">Figure 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Discussion</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>The switch from maternal to zygotic control of early embryonic development is characterized by a dramatic remodeling of the transcriptional complexity present in the oocyte. We have genetically identified the relative maternal and zygotic contribution for the expression of each individual gene during the <named-content content-type="genus-species">D. melanogaster</named-content> mid-blastula transition. The criterion we used to identify zygotically expressed genes is strictly based on the direct relationship between the DNA template and the corresponding transcript. The specific phenotype generated upon removal of each chromosomal arm allowed us to collect a synchronous population of embryos just at the stage when the first morphological signs of the zygotic genome become visible. The location of the majority of down-regulated genes to the chromosomal arm that was ablated provided an excellent control for the entire experimental procedure we have undertaken.</p><p>In summary, our results indicate that zygotic transcription contributes to approximately 20&#x00025; of the genes expressed at cycle 14, and as much as 30&#x00025; of maternal transcripts become unstable during the mid-blastula transition. However, about a third of these transcripts are also supplied by zygotic transcription and, therefore, their expression levels at cycle 14 remain constant. Purely zygotic transcripts represent only a third of the total set of zygotically expressed genes. The remaining two thirds also had a maternal contribution and were present in unfertilized or 0&#x02013;1-h eggs. The zygotic transcription of such maternally provided genes does not always result in an increase in the total amount of transcript, indicating specific degradation of the maternal counterpart. Thus, a change in gene expression over time is not a sufficient criterion to identify zygotically active genes, nor to measure the stability of maternal transcripts. These results have important implications for the definition of maternal and zygotic genes, and provide a genome-wide analysis, which will be instrumental for a molecular characterization of the MZT.</p><p>Our analysis shows that purely zygotic transcripts are enriched in transcription factors. Providing these genes through zygotic transcription, which in turn is related to the number of nuclei, ensures that correct number of cells is assigned to a specific fate and, ultimately, the establishment of the correct body proportion. The execution of a specific differentiation program represents a more complex problem, in that it involves the adjustment of the expression of genes involved in basic cell function. Therefore, these genes must be expressed during oogenesis, to support oocyte development, and their activity modulated through zygotic transcription.</p><p>Our data argue that zygotic transcription allows a large fraction of ubiquitously expressed maternal mRNAs to be expressed again in localized patterns at the blastoderm stage. The generation of these patterns involves the degradation of the maternal transcript and the corresponding activation of zygotic transcription. This result is in agreement with previous studies on individual genes (e.g., the maternally provided Cdc25 phosphatase string and the maternal-zygotic transcription factor hunchback), which were reported to undergo a similar MZT &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050117-b029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050117-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d;. Altogether our analysis is consistent with the proposal that zygotic transcription provides the spatial precision at which important regulatory genes must be expressed during the differentiation of the developing embryo. Therefore, our results can be used in combination with chromosomal deficiency screening to quickly identify gene function at the mid-blastula transition by reducing the number of candidate genes contained in each deficiency to zygotic-dependent expressed genes. We have used this approach to identify the bearded genes as the zygotic genes regulating Notch signaling during mesoectoderm specification &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050117-b031">31</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>In addition, our results show that zygotic transcription is required for the degradation of a distinct subset of maternal transcripts. Because these transcripts do not share any statistically enriched common regulatory sequence and because each chromosomal manipulation targeted distinct transcripts, we propose that multiple zygotic activities must be involved in this regulation. One possibility is that the zygotic expression of miRNAs might be part of this mechanism. For example, in zebrafish, mir-430 was shown to control the degradation of a pool of maternal transcripts &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050117-b032">32</xref>&#x0005d;. Although we have not detected any significant over-representation of known miRNA target sites in our data, the involvement of miRNAs in specific pathways can be tested once zygotic control regions have been more closely defined. We also identified maternal mRNAs that are degraded and not replenished by zygotic transcription. A fraction of these genes share sequences within their 3&#x02032; UTR, which resemble the known target site for the Pumilio RNA-binding protein. We showed that a very large fraction of the Pumilio targets in the embryo are indeed degraded during the transition from maternal to zygotic stages. Pumilio was first identified as an inhibitor of translation controlling posterior fate by promoting deadenylation of hunchback mRNA &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050117-b033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050117-b034">34</xref>&#x0005d;.

We have identified the CAGGTAG motif (and its variants) as an important player in this transition. We identified the BSF as the factor binding to this motif in the early embryo.</p><p>BSF has been previously identified as a protein binding to the 3&#x02032; UTR of Bicoid mRNA and involved in regulating Bicoid transcript stability during oogenesis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050117-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d;. However, the precise biochemical function of BSF is unknown. Mutation of this gene causes lethality, and induction of homozygous germline clones arrests oogenesis (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Results</xref>). Thus, BSF must have additional function other than the regulation of Bicoid transcripts because Bicoid itself is not required for oogenesis, and zygotic mutants are viable.</p><p>Interestingly, the human ortholog of BSF, the leucine-rich protein LRP130, has been shown to bind to a <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory sequence in the 5&#x02032; proximal region of the MDR1 gene and to act as a transcriptional regulator &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050117-b026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050117-b036">36</xref>&#x0005d;. Although we could not genetically test the function of BSF, our analysis suggests that BSF is not able to drive transcription on its own, but must act in a combinatorial fashion. Indeed, we found that CAGGTAG and its variants are particularly abundant in enhancer sequences bound by Dorsal and Bicoid (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050117-st009">Table S9</xref>). These transcription factors activate the expression of their target genes in a concentration-dependent manner and define distinct developmental units along the dorsal-ventral (D-V) and anterior-posterior (A-P) axes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050117-b037">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050117-b038">38</xref>&#x0005d;. Interestingly, only a subset of the known targets for these transcription factors have this element, even within the same spatial unit. For example, in the D-V patterning system controlled by the Dorsal gradient, CAGGTAG is found in <italic>Snail</italic> and <italic>Tom,</italic> but not <italic>Neuralized</italic>. Both <italic>Snail</italic> and <italic>Tom</italic> are expressed prior to <italic>Neuralized</italic> (<italic>Snail</italic> and <italic>Tom</italic> are among the 59 genes induced during cycle 10&#x02013;11) and must act before <italic>Neuralized</italic> to precisely position Notch signaling at the mesoderm&#x02013;mesoectoderm boundary &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050117-b031">31</xref>&#x0005d;. The inability of CAGGTAG to drive transcription on its own makes it an ideal timer, which links spatial gradient with temporal regulation (see model, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050117-g007">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, the experiments described in this work will be instrumental for studying the activation of the zygotic genome in other animals and for guiding embryonic stem cell differentiation. In the mouse, zygotic transcription begins by the two-cell stage, and a large number of maternal mRNAs persist beyond this stage &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050117-b004">4</xref>&#x0005d;. The contribution of zygotic transcription to the expression of these mRNAs is still unknown. Further, the activation of the mouse genome is characterized by discrete wave-like patterns of gene expression. Similarly, the activation of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome starts with a battery of 59 transcripts induced from cycles 10&#x02013;11 to cycle 14. Interestingly, 70&#x00025; of these genes do not contain introns, and they all encode small proteins. This result is in agreement with two previous studies showing that genes transcribed early in development tend to be unusually short &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050117-b039">39</xref>&#x0005d; and that the presence of a long intron (19 kb) limits the expression of the <italic>knirps</italic>-related gene <italic>(knrl)</italic> early during <italic>Drosophila</italic> development &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050117-b040">40</xref>&#x0005d;. The use of intronless genes might reflect the necessity of expressing regulatory genes requiring a minimal response time.

A BSF polyclonal antibody was used to detect the endogenous localization of BSF. BSF was localized to both the cytoplasm and nuclei (arrowheads in &#x0005b;C&#x0005d; and &#x0005b;D&#x0005d;) of the blastoderm epithelium. In pole cells, BSF was localized to cytoplasmic structures, which appeared as dots, arrowhead (F). The arrow in (C) indicates the region which is enlarged in (E). The asterisk (&#x0002a;) in (C) indicate the region which is enlarged in (D).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pbio.0050117.g005"/></fig><fig id="pbio-0050117-g006" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>The CAGGTAG Motif Activates Transcription prior to Cycle 14</title><p>(A) Transgenic embryos over-expressing GFP with (7mer) or without (control) the 7mer.

Gene <italic>a,</italic> whose enhancer has the lower affinity for this particular morphogen, is expressed only at the higher concentration of the gradient. Gene <italic>d,</italic> whose enhancer has the higher affinity, is expressed also at a lower concentration. The 7mer sequence can time the response to this gradient while maintaining the spatial information. Because the 7-mer alone is not able to activate transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050117-g006">Figure 6</xref>), it can function as a timer linking the spatial gradient with the temporal regulation. For example, the 7mer sequence contained in the 5&#x02032; regulatory region of gene <italic>a</italic> would allow gene <italic>a</italic> to be expressed before gene <italic>e</italic> within the same spatial unit (red). This regulatory mode can operate along both the dorsal-ventral (D-V) and anterior-posterior (A-P) axes because it would not interfere with the positional information encoded in the gradient itself. Indeed the 7mer and its variants are particularly enriched in enhancers bound by Dorsal (D-V) and Bicoid (A-P).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pbio.0050117.g007"/></fig><table-wrap id="pbio-0050117-t001" content-type="1col" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Expression Profile of Known Maternal and Zygotic Genes</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pbio.0050117.t001"/></table-wrap></sec><fn-group><fn id="ack1" fn-type="con"><p><bold>Author contributions.</bold> SDR and EFW conceived and designed the experiments.
