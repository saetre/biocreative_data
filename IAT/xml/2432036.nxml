While ER&#x003b1; seems to have a protective role in such diseases, the function of ER&#x003b2; is not clear. To characterize the metabolic function of ER&#x003b2;, we investigated its molecular interaction with a master regulator of insulin signaling/glucose metabolism, the PPAR&#x003b3;, in vitro and in high-fat diet (HFD)-fed ER&#x003b2; -/- mice (&#x003b2;ERKO) mice. Our in vitro experiments showed that ER&#x003b2; inhibits ligand-mediated PPAR&#x003b3;-transcriptional activity. That resulted in a blockade of PPAR&#x003b3;-induced adipocytic gene expression and in decreased adipogenesis. Overexpression of nuclear coactivators such as SRC1 and TIF2 prevented the ER&#x003b2;-mediated inhibition of PPAR&#x003b3; activity. Consistent with the in vitro data, we observed increased PPAR&#x003b3; activity in gonadal fat from HFD-fed &#x003b2;ERKO mice. In consonance with enhanced PPAR&#x003b3; activation, HFD-fed &#x003b2;ERKO mice showed increased body weight gain and fat mass in the presence of improved insulin sensitivity. To directly demonstrate the role of PPAR&#x003b3; in HFD-fed &#x003b2;ERKO mice, PPAR&#x003b3; signaling was disrupted by PPAR&#x003b3; antisense oligonucleotide (ASO). Blockade of adipose PPAR&#x003b3; by ASO reversed the phenotype of &#x003b2;ERKO mice with an impairment of insulin sensitization and glucose tolerance. Finally, binding of SRC1 and TIF2 to the PPAR&#x003b3;-regulated adiponectin promoter was enhanced in gonadal fat from &#x003b2;ERKO mice indicating that the absence of ER&#x003b2; in adipose tissue results in exaggerated coactivator binding to a PPAR&#x003b3; target promoter. Collectively, our data provide the first evidence that ER&#x003b2;-deficiency protects against diet-induced IR and glucose intolerance which involves an augmented PPAR&#x003b3; signaling in adipose tissue. Moreover, our data suggest that the coactivators SRC1 and TIF2 are involved in this interaction. Impairment of insulin and glucose metabolism by ER&#x003b2; may have significant implications for our understanding of hormone receptor-dependent pathophysiology of metabolic diseases, and may be essential for the development of new ER&#x003b2;-selective agonists.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>In the present study, we demonstrate for the first time a pro-diabetogenic function of the ER&#x003b2;. Our experiments indicate that ER&#x003b2; impairs insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance in mice challenged with a high fat diet (HFD). Loss of ER&#x003b2;, studied in ER&#x003b2; -/- mice (&#x003b2;ERKO mice), results in increased body weight gain and fat deposition under HFD-treatment. Conversely, absence of ER&#x003b2; averted accumulation of triglycerides and preserved regular insulin signaling in liver and skeletal muscle. This observation was associated with improved whole-body insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance. Increased adipose tissue mass in the presence of improved insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance is usually observed under chronic stimulation of the nuclear hormone receptor PPAR&#x003b3;. In consonance, we show that activation of PPAR&#x003b3; was markedly induced in gonadal fat from &#x003b2;ERKO mice and blockade of adipose PPAR&#x003b3; signaling by antisense oligonucleotide injection reversed the metabolic phenotype. Moreover, our cell culture experiments indicate that ER&#x003b2; is a negative regulator of ligand-induced PPAR&#x003b3; activity in vitro. Finally, we identify SRC1 and TIF2 as key players in the ER&#x003b2;-PPAR&#x003b3; interaction. In summary, the present study demonstrates that ER&#x003b2; impairs insulin and glucose metabolism, which may, at least in part, result from a negative cross-talk with adipose PPAR&#x003b3;.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="16"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The estrogen receptors (ERs) are members of the nuclear hormone receptor family (NHR) which act as eukaryotic ligand-dependent transcription factors.

Consequently, data from &#x003b2;ERKO mice suggest that ER&#x003b2; negatively regulates insulin and glucose metabolism which may, at least in part, result from an impairment of regular adipose tissue function based on a negative cross-talk between ER&#x003b2; and PPAR&#x003b3;. Loss of ER&#x003b2; resulted in enhanced body weight gain and fat accumulation in HFD-fed mice. However, absence of ER&#x003b2; prevented hepatic/ muscular triglyceride overload, preserved regular insulin signaling in liver/ skeletal muscle, and improved whole-body insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance under HFD. This metabolic phenotype strongly suggested augmented PPAR&#x003b3; signaling in mice lacking ER&#x003b2;. And indeed, PPAR&#x003b3; target genes and PPAR&#x003b3;-DNA binding were markedly induced in gonadal fat from &#x003b2;ERKO mice. Along this line, blockade of adipose PPAR&#x003b3; signaling by PPAR&#x003b3; ASO injection reversed the metabolic changes in &#x003b2;ERKO mice.</p><p>A mutual signaling cross-talk between ERs and PPAR&#x003b3; has been described previously. PPAR&#x003b3; together with its heterodimeric partner RXR&#x003b1; has been shown to suppress ER-induced target gene expression through competitive binding to an ERE site in the vitellogenin A2 promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000108-Keller1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. In accordance with a bidirectional interaction, Wang and colleagues demonstrated that ERs are capable of inhibiting ligand-induced PPAR&#x003b3; activation in two different breast cancer cell lines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000108-Wang1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. In contrast to our results, these authors show that basal and agonist-stimulated PPRE-activity is also blocked by ER&#x003b1;. Transcriptional activity of PPAR&#x003b3; differs markedly depending on the cell system and tissues. The highest level of PPAR&#x003b3;-mediated transcription has been described in adipocytes and adipocytic cell lines, where molecular conditions such as cofactor availability seemed to be optimized <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000108-Tontonoz2">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. Compared to adipocytes, breast cancer cells exhibit low PPAR&#x003b3; expression and activity reflected by a less than 2-fold induction of PPRE-activity after ligand stimulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000108-Wang1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. The presence of PPAR&#x003b3; suppression by ER&#x003b1; in breast cancer cells might be a result of weak basal PPAR&#x003b3; transcriptional activity in these cells. In contrast, the pronounced activation of the exogenous PPAR&#x003b3; LBD in 3T3-L1 preadipocytes may require more potent inhibitory stimuli which could not be achieved by ER&#x003b1; overexpression in our system.</p><p>Suppression of PPAR&#x003b3;-LBD activation by ER&#x003b2; did not depend on ER&#x003b2; ligands which is consistent with previous reports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000108-Wang1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. Also our in vivo studies in estrogen-depleted, ovariectomized wt mice treated with the ER&#x003b2;-ligand DPN indicate that PPAR&#x003b3;-ER&#x003b2; interaction is ligand independent. More importantly, overexpression of a truncated form of ER&#x003b2; containing solely the ER&#x003b2;-LBD/ AF2 domain did not induce any inhibitory effect on PPAR&#x003b3; suggesting an important role of ER&#x003b2;'s NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal AF1 domain for ER&#x003b2;-PPAR&#x003b3; interactions.

Furthermore, Tremblay and coworkers demonstrated that ER&#x003b2;-AF1 activation involves ligand-independent recruitment of SRC-1, a cofactor involved in ER&#x003b2;-PPAR&#x003b3; interactions in our study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000108-Tremblay1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. These data corroborate our observation that PPAR&#x003b3; suppression by ER&#x003b2; involves the AF1 domain and ligand-independent interactions with the coactivators SRC1 and TIF2. Repression of PPAR&#x003b3; activity through ER&#x003b2; was reversed by titration of the p160 coactivators, SRC1 and TIF2, suggesting that the suppressive action of ER&#x003b2; is a result of p160 coactivator interaction with ER&#x003b2; thereby preventing the binding of PPAR&#x003b3; to the same coactivators.

GLUT4 has been identified as the major mediator of insulin-induced glucose uptake in fat and skeletal muscle. In addition, removal of the E2-ER&#x003b2; signaling by ovariectomy in ER&#x003b1;-deficient mice improved glucose and insulin metabolism supporting the diabetogenic effect of ER&#x003b2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000108-Naaz1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Loss of ER&#x003b2; resulted in a marked augmentation of adipose PPAR&#x003b3; activity in our model indicating that ER&#x003b2; mediates its metabolic actions by a negative interaction with PPAR&#x003b3; in adipose tissue. This concept is corroborated by a number of observations. HFD-fed &#x003b2;ERKO mice exhibited increased adipose tissue mass in the presence of improved insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance. These metabolic changes are usually observed under chronic PPAR&#x003b3; stimulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000108-Picard1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. PPAR&#x003b3; has been identified as an essential regulator of whole-body insulin sensitivity. Two major mechanisms have been described: (1) Adipose PPAR&#x003b3; protects non-adipose tissue against excessive lipid overload and maintains normal organ function and insulin responses (liver, skeletal muscle) by preserving regular adipose tissue function, and (2) Adipose PPAR&#x003b3; guarantees a balanced and adequate production of adipocytokine secretion such as adiponectin from adipose tissue, factors which are important mediators of insulin action in peripheral tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000108-He1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000108-Zhang2">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. Both processes could be observed in &#x003b2;ERKO mice. Further support of this notion comes from clinical actions of anti-diabetic PPAR&#x003b3; agonists (TZD) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000108-Frias1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000108-Staels1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. Activation of PPAR&#x003b3; by TZDs in diabetic patients resembles the phenotype of &#x003b2;ERKO mice including improved insulin sensitization and glucose tolerance in the presence of weight gain. We also observed increased food efficiency and changes in nutrient partitioning reflected by an increased RQ in &#x003b2;ERKO mice. Loss of ER&#x003b2; appears to result in attenuated fatty acid (FA) oxidation which may favor the storage of TGs in adipose tissue and increased fat accumulation, and may provide a possible explanation for the enhanced weight gain. Interestingly, treatment of obese mice with a synthetic PPAR&#x003b3; agonist has been shown to mediate similar changes including an increase in food efficiency and higher RQ values <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000108-Sell1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. Finally, blockade of PPAR&#x003b3; signaling in adipose tissue of &#x003b2;ERKO mice resulted in a reversal of the metabolic phenotype corroborating the importance of adipose PPAR&#x003b3; in the present model. The observed suppression of hepatic PPAR&#x003b3; activity by ASO injection is unlikely to play a major role since the initial metabolic characterization of untreated &#x003b2;ERKO mice under HFD did not reveal any dysregulation of hepatic PPAR&#x003b3; signaling. In summary, the metabolic phenotype of &#x003b2;ERKO mice is mediated by an augmented adipose PPAR&#x003b3; action, which implies that in the presence of ER&#x003b2;, PPAR&#x003b3; activity might be partially suppressed.</p><p>The notion, that ER&#x003b2;-PPAR&#x003b3; crosstalk requires receptor-p160 interaction, was underlined by our observations in WAT from &#x003b2;ERKO mice. Binding of SRC1 and TIF2 to the PPAR&#x003b3;-regulated adiponectin promoter in WAT was enhanced in the absence of ER&#x003b2;. It has recently been demonstrated that p160 coactivators are important regulators of PPAR&#x003b3; transcriptional activity in WAT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000108-Picard2">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. In particular, TIF2 has been identified as a nuclear coactivator involved in the adipogenic actions of PPAR&#x003b3;. Future experiments are required to define the functional relevance of TIF2 and SRC1 in our model. So far one may conclude that the metabolic phenotype of HFD-fed &#x003b2;ERKO mice is, at least in part, explained by increased adipose PPAR&#x003b3; activity as a result of exaggerated binding of p160 coactivators to PPAR&#x003b3;-regulated target gene promoters. Diabetogenic actions of ER&#x003b2; are of major significance for the pharmaceutical development of new ER&#x003b2;-selective agonists intended for use against a multitude of diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis or postmenopausal osteoporosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000108-Follettie1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000108-Komm1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>. Despite the high tissue selectivity of such compounds, and despite the fact that the actions observed in our study were ligand-independent, one has to be aware of the potentially deleterious actions of ER&#x003b2; on insulin- and glucose metabolism. As a precautionary measure metabolic profiling of new ER&#x003b2; agonist should be performed.</p><p>Collectively, our data provide first evidence that ER&#x003b2; negatively regulates insulin signaling and glucose metabolism that involves an impairment of regular adipose PPAR&#x003b3; function. Moreover our data suggest that the coactivators SRC1 and TIF2 are involved in this inhibition. In consonance, impairment of insulin and glucose metabolism by ER&#x003b2; has significant implications for our understanding of hormone receptor-dependent pathophysiology of metabolic diseases, and is essential for the development of new ER&#x003b2;-selective agonists.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Animal Care and Treatment</title><p>Female estrogen receptor &#x003b2; -/- mice (&#x003b2;ERKO) received from J.-A.
