In addition there is increasing evidence for other functions of Notch, particularly in connection with Wnt signalling: Notch is able to modulate the activity of Armadillo/&#x000df;-catenin, the effector of Wnt signalling, in a manner that is independent of its transcriptional activity. Here we explore the mechanism of this interaction in the epithelium of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> imaginal discs and find that it is mediated by the ligand-independent endocytosis and traffic of the Notch receptor. Our results show that Notch associates with Armadillo near the adherens junctions and that it is rapidly endocytosed promoting the traffic of an activated form of Armadillo into endosomal compartments, where it may be degraded. As Notch has the ability to interact with and downregulate activated forms of Armadillo, it is possible that in vivo Notch regulates the transcriptionally competent pool of Armadillo. These interactions reveal a previously unknown activity of Notch, which serves to buffer the function of activated Armadillo and might underlie some of its transcription-independent effects.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Establishment of the correct shape and pattern of tissues within an organism requires the integration of molecular information present in signalling and transcriptional networks and demands delicate exchanges and balances of their activities. A large body of experimental work has revealed close correlations in the activities of two pathways: Notch and Wnt, which suggest the existence of multiple links between them. Notch signalling relies in part upon the activity of the Notch protein, a membrane-bound receptor with a transcription factor domain that can be released from the membrane by proteolytic cleavage. On the other hand Wnt proteins are ligands that trigger changes in the activity of &#x000df;-catenin, which is called Armadillo in the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. In this study we uncover a previously unknown activity for Notch: endocytosis and trafficking of full length Notch, which targets Armadillo for degradation. This activity of Notch is independent of its ligands, Delta and Serrate, and of its downstream effector, the transcription factor Suppressor of Hairless. We further show that in the absence of Notch, which has been shown to act as a tumor suppressor in mammals, expression of an activated form of Armadillo causes tissue overgrowth and changes in the polarity of cells. Our results suggest that <italic>Drosophila</italic> Notch can promote the degradation of activated forms of Armadillo and may buffer cells against fluctuations in Wnt signalling activity.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="18"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The <italic>Notch</italic> gene of <italic>Drosophila</italic> encodes a member of a family of conserved single transmembrane receptors with key tasks in the information processing activity of animal cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000169-ArtavanisTsakonas1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000169-Schweisguth1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>.

Expression of FLN shows that Notch can recruit Arm to its apical domain and also create a subapical domain where both can be found, sometimes, in vesicles. Arm<sup>S10</sup> displaces endogenous Arm from the adherens junctions into a subapical domain, which is probably due to the increased stability of Arm<sup>S10</sup>. Expression of FLN or CeN together with Arm<sup>S10</sup> leads to changes in the localization of Notch, Arm, and Arm<sup>S10</sup> as shown.

On the other hand, when FLN is overexpressed with Arm<sup>S10</sup>, it induces changes in the localization of Arm<sup>S10</sup> and Arm. While it is likely that Notch can interact with all forms of Arm, it is also possible that it interacts preferentially with Arm<sup>S10</sup> and that the effects that we observe on Arm under these conditions are the result of the interactions with Arm<sup>S10</sup>. The observation that in the presence of FLN and Arm<sup>S10</sup>, Arm can be observed at the adherens junctions favours this possibility. NB: Most of the effects that we observe are restricted to the apical and subapical domains of the epithelial cells and it is important to bear in mind that it is not easy to discern much structure in this domain at the level of light microscopy as this appears to be the location of early, mid, late, and recycling endosomes.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pbio.1000169.g009"/></fig><p>The effects of Notch on Arm are mirrored by the effects of Arm on Notch: expression of Arm<sup>S10</sup> induces a delocalization of Notch and CeN from the cell surface into a diffuse subapical domain and a general reduction in the amount of Notch or CeN in the cell (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000169.s013">Figure S13B, S13C, S13B<sub>1</sub>, and S13C<sub>1</sub></xref>).

Since this function of Notch has been established under experimental conditions that require simultaneous loss of function of Notch and gain of function of Armadillo, it is reasonable to ask if it plays a role during normal development. We believe that it does. There is an ample literature of interactions between Notch and Wnt signalling that do not admit simple explanations in terms of their joint transcriptional activities (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000169-Hayward1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>), and which can be accounted for by our findings here.

The context dependence of these observations are likely to reflect tissue-specific inputs of the machinery of traffic on Notch.

Our finding not only provides a mechanism for the interactions between Notch and Wnt signalling but also explains the phenotypic differences associated with the loss of function of Notch and that of its bona fide ligands and effector.

Whatever the nature of these aggregates, this activity of Notch is not restricted to the developing wing as the same effect is observed in all imaginal discs (unpublished data). As on their own neither increased Armadillo activity nor loss of Notch function elicit a similar effect, these cells represent a synthetic phenotype that reveals the physiological potential of these pathways as well as their close interactions.</p><p>The effects of loss of Notch function in the mouse skin and the imaginal discs show that Notch performs an important function as a buffer against fluctuations in the activity of Arm/&#x000df;-catenin, and that as such it plays a role in the homeostasis of the cell. It is likely that the Axin/APC/GSK3-based complex that degrades Armadillo and &#x000df;-catenin is not totally effective and that, even in the absence of Wnt ligands, there are leakages of active Arm/&#x000df;-catenin that result in small bursts of signalling. We surmise that the role of Notch is to interact with the leaked activated Arm/&#x000df;-catenin and to degrade it in order to maintain the levels of spontaneous signalling low, thus providing its buffering function. The existence of complexes between Notch and Armadillo has been reported before <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000169-Hayward2">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000169-Shimizu1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref> and is supported by our observation of their reciprocal change of localization in the overexpression experiments. There is little question that some of these interactions are likely to be associated with the transcriptional activity of both molecules, but our observations that Notch is able to recruit Armadillo to an apical domain, that endocytosed Notch can be found associated with Armadillo and that Arm<sup>S10</sup> is stabilized in the absence of Notch, provide evidence for another level of interaction that is likely to be the basis for its buffering activity. This function might be associated with features of tumour suppressors as it would provide the mechanism to cope with transient high fluctuations in the amount or activity of oncogenes. It also raises the possibility of an association between the levels of Notch and the oncogenicity of &#x000df;-catenin, i.e., there might be a tissue specific traffic of Notch that determines its tumour sensitivity.</p><p>Our observations also have implications for the mechanism of activation of Arm/&#x000df;-catenin. There is evidence for distinct pools of Arm/&#x000df;-catenin involved in signalling and adhesion and, although it is generally accepted that the signalling pool is associated with a cytoplasmic soluble pool, a number of experiments cast doubts on this simple relationship <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000169-Gottardi1">&#x0005b;74&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000169-Tolwinski3">&#x0005b;79&#x0005d;</xref>. Our results support the existence of an active pool of Arm/&#x000df;-catenin that, in epithelial cells, exists at or near the adherens junctions, and that it is this pool, rather than the general GSK3-sensitive pool, that is the target of Notch (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000169-Hayward2">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>). A GSK3-insensitive pool subject to further regulation by Axin has been suggested as the source of active Armadillo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000169-Tolwinski1">&#x0005b;67&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000169-Tolwinski3">&#x0005b;79&#x0005d;</xref>, and interactions have been described between Axin and Notch in the regulation of Armadillo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000169-Hayward3">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>. It might be that this pool corresponds to the membrane-associated pool that we identify here and that rather than a putative cytosolic pool, it is this pool that contains the transcriptionally competent Arm/&#x000df;-catenin. On the basis of these observations we surmise that, in the absence of a Wnt signal, Notch sequesters a cell surface-located pool of Armadillo, probably active Armadillo, traffics with it, and induces its degradation. This possibility is consistent with the effects of overexpression of Notch on the amount and localization of Arm<sup>S10</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000169-g008">Figures 8</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000169-g009">9</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000169.s013">S13</xref>) and with the observation that suppression of endocytosis and traffic by mutations in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Dynamin encoded by <italic>shibire</italic> result in a substantial increase in the amount of Armadillo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000169-Piddini2">&#x0005b;80&#x0005d;</xref> and unpublished data).</p><p>Our results argue for a function of the traffic of Notch in the regulation of the activity and the amounts of Armadillo.

Although it is possible that this reflects a contribution of the transcriptional activity of Notch to the regulation of &#x000df;-catenin, we think this is unlikely to provide the major component as the suppression of &#x000df;-catenin is not Su(H) dependent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000169-Langdon1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>, and in some cases the effect is not only on the activity of &#x000df;-catenin but also its amount <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000169-Nicolas1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>.

One possibility is that cleaved Nintra has interactions and activities that do not involve Su(H) and its vertebrate counterparts, but it might also be the case that under experimental conditions in which there is an excess of this form of Notch, some of it engages in abnormal complexes with proteins that the intracellular domain of Notch normally interacts with, triggering a squelching effect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000169-Ptashne1">&#x0005b;87&#x0005d;</xref> with functional consequences. Taking into account all the evidence presented here, we believe that squelching might be the cause of many of the interactions reported between Nintra and Armadillo/&#x000df;-catenin.

We believe that this is not the case. In fixed-tissue and antibody uptake and chase experiments, a fraction of CeN colocalizes with Notch, suggesting parallel activities of the two molecules. It is likely that the effects of CeN reveal the strong dominant effect on Su(H)-independent activities of Notch, much like Nintra reflects the transcriptional activity of the receptor. CeN also points to the existence of a pool of Notch that is usually in limiting amounts but active in specific trafficking functions.

(A&#x02013;D) Notch and CD8 (from CeN-DM1) tracked over time in the same cells by pulsing CeN-DM1 expressing live wing discs with an antibody against the extracellular domain of Notch (red channel) and CD8 (blue channel), and chasing for 0 (A), 10 (B), 30 (C), and 60 min (D).

After 0 min of chasing, the endogenous Notch and CD8 localize in the apical membrane of the cells (A) and there are no vesicles in subapical or basal levels (A&#x02013;A<sub>2</sub>). After 10 min of chase, Notch and CeNDM1 can mainly still be found in the apical level (suggesting that it remains there for longer time), and some in subapical vesicles (B&#x02013;B<sub>2</sub>). After 30 min, the endogenous Notch and CeNDM1 have been cleared almost completely from the apical membranes and can be found mostly in subapical vesicles that look bigger than the CeN ones. By this time the wild-type Notch and CeN (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000169.s010">Figure S10</xref>) can be detected in the basal domain but not CeN-DM1 (C&#x02013;C<sub>2</sub>). After 60 min of chase, the endogenous Notch and CeN-DM1 localizes in apical, subapical, and basal levels; at this time point, CD8 also goes into vesicles, but mainly in the apical and subapical levels (D&#x02013;D<sub>2</sub>). In all cases the apical and basal images were taken in equivalent levels in the dorsal region of the wing pouch. Notice the large amount of CeN-DM1 that is present at this stage, which contrasts with the lower levels of CeN (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000169.s010">Figure S10</xref>). Scale bar, 10 &#x000b5;m. Circles highlight colocalized stain.

Comparing both CeN and CeN-DM1 localization at 0 and 10 min, it can be said that CeN-DM1 remains for longer time around the cell surface of the cell. At 30 min, there are bigger vesicles in CeN-DM1, suggesting again that this molecule has a defect in its traffic. Moreover, endogenous Notch and CeN (or CeN-DM1) colocalizing vesicles suggest that these molecules can traffic together through the cell. A comparison of this figure with <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000169.s010">Figure S10</xref> suggests that CeN-DM1 can interfere with the traffic of endogenous Notch, as it appears that there is more Notch in the cell surface after 60 min than in the presence of CeN. However, this observation does not seem to have an effect on the function of Notch, as expression of UAS CeN-DM1 under several GAL4 drivers has no phenotypic effect in a wild-type background.</p><p>(4.91 MB TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pbio.1000169.s012.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pbio.1000169.s013"><label>Figure S13</label><caption><p><bold>Armadillo and Notch induce reciprocal alterations in their subcellular localization.</bold> Analysis of the distribution and localization of Arm<sup>S10</sup> (red channel), NICD (in green), and endogenous Arm (blue) in wing discs expressing UAS-Arm<sup>S10</sup> (A); UAS-Arm<sup>S10</sup>;UAS-FLN (B); UAS-Arm<sup>S10</sup>,UAS-CeN (C), under the control of <italic>dpp</italic>-Gal4. Apical (A&#x02013;C) and subapical (A<sub>1</sub>&#x02013;C<sub>1</sub>; 1 &#x000b5;m below the apical section) confocal sections of the dorsal region of the wing pouch are shown. The expression of Arm<sup>S10</sup> promotes an accumulation of endogenous Notch apically and subapically as revealed by increased diffused staining with anti-NICD antibody (A). This accumulation is probably due to the stability of Arm<sup>S10</sup>, which tends to reside in the apical region, apparently have a slower turn over, and thereby stabilize Notch in that region. This result can be seen apically and is particularly obvious subapically, where a large accumulation of Notch can be observed. Expression of both FLN and CeN with Arm<sup>S10</sup> lead to changes in the distribution and appearance of both Arm<sup>S10</sup> and endogenous Arm. Most significantly, overexpressed Notch induces a decrease in the amount of Arm<sup>S10</sup> in the apical surface and its accumulation in the subapical in a diffuse form with some vesicles (compare &#x0005b;A&#x0005d; with &#x0005b;B&#x0005d; and &#x0005b;C&#x0005d;). This effect can also be seen in the endogenous Arm: Arm<sup>S10</sup> displaces it from the apical membrane towards a subapical &#x0201c;shadow&#x0201d; that is gathered into vesicles by FLN and CeN both in apical and subapical sections (B&#x02013;B<sub>1</sub> and C&#x02013;C<sub>2</sub>).
