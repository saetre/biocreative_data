Infections of the respiratory tract are a hallmark in CF. The host immune responses in CF are not adequate to eradicate pathogens, such as <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. Dendritic cells (DC) are crucial in initiation and regulation of immune responses. Changes in DC function could contribute to abnormal immune responses on multiple levels. The role of DC in CF lung disease remains unknown.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>This study investigated the expression of CFTR gene in bone marrow-derived DC.

DC from CF mice showed a delayed in the early phase of differentiation. Gene expression analysis in DC generated from naive CF and WT mice revealed decreased expression of Caveolin-1 (Cav1), a membrane lipid raft protein, in the CF DC compared to WT DC. Consistently, protein and activity levels of the sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP), a negative regulator of Cav1 expression, were increased in CF DC. Following exposure to <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, expression of 3&#x003b2;-hydroxysterol-&#x00394;7 reductase (Dhcr7) and stearoyl-CoA desaturase 2 (Scd2), two enzymes involved in the lipid metabolism that are also regulated by SREBP, was less decreased in the CF DC compared to WT DC.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These results suggest that CFTR dysfunction in DC affects factors involved in membrane structure and lipid-metabolism, which may contribute to the abnormal inflammatory and immune response characteristic of CF.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by mutations in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, a member of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) protein family that functions as a cAMP-dependent chloride channel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. ABC transport proteins play important roles in a variety of tissues including lung, liver, pancreas and the immune system[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Although CF is primarily thought to be a disease of abnormal salt and fluid transport caused by the defective chloride channel function of the CFTR protein, dominant additional features of defective CFTR include an exaggerated inflammatory response and susceptibility to microbial colonization in the lung, particularly with <italic>P. aeruginosa </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The exact mechanism for this is not completely understood. Overall in CF, host immune responses do not seem to be adequate to eradicate <italic>P. aeruginosa </italic>from the respiratory tract. Attention in this regard has been primarily focused on the role of CFTR in epithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. However, functional expression of CFTR has been demonstrated in a variety of non-epithelial cells, including lymphocytes, neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages and endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The widespread distribution of CFTR expression in non-epithelial cells and cells of the immune system implies a variety of functions, including a possible regulatory role in the secretion of cytokines and antibodies by lymphocytes and regulation of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and interferon-&#x003b3;-induced macrophage activation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In murine alveolar macrophages CFTR-expression is related to lysosomal acidification and intracellular killing of <italic>P. aeruginosa </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], and macrophages directly contribute to the exaggerated inflammatory response in CFTR knockout mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The interaction of the CF-specific infectious organisms with cells of the host immune system are likely important in determining the extent of the inflammatory responses and the subsequent clearance of the bacteria from the airways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>Abnormalities in the lipid metabolism have been described in CF patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], and have been suggested to be related to the inflammatory responses in CF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Deficiency of essential fatty acids is thought to be primarily a result of defective intestinal fat absorption secondary to a deficiency of pancreatic lipase due to obstruction of the pancreatic ducts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. It has furthermore been suggested that mutant CFTR plays a role in cellular essential fatty acid utilization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The misassembled deltaF508 CFTR leads to altered cellular lipid trafficking in the distal secretory pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Localization of CFTR to lipid rafts, cellular lipid membrane domains that are enriched cholesterol and sphingolipids, has been described following infection with <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, and has been linked to inflammatory signaling and apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>The present study analyzed dendritic cells (DC) derived from CF and WT mice. DC are the most potent antigen presenting cells and are crucial in the initiation and regulation of immune responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Changes in DC function could contribute to abnormal immune responses on multiple levels, such as antigen processing and presentation, expression of costimulatory molecules, and production of cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The DC from CF mice were delayed in their differentiation compared to the WT mice, but were able to reach fully maturation after 8 days. Interestingly, of the relatively few genes found to be down-regulated comparing CF and WT DC in gene expression studies, was Caveolin-1 (Cav1), a lipid raft membrane protein related to the cellular lipid metabolism. The protein expression and activity of the sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP), a negative regulator of Cav1 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], was increased in CF DC compared to WT DC. Among the genes showing expression change comparing WT and CF DC upon <italic>P. aeruginosa </italic>infection, were 3&#x003b2;-hydroxysterol-&#x00394;7 reductase (Dhcr7) and stearoyl-CoA desaturase 2 (Scd2), two enzymes involved in the lipid metabolism that are also regulated by SREBP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. This study provides insight into CFTR-dependant gene expression abnormalities related to the cellular lipid homeostasis in a non-epithelial cell type.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Mice</title><p>Congenic C57BL/6J heterozygous breeding pairs (<italic>Cftr</italic><sup>tm1UNC</sup>) were maintained on regular mouse chow and continuously bred.

DC were purified from six mice with age 5 to 6 wk old. Total RNA was extracted from the DC using TRIzol followed by RNeasy (Qiagen, CA) to remove residual DNA. First strand cDNA was synthesized using the T7-(dT)<sub>24 </sub>primer (sequence 5'-GGC CAG TGA ATT GTA ATA CGA CTC ACT ATA GGG AGG CGG-(dT)<sub>24</sub>-3', HPLC purified from Oligos Etc., OR) and converted to double stranded cDNA using Superscript Choice system (Life Technologies).

This material was then used for synthesis of the biotinylated RNA transcript using the BioArray HighYield reagents (Enzo), purified by the RNeasy kit (Qiagen) and fragmented immediately before use. The labeled cRNA was first hybridized to the test chip and then, when satisfactory, to the MG-U74Av2 GeneChip for 16 h.

Following infection with <italic>P. aeruginosa </italic>gene expression between CF and WT DC differed for a number of genes. Of these, Dhcr7 and Scd2, two members of the lipid metabolism enzymes that are also regulated by SREBP, were found to be differently regulated.</p><sec><title>CFTR in DC</title><p>Expression of CFTR in DC has so far not been reported.

This could suggest that the regulation of CFTR mRNA expression in <italic>Cftr</italic><sup>tm1UNC </sup>may vary in different tissue or cell types.

In CF infants, CFTR mutation itself could produce an inflammatory milieu in the airway even in absence of pathogen infection, suggesting dysfunctional immune regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Slowed differentiation of DC could lead to reduced inhibitory regulation of inflammatory mediators, and it could be direct effect of deficient CFTR expression.

As the RNA in these studies was derived from tissues containing a variety of cell types, a direct comparison with the results of the present study is difficult. It is possible that cultured cells respond differently compared to the cells <italic>in vivo</italic>, as the DC are cultured in enhanced medium with supplemented cytokines. However our gene profile study could still provide an insight in the influence of CFTR on function of DC.</p><p>Cav1 mRNA and protein were decreased in the CF DC compared to the WT DC. Caveolin is the principal component of caveolae, lipid domains characterized by a flask-shaped invaginated morphology, which play a role in endocytosis, signal transuction and the cellular transport of cholesterol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. Cav1 has not been previously reported to be directly affected in CF. However, CFTR was found to localize to lipid rafts membrane fractions characterized by an enrichment of Cav1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. The co-localization of CFTR and Cav1 could suggest a potential interaction between the two proteins. Cav1 expression is negatively regulated by SREBP, a critical factor in cellular lipid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Activation of SREBP, using a promoter reporter assay, has been reported in CF cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>].

Most genes belonged to the functional categories of inflammation, signaling, metabolism and transcription <italic>etc</italic>. The majority of up-regulated genes were immune response related genes (112 of 465), which presents the typical character of DC upon pathogen infection. A multiple correction is one strategey to confront the problem of false positives in microarray study. However our study and other similar studies cannot count with sample size sufficiently large to afford a multiple test comparison. As physiological effect are often small in magnitude and rather than missing potentially important observation, we chose to forgo the use of multiple comparison in favor of confirmation by an independent method (TaqMan RT-PCR), of those observations that are most biologically relevant for our study system. The results that are not confirmed by RT-PCR could be tentative.</p><p>The magnitudes of gene expression changes were mostly larger in WT mice than CF mice (782 of 912); especially 27 interferon/interleukin induced genes.

This observation is in agreement with the fact that the presence of WT CFTR in human bronchial epithelial cell positively influenced cytokines of innate immunity in response to <italic>P. aeruginosa </italic>such as interleukin-8 (IL-8), IL-6, CXCL1, indicating CFTR plays a role in resistance to <italic>P. aeruginosa </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>].</p><p>The expression levels of 30 lipid metabolism related genes were changed by more than 1.5-fold (13 up-regulated genes and 17 down-regulated genes). Cav1, which was virtually absent in non-infected CF DC, was increased upon the <italic>P. aeruginosa </italic>infection with similar fold change in WT and CF mice. The LPS stimulation in endothelial cells induces the expression of Cav1 in a NF-&#x003ba;B-dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. It might serve as an underlying mechanism of upregulation of Cav1 expression in DC followed with <italic>P. aeruginosa </italic>infection.</p><p>In contrast, two other lipid metabolism related genes, Dhcr7 and Scd2, were strongly decreased in WT DC, but only to a much lesser extent in CF DC. Dhcr7 converts dehydrocholesterol (DHC) to cholesterol, and Dhcr7 deficiency in human leads to a syndrome characterized by immunological changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. Stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD) is an enzyme that catalyzes the &#x00394;9-cis desaturation of saturated fatty acyl-CoA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>]. Both Dhcr7 and Scd2 genes contain a sterol-regulatory element, the binding site for the transcription factor SREBP, in their promoter regions. In contrast to Cav1, Dhcr7 and Scd2 expressions are up-regulated by the active form of SREBP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. <italic>P. aeruginosa </italic>infection induces the apoptosis of the host cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>], and SREBP is cleaved during programmed cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>].
