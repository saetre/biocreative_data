After recovering a hybrid-dysgenesis-induced mutation of Tpl we used a rapid combination of transposon tagging, chromosome microdissection and PCR to clone the P element that had transposed into the Tpl region. That P element is located within the gene for a new and unique member of the RNA helicase family. This new helicase differs from all others known by having glycine-rich repeats at both the amino and carboxyl termini. Curiously, genetic analysis shows that the P element inserted into this gene is not responsible for the Tpl mutant phenotype. We present possible explanations for these findings.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00202-0144-a" xlink:role="5490"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00202-0146-a" xlink:role="5492"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00202-0143.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5489"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00202-0144.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5490"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00202-0145.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5491"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00202-0146.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5492"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00202-0147.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5493"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00202-0148.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5494"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
