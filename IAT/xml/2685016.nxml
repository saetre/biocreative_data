However, the environmental cues and signaling pathways that regulate Htt proteolysis are poorly understood. One stimulus may be the DNA damage that accumulates in neurons over time, and the subsequent activation of signaling pathways such as those regulated by I&#x003ba;B kinase (IKK), which can influence neurodegeneration in HD.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>We asked whether DNA damage induces the proteolysis of Htt and if activation of IKK plays a role. We report that treatment of neurons with the DNA damaging agent etoposide or &#x003b3;-irradiation promotes cleavage of wild type (WT) and mutant Htt, generating N-terminal fragments of 80&#x02013;90 kDa. This event requires IKK&#x003b2; and is suppressed by IKK&#x003b1;. Elevated levels of IKK&#x003b1;, or inhibition of IKK&#x003b2; expression by a specific small hairpin RNA (shRNA) or its activity by sodium salicylate, prevents Htt proteolysis and increases neuronal resistance to DNA damage. Moreover, IKK&#x003b2; phosphorylates the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-xL, a modification known to reduce Bcl-xL levels, and activates caspases that can cleave Htt. When IKK&#x003b2; expression is blocked, etoposide treatment does not decrease Bcl-xL and activation of caspases is diminished. Similar to silencing of IKK&#x003b2;, increasing the level of Bcl-xL in neurons prevents etoposide-induced caspase activation and Htt proteolysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>These results indicate that DNA damage triggers cleavage of Htt and identify IKK&#x003b2; as a prominent regulator. Moreover, IKK&#x003b2;-dependent reduction of Bcl-xL is important in this process. Thus, inhibition of IKK&#x003b2; may promote neuronal survival in HD as well as other DNA damage-induced neurodegenerative disorders.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Huntington's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by expansion of a CAG repeat, which is translated into a polyglutamine (polyQ) stretch in the N-terminus of Htt protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005768-The1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

A role for IKK&#x003b2; is supported by the inability of etoposide to reduce Bcl-xL in neurons expressing an shRNA targeting IKK&#x003b2;, or following pretreatment with sodium salicylate, a potent inhibitor of IKK&#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005768-g006">Figs. 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005768-g007">7</xref>). We propose that IKK&#x003b2; reduces Bcl-xL levels by phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005768-g006">Fig. 6C</xref>), a modification known to promote Bcl-xL degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005768-Du1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. Phosphorylation-dependent reduction of Bcl-xL is suggested to play a role in spinal cord neuronal injury and is implicated in Htt proteolysis in the striatum of 3-nitropropionic acid injected mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005768-Lee1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005768-Cittelly1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, reduction of Bcl-xL may be the signal that leads to activation of caspases that target Htt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005768-g008">Fig. 8</xref>). Inhibition of caspase-3 activation and Htt proteolysis in neurons with elevated Bcl-xL further supports this notion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005768-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>).</p><p>Environmental factors appear to play a role in the development of HD, since the age of onset is variable among patients with similar polyQ expansions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005768-Wexler1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>. Accumulation of DNA damage as well as activation of modifiers that influence Htt proteolysis could impact disease progression. Our data indicate that IKK&#x003b2; induced by DNA damage in neurons can be very significant, and inhibition of IKK&#x003b2; can prevent depletion of WT Htt as well as the production of toxic N-terminal fragments of mutant Htt. It is noteworthy that IKK&#x003b2; is itself activated by N-terminal fragments of mutant Htt <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005768-Khoshnan1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, Htt proteolysis and IKK&#x003b2; activation can form a toxic feedback loop that could promote neurodegeneration. This cycle can be influenced by cytokines that are induced by IKK&#x003b2; activation and which are elevated in HD patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005768-Bjrkqvist1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. IKK&#x003b1;, on the other hand, may act as a brake to suppress excessive IKK&#x003b2; activation and reduce neurotoxicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005768-g008">Fig. 8</xref>). Thus, the ratio of IKK&#x003b1; to IKK&#x003b2; activity may be a determinant of Htt proteolysis in stressed neurons. Identification of the IKKs as regulators of Htt proteolysis offers novel targets to search for molecules that prevent one of the earliest events in HD pathogenesis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Antibodies and reagents</title><p>Anti-Htt (mAb 2166), and PSD-95 antibodies were purchased from Millipore (Temecula, CA).
