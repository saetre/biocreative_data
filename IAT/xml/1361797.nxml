Theodor Boveri hypothesized nearly 100 years ago that aneuploidy was due to an increase in centrosome number (multipolar mitoses) and the resultant abnormal segregation of chromosomes. We performed immunocytochemistry, quantitative immunofluorescence, karyotypic analysis, and time-lapse microscopy on primary human diploid epithelial cells and fibroblasts to better understand the mechanism involved in the production of supernumerary centrosomes (more than two microtubule nucleating bodies) to directly demonstrate that the presence of supernumerary centrosomes in genomically intact cells generates aneuploid daughter cells. We show that loss of p16 <sup>INK4a</sup> generates supernumerary centrosomes through centriole pair splitting. Generation of supernumerary centrosomes in human diploid epithelial cells was shown to nucleate multipolar spindles and directly drive production of aneuploid daughter cells as a result of unequal segregation of the genomic material during mitosis. Finally, we demonstrate that p16 <sup>INK4a</sup> cooperates with p21 through regulation of cyclin-dependent kinase activity to prevent centriole pair splitting. Cells with loss of p16 <sup>INK4a</sup> activity have been found in vivo in histologically normal mammary tissue from a substantial fraction of healthy, disease-free women. Demonstration of centrosome dysfunction in cells due to loss of p16 <sup>INK4a</sup> suggests that, under the appropriate conditions, these cells can become aneuploid. Gain or loss of genomic material (aneuploidy) may provide the necessary proproliferation and antiapoptotic mechanisms needed for the earliest stages of tumorigenesis. </p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>Here the authors show that aneuploidy (where a cell has an abnormal number of chromosomes) can be caused by cells having an abnormal number of centrosomes, which leads to asymmetric cell division.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>One of the hallmarks of cancer is the accumulation of genomic abnormalities. Aneuploidy is the most frequently identified genomic abnormality in cancer and has been shown to occur early in progression, often observed in premalignant lesions. Aneuploidy is also seen in histologically normal tissue adjacent to cancer, strongly suggesting that increased dosage of oncogenic genes and decreased dosage of tumor suppressor genes may be involved in the earliest stages of tumorigenesis &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040051-b001">1</xref>&#x02013; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040051-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d;. The mechanism by which aneuploidy is generated in the earliest stages of tumorigenesis is poorly understood. In his famous <italic>Zur Frage der Entstehung maligner Tumoren</italic> (The Origin of Malignant Tumors), published in 1914, Theodor Boveri hypothesized that multipolar mitoses cause aneuploidy &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040051-b006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040051-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d;. Events resulting in supernumerary centrosomes (more than two functional microtubule nucleating bodies) can lead to multipolar spindles and, as proposed by Boveri, lead to improper segregation of the sister chromatids and generate aneuploid daughter cells. The recent discovery of supernumerary centrosomes in premalignant and malignant lesions of the breast and their correlation with aneuploidy has provided support for Boveri's hypothesis &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040051-b008">8</xref>&#x02013; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040051-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;. However, it is still unclear whether supernumerary centrosomes drive aneuploidy or simply reflect preceding consequences of aneuploidy &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040051-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;. </p><p>During the normal cell cycle of mammalian cells, the centrosome is duplicated once and only once to ensure that during mitosis each daughter cell inherits one mature centrosome containing two centrioles &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040051-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;. The centrosome duplication cycle is initiated late in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. During S phase, the first physical manifestation of centrosome duplication is splitting of one centrosome into two immature centrosomes, each containing one centriole. Synthesis of the new daughter centrioles continues through S phase, using the mother centriole as a template. Beginning in early mitosis, the centrosomes migrate to opposite poles of the cell to establish the bipolar spindle, which is critical for segregation of the duplicated DNA (sister chromatids). While cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (Cdk2) activity has been shown to be required for initiation of centrosome duplication &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040051-b014">14</xref>&#x02013; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040051-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;, the molecular pathways that ensure that centrosomes are duplicated once and only once within the normal cell cycle are not well understood. Coupling of the centrosome duplication and DNA replication cycles is crucial for preventing multiple rounds of centrosome duplication within a single DNA replication cycle. Uncoupling of these two cycles is one mechanism by which generation of supernumerary centrosomes may arise &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040051-b018">18</xref>&#x02013; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040051-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d;. For example, in the event that the DNA replication cycle was stalled (e.g., for DNA repair), lack of inhibition of the centrosome duplication cycle may allow for the accumulation of more than two centrosomes. </p><p>In this report, we use primary cultures of human mammary epithelial cells (HMECs) to investigate the mechanism by which cells acquire supernumerary centrosomes. Further, we determine that the acquisition of supernumerary centrosomes in genomically intact cells results in aneuploid daughter cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Variant HMECs Accumulate Abnormal Centrosomes with Continued Population Doublings</title><p>HMECs comprise the majority of cells that expand in culture from mammary tissues obtained from healthy women &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040051-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;. When grown in vitro under standard conditions, these cells proliferate for a limited time (five to 20 population doublings &#x0005b;PD&#x0005d;) before reaching a proliferation barrier termed <italic>selection</italic> ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040051-g001">Figure 1</xref>). A small subpopulation of variant cells (vHMECs) has the ability to proliferate an additional 20 to 70 PDs beyond selection ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040051-g001">Figure 1</xref>A), upon which they enter a phase termed <italic>agonesence,</italic> where they accumulate genomic abnormalities, including aneuploidy, polyploidy, structural changes (deletions/translocations) and telomeric associations &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040051-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;. These genomically unstable vHMECs also contain abnormal mitotic metaphases, such as tripolar mitoses ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040051-g001">Figure 1</xref>B), suggesting that the genomic instability seen in vHMECs is, in part, due to centrosome abnormalities. </p><p>To determine if centrosome abnormalities are present in vHMECs, we examined the centrosomes of these cells using an antibody that recognized &#x003b3;-tubulin, a component of pericentriolar material, and an antibody that recognized centrin, a component of centrioles ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040051-g001">Figure 1</xref>F, inset) &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040051-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d;. We focused on the study of mononucleated cells with more than two centrosomes to identify events that generate more than two centrosomes in genomically intact diploid cells. Mononucleated cells from two different reduction mammoplasties (RM9 and RM16) were analyzed to control for interindividual variations. HMECs were analyzed prior to the proliferation barrier, and vHMECs were analyzed early and late along their respective growth curves as indicated by the line graph ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040051-g001">Figure 1</xref>A), which represents the growth curve of cells isolated from a single reduction mammoplasty (RM16). The incidence of HMECs with more than two centrosomes is negligible (average of 1&#x00025;) ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040051-g001">Figure 1</xref>A, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040051-g001">1</xref>C, and 1E). Similarly, the average fraction of early-passage vHMECs with more than two centrosomes was not statistically different ( <italic>p</italic> = 0.07) than that seen in HMECs ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040051-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). As illustrated by the standard deviation seen in early-passage vHMECs ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040051-g001">Figure 1</xref>A), there are minor differences between individuals in the fraction of mononucleated cells with more than two centrosomes (ranging from 1&#x00025; to 5&#x00025;). In contrast, mononucleated vHMECs analyzed at late passage and agonescence contained an average of 10&#x00025; and 32&#x00025; of cells with more than two centrosomes, respectively ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040051-g001">Figure 1</xref>A, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040051-g001">1</xref>D, and 1F), which correlated with the increase in genomic instability seen in late-passage and agonescent vHMECs &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040051-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;. </p><p>To validate that the mononucleated vHMECs with more than two centrosomes at agonescence are not of polyploid DNA content, we directly determined the DNA content of each cell containing more than two centrosomes. We performed quantitative fluorescence on cells stained with propidium iodide (PI) (DNA content) and an antibody that recognized &#x003b3;-tubulin (centrosome number). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040051-g001">Figure 1</xref>G, the majority (94&#x00025;) of the mononucleated vHMECs with more than two centrosomes had a diploid DNA content, demonstrating that mononucleated vHMECs with more than two centrosomes are not generated as a result of polyploidization. </p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>vHMECs Acquire Supernumerary Centrosomes following Inhibition of DNA Synthesis</title><p>One mechanism by which excessive duplication of centrosomes can arise is due to uncoupling of the centrosome duplication and DNA replication cycles. To investigate if these two cycles are coupled in HMECs and vHMECs, we exposed the cells to a transient inhibition of DNA synthesis as previously described &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040051-b017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040051-b024">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040051-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d;. Exposure to hydroxyurea (HU), a reversible inhibitor of DNA synthesis, allows the cells to transition into S phase of the cell cycle but prevents them from progressing through S phase ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040051-g002">Figure 2</xref>). In cells with coupled centrosome duplication and DNA replication cycles, centrosome duplication (generating two centrosomes) occurs; however, centrosome reduplication or generation of supernumerary centrosomes (generating more than two centrosomes) is prevented. </p><p>HMECs and vHMECs from RM9 and RM16 were exposed to 4 mM HU for 48 h and were subsequently analyzed by immunocytochemistry with anti&#x02013;&#x003b3;-tubulin antibody for centrosome number. Exposure of HMECs to HU arrested DNA synthesis but resulted in no statistically significant ( <italic>p</italic> = 0.60) increase in the fraction of mononucleated cells with more than two centrosomes compared to the untreated HMEC population ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040051-g002">Figure 2</xref>B, black bars, and 2C). In contrast, early-passage vHMECs exposed to HU had a dramatic increase in cells with more than two centrosomes. Untreated early-passage vHMECs contained a negligible background of cells with more than two centrosomes (&#x02212;HU: average of 2&#x00025;), whereas these same cells exposed to HU generated a striking increase in mononucleated cells with more than two centrosomes (+HU: RM9 and RM16, 18&#x00025; and 22&#x00025;, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040051-g002">Figure 2</xref>B, red bars, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040051-g002">2</xref>E). While the majority of the HU-exposed vHMECs with more than two centrosomes contained three or four centrosomes, a small fraction (2&#x00025;) containing more than four centrosomes were also observed ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040051-g002">Figure 2</xref>E, closed arrowhead). Analysis of the number of centrosomes following exposure to HU for longer periods of time (72, 96, and 144 h) demonstrated no statistically significant increase ( <italic>p</italic> = 0.62, <italic>p</italic> = 0.729, and <italic>p</italic> = 1.00, respectively) in the fraction of vHMECs with more than two centrosomes as compared to vHMECs exposed to HU for 48 h. Longer exposure to HU also did not result in an increase in the fraction of cells (average of 2&#x00025;) containing more than four centrosomes. </p><p>Two additional experiments assured us that the mononucleated cells with more than two centrosomes did not represent a polyploid population. vHMECs were sorted by flow cytometry for low forward scatter and side scatter (low FSC/SSC) and were analyzed for DNA content by staining with PI. PI staining demonstrated that the low FSC/SSC sorted population is enriched for cells containing a 2N DNA content and contains a reduced polyploid population, ranging from 0.6&#x00025; to 1.5&#x00025;. Treatment of low FSC/SSC vHMEC population (RM16) for 48 h with HU resulted in an average of 12&#x00025; of the mononucleated cells with more than two centrosomes ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040051-g002">Figure 2</xref>B, blue bars). This represented a statistically significant ( <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.005) increase over the average 0.4&#x00025; observed in the untreated, low FSC/SSC sorted population. </p><p>In the second experiment, we performed quantitative fluorescence analysis to directly determine the DNA content of each individual HU-exposed, early-passage vHMEC as described above. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040051-g002">Figure 2F</xref>, 100&#x00025; of the mononucleated, HU-exposed early-passage vHMECs with more than two centrosomes had a diploid DNA content. Taken together, these results demonstrate that the generation of more than two centrosomes following inhibition of DNA synthesis is not a result of polyploidization. </p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Loss of p16 <sup>INK4a</sup> Plays a Causal Role in Centrosome Dysfunction in HMECs </title><p>Little is known about the mechanisms that prevent acquisition of more than two centrosomes.

This difference prompted us to more closely examine the supernumerary centrosomes of the vHMECs during S phase arrest. Early-passage vHMECs expressing the centriolar protein enhanced GFP (EGFP)-human centrin 2 (CETN2) were exposed to HU for 48 h and subsequently analyzed by immunocytochemistry with an antibody that recognizes the &#x003b3;-tubulin protein to determine centriole number per centrosome.

To assess if Cdk2 activity is required for acquisition of more than two centrosomes, the Cdk2 inhibitor purvalanol A or roscovitine was added (10 &#x003bc;M) to vHMECs that had been exposed to HU for 36 h, incubated for an additional 12 h, and analyzed for the number of centrosomes per cell ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040051-g008">Figure 8</xref>B). vHMECs did not acquire more than two centrosomes following HU exposure in the presence of purvalanol A and roscovitine ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040051-g008">Figure 8</xref>B).

Therefore, results demonstrating that both inhibitors prevent generation of more than two centrosomes strongly implicate a specific role for regulation of Cdk2 activity in uncoupling of the centrosome duplication and DNA replication cycles. These results suggest that p16 <sup>INK4a</sup> prevents centrosome dysfunction through regulation of Cdk2 activity. </p><p>Expression of p16 <sup>INK4a</sup> has been shown to regulate Cdk2 activity and consequently centrosome biology through both pRb (retinoblastoma)-dependent and pRb-independent mechanisms (see model, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040051-g008">Figure 8</xref>D). First, p16 <sup>INK4a</sup> acts through a pRb-dependent pathway via binding to Cdk4 and inhibition of the cyclin D1/Cdk4 complex. In the absence of active cyclin D1/Cdk4 complex, pRb remains associated with E2F, thereby inhibiting transcriptional activation of the Cdk2 binding partners, cyclin E and A ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040051-g008">Figure 8</xref>D, #1). Alternatively, acting through a pRb-independent pathway, expression of p16 <sup>INK4a</sup> and its disruption of the association of the cyclin D1/Cdk4 complex have also been shown to directly inhibit Cdk2 activity through a second mechanism. The Cdk inhibitor p21 has been shown to be an assembly factor for the cyclin D1/Cdk4 complex. Therefore, p16 <sup>INK4a</sup>-mediated dissociation of the cyclin D1/Cdk4/p21 complex results in release of p21. When unbound p21 accumulates to a certain threshold, it binds to and inactivates the cyclin E/A-Cdk2 complex ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040051-g008">Figure 8</xref>D, #2) &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040051-b034">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040051-b035">35</xref>&#x0005d;. </p><p>To test the proposed pRB-independent model, we used normal human diploid fibroblasts (HDFs) that have p21 inactivated through targeted homologous recombination (p21 <sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>) &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040051-b036">36</xref>&#x0005d;.

Cells with supernumerary centrosomes were shown to divide into two nuclei or more than two nuclei. Quantitation revealed that both events resulted in unequal segregation of the DNA. The fold differences observed when cells with supernumerary centrosomes divide into two nuclei likely reflect the unequal segregation of one to two chromosomes (aneuploidy), an interpretation supported by the corresponding karyotypic analysis of these cells. When the cells divide into more than one nucleus, often two or more of the nuclei remain together to form one cell, representing a mechanism for the formation of binucleated and multinucleated cells. These results strongly suggest that supernumerary centrosomes can indeed cause aneuploidy (genomic instability). </p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>p16 <sup>INK4a</sup> Plays a Critical Role in Centrosome Biology </title><p>Our results described a new function of p16 <sup>INK4a</sup> and further demonstrated the importance of p16 <sup>INK4a</sup> in the maintenance of normal cellular properties. In this study, p16 <sup>INK4a</sup> activity was found to be both necessary and sufficient to prevent centriole pair splitting. The p16 <sup>INK4a</sup>-dependent centrosome dysfunction was rapidly unmasked under conditions that transiently inhibit DNA synthesis and was gradually unmasked during standard growth in culture. As vHMECs proliferate in culture, they are increasingly exposed to internal signals (e.g., replicative stress, endogenous DNA damage, etc.) and external signals (e.g., oxidative stress, etc.) leading to cell cycle checkpoint responses. We hypothesize that these signals result in transient inhibition of DNA synthesis, thereby providing the opportunity for vHMECs to accumulate greater than two centrosomes as they mature in culture. </p><p>We provide evidence that the p16 <sup>INK4a</sup>-dependent centrosome dysfunction results from unregulated Cdk2 activity.

The HeLa cell line contains integrated human papillomavirus (HPV18) and therefore has defective pRb and p53 functions/signaling. Paradoxically, despite loss of these functions, HeLa cells do not have centrosome dysfunction following HU exposure. The shRNA against p16 <sup>INK4a</sup> should have no affect on coupling in HeLa cells if the coupling is a pRb-mediated event. Therefore, our demonstration that HeLa cells become uncoupled when p16 <sup>INK4a</sup> expression is suppressed suggests that p16 <sup>INK4a</sup> is working through a pRb-independent pathway. As described, a pRb-independent pathway by which p16 <sup>INK4a</sup> can regulate Cdk2 activity works through regulation of the bioavailability of the Cdk inhibitor p21 (see model, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040051-g008">Figure 8</xref>D).

An important caveat in studying signaling pathways in established tumor cell lines is the reality that they contain a plethora of mutations with unknown consequences on the pathways studied. Therefore, we assessed the pRb-independent model in normal human diploid cells with intact signaling pathways. Our data provide evidence that p16 <sup>INK4a</sup> can act independent of pRb to regulate Cdk2 activity and to couple the DNA replication and centrosome duplication cycles. These experiments also provide evidence that the inactivation of p16 <sup>INK4a</sup> will engender phenotypes beyond those that are induced simply by inactivation of pRb. </p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Transient Inhibition of DNA Replication, Often Observed with Chemotherapeutic Agents, Is Needed to Unmask Centrosomal Dysfunction</title><p>A previous report examined normal human oral keratinocytes engineered to inhibit p16 <sup>INK4a</sup> function through overexpression of Cdk4 &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040051-b038">38</xref>&#x0005d;.

Our results in the HMEC system are consistent with this report. In data presented here, the removal of p16 <sup>INK4a</sup> activity (by expression of shRNA) did not, in and of itself, generate more than two centrosomes. The p16 <sup>INK4a</sup>-suppressed cells required the transient inhibition of DNA synthesis to unmask the uncoupled cycles and generate more than two centrosomes.

Further insight into the mechanism by which p16 <sup>INK4a</sup> prevents generation of more than two centrosomes during cell cycle arrest was gained from the observation that, in the absence of p16 <sup>INK4a</sup>, the duplicated centrosomes progress into a second round of centrosome duplication that ceases at the stage of centriole pair splitting.

Blocking and antibody dilution buffer was PBS containing 5&#x00025; goat serum (GIBCO-BRL, San Diego, California, United States), 0.1&#x00025; bovine serum albumin (Sigma, St. Louis, Missouri, United States), 0.1&#x00025; fish skin gelatin (Sigma), and 1&#x00025; glycerol (Fisher Scientific, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States). A monoclonal antibody recognizing &#x003b3;-tubulin (clone GTU-88; Sigma) was used at 1 &#x003bc;g/ml to immunostain the pericentriolar material of the centrosome. An antibody recognizing centrin (clone 20H5) was used at 1:1,000 dilution to immunostain the centrioles of the centrosome. The centrin antibody was kindly provided by Dr. J. Salisbury. A monoclonal antibody recognizing &#x003b3;-tubulin (clone DM1A; Sigma) was used at 1:1,000 dilution to immunostain microtubules. A monoclonal antibody recognizing p16 <sup>INK4a</sup> (clone Ab-7; NeoMarkers, Lab Vision Corp., Fremont, California, United States) was used at 1:100 dilution. Secondary antibody used for detection of the anti&#x02013;&#x003b3;-tubulin, the anti-centrin, the anti&#x02013;&#x003b3;-tubulin, and the anti-p16INK4a antibodies was a fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated sheep F(ab&#x02032;)2 fragment to mouse IgG (whole molecule) (ICN/Cappel Biomedicals, Costa Mesa, California, United States) or a tetramethylrodamine (TRITC)-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (Southern Biotechnologies, Birmingham, Alabama, United States). DNA was stained using DAPI (Vector Technologies, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States) or ToPro3 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, Oregon, United States). Glass coverslips were mounted to slides with anti-fade mounting media (Vectashield; Vector Technologies). Samples were analyzed on a Zeiss 510 LSM confocal microscope using an Argon/2 laser (excitation 488 nm), a HeNe2 laser (excitation 633 nm), and a titanium:sapphire dual-photon laser (tuned to 790 nm). Standard deviation between separate experimental trials performed under identical conditions was determined and expressed as error bars when appropriate. Statistical significance was determined by the two-sided Fischer exact test (95&#x00025; confidence interval). </p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Cell cycle analysis</title><p>Cells were plated at a density of 2 &#x000d7; 10 <sup>3</sup> cells/cm <sup>2</sup>.

Immunocytochemistry for &#x003b3;-tubulin was performed as described above. DNA was stained using 3 &#x003bc;g/ml PI and 0.2 mg/ml RNase in PBS for 1 h at room temperature, as previously described. The coverslips were mounted as described and the samples were analyzed on a Zeiss 510 LSM confocal microscope using an Argon/2 laser (excitation 488 nm) and a HeNe1 laser (excitation 543 nm). Quantification of DNA content for each cell was determined using Velocity software (Improvision, Lexington, Massachusetts, United States) to determination the total sum of PI signal (intensity) for each nucleus. Dot-blot analysis (centrosome number versus PI intensity) allowed us to determine whether cells had a 2N-4N DNA content (diploid) or a more than 4N DNA content (polyploidy). Note that cells of 2N DNA content were determined empirically for each sample set by assigning cells with one centrosome as 2N. The cells of 4N and more than 4N DNA content were then extrapolated from this value. Background subtraction of fluorescent signal was performed in areas not containing nuclei.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Reduction of polyploid population in vHMECs</title><p>vHMECs were grown on plastic tissue culture plates, trypsinized, washed, and sorted by FSC versus SSC on an FACSVantage SE (Becton-Dickinson).

Transfection frequency was routinely greater than 60&#x00025;, as determined by parallel transfection of Phoenix-A cells with a plasmid containing a GFP expression cassette (data not shown). Cells were infected by exposing them to virus-containing medium for 4&#x02013;6 h, each with an intervening 20-h recovery period. At 72&#x02013;96 h after the first infection, cells were trypsinized and plated in the presence of 4 &#x003bc;g/ml Puromycin (Sigma) or 20 &#x003bc;g/ml Hygromycin (Sigma). Following infection, cells were maintained in medium containing 4 &#x003bc;g/ml Puromycin and/or 20 &#x003bc;g/ml Hygromycin as appropriate. Infection frequencies were routinely in the range of 3&#x00025; to 10&#x00025;, as determined by colony formation assays. </p></sec><sec id="s4h"><title>Chromosomal analysis</title><p>Metaphase spreads were prepared from cells treated with colcemid (KaryoMAX; GIBCO-BRL, 100 ng/ml for 2 h).

The EGFP&#x02013;&#x003b3;-tubulin and EGFP-H2B fusion proteins were excited using a two-photon, titanium:sapphire laser (tuned to 880 nm). During image acquisition, the cells are maintained at a constant temperature of 37 &#x000b0;C with 5&#x00025; CO <sub>2</sub> using a heated stage, a stage-mounted incubator, and a CO <sub>2</sub> regulator (Zeiss). A <italic>z</italic>-stack was acquired every 3&#x02013;4 min. During image acquisition, the microscope was enclosed with a Plexiglas box custom made with a heater and fan (TX7 Wired Dome assembly; Lyon Electric Company, Chula Vista, California, United States) to maintain a temperature of 32&#x02013;37 &#x000b0;C to minimize the thermal drift of the microsope. An objective heater (Zeiss) was also used at 37 &#x000b0;C to minimize thermal drift of the objective. Quantification of DNA content for each cell was determined using Velocity software (Improvision) to determination the total sum of EGFP-H2B signal (intensity) for each nucleus. The EGFP-H2B signal of daughter cells was quantified from up to ten time frames per mitotic division of those that resulted from mitotic division with two or more than two centrosomes. The fold difference between the daughter cells (signal intensity of daughter cell 1/signal intensity of daughter cell 2) was determined for each time frame. The fold differences of each time frame were than averaged to determine the average fold difference. Note that EGFP&#x02013;&#x003b3;-tubulin signal was not always able to be separated from the EGFP-H2B signal when selecting and quantifying. To ensure that the selection of EGFP&#x02013;&#x003b3;-tubulin signal is not contributing significantly to the determined fold differences, we determined the signal intensity of single centrosomes (EGFP&#x02013;&#x003b3;-tubulin signal) as compared to a clearly defined nuclei (EGFP-H2B signal). The average total signal intensity of a single centrosome is less than 0.3&#x00025; of the total signal intensity of a nucleus. Thus, the signal intensity from the EGFP&#x02013;&#x003b3;-tubulin would not contribute to give a significant fold difference. Background subtraction of EGFP-H2B signal was performed in areas not containing nuclei. Only cells that were imaged completely within the <italic>x,y,z</italic> plane of the acquisition were used for quantitation. Statistical significance was determined by the two-sided <italic>t</italic>-test (95&#x00025; confidence interval). </p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="sv001"><label>Video S1</label><caption><title>Time-Lapse Microscopy of vHMECs during Mitosis with a Bipolar Spindle Organized by Two Centrosomes</title><p>Time-lapse microscopy of early-passage vHMECs (RM18 &#x0005b;13 to 33 PD&#x0005d;) that express EGFP&#x02013;&#x003b3;-tubulin (green) and EGFP-H2B (green) during mitotic progression of cells that divide into two nuclei with two centrosomes (+HU &#x02192; release; bipolar, two centrosomes).

The p16 <sup>INK4a</sup> protein inhibits the G1 kinase activity of the cyclinD1-Cdk4 complex by binding to Cdk4 and preventing its association with cyclinD1, thereby preventing transcriptional activation of the Cdk2 binding partners cyclin E/A (Mechanism 1). The p21 kinase inhibitor is required for assembly of and stabilization of the cyclinD1-Cdk4 complex. In the presence of p16 <sup>INK4a</sup>, the cyclinD1-Cdk4 complex is disrupted, causing p21 to be released. When p21 accumulates to a critical threshold, it can bind to and inhibit the late G1 and S phase kinase activity of the cylinE/A-Cdk2 complex (Mechanism 2). </p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pbio.0040051.g008"/></fig></sec><fn-group><fn id="n1" fn-type="con"><p><bold>Author contributions.</bold> KMM and TDT conceived and designed the experiments.
