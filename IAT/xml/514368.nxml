Yeast two-hybrid analysis using the ligand-binding domain (LBD) of TAK1 as bait identified a novel TAK1-interacting protein, referred to as TIP27, which functions as a repressor of TAK1-mediated transactivation. TIP27 is a 27 kDa protein containing two zinc finger motifs. Mammalian two-hybrid analysis showed that TIP27 interacts specifically with TAK1 and not with several other nuclear receptors tested. The region between Asp<sup>39</sup> and Lys<sup>79</sup> of TIP27, referred to as TAK1-interaction domain (TID), is critical for its interaction with TAK1 while the TAK1-LBD from helix 3 until the C-terminus is required for the optimal interaction with TIP27. Pull-down assays demonstrated that the TIP27 physically interacts with TAK1 and supported the critical importance of the TID. Confocal microscopy showed that in the nucleus, TIP27 and TAK1 co-localize. TIP27 acts as a strong repressor of DR1-dependent transcriptional activation by TAK1. This repression does not involve the inhibition of TAK1 homodimerization or DR1 binding but may be due to an effect on co-activator recruitment by TAK1. Our results indicate that TIP27 functions as a TAK1-selective repressor.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes id="N0x8ca6da8.0x99f2e68" notes-type="data_link"><p>DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank accession no.

TAK1 exhibits a typical nuclear receptor modular structure consisting of an N-terminal domain, a DNA-binding domain (DBD), a hinge domain and a ligand-binding domain (LBD) composed of a canonical structure of 12 helical regions (H1&#x02013;H12) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh741c5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh741c7">7</xref>).</p><p>TAK1 is expressed in many tissues, including brain, thymus, testis and spleen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh741c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh741c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh741c8">8</xref>). TAK1 is differentially regulated during spermatogenesis and in particular highly expressed in pachytene spermatocytes. In the brain, its expression is limited to specific regions, including hippocampus, thalamus, dentate gyrus and the granule cells of the cerebellum. TAK1 is also highly expressed in hematopoietic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh741c9">9</xref>). Ectopic expression of TAK1 induces proliferation of promyelocytes thereby implicating TAK1 in the regulation of differentiation and proliferation of myeloid progenitor cells. This action, however, appears to be independent of the DBD of TAK1.</p><p>TAK1 binds as a homodimer to DNA response elements consisting of direct repeats of the consensus sequence AGGTCA spanned by 1&#x02013;5 nt (DR1&#x02013;5) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh741c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh741c11">11</xref>). The homodimers bind with highest affinity to DNA elements containing a DR1. Although TAK1 does not form heterodimers with retinoid X receptor (RXR), it is able to form a dimeric complex with TR2 and the androgen receptor (AR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh741c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh741c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh741c12">12</xref>). The transcriptional activity of TAK1 is cell type dependent; in certain cell types TAK1 can induce DR1-dependent transcription while in other cell types it represses transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh741c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh741c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh741c11">11</xref>). In addition, TAK1 is able to repress the transcriptional activation induced by several other nuclear receptors, including the peroxisome proliferator-activator receptor (PPAR), vitamin D receptor (VDR), RXR and retinoic acid receptor (RAR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh741c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh741c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh741c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh741c13">13</xref>). This repression appears to be mediated at least in part by competition for the same response element. Steroid 21-hydrolase, the erythroid &#x003b5;- and &#x003b3;-globin genes, and several viral promoters have been identified as potential targets for TAK1 regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh741c14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh741c17">17</xref>).</p><p>Recruitment of co-repressors and co-activators is a critical step in nuclear receptor-mediated repression and activation of gene expression, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh741c18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh741c21">21</xref>). Through their histone deacetylase or acetylase activities, respectively, such complexes induce changes in chromatin structure. The insight obtained into the action of other nuclear receptors suggests that the transcriptional regulation by TAK1 also involves recruitment of various transcription intermediary factors. This is supported by a recent study showing that TAK1 and TR2 are part of a 540 kDa repressor complex bound to a DR1 element in the erythroid &#x003b5;- and &#x003b3;-globin genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh741c17">17</xref>). However, very little is known about the identity of the proteins associated with this complex.</p><p>To identify proteins that modulate or mediate the regulation of transcription by TAK1, we performed yeast two-hybrid analysis using the hinge-LBD region of TAK1 as bait. In this study, we describe the identification of a protein that specifically interacts with TAK1. This protein, referred to as TAK1-interacting protein 27 (TIP27), is a 27 kDa nuclear protein containing two putative zinc finger motifs. TIP27 was found to be identical to the recently described JAZF1, a protein with unknown function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh741c22">22</xref>). TIP27 mRNA is found in several tissues and is most highly expressed in testis. Pull-down analysis demonstrated that TAK1 and TIP27 form a protein complex. Deletion mutation analyses identified a 40 amino acid TAK1-interaction domain (TID), i.e. critical for the interaction of TIP27 with TAK1 while the LBD of TAK1 is important in its interaction with TIP27. Reporter gene analyses showed that TIP27 is a strong repressor of the induction of DR1-dependent transactivation by TAK1 while TIP27 has little effect on the transcriptional activation by the nuclear receptors PPAR&#x003b1; and ROR&#x003b3;. This repression does not involve an inhibition of TAK1 homodimerization or DR1-binding but may be due to an effect on co-activator recruitment by TAK1. Our results suggest that TIP27 functions as a TAK1-selective co-factor that may play an important role in mediating transcriptional repression by TAK1.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plasmids</title><p>The reporter plasmid pFR-LUC was obtained from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA).

McDonnell (Duke University) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh741c26">26</xref>). Full-length and deletion mutants of pVP16-TAK1, pM-TAK1 or pM-TIP27 were created by placing each fragment in-frame with VP16(AD) or Gal4(DBD), respectively. These fragments were generated by PCR using TAK1- or TIP27-specific 5&#x02032;- and 3&#x02032;-primers to allow the PCR fragments to be subcloned into the multiple cloning site of each vector. Details on the length of each deletion are described in the text and figure legends. Point mutations in VP16-TAK1 and pM-TIP27 were introduced using a QuickChange site directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene). pcDNA4-TIP27 was generated by inserting a full-length TIP27 cDNA that was obtained by PCR using the expressed sequence tag clone BG699065 as a template, into the BamHI&#x0002f;EcoRI sites of pcDNA4HisMaxA. pCMV-Myc-TIP27 and pCMV-Myc-TIP27(&#x00394;TID) were generated by subcloning PCR-amplified TIP27 full-length and TIP27(&#x00394;TID) into EcoRI&#x0002f;NotI and BglII&#x0002f;SalI sites of pCMV-Myc (BD Biosciences), respectively. pEGFP-TIP27 was generated by cloning full-length TIP27 in-frame into the EcoRI and SalI sites of pEGFP-N2 (BD Biosciences). pET41-TIP27 encoding the GST-TIP27 fusion protein was created by PCR amplification of the full-length coding region and insertion into the BamHI&#x0002f;NotI sites of pET41c (Novagen, Madison, WI). pGEX-TIP27(&#x00394;C101) containing the N-terminus up to Pro<sup>101</sup>, pGEX-TIP27(39-101) encoding TIP27 from Asp<sup>39</sup> to Pro<sup>101</sup> and pGEX-TIP27(&#x00394;N79) containing the C-terminus from Lys<sup>79</sup> were created by PCR amplification and PCR products inserted in-frame into the BamHI&#x0002f;EcoRI sites of pGEX-5X-3 (Amersham).

After 3 h of incubation, cells were collected, resuspended in BugBuster protein extraction reagent (Novagen) and incubated as described in the manufacturer's protocol. Cellular extracts were then centrifuged at 15&#x02009;000 <italic>g</italic> and the supernatants containing the soluble GST proteins were collected. Equal amounts of GST-TIP27 proteins or GST protein (Sigma, St Louis, MO) were incubated with glutathione&#x02013;Sepharose 4B beads and washed in phosphate-buffered saline.

The resin was then washed five times with binding buffer. The pulled-down protein complexes were then examined by western-blot analysis using an anti-myc (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA).

In certain instances, pEGFP-TIP27 was co-transfected into COS-1 together with p3XFlag-CMV-TAK1 or p3XFlag-ROR&#x003b3;. After 24 h, cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde. For cells co-transfected with p3XFlag-CMV-TAK1 or p3XFlag-CMV-ROR&#x003b3;, immunofluorescent staining was performed by incubating cells with anti-FLAG M2 monoclonal antibody (Sigma) followed by incubation with Alexa Fluor&#x000ae; 594 goat anti-mouse antibody (Molecular Probes).

Since a number of well-established co-modulators of nuclear receptors did not interact with TAK1 (T. Nakajima and A.M. Jetten, unpublished data), we began to identify proteins that influence or mediate the transcriptional regulation by TAK1. To identify TAK1-interacting proteins, we performed yeast two-hybrid analysis using the hinge-LBD region of TAK1 as bait. A total of unique yeast clones were obtained that induced high &#x003b2;-galactosidase reporter activity in yeast two-hybrid analysis. One of these clones, encoding a novel TAK1-interacting protein referred to as TIP27 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh741f1">1</xref>A), was selected for further study.</p><p>The <italic>TIP27</italic> gene encodes an mRNA of &#x0223c;3.1 kb and a basic protein with a molecular mass of 27.1 kDa (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh741f1">1</xref>A) and a pI of 8.83. MotifScan and ScanProsite identified two putative zinc finger motifs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh741f1">1</xref>A) with the consensus sequence CX<sub>4</sub>CX<sub>12</sub>HX<sub>4</sub>H, one at the N-terminus between Cys<sup>14</sup> and His<sup>37</sup> (ZF1), and one at the C-terminus between Cys<sup>175</sup> and His<sup>198</sup> (ZF1). A third putative zinc finger motif (ZF3; CXCX<sub>12</sub>HX<sub>4</sub>H) was observed between Cys<sup>210</sup> and His<sup>230</sup>. In addition, TIP27 contains a Glu&#x0002f;Asp-rich region between Glu<sup>131</sup> and Glu<sup>146</sup>. TIP27 was found to be identical to the recently described JAZF1, a protein with unknown function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh741c22">22</xref>). The human TIP27 sequence exhibited high homology (98% identity at the amino acid level) with an unpublished mouse sequence (GenBank accession no. AK050474) representing the mouse homolog of TIP27. In addition, the N- and C-termini of TIP27 containing, respectively, the first and second zinc finger motifs of TIP27 exhibit high homology with a hypothetical <italic>Drosophila</italic> protein (GenBank accession no. NP&#x0005f;651853), which suggests that it might be the <italic>Drosophila</italic> homolog of TIP27 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh741f1">1</xref>B). The zinc finger motifs of TIP27 did not show homology with other zinc finger proteins.</p></sec><sec><title>Tissue-specific expression of TIP27</title><p>To examine the pattern of tissue-specific expression of TIP27, northern-blot analysis was performed using RNA from several human tissues (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh741f2">2</xref>). TIP27 mRNA was most highly expressed in adult testis, at moderate levels in colon, placenta, prostate and ovary, and at low levels in several other tissues. In testis, the radiolabeled TIP27 probe hybridized to two major transcripts 3.2 and 0.9 kb in size while other tissues contained mainly the 3.2 kb transcript. The 3.2 kb TIP27 transcript (GenBank accession no. AY372319) contains a 2.1 kb 3&#x02032;-untranslated region (3&#x02032;-UTR). The 115 bp of 5&#x02032;-UTR sequence contains a stop codon at 64 nt in agreement with our conclusion that &#x02018;MTGI&#x02026;&#x02019; is the N-terminus of TIP27 and that the 3.1 kb transcript encodes the full-length TIP27 protein.</p></sec><sec><title>TIP27 interacts selectively with TAK1</title><p>Since TIP27 was identified by yeast two-hybrid analysis, we examined its interaction with TAK1 by mammalian two-hybrid analysis. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh741f3">3</xref>, co-transfection of pM-TIP27 and VP16-TAK1 into CV-1 cells greatly enhanced (UAS)<sub>5</sub>-driven LUC reporter activity confirming the interaction between these two proteins observed in yeast two-hybrid analysis. To examine the specificity of this interaction, we determined whether TIP27 was able to interact with the LBD of several other nuclear receptors, including AR, estrogen receptor &#x003b1; (ER&#x003b1;), progesterone receptor (PR), liver X receptor &#x003b1; (LXR&#x003b1;), PPAR&#x003b3;, RXR&#x003b1;, retinoid-related testis-specific receptor (RTR or GCNF) and retinoid-related orphan receptor &#x003b3; (ROR&#x003b3;). AR, ER&#x003b1;, PR, PPAR&#x003b3;, LXR&#x003b1; and RXR&#x003b1; were analyzed in the presence and absence of their respective ligand. A small, ligand-independent increase in pM-TIP27-mediated reporter activity was observed when VP16-PPAR&#x003b3;(LBD) or VP16-RXR&#x003b1;(LBD) was co-transfected into the cells suggesting a weak interaction between TIP27 and these receptors (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh741f3">3</xref>). Increasing levels of VP16-PPAR&#x003b3;(LBD) did not further enhance reporter activity (data not shown). The LBD of the other receptors analyzed did not show any substantial interaction with TIP27, either in the presence or in the absence of ligand indicating that the interaction of TIP27 is rather selective for the LBD of TAK1. However, we cannot rule out that for some nuclear receptors TIP27 might interact with regions outside the LBD. In addition, the recruitment of TIP27 by nuclear receptors may depend on the promoter context of the target gene.</p><p>To determine what region in TAK1 is important for its interaction with TIP27, the effect of various TAK1 deletion and point mutations on this interaction was examined. N-terminal deletions up to Gly<sup>361</sup> had little effect on this interaction; however, deletion up to Ile<sup>451</sup> dramatically reduced reporter activity indicating that the H3&#x02013;5 region within the LBD of TAK1 is required for its interaction with TIP27 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh741f4">4</xref>). Deletion of 14 amino acids at the C-terminus, as in VP16-TAK1(&#x00394;C582) removes part of the putative activation function 2 (AF2; <sup>579</sup>ILKMETA; helix 12), caused a 85% reduction in transactivation while transactivation is almost totally abolished in VP16-(TAK1(&#x00394;C533). Mutating Ile<sup>576</sup> in H12 to Asn decreased reporter activity by 50% (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh741f4">4</xref>). These results suggest that the TAK1 LBD from H3 until the C-terminus is required for optimal interaction with TIP27.</p></sec><sec><title>Identification of the TID</title><p>To identify the region within TIP27 required for its interaction with TAK1, we examined the ability of several TIP27 deletion mutants to interact with TAK1. Deletion of the N-terminus up to Asp<sup>39</sup>, which contains the first zinc finger motif, rather increased than reduced reporter activity (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh741f5">5</xref>A). However, deletion up to Ser<sup>59</sup> totally abolished the interaction between TIP27 and TAK1 suggesting that the region between Asp<sup>39</sup> and Ser<sup>59</sup> is required for this interaction. To further identify this region, the effect of C-terminal deletions on TIP27 interaction with TAK1 was investigated. C-terminal deletions up to Lys<sup>79</sup> had little effect while deletion up to Ser<sup>59</sup> greatly reduced the interaction with TAK1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh741f5">5</xref>A). These results indicate that the region between Asp<sup>39</sup> and Lys<sup>79</sup>, referred to as TAK1 interaction domain or TID, is critical for the interaction of TIP27 with TAK1.</p><p>To further characterize this TID, the effects of additional deletion and point mutations within the TID on the interaction of TIP27 with TAK1 were examined. This analysis showed that TIP27(39-101) and TIP27(39-79) were able to induce reporter activity in mammalian two-hybrid analysis whereas TIP27(59-101) and TIP27(59-79) did not (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh741f5">5</xref>B). In addition, TIP27(&#x00394;TID) lacking the TID did not induce reporter activity. These effects of these deletion mutations are in agreement with our conclusion that TID is localized between Asp<sup>39</sup> and Lys<sup>79</sup> and required for the interaction with TAK1. We next examined the effect of four point mutations within the TID on the interaction of TIP27 with TAK1. The point mutations K<sup>47</sup>P, L<sup>76</sup>P and A<sup>69</sup>P potentially disrupt the two main &#x003b1;-helices contained within the TID while the point mutation Y<sup>60</sup>D might disrupt potential phosphorylation of this tyrosine. The point mutation Y<sup>60</sup>D almost totally abolished the interaction between TIP27 and TAK1 while L<sup>76</sup>P reduced reporter activity &#x0223c;40% (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh741f5">5</xref>B). This observation suggests that these amino acids are important in TIP27&#x0002f;TAK1 interactions and may function either as a structural determinant or as a target for phosphorylation. The point mutations K<sup>47</sup>P and A<sup>69</sup>P had little effect on the TIP27&#x0002f;TAK1 interaction.</p></sec><sec><title>TIP27 interacts with TAK1 <italic>in vitro</italic></title><p>To determine whether TAK1 and TIP27 physically interact, we performed pull-down assays using GST-TIP27 and <sup>32</sup>S-labeled TAK1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh741f6">6</xref>). As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh741f6">6</xref>B, GST-TIP27 was able to pull down TAK1. No TAK1 band was observed in the control (GST only). Pull-down assays with the TIP27 deletion mutants TIP27(&#x00394;C101) and TIP27(39-101), which still contain the TID, showed that both deletion mutants were able to pull down TAK1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh741f6">6</xref>C). These GST-TIP27 proteins did not pull down the nuclear receptor RTR, which was shown in mammalian two-hybrid analysis not to interact with TIP27. GST-TIP279(&#x00394;N79), lacking the TID, did not pull down TAK1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh741f6">6</xref>C). These results indicate that TAK1 and TIP27 physically interact and are in agreement with the conclusion that this interaction requires the TID of TIP27 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh741f5">5</xref>).</p><p>To determine whether TAK1 and TIP27 form a complex in intact cells, we expressed Flag-TAK1 and myc-TIP27 fusion proteins in COS-1 cells and performed IP analysis with isolated protein lysates prepared from transfected cells. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh741f6">6</xref>D, Flag-TAK1 was able to pull down myc-TIP27 suggesting that in intact cells the two proteins are in a complex with each other. Flag-TAK1 did not pull down TIP27 lacking the TID (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh741f6">6</xref>D) while Flag-ROR&#x003b3;, a receptor unable to interact with TIP27, was unable to pull down TIP27 (data not shown). A similar result was obtained with Flag-PPAR&#x003b3; (data not shown). These results indicate the importance of the TID and the selectivity of the TIP27&#x0002f;TAK1 interaction.</p></sec><sec><title>Subcellular localization</title><p>ScanProsite and PFSCAN analysis indicated the presence of a putative nuclear localization signal (NLS) at Pro<sup>178</sup>-Tyr<sup>184</sup> that is contained within the second zinc finger motif. To examine the subcellular localization of TIP27, COS-1 cells were transfected with pEGFP-TIP27 and 30 h later the subcellular distribution of EGFP-TIP27 was analyzed by confocal microscopy. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh741f7">7</xref>A shows that the full-length TIP27 protein localized to the nucleus. In more than 90% of COS-1 cells, TIP27 was detected predominantly in the nucleus and in most cells excluded from the nucleoli. Its punctated pattern suggests that it is associated with a larger nuclear complex.</p></sec><sec><title>Co-localization of TIP27 and TAK1</title><p>To examine the co-localization of TIP27 and TAK1, COS-1 cells were co-transfected with pEGFP-TIP27 and p3XFlag-CMV-TAK1. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh741f7">7</xref>B&#x02013;E, both TIP27 and TAK1 were expressed in the nucleus in a very similar punctated pattern (see arrows). These results support the conclusion that in cells TIP27 and TAK1 are part of the same protein complex. No co-localization of TIP27 was observed with the nuclear orphan receptor Flag-ROR&#x003b3; (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Inhibition of TAK1-induced transcription by TIP27</title><p>Transcriptional activation by TAK1 is mediated through binding to a DR1 response element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh741c10">10</xref>). This transactivation has been reported to be cell type-dependent; TAK1 is able to induce transcriptional activation in COS-1 cells but not in CV-1 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh741c29">29</xref>). To determine the function of TIP27, we examined its effect on the induction of TAK1-mediated transcription in COS-1 cells. For this purpose, cells were co-transfected with pSG5-TAK1 and pcDNA-TIP27 expression vectors and a (DR1)<sub>3</sub>-CAT reporter. Transfection with pSG-TAK1 alone caused a 6.5-fold induction of DR1-dependent transcriptional activation while transfection with pcDNA-TIP27 alone had little effect on basal transcription (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh741f8">8</xref>A). However, co-transfection with increasing amounts of pcDNA-TIP27 effectively repressed TAK1-mediated induction of transcription (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh741f8">8</xref>A). In contrast, TIP27(&#x00394;TID) had little effect on TAK1-mediated transactivation. In addition, expression of TIP27 had only a minor effect on the transcriptional activation induced by the nuclear receptors ROR&#x003b3; and PPAR&#x003b1; suggesting that effect of TIP27 on transcription is highly selective for TAK1 and appears not to be mediated through a general effect on transcription (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh741f8">8</xref>B).</p><p>Previous studies have shown that TAK1 binds as a homodimer to DR1 response elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh741c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh741c11">11</xref>). Therefore, the repression by TIP27 could be due to an inhibition of TAK1 homodimerization or the binding of TAK1 to DR1 response elements. To analyze the effect of TIP27 on homodimerization, we carried out mammalian two-hybrid analysis with Gal4(DBD)-TAK1 and VP16(AD)-TAK1. Homodimerization of TAK1 would lead to increased transactivation of the reporter through the activation domain (AD) of VP16. For this purpose, pM-TAK1 and VP16-TAK1 were co-transfected with (UAS)<sub>5</sub>-LUC into CV-1 cells in the presence or absence of pcDNA-TIP27. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh741f8">8</xref>C, TIP27 did not inhibit Gal4(DBD)-TAK1 and VP16(AD)-TAK1 mediated transactivation. These results indicate that transcriptional activation through VP16 appeared not to be affected by TIP27 in agreement with the conclusion that repression by TIP27 is very selective for TAK1. In addition, these results suggest that TIP27 did not affect TAK1 homodimerization. Because VP16(AD)-mediated transactivation was not affected by TIP27, we were able to examine the effect of TIP27 on the binding of VP16-TAK1 to the TAK1 (DR1) response element. For this purpose, VP16-TAK1 and (DR1)<sub>3</sub>-CAT were co-transfected into COS-1 cells with or without pcDNA-TIP27. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh741f8">8</xref>D, VP16-TAK1 caused a 10-fold increase in DR1-dependent transcriptional activation. TIP27 had little effect on this transactivation suggesting that it does not affect the binding of TAK1 to DR1.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In this study, we describe the identification of a novel TAK1-interacting protein, referred to as TIP27, which functions as a co-repressor for the nuclear orphan receptor TAK1. TIP27 is highly conserved (98%) between mouse and human and contains three putative C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>-type zinc finger motifs. These motifs exhibit little homology with zinc fingers found in other mammalian zinc finger protein families; however, the regions at the N- and C-termini of TIP27 including the zinc finger motifs displayed high homology with two regions in an unpublished <italic>Drosophila</italic> protein identified in the GenBank database (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh741f1">1</xref>B). We hypothesize that this protein is the <italic>Drosophila</italic> homolog of TIP27. Examination of the subcellular localization of TIP27 showed that it localizes to the nucleus in a punctated pattern suggesting that it is part of a larger protein complex. These observations are in agreement with the hypothesis that TIP27 functions as co-modulator of TAK1.</p><p>TIP27 is expressed in several tissues, including placenta, colon, prostate and testis. As TAK1, TIP27 mRNA is most abundant in adult human testis where it is expressed as a 0.9 and 3.2 kb transcript. The smaller mRNA is restricted to the testis while all other tissues analyzed contain only the larger transcript. The generation of multiple and unique transcripts in the testis is not limited to TIP27 but has been reported for many genes, including TAK1 and RTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh741c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh741c30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh741c32">32</xref>). These transcripts can be generated by alternative splicing, the testis-specific use of alternative promoter and transcription start sites, or the selection of alternative polyadenylation signals. Preliminary results have indicated that in testis the different TIP27 transcripts are generated by the use of different polyadenylation signals. Previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh741c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh741c8">8</xref>) have shown that TAK1 mRNA was most abundant in pachytene spermatocytes and expressed at lower levels in round spermatids. <italic>In situ</italic> hybridization analysis has shown that in testis TIP27 is also most highly expressed in pachytene spermatocytes and round spermatids (unpublished data). These observations suggest that in the testis the expression of TIP27 and TAK1 overlap. The observed co-expression is in agreement with the proposed functional relationship between these two proteins.</p><p>Recruitment of co-activators and co-repressors is a critical step in, respectively, nuclear receptor-mediated activation and repression of gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh741c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh741c28">28</xref>). This likely also applies to the activation and repressor functions of TAK1. However, several known co-activators and co-repressors, including NCoA1, NCoA2, PGC-1&#x003b1;, NCoR1 and NCoR2, that have been reported to interact with many nuclear receptors, do not appear to interact with TAK1 (T. Nakajima and A.M. Jetten, unpublished data). These observations suggest that in this regard, TAK1 behaves like an atypical receptor and, therefore, may recruit other co-activators and co-repressors that have specificity for TAK1. The identification of TIP27 as a selective modulator of TAK1, appears to support this conclusion. Both mammalian two-hybrid and pull-down analyses showed that the TIP27 gene encodes a protein that interacts selectively with the nuclear receptor TAK1. Confocal microscopy demonstrated that in the nucleus TAK1 and TIP27 co-localize suggesting that they are part of the same protein complex. Moreover, <italic>in vitro</italic> pull-down analysis indicated that TIP27 interacts directly with TAK1 while it did not bind the nuclear orphan receptor RTR. In many nuclear receptors helices 3&#x02013;5 together with helix 12 in the LBD form a hydrophobic cleft and patch clamp that serve as an interaction surface for co-repressors and co-activators. Deletion mutant analyses demonstrated that deletion of the helix 3&#x02013;5 region or the putative AF2 domain (helix 12; <sup>579</sup>ILKMETA) of TAK1 dramatically reduces its interaction with TIP27 suggesting that TIP27 interacts with the LBD of TAK1 and that helix 3&#x02013;5 and helix 12 are required for optimal interaction.</p><p>Deletion and point mutation analyses identified a 40 amino acid long region from Asp<sup>39</sup> to Lys<sup>79</sup>, referred to as the TID, as being critical for the interaction of TIP27 with TAK1. Deletion of this region and the point mutation Y<sup>60</sup>D within the TID abolished the interaction of TIP27 with TAK1. As demonstrated for the interaction of nuclear receptor with other co-repressors, the interaction of TIP27 is dependent on the LBD of the receptor. The binding of several co-activators and co-repressors are mediated by a &#x003b1;-helix containing an LXXLL or I&#x0002f;LXXII consensus motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh741c33">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh741c37">37</xref>). The co-repressor RIP140 interacts with nuclear receptors through LXXLL &#x003b1;-helix motifs, while other co-repressors, such as NCoR1 and NCoR2, bind receptors through a related motif with the consensus I&#x0002f;LXXII. Although the TID of TIP27 contains several &#x003b1;-helices (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh741f1">1</xref>A), it lacks the LXXLL or I&#x0002f;LXXII consensus sequence suggesting that the interaction TIP27 with TAK1 may involve a different interaction motif.</p><p>In addition to the TID, TIP27 contains three putative zinc finger motifs and a Glu&#x0002f;Asp-rich region. Zinc finger motifs have been involved in protein&#x02013;protein as well as protein&#x02013;DNA interactions. We speculate that the zinc finger domains and the Glu&#x0002f;Asp-rich region within TIP27 might play a role in the recruitment of other nuclear proteins to the TAK1&#x02013;TIP27 complex. Alternatively, TIP27 might have additional roles, such as functioning as a transcription factor itself. Its zinc finger motifs could therefore be involved in the recognition of specific DNA motifs. Future studies are needed to establish the function of these domains.</p><p>Study of the function of TIP27 demonstrated that TIP27 almost totally abolished the induction of DR1-dependent transcription by TAK1 in COS-1 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh741f8">8</xref>A). VP16-, ROR&#x003b3;- and PPAR&#x003b1;-mediated transactivation were not or only slightly affected by TIP27 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh741f8">8</xref>B and D). These results suggest that TIP27 is a rather specific repressor of TAK1-mediated transcriptional activation and not a general repressor of transcription. Deletion of the TID within TIP27 totally abrogates its repressor activity in agreement with our observations that this domain is required for TIP27&#x0002f;TAK1 interactions. Since the <italic>in vitro</italic> pull-down analysis showed that TIP27 interacts directly with TAK1, the repression of TAK1-mediated transactivation by TIP27 could be mediated through an inhibition of TAK1 homodimerization or the binding of TAK1 to its DNA response element DR1. However, the results presented in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh741f8">8</xref>C and D indicate that TIP27 does not inhibit TAK1 homodimerization and does not prevent the binding of TAK1 to DR1. Therefore, the mechanism by which TIP27 represses TAK1-mediated transactivation, differs significantly from that of the recently described TR4(TAK1)-associated protein TRA16, which exhibits no sequence similarity with TIP27 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh741c29">29</xref>). The repression of TAK1-mediated transactivation by TRA16 involves an inhibition in TAK1 homodimerization and binding of TAK1 to its DNA response element DR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh741c29">29</xref>). In addition, in contrast to TRA16, the interaction of TIP27 with TAK1 requires the LBD of TAK1 and is independent of its DBD.</p><p>Since TIP27 does not inhibit TAK1 homodimerization or DR1 binding, the repression of TAK1-mediated transactivation by TIP27 might involve inhibition of co-activator recruitment. Such a mechanism has been proposed for the inhibition of nuclear receptor-induced transcription by the co-repressor RIP140 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh741c38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh741c39">39</xref>). Binding of RIP140 to nuclear receptors competes with the recruitment of co-activators, such as NCoA1 and PGC-1&#x003b1;, and promotes the recruitment of histone deacetylases. However, it is not yet possible to test this hypothesis since several known co-activators, including NCoA1 and PGC-1&#x003b1;, are unable to interact with TAK1 (T. Nakajima and A.M. Jetten, unpublished data) and no other co-activators that interact with TAK1 have yet been identified. We are in the process of determining whether other TAK1-interacting proteins identified in our yeast two-hybrid screen function as co-activators of TAK1.</p><p>In summary, in this study we describe the identification of TIP27 as a novel nuclear modulator of the nuclear orphan receptor TAK1. Mammalian two-hybrid and pull-down analyses indicate that TIP27 interacts rather specifically with the LBD of the nuclear orphan receptor TAK1 and identify TID as a region within TIP27 that plays a critical role in the interaction of TIP27 with TAK1. Future studies have to determine the physiological function of TIP27 in the repression of gene transcription by TAK1.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkh741f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> (<bold>A</bold>) The amino acid sequence of human TIP27.
