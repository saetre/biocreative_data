We examined specific serum complement components in coordinating the activation of tumor suppressors p53 and WWOX (also named FOR or WOX1) and kinases ERK, JNK1 and STAT3 in human prostate DU145 cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>DU145 cells were cultured overnight in 1&#x00025; normal human serum, or in human serum depleted of an indicated complement protein. Under complement C1q- or C6-free conditions, WOX1 and ERK were mainly present in the cytoplasm without phosphorylation, whereas phosphorylated JNK1 was greatly accumulated in the nuclei. Exogenous C1q rapidly restored the WOX1 activation (with Tyr33 phosphorylation) in less than 2 hr. Without serum complement C9, p53 became activated, and hyaluronan (HA) reversed the effect. Under C6-free conditions, HA induced activation of STAT3, an enhancer of metastasis. Notably, exogenous C1q significantly induced apoptosis of WOX1-overexpressing DU145 cells, but not vehicle-expressing cells. A dominant negative and Y33R mutant of WOX1 blocked the apoptotic effect. C1q did not enhance p53-mediated apoptosis. By total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy, it was determined that C1q destabilized adherence of WOX1-expressing DU145 cells by partial detaching and inducing formation of clustered microvilli for focal adhesion particularly in between cells. These cells then underwent shrinkage, membrane blebbing and death. Remarkably, as determined by immunostaining, benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer were shown to have a significantly reduced expression of tissue C1q, compared to age-matched normal prostate tissues.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>We conclude that complement C1q may induce apoptosis of prostate cancer cells by activating WOX1 and destabilizing cell adhesion.

Nonetheless, the functional properties of each individual complement component are largely unknown. In this study, we have demonstrated for the first time that C1q is expressed in the prostate. Remarkably, C1q expression is significantly reduced in benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer. This event is critical for prostate cancer to grow and develop. Our supporting evidence is that complement C1q and C6 sustain the activation of tumor suppressor WOX1, which is needed for blocking cancer cell proliferation. WOX1 colocalizes with C1q in the basal and epithelial cells of prostate tissues. Functional significance of this regard remains to be established.</p><p>In cell model experiments, we determined that C1q activates ectopic WOX1 in killing DU145 cells. The sequential event is as follows: 1) Cells overexpressing WOX1 attach evenly onto the surface of cover glass (determined by TIRF microscopy), whereas approximately 50&#x00025; of cells may &#x0201c;tiptoe&#x0201d; on the glass surface via formation of microvilli for focal adhesion; 2) C1q dramatically increases the formation of microvilli as clusters in between cells. WOX1 can be found in both the focal adhesion areas and in the nuclei; 3) Cells then undergo shrinkage, membrane blebbing, nuclear condensation and DNA fragmentation. Exposure of phosphatidylserine (PS) on the cell surface is barely detectable, raising the question whether PS exposure is essential for C1q/WOX1-induced cell death.

The death event could be universal, as long as C1q and WOX1 are present in both the extracellular and intracellular milieu, and are sufficient in activating the apoptotic cascade. WOX1 is known to participate in the early event of apoptosis emanating from the membrane receptors (e.g. Fas or TNF receptor) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005755-Hong2">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>C1q rapidly induces accumulation of activated WOX1 in the nuclei in non-transfected DU145 cells in less than 2 hr.

Thus, under physiology conditions, serum C1q and C6 sustain optimal activation of WOX1 to maintain normal cell physiology.</p><p>We have recently shown that TGF-&#x003b2;1 may interact with membrane hyaluronidase 2 (Hyal-2), followed by recruiting WOX1 and the resulting WOX1/Hyal-2 complex relocation to the nuclei <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005755-Hsu1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>.

Most interestingly, in the absence of C9, serum causes nuclear accumulation of p53, suggesting that serum C9 controls p53 activation for regulating gene transcription <italic>in vivo</italic>.

This implies that cancer cell growth and invasion can be regulated by serum complement C1q, C6 and C9 via their regulation of the activation of tumor suppressor p53 and WOX1. In the absence of serum C1q and C6, JNK1 becomes constitutively activated, suggesting that C1q and C6 block JNK1 activation <italic>in vivo</italic>.

These observations indicate that C1q and C6 are likely to support alternatively splicing of <italic>WWOX</italic> mRNA, thus leading to the generation of WOX2 protein. Whether WOX2 acts as a tumor suppressor is unknown. Presumably, C1q and C6 are needed for serum-dependent cell survival by maintaining ERK activation and WOX2 expression. WOX2 may act as a dominant negative and counteracts the tumor suppressor function of wild type WWOX/WOX1 <italic>in vivo</italic>, thereby supporting cancer growth.

Our data showed that HA tends to increase p53 relocation to the cytoplasm, suggesting that p53 can readily undergo a rapid turnover by the ubiquitination/proteasomal system in the cytoplasm. Conceivably, this mechanism to reduce wild type p53 would help facilitate prostate cancer cell growth. Interestingly, HA stimulated p53 nuclear export, when DU145 cells were cultured under serum-free or C9-free conditions. In contrast, HA induces p53 nuclear import, when cells were grown in serum without C6.

Hyaluronidase digestion definitely causes changes in HA conformation, especially in patients with metastatic cancer.</p><p>In summary, we have presented a novel functional role of complement C1q and C6 in regulating the expression of WOX2 and activation of ERK, JNK1 and WOX1. Also, complement C9 controls nuclear localization or activation of p53. HA participates in cancer progression and metastasis, and also modulates the effects of C1q and C6, along with STAT3 activation. Our findings have apparently added a new feature of complement proteins in regulating cancer cell survival and progression. We believe that the serum environment, which contains complement proteins and circulating hyaluronan, affects the behavior of cancer cells and decides the best timing for these cells to invade. Apparently, global analysis for complement protein expression in cancer cells is needed to elucidate the crucial role of complement components in regulating cancer cell progression and metastasis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>DU145 cells, specific complement component-depleted human sera, antibodies, and cDNA expression constructs</title><p>Human prostate cancer cell line DU145 was cultured overnight under serum-free conditions, or in the presence of 0.5 or 1&#x00025; normal human serum (NHS), or &#x00394;C1q (C1q depleted; from Sigma-Aldrich and Quidel), &#x00394;C6 (C6 depleted; Quidel), &#x00394;C7 (C7 depleted; Quidel), &#x00394;C8 (C8 depleted; Quidel), or &#x00394;C9 serum (C9 depleted; Quidel).
