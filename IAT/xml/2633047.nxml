Despite the growing appreciation of the pathogenic mechanisms involved in familial forms of AD, much less is known about the sporadic cases. Aggregates found in both familial and sporadic AD often include proteins other than those typically associated with the disease. One such protein is a mutant form of ubiquitin, UBB&#x0002b;1, a frameshift product generated by molecular misreading of a wild-type ubiquitin gene. UBB&#x0002b;1 has been associated with multiple disorders. UBB&#x0002b;1 cannot function as a ubiquitin molecule, and it is itself a substrate for degradation by the ubiquitin/proteasome system (UPS). Accumulation of UBB&#x0002b;1 impairs the proteasome system and enhances toxic protein aggregation, ultimately resulting in cell death. Here, we describe a novel model system to investigate how UBB&#x0002b;1 impairs UPS function and whether it plays a causal role in protein aggregation. We expressed a protein analogous to UBB&#x0002b;1 in yeast (Ub<sup>ext</sup>) and demonstrated that it caused UPS impairment. Blocking ubiquitination of Ub<sup>ext</sup> or weakening its interactions with other ubiquitin-processing proteins reduced the UPS impairment. Expression of Ub<sup>ext</sup> altered the conjugation of wild-type ubiquitin to a UPS substrate. The expression of Ub<sup>ext</sup> markedly enhanced cellular susceptibility to toxic protein aggregates but, surprisingly, did not induce or alter nontoxic protein aggregates in yeast. Taken together, these results suggest that Ub<sup>ext</sup> interacts with more than one protein to elicit impairment of the UPS and affect protein aggregate toxicity. Furthermore, we suggest a model whereby chronic UPS impairment could inflict deleterious consequences on proper protein aggregate sequestration.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>The accumulation of cytotoxic protein aggregates occurs in many neurodegenerative diseases. It is difficult to determine if the protein aggregates found in these diseases represent a cause or consequence of the disorder. Degradation pathways, such as the ubiquitin/proteasome system (UPS), remove misfolded proteins that are prone to aggregate. The UPS involves many players that work in concert to target proteins for degradation by the proteasome. A mutant form of ubiquitin has been associated with many diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. We developed a yeast model of the mutant ubiquitin protein in order to investigate its effect on UPS function and protein aggregation. We demonstrate that this mutant ubiquitin causes impairment of the UPS and suggest that it does so by interacting with multiple components of the pathway. Using this model, we evaluated the effects of the mutant ubiquitin on nontoxic protein aggregates and found that they were unaltered by its presence. We demonstrate that the mutant ubiquitin acts as a modifier, which increases cellular susceptibility to the phenotypic effects of deleterious protein aggregates by altering UPS functionality and substrate ubiquitination. Furthermore, the system we developed can be utilized to further understand the complex interplay of proteasomal impairment and protein aggregate toxicity.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="19"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>As technology and medicine further extend the human lifespan, age-related diseases will become more prevalent. Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects 20 million people worldwide and is the most common form of late-onset dementia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000382-Goedert1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. The study of genetic mutations that cause early onset AD has provided insight into some of the factors involved, but most cases of AD are sporadic and of unknown origin. Uncovering the risk factors involved in any multi-factorial disease is challenging but vital for disease treatment and prevention. Many fundamental pathways, including the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS), have been suggested to play a role in AD. Therefore, investigating the relationship between AD and the UPS could lead to new therapeutic targets.</p><p>The UPS is an evolutionarily conserved pathway that selectively eliminates short-lived and damaged proteins. A number of cellular processes, including the cell cycle, stress response, and DNA repair, require the UPS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000382-Jentsch1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Protein degradation by the UPS involves a series of enzymes that ultimately attach ubiquitin, a small well-conserved protein, to an internal lysine residue in the target protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000382-Johnson1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000382-Schwartz1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Multiple ubiquitin proteins can be connected to form a polyubiquitin chain which serves as a degradation signal recognized by the 26S proteasome. A series of events involving E1, E2 and E3 enzymes are required to attach ubiquitin via its C-terminal glycine residue to the target protein. The formation of polyubiquitin chains and the process of ubiquitin conjugation to protein targets displays exquisite specificity, in part by the multitude of E2 and E3 enzymes. Despite intensive study, the roles of many components of the UPS remain to be elucidated.</p><p>The importance of the UPS in cellular homeostasis is apparent not only by the redundancy and conservation of the components, but also by its role in disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000382-Schwartz1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000382-Taylor1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. The complex interplay between protein aggregation and UPS function is easily appreciated, yet it is often difficult to determine the causal nature of the problem. UPS dysfunction can prevent the degradation of misfolded proteins, which can lead to aggregation. Conversely, protein aggregates can be challenging substrates for the UPS and can thus cause proteasomal impairment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000382-AlvesRodrigues1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Protein aggregation is a hallmark of many neurodegenerative disorders <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000382-Taylor1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, mutations in ubiquitin processing enzymes, such as UCHL1 and Parkin, can lead to inherited forms of neurodegenerative diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000382-Shimura1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000382-Maraganore1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, many protein aggregates associated with disease show ubiquitin deposition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000382-Ciechanover1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, suggesting that dysfunctional UPS activity may contribute to pathogenesis. Understanding the interplay between protein aggregation and clearance is an active area of research, but most systems are complicated by cellular toxicity, which alone can have negative consequences on protein homeostasis.</p><p>A mutant form of ubiquitin was found associated with AD and other diseases and was proposed to act as a natural proteasome inhibitor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000382-vanLeeuwen1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. The generation of this mutant ubiquitin protein is unusual - the mutation is found in the messenger RNA, but not in the DNA sequence of the ubiquitin-B gene. The mutant ubiquitin results from a dinucleotide deletion near the 3&#x02032; end of the mRNA transcript which shifts the reading frame for translation. The mutant protein has been named UBB&#x0002b;1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000382-vanLeeuwen2">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. The dinucleotide deletion event in the mRNA has been termed &#x0201c;molecular misreading&#x0201d;, though the mechanism by which the deletion occurs remains elusive <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000382-vanLeeuwen3">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000382-vanLeeuwen4">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Many human mRNA transcripts, including all copies of ubiquitin, contain potential sites for molecular misreading, since hotspots for these events are hypothesized to occur near simple repeat sequences (e.g. GAGAG) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000382-vanDenHurk1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. The best characterized &#x0002b;1 mutant ubiquitin protein has a short C-terminal extension, with the majority of the protein being identical to ubiquitin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000382-vanLeeuwen2">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. As such, the protein is presumably folded and recognized as ubiquitin, but the C-terminal glycine residue essential for conjugation to substrates is absent.</p><p>The accumulation of the UBB&#x0002b;1 protein in the neurological hallmarks of AD is curious, since the mutant cannot be conjugated to target proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000382-vanLeeuwen2">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. The presence of UBB&#x0002b;1 has been proposed to represent an endogenous readout of proteasomal dysfunction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000382-Hol1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000382-Fischer1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Due to its association with protein aggregation, it was also suggested that UBB&#x0002b;1 could contribute to disease pathology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000382-DeVrij1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. UBB&#x0002b;1 protein accumulation has been documented in multiple disorders such as polyglutamine expansion diseases (including Huntington's disease), Pick's disease and even non-neuronal tissue diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000382-vanLeeuwen1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000382-VanLeeuwen1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. However, the mechanism of UBB&#x0002b;1 action in these diseases remains unclear.</p><p>To evaluate the role of UBB&#x0002b;1 in disease, the effects of ectopic UBB&#x0002b;1 expression have been investigated in cultured mammalian cells. Although UBB&#x0002b;1 cannot be conjugated to target substrates, it can be ubiquitinated by wild type ubiquitin and degraded by the proteasome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000382-Lam1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. However, high levels of UBB&#x0002b;1 expression cause proteasomal impairment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000382-Hol1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000382-vanTijn1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000382-Lindsten1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. As a natural inhibitor of the UPS, UBB&#x0002b;1 could be another example whereby proteasomal impairment induces protein aggregation. Therefore, UBB&#x0002b;1 might act as a disease modifier. Recently, a UBB&#x0002b;1 transgenic mouse has been characterized <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000382-Fischer2">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. UBB&#x0002b;1 expression resulted in constant UPS impairment that caused a minor learning deficit and caused changes in transcription profiles that mirror those found in brains of humans with AD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000382-Fischer2">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. The expression of UBB&#x0002b;1 in mammalian cells enhances the toxicity and aggregation of an expanded polyglutamine protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000382-dePril1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. However, measuring changes in protein aggregation in cells that are dying from toxic protein aggregates is challenging. Hence, it remains to be determined if UBB&#x0002b;1 affects protein aggregation <italic>per se</italic>, or if it affects the ability of the cells to cope with the aggregates.</p><p>We developed a model system using <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> to evaluate the cellular effects of UBB&#x0002b;1. We expressed a mutant ubiquitin protein (Ub<sup>ext</sup>) analogous to UBB&#x0002b;1 and found that it caused UPS impairment in yeast. Furthermore, we found that Ub<sup>ext</sup> changed the ubiquitination pattern on a UPS substrate. Taking advantage of non-toxic protein aggregates in yeast, we demonstrated that the expression of Ub<sup>ext</sup> neither induced nor changed these aggregates. However, Ub<sup>ext</sup> did make cells more susceptible to toxic protein aggregates. We propose that Ub<sup>ext</sup> does not cause protein aggregation, but rather acts as a phenotypic enhancer of deleterious aggregation. We present a model based on our work and other recent advances in the field to explain how this might occur.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ub<sup>ext</sup> Expression in Yeast Cannot Functionally Rescue a Decrease in Wild Type Ubiquitin</title><p>The mechanism by which &#x0002b;1 proteins, such as UBB&#x0002b;1, are produced is currently unknown.

Cells expressing Ub<sup>ext</sup> exhibited a unique band which represents the extended mutant ubiquitin protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000382-g002">Figure 2B, grey arrow</xref>) which is larger than wild type ubiquitin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000382-g002">Figure 2B, arrowhead</xref>). Cells expressing Ub<sup>ext</sup> also displayed a distinctive laddering pattern which suggests that Ub<sup>ext</sup> is conjugated by wild type ubiquitin moieties (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000382-g002">Figure 2B, black arrows</xref>).

The fact that Ub<sup>ext</sup> caused lethality in the proteasome mutant strain and Ub<sup>ext</sup>-expressing cells accumulated ubiquitinated-protein conjugates, suggests that it is affecting protein degradation. An accumulation of high molecular weight ubiquitinated proteins also occurred with the over expression of wild type ubiquitin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000382-g002">Figure 2B, middle lane</xref>).

According to the N-end rule, R-&#x003b2;gal is an unstable protein that is polyubiquitinated and rapidly degraded by the 26S proteasome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000382-Varshavsky2">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. The UFD reporter substrate is Ub-P-<italic>LacZ</italic>. In yeast, no DUB can cleave ubiquitin from &#x003b2;gal if the first amino acid after ubiquitin is proline. Because of the ubiquitin fusion, Ub-P-&#x003b2;gal is unstable and is rapidly degraded by the proteasome. These constructs, along with a stable <italic>LacZ</italic> control (Ub-M-<italic>LacZ</italic>), were transformed into cells expressing Ub<sup>ext</sup> to assess UPS function by &#x003b2;gal activity assays. Cells expressing Ub<sup>ext</sup> and either of the unstable proteasome reporters displayed higher levels of specific &#x003b2;gal activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000382-g002">Figure 2C and 2D</xref>). Cells expressing extra wild type ubiquitin showed a slight increase in the stabilization of the reporter constructs. The expression of extra wild type ubiquitin also generated a large steady state population of ubiquitin-conjugated proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000382-g002">Figure 2B, middle lane</xref>), which could be taxing the degradation capacity of the proteasome. To evaluate if <italic>LacZ</italic> fusion expression was affected by Ub<sup>ext</sup>, stable M-&#x003b2;gal activity was measured and showed no difference (data not shown). These results demonstrate that the expression of Ub<sup>ext</sup> in yeast inhibits the degradation of two different UPS reporter substrates.</p><p>Such stabilization of the proteasome reporter constructs could be due to a lack of ubiquitination of the reporter, since the expression of Ub<sup>ext</sup> also causes accumulation of unconjugated wild type ubiquitin. The reporter substrates (&#x003b2;gal protein) were immunoprecipitated from cells with and without the co-expression of Ub<sup>ext</sup>. Western blot with an anti-&#x003b2;gal antibody revealed that more &#x003b2;-gal protein was precipitated in Ub<sup>ext</sup>-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000382-g002">Figure 2E, left</xref>).

Thus, the toxicity results from too much aggregation of Sup35p in the prion state. These toxic aggregates provide a means to assess the effects of aggregation of a protein of known function in combination with UPS dysfunction. Since most toxic protein aggregates cause cell death by unknown mechanisms, analyzing the Sup35p aggregates in &#x0005b;<italic>PSI&#x0002b;</italic>&#x0005d; cells provides a unique opportunity to dissect the contributions of the toxic protein aggregates and UPS dysfunction.

In light of the fact that the toxic protein aggregates are not ubiquitinated, we evaluated the ubiquitination pattern of the UPS reporters. To compare the ubiquitination of these constructs with and without the expression of Ub<sup>ext</sup>, we utilized a temperature-sensitive proteasome mutant strain (<italic>pre1-1 pre2-2</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000382-Heinemeyer1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>.

We demonstrated that the Ub<sup>ext</sup> mutant was not functional as ubiquitin and was not deleterious to the cells. Importantly, the expression of Ub<sup>ext</sup> in yeast caused impairment of the UPS. Since proteasome dysfunction can lead to protein aggregation, we were intrigued that the presence of Ub<sup>ext</sup> served to neither induce nor alter non-toxic protein aggregates in yeast. However, the expression of Ub<sup>ext</sup> rendered the cells more susceptible to toxic protein aggregates, and this could not be attributed to an increase in general stress elicited by Ub<sup>ext</sup>. We propose that the reduced UPS functionality and altered ubiquitination of UPS substrates in Ub<sup>ext</sup>-expressing cells creates an environment in which toxic amyloidogenic proteins either cannot join or are not maintained as large insoluble aggregates. As a result, protein aggregate toxicity is enhanced due to an increase in soluble or oligomeric toxic protein. Thus, this yeast model system revealed that Ub<sup>ext</sup> is a phenotypic modifier of toxic protein aggregates. This genetically tractable model provides a platform to further dissect how UBB&#x0002b;1 affects the cellular tolerance to toxic protein aggregates.</p><p>The mechanism of UPS impairment caused by UBB&#x0002b;1 is not well understood. We asked whether Ub<sup>ext</sup> causes a reduction in proteasome activity. Using an unstable ubiquitin-independent substrate (GFP-ODC) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000382-Hoyt1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>, we observed no significant change in the activity of the proteasome in Ub<sup>ext</sup>-expressing cells. Based on this result, we suggest that Ub<sup>ext</sup> is not clogging the core of the proteasome and propose that Ub<sup>ext</sup> is interacting with other components of the ubiquitin processing cascade or with the regulatory cap of the proteasome. We hypothesized that disrupting the interaction of Ub<sup>ext</sup> with component(s) of the ubiquitin processing pathway would alleviate the proteasomal impairment. Mutational analysis revealed that ubiquitin conjugation and the hydrophobic patch affect the extent to which Ub<sup>ext</sup> causes UPS impairment. Interestingly, the effects were distinct with different substrates. This supports the idea that Ub<sup>ext</sup> is interacting with multiple components of the UPS; reduction of its interaction via the hydrophobic patch or elimination of its ubiquitination weakened some of the observed effects but not others.</p><p>Previous studies have investigated the connection between UPS dysfunction and protein aggregation, especially in the context of protein conformational disorders <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000382-Lindsten2">&#x0005b;72&#x0005d;</xref>. It remains difficult, however, to discern the precise nature of the causal relationship between protein aggregation and proteasomal impairment. Evidence that UBB&#x0002b;1 and other disease-associated mutations in the UPS can cause proteasomal impairment and increase protein aggregation supports the idea that proteasome dysfunction plays a stimulatory role in protein aggregation. However, in some cases, such as that with mutant Parkin in familial Parkinson's Disease, decreased UPS function is not associated with protein aggregation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000382-Shimura1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. Using non-toxic protein aggregates in yeast, we have demonstrated that a UBB&#x0002b;1-like protein, Ub<sup>ext</sup>, neither induced nor changed protein aggregates. Our results provide evidence that a compromised UPS does not necessarily affect protein aggregation <italic>per se</italic> but can cause phenotypic effects by decreasing cellular tolerance to deleterious protein aggregates.</p><p>We hypothesize that Ub<sup>ext</sup> is altering the sequestration of aggregated proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000382-g009">Figure 9</xref>). Due to the altered substrate ubiquitination and the general UPS impairment caused by Ub<sup>ext</sup>, misfolded proteins are not efficiently degraded and somehow perturb the sequestration of amyloidogenic proteins into the insoluble aggregates which may have a protective function. How the UPS functionality plays a role in the ability of the cell to efficiently sequester non-ubiquitinated proteins remains to be elucidated. One recent study suggests that different cellular compartments retain aggregates of ubiquitinated and non-ubiquitinated proteins and a reduction in UPS activity can cause a change in this localization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000382-Kaganovich1">&#x0005b;69&#x0005d;</xref>. If proper localization of aggregated proteins protects the cell from smaller toxic oligomeric species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000382-Ferreira1">&#x0005b;73&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000382-Walsh1">&#x0005b;74&#x0005d;</xref>, then the inability of toxic oligomers to be efficiently sequestered would be deleterious (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000382-g009">Figure 9</xref>). Indeed, the expression of Ub<sup>ext</sup> resulted in an increase in the relative amount of soluble TOXIC-Q103 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000382-g010">Figure 10D</xref>) and the combination of Ub<sup>ext</sup> and TOXIC-Q103 was more deleterious to cell survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000382-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). Further evidence to support the idea that the redistribution of aggregates can lead to cell death comes from a recent report investigating the nature of the aggregates formed in response to the expression of expanded polyglutamine protein in yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000382-Wang1">&#x0005b;70&#x0005d;</xref>. A single large aggregate, an aggresome-like structure, was formed by polyglutamine proteins that were not toxic to the cells. When the large aggregate was unable to form, multiple small aggregates were observed and the appearance of these correlated with toxicity. Thus, the single large aggregate appears to be protective against polyglutamine protein aggregate toxicity. Among the cellular factors found that could disrupt the formation of the single aggregate when mutated were two ubiquitin-associated proteins. Furthermore, limiting general cellular ubiquitination by the <italic>uba1-204</italic> mutant also disrupted the formation of the large aggregate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000382-Wang1">&#x0005b;70&#x0005d;</xref>. We show that <italic>uba1-204</italic> enhanced the cellular toxicity of the toxic polyglutamine aggregates used in our study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000382-g010">Figure 10A</xref>). Taken together, the data support the proposed model of the effect of Ub<sup>ext</sup> on protein aggregate toxicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000382-g009">Figure 9</xref>).</p><p>Since Ub<sup>ext</sup> causes UPS impairment and a change in ubiquitination of substrates, this could cause the mis-handling or redistribution of some ubiquitin-conjugated proteins and hinder toxic protein aggregates from being rapidly sequestered, resulting in enhanced cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000382-g009">Figure 9</xref>). Thus, even though the toxic protein aggregates may not be substrates of the UPS, perturbations in the processing of normal UPS substrates may affect cellular tolerance to toxic aggregates. Our data suggest that all perturbations in the UPS are not equally potent at altering the cellular tolerance to toxic aggregates. Therefore, we conclude that the magnitude of the enhanced protein aggregate toxicity in the presence of the extended mutant ubiquitin is exceptional. This is likely due to its interactions with other proteins and supports further that UBB&#x0002b;1 may be a potent disease modifier.</p><p>Since protein conformational disorders result from a combination of cellular perturbations, often including the unknown affects of aging, then eliminating individual modifiers or enhancers may prove useful for disease therapy. Obviously, alleviating the primary causative agent, when known, could prove to be the most beneficial. For example, when we used the Sup35p toxic aggregate model we were able to rescue the Ub<sup>ext</sup>-enhanced toxicity by restoring the loss of function caused by Sup35p sequestration into aggregates. However, in many protein conformational diseases, the function of the proteins found in the aggregates and cellular toxicity is not understood. Therefore, investigating ways to alleviate the effects of known modifiers represents an important therapeutic avenue for disease treatment and prevention. The insight gained by developing a yeast model of UBB&#x0002b;1 has provided a means to further investigate the role of protein aggregate compartmentalization in toxicity, which may underlie some of the effects observed in cells or tissues experiencing chronic UPS impairment. The identification of UBB&#x0002b;1-interacting proteins may allow for the elucidation of the mechanism whereby a natural modifier of UPS function affects cellular tolerance to toxic protein aggregates.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Strains</title><p>Yeast strains were grown and manipulated by standard techniques <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000382-Guthrie1">&#x0005b;75&#x0005d;</xref>.
