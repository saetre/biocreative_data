Thus, the zebrafish provides a genetically tractable model system in which to study the molecular mechanisms of heart regeneration. </p><p>Zebrafish heart regeneration occurs over a 2-mo period &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040260-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;. After amputation, a blood clot forms to seal the ventricle and stop bleeding. The blood clot is replaced by a fibrin clot at 2 to 3 d postamputation (dpa). The regenerating myocardium is derived from cardiomyocytes surrounding the wound that reenter the cell cycle, presumably in response to signals from the wound &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040260-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;. Cardiomyocytes initiate DNA synthesis and proliferation at 7 dpa. Between 7 and 14 dpa, DNA synthesis and proliferation of cardiomyocytes reach a peak &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040260-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;. Nascent cardiomyocytes replace most of the lost ventricular tissue by 30 dpa, and the structure of the heart is fully restored at 60 dpa &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040260-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;. </p><p>Elucidating the molecular mechanism of zebrafish heart regeneration may provide insight into potential therapeutic approaches for heart injury in humans. In an effort to identify genes important for heart regeneration, we tested whether zebrafish mutants defective in fin regeneration also have heart regeneration defects. Two fin regeneration mutants, <italic>ncp</italic> &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040260-b008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040260-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d; and <italic>nbl</italic> &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040260-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;, are also defective for heart regeneration. <italic>ncp</italic> encodes the zebrafish <italic>monopolar spindle (mps) 1</italic> gene that is involved in mitotic checkpoint regulation &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040260-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;. <italic>nbl</italic> encodes the heat shock protein 60 (hsp60) chaperone protein &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040260-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;. Using a candidate gene approach, Raya et al. &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040260-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d; have identified a limited set of genes that are expressed during heart regeneration. Collectively, these studies reveal little information on the initiation and overall progression of heart regeneration, prompting us to take a more systematic approach. </p><p>In order to identify genes that are important for zebrafish heart regeneration, we utilized microarray technology to carry out gene expression profiling of regenerating hearts at 3, 7, and 14 dpa. Distinct gene clusters were identified according to their temporal expression patterns and were classified into different functional categories. Expression of genes encoding for wound response/inflammatory factors, secreted molecules, and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) increased in sequential patterns. Comparisons of gene expression profiles between regenerating hearts and fins suggest that these two processes share common molecules but also use tissue-specific factors. To identify signals that trigger regeneration, we focused our analysis on secreted molecules. <italic>platelet-derived growth factor-a (pdgf-a)</italic> and several other secreted molecules, including the previously unidentified <italic>pdgf-b,</italic> were upregulated in regenerating hearts. In primary cultures of adult zebrafish cardiomyocytes, PDGF-B homodimers induce DNA synthesis. In addition, treatment with a chemical inhibitor of PDGF receptor resulted in a decrease in DNA synthesis in vitro and in regenerating hearts in vivo. These data suggest that PDGF signaling is required for zebrafish heart regeneration and show that microarray analysis is a valuable approach to study the molecular mechanisms of this process. </p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Gene Expression Profiling of Zebrafish Heart Regeneration</title><p>To identify molecular signals that initiate regeneration, we focused our gene expression profile analysis on the early stages of zebrafish heart regeneration. Sham-operated hearts and regenerating hearts were collected at 3, 7, and 14 dpa. To enrich for transcripts that are involved in regeneration, we dissected one third of the ventricle containing the amputation plane. Ten to 12 heart regenerates were dissected and pooled for analysis.</p><p>We used Affymetrix zebrafish GeneChips to perform transcriptional profiling. This allowed simultaneous analysis of approximately 14,900 transcripts. According to the annotation of the transcripts at the time of manuscript preparation, these represent 10,318 genes, providing approximately 45&#x00025; coverage of the zebrafish genome. We identified 662 transcripts that are differentially expressed in at least one of the three time points tested during the regeneration process ( <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sd001">Dataset S1</xref>). Hierarchical clustering revealed groups of genes that were expressed at different time points during regeneration ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040260-g001">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg001">S1</xref>). Pairwise comparisons revealed that regenerating hearts at 3 dpa had the highest number of differentially expressed genes and that regenerating hearts at 3 dpa and 7 dpa shared a high percentage of genes with increased expression ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040260-g001">Figure 1</xref>). </p><p>Expression of 142 genes (21.4&#x00025;; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg001">Figure S1</xref>, cluster I) were generally decreased during the regeneration process; 53 (8.0&#x00025;) genes were specifically expressed at 3 dpa ( <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg001">Figure S1</xref>, cluster II); 232 genes (35.0&#x00025;) were preferentially expressed at 3 and 7 dpa ( <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg001">Figure S1</xref>, cluster III); 26 genes (3.9&#x00025;) were most highly expressed at 7 dpa ( <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg001">Figure S1</xref>, cluster IV); 180 genes (27.1&#x00025;) were expressed across the early regeneration process ( <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg001">Figure S1</xref>, cluster V); and 32 genes (4.8&#x00025;) were mainly expressed at 7 to 14 dpa ( <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg001">Figure S1</xref>, cluster VI).

Of 662 transcripts that are differentially expressed during heart regeneration, 132 genes were also differentially expressed during fin regeneration ( <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st001">Table S1</xref> and &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040260-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;). One hundred nineteen transcripts were upregulated and 13 transcripts were downregulated during both heart and fin regeneration. <italic>mps1</italic> was one of the commonly upregulated genes. This is consistent with our previous findings that <italic>ncp</italic> mutants are defective for both heart and fin regeneration &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040260-b008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040260-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;.

To determine the functions of the secreted factors identified by gene expression analysis at the cellular level, we turned to cultured cardiomyocytes. We modified a previously published protocol for primary culture of zebrafish adult cardiomyocytes &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040260-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d; to obtain a larger quantity of cells that can be cultured for 7 to 10 d. Cardiomyocytes in our primary culture were positively identified by staining with antibodies against the cardiomyocyte markers tropomyosin ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040260-g005">Figure 5</xref>A) and MEF2 (unpublished data). In culture, the cardiomyocytes gradually underwent dedifferentiation, characterized by disorganized cytoskeletal striation and loss of its rod-shaped morphology ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040260-g005">Figure 5</xref>A), similar to the previously reported phenomena for adult rat and newt cardiomyocytes in culture &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040260-b026">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040260-b027">27</xref>&#x0005d;. We tested the effects of apoE, Granulin, midkine, and PDGF-AA, -AB, and -BB homodimers and heterodimers in inducing DNA synthesis on zebrafish cardiomyocytes ( <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st002">Table S2</xref>). Among these factors, we observed that PDGF-BB increased BrdU incorporation (2.68 &#x000b1; 0.05 fold, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) compared to control after 7 d of treatment ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040260-g005">Figure 5</xref>B) while the other factors tested had little or no effects ( <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st002">Table S2</xref>). We did not detect mitosis in PDGF-BB treated cardiomyocytes by staining with anti-phosphorylated histone-3 antibody (unpublished data). To determine whether mammalian PDGF-BB and the zebrafish homolog have different effects, we produced recombinant zebrafish PDGF-BB protein (zPDGF-BB). zPDGF-BB induced similar levels of DNA synthesis as mammalian PDGF-BB in zebrafish cardiomyocytes but not mitosis (unpublished data). Both PDGF-BB and zPDGF-BB induced DNA synthesis in cardiomyocytes of a variety of different sizes and shapes, indicating that the proliferative capacity of cardiomyocytes is not limited to a specific subpopulation of cardiomyocytes ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040260-g005">Figure 5</xref>C). To demonstrate that PDGF treatment on zebrafish cardiomyocytes is specifically activating the PDGF signaling pathway, we utilized a selective PDGFR chemical inhibitor, AG1295 &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040260-b028">28</xref>&#x0005d;. AG1295 selectively inhibits PDGFR tyrosine kinase activity &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040260-b029">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040260-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d; and inhibits PDGF signaling required for morphogenic movement during zebrafish gastrulation &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040260-b031">31</xref>&#x0005d;. In cultured adult zebrafish cardiomyocytes, AG1295 inhibited the DNA synthesis induced by PDGF-BB ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040260-g005">Figure 5</xref>B). We conclude that PDGF signaling induces DNA synthesis in zebrafish cardiomyocytes in vitro. </p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>PDGF Signaling Is Required for Cardiomyocyte Proliferation during Zebrafish Heart Regeneration</title><p>To address the role of PDGF signaling in zebrafish heart regeneration in vivo, we tested the effect of AG1295 on DNA synthesis in cardiomyocytes. After heart surgery, the fish were allowed to recover for 1 d and were treated with AG1295 or DMSO as a negative control from 2 dpa to 14 dpa. To rule out potential nonspecific effects caused by treatment with chemical inhibitors, we used another chemical inhibitor as a specificity control. From our microarray analysis, we found that the genes coding for the metalloproteinases MMP2 and MMP14 were upregulated at 7 to 14 dpa. We tested whether the MMP inhibitor GM6001 &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040260-b032">32</xref>&#x0005d; would inhibit DNA synthesis of cardiomyocytes. At 14 dpa, fish treated with DMSO and inhibitors were sacrificed to assess DNA synthesis in cardiomyocytes. While cardiomyocytes of zebrafish treated with DMSO ( <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 10), GM6001 ( <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 8), and AG1295 ( <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 10) still underwent DNA synthesis ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040260-g006">Figure 6</xref>A), cardiomyocytes from AG1295-treated fish had 16&#x00025; fewer BrdU-positive cells relative to the DMSO-treated control fish, as determined by BrdU and MEF2 double staining ( <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). By contrast, cardiomyocytes from GM6001-treated fish did not have a significantly reduced level of DNA synthesis compared to DMSO-treated control fish ( <italic>p</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05). Importantly, heart regeneration was inhibited in GM6001-treated fish when assessed at 30 dpa (unpublished data), indicating that GM6001 was efficacious under our assay conditions. These results suggest that PDGF signaling is specifically required for proliferation of a portion of cardiomyocytes in vivo during heart regeneration. </p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we have systematically examined gene expression involved in zebrafish heart regeneration using DNA microarray analysis. Transcriptional profiling of regenerating zebrafish hearts revealed genes that are differentially expressed at 3, 7, and 14 dpa during regeneration. The stage-specific regulation suggests that the regeneration process begins with wound healing, followed by increased expression of several genes encoding secreted molecules and then followed by tissue remodeling. Several of these genes were specifically upregulated around the wound site in regenerating hearts and encode secreted molecules that might function as initiation signals for regeneration. Among these was <italic>pdgf-b,</italic> a previously unidentified zebrafish gene. We further showed that PDGF-B signaling contributes to heart regeneration by inducing DNA synthesis of zebrafish cardiomyocytes. Our results demonstrate that microarray analysis is a powerful approach to study heart regeneration, a phenomenon for which forward genetic approaches may not be practical. With a set of candidate genes identified from our microarray analysis, we now can use reverse genetic and pharmacological approaches to study the functions of these genes. </p><p>Zebrafish hearts regenerate by cardiomyocyte proliferation around the wound. The signals that trigger regeneration are presumably secreted molecules originating from the wound. Among the genes we identified encoding secreted molecules, several may serve as potential factors that trigger regeneration. For example, the mouse homolog of <italic>thymosin</italic> &#x003b2; <italic>4</italic> has been shown to be protective to the heart after infarction by activating integrin-linked kinase and AKT signaling to promote cardiac cell migration and survival &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040260-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d;. In this study we showed that PDGF-BB homodimers increased DNA synthesis in adult zebrafish cardiomyocytes and that PDGF signaling is required for proliferation of cardiomyocytes during zebrafish heart regeneration. Consistent with our findings, PDGF-BB induces DNA synthesis in adult newt cardiomyocytes &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040260-b033">33</xref>&#x0005d;. We also observed that PDGF-BB induces DNA synthesis in rat neonatal cardiomyocytes (unpublished data), suggesting an evolutionarily conserved mechanism for PDGF signaling in the heart. Hsieh et al. &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040260-b034">34</xref>&#x0005d; recently showed that PDGF-BB delivered into the heart by peptide nanofibers protects against cardiac infarction in rats. The identification of <italic>pdgf-b</italic> and <italic>thymosin</italic> &#x003b2; <italic>4</italic> in our study validates our microarray approach as a strategy for the discovery of genes that may be therapeutic targets for regenerative medicine. The in vivo mechanisms of the PDGF pathway and other factors identified from our microarray analysis in zebrafish heart regeneration remain to be elucidated. Inducible transgenic zebrafish expressing dominant-negative forms of these factors can be used to address these questions via a loss-of-function genetic approach, but this is beyond the scope of this study. </p><p>Using a selective inhibitor of PDGF receptor kinase activity, we showed that blocking PDGF signaling results in a decrease of DNA synthesis of cardiomyocytes during heart regeneration. However, DNA synthesis in cardiomyocytes is not completely blocked by inhibition of PDGF signaling. This suggests that the PDGF pathway, although sufficient to induce DNA synthesis in cardiomyocytes, might act in parallel with other signaling pathways to induce cardiomyocyte proliferation and myocardial regeneration. This is supported by our finding that multiple growth factors are upregulated during heart regeneration. For instance, <italic>igf-2</italic> was upregulated during zebrafish heart regeneration. <italic>igf-2</italic> was previously shown to induce DNA synthesis in fetal rat cardiomyocytes &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040260-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;. In addition, we previously showed that FGF1 induces high level of DNA synthesis in rat cardiomyocytes &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040260-b035">35</xref>&#x0005d;. It is likely that FGF signaling also plays important roles in regulating cardiomyocyte proliferation during heart regeneration. Raya et al. &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040260-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d; reported that <italic>notch1b</italic> and <italic>deltaC</italic> are upregulated during zebrafish heart regeneration, suggesting that the Delta-Notch signaling pathway might be also involved in the control of cardiomyocyte proliferation. Interestingly, <italic>notch1b</italic> and <italic>deltaC</italic> are expressed throughout the ventricle but are excluded from the wound site &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040260-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;. Thus, we did not detect <italic>notch1b</italic> and <italic>deltaC</italic> upregulation in our microarray analysis. </p><p>Comparison of gene expression profiles between fin and heart regeneration revealed a set of common factors as well as tissue-specific factors. Only 20&#x00025; of genes that were differentially expressed during heart regeneration were also differentially expressed in regenerating fins. This is not surprising, considering that zebrafish hearts regenerate by cardiomyocyte proliferation &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040260-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;, whereas fin regeneration involves the formation of a blastema, a mass of proliferative, pluripotent progenitor cells &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040260-b036">36</xref>&#x0005d;. Furthermore, heart and fin are composed of very different cell types. Thus, many factors involved in the regeneration of these organs must be tissue specific. However, besides the differentially expressed genes in heart and fin regeneration identified by microarray analysis, other genes could be involved in both processes but not regulated at the RNA level. For instance, we previously showed that <italic>hsp60</italic> is required for both fin and heart regeneration &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040260-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;. <italic>hsp60</italic> is differentially expressed during fin regeneration &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040260-b012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040260-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;, but not during heart regeneration, suggesting that <italic>hsp60</italic> is regulated posttranscriptionally in the heart. Transcripts differentially expressed during both heart and fin regeneration could be involved in other regeneration processes. For instance, <italic>midkine</italic> was previously shown to be important for liver regeneration &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040260-b037">37</xref>&#x0005d;. We found that many common factors are involved in regulation of inflammation, cell adhesion, and the extracellular matrix ( <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st001">Table S1</xref>). For example, MMPs have been shown to be involved in fin regeneration &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040260-b038">38</xref>&#x0005d;. Interestingly, they are also required for newt limb regeneration &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040260-b039">39</xref>&#x0005d;. Extracellular matrix proteins such as fibronectin are upregulated in both heart and fin regeneration ( <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st001">Table S1</xref>). Interestingly, fibronectin is also important for liver regeneration &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040260-b040">40</xref>&#x0005d;. </p><p>Using the genetically tractable zebrafish as a model organism combined with cDNA microarray technology, we hope to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying heart regeneration in lower vertebrates. We have identified genes that serve as regulators during heart regeneration. Together with evolutionarily conserved genetic program among vertebrates, these genes represent promising candidates for future therapeutic approaches in regenerative medicine.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Zebrafish husbandry, heart amputation, and inhibitors' treatment.</title><p>Zebrafish were raised and maintained as described &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040260-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;.
