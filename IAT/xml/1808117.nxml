Little is known about the role of intracellular regulation of the TGF-&#x003b2; pathway in development. E3 ubiquitin ligases target specific protein substrates for proteasome-mediated degradation, and several are implicated in signaling. We have shown that Arkadia, a nuclear RING-domain E3 ubiquitin ligase, is essential for a subset of Nodal functions in the embryo, but the molecular mechanism of its action in embryonic cells had not been addressed. Here, we find that Arkadia facilitates Nodal signaling broadly in the embryo, and that it is indispensable for cell fates that depend on maximum signaling. Loss of Arkadia in embryonic cells causes nuclear accumulation of phospho-Smad2/3 (P-Smad2/3), the effectors of Nodal signaling; however, these must be repressed or hypoactive as the expression of their direct target genes is reduced or lost. Molecular and functional analysis shows that Arkadia interacts with and ubiquitinates P-Smad2/3 causing their degradation, and that this is via the same domains required for enhancing their activity. Consistent with this dual function, introduction of Arkadia in homozygous null (&#x02212;/&#x02212;) embryonic stem cells activates the accumulated and hypoactive P-Smad2/3 at the expense of their abundance. <italic>Arkadia</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212; cells, like <italic>Smad2&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic> cells, cannot form foregut and prechordal plate in chimeras, confirming this functional interaction in vivo. As Arkadia overexpression never represses, and in some cells enhances signaling, the degradation of P-Smad2/3 by Arkadia cannot occur prior to their activation in the nucleus. Therefore, Arkadia provides a mechanism for signaling termination at the end of the cascade by coupling degradation of P-Smad2/3 with the activation of target gene transcription. This mechanism can account for achieving efficient and maximum Nodal signaling during embryogenesis and for rapid resetting of target gene promoters allowing cells to respond to dynamic changes in extracellular signals.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>In development, cells respond to secreted signals (called morphogens) by turning on or off sets of target genes. How does gene activity adjust quickly in response to rapidly changing extracellular signals? This should require efficient removal of old/used signaling effectors (signal-activated transcription factors) from the promoters of target genes to allow new ones to assume control. We previously discovered Arkadia, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, and showed that it is an essential factor for normal development. (Ubiquitin ligases trigger the addition of ubiquitin residues to proteins, typically marking them for degradation.) Here, we show that Arkadia is required for high activity of the major signaling pathway, TGF-&#x003b2;/Nodal. Arkadia has a dual role to degrade Smads, the TGF-&#x003b2; signaling effectors, and enhance their transcriptional activity. This coupling of degradation with activation provides a mechanism to ensure that only effectors &#x0201c;in use&#x0201d; are degraded, allowing the new ones to proceed. It is possible that very similar mechanisms operate in other pathways to establish dynamic regulation and efficient signaling, while their failure may be associated with developmental abnormalities and disease, including cancer.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>Arkadia enhances TGF-&#x003b2; family activity by degrading its inhibitory Smads but also stimulating transcription of phospho-Smads.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="18"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Mavrakis KJ, Andrew RL, Lee KL, Petropoulou C, Dixon JE, et al.

Two different Smad signaling branches have been described.

Furthermore, proteasome-mediated degradation of ubiquitin-modified core components of the TGF-&#x003b2; signaling cascade has been shown to play a major role in controlling signaling output &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050067-b032">32</xref>&#x0005d;. Poly-ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation of proteins is one of the most prominent turnover mechanisms in the cell. Ubiquitination of protein substrates involves a cascade of enzymatic reactions. E3 ubiquitin ligases are the critical components responsible for the recognition of specific substrates for ubiquitination &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050067-b033">33</xref>&#x0005d;.

However, ligases that terminate signaling by degrading activated Smads (P-Smads) have not been identified.</p><p>One of the important unanswered questions is how long the activated Smads transcribe target genes and how the promoters are refreshed to allow rapid intracellular responses to dynamic changes in concentration of ligands. Both de-phosphorylation of P-Smads followed by cytoplasmic recycling &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050067-b037">37</xref>&#x0005d; and proteasome-mediated degradation of P-Smads have been proposed to terminate signaling in the nucleus &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050067-b038">38</xref>&#x0005d;. However, there was no explanation for how &#x0201c;used&#x0201d; versus &#x0201c;unused&#x0201d; activated effectors could be distinguished by these mechanisms. An obvious mechanism to limit the time that an effector works is to link its turnover with its ability to drive transcription.</p><p>We have shown previously that Arkadia, a nuclear RING-domain ubiquitin ligase, enhances Nodal signaling and is essential for the induction of the organizer/node &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050067-b039">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050067-b040">40</xref>&#x0005d;. In somatic tumor cell lines, Arkadia has been shown to enhance TGF-&#x003b2; signaling by ubiquitin-mediated degradation of Smad6/7 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050067-b041">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050067-b042">42</xref>&#x0005d;. However, we show here that Arkadia functions by a different mechanism in embryonic cells. Specifically, we find that Arkadia directly ubiquitinates and degrades P-Smad2/3 and that this is coupled with their high activity. The link between activity and degradation provides a mechanism to ensure that only &#x0201c;used&#x0201d; P-Smad2/3 effectors are degraded and that signaling is terminated at the end of the cascade and not before. Therefore, Arkadia can account for rapid resetting of actively transcribed promoters, forcing transcription to rely only on fresh P-Smads and allowing cells to respond to dynamic changes in signaling. Similar mechanisms may operate in other signaling pathways in development to achieve peak efficiency and dynamic responses of cells during development.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Arkadia Enhances Signaling in All Major Nodal-Dependent Developmental Events</title><p>The phenotype of <italic>Arkadia&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic> embryos consists of loss of anterior primitive streak derivatives (node, notochord, prechordal plate, and anterior definitive endoderm &#x0005b;ADE&#x0005d;/foregut) leading to anterior patterning defects including head truncations &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050067-b039">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050067-b040">40</xref>&#x0005d;.

We used HEK293T (293T) cells stably expressing moderate levels of full-length Arkadia, tagged either with Flag on the N-terminus and Myc on the C-terminus, or with green fluorescent protein (GFP) fused to the N-terminus (GAkd).

Furthermore, we examined the interaction of Arkadia with other phosphorylated Smads (Smad1/5/8; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050067-sg003">Figure S3</xref>A) or with Smad4 (unpublished data) and found no evidence of interaction.

To understand the interaction of Arkadia with P-Smad2/3, we mapped further the responsible domain. We used transient transfections of 293T cells to test the ability of various deletions of Arkadia (all GFP-tagged; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g003">Figure 3</xref>D) to IP P-Smad2/3.

Deletion of the C-terminal end of Arkadia (GAkdR&#x0002a;) that eliminates one of the Zinc-binding fingers of the RING domain (965&#x02013;989 aa) does not affect the interaction with P-Smad2/3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g003">Figure 3</xref>F). However, deletion of the NRG completely abrogates the interaction with P-Smad2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g003">Figure 3</xref>E). To confirm that the NRG domain is necessary for the interaction with P-Smad2/3 within the context of the full-length Arkadia protein, we generated an internal partial deletion of only the first eight residues of the NRG (GAkdNRG&#x0002a;) and showed that it diminishes the interaction with P-Smad2/3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g003">Figure 3</xref>F). As judged by fluorescence from the GFP tag, all of the above mutant Arkadia proteins are localized in the nucleus and are expressed at comparable levels to full-length Arkadia (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050067-sg004">Figure S4</xref>), indicating that loss of the interaction of the various Arkadia deletion constructs is not due to instability or differential localization. Collectively, the above data indicate that Arkadia interacts directly with P-Smad2/3 via its 100-aa C-terminal portion and that within this domain, a 14-aa NRG motif is essential for this interaction. As the 293T cells that we used for the IPs do not express <italic>FoxH1</italic> (unpublished data), one of the major P-Smad2/3 transcription partners in early embryogenesis, we conclude that the interaction of Arkadia with P-Smad2/3 may not depend on a particular partner.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>P-Smad2/3 Are Substrates of Arkadia Ubiquitination</title><p>As P-Smad2/3 interact with Arkadia, it is possible that they are substrates of Arkadia ubiquitination.

As it is possible that different domains mediate the two opposing functions, we used the &#x02212;/&#x02212; ES cell functional assay to identify domains that are essential for Arkadia to enhance reporter activity. We found that Arkadia constructs with ubiquitin ligase domain mutations (GAkdR&#x0002a; and GAkdR2&#x0002a;) or Arkadia without the P-Smad2/3 interaction domain (NRG deletion, GAkdNRG) fail to enhance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g005">Figure 5</xref>E); suggesting that like the degradation of P-Smad2/3, activation also requires a direct interaction with Arkadia and its ubiquitin ligase activity. Examination of several N-terminal deletions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g003">Figure 3</xref>D) showed that the C-terminal half (516&#x02013;989 aa) of Arkadia is the minimum region sufficient to enhance the reporter efficiently (unpublished data). Furthermore, loss of the P-Smad2/3 activation, but not the degradation properties of Arkadia, is expected to convert it to a repressor of signaling. However, none of the deletions and mutations of Arkadia separated the two functions. Together, the above data suggest that Arkadia activates and degrades P-Smad2/3 via the same domains and that the two functions are most likely coupled.</p></sec><sec id="s2i"><title>Enhancement of P-Smad2/3 by Arkadia Occurs at the Expense of Their Abundance</title><p>To test whether the activation of the hypoactive P-Smad2/3 by Arkadia occurs at the expense of their levels, we examined the relationship between levels of endogenous P-Smad2 and the degree of enhancement after expression of Arkadia in &#x02212;/&#x02212; ES cells. To visualize levels of endogenous P-Smad2, we isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) pure populations of cells transfected with GAkd or enzymatically (ubiquitin ligase) inactive Arkadia (GAkdR&#x0002a;) or control GFP constructs. A portion of the cells was used for luciferase assays and the rest was used to examine endogenous P-Smad2 and total Smad2 levels in Western blots. As before, Arkadia enhances signaling only in &#x02212;/&#x02212; ES cells in a ubiquitin-ligase-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g006">Figure 6</xref>A); and this phenomenon was accompanied by an 80&#x00025; reduction in the level of P-Smad2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g006">Figure 6</xref>B), confirming that activation of the hypoactive P-Smad2 is followed by its degradation.</p><p>We performed the same experiment in wild-type ES cells and found that overexpression of Arkadia does not change the levels of endogenous P-Smad2 or the reporter activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g006">Figure 6</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g006">6</xref>B). We conclude that in wild-type cells endogenous Arkadia must be in excess and sufficient to activate all available P-Smad2/3 in the nucleus. The fact that P-Smad2 is not eliminated and signaling is never repressed by the overexpression of Arkadia suggests that only a fraction of P-Smad2 interacts with and gets degraded by Arkadia, i.e., nuclear P-Smads and perhaps those engaged in transcription. The above data confirm the dual role and coexisting functions of Arkadia, suggesting that Arkadia enhances P-Smad2/3 activity at the expense of their levels.</p></sec><sec id="s2j"><title>Super-Activation by Arkadia in &#x02212;/&#x02212; ES Cells Is a Transient Phenomenon</title><p>An interesting observation is that in &#x02212;/&#x02212; ES cells, Arkadia expression not only restores the transcriptional deficit but it enhances reporter activity on average 50&#x00025; (line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g005">Figure 5</xref>C) or 100&#x00025; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g005">Figure 5</xref>D) above the maximum level that can be achieved in wild-type ES cells. The simplest explanation for this phenomenon is that the extra activity most likely reflects the accumulated levels of the hypoactive P-Smad2/3 that is being simultaneously activated by the expression of Arkadia. As this enhancement exceeds the maximum that can be achieved in wild-type ES cells even under ligand stimulation conditions, we termed it super-activation. According to this hypothesis, Arkadia expression in &#x02212;/&#x02212; ES cells will eventually &#x0201c;consume&#x0201d; (activate and degrade) the accumulated P-Smad2/3, releasing their activity to produce a transient super-activation of target genes. Subsequently, target gene transcription will be reduced to basal levels similar to that of wild-type cells.</p><p>We tested this prediction by comparing the percentage of enhancement by GAkd over that of the GFP control at different time points after transfection in <italic>Arkadia&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic> ES cells.

GFP fluorescence remained high throughout the experiment and past 48 h (unpublished data) and does not account for the loss of super-activation at 30 h. The above data suggest that in &#x02212;/&#x02212; ES cells Arkadia releases the activity of the hypoactive and stable P-Smad2/3 pool causing target gene transcription above wild-type levels (super-activation), and as this is a transient phenomenon, it occurs at the expense of P-Smad2/3 abundance. Therefore, Arkadia functions by a mechanism that consumes P-Smad2/3 as it activates them.</p></sec><sec id="s2k"><title>Arkadia Is Required for Nodal Target Gene Expression in the Embryo</title><p>All the above analysis shows that in ES cells Arkadia functions as a coactivator of P-Smad2/3 transcription.

We show here that Arkadia terminates signaling at the level of transcription, by linking the ubiquitination/degradation of P-Smad2/3 to their transcriptional activity. Therefore, this mechanism enhances transcription but limits the time that the effector works by inducing its turnover. This represents the first example of coupled activation and degradation of signaling effectors, as well as a critical role for this mechanism in development. It is possible that very similar mechanisms operate in other pathways to establish dynamic regulation and efficient signaling, while their failure may be associated with disease.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>P-Smad2/3 Turnover</title><p>Experiments using somatic tissue culture cell lines showed that Arkadia might enhance TGF-&#x003b2; signaling by degrading the Smad6/7, which are known to inhibit Smad2/3 phosphorylation mainly by mediating the degradation of the receptors &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050067-b041">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050067-b042">42</xref>&#x0005d;.

Contrary to this prediction, all <italic>Arkadia&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic> embryos and ES cells have at least 2-fold higher P-Smad2/3 levels compared to wild-type. Therefore, Arkadia must enhance signaling via a different mechanism during early development.</p><p>In vivo, in ES cells, MEFs, and embryos, loss of Arkadia causes P-Smad2/3 stabilization and accumulation in the nucleus and makes them resistant to proteasome degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g004">Figure 4</xref>), suggesting that Arkadia directly or indirectly is associated with their stability and degradation. Destruction of P-Smad2 had been shown previously to occur in the nucleus &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050067-b038">38</xref>&#x0005d;, but a nuclear ubiquitin ligase that interacts specifically with the phosphorylated form of Smad2/3, as well as the role of proteasome-mediated turnover of P-Smads during development, remained unknown. We present here a number of experiments indicating that Arkadia, a nuclear E3 ubiquitin ligase, interacts with P-Smad2/3 and directly ubiquitinates them leading to their degradation by the proteasome. These include IP experiments showing that Arkadia interacts specifically with the phosphorylated forms of Smad2/3 via the conserved NRG domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g003">Figure 3</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g003">3</xref>B), and in vitro ubiquitination assays showing that Arkadia directly poly-ubiquitinates P-Smad2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g004">Figures 4</xref>A&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g004">4</xref>C and S5). Furthermore, introduction of Arkadia in &#x02212;/&#x02212; cells causes P-Smad2 poly-ubiquitination and decreases its abundance in a proteasome-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g004">Figure 4</xref>D&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g004">4</xref>E). However, as Arkadia is nuclear, it most likely degrades nuclear P-Smads.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Signaling Termination at the End of the Cascade</title><p>One of the major questions is how effector activity is terminated after target genes have been activated and not before. This should involve a mechanism to distinguish between effectors actively engaged in transcription and those that are fresh and unused. A modification or a change of conformation of the effectors when they interact with the target-gene promoter complex may allow recognition by a critical component of the termination mechanism (referred to subsequently as the terminator). In this case, absence of the terminator should lead to a prolonged, persistent response to signaling, as the unhindered effectors will continue to transcribe. On the other hand, excess terminator could cause repression of signaling if it degrades and deactivates the effectors prematurely, i.e., as soon as they bind to the promoter. A more precise and efficient mechanism would involve degradation of the effectors after they activate at least one round of transcription. This requires a terminator directly involved in transcription by the effectors or an even more stringent mechanism, where initiation of transcription is linked with the destruction of the transcription factor: a &#x0201c;suicide&#x0201d; model. In this case, absence of the terminator will pause transcription, while its overexpression will not degrade/deactivate the effectors prematurely to repress target gene transcription. We show here that Arkadia fulfils the criteria of such a termination mechanism as it degrades P-Smad2/3 and enhances their target gene transcription via the same domains.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>P-Smad2/3 Activation</title><p>Does Arkadia directly activate P-Smad2/3? In the absence of Arkadia, P-Smad2/3 are stable and accumulate in the nucleus, but they are repressed or hypoactive as target gene transcription is reduced and in some cases lost (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g007">Figure 7</xref>). Introduction of Arkadia in &#x02212;/&#x02212; ES cells not only restores signaling but super-activates P-Smads, meaning that the expression of the reporter reaches levels higher than those that can be achieved in wild-type ES cells under maximum ligand stimulation conditions. The above findings suggest that the extra activity is not generated by receptors or ligands, but by the release of activity from the pools of the accumulated hypoactive P-Smad2/3. Consistent with this hypothesis, super-activation by Arkadia in &#x02212;/&#x02212; ES cells is a transient phenomenon, as it depends on the excess P-Smad2 that is used up. Therefore, Arkadia degrades and spends P-Smad2/3 to activate their transcriptional activity. These observations suggest that P-Smad2/3 is reminiscent of fuel, which in the absence of Arkadia is stable and can be stored, while in its presence it is &#x0201c;ignited&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;burns,&#x0201d; releasing activity. These observations suggest that phosphorylation of Smad2/3 by the receptors is not sufficient for their transcriptional activity and that they require an additional step mediated by the function of Arkadia as a coactivator in the nucleus.</p><p>We have shown previously that in <italic>Xenopus</italic> animal cap assay, injection of Arkadia RNA enhances the ability of Nodal but not that of Smad2 RNA to induce mesendoderm &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050067-b040">40</xref>&#x0005d;. This appears inconsistent with our current data, however; as in the animal cap there is no ligand to phosphorylate Smad2, it remains a mystery how Smad2 RNA injection alone induces mesoderm and mesendoderm. Furthermore, the amount of Smad2 RNA required for this is very high and most likely does not represent physiological signaling conditions. More importantly, we show here that Arkadia recognizes P-Smad2 and not Smad2, and therefore it is not surprising that in the Smad2-injected animal caps Arkadia does not induce mesendoderm.</p><p>While the exact mechanism of how P-Smad2/3 are activated by Arkadia remains unknown, it is important to point out that Arkadia does not degrade P-Smads directly, it only modifies them by ubiquitination and is the proteasome that degrades them. Although the role of ubiquitin modification in mediating proteasome degradation is well established, it has become apparent that addition of ubiquitin onto proteins may also affect their properties. Recent studies have suggested a direct role of ubiquitin modifications and of the proteasome in transcriptional activation (reviewed in &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050067-b060">60</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050067-b063">63</xref>&#x0005d;). It is possible, however, that Arkadia interacts with, and degrades simultaneously, P-Smads and a closely linked repressor. Future studies will determine the mechanism of P-Smad2/3 activation and how this is coupled with immediate degradation. In conclusion, by linking P-Smad2/3 activation with degradation, Arkadia provides a way to achieve rapid resetting of P-Smad2/3 target gene transcription in development and allows efficient and dynamic responses to Nodal/TGF-&#x003b2; signaling events.</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>Nodal Expression and the Induction of the Node/Organizer</title><p>We had shown previously that <italic>Arkadia&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic> embryos do not develop anterior primitive streak and its derivative tissues: ADE/future foregut, mesendoderm (prechordal plate and notochord), and node &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050067-b039">39</xref>&#x0005d;.

This indicates that the development of the node in the embryonic lineages requires Arkadia expression and function within a different lineage (extraembryonic). As Arkadia is nuclear and unlikely to be secreted, this effect was presumed to be mediated by a downstream-secreted factor. Here we show that Arkadia increases directly the transcription of P-Smad2 target genes, which include the <italic>Nodal</italic> gene itself, particularly in the VE and early epiblast when node precursors are induced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g007">Figure 7</xref>).

The Nodal target genes that are responsible for foregut and prechordal plate development remain unknown. However, the development of these tissues must depend on the expression of Arkadia within these cells or their precursors. This was shown by the analysis of chimeric embryos consisting of a mixture of wild-type and <italic>Arkadia&#x02212;/&#x02212;</italic> cells, which revealed that the &#x02212;/&#x02212; cells could not contribute to these tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g007">Figure 7</xref>O and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050067-g007">7</xref>P).

It is possible that such a mechanism may be responsible for maximizing Nodal signaling in the embryo. However, it would require the transient absence of Arkadia in the precursors of the ADE/foregut. Although Arkadia RNA is present broadly in the embryo, protein analysis is needed to reveal whether super-activation occurs in the embryo.</p><p>In conclusion, we reveal a novel ubiquitin-mediated mechanism of TGF-&#x003b2; signaling regulation that depends on Arkadia, involves the activation of P-Smad2/3 signaling effectors downstream of receptor-phosphorylation, and couples their high activity with turnover and signaling termination. As the TGF-&#x003b2;/Nodal signaling pathway has been linked to cancers and genetic diseases, the identification of key molecular players such as Arkadia would be useful for the development of new drug targets and therapeutic intervention.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Expression analysis.</title><p>Chimeras were generated as described before &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050067-b039">39</xref>&#x0005d;.

Western blotting of IPs with anti-Smad2 antibody reveals this interaction to be specific to the phosphorylated form of Smad2 (A). The band in the total tissue cell lysates (TCL) and supernatants (SN) in SB-treated samples may correspond to P-Smad1 that does not coIP with Flag-Arkadia (B). Compare the intensity of the band in the TCL and SN to see the depletion of P-Smad3 after IP.</p><p>(C) Autoradiograph showing in vitro transcribed/translated <sup>35</sup>S-labeled full-length Arkadia (Akd), N-terminal portion (N-Akd), and luciferase (Luc) protein input.

P-Smad2 protein is shown to coIP with the G-NRG-RING and not with other shorter forms missing the NRG domain. P-Smad3 protein is shown to coIP with full-length Arkadia (GAkd) and a RING domain deletion (GAkdR&#x0002a;). Note the presence of ladder and smear in GFP-tagged Arkadias including the G-NRG-RING, indicating that these proteins are unstable and heavily modified (including poly-ubiquitin chains; unpublished data).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pbio.0050067.g003"/></fig><fig id="pbio-0050067-g004" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Arkadia Ubiquitinates P-Smad2 and Mediates Its Degradation via the Proteasome</title><p>(A and B) IP with anti-Flag antibody from <italic>Akd</italic>&#x02212;/&#x02212; MEFs transiently transfected with various plasmids as indicated, and Western blotted (WB) with anti-P-Smad2, anti-HA, or anti-ubiquitin antibodies.

P-Smad2 protein levels decrease specifically in cells expressing Arkadia, and this does not occur when the proteasome is inhibited or when the RING domain is mutated (GAkdR&#x0002a;), indicating that the degradation is mediated via the proteasome and the ubiquitin ligase activity of Arkadia.
