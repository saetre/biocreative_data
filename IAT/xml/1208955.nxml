SP-A has a potent immunomodulatory function with the N-terminal and C-terminal portions of the molecule capable of either activating or suppressing functions of cells of the immune system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>Allergen-induced asthma is characterized by the activation and steering of T-cells to a "helper" (Th) 2-type inflammation with eosinophilia, high serum immunoglobulin (Ig) E levels, reversible airway obstruction and hyper responsiveness (AHR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. We have previously shown that allergic AHR is associated with disruption of surfactant biophysics, changes in the hydrophobic surfactant protein B and C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] and upregulation of the lung collectin SP-D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>While SP-A is the most abundant and most extensively studied surfactant protein in the lung immune homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], it is unclear how this molecule is regulated or functions during allergic inflammation. Published studies have shown that SP-A can inhibit lymphocyte function <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and that administration of this protein in murine models ameliorated allergic changes in the lung [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], indicating a potential protective role. However, its direct regulatory action has not been detailed. The results of this study indicate specific changes in SP-A expression during development of an allergen induced immune response and show that SP-A can directly modulate the function of Th lymphocytes suggesting a regulatory link between innate and adaptive immunity in allergic airway inflammation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Murine model of <italic>Af </italic>sensitization</title><p>Sensitized mice were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 20 &#x003bc;g of <italic>Af </italic>(Hollister Stier, Elkhart, IN) and 20 mg Al(OH)<sub>3 </sub>(Imject Alum; Pierce, Rockford, IL) in PBS (100 &#x003bc;l) on days 1 and 14, followed by intranasal (i.n.) challenge on day 27 with 25 &#x003bc;l of allergen extract: (12.5 &#x003bc;g <italic>Af </italic>in 21% glycerol/ PBS).

Baseline proliferation of na&#x000ef;ve lymphocytes was not affected by SP-A (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>).

The relationship of SP-A production to inflammatory changes in the lung however is poorly defined. This study reports that a transient decrease in airway SP-A levels is associated with mRNA transcription and release of Th2-type cytokines following allergen provocation. The results also demonstrate that this lung collectin has a direct negative regulatory effect on allergen-induced lymphocyte activation <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p><p>Studies investigating allergen-induced airway inflammation previously described either significant increases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] or decreases of this surfactant protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. One reason for the conflicting data may be that levels of SP-A undergo transitional changes during development of allergic inflammation. Our time course study confirmed that levels of SP-A in the BAL dramatically decreased to 25% of the original 12 h after <italic>Af </italic>challenge but completely recovered 72 h later. The exact mechanisms that regulate the changes of SP-A concentrations in the airways are uncertain. Since reduction in the absolute amounts of SP-A was only 42%, the effect of dilution by the extravasated plasma proteins 12 h after allergen challenge could have significantly added to the fall in the fractional SP-A concentrations. Nevertheless, while further studies are needed to unravel its intricate regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], it appears that an early decrease in the airway SP-A protein levels is not compensated immediately by enhanced synthesis or release, creating a relative, transient deficiency in this protein.</p><p>SP-A changes were comparable to that of SP-B and SP-C, described previously in a similar model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Interestingly, while SP-B and SP-C protein levels in the BAL closely matched their respective mRNA recovered from the lung tissue, the fall SP-A protein was not paralleled by mRNA decreases. Thus (unlike in SP-B and SP-C), there is a dissociation between SP-A mRNA and protein regulation during the acute phase of an inflammatory response in the lung. Such discrepancy was also observed in a study looking at the effects of secretagogue-induced stimulation of SP-A synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] and in an <italic>in vitro </italic>model where SP-A mRNA but not protein expression was induced by dexamethasone, cyclic AMP and IL-4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. In addition to not promptly following changes in mRNA production, SP-A did not require constitutive protein synthesis indicating a long intracellular half life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Taken together, our previous and current work suggests that there is a significant lag between transcriptional, translational and/or secretory processes in SP-A regulation. Although the implications of such SP-A deficiency are unclear, the regulatory effects on the adaptive immune function during development of an inflammatory response could be significant.</p><p>The inverse association we observed between levels of SP-A and the inflammatory changes 12 h after allergen provocation was used to generate our hypothesis that SP-A negatively regulates Th2 cytokine production. This hypothesis was then tested by directly adding SP-A to allergen-stimulated T cells. These results are in support of previous reports showing that administration of SP-A alleviated allergic inflammatory changes in mice (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]), however the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Binding of inhaled allergens such as particles of <italic>Af </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] and house-dust mite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] may be one way to interfere with the allergic response. A second mechanism could be an interference with the function of inflammatory effector cells as indicated by inhibitory effects of SP-A on chemokine release by activated eosinophils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Further, recent research has highlighted the role of SP-A on adaptive immune functions such as antigen presentation by dendritic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] and T cell activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. SP-A inhibited T-cell proliferation induced by various non-specific stimulators through both an IL-2 independent and an IL-2 and T cell receptor dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>The mechanism of T cell susceptibility to inhibition by SP-A needs further clarifications. While the inhibitory effects of SP-A have been demonstrated in antigen-stimulated human PBMC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] and more recently, in a murine system of splenocytes co-cultured with ovalbumin-specific T cell hybridomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], no study has examined the effect of SP-A on T cell proliferation in a mouse model of allergen-induced asthma <italic>in vitro</italic>. Here we present for the first time the inhibitory effects of SP-A on generational progression of sensitized lymphocytes to <italic>Af </italic>re-challenge <italic>in vitro</italic>. We show that this inhibition was dose-dependent. Further, inhibition of lymphocyte activation by SP-A was not due to toxic effects since baseline proliferation of the lymphocytes was not affected. In addition, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A</xref> demonstrates that CD3+/CD4+ lymphocytes had significantly inhibited proliferative ability (as measured by the CFSE content of the cells) in the presence of SP-A. In this FACS analysis study the dead cells were excluded and only the live cells were analyzed (an equal number of 10,000 events collected in every sample). These results suggest that SP-A has a direct effect in suppressing proliferation of cells. Previous studies similarly showed that neither SP-A nor SP-D affects cell viability or apoptosis in PMA and ionomycin-stimulated cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Similarly to a study using cells from human asthmatics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], we also showed that the inhibitory effect of SP-A did not depend on interference with the antigen-T cell receptor interaction since it suppressed both antigen- and mitogen-stimulated models of proliferation. Our studies however further indicated that in antigen-stimulated cultures sensitized cells exposed to greater antigen concentration and thus induced to proliferate more vigorously, were more susceptible to inhibition by SP-A. In addition, in the presence of SP-A there were significantly more sensitized CD4+ (not CD8+) lymphocytes in the parental (G1) population at higher <italic>Af </italic>concentrations, confirming that the antigen-responsive, stimulated T helper cell population is the target of SP-A.</p><p>The effects of SP-A treatment on inhibiting Th2 cytokines were previously studied <italic>ex vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Here we show that greater amount of airway SP-A was associated with a lesser extent of Th2 cytokine release <italic>in vivo </italic>and that there was a significant, negative correlation between SP-A and the amount of IL-4, IL-5 and eotaxin supporting the hypothesis that this collectin exerts an inhibitory effect on Th2 processes. Indeed addition of SP-A abolished production of the Th2 cytokines IL-4 and IL-5 by <italic>Af</italic>-stimulated lymphocytes. Thus, SP-A may act as a natural immunosuppressant in the lung with direct inhibitory actions on allergen-stimulated CD4+ Th2 lymphocytes.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>A transient decrease in airway levels of SP-A was associated with transcription of mRNA and release of the Th2-type cytokines IL-4 and IL-5 but not IFN-&#x003b3;. On the other hand, addition of SP-A to lymphocyte cultures from sensitized mice suppressed allergen-induced Th2-type immune response. We speculate that this lung collectin may play a protective role to prevent allergen-inhalation provoked immune reactions and propose the novel concept that a transient SP-A deficiency contributes to the pathogenesis of the allergic airway response.</p></sec><sec><title>List of abbreviations</title><p><italic>Af</italic>: Aspergillus fumigatus</p><p>AHR: Airway hyperresponsiveness</p><p>BAL: Bronchoalveolar lavage</p><p>CFSE: 5,6-carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester</p><p>cpm: Count per minute</p><p>ELISA: Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay</p><p>FACS: Fluorescence activated cell sorter</p><p>FITC: Fluorescein isothiocyanate</p><p>Ig: Immunoglobulin</p><p>IL: Interleukin</p><p>i.n.: Intranasal</p><p>i.p.: Intraperitoneal</p><p>LPS: Lipopolysaccharide</p><p>MBL: Mannose binding lectin</p><p>SP: Surfactant protein</p><p>PAP: Pulmonary Alveolar Proteinosis</p><p>PI: PMA and ionomycin</p><p>PMA: Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate</p><p>PBMC: Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells</p><p>Th: T helper</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>Seth Thomas Scanlon carried out the surfactant protein analysis and the protein and phospholipids measurements.
