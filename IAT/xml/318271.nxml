In this paper we describe the isolation of a Mup gene, Mup-1.5a, which is expressed predominantly in the submaxillary gland of BALB/c mice. We show that Mup-1.5a is a member of a subfamily consisting of two closely related genes, both of which are closely linked to the Mup-1 locus on mouse chromosome 4. Mup-1 is the locus of a class of Mup genes (Group 1) expressed in the liver. The complete nucleotide sequence of Mup-1.5a has been determined, and was compared to a previously sequenced Group 1 Mup gene. The comparison shows that the differentially expressed Mup genes are uniformly divergent in exons, introns and in their flanking sequences. The regions of homology extend at least 5 kb into the 5' flanking region of Mup genes.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00132-0313-a" xlink:role="6193"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00132-0314-a" xlink:role="6194"/></fig><fig id="F3"><graphic xlink:href="nar00132-0315-a" xlink:role="6195"/></fig><fig id="F4"><graphic xlink:href="nar00132-0315-b" xlink:role="6195"/></fig><fig id="F5"><graphic xlink:href="nar00132-0316-a" xlink:role="6196"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00132-0311.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6191"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00132-0312.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6192"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00132-0313.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6193"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00132-0314.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6194"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00132-0315.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6195"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00132-0316.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6196"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00132-0317.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6197"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00132-0318.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6198"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00132-0319.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6199"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00132-0320.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6200"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00132-0321.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6201"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00132-0322.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6202"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00132-0323.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6203"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
