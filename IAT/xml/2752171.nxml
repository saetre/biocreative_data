While levels of phospho-IGF-1R did not correlate with drug sensitivity, 4 out of 5 sensitive lines displayed high levels of total IGF-1R versus 1 out of 17 resistant lines (p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.003, Fisher's Exact). Sensitive lines also harbored higher copy numbers of <italic>IGF-1R</italic> as assessed by independent SNP array analysis. Addition of erlotinib or paclitaxel to R1507 led to further growth inhibition in sensitive but not resistant lines. In one <italic>EGFR</italic> mutant lung adenocarcinoma cell line (11&#x02013;18), R1507 and erlotinib co-treatment induced apoptosis, whereas treatment with either drug alone induced only cell cycle arrest. Apoptosis was mediated, in part, by the survival-related AKT pathway. Additionally, immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of total IGF-1R with an anti-total IGF-1R Ab (G11;Ventana) was performed on tissue microarrays (TMAs) containing 270 independent NSCLC tumor samples. Staining intensity was scored on a scale of 0 to 3&#x0002b;. 39.3&#x00025; of tumors showed medium to high IGF-1R IHC staining (scores of 2&#x0002b; or 3&#x0002b;, respectively), while 16.7&#x00025; had scores of 3&#x0002b;.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>In NSCLC cell lines, high levels of total IGF-1R are associated with moderate sensitivity to R1507.

This axis plays an important role in mammalian cell growth and development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007273-Pollak1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. The main components include the IGF-1R and its highly structurally conserved family member, the insulin receptor (IR). Both receptors consist of two half-receptors, each comprising one extracellular alpha-subunit and one transmembrane beta-subunit that possess tyrosine kinase activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007273-Adams1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. IGF-1Rs and IRs can homodimerize or form IGF-1R/IR heterodimers. While the IR is activated by insulin, IGF-1R is activated by its ligands, IGF-1 and IGF-II. The availability of IGF-1R ligands is additionally regulated by at least six high-affinity IGF-binding proteins (IGFBP1-6) which broadly function to inhibit IGF bioactivity.</p><p>The IGF-1R pathway appears to play important roles in tumorigenesis, metastasis, and resistance to existing forms of anti-cancer therapy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007273-Pollak1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007273-Adams1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>.

Specifically, we analyzed parameters that may be associated with sensitivity of 22 NSCLC lines to R1507 (RO4858696; Roche), a fully humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody directed against the extracellular portion of IGF-1R. It binds with high selectivity to the extracellular domain of IGF-1R (and not to IR), leading to displacement of IGF-1 binding and loss of protein at the cell surface due to receptor internalization and degradation. After identifying one potential biomarker, we analyzed signaling properties affected by anti-IGF-1R treatment in various cell lines and evaluated expression status of the biomarker in 270 NSCLC patient samples.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Cell culture</title><p>The human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines H3255, PC-9 and H1975 were described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007273-Gong1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. 11&#x02013;18 was kindly provided by Koichi Hagiwara.

The two main approaches involve anti-IGF-1R monoclonal antibodies and small molecule inhibitors. Currently, there is a limited amount of preclinical data regarding predictors of response to anti-IGF-1R therapy. In this study, through integrated analysis of 22 NSCLC cell lines, we identified high expression levels of total IGF-1R as one potential biomarker of sensitivity to R1507, an anti-IGF-1R antibody. 4 out of 5 sensitive lines displayed high levels of total IGF-1R versus 1 out of 17 resistant lines (p&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.003, Fisher's Exact). Consistent with this finding, others have recently reported that drug-sensitive sarcomas also have high expression of total IGF-1R <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007273-Cao1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>By contrast, we did not find that levels of phospho-IGF-1R were a predictive biomarker for R1507 sensitivity. Both R1507 sensitive cells and resistant cells showed variable levels of phospho-IGF-1R, regardless of culture conditions. This result may be due to the fact that IGF-1R phosphorylation status is a dynamic process which could have varied kinetic properties in different cell lines. We collected samples uniformly 15 mins after ligand stimulation, but peak IGF-1R phosphorylation following administration of IGF could occur at variable times in different cells.</p><p>We screened 22 human NSCLC cell lines and identified only 5 lines with moderate response to R1507 single agent treatment in vitro. Surprisingly, these &#x02018;drug-sensitive&#x02019; NSCLC cell lines did not undergo more than 25&#x02013;50&#x00025; growth inhibition or any significant apoptosis when treated with R1507 alone. We only used one method to assess such sensitivity (i.e. a growth inhibition assay). However, by contrast, the growth of <italic>EGFR</italic> mutant cells that harbor drug-sensitive EGFR kinase domain mutations is nearly completely blocked in this same assay, and apoptosis is induced after analogous treatment with gefitinib or erlotinib <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007273-Gong1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. This result suggests that at least among the drug-sensitive NSCLC cells we studied, IGF-1R activity alone is not required for maintenance of the tumor cells in vitro. The receptor does appear to contribute to cell survival, though. For example, 11&#x02013;18 cells, which harbor an erlotinib-sensitive EGFR mutation (L858R), undergo only G1 arrest in response to erlotinib but undergo apoptosis when co-treated with R1507 and erlotinib.</p><p>The lack of significant growth inhibition induced by R1507 in NSCLC cells can be further explained by two additional factors. First, IRs and IGF-1Rs can form hybrid receptors, and it is not yet clear how specific anti-IGF-1R-targeted therapies will interfere with signals emanating from hybrid receptors. However, use of agents that target both IR and IGF-1R was not the focus of this study. Second, we only assessed the effect of R1507 in vitro. R1507 does not elicit antibody-dependent cytotoxicity, but the antibody could still induce more dramatic responses in vivo.</p><p>Through analysis of EGFR, IGF-1R, and downstream MAPK and AKT signaling pathways, we found in the R1507-sensitive but not -resistant lines that IGF-1R activation is sufficient and required for AKT activation. Activation of IGF-1R by IGF-1 or inhibition of IGF-1R by R1507 had minimal effect on ERK activation in either R1507 sensitive or resistant lines. Thus, IGF-1R appears to be the major driving force for AKT activation in drug-sensitive cells. The dependence of AKT on IGF-1R signaling was further verified by knockdown of IGF-1R using siRNAs. Consistent with this finding, previous studies have shown in rhabdomyosarcoma cells that phospho-AKT status is controlled predominantly by IGF-1R activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007273-Cao1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>.

In future studies, it will be interesting to examine the roles of IRS-1 and ERBB3 in mediating PI3K/AKT activation in the R1507-sensitive and -resistant cells.</p><p>Through analysis of TMAs with another anti-IGF-1R antibody (G11), we found evidence for high total IGF-1R expression in primary human NSCLCs. 39.3&#x00025; of tumors had medium to high levels of IGF-1R expression (scores of 2&#x0002b; to 3&#x0002b;), while 16.7&#x00025; had high IGF-1R expression (scored as 3&#x0002b;). Higher levels of expression were associated with the squamous cell carcinoma subtype. There was no correlation with gender, smoking history, or overall survival. These results are consistent with a previous study with fewer numbers of patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007273-Ludovini1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In a randomized phase II study of patients with advanced treatment-na&#x000ef;ve NSCLC, disease in those with squamous cell carcinoma responded to the combination of paclitaxel, carboplatin and an anti-IGF-1R antibody (CP-751,871) better than those with other histological subtypes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007273-Karp2">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. In our IHC studies <bold>(</bold><xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0007273-t001"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref><bold>)</bold>, a majority of squamous cell lung cancers displayed high levels of IGF-1R expression. These data suggest that squamous cell lung cancers may be more sensitive than lung adenocarcinomas to IGF-1R targeted therapy. However, in our growth inhibition assays, only 1 out of 9 squamous cell carcinoma lines versus 4 out of 11 adenocarcinoma lines displayed moderate sensitivity to R1507. This discrepancy could possibly be explained by phenotypic changes that occur in squamous cell lines when they are grown in vitro. Lung adenocarcinoma cell lines and primary tumors were recently shown to be genetically and transcriptionally similar <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007273-Sos1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. However, an analogous analysis has not yet been performed for squamous cell lung cancer cell lines and primary tumors.</p><p>In summary, characterization of 22 NSCLC cell lines has lead to identification of high expression levels of total IGF-1R as a predictive marker of relative sensitivity to R1507, an anti-IGF-1R antibody. In such sensitive cells but not resistant cells, additive effects were observed by combining R1507 with other anti-cancer agents. Immunohistochemical analysis of primary NSCLC tumors with an anti-IGF-1R antibody demonstrated that a significant fraction display high levels of the receptor. These results lay groundwork for rationally designing clinical trials to enrich for lung cancer patients that might benefit from treatment with anti-IGF-1R antibodies like R1507.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0007273.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>R1507 binds to human IGF-1R. 500 micrograms of total protein from H3255 and 11&#x02013;18 cell lysates were incubated with 5 &#x000b5;g R1507 overnight followed by 2 hours incubation with protein A/G beads (Santa Cruz Biotechnology).
