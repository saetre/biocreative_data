F-box proteins bind substrates following their phosphorylation upon stimulation of various signaling pathways. Ubiquitin-mediated destruction of the fission yeast cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor Rum1p depends on two heterooligomerizing F-box proteins, Pop1p and Pop2p. Both proteins interact with the cullin Pcu1p when overexpressed, but it is unknown whether this reflects their co-assembly into <italic>bona fide</italic> SCF complexes.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We have identified Psh1p and Pip1p, the fission yeast homologues of human SKP1 and HRT1/RBX1/ROC1, and show that both associate with Pop1p, Pop2p, and Pcu1p into a ~500 kDa SCF<sup>Pop1p-Pop2p</sup> complex, which supports polyubiquitylation of Rum1p. Only the F-box of Pop1p is required for SCF<sup>Pop1p-Pop2p</sup> function, while Pop2p seems to be attracted into the complex through binding to Pop1p. Since all SCF<sup>Pop1p-Pop2p</sup> subunits, except for Pop1p, which is exclusively nuclear, localize to both the nucleus and the cytoplasm, the F-box of Pop2p may be critical for the assembly of cytoplasmic SCF<sup>Pop2p</sup> complexes. In support of this notion, we demonstrate individual SCF<sup>Pop1p</sup> and SCF<sup>Pop2p</sup> complexes bearing ubiquitin ligase activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our data suggest that distinct homo- and heterooligomeric assemblies of Pop1p and Pop2p generate combinatorial diversity of SCF<sup>Pop</sup> function in fission yeast. Whereas a heterooligomeric SCF<sup>Pop1p-Pop2p</sup> complex mediates polyubiquitylation of Rum1p, homooligomeric SCF<sup>Pop1p</sup> and SCF<sup>Pop2p</sup> complexes may target unknown nuclear and cytoplasmic substrates.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The ubiquitin/proteasome-dependent proteolysis system has been implicated in a wide variety of cellular regulatory mechanisms, including transcription, signal transduction, and cell cycle control (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]). The system employs a cascade of enzymatic reactions that lead to the covalent attachment of a chain of multiple ubiquitins to substrate proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. In many cases, modification by ubiquityl moieties targets proteins to the proteasome, ultimately resulting in their degradation. The ubiquitylation reaction involves a minimum of three enzymes: An E1, which mediates the ATP-dependent activation of ubiquitin, and an E2, or ubiquitin conjugating enzyme (UBC), which, together with an E3 ubiquitin ligase, transfers ubiquitin to the target protein. E3 enzymes are of particular interest, as they mediate the substrate specificity of ubiquitylation reactions.</p><p>Studies in budding yeast identified SCF<sup>Cdc4p</sup>, an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that mediates the ubiquitylation of the CDK inhibitor Sic1p [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. SCF<sup>Cdc4p</sup> consists of at least four proteins: the cullin Cdc53p, the RING domain protein Hrt1p/Rbx1p/Roc1p, the adapter protein Skp1p, and Cdc4p (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]). Cdc4p contains two sequence motifs, which are conserved in a wide variety of so-called F-box proteins: C-terminal WD-repeats that are involved in binding the substrate Sic1p in a phosphorylation-dependent manner, and a central F-box [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] that interacts with Skp1p [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Cdc53p in turn binds to Skp1p and Hrt1p/Rbx1p/Roc1p, which bridges Cdc53p with the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme Cdc34p/Ubc3p [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. <italic>In vitro</italic> reconstitution demonstrated that SCF<sup>Cdc4p</sup>, Cdc34p, E1, ubiquitin, and ATP are sufficient to mediate Sic1p polyubiquitylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>Components of the SCF system are widely conserved in eukaryotes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. In human cells, for example, SCF<sup>Skp2</sup> mediates destruction of the CDK inhibitor p27 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], while SCF<sup>&#x003b2;-TRCP</sup> targets I&#x003ba;B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. All of these SCF complexes share homologues of the core components CDC53/CUL1, SKP1, and HRT1/RBX1/ROC1, which associate with different F-box proteins.</p><p>Several lines of evidence suggest that the SCF pathway is also conserved in the fission yeast <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>. Pcu1p, a Cdc53p/CUL1-related protein, was shown to associate with two different F-box/WD repeat proteins, Pop1p and Pop2p, when overexpressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. In addition, genetic studies demonstrated that both of these F-box proteins are simultaneously required for efficient destruction of Rum1p and the replication initiator Cdc18p [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Rum1p is a Sic1p-analogous CDK inhibitor, which accumulates in G1, but is degraded as cells enter S phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Failure to degrade Rum1p is the major phenotypic defect of <italic>pop1</italic> and <italic>pop2</italic> deletion strains, which leads to disturbance of normal cell cycle progression, resulting in polyploidy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Based on the genetic data and the biochemical observation that Pop1p and Pop2p interact when overexpressed, a putative SCF<sup>Pop1p-Pop2p</sup> complex was proposed, which would contain the heterooligomerizing F-box proteins Pop1p and Pop2p bound to SCF core components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>Whether this unusual heterooligomeric SCF<sup>Pop1p-Pop2p</sup> complex exists <italic>in vivo</italic> and whether it mediates Rum1p ubiquitylation, remained unproven, as not all fission yeast SCF core subunits were identified. In addition, based on overexpression, distinct SCF<sup>Pop1p</sup> and SCF<sup>Pop2p</sup> complexes were proposed to target unknown substrates, but no biochemical evidence of their activity was provided [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. To address these questions, we cloned two additional subunits of SCF<sup>Pop</sup> and performed a detailed characterization of its activity <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Our results indicate that heterooligomeric SCF<sup>Pop1p-Pop2p</sup> mediates Rum1p ubiquitylation whereas distinct SCF<sup>Pop1p</sup> and SCF<sup>Pop2p</sup> complexes target unknown nuclear and cytoplasmic substrates, thereby generating combinatorial diversity of SCF function in fission yeast.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Composition of SCF<sup>Pop1p-Pop2p</sup></title><p>Based on the composition of known SCF complexes, we identified in the <italic>S. pombe</italic> genome database <italic>psh1</italic> (pombe skp1 homologue) and <italic>pip1</italic> (pop interacting protein 1), two genes encoding proteins with strong similarity to human SKP1 and HRT1/RBX1/ROC1, respectively (data not shown). Consistent with these proteins being components of the putative SCF<sup>Pop1p-Pop2p</sup> complex, they all co-purified with Pop1p, Pop2p, and Pcu1p when overexpressed pairwise (data not shown).</p><p>Co-immunoprecipitation experiments using affinity purified rabbit antisera confirmed these interactions at the level of the endogenous proteins. While each of the five antisera co-precipitated at least one of the other subunits, Pip1p, Pop1p, and Pop2p antisera co-precipitated all five proteins from wild-type cell lysate (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Size fractionation of total cell lysates prior to immunoprecipitation revealed co-elution of Pip1p with Pop1p, Pop2p, Pcu1p, and Psh1p in a high molecular weight complex of approximately 500 kDa, which we refer to as SCF<sup>Pop1p-Pop2p</sup> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). The composition of the core complex Pip1p/Pcu1p/Psh1p did not undergo major variations during the cell cycle (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). We have carefully reexamined potential cell cycle variations of Pcu1p neddylation apparent in the IP/immunoblotting experiment in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>. These variations were not seen when samples were denatured in SDS immediately following extract preparation (data not shown), suggesting that they arise from varying degrees of deneddylation presumably occuring during the immunoprecipitation step. In addition, in a separate experiment, Pop1p-Pop2p heterooligomerization was largely constant during the cell cycle (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). These findings indicated that cell cycle-dependent substrate degradation is unlikely to be controlled at the level of SCF<sup>Pop1p-Pop2p</sup> complex formation.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>SCF<sup>Pop</sup> protein interactions</bold> (<bold>1A</bold>) SCF<sup>Pop</sup> complex formation at endogenous expression levels. Lysate prepared from wild-type fission yeast cells was used for immunoprecipitation with affinity-purified rabbit antisera directed against SCF subunits as indicated. Precipitates were separated by SDS gel electrophoresis and co-precipitating proteins were detected by immunoblotting with the antisera indicated in each panel. Note that Pip1p, Pop1p, and Pop2p antisera precipitated all five SCF<sup>Pop</sup> subunits (lane 1). The control lane (6) contained an immunoprecipitate prepared with antisera depleted of Pip1p antibodies (flowthrough of the affinity column &#x02013; FT).

Samples were taken after the indicated times and prepared for immunoprecipitation with Pip1p (top panel) or Pop2p (bottom panel) antibodies. Precipitates were probed for co-purification of SCF subunits with the indicated antisera. Pcu1p is resolved into two bands, presumably representing native and Ned8p-modified species. The percentage of septate cells, which represent cells in S phase, was determined at each time point and blotted against time as illustrated in the graph.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2091-3-22-1"/></fig></sec><sec><title>SCF<sup>Pop1p-Pop2p</sup> mediates polyubiquitylation of Rum1p <italic>in vitro</italic></title><p>Genetic experiments suggested that degradation of Rum1p depends on the Pop1p and Pop2p F-box proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], but also requires phosphorylation of Rum1p on serine 58 and threonine 62 by cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Thus, phosphorylated Rum1p may be a substrate for SCF<sup>Pop1p-Pop2p</sup>-mediated polyubiquitylation. To test this, we first confirmed that Rum1p is an <italic>in vitro</italic> substrate for the Cdc2p kinase in association with the cyclin Cig1p [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] as judged by a mobility shift on SDS gels (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). Bacterially expressed Rum1p purified to apparent homogeneity was also efficiently phosphorylated by Cdc2p/Cig1p complexes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>SCF<sup>Pop1p-Pop2p</sup> mediated Rum1p ubiquitylation <italic>in vitro</italic></bold> (<bold>2A</bold>) Various Cdc2p complexes were affinity purified from cells co-expressing 6 &#x000d7; His-Myc-tagged Cdc2p and HA-tagged cyclins on nickel NTA resin.

Reactions only containing buffer were used as negative controls (lanes denoted "-"). Reaction products were separated on SDS gels and detected by fluorography (left panel). Both, Cdc2p/Cdc13p and Cdc2p/Cig1p produced a shift in Rum1p migration indicative of phosphorylation, although it is unclear whether both kinases target the same residues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. In a confirmatory experiment, bacterially expressed Rum1p was purified to apparent homogeneity by column chromatography as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] (middle panel), and phosphorylated by incubation with Cdc2p/Cig1p complexes in the presence of radiolabeled ATP (right panel). Reaction products were separated by SDS gel electrophoresis and detected by autoradiography.

Bound complexes were incubated with bacterially expressed phosphorylated Rum1p. After the incubation, beads were washed extensively, followed by boiling in SDS sample buffer and electrophoresis. Rum1p bound to Pop1p-Pop2p was visualized by autoradiography (lane 1, top panel). As controls, 6 &#x000d7; His-tagged Pop1p or Pop2p individually overexpressed in <italic>pop1 pop2</italic> double mutants were employed in the Rum1p binding assay (lanes 2, and 3; top panel).

Bacterially expressed, phosphorylated Rum1p, derived from the preparation shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref> was incubated with Pip1p complexes immunopurified from the indicated strains, human E1, UBC3 (hUBC3), ATP, and ubiquitin for 90 min at 30&#x000b0;C. Reactions were stopped by the addition of SDS sample buffer, and reaction products were separated by SDS PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. Lanes 2, 4, and 6 included mutant UBC3 in which the catalytic cysteine residue was replaced (UBC3-&#x00394;Cys). Mutant ubiquitin, in which all lysine residues were replaced by arginine was present in lane 7. The assays presented in the right panel (lanes 8 &#x02013; 11) were performed with Pip1p complexes purified from <italic>csn5</italic> mutants and contained the indicated human or <italic>S. pombe</italic> UBCs.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2091-3-22-2"/></fig><p>To determine whether phosphorylated Rum1p interacts with Pop1p and Pop2p, protein lysate was prepared from cells co-overexpressing epitope-tagged combinations of Pop1p and Pop2p. Upon affinity purification on Ni-NTA resin, HA-Pop1p/His-Myc-Pop2p complexes were incubated with bacterially expressed, phosphorylated Rum1p. In this reaction, Pop1p-Pop2p complexes specifically bound phosphorylated Rum1p (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, lane 1). Consistent with the genetic data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], His-Myc-Pop1p and His-Myc-Pop2p individually purified upon overexpression in <italic>pop1 pop2</italic> double mutants exhibited no Rum1p binding above background (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>, lanes 2 and 3).</p><p>Given our ability to prepare immunopurified SCF<sup>Pop1p-Pop2p</sup> that bound phosphorylated Rum1p, we sought to reconstitute Rum1p polyubiquitylation <italic>in vitro.</italic> In addition, we required an ubiquitin activating enzyme (E1) and an ubiquitin conjugating enzyme (UBC). While human E1 is highly similar to its fission yeast counterpart (data not shown), inspection of the <italic>S. pombe</italic> genome revealed fourteen potential UBCs, none of which is an obvious homologue of human UBC3 or budding yeast Cdc34p, since all lack the characteristic C-terminal extension (data not shown). We therefore purified recombinant human E1 and UBC3 (CDC34) upon expression in bacteria (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>).</p><p>In the presence of human E1, UBC3, ubiquitin, and ATP, SCF<sup>Pop1p-Pop2p</sup> complexes immunopurified with Pip1p antibodies converted a small portion of phosphorylated Rum1p into high molecular weight species (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>). This conversion was dependent on the addition of E1, ATP (data not shown), and wild-type UBC3 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>, lanes 2,4,6). The activity of SCF<sup>Pop1p/Pop2p</sup> was augmented when Pip1p complexes where purified from <italic>csn5</italic> mutants (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>, lane 5). This mutant accumulates Pcu1p exclusively in a form carrying the stimulatory Nedd8p modification, due to a defect in COP9/signalosome-mediated cullin deneddylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Replacing wild-type ubiquitin by a mutant lacking all lysine residues prevented the formation of high molecular weight products (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>, lane 7), indicating that they represent polyubiquitylated Rum1p species generated in the reaction. Similar polyubiquitylated reaction products were detected upon incubation of phosphorylated Rum1p with Pcu1p immunocomplexes, further suggesting that the activity is mediated by SCF<sup>Pop1p-Pop2p</sup> (data not shown). Moreover, Rum1p ubiquitylation was not obtained with Pip1p complexes prepared from cell lysate of <italic>pop2</italic> deletion strains, proving the F-box protein dependency of this reaction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>, lane 3). In addition, the reaction was specific for human UBC3, as no ubiquitylation was obtained with fission yeast Ubc1p, Ubc7p, Ubc11p, or Ubc13p (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, lanes 10,11). Taken together these results strongly suggest that SCF<sup>Pop1p-Pop2p</sup> mediates the polyubiquitylation of CDK phosphorylated Rum1p <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Differential subcellular localization of SCF<sup>Pop1p-Pop2p</sup> subunits</title><p>The co-purification of the five identified SCF<sup>Pop1p-Pop2p</sup> subunits and their <italic>in vitro</italic> activity toward Rum1p suggested that they coexist in a common subcellular compartment. The nuclear localization of the only known substrates, Cdc18p [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] and Rum1p (D.A.W., unpublished), indicated that a substantial portion of SCF<sup>Pop1p-Pop2p</sup> is enriched in the nucleus. To test this assumption, all five SCF<sup>Pop1p-Pop2p</sup> subunits were expressed as fusion proteins with green fluorescent protein (GFP) at low levels from an inducible pRep81 plasmid. While Pip1p, Psh1p, Pcu1p, and Pop2p were present in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus, surprisingly, GFP-Pop1p was largely restricted to the nucleus (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>).

Although both fractions showed some contamination, Pop1p was detected mostly in nuclear fractions, while Pop2p was apparent in both nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>).

For this, we created a <italic>pop2</italic> deletion strain carrying Pop1p modified with 13 Myc epitope tags at the endogenous genomic locus (<italic>pop1-13myc &#x00394;pop2 strain</italic>). In addition, we created the reciprocal <italic>pop2-13myc &#x00394;pop1</italic> strain containing epitope-tagged endogenous Pop2p in a <italic>pop1</italic> deletion background. The distinct localization patterns of Pop1p-13Myc and Pop2p-13Myc were fully maintained in these strains (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E</xref>). This observation was confirmed by overexpressing GFP-tagged Pop1p or Pop2p in <italic>pop1 pop2</italic> double deletion mutants (data not shown).

In addition, Rum1p accumulation in <italic>pop1</italic> mutants was efficiently reversed by wild-type Pop1p (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>). In contrast, Pop1p lacking its F-box (Pop1p-&#x00394;F) or Pop1p, in which the F-box was replaced by the F-box of Pop2p (Pop1p-2F) were largely inactive in both assays (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C,4D</xref>).

The same wild-type and mutant proteins also reversed the mild polyploidy phenotype of <italic>pop2</italic> disruptants (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). Thus, in contrast to Pop1p, Pop2p does not seem, to require its F-box to mediate Rum1p degradation <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>To further substantiate this conclusion, we examined Rum1p protein stability in wild-type and <italic>pop</italic> mutant strains expressing F-box-deleted Pop proteins from the weak pRep81 promoter. Since the sensitivity of our Rum1p sera was insufficient to detect the low levels present in wild-type cells (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>, lane 9), these experiments were conducted in a background where endogenous Rum1p was modified with 13 C-terminal c-Myc epitope tags.

Consistent with this hypothesis, co-immunoprecipitation experiments of overexpressed proteins revealed that the Pop1p-Pop2p interaction occurs independently of the F-boxes of both Pop1p and Pop2p (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>Pop protein interactions</bold> (<bold>6A</bold>) Tagged versions of Pop1p and Pop2p F-box deletion and swap mutants were overexpressed in wild-type cells as indicated. 6xHis-Myc-tagged proteins were absorbed to Ni-NTA-agarose and co-purifying HA-tagged proteins were detected by immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies.

To exclude this possibility, we asked whether distinct SCF<sup>Pop1p</sup> and SCF<sup>Pop2p</sup> complexes bear ubiquitin ligase activity <italic>in vitro</italic>. To this end, we performed <italic>in vitro</italic> ubiquitylation assays.

Although the crystal structure of the SKP1&#x02013;SKP2 complex, derived from bacterially expressed proteins, revealed a single SKP2 monomer bound to SKP1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], biochemical studies showed that budding yeast Cdc4p, a close homologue of Pop1p\Pop2p, forms homooligomers when expressed in insect cells (Correll and Deshaies, personal communication). Similarly, &#x003b2;-TRCP1 and 2, which target I&#x003ba;B&#x003b1; for degradation as homooligomers, form heterooligomers that each bind SCF core subunits, although no biochemical activity for this heterooligomeric complex was demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Finally, Pop1p and Pop2p homooligomerize, at least when overexpressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], indicating that both F-box proteins may also be present as homooligomers in individual SCF<sup>Pop1p</sup> and SCF<sup>Pop2p</sup>, respectively.</p><p>A surprising finding of this study was that the F-box of Pop2p is dispensable for Rum1p degradation and ploidy control, while the F-box of Pop1p is essential for both functions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). The Pop2p F-box is unlikely to be a degenerate, non-functional, and hence dispensable, motif, as it carries all signature residues of the F-box (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). In addition, Pop2p, in the absence of Pop1p, assembles into a complex containing all SCF core subunits identified here (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>). At present, we cannot exclude that residues outside the F-box mediate binding of F-box deleted Pop2p to Psh1p and other core subunits. Consistent with this idea, biochemical studies based on the crystal structure of the human SKP1&#x02013;SKP2 complex revealed cooperation of the SKP2 F-box with an adjacent region in binding of SKP1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Consistent with this finding, certain truncation mutants of the budding yeast F-box proteins Grr1p and Cdc4p interact poorly with Skp1p, despite the retainment of their F-boxes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. On the other hand, the F-box of Pop1p is essential for Rum1p degradation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>), arguing that residues outside the F-box are insufficient to mediate recruitment of Pop proteins into SCF complexes.</p><p>Based on the non-essential function of the Pop2p F-box, we propose a molecular architecture of SCF<sup>Pop1p-Pop2p</sup>, in which Pop2p is tethered to the core subunits through interaction with Pop1p. Although we have no direct biochemical evidence to confirm this proposition, which would require Pop2p point mutants deficient in Pop1p binding, our data show that severely truncated N-terminal fragments of Pop1p and Pop2p lacking both F-boxes and WD repeat domains are sufficient to mediate their interaction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). Similarly, dimerization of &#x003b2;-TRCP proteins is mediated by N-terminal "D-domains" lacking binding of SKP1 and other SCF core subunits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. According to our model, the F-box of Pop2p would be essential only for the Pop1p-independent activities of Pop2p, for which we provide tentative evidence by demonstrating the <italic>in vivo</italic> assembly of SCF<sup>Pop2p</sup> complexes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>). These complexes bear ubiquitin ligase activity in a substrate-independent <italic>in vitro</italic> assay (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7C</xref>). To what extent this assay reflects the <italic>in vivo</italic> activity of SCF<sup>Pop2p</sup> will become testable, once the putative substrates of SCF<sup>Pop2p</sup> are identified.</p></sec><sec><title>Subcellular compartmentalization of SCF<sup>Pop</sup> as a potential mechanism for substrate selection</title><p>Another surprising observation of this study was that Pop1p is primarily localized to the nucleus, whereas Pop2p is present in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). While, nuclear localization was expected, since both known substrates of SCF<sup>Pop1p-Pop2p</sup>, Cdc18p and Rum1p, are primarily nuclear proteins, the cytoplasmic localization of Pop2p suggests an activity of SCF<sup>Pop2p</sup> directed toward unknown cytoplasmic substrates. In support of this notion, as with human SCF subunits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], fission yeast SCF core subunits are also present in the cytoplasm, as shown here for overexpressed GFP-fusions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>), and for endogenous Pcu1p by immunostaining in a previous report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>By analogy, additional nuclear substrates of SCF<sup>Pop1p</sup> may exist. For example, Pop1p is involved in the control of the RNA levels of the cyclin Cig2p [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. While it is unclear whether this effect is mediated at the level of transcription or mRNA stability, the budding yeast F-box protein Met30p was recently shown to regulate the ubiquitylation and activity, but not degradation, of the transcription factor Met4p [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. In addition, <italic>pop1</italic> mutants display an increased rate of chromosome loss, a phenotype that is not easily explained by accumulation of Rum1p and Cdc18p [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Finally, <italic>pop1</italic> mutants are sensitive to UV irradiation, whereas <italic>pop2</italic> mutants are not (D. Griffiths and D.A.W., unpublished observation). It is therefore likely that other substrates of Pop1p and Pop2p, in addition to their common substrates Cdc18p and Rum1p, do exist.</p><p>The idea developed above that F-box protein compartmentalization contributes to substrate selection was recently confirmed directly for Cdc4p-mediated degradation of Far1p in budding yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Both, Cdc4p and Far1p are nuclear proteins in vegetative cells, owing to the presence of nuclear localization signals (NLS). Fusion of Cdc4p with a nuclear export signal (NES-Cdc4p) prevented its nuclear localization and its ability to direct the degradation of nuclear Far1p. When Far1p also was targeted to the cytoplasm by disrupting its NLS, NES-Cdc4p degraded &#x00394;NLS-Far1p in the cytoplasm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].</p><p>A putative NLS is also present in the N-terminus of Pop1p located between the F-box and the WD-repeat domain (<sup>393</sup>PEKIKRC). An N-terminal Pop1p fragment containing this motif, when fused to the WD-repeat region of Pop2p, is targeted exclusively to the nucleus (R.L. &#x00026; D.A.W., unpublished observation). Like wild-type Pop2p, the reverse Pop2p-N/Pop1p-C chimera localizes to both the nucleus and the cytoplasm, again indicating that Pop1p, but not Pop2p, has a functional NLS in its N-terminus (R.L. &#x00026; D.A.W., unpublished observation). It is unclear, at present, what regulates Pop2p distribution. One possibility is that Pop2p is co-imported in a complex with other SCF subunits that is preformed in the cytoplasm. Since Pop2p distribution is independent of Pop1p (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E</xref>), SCF core subunits are the most likely candidates for such a function. In line with this suggestion, it was previously demonstrated that HRT1/ROC1/RBX1 promotes nuclear accumulation of CUL1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our data suggest homo- and heterooligomerization of the F-box proteins Pop1p and Pop2p as a mechanism for generating combinatorial diversity of SCF function in fission yeast.

Cells were resuspended in buffer S, 1 mM PMSF, 10 mM &#x003b2;-mercaptoethanol and incubated for 10 min at 30&#x000b0;C. Cells were pelleted, resuspended in 4 pellet volumes of buffer S, 1 mM PMSF, Zymolyase (100 ug/ml) and incubated at 30&#x000b0;C for 40 min. Cells were diluted in buffer S and pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in buffer F (18 % Ficoll 400, w/v; 20 mM HEPES (pH = 7.2), 0.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and protease inhibitors. Cells were lysed by homogenization using a teflon pestel fitted into a microfuge tube. Cell lysis was monitored by microscopy. Unlysed cells were pelleted by gentle centrifugation. The lysate was placed on top of buffer GF (7% Ficoll 400, w/v, 20% glycerol, 20 mM HEPES (pH = 7.2), 0.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>). Nuclei were pelleted by spinning at 7000 rpm in a microfuge.
