A &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test was used for comparison of group frequencies. Survival analysis was used to estimate the effect of genetic variants (risk and non-risk genotypes defined from previous studies) on the risk of developing T2D and shown by Kaplan&#x02013;Meier survival curves as the distribution of age at onset (the proportion of individuals developing T2D at certain age). The risk of developing T2D was expressed as a hazard function (the negative slope divided by the survival curve) using an age-adjusted Cox proportional hazard regression model &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020345-b34">34</xref>&#x0005d;. The hazard function is the (conditional) probability for the development of diabetes during a time interval divided by the length of that time interval, for an individual that is diabetes-free at the start of the time interval. The relative effect is presented as the ratio between the hazard functions (hazard ratio &#x0005b;HR&#x0005d;) of the two groups. HRs quantify the effect size of both discrete variables (carriers versus non-carriers) and continuous variables (used in the interaction analysis below where HR measures the effect of an increase in one unit of the continuous variable). All survival analyses were stratified for gender and adjusted for family history of diabetes and BMI (when appropriate). The information that an individual did not or did belong to a nuclear family with at least one other affected member was coded as zero or one, respectively, and used as a covariate in the Cox regression analyses. All survival analyses were performed with a robust variance estimate to adjust for within family dependence extended to the large pedigrees. In using a robust variance estimate we treated each pedigree (instead of each individual) as an independent entity for calculating the variance of the estimates.</p><p>Expected risk genotypes were defined according to earlier reports (PP genotype of <italic>PPARG,</italic> GG genotype of <italic>CAPN10</italic> SNP43, TT genotype of <italic>CAPN10</italic> SNP44, EK/KK genotypes of <italic>KCNJ11,</italic> GR/RR genotypes of <italic>IRS1,</italic> GG genotype of <italic>UCP2</italic>).

Therefore, in the present study we refer to the TT genotype of <italic>CAPN10</italic> SNP44 as an at-risk genotype. Individuals with missing data were excluded from the analyses.</p><p>Analyses of interaction between effect of phenotype <italic>(P)</italic> defined as insulin secretion (disposition index) and insulin action (HOMA<sub>IR</sub>) and genotype <italic>(G)</italic> (1 = risk and 0 = non-risk) on age at onset of T2D were performed using the following Cox proportional hazards model: h(<italic>t</italic>) = h<sub>0</sub>(<italic>t</italic>)exp(&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub><italic>P</italic> + &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub><italic>G</italic> + &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub><italic>P</italic>&#x0002a;<italic>G</italic>), in which h(<italic>t</italic>) is the hazard function and h<sub>0</sub>(<italic>t</italic>) is the baseline hazard function, with &#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> and &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub> measuring the univariate effects and &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> measuring the interaction. If there is an interaction (&#x003b2;<sub>3</sub> &#x02260; 0), the HR for carriers and non-carriers of the risk genotype will not be the same. Thus, in different genotype carriers the HR of T2D associated with <italic>x</italic> units increase/decrease in the phenotypic value <italic>(P</italic> + <italic>x)</italic> is HR = exp(&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub> + &#x003b2;<sub>3</sub>)&#x0002a;<italic>x</italic> for the risk genotype carriers and HR = exp(&#x003b2;<sub>1</sub>&#x0002a;<italic>x</italic>) for the non-risk genotype carriers. A logistic regression analysis was applied to explore the relationship between FPG and BMI, with genetic factor (defined as 1 = risk and 0 = non-risk) as dependent variable and FPG, BMI, and an interaction term as covariates.

A question often raised about genetic association studies of polygenic diseases is whether the information can be used to predict the disease, since the risk conferred by the variant is usually rather modest (odds ratio &#x0003c; 1.2&#x02013;1.3) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020345-b06">6</xref>&#x0005d;. In T2D association studies, cases are usually ascertained through diabetes clinics and thereby possibly enriched by carriers of more severe genetic variants. It was therefore encouraging to see that polymorphisms in some genes previously shown to be associated with T2D in case-control studies (particularly P12A in <italic>PPARG</italic> and SNP44 in <italic>CAPN10</italic>) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020345-b04">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020345-b15">15</xref>&#x0005d; could predict T2D in high risk individuals from families with T2D.</p><p>The relative risk (&#x003bb;<sub>s</sub>) of developing T2D for members of the Botnia families is about three.

Replacing the family history with the <italic>PPARG</italic> and <italic>CAPN10</italic> variants, and particularly with their combination, gave almost the same strong prediction of subsequent T2D. These genotypes also influenced the relationship between BMI and FPG, i.e., in carriers of the risk genotypes there was a steeper increase in FPG for any given increase in BMI.</p><p>Several papers have examined the effect of single gene variants on the risk of conversion to T2D in interventional trials like the Finnish Diabetes Prevention Study &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020345-b09">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020345-b17">17</xref>&#x0005d; and the STOP-NIDDM trial &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0020345-b11">11</xref>&#x0005d;.

This effect was restricted to the control group, whereas the few A12A carriers in the intervention group lost more weight than the P12P carriers.

It is therefore possible that the protective effect of the A allele is attenuated in very obese individuals.

Although there could be several possible explanations for this discrepancy, a likely explanation is the accuracy by which the cases (converters) and controls (non-converters) were defined in the prospective study as compared with a case-control association study. In the prospective study all individuals underwent repeated OGTTs to define glucose tolerance status, while in case-control studies the definition of normal glucose tolerance is often based upon one OGTT. Therefore, we assume that we have a certain proportion of controls misclassified. We simulated (1,000 times) this situation by introducing 5&#x00025;, 10&#x00025;, and 20&#x00025; misclassification of non-converters regarding the HR of 1.72 for the P12A polymorphism in the <italic>PPARG</italic> gene to predict future diabetes. A 5&#x00025; misclassification would result in a decrease in HR to 1.31 (minimum 0.85; maximum 1.97), 10&#x00025; to 1.18 (minimum 0.84; maximum 1.68), and 20&#x00025; to 1.08 (minimum 0.82; maximum 1.38). Of course, there also could be other factors contributing, such as change in diabetes prevalence (which almost doubled) between the time when the cases in the case-control study and the converters in the prospective study were diagnosed.

They found that changes in two of the genes, <italic>PPARG</italic> (which is involved in how the body regulates fat tissue) and <italic>CAPN10</italic> (which is involved in modifying certain proteins), were associated with people having a higher chance of getting type 2 diabetes. This chance was increased substantially when the participants already had slightly raised blood glucose, and a high body mass index.</p></sec><sec id="sb1d"><title>What Do These Findings Mean?</title><p>In some people, it does seem possible to use certain genes to predict whether a person will develop type 2 diabetes.
