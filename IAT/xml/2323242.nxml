Human neocentromeres have acquired CENP-A chromatin epigenetically in ectopic chromosomal locations on low-copy complex DNA.

Analysis of two neocentromeres using a contiguous bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) microarray spanning bands 13q31.3 to 13q33.1 shows that both CENP-C and CENP-H co-localize to the CENP-A chromatin domain. Using a higher resolution polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplicon microarray spanning the neocentromere, we find that the CENP-A chromatin is discontinuous, consisting of a major domain of about 87.8 kilobases (kb) and a minor domain of about 13.2 kb, separated by an approximately 158 kb region devoid of CENPs. Both CENP-A domains exhibit co-localization of CENP-C and CENP-H, defining a distinct inner kinetochore chromatin structure that is consistent with higher order chromatin looping models at centromeres. The PCR microarray data suggested varying density of CENP-A nucleosomes across the major domain, which was confirmed using a higher resolution oligo-based microarray.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Centromeric chromatin consists of several CENP-A subdomains with highly discontinuous CENP-A chromatin at both the level of individual nucleosomes and at higher order chromatin levels, raising questions regarding the overall structure of centromeric chromatin.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The centromere, which is the chromosome component that is responsible for the proper segregation of sister chromatids to daughter cells during cell division, is a specialized chromatin structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Centromeric chromatin has a distinctive nucleosome structure that contains the histone H3 variant centromere protein (CENP)-A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. CENP-A containing chromatin associates with a large number of proteins, which are assembled in a hierarchical manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Essential among the proximal proteins are several associated with the centromere throughout the cell cycle, such as CENP-C (a DNA-binding protein) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and CENP-H (necessary for CENP-C loading) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. These proteins provide the platform onto which the mitotic kinetochore is assembled, with CENP-A potentially providing the epigenetic mark that specifies centromere formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>Immunofluorescence studies of extended chromatin fibers at human endogenous centromeres have demonstrated that human centromeres are formed by discontinuous CENP-A nucleosome domains of about 15 to 40 kilobases (kb), interspersed with nucleosome domains containing modified histone H3 dimethylated at Lys4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. These domains form on arrays of 0.5 to 1.5 megabases (Mb) of a family of tandemly repeated DNA called alpha satellite [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], binding primarily to the alpha I subset of these sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. In metaphase chromosomes it has been postulated that the histone H3 domains face inward toward regions of sister chromatid cohesion, whereas the CENP-A domains face poleward and assemble the kinetochore [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>Human neocentromeres are variant centromeres that have arisen epigenetically on low-copy complex genomic DNA. Over 75 cases have been reported on derivatives of at least 19 different human chromosomes, identified mainly through clinical chromosomal analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. They assemble fully functional kinetochores with the sole absence of CENP-B, which is known to bind alpha satellite DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Thus, they have been used as a model system in which to study the underlying centromeric chromatin in the absence of repetitive alpha satellite DNA. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) microarrays, the CENP-A chromatin domain of six different neocentromeres has been described. These range from 130 kb to 460 kb in size, which is about twofold to threefold smaller than alpha satellite DNA arrays found at endogenous centromeres [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. In addition, the CENP-C chromatin domain was described on a seventh neocentromere to an approximately 54 kb domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. ChIP and BAC microarray analysis of multiple independent neocentromeres that formed in so-called neocentromere 'hotspots' [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>], specifically three from band 13q32 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] and two from band 13q21 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], show that they formed in distinct genomic regions separated by up to several megabases, suggesting little role for primary DNA sequence determinants in neocentromere formation. Further analysis of a neocentromere in band 10q25 (the mardel10 chromosome) using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplicon microarray (with an average fragment size of 8 kb) has demonstrated that CENP-A nucleosomes at this neocentromere are organized into seven distinct CENP-A subdomains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p><p>In this study we have analyzed the binding sites for CENP-A, CENP-C, and CENP-H in human neocentromeres from band 13q32, using BAC, PCR-amplicon, and oligonucleotide-type genomic microarrays. BAC microarray analysis of two neocentromeres showed that both CENP-C and CENP-H co-localized to the same chromatin domain as CENP-A. The high-resolution PCR-amplicon microarray analysis reported here showed that a 130 kb CENP-A domain previously indicated by low-resolution BAC microarray analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] actually consisted of an approximately 87.8 kb major domain and an approximately 13.2 kb minor domain, separated by about 158 kb. Both domains contained co-localizing CENP-A, CENP-C, and CENP-H, indicating a distinct inner kinetochore chromatin structure. Analysis of CENP-A ChIP DNA hybridized to a high-resolution 70 mer oligonucleotide microarray containing two regions within the major domain showed that the density of CENP-A nucleosomes may be highly variable in some regions within the neocentromeric domains.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Co-localization of CENP-A, CENP-C, and CENP-H positions on two independent 13q32/33 neocentromeres</title><p>We sought to determine the DNA localization of the two constitutive centromere proteins CENP-C and CENP-H relative to CENP-A domains at neocentromeres. Cell line BBB contains an inverted duplication chromosome with a breakpoint in band 13q21 (invdup13q21) and a neocentromere in band 13q33.1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].

To identify the CENP-C domain in this cell line, CENP-C ChIP was performed on formaldehyde cross-linked BBB extracts (see Materials and methods, below) and the DNA hybridized to contiguous BAC microarrays spanning chromosome bands 13q32 and 13q33.2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). BAC RP11-46I10 showed a highly significant positive signal and BAC RP11-29B2 was slightly positive, but not above the cut-off for statistical significance (dashed line, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>). This pattern was similar to the pattern previously seen for CENP-A ChIP in this cell line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].

Shown across the bottom of the graph is the tiling path of the unique sequenced regions for each BAC, the previously determined CENP-A domains [32] in cell lines BBB and IMS13q, and the genes in the region.

For cell line IMS13q, the CENP-A mapped to two contiguous BACs (RP11-721F4 and RP11-199B17), whereas CENP-C and CENP-H mapped only to one BAC (RP11-199B17).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gb-2007-8-7-r148-1"/></fig><p>CENP-H ChIP was also performed on formaldehyde cross-linked BBB extracts, and the DNA hybridized to the BAC microarrays. Again, BAC RP11-46I10 gave an enhanced signal, and BAC RP11-29B2 gave a positive but weaker signal that was not above the cut-off for statistical significance (dashed line, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>). The alpha satellite control also gave a highly significant positive signal. The exact correlation of BAC hybridization for CENP-A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], CENP-C, and CENP-H indicate the precise co-localization of these three inner kinetochore proteins at this neocentromere at the resolution of this microarray. As a negative control, both CENP-C and CENP-H ChIPs derived from either HeLa (no neocentromere) or CHOP13q (neocentromere in 13q21) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] showed no positive hybridization signal in this microarray except for the alpha satellite positive control (data not shown).</p><p>To assess this co-localization in an independent neocentromere cell line, CENP-C and CENP-H ChIP were performed on cell line IMS13q, which has an invdup 13q21 chromosome with a neocentromere in band 13q32.1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. The CENP-A domain in this neocentromere was previously localized using CENP-A ChIP to a 215 kb domain approximately 5 Mb proximal to that of BBB (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>), based on the positive signal at two contiguous BACs, RP11-721F14 and RP11-199B17 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. For both the CENP-C and CENP-H ChIP, BAC RP11-199B17, but not RP11-721F4, was positive (the alpha satellite controls were also positive; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>). These data indicate that CENP-A, CENP-C, and CENP-H also co-localize at this neocentromere. However, the lack of detectable hybridization of CENP-C and CENP-H at BAC RP11-721F14 suggest an approximately 70 kb domain where CENP-A, CENP-C, and CENP-H co-localize, with the CENP-A domain extending an additional 146 kb (based on the BAC overlaps; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1c</xref>). However, given the lower efficiency of immunoprecipitation of CENP-C and CENP-H associated DNA compared with CENP-A, we cannot determine whether smaller domains of CENP-C and CENP-H are also found on BAC RP11-721F14 that correspond to the CENP-A signal (see below). These data show that the both CENP-C and CENP-H proteins co-localize with the histone variant CENP-A chromatin domains at two independent human neocentromeres.</p></sec><sec><title>CENP-A chromatin in the BBB neocentromere is organized into two distinct domains</title><p>In order to further analyze the organization of the 130 kb CENP-A chromatin domain at the BBB neocentromere, a microarray that increases the resolution of this region by about 200-fold was constructed.

Primer pairs were designed in the unique DNA sequences located between the interspersed repetitive DNA in this region. PCR products ranged in size from 173 base pairs (bp) to 942 bp in length, with a mean value of 588 bp. A set of 133 PCR products were designed to saturate the 350 kb region that includes the sequences in BACs RP11-811P12, RP11-46I10, and RP11-29B2, with an average spacing of about 2 kb (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2d</xref>). The remaining 124 primer pairs were designed to cover about 1 Mb on either side of the 350 kb region, positioned at regular intervals with increasing spacing from 10 kb to 30 kb as they moved away from the central 350 kb region (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2d</xref>; also see Material and methods, below).

Positive intensity ratios were determined using a one-tailed distribution analysis (dashed line, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref>; see Materials and methods, below) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. These CENP-A domains did not coincide with the original prediction of 130 kb domain based on the BACs overlaps (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Instead, the PCR microarray indicated two distinct domains of CENP-A chromatin: a major domain of about 80.3 kb in size and a minor domain of about 8.5 kb (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref>). The major domain was located within the unique sequence of BAC RP11-46I10 and accounted for the strong hybridization signal to this BAC on BAC microarrays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. The minor domain was delineated by three neighboring PCR fragments, 91, 92 and 93 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2d</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). It is approximately 162 kb downstream of the major domain at the distal end of BAC RP11-29B2 and not within the region that overlaps with BAC RP11-46I10. This minor domain accounts for the weak but consistent hybridization signal seen for BAC RP11-29B2 on BAC microarrays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. As a negative control, CENP-A ChIP derived from cell line CHOP13q [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] showed no positive hybridization signal in this microarray except for the alpha satellite positive control (data not shown).</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>PCR microarray and qRT-PCR values across the CENP-A major and minor

Thirty-four PCR primer pairs were used to amplify fragments of about 200 bp across the 350 kb region, which confirmed the presence of both the major and minor CENP-A domains and intervening regions, and validated the PCR microarray results (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Some differences were observed between the PCR microarray and the qRT-PCR analysis, especially from fragments near the edges of the domains and fragments that showed relatively low intensity ratios within the major domain. The three PCR microarray fragments 1, 2, and 3 on the most 5' edge of the major domain were below the threshold for positive values on the PCR microarray, although they had relatively high values compared with the intervening regions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). qRT-PCR analysis using primers that amplified fragments contained within these larger PCR microarray fragments gave low but increasingly positive values (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>), suggesting the presence of CENP-A and extending the 5' side of the major domain to include fragments 1, 2, and 3.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>qRT-PCR confirms two separate CenpA domains in the neocentromeric cell line BBB. <bold>(a) </bold>Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was performed on equal amounts of total DNA obtained from centromere protein (CENP)-A chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) DNA and Input DNA from BBB cell line.

However, qRT-PCR of DNA contained within fragment 11 and within fragment 27 were both strongly positive for CENP-A (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>), suggesting that these regions were not completely devoid of CENP-A. On the 3' edge of the major domain, PCR microarray fragment 35 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) was strongly negative for CENP-A. qRT-PCR of two different fragments from within fragment 35 were both negative (below the signal obtained for the alpha satellite DNA control), although they were significantly higher than the qRT-PCR fragments within the intervening regions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>), suggesting a small amount of CENP-A at this region. PCR microarray fragment 38 was negative (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref>), which was confirmed by qRT-PCR (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). PCR microarray fragments 39 and 40 were both weakly positive for CENP-A, defining the 3' edge of the major domain. These data gave a total estimate of 87.8 kb for the major CENP-A domain, encompassing PCR fragments 1 to 40 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a,d</xref>).</p><p>The three PCR microarray fragments 91, 92, and 93 make up the minor domain (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref>), which was confirmed by qRT-PCR (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Fragment 90 was negative for CENP-A on the PCR microarray but weakly positive by qRT-PCR (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). One additional qRT-PCR fragment 3' of 93 was weakly positive, marking the 3' boundary of the minor domain (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) and giving a size estimate of 13.2 kb. These combined PCR microarray and qRT-PCR data suggest that the CENP-A chromatin is not homogeneous across the major and minor domain, but instead may contain distinct subdomains of differing CENP-A nucleosome density (see below).</p></sec><sec><title>CENP-C and CENP-H domains colocalize with the two discontinuous CENP-A chromatin domains</title><p>The low-resolution BAC CHIP analysis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>) suggested a precise co-localization of CENP-C and CENP-H with CENP-A chromatin at the neocentromere in cell line BBB. The extent of this co-localization was further examined relative to the two CENP-A domains revealed by the PCR microarray and qRT-PCR data described above. Hybridization of both CENP-C and CENP-H ChIP DNA to the PCR microarray showed two domains that closely corresponded to the CENP-A domains. The major CENP-C domain had a size of about 87.8 kb, which included the three 5' most PCR fragments 1, 2, and 3 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). The second minor CENP-C domain coincided precisely with the minor CENP-A domain on PCR fragments 91, 92, and 93 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). The major CENP-H domain was about 86.4 kb in size, and included the two 5' PCR fragments 2 and 3 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2c</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). The minor domain was seen to be about 1.9 kb, because only fragments 91 and 92 were significantly positive. Fragments 1 and 93 had relatively high values compared with the intervening regions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2c</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>), suggesting that failure to detect CENP-H in these areas of lower density is most likely due to lack of sensitivity of the CENP-H ChIP. For both CENP-C and CENP-H ChIP, the alpha satellite plasmid showed a highly positive signal intensity ratio. As a negative control, both CENP-C and CENP-H ChIPs derived from cell line CHOP13q (neocentromere in band 13q21 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]) showed no positive hybridization signal in this microarray except for the alpha satellite positive control (data not shown).</p><p>Interestingly, the regions that showed reduced intensity values for the CENP-A domains were largely consistent for both CENP-C and CENP-H, showing definite reduced intensity at both fragments 10 and 11, and at fragments 26 and 27 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b,c</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). On the 3' edge of the major domain, PCR microarray fragment 35 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) was consistently negative for all three CENPs. PCR microarray fragments 36 and 37 were positive for all three CENPs. Fragment 38 was negative for all three CENPs (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> and Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Fragment 39 was positive for CENP-A and CENP-H, and weak for CENP-C. Fragment 40 was the most 3' fragment to be positive for all three CENPs, which defined the 3' edge of the major domain (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).</p><p>Thus, these results suggest tight co-localization of CENP-A, CENP-C, and CENP-H across the major and minor domains, and define a distinct chromatin structure that contains these three centromeric proteins. Overall, for both the major and minor domains, the PCR microarray intensity ratios suggested the highest density of this CENP chromatin in the interior of the domains and reduced density toward the edges (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a,b,c</xref>). The regions within the major domain with reduced intensity for all three proteins may further define several subdomains within the major domain: a 5' domain of about 13 kb (fragments 1 to 9; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) with low CENP chromatin density; two central domains of about 35.3 kb (fragments 12 to 25) and 23.4 kb (fragments 28 to 34) with relatively high density; and two small 3' domains with relatively low density of 1.1 kb (fragments 36 and 37) and 1.7 kb (fragments 39 and 40; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a</xref>). Notably, the regions separating these subdomains were no greater than 5 to 6 kb in size, and the PCR microaray and qRT-PCR results were not consistent with complete absence of CENPs but rather with greatly reduced density in these regions.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>CENP-A nucleosomes are interspersed at variable densities throughout the core centromeric domain. <bold>(a) </bold>The 87.8 kilobase (kb) major domain.

Therefore, we constructed a custom oligo-CHIP that contained a 1.6 kb region on the 5' edge of the domain (fragments 3 and 4; Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) and a 2 kb region from within the domain (fragments 20 and 21). Contiguous 70 mers that fully covered these regions were spotted onto a glass slide and hybridized with CENP-A ChIP DNA that was enhanced for mononucleosome size DNA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). In the first region (left side, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4b</xref>), seven out of 23 oligos (30%) showed a positive intensity ratio, four of which were found in a contiguous stretch, and three of which were noncontiguous. By contrast, in the second region (right side, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4b</xref>) 16 out of 28 oligos (57%) showed a positive intensity ratio, with three distinct regions of contiguous oligos and a single noncontiguous one. These results are consistent with the intensity values obtained with the PCR array, and they support low CENP-A occupancy in the first region and high CENP-A occupancy in the second region. The high resolution of these limited oligo data strongly support the suggestion of differing densities of CENP-A nucleosomes in the neocentromere, with a sparse distribution at the beginning of the major domain and a more dense distribution toward the middle of the domain. This heterogeneity in CENP-A density across the neocentromere is unexpected and has important implications for models of centromeric chromatin structure and formation.</p></sec><sec><title>Sequence Analysis of the CENP-A domains</title><p>The high-resolution analysis presented here permits further sequence analysis of the major and minor domains and the intervening regions. Analysis of the interspersed repetitive DNA elements showed increases in both long interspersed nucleotide element (LINE)1 and mammalian apparent long terminal repeat retrotransposon (MaLR) within the CENP-A major domain (27% LINE1 and 9.0% MaLR elements) and minor domain (29.3% LINE1 and 4.0% MaLR) as compared with the intervening region (11.8% LINE1 and 2.9% MaLR) and genome average (16.9% LINE1 and 3.65% MaLR). A previously analyzed neocentric marker chromosome mardel10 from 10q25 also showed enrichment for LINE1 elements in CENP-A binding regions relative to intervening regions, although it did not show MaLR enrichment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. These two neocentromeres combined with the five other neocentromeres analyzed by BAC ChIP on CHIP provide a large dataset for further analysis of the contribution of DNA sequence, if any, to neocentromere formation.</p><p>Sequence analysis of the density of LINE1 (L1) sequences at these seven neocentromeres was further examined by performing a sliding window analysis of L1 density across 2.5 Mb genomic regions that contain neocentromeres (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> and Additional data file 1). The 10q25 neocentromere occurred in a region of exceptionally high L1 density, with the CENP-A domains largely centered on the peaks of L1 density, but with many of the individual intervening regions also containing comparably high L1 densities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], even if overall the average density was significantly lower (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5a</xref>). The major domain of the BBB neocentromere is also found at a region of L1 density, although it is flanked by regions of higher density, one of which extends into the intervening sequence (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5b</xref>). The neocentromere region in IMS13q also shows the CENP-A domain at a strong local peak of L1 density, although the region that was shown to co-localize with CENP-C and CENP-H falls outside this peak, and there are other regions of comparable L1 density within the 2.5 Mb window analyzed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1c</xref>). The four other neocentromeres that have been localized by CENP-A or CENP-C ChIP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] show varying degrees of L1 density (Additional data file 1). These data taken together suggest a possible role for L1 density in establishing the location of neocentromere formation, especially in regions with large local variation. Whether this is due to some aspect of L1 biology or merely indicates a preference of CENP-A for a DNA motif or profile that occurs more often in L1 sequences remains to be determined.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Sliding window analysis of LINE1 density at neocentromeres.

Although the mardel10 neocentromere was highly enriched for AT sequences, no such correlation was observed for any of the 13q neocentromeres examined. Next, 200 bp windows shifted every 50 bp across a 50 Mb region of chromosome 13, which contains five independent 13q neocentromeres, was examined. Many AT-rich clusters were seen; however, these did not correlate with the neocentromere positions (Additional data file 2 [part B]). At the BBB neocentromere there is a peak of AT-rich DNA, but closer analysis shows this DNA is actually found in the intervening region between the major and minor CENP-A domains. Finally, sequences approximating the <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae </italic>functional centromeric CDEII sequences (four or more runs of A5-7/T5-7 in 90 bp of &#x02265; 90% A or T) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] were located across the 50 Mb region, which did not correlate with the position of neocentromeres (Additional data file 2 [part C]). These analyses do not support a role for AT richness in CENP-A preference for assembly at chromosome 13q neocentromeres.</p><p>In order to examine further the possible role of DNA sequence in neocentromere formation, an analysis of oligomers shared between these seven neocentromere positions was performed. The longest motif that is present in at least one copy in all seven neocentromeres is a 70 mer, which is part of most young L1 elements (positions 5576 to 5645 in the L1PA2 consensus sequence, 51% A+T rich; for sequence, see Materials and methods, below). However, this motif occurs 130 times across chromosome 13 with a median distance of about 42 kb, and does not have a higher density in the neocentromere forming regions than elsewhere on chromosome 13. An analysis of all 9 bp oligomers revealed 22,879 different 9 mers present in at least one copy in the neocentromere sites. None of these was found to be present at significantly higher frequency, at each neocentromere, than expected based on their chromosomal distribution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Thus, this sequence analysis of the seven currently described neocentromere regions does not reveal any striking sequence composition that distinguished them from the remainder of the genome, and thus any power to predict additional neocentromere locations is extremely low. However, because of the relatively low accuracy afforded by BAC arrays, many neocentromere regions included in this analysis are likely to contain regions that flank or intervene between CENP-A domains, which reduced the power of this analysis. Nevertheless, these data further support the idea that DNA sequence plays little or no role in neocentromere determination.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>A better understanding of the structure of the human centromere is important to elucidating its function and the requirements for its formation. Human neocentromeres provide the opportunity to investigate chromatin domain structure in the absence of alpha satellite DNA and relate it directly to the underlying DNA sequence, such that complete detailed maps of entire functional centromeres can be constructed. ChIP coupled with custom-made microarrays at three different resolutions was used in this report to investigate the organization of three inner kinetochore proteins CENP-A, CENP-C, and CENP-H at human neocentromeres. This work represents the highest resolution and most detailed description to date of chromatin domains across a functional human centromere.</p><p>The genomic positions of at least seven independent neocentromeres have been determined by ChIP on BAC microarrays; however, these have relatively limited resolution because of the large size and overlaps of BACs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. At the neocentromere in cell line BBB, CENP-A, CENP-C, and CENP-H ChIP DNA exhibited essentially identical hybridization signals on two contiguous BACs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), which was previously interpreted to indicate a continuous approximately 130 kb chromatin domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. In contrast, at the neocentromere in cell line IMS13q, CENP-A ChIP DNA hybridized to two contiguous BACs, whereas CENP-C and CENP-H ChIP DNA hybridized to only one, which suggested that the CENP-A domain extended about 146 kb beyond an approximately 73 kb domain that contained all three proteins (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). CENP-C ChIP and BAC array analysis of a neocentric 13q21 ring chromosome also indicated a surprisingly small CENP-C domain (54 kb) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], although the CENP-A domain was not determined in this cell line and may extend beyond the CENP-C domain, analogous to IMS13q. However, the lack of complete overlap of CENP-A with CENP-C and CENP-H may reflect less efficient immunoprecipitation of CENP-C and CENP-H associated DNA compared with CENP-A associated DNA. Thus, smaller minor domains of CENP-C and CENP-H may be difficult to detect within the larger CENP-A domains at the sensitivity afforded by BAC arrays. Therefore, in order to further investigate and accurately define the neocentromere chromatin domains in cell line BBB, PCR microarray and qRT-PCR analyses were used. In contrast to the 130 kb continuous CENP-A domain previously defined using BAC arrays, this higher resolution analysis identified two independent CENP-A chromatin domains: a major domain of about 87.8 kb and a minor domain of about 13.2 kb, separated by approximately 158 kb (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).</p><p>Co-immunoprecipitation studies of CENP-A nucleosomes from endogenous centromeres in HeLa cells showed that CENP-C and CENP-H, as well as CENP-B and more than 30 other proteins, were tightly associated with CENP-A chromatin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Therefore, we took advantage of the low-copy DNA at neocentromeres to address further the association of CENP-C and CENP-H with CENP-A directly on the underlying DNA sequence. We found precise co-localization of all three CENPs at both the major and minor domains, which defined a unique inner kinetochore chromatin domain structure. Evidence suggests that CENP-H is dependent on CENP-A for localization, and that it may bridge the interaction between CENP-C and CENP-A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. At endogenous human centromeres, both CENP-A and CENP-C are bound to alpha satellite DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], although clearly at the neocentromere they bind to non-alpha satellite DNA sequences. CENP-B binds to the 17 bp degenerate CENP-B box present in alpha satellite DNA, and may determine CENP-A nucleosome positioning and aid in the formation of alpha satellite derived human artificial chromosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. However, centromeric chromatin at neocentromeres has assembled on regions devoid of alpha satellite DNA and CENP-B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], and thus it is independent of any CENP-B assembly effect.</p><p>An in-depth sequence analysis remains consistent with a possible role for L1 sequences in neocentromere formation, especially because the only 'conserved' element that could be found in common across the complete set of seven neocentromeres for which CENP ChIP has been performed is a 70 bp motif that is part of relatively young L1 elements. This element is even found in neocentromeres with no clear enrichment of L1 sequences (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> and Additional data file 1). Additional high-resolution mapping of discontinuous CENP-A domains across other neocentromeres may reduce the background of intervening regions that do not bind CENP-A and further increase the predictive power of such sequence analysis.</p><p>The PCR microarray and qRT-PCR data presented here may reflect differences in the density of chromatin that contains CENP-A, CENP-C, and CENP-H across the major and minor domains, suggesting lower density near the edges of the domains and increasing density toward the center (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Direct analysis of two regions using an oligomer array confirmed differences in CENP-A density near the edge and middle of the major domain (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Small regions of reduced intensity ratios for CENP-A, CENP-C, and CENP-H were observed across the major domain (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), suggesting possible further organization into subdomains ranging in size from about 1 kb up to approximately 35 kb (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a</xref>), separated by domains no larger than 4 to 5 kb with greatly reduced density of CENP-A, CENP-C, and CENP-H chromatin. The other nucleosomes in these regions presumably contain histone H3 instead of CENP-A, although this could not be assayed directly in these cells because of the background from three additional homologous chromosomal regions that were not forming a neocentromere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Although we do not formally know the absolute amount of CENP-A nucleosomes in these regions and the extent to which they are interspersed with H3 nucleosomes, the PCR microarray clearly shows differences in CENP-A, CENP-C, and CENP-H density across the domain. It would be interesting to determine whether the different CENP-A density reflects populations of cells in different stages of the cell cycle in the unsynchronized cells examined, where CENP-A density would be highest in the region after mitosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>].</p><p>It is of interest to compare these results with the previous description of the organization of chromatin domains on the mardel10 neocentromere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). One of the most important differences is that the CENP-H domain on the mardel10 was mapped (using BAC microarrays) to an approximately 900 kb domain, which was about 1 Mb from the 330 kb CENP-A domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], in distinct contrast to the co-localization we observed between CENP-A and CENP-H at two chromosome 13 neocentromeres (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). PCR fragment mapping of the CENP-A domains on the mardel10 neocentromere, performed at somewhat lower resolution relative to this study, showed a central large CENP-A domain of 51.8 kb flanked on both sides by three symmetrically distributed smaller domains of 10.5 kb to 29.8 kb, separated by domains of 20.5 kb to 49.5 kb of H3 containing domains (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5a</xref>). Our neocentromere showed in contrast one large major CENP-A domain and a smaller minor domain (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5b</xref>). Our PCR microarray did suggest putative subdomains of CENP-A across the major domain that were more consistent with the mardel 10 domains, but with much smaller intervening regions of under 5 kb that did not appear to be completely devoid of CENP-A.</p><p>Discontinuous domains of CENP-A chromatin have now been described at human and <italic>Drosophila </italic>centromeres [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], rice centromeres (<italic>Oryza sativa</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>], and now at two human neocentromeres [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] (the present report also). The CENP-A chromatin at the BBB neocentromere falls within intergenic regions, where the major and minor CENP-A domains did not contain any genes, while the intervening region between the CENP-A domains, as well as the flanking regions, were relatively gene rich (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Rice centromeres (Cen3 and Cen8) have formed on approximately Mb sized regions that have a low content of centromeric repeated DNA (CentO) and active genes. However, rice centromere chromatin appears to be largely intergenic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. These data may suggest an avoidance of active chromatin by CENP-A nucleosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. In contrast, the mardel10 neocentromere CENP-A domain has formed directly on the <italic>ATRNL1 </italic>gene, although notably avoiding the promoter region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>].</p><p>Discontinuous domains of CENP-A chromatin are consistent with a higher order chromatin looping model, in which domains of CENP-A chromatin are brought together to form a surface for kinetochore assembly, with intervening non-CENP-A chromatin facing inward toward the sister chromatid cohesion domains of the centromere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. The domain organization observed at the BBB neocentromere may suggest a single chromatin loop closed off by the major and minor CENP-A domains, although the putative subdomains of differing CENP-A density may suggest additional chromatin loops. These data taken together suggest that functional neocentromeres may form on varied patterns of inner kinetochore chromatin, and so what they have in common with each other and with endogenous centromeres may reveal considerable insight into the requirements for centromere formation and function. Further application of the technology presented here may eventually permit construction of a complete structural map of a functional neocentromere as it relates to the underlying DNA sequence, complete with the positions of heterochromatin and sister chromatid cohesion domains.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Antibodies</title><p>Mouse monoclonal anti-CENP-A and rabbit polyclonal anti-CENP-H were previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].

Linear intensity ratios were then transformed to log<sub>2 </sub>ratios, scale normalized (X-log<sub>2 </sub>mean of experiment/SD of the experiment) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. For each experiment at least three independent biologic replicates were performed and averaged. For the BAC CHIPs, for which less than 1% of the values were positives, we calculated the experimental mean and SD using all values. Positive intensity ratios were identified as those that were three or more times the SD from the experimental mean. For the PCR CHIPs, for which the number of positives was about 15%, a one-tailed distribution was used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] to calculate the experimental mean. The total range of intensity ratio values was divided into 16 bins (which is the square root of the number of observations [257]), resulting in two distinct distributions containing a large number of low values and relatively small number of higher values. The mean of the experiment was calculated using the lower values from the larger distribution. Experimental positives were taken as values whose mean log<sub>2 </sub>intensity ratio was greater than or equal to the experimental mean plus three times its SD.</p></sec><sec><title>Quantitative real-time PCR</title><p>Each primers set was tested on a serial DNA dilution to produce a standard curve, and similar slopes were obtained for all of them.

We found all 9 mers present in the seven neocentromere binding sites, as well as on chromosomes 13 and 10, and determined their frequencies in both the neocentromeres and the entire chromosome. Complementary 9 mers were counted as the same oligomer. For these analyses, we have combined the discontinuous CENP-A domains from the neocentromeres from cell line BBB and the mardel10 chromosome into one sequence. We extracted the list of oligomers that are present in at least one copy in all seven neocentromere binding sites ('shared' 9 mers). Finally, using six neocentromere binding sites (BBB, IMS13q, 98RO16, CHOP13q, RingA, and mardel10) we tested whether any of these shared 9 mers are over-represented compared with the chromosomal average. Because the RingA site reports only the location of CENP-C, and the actual binding site of CENP-A is likely to be larger, we included 50 kb upstream and downstream of the site in the analysis. Additionally, we excluded the neo20 neocentromere from the analysis, because it is mapped considerably less accurately than the others (and it is likely to include a large amount of sequence that is not part of the true Cenp-A binding site). To test whether a 9 mer is significantly more abundant in a neocentromere than expected based on its abundance on the entire chromosome, we used the test described by Trindade and coworkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], with significance level set to <italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.05.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Additional data files</title><p>The following additional data are available with the online version of this paper.
