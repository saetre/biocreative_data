Interaction between IREs and IRE-BP induces repression of ferritin mRNA translation and transferrin receptor mRNA stabilization. We describe the identification of extensive amino acid sequence homology between IRE-BP and two known isomerases, aconitase and isopropylmalate (IPM) isomerase. We discuss the implications of this observation with regard to structure/function relationships of IRE-BP. The structural conservation between a regulatory RNA-binding protein and two enzymes involved in intermediary metabolism provides a surprising example of the functional flexibility in biological structures.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00088-0011.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1739"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00088-0012.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1740"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
