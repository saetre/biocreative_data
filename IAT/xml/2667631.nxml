However, after 24 hours in hypertonic medium, wild-type and NFAT5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells displayed distinct differences. Whereas wild-type lymphocytes maintained the expression of cyclins E1, A2 and B1, NFAT5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells had substantially reduced levels of these cyclins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005245-g004">Fig. 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0005245.s005">Fig. S5</xref>), though they were able to express cyclin D3. We analyzed whether downregulation of cyclins was associated with a decrease in their mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005245-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). The amount of mRNA for cyclins A2 and B1 was substantially decreased (by 60&#x02013;70&#x00025;) in both wild-type and NFAT5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> lymphocytes after 8 hours of hypertonicity treatment. By 24 hours, wild-type lymphocytes had recovered similar cyclin mRNA levels as those of cells grown in isotonic medium, whereas NFAT5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells did not. With regard to cyclin E1, its protein levels were much more reduced than its mRNA abundance in NFAT5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells, suggesting that its downregulation might involve defective protein synthesis and/or enhanced degradation. We next analyzed whether the lack of NFAT5 affected the activity of cyclin A2 and B1 promoters. Jurkat T cells were transfected with NFAT5-specific shRNAs and reporter constructs driven by cyclin promoters, and then cultured in isotonic or hypertonic conditions during 8 or 24 hours. Since the activity of at least the cyclin A2 promoter is regulated by NFAT1/NFATc2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005245-Carvalho1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, we first confirmed that the NFAT5 shRNAs inhibited only this factor, and not NFATc proteins. We tested both shRNAs with the same reporter, 9&#x000d7;NFAT-Luc, which can be activated independently by NFAT5 in response to hypertonic stress, or by the calcineurin-dependent NFATc proteins in response to PMA and ionomycin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005245-Morancho1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005245-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>).

Although one of the shRNAs (shN5-1) slightly increased the activity of the cyclin A2 promoter after 24 hours in isotonic conditions, this effect was likely non-specific, since it was not observed with another shRNA (shN5-3) that was comparably effective in inhibiting NFAT5. On the other hand, overexpression of NFAT5 enhanced the activity of the control 9&#x000d7;NFAT-Luc reporter during both short (8 hours) and longer (24 hours) hypertonicity treatments, and did not affect the cyclin B1 promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005245-g004">Fig. 4D</xref>). We observed that overexpressed NFAT5 caused a transient increase in the activity of the cyclin A2 promoter at 8 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005245-g004">Fig. 4D</xref>). However, since this effect was moderate, occurred in both isotonic and hypertonic conditions, and we had not observed a decrease in cyclin A2 promoter activity upon suppessing NFAT5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005245-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>), it is unclear whether it reflected a meaningful function of NFAT5.

Our results show that this response developed in two phases. The early phase was NFAT5-independent and characterized by a sharp induction of p53 and other genotoxic stress markers (p21, GADD45&#x003b1; and &#x003b2;), downregulation of cyclins mRNA, and acute cell cycle arrest in S and G2/M. This initial response changed to an NFAT5-regulated adaptive phase in wild-type cells, which induced osmoprotective gene products such as Hsp70.1, SMIT, SNAT2 and TauT, resumed cyclin expression, and reactivated the cell cycle. In contrast, NFAT5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells showed poor induction of osmoprotective genes, manifested an extended early stress phase with prolonged accumulation of p53, and exhibited a greater viability loss than wild-type cells by 24 hours. Surviving NFAT5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells had downregulated stress markers but displayed a reduced DNA replication rate and defective cell cycle progression associated with the inability to maintain the expression of cyclins that regulate G1 to G2/M progression.

Another difference between these mouse models is that T cells in our conditional knockout mice were NFAT5-null, whereas thymocytes and T cells in the two previous models coexpressed functional NFAT5 molecules together with truncated dominant negative products, which might have additional effects on T cell development. On the other hand, a recent article described that mice with reduced expression of the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Brx had substantially decreased NFAT5 expression in spleen and renal medulla <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005245-Kino1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>, exhibited B cell defects and reduced splenocyte counts, but had normal T cell proportions. These findings suggest that different NFAT5-deficient mouse models could exhibit variable degrees of immune dysfunction depending on whether NFAT5 is impaired only in mature T cells or in other cell types.</p><p>Our results indicate that lack of NFAT5 in cells exposed to hypertonicity could lead to different outcomes, with a proportion of the cells dying, probably as result of an enhanced genotoxic stress response, whereas surviving cells did not exhibit conspicuous symptoms of DNA damage but had a substantially reduced expression of cyclins and aurora B kinase. Previous work had shown that inhibition of NFAT5 could cause symptoms of DNA damage in non-proliferating cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005245-Wang1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, but until now it was not known that the abundance of specific cell cycle regulators was sensitive to hypertonicity and the lack of NFAT5. Defective expression of cyclins and aurora B kinase might underlie the cell cycle defects of NFAT5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells under hypertonic stress, since cyclins A2 and B1 are needed for S and G2/M progression in different cell types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005245-Yuan1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005245-DeBoer1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>, and aurora B kinase is a positive regulator of cell cycle progression through G1/S to M in T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005245-Song1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. Here it is important to notice that lack of NFAT5 did not shut down all processes, and for instance NFAT5-deficient cells were able to reinduce cyclin D3 after its initial downregulation by hypertonic stress. Our results also indicate that expression of these cell cycle regulators was affected at different levels in NFAT5-deficient cells, as loss of cyclins A2, B1 and aurora B kinase correlated with a reduction in their mRNA abundance, whereas the decrease in cyclin E1 did not appear to be solely attributable to mRNA deficiency, and might be due to reduced protein stability and/or synthesis rate. On the other hand, suppression or overexpression of NFAT5 did not substantially affect the activity of cyclins A2 and B1 promoters under hypertonic stress. Although these results do not rule out that NFAT5 might have an effect on other regulatory regions of cyclin genes, they suggest that it does not control the activity of their promoters. In this regard, NFAT5 differs from the NFATc protein NFAT1/c2, which can repress the expression of cyclins E, A2 and B1 during T cell activation by antigen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005245-Caetano1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>. At least for cyclin A2, this repression was mediated by inhibition of the activity of its promoter by NFAT1/c2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005245-Carvalho1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. In view of these observations, we propose that lack of NFAT5 might indirectly perturb the expression of cyclins and possibly other genes in cells exposed to osmotic stress as result of the combined deficiency in osmoprotective gene products, which are needed for the adaptation to hypertonic conditions and are the primary targets of NFAT5. This interpretation is consistent with the finding that cells lacking the chaperones Hsp70 and Hspa4l/Osp94, whose induction by hypertonicity is NFAT5-dependent, have defects similar to those of NFAT5<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells: Hsp70-deficient fibroblasts and renal medullary cells have reduced viability under hypertonic conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005245-Shim1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>, and Hspa4l/Osp94-deficient mice exhibited loss of renal medullary cells similarly to NFAT5-deficient mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005245-LopezRodriguez2">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005245-Held1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Here we have used primary lymphocytes as a cell model to study the response of proliferating NFAT5-deficient cells to pathologic hypertonic stress conditions. We have shown that moderate osmotic stress induced an NFAT5-dependent osmoprotective gene expression program in T cells, and that lack of this factor led to defects in the expression of several cyclins and aurora B kinase. The feasibility of generating mice lacking NFAT5 in specific cell lineages will be useful to determine the sensitivity of other types of primary cells to pathophysiologic alterations of tonicity, and to elucidate the role of this factor in different cellular functions and processes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Generation of NFAT5 conditional mice</title><p>A targeting vector was designed to flank exon 6 of the mouse <italic>NFAT5</italic> gene with two <italic>loxP</italic> sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0005245.s001">Fig. S1</xref>).
