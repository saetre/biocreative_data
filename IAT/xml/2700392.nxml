By regulating their synthesis, we showed that the loss of these nucleoporins triggers a decrease in NPCs caused by a halt in new NPC assembly. Preexisting NPCs are ultimately lost by dilution as cells grow, causing the inhibition of nuclear transport and the loss of viability. Significantly, the loss of Nup170p/Nup157p had distinct effects on the assembly of different architectural components of the NPC. Nucleoporins (nups) positioned on the cytoplasmic face of the NPC rapidly accumulated in cytoplasmic foci. These nup complexes could be recruited into new NPCs after reinitiation of Nup170p synthesis, and may represent a physiological intermediate. Loss of Nup170p/Nup157p also caused core and nucleoplasmically positioned nups to accumulate in NPC-like structures adjacent to the inner nuclear membrane, which suggests that these nucleoporins are required for formation of the pore membrane and the incorporation of cytoplasmic nups into forming NPCs.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Molecules travel across the nuclear envelope (NE) through nuclear pore complexes (NPCs). The NPC (&#x0223c;66 MD in yeast) possesses eightfold rotational symmetry perpendicular to the plane of the NE and can be divided in three parts: a central core or annulus, the nuclear basket, and cytoplasmic filaments. Structural analyses have revealed that the central core consists of distinct cytoplasmic, luminal spokes, and nucleoplasmic rings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yang et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beck et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beck et al., 2007</xref>). Movement of macromolecules through the NPC is controlled by nuclear transport receptors, which bind to nuclear localization signals (NLSs) or nuclear export signals on these molecules. Karyopherins (kaps) are a family of structurally related proteins, of which there are 14 in yeast, that bind to different signals and function as importers (importins) or exporters (exportins; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wozniak et al., 1998</xref>). Kaps interact with a subset of NPC proteins (termed nucleoporins [nups]) containing phenylalanine-glycine repeats (termed FG-nups) that populate the translocation channel. Distinct models suggest that the FG-nups form a hydrophobic barrier (hydrogel; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Frey et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Frey and Gorlich, 2007</xref>) or, by the rapid Brownian motion of unstructured FG domains, a virtual gate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rout et al., 2003</xref>). By binding FG-nups, kaps overcome this barrier and progress through the channel.</p><p>The FG-nups are attached to the symmetrical core that forms the architectural framework of the NPC. The core is composed largely of nups that lack FG repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hetzer et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tran and Wente, 2006</xref>). Several of these are transmembrane proteins (termed poms), which probably function by anchoring the NPC to the NE. The structural organization of nups that contribute to the rings and spokes of the NPC has been investigated using various biochemical, genetic, and cytological techniques (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Suntharalingam and Wente, 2003</xref>). Seminal contributions have included the isolation and characterization of subcomplexes. In yeast, these include the heptameric Nup84p subcomplex, the Nup188p&#x02013;Nic96p&#x02013;Pom152p subcomplex, and the Nup170p&#x02013;Nup53p&#x02013;Nup59p subcomplex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nehrbass et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Marelli et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lutzmann et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lutzmann et al., 2005</xref>). Recently, through an elegant biochemical and computational study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alber et al. (2007a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">b</xref>) proposed a structure of the NPC that provides a view of how nups are likely organized within the NPC. A growing body of crystal structures of nups, among them the structure of a Sec13&#x02013;Nup145 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hsia et al., 2007</xref>), have also led to predictions for the structure of the NPC. These varied approaches are likely to provide a high-resolution map of the NPC core in the near future.</p><p>The assembly of subcomplexes likely plays a role in the formation of mature NPCs. This process occurs both when the NE is intact and during NE reassembly in the final stages of mitosis. Postmitotic NPC assembly occurs in organisms that undergo an open mitosis, and at the end of mitosis, when membrane vesicles and NPC components are recruited back to the chromatin surface. Studies using in vitro <italic>Xenopus</italic> NE assembly assays and tissue culture cells show that NPC formation occurs through the ordered assembly of nup subcomplexes on the chromatin surface together with coordinated interactions with the NE membrane (for reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hetzer et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tran and Wente, 2006</xref>). First, the Nup107&#x02013;160 subcomplex (vertebrate equivalent of the yeast Nup84p subcomplex) is recruited to chromatin through its interactions with ELYS/Mel28 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rasala et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Franz et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gillespie et al., 2007</xref>). These prepores act as binding sites for membrane vesicles containing Ndc1 and Pom121 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Antonin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rasala et al., 2008</xref>). This step is functionally linked to the incorporation of Nup155 and Nup53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Franz et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hawryluk-Gara et al., 2008</xref>) and precedes a cascade of events that ultimately leads to the formation of mature NPCs.</p><p>NPCs are also formed across an intact NE. In higher eukaryotic cells, the number of NPCs appears to double during S phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Maul et al., 1972</xref>). Accordingly, NPC assembly has been observed across an intact NE of nuclei reconstituted in vitro using <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts and in vivo using HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">D'Angelo et al., 2006</xref>). The assembly of NPCs across the NE is likely the only mechanism functioning in unicellular eukaryotes that undergo closed mitoses (i.e., the NE remains intact during mitosis). In <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, the number of NPCs increases throughout the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Winey et al., 1997</xref>), allowing NPC numbers to be maintained in both the mother and daughter. A recent study suggests that the process may be more complicated, with new NPC formation being the primary source of NPCs in the daughter nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shcheprova et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>A requisite step in the formation of NPCs across the NE is the fusion of the inner and outer nuclear membranes to form transcisternal nuclear pores. Poms and nups located close to the membrane are likely to play a role in this and accompanying steps of NPC assembly. In higher eukaryotes, three poms&#x02014;gp210, Pom121, and Ndc1&#x02014;have each been implicated in NPC assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Antonin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mansfeld et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Stavru et al., 2006a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Funakoshi et al., 2007</xref>). Three <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> poms&#x02014;Pom152p, Pom34p, and Ndc1p&#x02014;also appear to share a redundant function in NPC assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chial et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lau et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Madrid et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Miao et al., 2006</xref>). In addition to poms, analyses of several yeast nups have lead to the conclusion that they are required for NPC assembly. Mutants in <italic>NIC96</italic>, <italic>NUP192</italic>, or <italic>NSP1</italic> cause a decrease in NPC numbers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mutvei et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zabel et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kosova et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gomez-Ospina et al., 2000</xref>). Studies using <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts have also implicated nuclear and cytoplasmic pools of the Nup107&#x02013;160 subcomplex in forming NPCs within intact nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">D'Angelo et al., 2006</xref>). Intriguingly, NPC assembly also employs soluble components of the nuclear transport machinery including Ran, Kap121p, and Kap95p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lusk et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ryan et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">D'Angelo et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>The <italic>NUP170</italic> gene family is conserved among eukaryotes and is essential for growth in various species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gigliotti et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kiger et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Galy et al., 2003</xref>). The <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> genome encodes two homologous genes&#x02014;<italic>NUP170</italic> and <italic>NUP157</italic>&#x02014;one or the other of which is required for growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aitchison et al., 1995</xref>). Both genetic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aitchison et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tcheperegine et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Miao et al., 2006</xref>) and structural studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alber et al., 2007a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">b</xref>) suggest that Nup170p and Nup157p are located close to the pore membrane, where they could interact with poms and the membrane. Nup170p and Nup157p are predicted to contain &#x003b2;-propeller and &#x003b1;-solenoid domains that are reminiscent of membrane coat proteins such as clathrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Devos et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">2006</xref>). To uncover their functions, we constructed a conditional lethal strain that allowed repression of <italic>NUP170</italic> in the absence of <italic>NUP157</italic>. We found that loss of these proteins caused a decrease in NPC density due to a defect in new NPC assembly. In the absence of Nup170p and Nup157p, newly synthesized nups accumulated in cytoplasmic foci and inner nuclear membrane-associated structures, which is suggestive of stalled NPC assembly intermediates. Importantly, reinitiation of Nup170p synthesis induces the dissociation of the cytoplasmic foci and their incorporation into the NE. We conclude that Nup170p and Nup157p are required for the assembly of subcomplexes within the forming NPC at a step that likely coincides with the fusion of the outer and inner nuclear membranes and the formation of the nuclear pore.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Loss of Nup170p and Nup157p causes a decrease in the number of the NPCs</title><p>One of the major lineages that comprise the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> complex shares a common ancestor that underwent a whole genome duplication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Scannell et al., 2007</xref>). The duplicated <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> genome retains &#x0223c;551 duplicate pairs, including the nup genes <italic>NUP170</italic> and <italic>NUP157</italic>.

Neither gene is essential for growth, but deletion of the pair is lethal, which suggests that they share essential functions.</p><p>To investigate the molecular basis underlying the synthetic lethality of <italic>nup170</italic> and <italic>nup157</italic> null alleles, the endogenous <italic>NUP170</italic> promoter was replaced by a repressible <italic>MET3</italic> promoter in backgrounds containing or lacking <italic>NUP157</italic> (<italic>P<sub>MET3</sub>-NUP170 NUP157</italic> and <italic>P<sub>MET3</sub>-NUP170 nup157&#x00394;</italic>). In the absence of methionine, the <italic>MET3</italic> promoter is active, leading to levels of Nup170p that are similar to those of wild-type (WT) cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>). Upon addition of methionine, the promoter is repressed and levels of Nup170p decrease. By 4 h after methionine addition, Nup170p levels are barely detectable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>). In strains containing Nup157p (<italic>P<sub>MET3</sub>-NUP170 NUP157</italic>), depletion of Nup170p had little effect on growth. However, strains lacking Nup157p and depleted of Nup170p (which we will refer to as depleted of Nup170p [<italic>nup157&#x00394;</italic>]) failed to form colonies on plates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Depletion of Nup170p in the <italic>nup157&#x00394;</italic> background causes a defect in cell growth.</bold> (A) The strains TMY1098 (<italic>P<sub>MET3</sub>-HA-NUP170</italic>) and TMY1269 (<italic>NUP170-HA</italic>) were grown in medium lacking methionine.

Samples were harvested at various time points after the addition of methionine, postfixed with potassium permanganate, and analyzed by thin-section transmission EM (TEM). With this method, membranes are darkly stained while proteinaceous structures are not highlighted. Thus, the NE membrane is clearly visible and nuclear pores appear as gaps of defined size in the continuity of the NE. WT or cells depleted of only Nup170p (<italic>P<sub>MET3</sub>-NUP170 NUP157</italic>) contained largely spherical nuclei with visible nuclear pores (unpublished data). Similarly, <italic>P<sub>MET3</sub>-NUP170 nup157&#x00394;</italic> cells showed no striking changes in the shape or size of their nuclei through 8 h after the addition of methionine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>). However, these nuclei contained fewer pores. We quantified the number of NPCs by counting the number of pores per micrometer of linear distance along the NE in multiple sections. A linear density of 0.54 &#x000b1; 0.03 pores/&#x000b5;m was determined for the <italic>P<sub>MET3</sub>-NUP170 nup157&#x00394;</italic> strain at 0 h, which was similar to that of the <italic>P<sub>MET3</sub>-NUP170 NUP157</italic> strain (0.52 &#x000b1; 0.05 pores/&#x000b5;m). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>, by 4 and 8 h after repressing <italic>NUP170</italic> (<italic>nup157&#x00394;</italic>), we detected a progressive decrease in NPC density to 0.24 &#x000b1; 0.01 pores/&#x000b5;m and 0.15 &#x000b1; 0.03 pores/&#x000b5;m, respectively. By later time points (16 h), gross morphological changes were observed in the nuclei, including the formation of NE projections and invaginations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>).

To investigate the effects of depletion on nuclear transport, we examined the localization of reporter proteins imported by Kap121p (Pho4-NLS-GFP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kaffman et al., 1998</xref>), Kap123p (rpL25-NLS-GFP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Timney et al., 2006</xref>), Kap104p (Nab2-NLS-GFP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lee and Aitchison, 1999</xref>), and the Kap60p/Kap95p heterodimer (cNLS-GFP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Shulga et al., 1996</xref>). All continued to accumulate within nuclei 6 h after methionine addition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>). Nuclear import rates are generally much faster than needed to achieve good steady-state nuclear localization. Therefore, we used an assay described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Shulga et al.

Interestingly, the relative rates of import decreased by &#x0223c;50% and &#x0223c;75% after 4 and 8 h of depletion, which mirrors the decrease in NPCs observed at these time points. In contrast, depletion of Nup170p alone did not significantly alter the import rate of the Nab2-NLS-GFP reporter, although some lag was seen at early time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref>).

To more closely evaluate the role of these nups in NPC assembly, we examined the consequences of depleting Nup170p and Nup157p on the association of individual nups with the NE. To visualize each nup, a <italic>GFP</italic> tag was introduced at the 3&#x02032; end of its open reading frame (ORF). In most cases, the <italic>NUP-GFP</italic> allele did not affect cell growth.

As a consequence, these nups were omitted from further analysis.</p><p>The localization of each nup-GFP fusion was examined 6 h after methionine-induced repression of <italic>NUP170</italic>. Nups belonging to various subdomains of the NPC were examined, including those positioned on the cytoplasmic or nucleoplasmic face (here referred to as cytoplasmic or nucleoplasmic nups), and within the core, integral membrane proteins. The most dramatic effects of Nup170p (<italic>nup157&#x00394;</italic>) depletion were on nups positioned exclusively on the cytoplasmic face of the NPC, including Nup82-GFP and Nup159-GFP. Upon depletion of Nup170p (<italic>nup157&#x00394;</italic>; 6 h), the NE localization of Nup82-GFP and Nup159-GFP was largely lost, and the proteins were found in foci located in the cytoplasm and occasionally adjacent the NE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>). Generally, 3&#x02013;7 foci were visible per cell. In contrast, the nucleoplasmic nups Nup1-GFP, Nup2-GFP, Nup60-GFP, and Mlp1-GFP, and the membrane protein Pom152p retained their nuclear rim localization over the same time period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>). Finally, nups that contribute to the central core of the NPC showed a mixed phenotype upon depletion of Nup170p (<italic>nup157&#x00394;</italic>). For example, components of the Nup84p complex (Nup84-GFP, Nup85-GFP, and Nup133-GFP), Gle1-GFP, Nup100-GFP, and Ndc1-GFP were still visible at the NE but generally exhibited a weaker signal than seen at the time of 0 h. In addition, these nups were also detected in punctate cytoplasmic structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>). Cytoplasmic foci were also visible, but less abundant, when we examined a group of more centrally located core nups and poms including Nup188-GFP, Nup59-GFP, Nup53-GFP, and Pom34-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>).

All of the double-tagged strains grew normally when either Nup157p or Nup170p was present, which suggests that the tags did not alter the functions of these nups. 4 h after addition of methionine, both Nup159-mRFP and Nup82-GFP colocalized to the same cytoplasmic foci adjacent the NE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>).

We demonstrate that the cytoplasmic foci represent pools of nups that remain competent to assemble into NPCs after reinitiation of <italic>NUP170</italic> expression.</p><p>Other nup mutants also show a decrease in NPC numbers, including <italic>nic96-1</italic> and <italic>nup192-15</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zabel et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kosova et al., 1999</xref>). In these mutants, the overall NE structure, protein import, and mRNA export are not significantly altered at early times after transfer into a nonpermissive condition; however, the number of the NPCs is significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zabel et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kosova et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gomez-Ospina et al., 2000</xref>). Thus, much like cells lacking Nup170p and Nup157p, these mutations are likely to affect NPC assembly but not the function of intact NPCs. This difference is not always discernible, and, in the case of several other nup mutants, it has been difficult to discriminate between those mutations that affect the integrity or function of the NPC versus those inhibiting assembly. Among the most interesting phenotypes observed are those of nup mutants that induce NE herniations that seal over NPCs (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wente and Blobel, 1993</xref>). It is not clear, however, whether this phenotype arises as a consequence of assembly defects or represents a cellular response to damaged NPCs.</p><p>Of the various nup mutants that have now been examined, only cells lacking both Nup170p and Nup157p exhibit the unique feature of accumulating putative NPC assembly intermediates. These intermediates were revealed by the inspection of individual nups after loss of Nup170p and Nup157p. Nups that contribute to defined NPC subcomplexes or are positioned at a common location in the NPC (e.g., the nucleoplasmic face of the NPC) exhibited one of three distinct localization patterns. For example, the cytoplasmic nups Nup82p and its binding partner Nup159p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Belgareh et al., 1998</xref>) rapidly accumulated in cytoplasmic foci after loss of Nup170p and Nup157p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>). In a second phenotype, nups associated with the symmetrical core of the NPC showed a mixed distribution between the cytoplasmic foci and structures along the NE. Several nups thought to be closely associated with Nup82p in the NPC, including Gle1p, Nup100p, and members of the Nup84p complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alber et al., 2007a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">b</xref>), showed a clear association with the cytoplasmic foci as well as the NE. Other core nups including Nup188p and Nup53p exhibited a weaker, but detectable, signal in cytoplasm foci. Similarly, Ndc1p and Pom34p were seen in a subset of the cytoplasm foci, presumably those at or near the NE or ER membrane. Each of these core nups and poms also exhibited a significant punctate NE localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>). In contrast, nucleoplasmic nups were found exclusively at the NE after the loss of Nup170p and Nup157p (6 h; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>). These results, coupled with the results of the Nup60-Dendra and the immunoelectron microscopy experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref>), have lead us to conclude that association of the core and nucleoplasmic nups with the NE reflected their presences in the inner membrane&#x02013;associated, NPC-like structures.</p><p>The nup localization patterns seen after the loss of Nup170p and Nup157p provide important insights into their role in NPC assembly. We conclude that the removal of Nup170p and Nup157p does not inhibit the targeting of core and nucleoplasmic nups to the nuclear periphery or their assembly into structural precursors of the NPC, which are what we interpret the inner nuclear membrane&#x02013;associated structures to represent. In contrast, Nup170p and Nup157p appear essential for the incorporation of the cytoplasmically positioned nups into NPCs. Although displaced from the NE, these nups appear to associate with known binding partners (e.g., the interaction of the Nup82p/Nup159p with the Nup84p complex) within cytoplasmic foci. These foci are likely composed of assembly intermediates, not nonspecific aggregates, as their nups remain competent to target to the NE after derepression of <italic>NUP170</italic>, and appear to assemble into NPCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 C</xref>).</p><p>We propose that Nup170p and Nup157p function at the NE membrane, where they facilitate insertion of the core and cytoplasmic structures into the forming nuclear pore, potentially by assisting in the fusion of the inner and outer nuclear membranes. Alternatively, these factors could be required for the bending and stabilization of the incipient nuclear pore, which may form but collapse in their absence. These activities would necessitate the positioning of these proteins at or near the membrane. A growing number of observations support these ideas; among these are synthetic lethal interactions between mutations in <italic>NUP170</italic> and <italic>POM152</italic> or <italic>POM34</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aitchison et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tcheperegine et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Miao et al., 2006</xref>). These interactions appear to be based, in part, on physical associations. Nup170p binds directly to the pore-exposed region of Pom152p (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200810029/DC1">Fig. S1</ext-link>) and is detected in subcomplexes with Ndc1p, Pom34p, and Pom152p; Nup157p is detected bound to Pom34p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alber et al., 2007b</xref>; see Onischenko et al. on p. <related-article xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" related-article-type="article-reference" vol="185" page="475" id="d31e1278" xlink:href="19414609" ext-link-type="pubmed">475</related-article> of this issue). Also, based on their analysis, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alber et al. (2007a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">b</xref>) have positioned Nup170p and Nup157p adjacent to the membrane in their proposed architecture of the NPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alber et al., 2007a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">b</xref>).</p><p>The placement of Nup170p at or near the pore is also consistent with functions suggested by its structural features. Like members of the Nup84p complex, Nup170p and Nup157p are predicted to contain an N-terminal &#x003b2;-propeller and a C-terminal &#x003b1;-solenoid domain, features they also share with membrane vesicle coatomer proteins such as clathrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Devos et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">2006</xref>). By analogy to clathrin, these regions of Nup170p and Nup157p provide surfaces for interactions with membrane proteins and perhaps a means for these proteins to influence the curvature of the pore membrane. In support of this idea, near the N-terminal end of the &#x003b1;-solenoid region of Nup170p lies a predicted membrane-binding, amphipathic &#x003b1;-helix, or ALPS, domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Drin et al., 2007</xref>). An ALPS domain has also been detected in Nup133p, and its ability to preferentially bind curved membranes has been documented in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Drin et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>In addition to their own membrane binding potential, Nup170p and Nup157p also directly interact with Nup53p (Fig. S1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lusk et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alber et al., 2007a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib134">Onischenko et al., 2009</xref>; unpublished data). Nup53p contains a C-terminal amphipathic helix that mediates membrane binding and is required for the formation of inner membrane&#x02013;derived tubular vesicular structures induced by the overexpression of Nup53p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Marelli et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Patel and Rexach, 2008</xref>). We envisage that the complexes formed between Nup53p&#x02013;Nup170p&#x02013;Nup157p are likely capable of interacting with the membrane at multiple interfaces and by various mechanisms, which are properties consistent with a role for these proteins in steps that promote membrane curvature and fusion during NPC assembly.</p><p>It remains to be determined whether the mammalian counterpart of Nup170p and Nup157p, Nup155, would play a similar role in interphase NPC assembly. However, Nup155 is essential for postmitotic NPC assembly, and its function has been linked to events at the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Franz et al., 2005</xref>). Depletion of Nup155 from <italic>Xenopus</italic> extracts inhibits NPC and NE assembly at a step after vesicle binding to chromatin. This phenotype is similar to that observed upon depletion of the membrane proteins POM121 or NDC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Antonin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mansfeld et al., 2006</xref>) and the Nup155 binding partner Nup53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hawryluk-Gara et al., 2008</xref>), but is distinct from phenotypes seen after depletion of other nups, including members of the Nup107&#x02013;Nup160 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Harel et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Walther et al., 2003</xref>). These results have been interpreted to suggest that the functions of Nup155 and Nup53 in NPC assembly are tightly linked to those of POM121 or NDC1, which is consistent with a potential role for these proteins in influencing pore membrane structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hawryluk-Gara et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>The steps that lead to pore formation in yeast, including changes in membrane structure and fusion, are also likely to be controlled by additional factors, including non-NPC proteins and lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schneiter et al., 1996</xref>). In this regard, mutations in Kap95p and Apq12p have been described that exhibit the accumulation of NPC intermediates similar to those we have documented in the Nup170p- and Nup157p-depleted cells. The phenotype of the <italic>kap95</italic> mutant may be particularly relevant to our observations, as it disrupts the localization of Nup170p, thus raising the possibility that the phenotype of the kap mutant is, at least in part, caused by a defect in the targeting of Nup170p to its site of function in pore formation. Importantly, the <italic>kap95</italic> mutant also exhibits a synthetic sick phenotype in combination with a functionally compromised <italic>nup170-GFP</italic> allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ryan et al., 2007</xref>). We have previously proposed the idea that kaps play an important role in NPC assembly through their targeting of nups to the inner nuclear membrane, where assembly intermediates would be formed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Marelli et al., 2001</xref>). In these studies, Kap121p was shown to assist in the targeting of Nup53p to NPCs, and it was required for the inner membrane proliferation induced by overexpression of <italic>NUP53</italic>. In light of the phenotypic similarities between the <italic>kap95</italic> mutant and the Nup170p- and Nup157p-depleted cells, a similar role for Kap95p in targeting Nup170p and possibly other nups, including Nup2p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dilworth et al., 2001</xref>), to the nucleoplasm seems reasonable.</p><p>In addition to contributing a nuclear targeting function, it has been suggested that Kap95p may play a role in the assembly of the cytoplasmic face of the NPC, functioning here to regulate the fusion of putative nup-containing vesicles to the outer nuclear membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ryan et al., 2007</xref>). Consistent with a cytoplasmic role for Kap95p, we also detected Kap95-GFP in association with the cytoplasmic nup foci formed after the loss of Nup170p and Nup157p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6</xref>). The time course of the appearance of Kap95-GFP foci after depletion paralleled that of cytoplasmic nups, which suggests that the association of Kap95 with these foci is linked to this group of nups. Whether or not these cytoplasmic foci are membrane associated remains to be addressed.</p><p>Null mutants lacking the integral ER and NE membrane protein Apq12p also contain mislocalized cytoplasmic nups and inner nuclear membrane&#x02013;associated, NPC-like structures when grown at a semipermissive temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Scarcelli et al., 2007</xref>). Moreover, combinations of <italic>apq12&#x00394;</italic> and mutations in several NPC components, including Pom34p, Ndc1p, and Nup170p, exhibit synthetic growth defects, with an <italic>apq12&#x00394; nup170&#x00394;</italic> mutant showing especially strong defects in nuclear membrane structure. Although the role of Apq12p in NPC assembly remains to be clearly established, it has been proposed that it contributes to membrane fluidity by modulating the lipid composition of the NE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Scarcelli et al., 2007</xref>). This conclusion is based, in part, on the observation that benzyl alcohol treatment of <italic>apq12&#x00394;</italic> cells can induce the dispersion of the cytoplasmic nup foci and the recruitment of their nups to the NE, presumably stimulating their assembly into NPCs. We observed a similar effect using hexane-1, 6-diol treatment of <italic>apq12&#x00394;</italic> cells. Thus, alcohols can suppress the defects caused by the loss of Apq12p. However, hexane-1, 6-diol treatment of cells depleted of Nup170p and Nup157p, although capable of dispersing cytoplasmic nup foci, did not induce their incorporation into the NE. Based on the phenotypic similarities caused by the loss of either Apq12p or Nup170p and Nup157p, we conclude that they likely function at a similar point in NPC assembly, but that their different responses to alcohol suggest they contribute to distinct aspects of the process. The relationships between these proteins are again consistent with a role for Nup170p and Nup157p in mediating structural changes in the NE membrane that drive formation of the pore membrane and contribute to its stability. Although they required for these essential processes, Nup170p and Nup157p are expected to function in concert with pore membrane proteins, Apq12p, and other nups to guide these events. Understanding the physical relationships between these proteins and the pore membrane will be a key next step in further understanding the mechanisms of nuclear pore formation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="Materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Yeast strains, media, and plasmids</title><p>Yeast strains used in this study are shown in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200810029/DC1">Table S1</ext-link>.
