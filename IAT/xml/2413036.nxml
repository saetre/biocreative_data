We focus here on the ubiquitin ligase Fbw7, a recently identified hematopoietic tumor suppressor that can target for degradation several important oncogenes, including Notch1, c-Myc, and cyclin E. We have generated conditional Fbw7 knockout animals and inactivated the gene in hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), progenitors, and their differentiated progeny. Deletion of Fbw7 specifically and rapidly affects hematopoiesis in a cell-autonomous manner. Fbw7<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> HSCs show defective maintenance of quiescence, leading to impaired self-renewal and a severe loss of competitive repopulating capacity. Furthermore, Fbw7<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> progenitors are unable to colonize the thymus, leading to a profound depletion of T cell progenitors. Deletion of Fbw7 in bone marrow (BM) stem cells and progenitors leads to the stabilization of c-Myc, a transcription factor previously implicated in HSC self-renewal. On the other hand, neither Notch1 nor cyclin E is visibly stabilized in the BM of Fbw7-deficient mice. Gene expression studies of Fbw7<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> HSCs and hematopoietic progenitors indicate that Fbw7 regulates, through the regulation of HSC cycle entry, the transcriptional &#x0201c;signature&#x0201d; that is associated with the quiescent, self-renewing HSC phenotype.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used: DN, double negative; ES, embryonic stem; ETP, early T cell progenitor; HSC, hematopoietic stem cell; LSK, lineage<sup>&#x02212;</sup>Sca-1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>c-Kit<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>; LT-HSC; long-term HSC; MP, myeloid progenitor; SCF, Skp1/Cul1/F-box protein; T-ALL, T cell&#x02013;acute lymphoblastic leukemia.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><p>All mature blood cells arise from primitive progenitor cells in the BM. These rare and specialized cells, called hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), exist mostly in a quiescent state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>). Cell division of HSCs results in both their progressive proliferation and differentiation into increasingly lineage-restricted mature blood cells, as well as maintenance of a small pool of HSCs that do not differentiate, but rather carry out hematopoiesis throughout the life of an organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>). Much work has been done to elucidate the nature of the signals that govern the balance between self-renewal and differentiation of HSCs. The BM microenvironment in which these cells reside, called the HSC niche, is thought to nurture this balance by providing the appropriate signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>), but the identities and precise coordination of these signals have only recently begun to be understood.</p><p>As the entire life of an HSC revolves around the decisions of whether or not and when to divide, it is no surprise that several molecules and signaling pathways that could regulate cell cycle have been implicated in HSC biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>). For example, the proto-oncogene c-Myc has been shown to be essential for regulating both HSC self-renewal and differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). The effects of c-Myc deletion in the BM are alleviated by simultaneous deletion of the cell cycle inhibitor p21 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>), underscoring the requirement for strict cell cycle regulation to ensure proper HSC function. Both p21 and c-Myc are regulated at the transcriptional level by the Rho GTPase Cdc42, and deletion of Cdc42 from hematopoietic cells results in increased and decreased levels of c-Myc and p21, respectively, and allows quiescent HSCs to enter the cell cycle and differentiate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>).</p><p>In addition to c-Myc, the Notch pathway has also been suggested to influence HSC function. Notch1 signaling is essential during hematopoiesis for the development of T lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>), but studies of its role in HSCs have yielded a mixture of results and interpretations. For example, inhibition of Notch1 signaling in vivo can deplete the HSC compartment, possibly by promoting their differentiation into more mature, lineage-restricted cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>). Also, Stier et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>) suggested that Notch pathway activation increases HSC self-renewal in vivo. On the other hand, several genetic studies questioned the importance of Notch1 signaling at this stage. Initially, deletion of the central Notch effector RBP-J (signal binding protein-J) caused no significant HSC or progenitor-specific phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>). Similarly, no gross hematopoietic defects were reported when either the Notch ligand Jagged1 or the Notch regulators Numb and Numblike were conditionally deleted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>).</p><p>Although it is clear that the expression of numerous cell cycle regulators must be tightly controlled in HSCs to permit both their self-renewal and differentiation, the molecular pathways that provide such control are mostly unclear. Notch1 and c-Myc, as well as other cell cycle regulators like cyclin E and c-Jun, are targeted for proteasomal degradation by the E3 ubiquitin ligase, Fbw7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>). Fbw7 (also called Fbxw7, hCDC4, Ago, and SEL-10) is an F-box protein that serves as a receptor molecule for the Skp1/Cul1/F-box protein (SCF) ubiquitination complex. Fbw7 binds substrates (e.g., Notch1 and c-Myc) by recognizing a phosphorylated motif (a degron) via its WD40 repeat domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>). Fbw7 is simultaneously bound via its F-box domain to the adaptor protein Skp1, which in turn is bound to the RING finger protein Rbx1 via the scaffold protein Cul1, which allows recruitment of target proteins for poly ubiquitination by an Rbx1-associated ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>); this marks the target protein for degradation by the 26S proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>).</p><p>Our laboratory and others have recently shown that inactivating mutations in Fbw7 contribute to the accumulation of Notch1 and c-Myc in T cell&#x02013;acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>), and several other studies have established Fbw7 as an important tumor suppressor in various tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>). Furthermore, growing evidence suggests that the ubiquitin&#x02013;proteasome system plays diverse and essential roles in stem cell biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>). The ability of Fbw7 to antagonize cell cycle progression via the ubiquitin&#x02013;proteasome system prompted us to study the effects of deleting it from hematopoietic cells. As germline Fbw7 knockout mice die in utero around day E10.5 due to defects in vascular development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>), we have generated a conditional allele to allow tissue-specific inactivation of Fbw7 on expression of Cre recombinase. We report here that loss of Fbw7 function leads to a severe depletion of the HSC pool and HSC self-renewal capacity due to the loss of stem cell quiescence. This functional phenotype coincides with a perturbed expression of critical molecular regulators of cell cycle entry in HSCs and a profound decrease in the expression of gene transcripts associated with the HSC self-renewal phenotype.</p><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Fbw7 expression patterns during early hematopoietic differentiation</title><p>To study the pattern of Fbw7 expression during early hematopoiesis, we have initially purified the HSC-containing lineage<sup>&#x02212;</sup>Sca-1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>c-Kit<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> (LSK) fraction as well as more differentiated myeloid progenitors (MPs; lineage<sup>&#x02212;</sup>Sca-1<sup>&#x02212;</sup>c-Kit<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>), B cell progenitors (B220<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>CD43<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>), and thymic T cell (lineage<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD44<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>25<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>) progenitors. As shown in Fig. S1 A (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080277/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080277/DC1</ext-link>), Fbw7 mRNA expression was high at the LSK stage and decreased as the cells differentiated into the myeloid lineage (MP: lineage<sup>&#x02212;</sup>c-kit<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>Sca-1<sup>&#x02212;</sup>). B cell progenitors expressed moderate amounts of Fbw7 message, whereas in the thymus, the first T cell&#x02013;committed progenitors (CD44<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>25<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>) expressed high amounts of Fbw7. There was no significant expression difference during CD4<sup>&#x02212;</sup>8<sup>&#x02212;</sup> to CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> transition. However, single positive (CD4 or CD8) T cells appear to express lower levels of Fbw7 message (Fig. S1 B). The levels of Cullin 1, a partner of Fbw7 for the formation of the SCF complex, follow similar&#x02014;although not identical&#x02014;expression patterns. Finally, to gain further insight in the putative function of Fbw7 during early hematopoiesis, we have generated PCR primers specific for the three distinct Fbw7 isoforms. We were surprised to see that mouse hematopoietic cells express only the Fbw7&#x003b1; isoform that is exclusively localized in the cell nucleoplasm (Fig. S1 C). These studies suggested a dynamic control of Fbw7 expression at different stages of hematopoietic differentiation.</p></sec><sec><title>Generation of a conditional Fbw7 allele (Fbw7<sup>f/f</sup>)</title><p>As the early lethality of the Fbw7<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> embryos precludes any study of hematopoietic differentiation, we generated an Fbw7-conditional allele targeting exons 5 and 6, as they encode for the F-box domain that is essential for SCF assembly (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). We have used standard embryonic stem (ES) cell&#x02013;targeting techniques and &#x0201c;floxed&#x0201d; these two exons with LoxP sites. We have also inserted an Frt-&#x0201c;floxed&#x0201d; Neo mini-gene that was later deleted (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>) from the germline of the generated chimeric progeny (see Materials and methods).

As shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 (B and C)</xref>, three polyI-polyC intraperitoneal injections are sufficient to induce total Fbw7 locus deletion and efficiently silence Fbw7 expression in several lymphoid tissues, including the BM, the thymus, and the spleen. The deletion was also total in the BM LSK fraction (see <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Generation of a conditional Fbw7 allele.</bold> (A) Targeting strategy showing exons 4&#x02013;7 of the mouse genomic Fbw7 locus before targeting (WT allele) and after homologous recombination in C57BL/6 &#x000d7; 129 ES cells (targeted allele), which introduces an FRT- and LoxP-flanked PGK-Neo cassette between exons 6 and 7, and flanks exons 5 and 6 with LoxP sites.

After induction of Mx-Cre with polyI-polyC injections, the floxed band was lost from the BM and thymus, and excision of exons 5 and 6 in these tissues was confirmed by PCR using primers A and C, which amplify 662 bp from the CKO allele.

As early as 2 wk after the end of the polyI-polyC treatment, there was a significant reduction in the absolute number of total BM cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). We should note here that control littermates were either Mx-cre<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> Fbw7<sup>wt/wt</sup> or Mx-cre<sup>&#x02212;</sup> Fbw7<sup>f/f</sup> mice and were also polyI-polyC injected. As our goal was to study the potential effects of Fbw7 deletion on HSC homeostasis, we turned our attention to the lineage<sup>&#x02212;</sup> compartment. It was immediately obvious that Fbw7 deletion rapidly (at 2 wk after polyI-polyC) and significantly affected LSK frequency. Most importantly, absolute numbers of LSK cells decreased three- to fivefold (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>). A significant decrease in the numbers of the first MPs (lineage<sup>&#x02212;</sup>Sca-1<sup>&#x02212;</sup>c-Kit<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>) was also seen, but there were no significant differences in the relative abundance of common, megakaryocyte-erythrocyte, and granulocyte-monocyte progenitors (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 E</xref>). In agreement with these findings, the LSK frequency in the peripheral blood (not depicted) and spleen (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>) was also decreased. Further subdivision of the LSK fraction to long-term HSC (LT-HSC), short-term HSC, and multipotential progenitors (using a combination of CD34 and c-kit staining) did not reveal any subset-specific effects but suggested a more general effect on LSK homeostasis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D</xref>). As a consequence of the HSC defect, absolute numbers of all BM-mature lineages, including the numbers of immature (B220<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>IgM<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>) and mature B cells, were also significantly decreased (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 F</xref>). These findings strongly suggested that Fbw7 deletion could affect LSK cell self-renewal and/or differentiation in the BM.</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Fbw7 deletion leads to a depletion of BM hematopoietic progenitors.</bold> (A) Absolute numbers of BM cells in polyI-polyC&#x02013;injected control (Fbw7<sup>f/f</sup>, MxCre<sup>&#x02212;</sup>) and CKO (Fbw7<sup>f/f</sup>, MxCre<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>) mice 2 wk after polyI-polyC deletion are shown.

Notch1 appeared to be the main Fbw7 substrate in the thymus, as its deletion led to a significant accumulation of intracellular Notch1 protein as detected by two different Notch1-specific antibodies (Fig. S2 A, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080277/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080277/DC1</ext-link>).

Indeed, when we deleted Fbw7 only in developing thymocytes using the Lck promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>) (Lck-cre<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>Fbw7<sup>f/f</sup>), none of these DN cell&#x02013;specific phenotypes were obvious (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 F</xref> and Fig. S3 A). This could be explained by the later Fbw7 gene deletion in the Lck-cre model (Fig. S3 B). 4-wk-old Lck-cre<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>Fbw7<sup>f/f</sup> mice had thymocyte numbers similar to Lck-cre<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>Fbw7<sup>wt/wt</sup> control littermates, and almost 50% of them developed T cell lymphomas later in life (unpublished data and reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>). Both Notch1 and c-Myc appeared to be stabilized in the thymi of these mice. Notch1 was also stabilized in immature CD4<sup>&#x02212;</sup>8<sup>&#x02212;</sup> thymocytes (not depicted). To further investigate the hypothesis that the thymic phenotype was at least partially due to the decreased number of entering BM stem and progenitor cells, we have quantified the absolute number of the first thymic immigrants (early T cell progenitors [ETPs], defined as lineage<sup>&#x02212;</sup>CD25<sup>&#x02212;</sup>c-kit<sup>high</sup> cells) in the thymi of control and mutant mice 2 and 4 wk after polyI-polyC injection. As shown in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 G</xref>, ETP numbers were significantly decreased upon Fbw7 deletion at both time points. Our studies demonstrated that deletion of Fbw7 using the Mx-cre<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>Fbw7<sup>f/f</sup> model severely affects lymphocyte development in the thymus.</p></sec><sec><title>Loss of Fbw7 leads to a cell-autonomous defect of stem cell self-renewal</title><p>As the Mx1 promoter is IFN-&#x003b1; responsive and can drive cre-recombinase expression in nonhematopoietic lineages (e.g., the BM HSC niche), we have tested whether the reported phenotypes were cell autonomous.

We should note here that in this assay we expected &#x0003c;50% CD45.2 chimerism due to the existence of endogenous, host-derived CD45.1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells. The exact CD45.2 chimerism depended on the injection efficiency and in our hands varied from 10 to 45%. Indeed, although Mx-cre<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>Fbw7<sup>wt/wt</sup> cells efficiently competed (generating &#x0003e;40% chimerism) with CD45.1 BM, Mx-cre<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>Fbw7<sup>f/f</sup> cells generated only minimal chimerism in the spleen, thymus, and BM of the recipient animals, suggesting a very severe defect in their ability to differentiate and replenish the hematopoietic and immune systems (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>). Interestingly, when we studied chimerism in the LSK compartment we found almost no Fbw7<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> LSK cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref>).

Interestingly, these effects appear to be LSK specific, as more differentiated cell populations (MPs, T cell progenitors, CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> thymocytes) do not show similar cell cycle acceleration (Fig. S5, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080277/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20080277/DC1</ext-link>).

In agreement with this scenario, Fbw7 expression is significantly down-regulated as LSKs differentiate to become MPs (Fig. S1). To further understand the role of Fbw7 during physiological HSC proliferation and differentiation, we purified LSK cells and placed them in cytokine-driven in vitro cultures.

Fbw7 expression declined significantly in response to cytokine stimulation, and Cul1 expression followed an identical pattern (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 B</xref>).

These transcripts are enriched in LT-HSCs and down-regulated upon the loss of self-renewal properties. We thus hypothesized that the transcriptional signature of Fbw7 deletion in HSCs contains the features of the physiological loss of stem cell phenotype associated with the commitment to the transiently amplifying progenitor fate. Such a hypothesis was supported by the identities of genes specifically affected by Fbw7 deletion in the LSK compartment (not depicted), including <italic>Evi1</italic>, <italic>Mpl</italic>, <italic>p57</italic>, <italic>Agpt</italic>, <italic>Eya1/2</italic>, <italic>Pbx3</italic>, and <italic>Meis1</italic>, which were all previously shown to be enriched in self-renewing HSCs (Table S1). These results were further verified using quantitative RT-PCR analysis of distinct biological samples (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 B</xref>) and were perfectly in line with the presented phenotypic results, which suggested a loss of HSC quiescence and self-renewal capacity upon Fbw7 deletion. Importantly, the observed global loss of HSC-specific transcriptional signature was not an artifact from contaminating Sca-1<sup>low/&#x02212;</sup> cells, as the Ly6A (Sca-1)&#x02013;specific signal was even slightly higher in the Fbw7<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> compared with the control LSK sample (not depicted).</p><p>This loss of &#x0201c;LT-HSC&#x02013;specific&#x0201d; gene expression was accompanied by the activation of a more differentiated gene expression program in cells that lose Fbw7 expression. Indeed, several genes suggesting an erythro-myeloid and lymphoid priming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>) were up-regulated upon Fbw7 loss (i.e., glycophorin A, CD36, neutrophil elastase, Rag-1, etc.; not depicted). This is consistent with the presented expression analysis data that show that Fbw7 mRNA expression decreases during the transition of undifferentiated LSK cells to the committed progenitor stage, which could be a functional part of the early HSC differentiation program.</p><p>Finally, we have searched for genes that could explain the loss of stem cell quiescence upon Fbw7 deletion. As shown in <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 C</xref>, several cell cycle regulators, including p27, p21, and Ccnd2/3, were unaffected by the deletion of Fbw7. However, the expression of three cell cycle&#x02013;related genes was altered in response to Fbw7 silencing. The cyclin kinase inhibitor p57<sup>kip2</sup>, previously implicated in loss of quiescence of stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>), was down-regulated in Mx-cre<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>Fbw7<sup>f/f</sup> LSK cells. On the other hand, the cell cycle regulator E2F2 was significantly up-regulated upon Fbw7 loss. Finally, the D-type cyclin Ccnd1 was up-regulated after Fbw7 gene excision, in agreement with its role in HSC cycle entry. Interestingly, all three genes have been previously suggested to be targets of c-Myc, supporting our view that c-Myc overexpression could be an important regulator of cell cycle entry downstream of Fbw7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref>). The presented expression studies provide a very strong mechanistic basis that explains the phenotypic and functional effects of Fbw7 deletion on HSC quiescence and self-renewal.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In this report we demonstrate that a single E3 ubiquitin ligase, Fbw7, is an essential regulator of HSC quiescence and self-renewal. Fbw7 is expressed in quiescent HSCs, and its expression is down-regulated upon the loss of their self-renewing capacity. These effects are cell autonomous, as Fbw7<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> LSKs are unable to compete with WT counterparts both in vitro and in vivo. The loss of LSK absolute numbers and self-renewal abilities are also reflected at the early stages of lymphopoiesis, as Mx-cre<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>Fbw7<sup>f/f</sup> mice have lower numbers of B cell, and almost no T cell, progenitors. To mechanistically explain these LSK phenotypes, we have performed comparative gene expression studies using Fbw7<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> stem cells and MPs. These studies demonstrated that Fbw7 deletion targets specific cell cycle regulators and suppresses the expression of several genes previously suggested to control HSC function. Thus, we have identified a novel function for the proteasome&#x02013;ubiquitin ligase complex as a genetic &#x0201c;switch&#x0201d; that controls HSC cycle entry and self-renewal.</p><p>Our studies are in agreement with a recent report by Matsuoka et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref>). These investigators also demonstrate that Fbw7 is essential to maintain HSC quiescence and self-renewal, and suggest that c-Myc is a key Fbw7 substrate in HSCs. They also report that Fbw7<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> animals die by either extreme pancytopenia at 12 wk after polyI-polyC injection or by T-ALL. Development of T-ALL was a later event, as disease appeared only after 16 wk after treatment. Only very few (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 2) of our polyI-polyC&#x02013;injected Fbw7<sup>f/f</sup> animals were allowed to reach these time points, and all developed pancytopenia. Thus, we cannot directly compare rates of T-ALL induction, as all other polyI-polyC&#x02013;injected animals presented in this study were analyzed at very early time points. However, both Fbw7-targeted animals developed T-ALL with similar kinetics when crossed to the Lck-cre strain (unpublished data and reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>). A discrepancy between the two studies exists over the detection of apoptosis in Fbw7<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> LSK cells. However, Matsuoka et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref>) reported elevated percentages of apoptosis only in HSCs purified from the marrows of severely cytopenic mice 12 wk after deletion. In the studies presented here, the analysis was performed using LSK cells purified from noncytopenic Fbw7<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice 3 wk after polyI-polyC deletion. At that time point there was a significant alteration of HSC quiescence and a reduction of LSK (and LT-HSC) absolute cell numbers. In agreement with our findings, Matsuoka et al.

Also, in the neural system, the Mindbomb1 ligase regulates expression of Notch ligands and consequently controls differentiation of neural stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref>). Finally, DDB1, an E3 ligase member of the cullin4A complex, is important for the viability, genomic integrity, and maintenance of neural stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref>). Information on the role of any of the multiple E3 ligases on HSC function is scarce and indirect. Studies using a panel of chemical proteasome inhibitors have shown that suppression of proteasome function induced cell death in human CD34<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> hematopoietic progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref>). Moreover, primary CD34<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> leukemic stem cells also enter apoptosis in response to treatment with the MG-132 proteasome inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">49</xref>). However, these were crude experiments that cannot address the complexity of regulation of proteasome function in HSCs by the different ubiquitin ligase complexes. Experiments similar to the ones described in this report, which include E3 ligase expression mapping and gene-targeting experiments, are thus essential for the detailed understanding of the importance of ubiquitination in HSC function.</p><p>Multiple protein substrates of Fbw7 have been identified. These include the cell cycle regulator cyclin E and transcription factors such as c-Myc and Notch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">50</xref>) that could directly or indirectly regulate stem cell function. Our protein expression analyses showed no stabilization of Notch1 in the BM of Mx-cre<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>Fbw7<sup>f/f</sup> mice. In fact, we were unable to detect any Notch1-IC protein expression at all. This was not due to any technical obstacle, as Notch1 was significantly stabilized and overexpressed in the thymus of these mice. Also, we were unable to detect CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells in the Fbw7<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> BM (not depicted), usually a reliable and rapid indicator of aberrant Notch activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">52</xref>). However, we cannot exclude that Notch stabilization occurs in a small fraction of LSK cells, and this change in protein expression is below the sensitivity of the experimental method used. Indeed, Matsuoka et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref>) detected Notch1 overexpression using confocal microscopy of individual Fbw7<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> LSK cells. In agreement with these results, our RT-PCR analysis of Fbw7<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> LSK cells has revealed a persistent overexpression of Hes-1 and Deltex-1, both well-characterized targets of the Notch pathway (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8 C</xref>).</p><p>Similar studies excluded a role for stabilization of another Fbw7 substrate, cyclin E. Indeed, we were unable to detect any significant cyclin E stabilization in response to Fbw7 deletion in either total BM cells or purified stem cell and progenitor populations. These findings are consistent with genetic experiments reported by Loeb et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">51</xref>). These investigators have generated &#x0201c;knock-in&#x0201d; mice that express a mutated cyclin E, cyclin E<sup>T393A</sup>. T393 falls within a canonical Fbw7 recognition degron, and its phosphorylation allows Fbw7 to bind and ubiquitinate cyclin E. Mutated cyclin E was stabilized and expressed at levels several-fold higher in several tissues, including lymphocytes and thymocytes. Despite this overexpression, cyclin E<sup>T393A</sup>&#x02013;homozygous mice showed no phenotypic abnormalities in all tissues examined, including the immune system. They also displayed a normal life span with no significant predisposition to autoimmune disease or tumor induction. Together with our protein expression analyses, these elegant genetic studies argue against a role of cyclin E stabilization in HSC function in response to Fbw7 deletion.</p><p>On the other hand, our studies suggested that c-Myc could be an attractive target, especially because it was previously shown to be involved in HSC differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). Indeed, both total and phosphorylated c-Myc protein was consistently up-regulated in Fbw7<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> BM stem cells and progenitors. These observations were consistent with the confocal microscopy studies reported by Matsuoka et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref>), strongly suggesting that c-Myc is indeed an important Fbw7 substrate. Putative targets of c-Myc, including p57<sup>kip2</sup>, E2F2, and Ccnd1, were also up-regulated in Fbw7<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> LSK cells. In agreement with this hypothesis, Wilson et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>) have performed experiments in which they have overexpressed c-Myc specifically in LSK cells. Despite proper homing and inhibition of apoptosis, c-Myc&#x02013;overexpressing HSCs failed to self-renew, a phenotype similar to the one reported here (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>). We should add here that although c-Myc appears to represent an important Fbw7 target, it is possible that there are other yet-unidentified Fbw7 substrates that are important for the hematopoietic phenotypes reported here.</p><p>Our presented studies identify Fbw7 as a novel essential regulator of HSC quiescence and self-renewal. Initially, deletion of Fbw7, which was normally expressed at high levels in noncycling HSCs, affects the expression of key regulators of cell cycle entry, including the D-type cyclin Ccnd1, the cell cycle inhibitor p57<sup>kip2</sup>, and the downstream transcriptional effector E2F2. The combined action of these regulators could induce exit from quiescence and cell cycle entry, as the BrdU incorporation experiments convincingly demonstrated that upon Fbw7 deletion &#x0003e;80% of LT-HSCs have entered cell cycle. It is tempting to hypothesize that aberrant cell cycle entry forces Fbw7<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> HSCs to exit the quiescent niche and lose their self-renewing ability. Once more, our expression studies provide mechanistic support to this hypothesis. Fbw7 deletion dramatically suppresses the expression of several genes (<italic>Mpl</italic>, <italic>Pbx3</italic>, <italic>p57</italic>, <italic>Meis1</italic>, <italic>Evi1</italic>, <italic>Eya1/2</italic>, <italic>Angpt</italic>, <italic>Thy1</italic>, and <italic>Ndn</italic>) that define a partial &#x0201c;LT-HSC&#x0201d; transcriptional signature (Table S1 and unpublished data).</p><p>The identification of Fbw7 as a key regulator of HSC quiescence and self-renewal may have very significant biological repercussions. Initially, Fbw7 function could be important for self-renewal of cancer stem cells with important implications in the therapeutic targeting of their maintenance. In agreement with this notion, Fbw7 deletion suppresses the expression of several genes involved in hematopoietic transformation (<italic>Ccnd1</italic>, <italic>Evi1</italic>, <italic>Pbx3</italic>, and <italic>Meis1</italic>). It is intriguing to mention here that Fbw7 can also function as a tumor suppressor when deleted in T cells using the Lck-cre<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>Fbw7<sup>f/f</sup> model (reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref> and unpublished data), suggesting that Fbw7 function in oncogenesis could differ between uncommitted stem cells, committed progenitors, and mature lymphocytes. For all these reasons, the identification of regulators of Fbw7 activity, including specific deubiquitinating enzymes or substrate-specific priming kinases, could be valuable for both the development of HSC transplantation protocols and the suppression of transformation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>Generation of the Fbw7<sup>flox</sup> mice.</title><p>An &#x0223c;11.5-kb region used to generate the targeting vector was subcloned from a positively identified C57B6 BAC clone using homologous recombination.
