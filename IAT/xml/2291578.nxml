Gene expression studies in A673 Ewing's sarcoma cells have demonstrated that EWS/FLI downregulates more genes than it upregulates, suggesting that EWS/FLI, and/or its targets, function as transcriptional repressors. One critical EWS/FLI target, NKX2.2, is a transcription factor that contains both transcriptional activation and transcriptional repression domains, raising the possibility that it mediates portions of the EWS/FLI transcriptional signature. We now report that microarray analysis demonstrated that the transcriptional profile of NKX2.2 consists solely of downregulated genes, and overlaps with the EWS/FLI downregulated signature, suggesting that NKX2.2 mediates oncogenic transformation via transcriptional repression. Structure-function analysis revealed that the DNA binding and repressor domains in NKX2.2 are required for oncogenesis in Ewing's sarcoma cells, while the transcriptional activation domain is completely dispensable. Furthermore, blockade of TLE or HDAC function, two protein families thought to mediate the repressive function of NKX2.2, inhibited the transformed phenotype and reversed the NKX2.2 transcriptional profile in Ewing's sarcoma cells. Whole genome localization studies (ChIP-chip) revealed that a significant portion of the NKX2.2-repressed gene expression signature was directly mediated by NKX2.2 binding. These data demonstrate that the transcriptional repressive function of NKX2.2 is necessary, and sufficient, for the oncogenic phenotype of Ewing's sarcoma, and suggest a therapeutic approach to this disease.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="7"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Ewing's sarcoma is an aggressive bone and soft tissue tumor of adolescents and young adults <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001965-Grier1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

Endogenous NKX2.2 was knocked down in either A673 or SK-N-MC patient-derived Ewing's sarcoma cells using a retrovirally-encoded short hairpin RNA (shRNA) directed against the 3&#x02032; UTR of the transcript (NKX-RNAi; ref. 8). Wild type or mutant NKX2.2 cDNAs containing 3xFLAG epitope tags were introduced using retroviral vectors. These cDNAs did not contain the endogenous 3&#x02032; UTR, and thus were unaffected by the shRNA. Knockdown of endogenous NKX2.2 results in a severe diminution of oncogenic transformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001965-g001">Figure 1B</xref>; ref. 8). Expression of 3xFLAG wild-type NKX2.2 rescued the loss of transformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001965-g001">Figure 1B</xref>) as efficiently as non-tagged wild-type protein (data not shown).</p><p>We found that introduction of a point mutation (N178Q) into the HD DNA binding domain, deletion of the transcriptional repression domain (&#x00394;TN), or deletion of the specific domain (&#x00394;SD), each resulted in a loss of oncogenic rescue activity following knockdown of endogenous NKX2.2. However, a mutant lacking the transcriptional activation domain (&#x00394;TAD) completely rescued transformation. All mutants were expressed at levels equal to the wild-type protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001965-g001">Figure 1C</xref>), and were appropriately localized to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001965.s002">Figure S1A</xref>). In addition, we found that all mutant constructs maintained their ability to bind DNA, except the N178Q DNA binding domain mutant which showed significantly reduced DNA binding as demonstrated by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001965.s002">Figure S1B</xref>; ref. 18). Importantly, we observed no significant differences in growth characteristics of cells expressing these NKX2.2 mutants in comparison to wild-type controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001965.s002">Figure S1C</xref>). Based on these data, the TN, HD and SD domains of NKX2.2 are required for oncogenic transformation in Ewing's sarcoma, while the TAD domain is dispensable.</p><p>The importance of the transcriptional repression and DNA binding domains suggests a critical role for NKX2.2-mediated transcriptional repression in the pathogenesis of Ewing's sarcoma. However, the additional importance of the specific domain (SD) for transformation was more difficult to reconcile with this model of NKX2.2 function. The SD lies adjacent to the TAD and blocks its function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001965-g001">Figure 1A</xref>; ref. 18). Removal of the SD then allows for expression of the transcriptional activation function of TAD. Therefore, we hypothesized that NKX2.2-mediated transcriptional activation is deleterious to oncogenic transformation. In support of this hypothesis, additional deletion of TAD when the SD is absent results in a mutant (&#x00394;SD/&#x00394;TAD; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001965-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) that has full oncogenic function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001965-g001">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p>We next asked if the TN transcriptional repression domain was sufficient for NKX2.2-mediated transformation. An NKX2.2 mutant construct was developed containing only the TN and HD domains (TN-HD fusion; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001965-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). This mutant was fully functional in the oncogenic transformation rescue assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001965-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). As with the other NKX2.2 mutant constructs, TN-HD was expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001965-g002">Figure 2C</xref>), localized to the nucleus, bound DNA appropriately, and displayed normal growth in tissue culture (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001965.s003">Figure S2A-S2C</xref>). Thus, the DNA binding and transcriptional repression domains are necessary and sufficient for the oncogenic function of NKX2.2.</p><fig id="pone-0001965-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0001965.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>The TN and HD domains are sufficient to rescue NKX2.2-mediated Ewing's sarcoma oncogenic transformation.</title><p>(A) Schematic diagram of the 3xFLAG-tagged TN-HD fusion protein.

The structure-function data presented here raises the possibility that at least a portion of the EWS/FLI downregulated signature is indirectly mediated by NKX2.2. To test this hypothesis explicitly, we determined the transcriptional profile of NKX2.2. Triplicate polyclonal populations of A673 Ewing's sarcoma cells were prepared harboring the NKX-RNAi retroviral construct, or a control luc-RNAi construct. An additional set of cells was prepared which contained the NKX-RNAi knockdown construct with either the wild-type 3xFLAG-tagged NKX2.2 cDNA, or an empty vector control. Thus, two classes of samples were defined: (1) &#x0201c;NKX2.2-expressed&#x0201d; (luc-RNAi and NKX-RNAi/NKX2.2 cDNA rescue cells) and (2) &#x0201c;NKX2.2-knockdown&#x0201d; (NKX-RNAi and NKX-RNAi/&#x0201c;empty-vector&#x0201d; rescue). The transcriptional profile was determined using Affymetrix U133plus2 microarrays. The signal-to-noise metric and permutation testing at the 99&#x00025; confidence level were used to identify genes whose expression depended on NKX2.2. Consistent with our hypothesis that it functions as a transcriptional repressor, we found that NKX2.2 downregulated 159 probesets (i.e., genes), but none were upregulated by the protein.</p><p>To determine whether the NKX2.2 signature contributes to the EWS/FLI downregulated transcriptional profile, we compared these data. To facilitate a direct comparison between these profiles using the same microarray platform, we prepared A673 Ewing's sarcoma cells consisting of &#x0201c;EWS/FLI-expressed&#x0201d; (luc-RNAi and EF-2-RNAi/EWS/FLI cDNA rescue cells) or &#x0201c;EWS/FLI-knockdown&#x0201d; (EF-2-RNAi and EF-2-RNAi/&#x0201c;empty-vector&#x0201d; rescue) classes, and analyzed them on Affymetrix U133plus2 microarrays. As with the NKX2.2 dataset, we used the signal-to-noise metric and permutation testing at the 99&#x00025; confidence level. We found that only 469 genes were upregulated by EWS/FLI, while 3075 genes were downregulated. This ratio of up- to downregulated genes was similar to what has been previously published, and therefore provides an independent validation of the data we, and others, have reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001965-Smith1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001965-Prieur1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Chi square analysis was used to compare the NKX2.2 and EWS/FLI datasets. We found that 72 of the 159 NKX2.2 downregulated genes were also downregulated by EWS/FLI (p&#x0003c;0.00001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001965-g003">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001965.s001">Table S1</xref>). To evaluate these data using a different statistical approach, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA; ref. 20) was used to compare these datasets. GSEA measures the enrichment of one gene list against a second rank-ordered dataset using a running sum statistic called the normalized enrichment score. This analysis demonstrated that EWS/FLI downregulated genes were highly enriched for the NKX2.2 downregulated geneset (NES&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;&#x02212;1.7; p&#x0003c;0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001965-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Thus, both approaches demonstrate that NKX2.2 mediates a statistically significant portion of the EWS/FLI downregulated transcriptional signature. These data suggest a model whereby EWS/FLI upregulates NKX2.2, which then mediates a subset of the EWS/FLI downregulated transcriptional signature.</p><fig id="pone-0001965-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0001965.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>NKX2.2 downregulated target genes are enriched in the EWS/FLI downregulated dataset.</title><p>(A) Venn diagram representation of the overlap between EWS/FLI downregulated genes and NKX2.2 downregulated genes.

To address this question directly, we analyzed the transcriptional profile of A673 Ewing's sarcoma cells treated with a concentration of vorinostat sufficient to induce histone acetylation, yet minimally affect growth in tissue culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001965-g005">Figure 5C</xref> and data not shown).</p><p>We used GSEA to compare the transcriptional profiles of A673 Ewing's sarcoma cells treated with vorinostat to the same cells in which NKX2.2 was knocked down. The gene expression data from vorinostat-treated cells were rank ordered using the signal-to-noise statistic. The 159 genes downregulated by NKX2.2 were found to be enriched among the genes that were upregulated by vorinostat (NES&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;1.71; p&#x0003c;0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001965-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). Thus, vorinostat reverses the NKX2.2-mediated transcriptional signature. Similarly, when this analysis was performed using the 72 genes found to be downregulated by both EWS/FLI and NKX2.2, we found these genes to cluster equally strongly with genes that were upregulated by vorinostat (NES&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;1.68; p&#x0003c;0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001965-g005">Figure 5E</xref>). This strongly suggests that HDAC-mediated gene repression is involved in the transcriptional function of NKX2.2 in Ewing's sarcoma.</p><p>Taken together, these data suggest that NKX2.2 mediates repression of its targets by directly binding to their promoters. To test this hypothesis, we performed whole genome localization studies (ChIP-chip). Antibodies against endogenous NKX2.2 did not function well in our initial experiments. Therefore, we used A673 Ewing's cells in which endogenous NKX2.2 was knocked down using the NKX-RNAi construct, and a 3xFLAG-tagged NKX2.2 was subsequently expressed. These cells represent our NKX2.2 &#x0201c;knockdown/rescue&#x0201d; condition, which was fully functional with respect to oncogenic transformation in Ewing's sarcoma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001965-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Cross-linked DNA/protein complexes were immunoprecipitated using an anti-FLAG antibody and recovered DNA was hybridized to Agilent 244k promoter microarrays. Using this approach, we identified approximately 600 genes that were directly bound by NKX2.2 (data not shown). GSEA comparison of directly bound targets with the NKX2.2 knockdown/rescue microarray dataset revealed a statistically significant enrichment of NKX2.2 bound targets with NKX2.2 repressed genes (NES&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;&#x02212;1.4; p&#x0003c;0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001965-g005">Figure 5F</xref>). These data suggest that NKX2.2 represses gene expression through direct binding to promoters and recruitment of TLE and HDAC family members in the majority of its targets. It should be noted that in some cases NKX2.2 could function by competing with the recruitment of positively-regulating transcription factors. Additional work at specific promoters will be required to evaluate this possibility.</p><p>Transcriptional repression is central to the pathogenesis of several types of cancers, including both acute myelogenous leukemias (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemias (ALL). For example, acute promyelocytic leukemia (APML), is associated with the t(15;17)(q24;q21) encoding the PML-RAR&#x003b1; fusion product. PML-RAR&#x003b1; acts as a transcriptional repressor to block retinoic acid responsive genes in the absence of ligand due to its interaction with HDACs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001965-Minucci1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. All-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) reverses the repressive activity of PML-RAR&#x003b1;, and thereby alters its oncogenic function, making it an important therapeutic agent for patients with APML. The addition of HDAC inhibitors in combination with ATRA treatment has shown increased efficacy in preclinical models of this disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001965-Grignani1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001965-Guidez1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, transcriptional repressors are an important therapeutic target in hematologic malignancies.</p><p>In contrast, evidence from solid tumor development has largely pointed to an important role for transcriptional activation. For example, the PAX3/FKHR fusion in alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, the TLS/CHOP fusion in myxoid liposarcoma, and the EWS/ATF1 fusion in clear cell sarcoma have all been shown to function as transcriptional activators <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001965-Prasad1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001965-Sublett1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001965-Fujimura1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. Similarly, evidence has also suggested that EWS/FLI functions as a transcriptional activator, and that this is required for its role in oncogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001965-May2">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001965-Lessnick1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. While EWS/FLI-mediated transcriptional activation may be important, our data suggest that transcriptional repression plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of Ewing's sarcoma. This repression is attributable, in part, to the EWS/FLI upregulated target NKX2.2, and is mediated through HDACs. Reversal of the NKX2.2 signature by vorinostat provides correlative data for a role of the protein in the blockade of oncogenic transformation by the drug. These data complement our mechanistic work and support a role for NKX2.2-mediated transcriptional repression in Ewing's sarcoma oncogenesis.</p><p>In summary, the EWS/FLI target protein, NKX2.2, functions as a transcriptional repressor in Ewing's sarcoma. This function is both necessary, and sufficient, for its participation in the oncogenic phenotype of the disease. This is an important first step in understanding the transcriptional hierarchy induced by EWS/FLI. For example, NKX2.2 mediates a highly significant portion of the EWS/FLI downregulated signature. However, the absolute number of genes repressed by NKX2.2 is small, consisting of approximately 2&#x00025; of the EWS/FLI repressed signature. This suggests that additional EWS/FLI targets, or EWS/FLI itself, contribute to the remaining portion of the signature. In addition, the role of HDACs as effectors of transcriptional repression in Ewing's sarcoma suggests that HDAC inhibitors might be a useful therapeutic option for patients with this devastating cancer of children and young adults.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s3"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Constructs and retroviruses</title><p>NKX-RNAi, luc-RNAi, and ERG-RNAi were previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001965-Smith1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>.
