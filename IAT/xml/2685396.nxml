Marlin-1 is highly conserved in vertebrates and its structure consists of three coiled-coil domains containing two leucine zippers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. A 200 aminoacid region in the C-terminus is responsible for binding GABA<sub>B1 </sub>and Jaks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. A central region binds RNA <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] and the N-terminus interacts with microtubules and kinesin-I [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The N-terminus is also involved in the stabilization of the microtubular network in cell lines, specifically opposing the destabilizing effect of Nocodazole [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Marlin-1 co-sediments with a cytoskeleton complex in the brain and moves in a microtubule-dependent manner in dendrites of hippocampal neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Five splice variants for Marlin-1 (a-e) have been described recently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Expression of Marlin-1a has been reported preferentially in the central nervous system (CNS), but additional expression has been observed in lymphoid cells, testis and skeletal muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Marlin-1b, 1c and 1d are predominantly expressed in the brain, whereas Marlin-1e is not present in the brain but is abundant in lung and liver.</p><p>Marlin-1 has been associated with carotid body morphology and function, and Crohn's disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Furthermore, altered expression of Marlin-1 has been reported in two genetic conditions linked to autism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. However, despite its potential role in this severe neurological pathology the specific cellular and subcellular localization in the CNS has not been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. In addition, it has been suggested that association to the microtubule cytoskeleton constitutes a central aspect of Marlin-1 function, but a high resolution microscopic analysis of the association of Marlin-1 and microtubules in the brain is missing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Here we describe the cellular and subcellular localization of Marlin-1 in the brain. We study the cellular localization of Marlin-1 in the rodent brain via immunohistochemistry and the subcellular localization of Marlin-1 in the adult rat hippocampus using pre-embedding electron microscopy (EM). We complement these studies with immunofluorescence in hippocampal neurons. Our results demonstrate that Marlin-1 is abundant in restricted regions of the brain including olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex, hippocampus, medulla, pons and cerebellum. Marlin-1 is a neuronal specific protein present in dendrites and axons, but only occasionally in dendritic spines. Marlin-1 is associated to microtubules in neurites and to a lesser extent to intracellular organelles in the cell body. It is also associated to euchromatin in the nucleus. These observations are consistent with the proposed function of Marlin-1 relative to transport and the cytoskeleton.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Marlin-1 is expressed in restricted regions of the CNS</title><p>To determine the cellular distribution of Marlin-1 in the CNS brain slices were prepared from adult mouse and subject to immunohistochemistry using pre-immune or Marlin-1 antibodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. No specific staining was detected with pre-immune antibodies (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref> and inset). On the contrary, a specific labeling was observed with Marlin-1 antibodies (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Although at low magnification the distribution of the immunostaining appeared relatively uniform, higher magnification images demonstrated that the protein localized to specific cellular groups in discrete areas of the brain (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C&#x02013;M</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Prevalent regions included the olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex, hippocampus, hipothalamus, preoptic area, medulla and cerebellum.

Marlin-1 was not observed in neurons of the external or internal plexiform layer of the olfactory bulb. In the cerebral cortex Marlin-1 was present in all cortical layers, but mostly in layers III and IV (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>). The staining was less prominent in other brain areas such as the thalamus (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F</xref>). In the hippocampus, cells showed high expression of Marlin-1 in CA1, CA2 and CA3 pyramidal cell layers, being less prominent in the granular cell layer of the dentate gyrus (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1G&#x02013;J</xref>). Expression was moderate in the pons region and high in several nuclei of the medulla including in the area of the medial vestibular nucleus and the gigantocellular reticular nucleus (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1K</xref> and inset). In the cerebellum Marlin-1 was highly expressed in Purkinje cells (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1L</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1M</xref>). The glomerular and molecular layers of the cerebellum showed lower levels of Marlin-1. The staining for Marlin-1 was intense in the soma in all the areas analyzed, but neurites were also labeled. This was particularly evident in the medulla and Purkinje cells of the cerebellum (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1K, L</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1M</xref> arrowheads).</p></sec><sec><title>Marlin-1 is a neuronal specific protein</title><p>Although initially described in hippocampal neurons, many aspects of the cellular and subcellular localization of Marlin-1 using light and electron microscopy remain unknown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Importantly, the suitability of the hippocampus and its cultured neurons to evaluate the localization of Marlin-1 is supported by the abundant expression of the transcript and protein for Marlin-1 in this brain area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>First, to examine the distribution of Marlin-1 in specific cellular types we carried out a light microscopy analysis in primary hippocampal cultures. Marlin-1 was only observed in neuronal cell types and was absent from glia as indicated co-labeling with GFAP, a specific glial marker (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A&#x02013;C</xref>, GFAP-positive, arrow; Marlin-1-positive/GFAP-negative, arrowhead). To determine the identity of neurons that expressed Marlin-1 we used GAD, an established marker for GABAergic interneurons. Marlin-1 was present in GAD-positive and GAD-negative neurons (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D&#x02013;F</xref>, GAD-positive, arrow; GAD-negative, arrowheads). Combined, these results indicate that Marlin-1 is a neuronal specific protein expressed in interneurons and pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Cellular distribution of Marlin-1 in hippocampal cultures</bold>.

Marlin-1 was present in dendrites and axons of stage 3 and 5 hippocampal neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In dendrites, Marlin-1 was prominent in the proximal region and gradually diminished towards distal neurites resembling MAP2 (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A&#x02013;F</xref>). In axons, the majority of neurons displayed a strong immunoreactivity in the axon initial segment that gradually decreased distally (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3G&#x02013;L</xref>, arrowheads). Occasionally, a weaker staining for Marlin-1 was observed in distal portions of the axon (not shown). Similar results were obtained at different developmental stages (2&#x02013;21 div, not shown). These results conclusively demonstrate that Marlin-1 is a neuronal specific protein with dendritic and limited axonal distribution.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Subcellular distribution of Marlin-1 in neurites of hippocampal neurons</bold>.

Marlin-1 localized within the cell body and along the axis of neurites. Some apposition between Piccolo-positive structures and Marlin-1 was visible in dendrites, but the majority of the protein did not colocalize with Piccolo. In contrast, it distributed to a more central area of the dendritic shaft (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A&#x02013;C</xref> and higher magnification D-F. Neurite axis, arrows; synapses, arrowheads). To confirm these findings the synaptic distribution of Marlin-1 was examined at the EM level using pre-embedding immunogold labeling in the CA1 region of hippocampus. In agreement with our light microscopy analysis Marlin-1 was frequently present in the cytoplasm of dendrites (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4G&#x02013;J</xref>, arrows), but only occasionally associated to dendritic spines (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4J</xref>, crossed arrow).

Marlin-1 was present in many thick and thin dendritic profiles that were often traced back to their origin in pyramidal and nonpyramidal cells. In spine bearing dendrites of pyramidal cells, cytoplasmic labeling was present in thick trunks (&#x0003e;0.5 &#x003bc;m diameter) of apical and basal dendrites, and in thin branches (&#x0003c;0.5 &#x003bc;m diameter) (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A&#x02013;C</xref>, and Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4G&#x02013;J</xref>). More importantly, in dendritic shafts Marlin-1 was frequently associated to electron dense structures corresponding to microtubules (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5A&#x02013;C</xref>, arrows). We next evaluated the subcellular localization of Marlin-1 relative to secretory organelles in neuronal somata. In the cytoplasm Marlin-1 was not a major component of the stacked cisternae of the Golgi apparatus or the rough ER, but was observed in the vicinity of these secretory organelles and other intracellular membranes (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D&#x02013;F</xref>, crossed arrows). The physical proximity between a fraction of Marlin-1 and the ER and Golgi apparatus was also observed by fluorescent microscopy in mature hippocampal neurons [see Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>]. Finally, a proportion of Marlin-1 appeared in the nucleus, preferentially associated with euchromatin and the nuclear membrane. Clusters of immunoparticles for Marlin-1 were frequently observed in these regions (Figs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5G&#x02013;I</xref>, arrowheads). Importantly, no specific staining was observed in any of the regions mentioned when a pre-immune serum was used (not shown).</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Subcellular localization of Marlin-1 in the CA1 region of the hippocampus relative to microtubules, secretory organelles and the nucleus</bold>.

The association of Marlin-1 to microtubules has been reported previously in Jurkat cells, neurons and testis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In addition, the interaction with molecular motors has been demonstrated in brain extracts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Interestingly, we have been unable to obtain a reproducible association of Marlin-1 with microtubules in COS-7 cells, an epithelial fibroblast-like cell line (not shown). This difference has not been explained satisfactorily, but it is possible that Marlin-1 interacts with a specific tubulin isotype not present in COS-7 cells, such as &#x003b2;(III)-tubulin. Thus, the precise mechanism and molecular specificity of Marlin-1 and microtubule binding awaits clarification.</p><p>We occasionally observe the accumulation of Marlin-1 in a perinuclear region in hippocampal neurons (not shown) and our EM analysis indicates that a proportion of endogenous Marlin-1 associates to the rough ER and Golgi in the brain. Recently, two proteins belonging to the Marlin-1 family, namely NECC1 and NECC2, have been identified in frogs (<italic>Rana ridibunda</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. These correspond to the mammalian orthologs Jamip2 and Jamip3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Jamip2 (NECC1) and Jamip3 (NECC2) are abundant in the brain, are structurally similar to Marlin-1 and consist on a series of long coiled-coil domains interspersed with non-coiled-coil stretches. Contrary to Marlin-1 they contain a transmembrane domain at their C-termini [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Cruz-Garcia et al. (2007) suggest that these proteins may be considered part of the diverse family of Golgin tethering factors. Golgins organize the Golgi apparatus and regulate membrane trafficking through their interaction with the cytoskeleton and cytoskeletal motors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Jamip2-NECC1 and Jamip3-NECC2 colocalize partially with the Golgi apparatus upon over-expression in HEK-293 cells, but their distribution differs from GM130, a marker for CGN and cis Golgi stacks, and colocalization with VSVG-GFP ts045 is weak [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Nevertheless, Jamip2-NECC1/Jamip3-NECC2 and the Golgi coincide in a perinuclear region. Regarding Marlin-1 more experiments are needed to determine whether it may also be considered part of the Golgin family, but it will be of interest to further examine its role in protein trafficking in the context of its distribution relative to microtubules and secretory organelles.</p><p>A small proportion of Marlin-1 is present in dendritic spines, but not in presynaptic terminals in the hippocampus. However, the strong axonal staining observed in hippocampal neurons using immunofluorescence and the labeling of olfactory bulb glomeruli should be taken into account when characterizing the distribution of Marlin-1 in axon terminals, especially in the olfactory system.</p><p>Overall, the cellular pattern of protein expression of Marlin-1 coincides with the in situ hybridization data reported in the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. However, some discrepancies exist in restricted regions of the brain such as dentate gyrus. These differences probably reflect translational regulation, differential protein stability or preferential expression of specific splice variants.</p></sec><sec><title>A proportion of Marlin-1 is nuclear</title><p>Our EM and immunofluorescence analyses show that a proportion of Marlin-1 is nuclear. These results are consistent with nuclear localization and nuclear export signals present in the protein and support previous studies regarding the interaction of Marlin-1 with nucleic acids <italic>in vitro</italic>, in particular with single stranded RNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. It is currently unknown whether the cytoskeletal and nuclear localizations of Marlin-1 reflect two separate roles of Marlin-1 or are two aspects of a single function. Likewise, it remains to be studied whether different splice variants of Marlin-1 account for the different cellular and subcellular distribution patterns observed in the present study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The fact that the antibodies used here detect all but one of the splice variants requires this possibility to be examined promptly.</p></sec><sec><title>Functional implications of the distribution of Marlin-1</title><p>Marlin-1 was originally identified as a GABA<sub>B </sub>receptor and Jaks interacting protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Moreover, a general cytoskeletal function has appeared [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Here we have focused exclusively on the distribution of Marlin-1 to provide an unbiased analysis of the protein in the brain, and particularly in the hippocampus.</p><p>Our studies are consistent with the emerging role of Marlin-1 as an intracellular protein linking the cytoskeleton and transport in neurons and lymphocytes. In neurons, GABA<sub>B </sub>receptors have been found in association with microtubules and intracellular organelles, and their highly regulated trafficking make them ideal targets for a transport system linking secretory organelles and the cytoskeleton [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. In CD8+ T lymphocytes, the transport of secretory granules to the cell periphery and the regulation of cytotoxic activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] is also a system likely to benefit from organelle-cytoskeleton linking proteins that bind different partners through distinct modular domains.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In the present study we provide the first detailed description of the cellular and subcellular distribution of Marlin-1 in the brain. We have used immunohistochemistry to evaluate the cellular distribution of Marlin-1. We have also employed immunofluorescence and EM to examine its subcellular distribution. Marlin-1 is present exclusively in neuronal cell types. Marlin-1 positive neurons are located in several brain regions, such as olfactory bulb, hippocampus, cerebral cortex, brainstem and cerebellum. The expression of the protein is abundant in GABAergic and non GABAergic cells. It is concentrated in the shaft of dendrites and the axon initial segment but less prominent in dendritic spines. Marlin-1 is associated to the microtubule cytoskeleton, a proportion is related to membranes of secretory organelles and a significant pool is found in the neuronal nucleus. Our results will set the basis for future analyses of the functional implications of Marlin-1 in protein trafficking in neurons.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Antibodies</title><p>Antibodies directed against the N- and C-terminal domains of Marlin-1 have been reported before [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. We have previously characterized their specificity and reported adsorption controls to demonstrate their suitability for localization studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Here we have used N-terminus antibodies directed against aminoacids 1&#x02013;374 that recognize a doublet in brain and neuronal preparations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. These antibodies recognize all the splice variants of Marlin-1 except Marlin-1E [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Since Marlin-1E has not been found in the brain, our study takes into account all the relevant neuronal splice variants.
