In this work, we used the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> to study the ability of tailor-made zinc finger proteins to activate the expression of the <italic>FLO11</italic> gene, with phenotypic consequences. Two three-finger peptides were identified, recognizing sites from the 5&#x02032; UTR of the <italic>FLO11</italic> gene with nanomolar DNA-binding affinity. The three-finger domains and their combined six-finger motif, recognizing an 18-bp site, were fused to the activation domain of VP16 or VP64. These transcription factor constructs retained their DNA-binding ability, with the six-finger ones being the highest in affinity. However, when expressed in haploid yeast cells, only one three-finger recombinant transcription factor was able to activate the expression of <italic>FLO11</italic> efficiently. Unlike in the wild-type, cells with such transcriptional activation displayed invasive growth and biofilm formation, without any requirement for glucose depletion. The VP16 and VP64 domains appeared to act equally well in the activation of <italic>FLO11</italic> expression, with comparable effects in phenotypic alteration. We conclude that the functional activity of tailor-made transcription factors in cells is not easily predicted by the in vitro DNA-binding activity.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The Cys<sub>2</sub>His<sub>2</sub> zinc finger (ZF) domain, initially discovered in TFIIIA from <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000746-Brown1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000746-Miller1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, is the most common DNA-binding (DB) motif in eukaryotes, and the second most frequently-encoded protein domain in the human proteome, being found in approximately 2&#x00025; of all our proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000746-Tupler1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000746-Lander1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>.

The combined six-finger (6F) peptides (derived by linking the 3F peptides) recognize an 18-bp site with a 2-bp gap. Recombinant TFs (rTFs) were made by fusing these peptides to the activation domain (AD) VP16, from herpes simplex virus, or its derivative VP64. Despite finding several candidates that work in vitro, we found that only one peptide can competently activate the expression of <italic>FLO11</italic> in haploid yeast cells. The activation of <italic>FLO11</italic> expression is not dependent on carbon source depletion and can advance invasive growth of cells in semi-solid medium, biofilm formation of cells in liquid culture, and tighter adhesion of cells to polysterene. The inability of the rest of rTFs to efficiently activate <italic>FLO11</italic> expression is presumably due to exclusion from the binding site by endogenous factors binding to the site for the rTFs. Our results suggest that artificial TFs based on ZFs can be used as a general gene-switch tool for modulating the expression of specific genes that render specific selectable phenotypic alterations.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Phage clones expressing zinc fingers are selected against pre-determined FLO11 DNA target sites</title><p>To select phage clones expressing 3F peptides, a phage display approach was adopted.

These observations indicated that additional domains fused to the C-terminus of ZFs, including nuclear localization signal and AD, did not change the binding affinity of the proteins tested. In addition, the binding affinity of the rTF with a 6F DBD was approximately 10-fold stronger to those of the rTFs with 3Fs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000746-g002">Figure 2</xref>).

By contrast, only one out of three clones that has been selected by phage display with the bipartite approach functioned here, even though the initial selected clones against each &#x0201c;half site&#x0201d; had <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> values equal to or greater than that of Zif268 to its cognate site. This is presumably due to loss of tighter DB affinity against the &#x0201c;full sites&#x0201d; due to incompatibilities within the recombined clones. The results indicate that at least several sites should be screened in parallel for a successful result with bipartite selection. Significantly, all the functional ZF DBDs obtained, either selected directly from Lib12 or via recombination after bipartite selection, have <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> values in the nanomolar range, similar to those of naturally existing TFs such as Sp1 and Zif268.</p><p>Notably, the rTFs with ZF DBDs and ADs, together with the short peptides of nuclear localization signal and epitope tag, maintained their DB affinity relative to proteins with isolated DBDs. It should also be emphasised that the ADs of either VP16 or VP64 played no apparent role in the affinity of DNA-binding of the rTFs. Similarly-structured engineered rTFs have also been shown to keep their DB affinity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000746-Papworth1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000746-Reynolds1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, therefore this can be used as a general structure for engineering rTFs. Moreover, the rTFs carrying the 6F DB peptide (recognizing 18-bp with 2-bp gap) had an affinity greater than those carrying individual 3F peptides, although such increase in DB affinity is only moderate, at about 10-fold. The linker we adopted was a canonical type of linker with an insertion of 7 residues TG(GGGSGGS)ERP that should allow flexibility. This affinity increase is well below that reported by Kim and Pabo using similar linkers: they report an enhancement of binding affinity of 6,000-fold, albeit using a different method to measure the affinities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000746-Kim1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. The increase in affinity is also less than the one with a structural linker, which has been reported as being over 300-fold tighter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000746-Moore2">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>. This may well be the effect of linker peptide being perhaps not as flexible as expected, thus preventing the optimal proximity of the ZF resides to their contacting bases. It may also have arisen from the specific geometry of the interaction between ZF residues and the bases of the DNA-binding sites.</p><p>With respect to the ability of rTFs to activate the expression of <italic>FLO11</italic>, cells carrying rTFs with a DBD of 3F 3ZfFLO11/F2 (and an AD of either VP16 or VP64) appeared to be the most potent in activating expression of <italic>FLO11</italic>, resulting in a significantly altered phenotype. This new phenotype was easily distinguished from the control in the qualitative assay of invasive growth. In addition, such phenotypic change exhibited 2-fold enhancement of induction in a quantitative adhesion assay. The induction of adhesion could be maintained at the same level for up to 3 hrs in the presence of rTFs (data not shown), indicating that the maintenance of adhesion-induction is indeed dependent on the expression of the rTFs. By contrast, cells carrying rTFs with the DBD of 3F 3ZfFLO11/F1 (that was similar in DB affinity with 3ZfFLO11/F2, as determined by gel-shift assays) lacked any significant ability to activate the expression of <italic>FLO11</italic>. 3ZfFLO11/F1 behaved nearly the same as the control, with no apparent alteration in phenotype. Furthermore, the six finger 6ZfFLO11/F2-F1 that was approximately 10-fold tighter than 3ZfFLO11/F2 in DB affinity, also showed only a limited capacity in activating the expression of <italic>FLO11</italic>. The 6F rTF was in fact constructed to create a more potent transcriptional activator from the 3F components, due to a combination of a slower off-rate, an extended half-life, and a better binding affinity when bound with their target DNA sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000746-Kim1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000746-Beerli3">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>. These effects should permit more efficient competition with the naturally occurring transcription factors, and yet 6ZfFLO11/F2-F1 works less well than 3ZfFLO11/F2. Since both 3ZfFLO11/F1 and 6ZfFLO11/F2-F1 target the common DNA site of TFLO11/F1, but are ineffective for <italic>FLO11</italic> transcriptional activation, there may be occlusion of the TFLO11/F1 site by endogenous TFs. Indeed, the TFLO11/F1 site is adjacent to the enhancer element of TEA/ATT with consensus sequence CATTCPy (TCS), that is bound by the endogenous TF Tec1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000746-Kohler1">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref>. A recent study has shown that expression of filamentation genes such as <italic>FLO11</italic> is regulated by Tec1 binding on TCS, which is inhibited by Dig1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000746-Chou1">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref>. In non-filamentation-inducing conditions, binding of TCS is regulated by a complex of Tec1/Ste12/Dig1. This complex may be sufficient to exclude rTFs with the DBD of 3ZfFLO11/F1 from binding to TFLO11/F1, as it is adjacent to the TCS site. The rTFs with 6ZfFLO11/F2-F1, binding to TFLO11/F1-F2, may also be severely disrupted but still retain a slightly better ability than those with 3ZfFLO11/F1 alone, to activate the expression of <italic>FLO11</italic>. These results are different to those in a previous study, in which a 6F KOX repressor is able to exclude endogenous TFs from the HIV-1 5&#x02032; promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000746-Reynolds1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Indeed, we cannot completely rule out the possibility that other sites in the genome bind with 3ZfFLO11/F1 or 6ZfFLO11/F2-F1 and thereby titer out their binding with TFLO11/F1 or TFLO11/F1-F2. However, it is also possible that the functional activity of rTFs in cells is determined by DNA accessibility in addition to affinity for the target site.</p><p>It appeared that cells expressing rTFs with VP64 activated the expression of <italic>FLO11</italic> in a level similar to those with VP16. Indeed, a quantitative assay for cell aggregation revealed that rTFs with VP64 were only 1.03- to 1.07-fold more effective in generating a signal than those with VP16 (0.1&#x0003c;p&#x0003c;0.53), which is statistically insignificant. Therefore while VP64 may be a better transcriptional activator than VP16, this results in a very limited difference in potency <italic>in vivo</italic>. The differences in fold-of-induction of phenotypic alteration should be in direct association with the up-regulation of the <italic>FLO11</italic>. The limited improvement in potency of VP64 over VP16 in rTFs is not as striking as in a previous report, in which an erbB-2 promoter-luciferase reporter system was targeted by transcriptional activators with ADs of either VP16 or VP64, resulting in a 5-fold increase in potency with VP64 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000746-Beerli3">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>. To the best of our knowledge, no report has addressed the issue of the potency between VP16 and VP64 by comparing their ability to activate endogenous genes. Whether the reduced effect on transcriptional activation in targeting an endogenous gene, compared with a reporter system, is a general phenomenon or whether the effect is target gene-specific remains to be studied systematically. It is also of interest that although the expression of <italic>FLO11</italic> under derepressed conditions is comparable to rTFs with 3ZfFLO11/F2, the results from phenotypic assays indicated that rTFs with 3ZfFLO11/F2 enhance phenotypic alterations to a greater extent. This difference might be the result from other factors, in addition to <italic>FLO11</italic> induction under derepressed conditions, determining the outcoming phenotypes.</p><p>In this report, we have shown that a customized rTF can activate the expression of an endogenous gene in yeast cells, in a sequence-specific manner. Such regulations appear to mimic the control of gene expression by naturally existing TFs, but are amenable to artificial inducible regulation.

Given that only ZF-based rTFs can act as either activators or repressors in the control of gene expression, they have certain advantages over other gene regulation technologies, such as RNAi, antisense, and ribozymes, which are limited to the inhibition of gene expression. Nonetheless, as with all other forms of gene therapy, the lack of effective delivery systems and the possibility of immunological response against the rTFs, may be the real hurdle for ZF-based transcriptional therapy. Nonetheless, ZF-based rTFs allow the regulation of expression of endogenous genes, resulting in phenotypic alterations. This opens up an opportunity in the use of ZF proteins in functional genomics.
