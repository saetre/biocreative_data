The binding of PfEMP1 molecules to human cell surface receptors mediates the adherence of infected red blood cells to human tissues. The sequences of the 60 PfEMP1 genes in each parasite genome vary greatly from parasite to parasite, yet the variant PfEMP1 proteins maintain receptor binding. Almost all parasites isolated directly from patients bind the human CD36 receptor. Of the several kinds of highly polymorphic cysteine-rich interdomain region (CIDR) domains classified by sequence, only the CIDR1&#x003b1; domains bind CD36. Here we describe the CD36-binding portion of a CIDR1&#x003b1; domain, MC179, as a bundle of three &#x003b1;-helices that are connected by a loop and three additional helices. The MC179 structure, containing seven conserved cysteines and 10 conserved hydrophobic residues, predicts similar structures for the hundreds of CIDR sequences from the many genome sequences now known. Comparison of MC179 with the CIDR domains in the genome of the <italic>P. falciparum</italic> 3D7 strain provides insights into CIDR domain structure. The CIDR1&#x003b1; three-helix bundle exhibits less than 20&#x00025; sequence identity with the three-helix bundles of Duffy-binding like (DBL) domains, but the two kinds of bundles are almost identical. Despite the enormous diversity of PfEMP1 sequences, the CIDR1&#x003b1; and DBL protein structures, taken together, predict that a PfEMP1 molecule is a polymer of three-helix bundles elaborated by a variety of connecting helices and loops. From the structures also comes the insight that DBL1&#x003b1; domains are approximately 100 residues larger and that CIDR1&#x003b1; domains are approximately 100 residues smaller than sequence alignments predict. This new understanding of PfEMP1 structure will allow the use of better-defined PfEMP1 domains for functional studies, for the design of candidate vaccines, and for understanding the molecular basis of cytoadherence.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Malaria parasites express proteins of the erythrocyte membrane protein-1 family (PfEMP1) on the surfaces of the human red blood cells that they infect. These large proteins vary in sequence extensively, yet bind to host receptors to allow infected cells to adhere to host tissues. PfEMP1 proteins help parasites evade the immune system, as the 60 PfEMP1 genes are expressed one at a time. Sequence comparisons predict that PfEMP1 molecules are modular, made up of Duffy binding-like (DBL) and cysteine-rich interdomain region (CIDR) domains. Many CIDR domains bind to the human receptor CD36. We have analyzed the structure of the CD36-binding portion, known as MC179, of a CIDR domain. The MC179 protein is composed of a bundle of three helices connected by a loop and three additional helices. Based on the structure and sequence similarities, MC179 is a good model for the hundreds of known CIDR sequences. In addition, the MC179 three-helix bundle is remarkably similar to subdomain 3 of the known DBL structures. MC179 provides insight into the relatedness of both kinds of PfEMP1 domains and predicts that the large PfEMP1 molecules are polymers of three-helix bundles and their connecting polypeptides.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cycles of exponential parasite growth inside infected red blood cells (iRBCs), followed by lysis, and immediate re-invasion of uninfected RBCs are the hallmarks of malaria caused by <italic>P. falciparum</italic>.

From comparisons with DBL domains, we concluded that Cys 51 is the single unpaired cysteine in MC179 (see below). In experiments to determine which cysteine possessed the adduct, we deleted Cys 168 by truncating twelve residues from the MC179 C-terminus, resulting in the shorter MC167 construct.

The surfaces of the <bold>a</bold>, <bold>b</bold>, and <bold>c</bold> helices are not conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000147-g003">Figure 3</xref>) and the connecting helices in CIDR1&#x003b1; sequences vary in length. Therefore, a large part of the MC179 surface is not conserved, as most of the residues making up the surface of MC179 are not conserved in other CIDR1&#x003b1; domains. We propose that much of MC179 is exposed at the surface of the PfEMP1 molecule. Of course, MC179 must be exposed at the surface to bind CD36. How much of it? Perhaps 1000 &#x000c5;<sup>2</sup> would be a minimum estimate in light of other known protein-protein interactions. MC179 has a total solvent accessible area of 10,000 &#x000c5;<sup>2</sup>. Therefore, at least 10&#x00025; of MC179 is exposed. We detected conserved patches that we attribute to the interface with the M1 subdomain of CIDR1&#x003b1; and to potential CD36 binding (see below). We did not detect a conserved surface that might be an interface with DBL domains, for instance, DBL1&#x003b1; or DBL2, although the M1 portion may provide a conserved contact surface with DBL1&#x003b1;. It seems likely to us that the CIDR1&#x003b1; domain has only a small surface area in contact with the DBL domains and that more than 10&#x00025; of the area of MC179 is exposed to the bloodstream. MC179 likely extends out from the PfEMP1 molecule, consistent with the proximity of the MC179 N- and C-termini to the conserved patch predicted to interface with the M1 portion.

As described above, MC179 structurally matches the DBL C-terminal three-helix subdomain, but the DBL subdomain nearer to the N-terminus is also made up of three helices that are connected like the MC179 and C-terminal DBL bundles. The sequence extents of the N-terminal and C-terminal three-helix bundles in the structurally determined DBL domains are: residues 58&#x02013;159 and 174&#x02013;282 in EBA-175 F1, residues 365&#x02013;463 and 481&#x02013;596 in EBA-175 F2, residues 64&#x02013;165 and 190&#x02013;304 in Pk&#x003b1;-DBL (PDB codes 1ZRL and 2C6J).

MC179 structurally overlays on the DBL C-terminal three-helix bundle, but does not overlay on the N-terminal bundle. However, the helices and the connections between the helices of the N-terminal bundle (h1, h2, h3) are similar to those of the C-terminal bundle: the h1 helix (dark blue), a short connecting loop (gray), the h2 helix (light blue), a longer connecting helix (yellow), and the h3 helix (red) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000147-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Like the C-terminal bundle, the N-terminal bundle contains a disulfide that connects the h2 helix at its N-terminus with the h3 helix at its C-terminus. The cysteines that compose this disulfide in each DBL domain are: Cys 88-Cys 164 in EBA-175 F1; Cys 396-Cys 471 in EBA-175 F2; Cys 99-Cys 176 in Pk&#x003b1;-DBL.

In addition, chemical cross-linking experiments indicated the presence of MC179 dimers in solution (data not shown). We conclude that MC179 has the tendency to dimerize in solution.

In the alignment, semi-conserved hydrophobic residues implied the presence of the MC179 connecting helices <bold>a</bold>, <bold>b</bold>, and <bold>c</bold>. By their sequences, all CIDR1&#x003b1; domains appear to retain approximately the first two connecting helices, the <bold>a</bold> and <bold>b</bold> helices, as predicted by alignment with the MC179 sequence, but the third connecting helix <bold>c</bold> varies greatly in length (see 3D7 CIDR1&#x003b1; alignment in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000147.s001">Figure S1</xref>). These differing CIDR1&#x003b1; sequences and lengths must result in changes in the size of the V-like opening of the CIDR1&#x003b1; domain as seen in the MC179 structure. The sequence composition and length of the three connecting helices (<bold>a</bold>, <bold>b</bold>, and <bold>c</bold>) vary even among CIDR1&#x003b1; molecules that bind CD36 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000147.s001">Figure S1</xref>). In some CIDR1&#x003b1; sequences there are two additional cysteine residues, one located about ten residues after the end of the H2 helix and the other located about ten residues before the start of the H3 helix. In the MC179 structure, these two C&#x003b1; atom positions are separated by about 8 &#x000c5;, which could be spanned by a disulfide bond. For example, PF10_0001 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000147-g007">Figure 7</xref>), PFD0630c, PFD0005w from the 3D7 strain have such cysteines.

The presence of extra cysteines in PfEMP1 DBL domains has complicated the identification of conserved cysteines. The MC179 structure will aid in the comparison of PfEMP1 DBL, non-PfEMP1 DBL, and CIDR domains.</p><p>From the current knowledge of the MC179 and DBL X-ray structures, it is clear that the C-terminal boundary of DBL1&#x003b1; domains has sometimes been predicted to be at the end of the H2 helix of the three-helix bundle, as determined from conserved residues and the number of residues between them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000147-g007">Figure 7</xref>). This is understandable since after the end of the H2 helix there is little sequence similarity among DBL domains to guide prediction. The MC179 and DBL structures show that a third helix, degenerate helix, or, conceivably, an irregular H3 structure must be present in all DBL and CIDR domains to complete the &#x0201c;bundle&#x0201d;. The structures also predict that there are at least two cysteines at the C-terminus of the third helix that make conserved bonds with Cys 41 and Cys 49 (MC179) or their homologs in the DBL domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000147-g005">Figures 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000147-g007">7A</xref>).</p><p>This need for two cysteines at the end of the DBL domain can be used to predict the C-terminus of the DBL1&#x003b1; domain and leads to the prediction of MC179-like connecting helices in DBL1&#x003b1;. For example, in the Malayan Camp sequence shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000147-g007">Figure 7A</xref> (line 8, DBL1&#x003b1; MC), if one proceeds along the DBL1&#x003b1; MC sequence from the end of the H2 helix at conserved residue Tyr 394 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000147-g007">Figure 7A</xref>, red dot), a single cysteine is encountered at residue 445, but a cluster of three cysteines is found at residue 475 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000147-g007">Figure 7A</xref>, DBL1&#x003b1; MC). Since two cysteines are required to form disulfide bonds with two conserved cysteines near the start of the H2 helix, the third helix H3 of the DBL1&#x003b1; must include the multiple cysteines around residue 475 in the sequence -Cys-Glu-Ala-Cys-Pro-Trp-Cys- (-CEACPWC-). If the DBL1&#x003b1; domain has a three-helix bundle that ends around position 475, then the length of the three-helix region is about 70&#x02013;80 residues longer than in the EBA-175 and Pk&#x003b1;-DBL domains. This leads to the prediction that the DBL1&#x003b1; domain likely has connecting helices between H2 and H3 of about the same length (70&#x02013;80 residues) as does MC179 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000147-g007">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p>The definition of a longer DBL1&#x003b1; domain affects the predicted start of the following CIDR1&#x003b1; domain. Due to the longer DBL1&#x003b1; domain, the immediately following CIDR1&#x003b1; domain and its M1 region are predicted to be 70&#x02013;80 residues shorter. This reasoning implies that the DBL1&#x003b1; C-terminal region has been included in some predictions of the CIDR1&#x003b1; domain. Locating the DBL domain C-terminal boundary in this way by finding the cysteines that end the third helix is applicable to the DBL sequence classes, &#x003b1;, &#x003b2;, &#x003b3;, &#x003b4;, &#x003b5;, and to the analysis of the semi-conserved domain pairings of DBL1&#x003b1;-CIDR1&#x003b1;, DBL2&#x003b2;-C2, and DBL2&#x003b4;-CIDR2&#x003b2; that frequently appear in PfEMP1 sequences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000147-Smith1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The DBL1&#x003b1;-CIDR1&#x003b1; domain pairing or &#x0201c;conserved head structure&#x0201d; is present at the N-terminal end of a majority of PfEMP1 molecules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000147-Su1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000147-Gardner1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>.

We counted the number of residues that connect H2 and H3 for each DBL1&#x003b1; and its associated CIDR1&#x003b1; domain and produced a list of forty-seven pairs of numbers, one pair of numbers from each PfEMP1 with a conserved head structure. Each number is the length of the connecting sequence in a DBL1&#x003b1; or a CIDR1&#x003b1; domain. The lengths in the list are correlated with a 0.58 correlation coefficient (Spearman rank-order) between them (p&#x0003c;0.0001) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000147.s004">Figure S4</xref>). This positive length correlation between DBL1&#x003b1; and CIDR1&#x003b1; implies that the connecting sequences of the DBL1&#x003b1; domains are similar in length to the CIDR1&#x003b1; connecting regions. This may simply reflect the evolutionary relatedness of the two domains, but may indicate similar binding or other function.</p><p>The H2-H3 connecting helices of DBL1&#x003b1; may extend away from the PfEMP1 molecule, as is the prediction for MC179 based on the present structural analysis. The connecting helices in MC179 extend out from the H1-H3 side of the bundle. In DBL1&#x003b1;, we predict that the connecting helices would also extend out from the H1-H3 side of the bundle. This is distinct from the H1-H2 side that interacts with the N-terminal bundle (&#x0201c;subdomain 2&#x0201d; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000147-Singh1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000147-g005">Figures 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000147-g006">6</xref>).

Second, although MC179 is the minimal portion of the MC CIDR1&#x003b1; that binds CD36, two other recombinant CIDR1&#x003b1; domains bind CD36 only after the domains are lengthened in the N-terminal direction to be longer than MC179 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000147-Miller2">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. The minimal lengthening needed to enable these two other CIDR1&#x003b1; domains to bind CD36 extended to just before the end of the DBL1&#x003b1; domains as predicted in this work. This is consistent with the boundary between the DBL1&#x003b1; and CIDR1&#x003b1; domains that does not include the DBL1&#x003b1; H3 helix in the CD36-binding CIDR1&#x003b1; domain.</p></sec><sec id="s2l"><title>The DBL&#x003b2;-C2 Domain</title><p>In addition to DBL and CIDR domains, a third type of domain, C2, is found in PfEMP1 molecules. There are nineteen C2 domains in the 3D7 genome and each is located C-terminal to a DBL&#x003b2; domain. The A4var PfEMP1, containing a typical C2 domain, is known to bind ICAM-1, an endothelial protein that is a ligand of PfEMP1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000147-Smith3">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>. When each of the A4var DBL and CIDR domains were expressed using domain boundaries based on sequence conservation, none of the expressed domains bound ICAM-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000147-Smith2">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. The PfEMP1 domain that bound ICAM-1 was identified by combining DBL2&#x003b2; with the following C2 domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000147-Smith4">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>. In subsequent studies to identify the minimal DBL2&#x003b2;-C2 domain that allowed ICAM-1 binding, the C-terminus of the C2 domain was progressively truncated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000147-Springer1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>. ICAM-1 binding was lost when a truncation removed, as would be predicted from the current work, the third helix of the three-helix bundle at the C-terminus of the DBL2&#x003b2;-C2 domain. Work with a <italic>P. falciparum</italic> parasite that binds ICAM-1 also demonstrated that both DBL2&#x003b2; and C2 domains are required for ICAM-1 binding, as neither DBL2&#x003b2; or C2 expressed alone was able to bind ICAM-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000147-Chattopadhyay1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>. From these results, we suggest that the C2 domain completes the subdomain 3 of the DBL&#x003b2; domain, by providing the connecting residues and the third helix of the three-helix bundle that has the cysteines that make disulfides to conserved cysteines in the H2 helix. That the C2 domain contains the third helix of the DBL&#x003b2; subdomain 3 has been predicted recently from homology modeling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000147-Howell1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2m"><title>PfEMP1 Is a Polymer of Three-Helix Bundles</title><p>Sequences of PfEMP1 proteins vary enormously to evade the host immune response, while maintaining their binding to endothelial receptors. Conservation of binding to CD36 in the midst of tremendous variation in CIDR1&#x003b1; sequences implies an essential role for binding in parasite survival and in disease outcome for the host. Based on the MC179 structure and the DBL structures known at present, the highly conserved helices and disulfide bonds of the three-helix motif comprise the individual domains of the molecules in the PfEMP1 and EBA families and serve as the scaffolding on which sequence variation takes place. The two helical bundles in DBL domains and the single bundle in CIDR domains imply that a PfEMP1 molecule is not only modular in domain organization, but is a polymer of helical bundles, elaborated by connecting loops and helices. These loops and helices exhibit extraordinary sequence polymorphism and may be regions exposed to the bloodstream and its antibodies. Focusing on the binding of host ligands by PfEMP1 molecules will give insights into vaccine or drug strategies that will affect cytoadherence, help elucidate the ways that the parasite adjusts the functioning of the immune system, and should provide tools to lessen the impact of malaria in endemic areas of the world.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s3"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s3a"><title>MC179 Protein Expression and Crystallization</title><p>MC179 (residues 576&#x02013;754 of GenBank U27338) and MC167 (residues 576&#x02013;742) expression plasmids were transformed into BL21 DE3-(RIL) cells, grown to an OD<sub>600</sub> of &#x0223c;1, and induced with IPTG to produce insoluble protein (inclusion bodies).
