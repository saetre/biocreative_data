The resumption of nuclear maturation in the oocyte from the prophase stage is characterized by germinal vesicle breakdown (GVBD). It has previously been shown that specific inhibition of cAMP degradation by PDE3 prevents the resumption of oocyte meiosis. However, no report has characterized the activity of PDE3 in the porcine oocyte, or the implication of the cAMP-PDE3 pathway in the entire nuclear maturation process. In this study, PDE3 activity in the oocyte was assessed during <italic>in vitro </italic>maturation (IVM) and the possible roles of the cAMP-PDE3 pathway in the resumption and progression of meiosis were investigated in terms of different models of oocyte maturation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Cyclic AMP-degrading PDE activity was detected in the cumulus-oocyte complex (COC) and was partially inhibited by a specific PDE3 inhibitor, cilostamide. When measured only in the denuded oocyte, PDE activity was almost completely inhibited by cilostamide, suggesting that cAMP-PDE3 activity is the major cAMP-PDE in porcine oocytes. PDE3A mRNA was detected by RT-PCR. PDE3 activity did not vary significantly during the early hours of IVM, but a maximum was observed at 13 hours. In cumulus-oocyte complexes, meiosis resumed after 20.81 hours of culture. PDE3 inhibition no longer maintained meiotic arrest if sustained beyond 17.65 hours of IVM, 3 hours prior to resumption of meiosis. Thereafter, PDE3 inhibition progressively lost its efficacy in GVBD. When the protein phosphatase 1 and 2A inhibitor okadaic acid was continuously or transiently (3 hours) present during IVM, meiosis resumed prematurely; PDE3 inhibition was unable to prevent GVBD. However, PDE3 inhibition in COC treated with OA for 3 hours significantly delayed meiosis at the intermediate stage.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The present investigation has demonstrated that PDE3A is the major cAMP-degrading PDE in the oocyte. It regulates the resumption of meiosis until 3 hours prior to GVBD and transiently affects meiotic progression.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Oogonia entering meiosis progress to the diplotene stage of the first meiotic prophase, at which they display a characteristic nucleus commonly known as the germinal vesicle (GV). Oocytes arrested at the GV stage, prophase I of meiosis, enter a growth phase during which the follicle differentiates from the primary to the preovulatory stage. Oocytes acquire the capacity to resume meiosis during this period and rely on 3'5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) to prevent premature resumption. Cyclic AMP is produced in the somatic granulosa cells and transferred through gap-junction channels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Recent findings have shown that cAMP-producing capacity is also important in maintaining the prophase I-arrested state in oocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Cyclic AMP activates the cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) by binding to the two regulatory subunits, liberating the two active catalytic subunits. High concentrations of cAMP and correspondingly high PKA activity within the oocyte prevent the resumption of meiosis, as shown using cAMP analogues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], adenylyl cyclase activators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and invasive adenylyl cyclase treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Microinjection of Xenopus oocytes with the catalytic subunit of PKA also maintains them in the GV stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. However, the PKA-mediated mechanism that maintains meiotic arrest is not fully understood, although interesting advances have recently been made on possible PKA targets in mouse oocytes, such as CDC25B phosphatase and Wee1B kinase, two cell cycle regulators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Cyclic AMP is degraded by members of the phosphodiesterase (PDE) family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. PDEs are important regulators of ovarian physiology. During the past few years, PDE3 family-specific inhibitors (e.g. cilostamide, milrinone, Org 9935) have been shown to block the resumption of meiosis efficiently in murine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], rat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], bovine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], porcine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], macaque [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] and human [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] oocytes. PDE3A- and PDE4D-null female mice respectively show infertility and impaired fertility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Interestingly, PDE3A-deficient mice ovulate fully-grown oocytes, but they fail to resume meiosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. In rat oocytes, a cAMP-degrading activity sensitive to cilostamide (PDE3-specific) is increased 2-fold prior to resumption of meiosis, strongly suggesting that cAMP degradation is actively regulated in the oocyte and that regulation of PDE3A is part of the mechanism controlling resumption of meiosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>Nuclear maturation in the oocyte and rupture of the follicle are triggered by an ovulatory surge of gonadotropins <italic>in vivo</italic>. The latter is characterized by breakdown of the germinal vesicle (GVBD). GVBD is correlated with an increased activity of M phase-promoting factor (MPF). MPF is essential for GVBD, chromosome condensation, formation of microtubules around the condensed chromosomes and their organization into a bipolar structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The complete molecular pathways linking the endocrine cues to the first activation of MPF in the oocyte during nuclear maturation are unclear. However, it is known that gonadotropins trigger multiple phosphorylation cascades and second messenger signalling pathways in the somatic compartment of the ovarian follicle, and these are critical for the correct timing of oocyte maturation. Simultaneously with activation of the MPF, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activates phosphorylation in the oocyte and is believed to be implicated in chromosome condensation and microtubule organisation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. After its initial increase, MPF activity stays high until metaphase I before decreasing prior to homologous chromosome segregation and extrusion of the first polar body [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. A second increase in MPF activity maintains metaphase II prior to sperm penetration. Although this second activation is known to depend on factors such as cyclin B synthesis, presence of the nucleus and MAPK activity, the precise implication of the PDE3A/cAMP/PKA pathway remains unknown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Our laboratory has recently described physiological evidence showing the pivotal role of cAMP and its modulation by PDE3 in regulating the resumption of meiosis in porcine oocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Since no study has reported the progression of PDE3 activity during porcine oocyte nuclear maturation, the goal of the present study was to measure PDE3 activity in the oocyte during <italic>in vitro </italic>maturation (IVM) and to characterize the effect of PDE3 inhibition on different steps of nuclear maturation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Contributions of different cAMP-degrading PDEs in the oocyte</title><p>The PDE assay was optimized for porcine COC. Increasing numbers of COC were used to measure cAMP hydrolysis. The hydrolytic activity was linearly related to the number of COC and 10 COC or denuded oocytes were used (data not shown). In experiment 1, cAMP-degrading PDE3 activity was measured in cumulus-oocyte complexes (COC) after recovery from the ovary with or without PDE inhibitors. The total cAMP-PDE activity in porcine COC was 10.98 &#x000b1; 0.99 fmol cAMP degraded/min/COC, and this activity was decreased by non-specific and family-specific PDE inhibitors. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref> shows that 66% of the cAMP-degrading PDE activity is inhibited by the non-specific inhibitor 3-isobutyl-methylxanthine (IBMX), while 19% and 7% inhibition are achieved, respectively, by PDE3-specific (cilostamide) and PDE4-specific (rolipram) inhibitors (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). IBMX inhibits every cAMP-PDE subtype except for PDE8. The IBMX-sensitive (PDE1, 3, 4, 7, 10 and 11), cilostamide-sensitive (PDE3) and rolipram-sensitive (PDE4) activities were calculated as described in the experimental design section and reported in figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>. The cAMP-degrading PDE activity in the oocyte was 2.57 &#x000b1; 0.57 fmol cAMP degraded/min/oocyte (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). Cyclic AMP-PDE3 activity measured in the denuded oocyte was almost equivalent to the total activity. Moreover, these two activities are similar to the cAMP-PDE3 specific activity measured in COC (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>), suggesting that PDE3 is the predominant PDE isoform in porcine oocytes. PDE3A mRNA was detected in the oocyte by RT-PCR (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). To confirm the identity of the amplification products further, they were sequenced and found to be 98.3%, 89.7%, 81.4% and 80.9% identical to published porcine, human, mouse and rat sequences, respectively.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Cyclic AMP-degrading PDE activity in the oocyte</bold>.

No statistically significant effect of either total, IBMX-sensitive or cilostamide-sensitive (PDE3) phosphodiesterase activities was observed during IVM (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).

In the previous experiments, specific PDE3 inhibitors were added at the beginning of IVM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In experiment 3, the addition of cilostamide was postponed for several hours after the beginning of IVM. The inhibitor was still efficient at controlling GVBD when added after 13 and 15 hours of IVM (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). When PDE3 inhibition with cilostamide was still further delayed there was a gradual decrease in its control of GVBD (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). A linear regression calculation showed that 50% of the COC remain in GV when PDE3 is inhibited at 17.65 hours, which is approximately 3 hours prior to GVBD (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> hours after the peak of PDE activity in the oocyte (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). As shown in figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>, most of the oocytes resumed meiosis normally under our culture conditions within a narrow window of 4 hours between 19 and 23 hours of IVM (regression analysis, 20.81 hours of IVM for 50% GVBD). This result suggests that the cAMP-PDE3 pathway actively controls maintenance of the GV stage during at least the first 15 hours of IVM. After 19 hours of cilostamide-free culture conditions, the addition of cilostamide for the last 4 hours had no significant effect on maintaining the oocytes in the GV stage (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). In addition, maximum PDE3 activity occurs at approximately 13 hours of IVM (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), which is 6 hours prior to the end of period in which PDE3 inhibition can prevent GVBD. At 19 hours, cAMP-PDE3 activity is minimal (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>), consistent with its inefficacy in controlling GVBD.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Time-dependent ability of specific PDE3 inhibitionto maintain COC in meiotic arrest</bold>.

As proposed above, the period preceding GVBD is cAMP-PDE3-sensitive. Since MPF activity during IVM in vertebrate oocytes changes biphasically before reaching the second meiotic arrest in metaphase II, experiment 4 was designed to verify whether the second MPF activation depends on cAMP-PDE3 activity. PDE3 was inhibited with cilostamide after 19 hours of IVM and meiotic maturation was assessed immediately and at 24, 30, 36 and 48 hours afterwards. Of the cilostamide-treated COC, 66.5% resumed meiosis during 19 and 24 hours of IVM (the cilostamide-insensitive group) while 33.5% remained in GV arrest (the cilostamide-sensitive group; figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). The cilostamide-insensitive oocytes reached an intermediate nuclear stage at 24 hours (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). Of this group, 40% reached the mature nuclear stage at 30 hours, equivalent to the control oocytes (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). This result suggests that oocytes that resume meiosis despite PDE3 inhibition, the cilostamide-insensitive group, reach the mature nuclear stage at a similar rate to their control counterparts and therefore are not affected by PDE3 inhibition. The significantly higher percentages of oocytes in GV arrest at 24 (P &#x0003c; 0.05) and 30 (P &#x0003c; 0.001) hours compared to control oocytes reveal that cilostamide treatment transiently maintained the cilostamide-sensitive oocytes in meiotic arrest (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). The significantly lower percentage of oocytes at an intermediate nuclear stage at 24 (P &#x0003c; 0.01) and 30 (P &#x0003c; 0.001) hours is the result of the delay in meiotic resumption for 30% of the oocytes (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). The transition of oocytes from intermediate to mature stage at 24 and 30 hours is not compromised, since similar percentages of treated and untreated oocytes reach the mature stage at 30 hours (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). The delay in resumption of meiosis caused by cilostamide treatment can still be observed at 36 hours in the percentage of oocytes at the mature nuclear stage (79.9 &#x000b1; 2.5% vs 94.1 &#x000b1; 3.6%, cilostamide-treated vs control, figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>). However, oocytes under both treatments have completed meiotic maturation by 48 hours, showing that the effect of late PDE3-specific inhibition on resumption and progression of meiosis is transient and fully reversible. These results suggest that PDE3 inhibition affects GVBD under normal IVM conditions, but without affecting the progression of meiosis after its resumption until metaphase II arrest.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Effect of specific PDE3 inhibitor, cilostamide, on oocyte maturation</bold>.

A transient OA exposure (3 hours) triggered a rapid loss of GV stage oocytes after 12 hours of IVM (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9B</xref>) and a significantly higher rate of mature stage oocytes after 24 hours of IVM compared to the control group (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9F</xref>).

Four lines of evidence support this conclusion: (1) cilostamide-sensitive cAMP-PDE activity in the oocyte represents the main cAMP-PDE activity; (2) PDE3A mRNA was detected in oocyte cDNA by RT-PCR; (3) PDE3 inhibition after 15 hours of IVM still prevents the resumption of meiosis; (4) PDE3 inhibition delays nuclear maturation in OA-treated oocytes.</p><p>Total and cilostamide-sensitive (PDE3) PDE activities in porcine COC and denuded oocytes freshly recovered from the ovary (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>) were about the same as reported for mouse and rat oocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Furthermore, PDE3 is the predominant PDE activity in the oocyte (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>), as reported for rodents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. This result is also consistent with the presence of PDE3A protein detected by Western blotting in porcine oocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. PDE3A messenger RNA was detected in the oocyte by in situ hybridization in rat and by RT-PCR in mouse and these findings are consistent with the presence of PDE3A mRNA in porcine oocyte (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. The reported levels of cAMP during IVM range from 2 to 10 fmol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], whereas the level of cAMP-degrading activity in denuded porcine oocytes reported in this study is around 2.5 fmol of cAMP degraded per minute per oocyte throughout IVM (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). These results suggest that porcine oocytes replenish their cAMP content approximately every minute. Under our culture conditions, despite the maximum at 13 hours, total and cilostamide-sensitive (PDE3) phosphodiesterase activities were not statistically different during IVM (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). One explanation could be that the timing of GVBD is regulated by multiple cAMP-generating mechanisms. The modulation of cAMP level in the oocyte involves both the permeability of the gap-junctions and adenylyl cyclase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. In addition, the present results do not exclude a possible modulation of PDE3A activity by phosphorylation, which would be difficult to measure because highly synchronized GVBD oocytes would be needed. In the rat, a clear increase of PDE3A activity occurs 30 minutes prior to GVBD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. In the pig, the present study shows a peak in cAMP-PDE3 activity 8 hours before GVBD and a loss of the capacity of a PDE3-specific inhibitor to prevent the resumption of meiosis 3 hours before GVBD. Control of oocyte PDE activity has been reported in Xenopus, where microinjection of constitutively active PKB has been shown to increase activity and the GVBD rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Implication of PKB in the modulation of PDE activity remains a possible mechanism for the resumption of meiosis. From the 6 putative PKA and PKB serine phosphorylation sites in the N-terminus of the murine PDE3A protein sequence (NM_018779.1) described by Shitzukawa and coworkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], 5 are present in rat (NM_017337.1), pig (NM_213736.1) and human (NM_000921.3). In the other gene of the same family, PDE3B, at least two of these sites are conserved between rodents and human, and serine-302 is reportedly targeted by PKA and PKB <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. PDE3 has also been reported to be activated by partially purified MAPK and PKB in rat hepatocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. PKB activation prior to GVBD has never been shown in pig oocytes.</p><p>Because cAMP is probably involved in controlling re-entry into the cell cycle in oocytes, the next step was to investigate the role of cAMP in meiotic progression. It was confirmed that OA treatment overcame PDE3-specific inhibition, suggesting that PP1/2A inhibition activates signalling molecules downstream of cAMP-PDE3 in the pig oocyte (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>). This hypothesis is supported by previous reports showing that IBMX-arrested or milrinone (PDE3 inhibitor)-arrested mouse oocytes resume meiosis when PP1/2A is inhibited with OA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. In the latter study, PDE3 inhibition of OA-treated oocytes delayed GVBD and reduced MPF activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Interestingly, when using a spontaneous denuded oocyte maturation model, PDE3 inhibition of 3 hours OA-treated oocytes result in higher rates of intermediate stage oocyte compared to OA-treated oocytes alone after 48 hours of IVM (data not shown). These results support our findings, showing that PDE3 inhibition affects meiotic progression in OA-treated oocytes probably by delaying the decrease of MPF activity that allows nuclear maturation to be completed (figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>).</p><p>In vertebrates, the direct MPF regulators CDC25B and Myt1 are candidate targets for PP1/2A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. In fission and budding yeasts, a specific form of PP2A (PP2A-&#x003c0;) directly protects centromeric cohesins from phosphorylation and cleavage, preventing premature sister chromatin separation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. The cohesion of centromeres in sister chromatids during metaphase I is of critical importance. In the present study, fifty percent of oocytes remained at the intermediate stage after 36 and 48 hours of IVM (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9F</xref>), suggesting that inhibition of PP1/2A with OA affects the segregation machinery in a way that impairs homologous chromosome segregation without causing complete meiotic spindle dissolution (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). Similarly, transient PP1/2A inhibition with a relatively high dose of OA (1.24 &#x003bc;M) compromised anaphase initiation and stopped meiosis in metaphase I in mouse oocytes, while low doses (0.124 &#x003bc;M and 0.0124 &#x003bc;M) allowed normal meiosis to continue until metaphase II arrest but with high rates of chromosomal abnormalities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. In the present study, the transient OA exposure approach allowed meiosis to proceed to the mature stage. This approach was used successfully in a previous study to reduce the incidence of chromosome segregation defects and to improve the percentage of oocytes reaching metaphase II compared to the continuously OA-treated group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].</p><p>Wang and coworkers have shown that PKA inhibition is one of the earliest events in progesterone-induced resumption of meiosis in Xenopus oocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Our results suggest that effective PKA inhibition occurs late after the start of IVM, since stimulation of the cAMP/PKA pathway by PDE3 inhibition after 15 hours of IVM prevents GVBD completely (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). PDE3 inhibition after 19 hours of IVM has no effect on the completion of meiosis (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). In Xenopus, a similar experiment also demonstrated that reactivating the cAMP/PKA pathway after GVBD has no effect on the completion of meiosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. OA-stimulated oocytes react differently by being delayed at an intermediate stage in the presence of the PDE3 inhibitor (figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>). The reason for this is unclear; however, the capacity of the cumulus cells to transfer cAMP to the oocyte could explain the effect. PDE3 inhibition, combined with insufficient cAMP transfer, could prevent intracellular cAMP levels reaching a certain threshold and compromise PKA activation. The level of connexin 43 and its phosphorylation status have been shown to vary in porcine cumulus cells during IVM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Cyclic AMP has also been shown to inhibit proteasomal proteolysis in rat sertoli cells, COS-1 African monkey kidney cells and Y1 mouse adrenocortical tumour cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Interestingly, porcine oocytes stop their nuclear maturation in metaphase I when proteasomal degradation is inhibited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. It is possible that PDE3 inhibition in OA-treated oocytes leads to a rise in cAMP level sufficient to prevent proteasomal degradation and consequently delays the transition from intermediate to mature stage. The mechanism by which PDE3 inhibition maintains oocytes in the intermediate stage under OA-treated conditions will require further investigation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, the present investigation has revealed new insights into cAMP regulation during the resumption of meiosis in porcine oocytes. It has demonstrated that PDE3A is the major cAMP-degrading PDE activity and regulates meiotic resumption until 3 hours prior to GVBD. It has also demonstrated that PDE3 inhibition affects meiotic progression in OA-treated oocytes. We suggest that cAMP-PDE3A modulates meiotic resumption via a factor located upstream of PP1/2A substrates. This study highlights a distinctive characteristic of porcine oocyte nuclear maturation that makes it a valuable model for studying cAMP modulation during maturation: the very long latency period before the resumption of oocyte meiosis and the late release of the control maintained by the cAMP-PDE3 pathway over prophase arrest. Further experiments will provide a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in the control of PDE3A activity during IVM and the fundamental role of the cAMP/PKA pathway in the molecular mechanisms leading to meiotic maturation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Chemicals</title><p>Unless otherwise notified, all chemicals were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co (St. Louis, MO, USA).</p></sec><sec><title>Ovary collection</title><p>Ovaries were collected as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].

In experiment 8, the effects of PDE3 inhibition on OA-treated COC were studied throughout the IVM period. Oocytes were exposed for 3 hours to OA followed by PDE3 inhibition up to 48 hours. Samples were fixed at 12, 24, 36 or 48 hours for assessment of nuclear status.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Statistical analyses were performed using Prism 4.00 GraphPad for Windows (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA). The onsets of 50% GVBD and of 50% cilostamide efficacy were calculated using non-linear regression with a sigmoidal dose-response equation. Statistical significances of PDE activity measurements and nuclear maturation status were assessed using one-way ANOVA analysis and the Bonferroni multiple comparison <italic>post-hoc </italic>test to identify individual differences between means. Probabilities of less then 0.05 were considered statistically significant.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>GV: germinal vesicle; cAMP: 3'5'-cyclic adenosine monophosphate; PKA: cAMP-dependent protein kinase; MPF: M-phase promoting factor; PDE: phosphodiesterase; GVBD: GV breakdown; MAPK: mitogen-activated protein kinase; COC: cumulus-oocyte complex; DO: denuded oocyte; IVM: <italic>in vitro </italic>maturation; IBMX: 3-isobutyl-methylxanthine; OA: okadaic acid; PP1/2A: protein phosphatase 1/2A; Cil: cilostamide; Rol: rolipram.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>All authors participated in the design of the study.
