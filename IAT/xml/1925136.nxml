In addition, analysis of Dicer null mutants has shown that miRNAs play a role in tissue morphogenesis. Nonetheless, only a few loss-of-function phenotypes for individual miRNAs have been described to date. Here, we introduce a quick and versatile method to interfere with miRNA function during zebrafish embryonic development. Morpholino oligonucleotides targeting the mature miRNA or the miRNA precursor specifically and temporally knock down miRNAs. Morpholinos can block processing of the primary miRNA (pri-miRNA) or the pre-miRNA, and they can inhibit the activity of the mature miRNA. We used this strategy to knock down 13 miRNAs conserved between zebrafish and mammals. For most miRNAs, this does not result in visible defects, but knockdown of miR-375 causes defects in the morphology of the pancreatic islet. Although the islet is still intact at 24 hours postfertilization, in later stages the islet cells become scattered. This phenotype can be recapitulated by independent control morpholinos targeting other sequences in the miR-375 precursor, excluding off-target effects as cause of the phenotype. The aberrant formation of the endocrine pancreas, caused by miR-375 knockdown, is one of the first loss-of-function phenotypes for an individual miRNA in vertebrate development. The miRNA knockdown strategy presented here will be widely used to unravel miRNA function in zebrafish.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>The striking tissue-specific expression patterns of microRNAs (miRNAs) suggest that they play a role in tissue development. These small RNA molecules (&#x0223c;22 bases in length) are processed from long primary transcripts (pri-miRNA) and regulate gene expression at the posttranscriptional level. There are hundreds of different miRNAs, many of which are strongly conserved. Vertebrate embryonic development is most easily studied in zebrafish, but genetically disrupting miRNA genes to see which miRNA does what is technically challenging. In this study, we interfere with miRNA function during the first few days of zebrafish embryonic development by introducing specific antisense morpholino oligonucleotides (morpholinos have been used previously to interfere with the synthesis of the much larger mRNAs). We show that morpholinos targeting the miRNA precursor can block processing of the pri-miRNA or directly inhibit the activity of the mature miRNA. We also used morpholinos to study the developmental effects of miRNA knockdown. Although we did not observe gross phenotypic defects for many miRNAs, we found that zebrafish miR-375 is essential for formation of the insulin-secreting pancreatic islet. Loss of miR-375 results in dispersed islet cells by 36 hours postfertilization, representing one of the first vertebrate miRNA loss-of-function phenotypes.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>The authors show that morpholinos can be used to knock down zebrafish miRNAs, revealing that miR-375 is important for vertebrate pancreas development.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Kloosterman WP, Lagendijk AK, Ketting RF, Moulton JD, Plasterk RHA (2007) Targeted inhibition of miRNA maturation with morpholinos reveals a role for miR-375 in pancreatic islet development.

Strikingly, the brain phenotype of maternal-zygotic Dicer zebrafish can be restored by injection of miR-430, the most abundant miRNA in early zebrafish development. Despite all these studies describing functions for miRNAs in development, no vertebrate miRNA mutant has been described to date. Genetically, it is challenging to obtain mutant miRNA alleles in zebrafish, because their small size makes them less prone to mutations by mutagens, and for many miRNAs, there are multiple alleles in the genome or they reside in families of related sequence.</p><p>Temporal inhibition of miRNAs by antisense molecules provides another strategy to study miRNA function. 2&#x02032;-<italic>O</italic>-methyl oligonucleotides have been successfully used in vitro and in vivo to knock down miRNAs &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050203-b016">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050203-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;.

We injected 1 nl of 600 &#x003bc;M morpholino solution with a morpholino complementary to the mature miR-206 in one- or two-cell&#x02013;stage embryos. Subsequently, embryos were harvested at 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours postfertilization (hpf), and subjected to in situ hybridization and Northern blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050203-g001">Figure 1</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050203-g001">1</xref>B). This analysis showed that the mature miRNA signal is suppressed up to 4 d after injection of the morpholino. The knockdown effect was specific for this miRNA; parallel in situ analysis of the same embryos with a probe for miR-124 did not show any effects on expression of this miRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050203-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). Thus, miRNA detection can be specifically and efficiently suppressed during embryonic and early larval stages of zebrafish development using morpholinos antisense to the mature miRNA.</p><fig id="pbio-0050203-g001" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Morpholinos Targeting the Mature miRNA Deplete the Zebrafish Embryo of Specific miRNAs</title><p>(A) Northern blot for miR-206 in wild-type and MO miR-206&#x02013;injected embryos at 24, 48, and 72 hpf. 5S RNA serves as a loading control.</p><p>(B) In situ analysis of miR-206 and miR-124 expression in different stage embryos after injection of MO miR-206.</p><p>(C) Effect of a morpholino targeting miR-30c on a silencing assay with miR-30c and a responsive GFP sensor construct.</p><p>(D) In vivo and in vitro effects of a morpholino on the stability and RNA extraction of a synthetic miR-206 duplex. miR-205 serves as a loading control.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pbio.0050203.g001"/></fig><p>The zebrafish embryo can be used to monitor the effect of miRNAs on green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporters fused to miRNA target sites &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050203-b024">24</xref>&#x0005d;. To determine the effect of a morpholino in this assay system, we constructed a GFP reporter for miR-30c and tested it in the presence and absence of a mature miR-30c duplex. Injected miR-30c silences this GFP reporter, which is in line with previous reports using similar strategies in the embryo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050203-g001">Figure 1</xref>C) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050203-b002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050203-b020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050203-b024">24</xref>&#x0005d;. Co-injection of the miR-30c duplex and a morpholino targeting mature miR-30c rescues the reporter signal, whereas injection of a control morpholino did not reverse the silencing by miR-30c. These data indicate that a morpholino can block the activity of a mature miRNA duplex in a functional assay .</p><p>There are three possible explanations for the observed reduction in the detection signal for a miRNA that is targeted by a morpholino. First, the hybridization of a morpholino could disturb isolation of the miRNA. Second, the morpholino could destabilize the miRNA. Third, the morpholino could inhibit the maturation of the miRNA.</p><p>To examine the effect of a morpholino on the isolation of a mature miRNA, we incubated a mature miR-206 duplex and a control duplex (miR-205) with a morpholino against miR-206 in vitro. After isolation, samples were analyzed by Northern blotting for the presence of miR-206 and miR-205. We could still detect miR-206, indicating that there is no effect of the morpholino on the RNA isolation procedure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050203-g001">Figure 1</xref>D). However, when morpholino and miRNA duplex were incubated together in vitro and loaded on a denaturing gel without isolation, we observed a decrease in the signal for miR-206, indicating that the morpholino can bind to the miRNA in vitro and still does so in the denaturing gel.</p><p>Next, we wanted to know whether a morpholino could affect the stability of a mature miRNA in vivo. Therefore, we injected a mature miR-206 and a control duplex (miR-205) together with a morpholino against miR-206 in the embryo. After incubation for 8 h, RNA was isolated and subjected to Northern blot analysis to probe for injected miR-206 and injected miR-205. In contrast to the data obtained for endogenous miR-206, there was no decrease observed in the amount of injected miR-206 in the morpholino-injected embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050203-g001">Figure 1</xref>D) (endogenous miR-206 is not yet expressed at this stage).</p><p>Since these data show that there is no effect of a morpholino on miRNA isolation or stability, we conclude that morpholinos deplete the embryo of miRNAs by inhibiting miRNA maturation. If this is the case, then we expect morpholinos targeting other regions of the miRNA precursor to act as well as the morpholinos designed against the mature miRNA, and this is indeed what we find (see next section).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Morpholinos Targeting the miRNA Precursor Interfere with Primary miRNA Processing</title><p>Injection of antisense oligos in embryos might result in off-target effects. Thus, phenotypic data retrieved from antisense knockdown experiments should be treated with caution. In <italic>Drosophila,</italic> 2&#x02032;-<italic>O</italic>-methyl oligo&#x02013;mediated knockdown of embryonically expressed miRNAs caused defects that clearly differed from the phenotype of the corresponding knockout fly &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050203-b009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050203-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d;.

Because our data on morpholinos targeting the mature miRNA suggested that miRNA biogenesis might be affected, we designed morpholinos targeting the Drosha and Dicer cleavage sites of the precursor miRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050203-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). We decided to test this strategy on miR-205, since it is expressed relatively early, and there are only two, but identical, copies in the fish genome. Four different morpholinos were designed to inhibit miR-205 biogenesis: two targeting the Drosha cleavage site complementary to either the 5&#x02032; or 3&#x02032; arm of the stem, and two morpholinos similarly targeting the Dicer cleavage site (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050203-sg001">Figure S1</xref>). These morpholinos were injected under similar conditions as described for miR-206 and compared to the morpholino targeting mature miR-205. Interestingly, all five morpholinos induced complete or near-complete loss of miR-205 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050203-g002">Figure 2</xref>B).</p><fig id="pbio-0050203-g002" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Morpholinos Targeting the Precursor miRNA Interfere with miRNA Maturation</title><p>(A) Design of morpholinos targeting the precursor miRNA.</p><p>(B) Northern blot analysis of miR-205 in 30-h-old embryos injected with different morpholinos against pri-miR-205. 5S RNA serves as a loading control.</p><p>(C) Time series of miR-205 expression after injection of mature, no lap loop, and drosha star morpholinos against pri-miR-205.</p><p>(D) Northern blot analysis of miR-205 derived from embryos injected with a GFP-pri-miR-205 transcript and four different morpholinos targeting pri-miR-205.

Therefore, we tested how long the effect of the morpholinos would last. Although for this series of morpholinos the knockdown is best at 24 hpf, the effect is still significant up to 72 hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050203-g002">Figure 2</xref>C).</p><p>Next, we tested a similar series of morpholinos against the miR-30c precursor and analyzed miR-30c expression by Northern blotting (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050203-sg002">Figure S2</xref>). However, we only observed knockdown for the morpholino targeting mature miR-30c, but not for the other four morpholinos targeting the miR-30c precursor. This could be because miR-30c resides in a family of closely related species, with more sequence variability in the regions outside of the mature miRNA. The precursors of the family members might not all be targeted by these morpholinos (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050203-sg002">Figure S2</xref>). Thus, not all miRNAs are equally prone to knockdown by morpholinos that target the miRNA precursor.</p><p>To investigate the effect of morpholinos on exogenously introduced pri-miR-205, we injected mRNA derived from a GFP construct with pri-miR-205 in the 3&#x02032; UTR. Again, we could not detect mature miR-205 derived from this construct after targeting by morpholinos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050203-g002">Figure 2</xref>D). Interestingly, the miR-205 precursor also could not be detected in the embryos co-injected with morpholinos, whereas pre-miR-205 could be detected in the absence of morpholinos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050203-g002">Figure 2</xref>D). Because pri-miR-205 was cloned in the 3&#x02032; UTR of GFP, we monitored GFP fluorescence after injection of this construct. In the presence of a morpholino, GFP fluorescence increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050203-g002">Figure 2</xref>E), suggesting accumulation of the primary miRNA. Therefore, we performed reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) on 8-h-old embryos injected with GFP-pri-miR-205 and a control mRNA (luciferase) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050203-g002">Figure 2</xref>F). In the presence of a morpholino, the GFP-pri-miR-205 mRNA level is higher compared to control embryos that were not injected with morpholinos. This experiment confirms the GFP data and shows that morpholinos targeting the miRNA precursor inhibit Drosha cleavage.</p><p>Next, we tested whether processing of the pre-miRNA might also be inhibited by morpholinos. Therefore, we injected a miR-205 precursor in the one-cell&#x02013;stage embryo. Northern analysis showed that the precursor was processed into mature miRNA in the embryo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050203-g002">Figure 2</xref>G). However, co-injection of the overlap loop and non-overlapping loop morpholinos blocked processing completely. There was only a little effect of morpholinos targeting the Drosha cleavage site, probably because they only partially overlap the precursor.</p><p>A similar analysis was performed for miR-375, which is expressed in the pancreatic islet and pituitary gland &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050203-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;, and has two copies in the zebrafish genome, which differ in the regions outside the mature miRNA.</p><p>Overlap loop and loop morpholinos were designed for both miR-375&#x02013;1 and miR-375&#x02013;2, and a morpholino against the miRNA star sequence could be used to target both copies of miR-375 simultaneously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050203-g003">Figure 3</xref>A). The efficacy of all morpholinos was assessed by determining their effect on injected pri-miR-375&#x02013;1 or pri-miR-375&#x02013;2 transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050203-g003">Figure 3</xref>B). As expected, each morpholino targeted the transcript to which it was directed. However, the star miR-375 morpholino did not knock down miR-375 completely. In addition, morpholino oligonucleotide (MO) miR-375 did not interfere with processing of miR-375 from pri-miR-375&#x02013;1, possibly because this primary transcript forms a more stable hairpin.

This analysis revealed no change in the formation of the pituitary gland (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050203-g005">Figure 5</xref>B). However, analysis of insulin expression showed a striking malformation of the islet cells in 3-d-old morphant embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050203-g005">Figure 5</xref>B). Wild-type embryos have a single islet at the right side of the midline, whereas the miR-375 knockdown embryos have dispersed insulin-positive cells.

Although the phenotype could be rescued by simultaneous inhibition of a negative regulator of hedgehog signaling, no positive control morpholinos were reported that could mimic the phenotype. In addition, data were lacking that showed an effect of the morpholino on endogenous miR-214 levels.</p><p>The results in this paper show that morpholinos targeting the miRNA precursor form a reliable and efficient tool to deplete the embryo of miRNAs during the first 4 d of development, when most organ systems are formed and miRNAs are expressed. We have shown that miRNA expression can be inhibited by targeting the mature miRNA, the precursor miRNA or the primary miRNA. Our data show that such morpholinos can inhibit miRNA processing at the Drosha cleavage step or the Dicer cleavage step, probably by steric blocking, although the exact mechanism is unclear. In addition, morpholinos targeting the mature miRNA can inhibit their activity, probably by preventing binding to a target mRNA.</p><p>We used morpholinos targeting the mature miRNA for a set of 13 conserved vertebrate miRNAs to identify their developmental functions. By microscopic analysis, we could not observe clear defects associated with loss of 11 of these miRNAs during the first 4 d of embryonic development, although in situ hybridization revealed specific loss of most knocked-down miRNAs. Because all the targeted miRNAs are expressed in very specific tissues and we did not investigate most morphants in much detail by marker analysis, we may have missed subtle defects. In addition, many miRNAs reside in families of related sequence (e.g., let-7 and miR-182), and these should possibly be targeted simultaneously by different morpholinos to obtain a biological effect. Furthermore, in those instances in which miRNAs of unrelated sequence target a similar set of mRNAs when expressed in the same tissue &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050203-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;, removing only one miRNA might not have a profound impact on transcript levels or expression. Finally, microarray analysis and computational predictions have shown that a single miRNA may regulate hundreds of mRNAs &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050203-b030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050203-b031">31</xref>&#x0005d;, but that some miRNAs act as a backup for mRNAs that are already repressed transcriptionally &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050203-b032">32</xref>&#x0005d;. Thus, knockdown of such miRNAs might not dramatically affect gene expression, but ensure robustness of protein interaction networks as for example miR-7 in <italic>Drosophila</italic> &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050203-b033">33</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>In zebrafish, there are two copies of miR-375, and in human and mouse only one copy has been identified &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050203-b034">34</xref>&#x0005d;. To verify the miR-375 knockdown phenotype, we designed control morpholinos targeting both precursors simultaneously (MO miR-375 star) and separately. Complete knockdown was only observed in those instances in which both miR-375 copies were targeted simultaneously. This also led to scattered islet cells, proving the specificity of the phenotype. However, knockdown with miR-375&#x02013;1/2 loop morpholinos did not delay development as seen in the knockdown with the mature miR-375 morpholino. This shows the strength of using control morpholinos and excludes the delayed development as a relevant miR-375 loss-of-function phenotype. A moderate version of the phenotype was also observed in embryos injected with a morpholino specifically targeting miR-375&#x02013;1. Thus, a reduction in the level of miR-375 already disturbs islet integrity. Similar to mouse miR-1 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050203-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;, miR-375 copies survived evolution and are expressed similarly in time and space, probably to ensure the high intracellular concentration of miR-375 necessary to repress many weakly binding targets.</p><p>In a forward genetic screen, several mutants were identified with improper development of the endocrine pancreas &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050203-b035">35</xref>&#x0005d;. These mutants fall into three classes: (1) mutants with severely reduced insulin expression; (2) mutants with reduced insulin expression and abnormal islet morphology; and (3) mutants with normal levels of insulin expression and abnormal islet morphology. However, in all of these mutants, islet cells do not merge into an islet from their first appearance at approximately the 14-somite stage. Our miR-375 knockdown phenotype differs from this, because in the first instance, an islet is formed at approximately 24 hpf, but in later stages, the islet falls apart into small groups of cells. This rules out a general role for miR-375 in early endocrine formation as is seen for Wnt5 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050203-b036">36</xref>&#x0005d;, but rather indicates a role in maintenance of tissue identity, which is assumed to be a general function of miRNAs in development &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050203-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;.

The zebrafish homolog of <italic>myotrophin</italic> also contains a seven-nucleotide seed match to miR-375 (unpublished data), but future studies should reveal whether this target or many other predicted targets are relevant to the phenotype. The specific expression of miR-375 in the pancreatic islet and its implication in insulin secretion make it a candidate drug target in diabetes, e.g., to influence insulin levels in the blood. However, our data show that if miR-375 is used as a drug target, developmental side effects need to be taken into account.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Morpholino and miRNA injections.</title><p>Morpholinos were obtained from Gene Tools LLC (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.gene-tools.com">http://www.gene-tools.com</ext-link>) and dissolved to a concentration of 5 mM in water.
