HGF/c-Met&#x02013;induced tumorigenesis is dependent, in part, on the transcription factor and oncogene signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), which is believed to be activated by the receptor at the plasma membrane and then to travel to the nucleus where it acts. We demonstrate that although the robust signal to STAT3 elicited from the cytokine oncostatin-M does indeed support this mechanism of STAT3 action, for the weaker STAT3 signal emanating from c-Met, the activated receptor itself needs to be delivered to a perinuclear endosomal compartment to sustain phosphorylated STAT3 in the nucleus. This is signal specific because c-Met&#x02013;induced extracellular signal-regulated kinase nuclear accumulation does not require receptor trafficking to the perinuclear compartment. This response is triggered from peripheral endosomes. Thus, control of growth factor receptor traffic determines the nature of the signal output, providing novel opportunities for intervention.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used in this paper: CHC, clathrin heavy chain; EEA1, early endosome autoantigen 1; ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; HGF, hepatocyte growth factor; STAT3, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>C-Met overexpression correlates closely with metastatic tendency and poor prognosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Trusolino and Comoglio, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Birchmeier et al., 2003</xref>).

The STAT3 nuclear accumulation on HGF stimulation correlates with a strong nuclear signal for STAT3 phosphorylated on tyrosine 705 (Fig. S1 B). These results indicate that, according to current models, nonphosphorylated STAT3 undergoes nuclear-cytoplasm shuttling under basal conditions and that HGF stimulates phosphorylated STAT3 nuclear accumulation.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>C-Met and STAT3 colocalize on endosomes.</bold> (A) Confocal sections of HeLa cells stimulated with HGF for 0 or 120 min and stained for STAT3 and DAPI.

However, receptor traffic is not a universal requirement because dynasore or expression of myc-AP180C does not impair the cytokine oncostatin M&#x02013;induced STAT3 nuclear accumulation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, C, E, and F</xref>). Thus, although the oncostatin M receptor has been reported to become internalized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Heinrich et al., 2003</xref>), STAT3 nuclear delivery, upon stimulation with this cytokine, appears to be independent of the endocytic machinery. This is consistent with the previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Heinrich et al., 2003</xref>). The distinctive responses to HGF and oncostatin M indicate that STAT3 delivery to the nucleus can operate through distinct mechanisms in the same cell. STAT3 Y705 phosphorylation was reported not to play a role in STAT3 cytoplasmic-nuclear shuttling under basal conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Pranada et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Liu et al., 2005</xref>), although it was reported to control STAT3 nuclear accumulation upon cytokine or growth factor stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Liu et al., 2005</xref>). Consistent with this and with our immunofluorescence data (Fig. S1 B), it was observed by Western blot that, in parallel to the nuclear accumulation, STAT3 was phosphorylated on Y705 after 2 h (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 I</xref>), which is indicative of a role for tyrosine phosphorylation in nuclear accumulation. In addition, when the endocytic machinery was perturbed through CHC knockdown, dynasore, or concanavalin A treatment, STAT3 Y705 and ERK1/2 phosphorylation were inhibited (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, I and J</xref>; and Fig. S2 C), thus mirroring the loss of nuclear STAT3 and ERK1/2. C-Met phosphorylation was also reduced under these conditions (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 J</xref> and Fig. S2 C; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kermorgant et al., 2004</xref>). These results indicate that to sustain their phosphorylation, STAT3 and ERK1/2 require c-Met endocytosis as well as the maintainance of active c-Met. This response to the blockade of c-Met endocytosis was specific to the Y705 input to STAT3 because the serine 727 phosphorylation induced by HGF was unaffected (unpublished data).</p></sec><sec><title>STAT3, but not ERK1/2, nuclear accumulation upon HGF stimulation is dependent on c-Met trafficking to a perinuclear localization</title><p>It was shown previously that c-Met traffics from a peripheral endosomal compartment to a perinuclear endosomal compartment along the microtubule network and that this is facilitated by PKC&#x003b1; catalytic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kermorgant et al., 2003</xref>). PKC&#x003b1; inhibition by G&#x000f6;6976 (but not inhibition after c-Met traffic; see <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, A and B</xref>), or microtubule disruption by vinblastine, led to a reduction of HGF/c-Met&#x02013;dependent STAT3 nuclear accumulation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, A&#x02013;C</xref>; and Fig. S2 D). This paralleled the perturbation in c-Met traffic, which showed a decrease in perinuclear endosomal c-Met and sustained peripheral endosomal c-Met (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>, right). In contrast to HGF, vinblastine did not block oncostatin M&#x02013;dependent STAT3 nuclear accumulation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 D</xref>). Overexpression of p50/dynamitin, which was previously shown to block dynein-dependent endosomal movements along the microtubules in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Burkhardt et al., 1997</xref>), also impaired HGF-dependent STAT3 nuclear accumulation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 E</xref> and Fig. S2 E). Similar results were obtained in HeLa cells knocked down for PKC&#x003b1; (Fig. S2, F&#x02013;H) and in PKC&#x003b1; knockout mouse fibroblasts (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 F</xref>). It can be concluded that c-Met directional trafficking from the peripheral endosomal compartment toward the perinuclear endosomal compartment is required for HGF/c-Met to maintain STAT3 nuclear accumulation. Similarly, it was described previously that the nerve growth factor&#x02013;dependent transport of ERK5 from distal axons to the cell body and further translocation to the nucleus required endocytosis and microtubule transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ginty and Segal, 2002</xref>). For HGF/c-Met, the process would appear to be dynamic with constant dissociation and reassociation of STAT3 with activated c-Met endosomal complexes, with the steady-state phosphorylation being determined by the c-Met activity/phosphotyrosine phosphatase balance. This behavior would appear to be receptor specific because we show that oncostatin M&#x02013;dependent nuclear uptake of STAT3 does not require receptor endocytosis and microtubule integrity. The kinase/phosphatase balance here is clearly different. Interestingly, HGF/c-Met&#x02013;dependent ERK1/2 nuclear accumulation was not blocked by microtubule disruption (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, G and H</xref>), which is indicative of both a functional endosomal c-Met and distinctive spatial constraints exerted on ERK1/2 activation. Consistent with this, microtubule disruption inhibited HGF-dependent STAT3 but not ERK1/2 phosphorylation (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, I and J</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig3"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>STAT3, but not ERK1/2, nuclear accumulation is promoted by c-Met microtubule-dependent traffic.</bold> (A) HeLa cells stimulated with HGF for 0 or 120 min alone or in the presence of 1 &#x003bc;M G&#x000f6;6976 or 1 &#x003bc;M vinblastine were stained for STAT3 and c-Met.

PM, plasma membrane; En, peripheral endosome; PN, perinuclear endosome; N, nucleus. At the perinuclear location, the proximity of c-Met with the nucleus protects STAT3 against phosphatase activity, allowing a significant increase in nuclear accumulation.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="jcb1820855f05"></graphic></fig><p>The different mechanisms of signal accumulation in the nucleus might reflect signal strength associated with distinct tyrosine kinase activation and phosphorylation of the signaling molecule. Thus, we hypothesized that despite the opposing action of phosphatases, the strength of STAT3 activation upon oncostatin M stimulation and of ERK1/2 activation on HGF stimulation are above a threshold that allows diffusion and nuclear uptake. By comparison, the activation of STAT3 in response to HGF is below the threshold set by phosphatases, and STAT3 is only effectively phosphorylated and accumulates in the nucleus upon delivery of activated c-Met to the perinuclear compartment, limiting exposure to STAT3 protein tyrosine phosphatases. Consistent with this, a 30-min treatment with HGF in the presence of the phosphatase inhibitor vanadate on cells pretreated with dynasore or concanavalin A triggered STAT3 phosphorylation and nuclear accumulation to a level comparable with 120 min of treatment with HGF alone (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, E&#x02013;G</xref>; and Fig. S3, A&#x02013;D, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200806076/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200806076/DC1</ext-link>). Similar effects of vanadate were obtained in cells transfected with mycAP180C (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, H and I</xref>) or pretreated with vinblastine (Fig. S3, E and F).</p><p>HGF-dependent wound healing of STAT3&#x02212;/&#x02212; keratinocytes has been shown to be impaired in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Sano et al., 1999</xref>). To assess the STAT3 requirement in this study, wound healing experiments were performed. STAT3 localization was first analyzed in fixed HeLa cells at the leading edge of the wound. The nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio was increased significantly in migrating cells cultured in the presence of HGF as compared with the less motile cells cultured without HGF (Fig. S3, G and H). This suggested that STAT3 nuclear accumulation plays a role in HGF-dependent wound healing. It was found that HGF increased the wound closure of HeLa cells by twofold after 24 h (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 J</xref> and Fig. S3 I). Incubation of cells with the recently described STAT3-selective inhibitor STA-21 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Song et al., 2005</xref>) blocked HGF-dependent wound closure. The inhibition was HGF specific and toxicity of the compound was excluded because, under basal conditions, STA-21 had no effect on wound healing (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 J</xref> and Fig. S3 I). STA-21 has been reported to inhibit STAT3 nuclear translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Song et al., 2005</xref>) and this was verified in this study (Fig. S3 J). It can be surmised that HGF-dependent HeLa cell wound healing is dependent on the STAT3 pathway and specifically on STAT3 nuclear uptake driven by the endosomal traffic of c-Met.</p><p>This study shows that HGF-dependent STAT3 translocation to the nucleus requires c-Met delivery to the perinuclear compartment and is not triggered by plasma membrane phosphorylation and simple diffusion away from the activated c-Met. In contrast, oncostatin M, in the same cells, triggers nuclear accumulation of STAT3 independent of endocytosis. C-Met endocytosis is required for both ERK1/2 and STAT3 nuclear accumulation. However, although endocytosis alone is sufficient to support ERK1/2 nuclear accumulation, STAT3 accumulation requires microtubule traffic of c-Met to the perinuclear compartment. It is proposed that signal strength determines the nuclear proximity required for signal delivery. Thus, for a very strong signal as observed for oncostatin M&#x02013;stimulated STAT3, sufficient phosphorylation occurs for an appropriate threshold to be reached permitting diffusion through a phosphatase-rich environment to reach and accumulate in the nucleus as a phosphoprotein. In contrast, it is proposed that the much weaker signal from c-Met to STAT3 requires the signal from the receptor itself to be juxtanuclear for the same threshold to be achieved, leading to STAT3 accumulation in the nucleus (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 K</xref>, model). This is consistent not only with the requirement for endocytosis, but also for the subsequent traffic of the activated receptor to the perinuclear compartment to trigger/maintain an increase in nuclear STAT3. This insight into agonist action demonstrates that it is not simply the receptor and immediate adaptors and effectors that determine cellular responses but also the receptor location determined by the regulated traffic of the receptor. This traffic and the subsequent accumulation of nuclear STAT3 are evidently critical to HGF-induced migratory responses.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Growth factor, antibodies, inhibitors and constructs</title><p>Purified human recombinant HGF was obtained from R&#x00026;D Systems and oncostatin M from EMD.
