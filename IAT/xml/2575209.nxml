Through these junctions, cells are able to communicate, synchronize function, and regulate the paracellular flow of molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Epithelial cells are polarized along an apico-basal axis where the apical surface faces the exterior or lumen and the basal surface communicates with the extracellular matrix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In vertebrates, several epithelial intercellular junctions exist, the two most widely studied being tight junctions (TJs) and adherens junctions (AJs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Invertebrate species, although lacking tight junctions possess the functionally analogous septate junction (SJ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Despite a difference in lateral membrane location, TJs (apical to AJs) and SJs (basal to AJs) both form an intercellular barrier to regulate the transepithelial diffusion of solutes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>Ultrastructure and freeze-fracture analysis of cell junctions reveal that SJs maintain a fixed distance between epithelial cells through ladder-like septae that spiral on the outside of the cell and fill the intermembrane space [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. These encircling septae extend the travel distance for molecules to transverse the paracellular path, thereby regulating the flow of material [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. TJs however, appear as a series of contact points, or 'kissing sites'. Freeze-fracture analysis reveals that TJs consist of interconnecting mesh-works of fibrils forming a band-like structure around the cell. In spite of a diverged morphology, globular and transmembrane proteins are suspected to form the bridge between cells filling the intermembrane space of TJs and SJs, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>Two types of SJs have been observed in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, smooth (sSJs) and pleated (pSJs). Smooth SJs, which lack ladder-like septa are found in tissues such as the midgut and malpighian tubules. Pleated SJs are found in all ectodermally-derived epithelial tissues such as trachea, salivary glands, hindgut and epidermis as well as in glial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Glial SJs function to link ensheathing glial cells around peripheral nerves, forming the blood-brain barrier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Recently, SJ were indentified in the apical and basal regions between accessory cells, the cone cells and pigment cells of adult ommatidia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. SJs and TJs, both in epithelia and neurons, share core components suggesting that barrier function is a conserved mechanism between vertebrate and invertebrate species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>Within the last decade, key molecular elements of pSJs have been identified and shown to be involved in processes such as establishing and maintaining cell polarity, cell adhesion and cell-cell interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Coracle (Cora), NeurexinIV (NrxIV), Neuroglian (Nrg), Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+ </sup>ATPase (ATP&#x003b1;), and Discs Large (Dlg) have all been identified as SJ constituents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. <italic>Drosophila </italic>Coracle, a member of the Protein 4.1 family, interacts with transmembrane proteins forming a link to the cytoplasmic surface of the plasma membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Cora localizes to epithelial pSJs, where it is required for SJ organization but is absent from the CNS and its derivatives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Interactions between Cora and transmembrane protein NrxIV are necessary in order to maintain their proper SJ localization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. NrxIV, a member of the neurexin gene family, localizes to all pSJs of ectodermally-derived epithelia and the CNS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. In both <italic>cora </italic>and <italic>nrxIV </italic>mutants, intermembrane septae are absent, resulting in a leaky paracellular seal. While Cora and NrxIV have been found to interact with ATP&#x003b1; at the SJ, they have also been shown to form a complex independently with Nrg. Nrg is an integral membrane glycoprotein that localizes to the lateral membrane of epithelial cells and to the surface of glial cells, regulating the adhesion between neurons and glial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Mutations in either ATP&#x003b1; or Nrg results in mislocalization of Cora and NrxIV and disrupts SJ structure and function. This suggests that interdependent protein complexes function to assemble the protein scaffold regulating paracellular movement. However, among these mutants, epithelial integrity, apico-basal polarization and the localization of SJ protein Dlg are unaffected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p><bold>M</bold>embrane <bold>A</bold>ssociated <bold>GU</bold>anylate <bold>K</bold>inases, MAGUKs, are a class of scaffolding proteins that tether adhesion molecules at sites of cell-cell contact, such as septate and tight junctions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. MAGUK proteins contain a core domain structure consisting of 1&#x02013;3 PDZ domains (named after 3 founding MAGUK proteins <bold>P</bold>SD-95, <bold>D</bold>lg and <bold>Z</bold>O-1), a src homology 3 (SH3) domain and a guanylate kinase domain (GUK) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In addition, some MAGUK members encode an N-terminal L27 domain (named after interacting proteins Lin-2 and Lin-7) which functions in protein-protein interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. This multi-domain composition allows MAGUKs to function as the backbone onto which protein complexes can assemble [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. These complexes then bring together functionally dissimilar proteins to link transmembrane proteins with the cytoskeleton [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><p>The PALS (<bold>P</bold>roteins <bold>A</bold>ssociated with <bold>L</bold>in-7) subfamily of MAGUK proteins, PALS1 and PALS2, anchor scaffolding complexes at junctional regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. <italic>Drosophila </italic>Stardust (Sdt) and its homologue, vertebrate PALS1, function as adapter proteins linking two scaffolding complexes to establish epithelial polarity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The functional significance of PALS2 remains unclear. Vertebrate studies have shown that PALS2 interacts with the C-terminus of Nectin-like molecule 2 (Necl-2) through its PDZ domain at spot-like adhesion sites along the lateral plasma membrane. Furthermore, Necl-2 binds DAL1, a Protein 4.1 family member, implicating PALS2 in membrane organization and scaffold assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. The evolutionary conservation of junctional proteins prompted our search for the invertebrate homologue of PALS2 to elucidate its molecular and genetic function. Our search identified <italic>Drosophila </italic>CG9326, also reported recently as the gene interrupted in the v<italic>aricose </italic>(<italic>vari</italic>) mutation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Our previously reported s<italic>enz'aria </italic>(<italic>szar</italic>) alleles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] are thus renamed as alleles of <italic>vari</italic>.</p><p>We present here our findings of <italic>Drosophila </italic>CG9326, Varicose (Vari), a homologue of vertebrate PALS2. Previous independent studies identify a function for Vari in the function of epithelial SJs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Our studies show that Vari localizes to the SJ in all embryonic ectodermally-derived epithelial tissues as well as glial cells of the PNS. Mutations in <italic>vari </italic>result in mislocalized SJ markers such as NrxIV and compromise the seal of the transepithelial barrier. We have identified Vari expression in larval optic lobe neuroblasts and in the adult nervous system. Furthermore, Varicose is required for the patterning of adult epithelial structures. Adult wing hair extension and orientation, patterning of thoracic bristles, and the patterning of inter-ommatidial bristles are disrupted when <italic>vari </italic>function is reduced or removed. This study identifies both conserved and novel functions for MAGUK proteins in <italic>Drosophila </italic>development.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Varicose, a homologue of vertebrate PALS2/VAM-1</title><p>Our search for the invertebrate homologue of mammalian PALS2 identified <italic>Drosophila </italic>CG9326 as a candidate, sharing 39% amino acid identity to PALS2/VAM-1. Like its vertebrate counterparts, CG9326 encodes a MAGUK protein possessing PDZ, SH3 and GUK domains. The genomic sequence of CG9326 is 8381 bp in length and is composed of 10 introns and 11 exons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Genome annotations predict that CG9326 may generate three transcripts, denoted B, C and D, which would encode three proteins, Vari<sup>L27B</sup>, Vari<sup>L27D </sup>and Vari (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Transcripts B and D, but not C give rise to products encoding two N-terminal L27 domains, as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. L27 domains interact heterophilically to link scaffolding proteins, for example Lin-2 (CASK) and Lin-7 (Veli) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. CG9326-B differs from CG9326-D by a 21 amino acid insertion, as vertebrate PALS2&#x003b2; differs from PALS&#x003b1; by a 14 amino acid insertion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Varicose alleles created by imprecise excision</bold>.

The restricted membrane localization of Vari suggested to us that it may act similarly. We compared Varicose expression with various lateral membrane markers in the hindgut of stage 15 embryos (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E&#x02013;G</xref>, see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>, panels B-G).

Co-localization of Varicose and plasma membrane marker &#x003b1;-Spectrin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] is seen in the apical region of the lateral membrane but Vari is not seen in the basal region, indicating Vari localizes to the apicolateral membrane, a region corresponding to the SJ.

The optic lobe consists of two populations of cells, symmetrically dividing lateral neuroepithelial (NE) cells and asymmetrically dividing medial neuroblasts. NE cells possess similar properties as embryonic epithelial cells and express junctional markers at similar locations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. To determine if Varicose localized to SJs in postembryonic epithelia, we labeled third instar larvae brains with Vari and Dlg. Dlg localizes to the SJ in NE cells (arrow, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3F</xref>) and to the cortex in neuroblasts (left of arrowheads, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E&#x02013;G</xref>). In contrast to what we observed in embryonic epithelia, Varicose has limited co-localization with Dlg (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3G</xref>). Varicose expression is found in the apical cytoplasm of NE cells (arrow, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E</xref>) but is not found in neuroblasts (left of arrowheads, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E</xref>). We were unable to detect neuroepithelial labeling with pre-immune sera suggesting the observed pattern is due to Varicose expression (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>, panels B-D). If this expression pattern is true for other SJ markers, we would expect to see NrxIV at the SJ of NE cells. We did not observe any NrxIV expression in NE cells or in neuroblasts; we however did detect expression in neuroblast progeny (not shown). Expression of Varicose restricted to the neuroepithelium of the optic lobe suggests a role in the symmetrically dividing cell pool.

It has been suggested that a MAGUK member may act to tether Mega to the NrxIV/Cora complex to assemble the SJ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>]. We propose Vari as a candidate for this function.</p></sec><sec><title>A role for MAGUKs in the nervous system?</title><p>Expression of Vari in peripheral glia, but not the perineural sheath or midline glia of the embryonic nervous system is consistent with function in the establishment of ectodermally-derived pSJs. Neural expression was not detected in embryos. However, the distribution of Vari in the late larval and adult central nervous system suggests non-junctional roles for this MAGUK. In the optic lobe NE, which does express Dlg, Vari expression overlaps, and extends into the apical cytoplasm. Vari is not expressed in NBs of the embryo and medial optic lobe, yet is expressed in the cytoplasm of some central NBs of late third instar, and in low levels in the soma of differentiated neurons. This pattern of expression is not typical of other junctional or cell polarity markers like Bazooka, Glaikit or Miranda [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>], or of MAGUKs in general and must be clarified by further study. This issue may be approached with nervous system specific RNAi knockdown of Vari, which we found to be pupal lethal (data not shown).</p><p>Several independent lines of evidence suggest that our serum is specific to Varicose. First, our epithelial expression pattern observed during embyrogenesis is consistent with previous reports on <italic>varicose </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Second, a null allele, <italic>vari</italic><sup>48<italic>EP</italic></sup>, lacks wildtype Varicose imunolabeling. Third, the NE expression pattern is absent when third instar larval brains are labeled with pre-immune sera. Fourth, our antibody detects Varicose expression in the ventral midline when <italic>UAS-vari </italic>is mis-expressed in the midline using <italic>single-minded GAL4</italic>. Fifth, although normal protein levels are at the threshold of detection, over-expression of <italic>UAS-var</italic>i using heat-shock <italic>GAL4 </italic>provides ample protein to be detected by western blotting (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Varicose is involved in regulating tube size</title><p>The <italic>Drosophila </italic>tracheal system is a well developed model for the dissection of pathways regulating tube formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. pSJ components are implicated in the regulation of tubule size. Genes regulating tube size fall into two phenotypic categories; those required to regulate tube length and those required for normal tube diameter (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]). Several lines of evidence have suggested that pSJ components are involved in regulating tube length. Mutations in genes for SJ proteins like <italic>mega</italic>, <italic>sinu </italic>and the Na<sup>+</sup>K<sup>+</sup>ATPase &#x003b2; subunit, <italic>nrv2 </italic>have tortuous and elongated tracheal trunks, without affecting tube diameter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>]. In contrast, mutations in <italic>vari </italic>do not appear to affect tube length. Tracheal tubes in <italic>vari </italic>mutants have irregular and enlarged tube diameters reminiscent of mutations affecting <italic>mmy/cystic </italic>and <italic>kkv</italic>, enzymes required for chitin synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>]. Epistatic analysis of <italic>vari </italic>and <italic>sinu </italic>reveals a tracheal phenotype in double mutants that is worse than either single mutant, suggesting these proteins function in different pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>].</p><p>The chitin matrix is secreted from the apical surface of tracheal cells and synthesis of the matrix has been linked to controlling tube diameter. During expansion of the dorsal trunk, the cylinder expands as the lumen dilates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. It is suggested that formation of the chitin matrix is needed for the organized radial expansion of tracheal tubes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>]. Tracheal enlargement in <italic>vari </italic>is similar to <italic>cystic </italic>and <italic>kkv </italic>mutants, and all three have reduced deposition of 2A12 antigen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>]. Wu and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] further show that <italic>vari </italic>mutants fail to secrete apical protein Serpentine and secrete variable amounts of Vermiform. Unexpectedly, cuticle ultrastructure and taenidial ridges appear normal in <italic>vari </italic>mutants. This result is unlike tracheal mutants affecting tube length, such as <italic>sinu</italic>, where taenidial folds are irregular [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. Our data suggests that lumenal protein secretion in <italic>vari </italic>mutants is sufficient to produce cuticle and regulate tube length, and that the SJ may also play a role in regulating tube diameter.</p></sec><sec><title>MAGUKs are involved in morphogenesis of adult tissues</title><p>Our knowledge of the function of septate junctions during metamorphosis is limited, however a role for SJs in the adult ommatidium has been described. The SJ component NrxIV was shown to localize to junctional regions in the pupal and adult eye. Loss of <italic>nrxIV </italic>disrupts SJ function, which leads to structural disorganization resulting from a loss of adhesion between cells of the adult ommatidia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Although <italic>nrxIV</italic><sup>- </sup>clones survive in the adult eye [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], <italic>vari</italic><sup>- </sup>clones do not, indicating that <italic>vari </italic>has functions other than localizing NrxIV. Partial restoration of <italic>vari </italic>(by transgene rescue) during adult morphogenesis results in missing ommatidia and irregular bristle patterning. Vari may spatially organise adhesions during this developmental process, and reduced levels of Vari disrupts epithelial patterning. Vari levels are much lower subsequent to <italic>vari-RNAi </italic>treatment described by Bachmann et al., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. The retinal and wing epithelia survive, but epithelial patterning is more disorganised. We report that mosaic null clones of <italic>vari </italic>generate duplicated bristles in the eye, and clumped sensory hairs on the thorax. The failure to establish SJs in these clones may result in delaminating mutant cells adopting a neurogenic fate, and thereby generate extra sensory structures.</p><p>The involvement of SJs during wing imaginal disc to adult wing morphogenesis is also unclear. However, two known SJ components, Gli and Cora are required for survival of pre-hair cells during pupation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. Similar to mutations in <italic>gli </italic>and <italic>cora</italic>, our partial rescue of <italic>vari</italic>, and RNAi of <italic>vari </italic>resulted in patches of wing hairs that fail to point distally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. Although reminiscent of a Frizzled (Fz) planar cell polarity phenotype, the mechanism regulating hair alignment acts independently of Fz. Patches of wing hairs, although not pointing distally, retain a parallel alignment with neighbouring hairs in <italic>Fz </italic>mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>]. This is unlike the random alignment seen in <italic>vari</italic>, <italic>gli</italic>, and <italic>cora </italic>mutants where polarity of neighbouring wing hairs is different. During pupal development, the position and orientation of wing prehairs are determined and then stabilized during later stages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. Vari and other SJ proteins play a role in prehair patterning.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The MAGUK protein PALS2 has been proposed to act in scaffold formation at the basolateral membrane of mammalian epithelia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Here we show that a <italic>Drosophila </italic>homologue, Vari, is similarly distributed, and is required in ectodermally-derived epithelia to elaborate pSJs and establish a paracellular barrier. Embryos lacking <italic>vari </italic>function display mislocalization of essential pSJ membrane proteins, including NrxIV, Na<sup>+</sup>K<sup>+</sup>ATPase and FasIII, and are unable to control the permeability of the tracheal membrane. As a result, the trachea fail to fill with air, and the embryos die in early stage 17. The function of SJs in the morphogenesis of the wing and eye is less well characterised, yet imaginal epithelia lacking <italic>vari</italic>, <italic>cora </italic>or <italic>gli </italic>do not survive to the adult. The eye and wing phenotypes of reduced <italic>vari </italic>function overlaps with patterning defects of mutations in SJ genes <italic>nrxIV</italic>, <italic>gli </italic>and <italic>cora</italic>. Together, they indicate an uncharacterised role for SJs in establishing pattern in epithelial sheets. Vari is not expressed in the embryonic central nervous system, but is expressed apically in the neuroepithelium of the optic lobes and in neuronal cell bodies. These structures do not have pSJs, and indicate that there are uncharacterised functions of Vari, distinct from a role in the assembly of cell junctions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title><italic>Drosophila </italic>stocks</title><p>Canton-S P was used as a wildtype control.
