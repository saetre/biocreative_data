Anti-coagulation is an attractive option for ARDS treatment, and this has promoted development of new antibodies. However, preclinical trials for these antibodies are often limited by the high cost and availability of non-human primates. In the present study, we developed a novel alternative method to test the role of a humanized anti-tissue factor mAb in acute lung injury with transgenic mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>Human tissue factor knock-in (hTF-KI) transgenic mice and a novel humanized anti-human tissue factor mAb (anti-hTF mAb, CNTO859) were developed. The hTF-KI mice showed a normal and functional expression of hTF. The anti-hTF mAb specifically blocked the pro-coagulation activity of brain extracts from the hTF-KI mice and human, but not from wild type mice. An extrapulmonary ARDS model was used by intestinal ischemia-reperfusion. Significant lung tissue damage in hTF-KI mice was observed after 2 h reperfusion. Administration of CNTO859 (5 mg/kg, i.v.) attenuated the severity of lung tissue injury, decreased the total cell counts and protein concentration in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, and reduced Evans blue leakage. In addition, the treatment significantly reduced alveolar fibrin deposition, and decreased tissue factor and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 activity in the serum. This treatment also down-regulated cytokine expression and reduced cell death in the lung.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>This novel anti-hTF antibody showed beneficial effects on intestinal ischemia-reperfusion induced acute lung injury, which merits further investigation for clinical usage. In addition, the use of knock-in transgenic mice to test the efficacy of antibodies against human-specific proteins is a novel strategy for preclinical studies.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>One of the important features and major underlying mechanisms of acute lung injury (ALI) and its severe form acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is the intensive inflammatory response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001527-Liu1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

In the present study, we tested a humanized anti-hTF monoclonal antibody (CNTO859) in a clinically relevant ALI model induced by intestinal ischemia-reperfusion (IIR). However instead of using non-human primates, we developed human TF knock-in (hTF-KI) transgenic mice, which express human TF instead of murine TF (mTF).

Briefly, male hTF-KI mice (6&#x02013;8 weeks, 25&#x02013;30 g) were anesthetized with 5&#x00025; isoflurane. A tracheostomy cannula for mouse (H.

Anesthesia was maintained with 1.5&#x00025; isoflurane and body temperature was maintained at 37&#x000b0;C throughout the experiment. A midline laparatomy was performed and the superior mesenteric artery was identified and occluded below the celiac trunk with an arterial micro-clamp (Mizuho Ikakogyo, Tokyo, Japan). Intestinal ischemia was confirmed by paleness of the jejunum and ileum. After 45 min of ischemia period, reperfusion was initiated by removal of the clamp and confirmed by the color recovery of the intestine. Pre-warmed (37&#x000b0;C) saline (0.5 ml) was instilled into the peritoneal cavity before closed with a suture. At 10 min after the onset of reperfusion, hTF-KI mice were randomized into 2 groups treated with either anti-hTF mAb (CNTO859, 5 mg/kg) or saline at same volume (2.5 ml/kg) through the jugular vein. Anesthesia and ventilation were terminated after treatment. All animals were left on spontaneous breathing during the 2 h of reperfusion, and then sacrificed by exsanguinations.

The substitution or replacement of a murine protein with its human counterpart is crucial for evaluating human-specific therapeutic agents in murine models. The specificity and efficacy of the humanized monoclonal antibody is also critically important. The anti-hTF monoclonal antibody, CNTO859, specifically binds to hTF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001527-Ngo1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, and inhibits the hTF activation in brain extracts from human tissue and the hTF-KI transgenic mice, but not from wild type littermate mice. It should be mentioned that we used the antibody CNTO859 at a very high dose (20 mg/kg) in our preliminary experiments, and observed no significant haemorrhage in the treated animals, indicating the safety of the antibody (data not shown). These features are important for its potential clinical application in the future.</p><p>ARDS is a multi-factorial syndrome with similar pathological manifestations but distinct underlying mechanisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001527-Liu1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Anti-TF therapy is attractive not only because of TF's role in the coagulation cascade, but also because of its pivotal role in the interplay with inflammatory signaling. TF binding to Factor VIIa leads to activation of Factor X, forming a transient ternary complex, which activates coagulation, thus resulting in thrombin generation, and ultimately the clot formation. This complex has been demonstrated as being critical for presenting Factor VIIa and Factor Xa to PARs on the cell surface. Cleavage of PARs initiates the inflammatory rather than coagulant activities of TF, including upregulation of cytokine gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001527-Riewald1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001527-Camerer1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001527-WeltyWolf1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>.

This is a clinically relevant model in which the severe intestinal damage is the initial insult. The lung is the most vulnerable remote organ after IIR, although cell death and inflammation have been noted in other vital organs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001527-Mura2">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. This model has added value to other studies related to anti-TF therapies. Our data show a significant attenuation of the lung injury induced by IIR. The pulmonary permeability barrier consists of capillary endothelial and alveolar epithelial cells. Damage could occur on both sides of the alveolar walls during ALI <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001527-Ware2">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. In the present study, administration of anti-hTF antibody not only protected pulmonary endothelium from severe injury, but also significantly reduced cell death in the lung tissue, which mainly happens in alveolar epithelial cells upon IIR challenge <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001527-Mura2">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, anti-TF therapy may have protective effects on both endothelial and epithelial layers of alveolar walls. Ideally, a humanized IgG, instead of normal saline should be used for comparison with CNT0859, to exclude non-specific IgG effects. Our studies were limited by the availability of this agent; the results should be interpreted with caution.</p><p>The pulmonary level of TF expression has been found especially high relative to other organs. The TF levels in pulmonary edema fluid were found to be more than 100-fold higher than that in the plasma in patients with ALI/ARDS, indicating a local hypercoagulation status and tissue damages in the lung. The TF expression and activity in lung alveolar epithelial cells was increased by pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. TNF&#x003b1; and IL-1&#x000df;) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001527-Bastarache1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. We speculate that local administration of an anti-TF antibody may have direct benefits to ameliorate ALI, especially injury induced by intrapulmonary insults, such as acid aspiration and lung transplantation.</p><p>The hTF-KI animals and the specific antibody may offer us a useful model system to better characterize and understand the effects of anti-TF therapy in ALI models induced by other insults, such as sepsis, ventilator-induced lung injury, bacterial infection, etc. Results from these studies may provide additional information about the role of TF, as well as the potential therapeutic efficacy of CNTO859. Using small animals, we will be able to collect critical data prior to studies in non-human primates and clinical trials. This strategy should be considered for the development of species-specific therapeutic reagents for ALI/ARDS and other human diseases.</p><p>In summary, this study demonstrated the potential therapeutic effects of anti-TF strategy on ALI/ARDS with a new anti-TF monoclonal antibody. The new experimental strategy of using humanized antibody against human TF in transgenic mice offers a useful tool for further assessing the anti-TF therapy in preclinical trials for ARDS as well as other diseases related to the function of tissue factor.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Dr. Huadong Zhu for his participation in the animal experiments; Ms. Suzanne Beaudin and Dr. Patricia C.
