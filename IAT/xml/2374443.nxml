Integrin signalling is modulated by various mechanisms, including interaction with other transmembrane proteins. We aimed to identify whether one such protein, integrin-associated protein (CD47/IAP), is expressed by chondrocytes and whether it may regulate integrin-dependent mechanotransduction.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Chondrocytes, isolated from macroscopically normal and osteoarthritic articular cartilage of human knee joints, were studied in a resting state or following mechanical stimulation at 0.33 Hz. CD47/IAP expression and associations were confirmed by immunohistology, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting, and immunoprecipitation. Roles in mechanotransduction were studied by assessing effects of function-blocking antibodies on a range of electrophysiological, cellular, and molecular responses of primary chondrocytes and responses of CD47/IAP-null cell lines transfected with CD47/IAP.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Human articular chondrocytes were shown to express CD47/IAP, predominantly the type 2 isoform. Immunoprecipitation showed association of CD47/IAP with &#x003b1;5 integrin and thrombospondin but not SIRP&#x003b1; (signal-regulatory protein-alpha). The function-blocking anti-CD47/IAP antibody Bric 126 inhibited changes in membrane potential, tyrosine phosphorylation, and elevation of relative levels of aggrecan mRNA induced by mechanical stimulation, whereas in the presence of B6H12, an antibody that has partial agonist activity, a membrane depolarisation rather than a membrane hyperpolarisation response was induced by mechanical stimulation. CD47-null cell lines did not show changes in cell membrane potential following mechanical stimulation. Changes in cell membrane potential following mechanical stimulation were seen when CD47-null cells were transfected with CD47/IAP expression vectors but were not seen following mechanical stimulation of cells transfected with vectors for the extracellular immunoglobulin variable (IgV) domain of CD47/IAP in the absence of the transmembrane and intracellular domains.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>CD47/IAP is necessary for chondrocyte mechanotransduction. Through interactions with &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 integrin and thrombospondin, CD47/IAP may modulate chondrocyte responses to mechanical signals.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Structural integrity of articular cartilage is dependent on physical loading and joint movement. Overloading and unloading are associated with proteoglycan depletion leading to osteoarthritis (OA), whereas proteoglycan synthesis and articular cartilage thickness are increased by mechanical stresses associated with physiological levels of exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The mechanisms by which mechanical forces regulate chondrocyte function are beginning to be defined and appear to involve the activation of a variety of intracellular signalling pathways, at least some of which require integrin-mediated events. In normal human articular chondrocytes, cyclical mechanical stimulation at 0.33 Hz (2 seconds on, 1 second off) <italic>in vitro </italic>results in activation of a mechanotransduction pathway that ultimately leads to upregulation of aggrecan gene expression and downregulation of matrix metalloproteinase-3 gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The mechanotransduction pathway appears to be dependent on &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 integrin signalling, stretch-activated ion channels, the actin cytoskeleton, and subsequent secretion of interleukin-4, which (via a paracrine/autocrine signalling loop) results in the activation of the enzymes phospholipase C and protein kinase C, and the production of inositol triphosphate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In contrast, although mechanical stimulation activates &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1-mediated signalling events, chondrocytes from osteoarthritic cartilage do not show alteration in levels of aggrecan or matrix metalloproteinase-3 mRNA following 0.33-Hz mechanical stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. The reasons why normal and OA chondrocyte mechanotransduction through &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 integrin differ are unclear. However, previous experiments undertaken with human bone cells, in which antibodies to the integrin-associated protein (CD47/IAP) had different effects on integrin-dependent responses, suggest critical roles for this molecule in mechanotransduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>CD47/IAP is a 45- to 55-kDa plasma membrane protein that is physically and functionally associated with integrins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. CD47/IAP has a heavily glycosylated extracellular immunoglobulin variable (IgV)-like domain, a domain containing multiple membrane-spanning segments, and a short cytoplasmic tail. Four alternatively spliced forms that differ in the length of the cytoplasmic tail have been identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. CD47/IAP has a broad tissue expression and has been identified as a receptor for thrombospondin (TSP) family members [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and signal-regulatory protein-alpha (SIRP&#x003b1;) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The roles of CD47/IAP are being elucidated and it is becoming increasingly clear that it has important roles in regulation and modulation of integrin signalling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. CD47/IAP is found in association with &#x003b1;V&#x003b2;3 and other integrins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Antibodies to CD47/IAP have been shown to block the increase in intracellular calcium which occurs upon endothelial cell adhesion to fibronectin-coated surfaces without affecting cell adhesion to those surfaces and to inhibit activation of neutrophil polymorphonucleocyte activity, including phagocytosis, respiratory burst, and transendothelial and transepithelial chemotaxis induced by arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD) containing synthetic peptides and protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Ligation of CD47/IAP on melanoma cells results in modulation of &#x003b1;V&#x003b2;3 function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. CD47/IAP associates with &#x003b1;2&#x003b2;1 integrin on vascular smooth muscle cells and can modify the function of this integrin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Furthermore, ligation of CD47/IAP to &#x003b1;V&#x003b2;3 ligation inhibits &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 and &#x003b1;V&#x003b2;5 integrin-dependent phagocytosis (F.P. Lindberg, unpublished observations). The molecular mechanisms by which CD47/IAP regulates integrin-mediated events are being elucidated, and studies suggest that CD47/IAP ligation may lead to modulation of integrin conformation and affinity state or influence integrin-mediated signal transduction at a further downstream level via a Gi-type heterotrimeric G protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. This study was undertaken to establish whether CD47/IAP is expressed by human articular chondrocytes and to establish whether it and potential ligands such as TSP and SIRP&#x003b1; have roles in integrin-dependent responses of human articular chondrocytes to mechanical stimulation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Source of tissue, chondrocyte culture, and cell lines</title><p>Human articular cartilage was obtained with ethical approval from the Lothian Research Ethics Committee and patients' consent at operation from knee joint arthroplasty specimens and amputations for peripheral vascular disease.

The chamber was pressurised using helium gas from a cylinder at a frequency determined by an electronic timer that controlled the inlet and outlet valves. The standard stimulation regime used was a frequency of 0.33 Hz (2 seconds on, 1 second off) for 20 minutes at 37&#x000b0;C at a pressure of 16 kPa above atmospheric pressure.

In contrast, chondrocytes from osteoarthritic cartilage show a membrane depolarisation response.

In normal chondrocytes, mechanical signal results in activation of SK (small conductance) calcium-activated potassium channels, with potassium efflux and cell membrane hyperpolarisation. In osteoarthritic chondrocytes, the mechanotransduction pathway leads to activation of tetrodotoxin-sensitive channels, sodium influx, and cell membrane depolarisation. To establish whether CD47/IAP has roles in the response of articular chondrocytes to 0.33-Hz mechanical stimulation, chondrocytes were mechanically stimulated in the presence of the function-modifying anti-CD47/IAP antibodies Bric 126 and B6H12 (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>).

Co-immunoprecipitation studies showed associations between CD47/IAP and both &#x003b1;5 integrin and TSP-1. CD47/IAP did not co-immunoprecipitate with SIRP&#x003b1;. These results are not surprising as interactions of CD47/IAP and integrins are through a cis mechanism whereby adjacent molecules in the cell membrane of an individual cell may interact. In contrast, CD47/IAP-SIRP&#x003b1; interactions are typically trans in nature, interactions being between molecules on adjacent cells. As chondrocytes do not make cell-cell contact in cartilage, such trans interactions would not be expected.

CD47/IAP has been shown to co-immunoprecipitate with a number of integrins, including &#x003b1;V&#x003b2;3, the platelet fibrinogen receptor &#x003b1;II&#x003b2;3, the collagen receptor &#x003b1;2&#x003b2;1, and &#x003b1;4&#x003b2;1 in other cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. The molecular interactions between CD47/IAP and integrins have best been studied in respect to &#x003b1;V&#x003b2;3 integrin and suggest that associations between CD47/IAP and &#x003b1;V&#x003b2;3 integrin are dependent on the extracellular IgV domain of CD47/IAP, the multiple membrane-spanning segment aiding stabilisation of the molecular complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Associations between &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 integrin and CD47/IAP are likely to occur through similar mechanisms, and an intact supramolecular complex may be necessary for integrin-mediated mechanotransduction. The observations that an anti-CD47/IAP antibody B6H12 that has partial agonist activity modulated the response to mechanical stimulation would support this idea. This antibody, which is inhibitory for &#x003b1;V&#x003b2;3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] and &#x003b1;II&#x003b2;3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] integrin functions, activates &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1- and &#x003b1;4&#x003b2;1-dependent adhesion of CD47/IAP-expressing cells by a process that involves activation of a CD47/IAP &#x003b1;4&#x003b2;1 complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>The mechanism by which CD47/IAP influences chondrocyte mechanotransduction is unclear and may involve integrin-dependent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] and -independent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] pathways. Previous work in a variety of cell systems supports involvement of G&#x003b1;i-containing heterotrimeric GTPases in CD47/IAP regulation of integrin activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. More recently, a different mechanism by which CD47/IAP can modulate integrin affinity without intracellular signalling has been suggested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. The extracellular IgV domain of CD47/IAP may interact with the integrin, inducing change to a high-affinity state presumably by modulating a structural change in the integrin extracellular domain. In the present work, transfection studies were undertaken with a human ovarian carcinoma cell line and a mouse lung fibroblast cell line, rather than human chondrocytes, in an attempt to provide additional understanding of CD47/IAP involvement in cellular mechanotransduction. Although these cells may express integrin profiles different from that of articular chondrocytes and mechanotransduction pathways may be different, the results allow some speculation of how CD47/IAP may function in mechanical signalling. Our observations that OV10 cells expressing the extracellular IgV domain of CD47/IAP attached to the plasma membrane with a glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchor did not show electrophysiological responses to mechanical stimulation suggest that the multiple membrane-spanning domain or the cytoplasmic tail or both are necessary for mechanotransduction. The multiple membrane-spanning domain may act to stabilise associations of CD47/IAP with integrins, whereas the cytoplasmic tail may be involved in regulation of the cytoskeleton through PLICs (proteins linking IAP to cytoskeleton) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Alternatively, interactions between CD47/IAP, integrins, and P2Y<sub>2</sub>Rs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], which recently have been demonstrated to be involved in chondrocyte and bone cell mechanotransduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], may be important for coupling the P2Y<sub>2</sub>R to G<sub>o</sub>.</p><p>Inhibition of the electrophysiological response of chondrocytes by anti-TSP-1 antibodies in addition to the function-blocking anti-CD47/IAP antibody Bric 126 suggests that TSP-CD47/IAP interactions may also be important in chondrocyte responses to mechanical stimulation. CD47/IAP is known to be a receptor for TSPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], recognising and binding to the RFYVVMWK sequence expressed in the C-terminal cell-binding domain. TSP-1 and TSP5/cartilage oligomeric matrix protein (COMP) are known to be present in human cartilage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. TSP5/COMP has roles in collagen fibril formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>], but functions for cellular-associated TSP in cartilage are not clear. In chondrocytes, a TSP-CD47/IAP complex may associate with &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 integrin to modulate alterations in integrin affinity/avidity state critical in the mechanotransduction process. Indeed, the proximity of the RGD and RFYVVMWK motifs in the TSP molecule might allow for simultaneous engagement of &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 integrin and CD47/IAP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. It has been speculated that the five membrane-spanning segments of CD47/IAP and the two membrane-spanning domains of the heterodimeric integrin form an <italic>ad hoc </italic>seven-transmembrane receptor that, with an adhesive ligand such as TSP, could activate GTPase activity in a manner analogous to that of conventional heptaspanins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>].

Mechanical loading within a physiological range is necessary for the maintenance of articular cartilage in a healthy state, whereas overloading or underloading typically results in cartilage degeneration and development of OA. Whether chondrocytes show remodelling, anabolic, or catabolic responses to mechanical stimuli depends on a number of factors, including the nature of the mechanical stimulus, the source of the cartilage, and donor age. <italic>In vitro </italic>studies have demonstrated that dynamic stimulation leads to proteoglycan synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>], resulting in an anabolic, protective response. In contrast, static, injurious, or high-magnitude mechanical stimuli inhibit aggrecan and type II collagen gene expression and induce catabolic activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. The mechanotransduction process by which mechanical forces are transduced from the outside of the chondrocyte into biochemical signals leading to altered gene expression and protein production is slowly beginning to be understood. Integrins are recognised as being important in this process, but it is clear that molecules that modify integrin activation and downstream cell activity may have significant roles in regulation of chondrocyte responses to mechanical stimulation. In the present study, we have identified CD47/IAP as a further important accessory molecule for &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1-integrin-dependent human articular chondrocyte mechanotransduction. CD47/IAP is expressed by chondrocytes in normal and osteoarthritic cartilage and is necessary for the integrin-dependent anabolic response of normal chondrocytes to mechanical stimulation. Chondrocytes from osteoarthritic cartilage, however, also demonstrate CD47/IAP-dependent mechanotransduction, although in these cells an anabolic response is not produced. As CD47/IAP interactions with integrins are important for the generation and specificity of downstream responses following integrin activation, it is possible that modulation of these interactions in disease may contribute to the abnormal phenotype and behaviour of osteoarthritic chondrocytes. It remains to be seen whether it will be possible to modulate chondrocyte mechanoreceptors such as CD47/IAP and integrins <italic>in vivo</italic>. If this is possible, it may be that mechanomimetics or small molecules can be developed that modify cellular mechanotransduction in such a way that catabolic mechanical stimuli would be inhibited or sensed as anabolic stimuli resulting in chondroprotective responses that will lead to slowing, or even reversal, of disease progression in OA.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>BSA = bovine serum albumin; COMP = cartilage oligomeric matrix protein; GAPDH = glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase; HRP = horseradish peroxidase; IAP = integrin-associated protein; IgV = immunoglobulin variable; OA = osteoarthritis; PCR = polymerase chain reaction; RGD = arginine-glycine-aspartic acid; SIRP&#x003b1; = signal-regulatory protein-alpha; TBST = Tris-buffered saline Tween-20; TSP = thrombospondin.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>MO and HSL (as part of their PhD studies) carried out the experiments on CD47/IAP expression by immunohistochemistry, co-immunoprecipitation, and Western blotting in addition to undertaking analysis of signalling events and changes in cell membrane potential following mechanical stimulation of chondrocytes. BG undertook some of the studies on the effects of mechanical stimulation and anti-CD47/IAP (as a visiting student) on chondrocytes and cell lines. SJMS co-supervised the work of MO, HSL, and BG and carried out the molecular analysis within the study. MOW undertook some electrophysiological experiments and supervised similar experiments by MO, HSL, and BG. FPL provided the CD47/IAP-null and transfected cell lines and was involved in the analysis of results of the studies on these cells. DMS conceived of the study, participated in its design and coordination, participated in the interpretation of results, and predominantly drafted the manuscript. All authors read and approved the final manuscript.</p></sec></body><back><ack><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by grants from the Action Medical Research and Arthritis Research Campaign, the Ministry of Health and Medical Education Iran (MO), and the National Defence Medical Center and Tri-Service General Hospital, Taiwan (HSL) (NSC 91-2314-B-016-034 and TGSH-C91-58).
