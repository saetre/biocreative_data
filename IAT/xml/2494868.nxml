To decipher the mechanism underlying the formation of tau aggregates, we developed a novel approach for constructing models of natively unfolded proteins. The method, energy-minima mapping and weighting (EMW), samples local energy minima of subsequences within a natively unfolded protein and then constructs ensembles from these energetically favorable conformations that are consistent with a given set of experimental data. A unique feature of the method is that it does not strive to generate a single ensemble that represents the unfolded state. Instead we construct a number of candidate ensembles, each of which agrees with a given set of experimental constraints, and focus our analysis on local structural features that are present in all of the independently generated ensembles. Using EMW we generated ensembles that are consistent with chemical shift measurements obtained on tau constructs. Thirty models were constructed for the second microtubule binding repeat (MTBR2) in wild-type (WT) tau and a &#x00394;K280 mutant, which is found in some forms of frontotemporal dementia. By focusing on structural features that are preserved across all ensembles, we find that the aggregation-initiating sequence, PHF6&#x0002a;, prefers an extended conformation in both the WT and &#x00394;K280 sequences. In addition, we find that residue K280 can adopt a loop/turn conformation in WT MTBR2 and that deletion of this residue, which can adopt nonextended states, leads to an increase in locally extended conformations near the C-terminus of PHF6&#x0002a;. As an increased preference for extended states near the C-terminus of PHF6&#x0002a; may facilitate the propagation of &#x003b2;-structure downstream from PHF6&#x0002a;, these results explain how a deletion at position 280 can promote the formation of tau aggregates.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Alzheimer's disease pathology is characterized by two types of protein aggregates that are found in the brain&#x02014;amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Several studies suggest that these aggregates also play an active role in the disease process. Thus, an understanding of disease pathogenesis may be facilitated by a detailed characterization of the proteins that comprise these aggregates. Our study aims to model structural characteristics of tau protein, which is found in neurofibrillary tangles. Modeling of tau is particularly difficult because the protein is intrinsically disordered and therefore must be modeled as an ensemble of structurally dissimilar states. We developed a novel modeling approach that incorporates experimental measurements to generate ensembles of conformations that model the unfolded state of tau. By analyzing structural properties in these model ensembles for both normal and disease-associated forms of the protein, we identify structural features that may facilitate tau aggregation.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s2"><title>Introduction</title><p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology is characterized by extracellular aggregates of A&#x003b2;-amyloid (A&#x003b2;) and intraneuronal tau aggregates, known as senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000155-Selkoe1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Despite much focus on A&#x003b2; amyloid in AD research, tau seems to play an important role as well. For example, the number of NFTs and not the number of senile plaques in the neocortex correlates with the severity of dementia in AD patients, and there are data that imply that abnormalities in tau alone may cause neurodegeneration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000155-Arriagada1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. In light of these observations, a detailed characterization of the structure of tau protein may provide insights into the pathogenesis of AD and other neurodegenerative disorders associated with tau pathology. However, probing the structure of tau is difficult because tau protein is natively unfolded (or intrinsically disordered) in solution. Several studies suggest that tau retains its function after heat or acid-induced denaturation and both CD and X-ray scattering experiments imply that tau does not adopt a well-defined folded structure in solution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000155-Drewes1">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000155-Schweers1">5</xref>. Consequently, obtaining structural and hence functional information on tau is problematic because the direct observation of unfolded states is typically difficult to achieve experimentally.</p><p>Initially, unfolded proteins were described as random coils whose properties are derived from Flory's statistical description of chain molecules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000155-Flory1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. For such polymers, the radius of gyration, <italic>R</italic><sub>G</sub>, follows the scaling law <italic>R</italic><sub>G</sub>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;<italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub><italic>N<sup>&#x003bd;</sup></italic>, where <italic>R</italic><sub>0</sub> is the radius of gyration of a monomeric subunit (a function of the persistence length), <italic>N</italic> is the number of subunits in the polymer, and <italic>&#x003bd;</italic> is a scaling factor that depends on the solvent characteristics. The most common measure of whether a protein behaves as a random coil is to test whether its radius of gyration follows this scaling law. However, while a structurally disordered molecule can exhibit random coil statistics, the converse is not necessarily true; i.e., random coil statistics do not imply that the structure is completely disordered <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000155-Fitzkee1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Slight structural preferences may exist for some natively unfolded proteins and small changes in the distribution of conformers within an unfolded ensemble may play a role in the normal and pathological functioning of intrinsically disordered systems. A recent study, for example, suggests that inducer-mediated tau polymerization involves an allosterically regulated conformational change <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000155-Carlson1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. This is consistent with the notion that the formation of tau fibrils is associated with a shift in the conformational distribution of tau such that the unfolded state has a preference for proaggregatory conformations in the presence of an inducer. In light of this, constructing detailed ensembles that model the unfolded ensemble of tau may facilitate the identification of structural properties that promote aggregation.</p><p>As full-length tau contains more than 400 amino acids (441 residues for the htau40 isoform <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000155-Andreadis1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>) constructing detailed ensembles that model the unfolded state of this protein is a daunting task. Fortunately, tau contains three or four imperfect microtubule-binding repeats (MTBRs) near the C-terminus of the protein, and almost all known mutations of tau that are associated with inherited forms of neurodegenerative diseases are located in MTBR domains or their nearby flanking regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000155-Goedert1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. As these data suggest that MTBRs play an important role in the progression of inherited tauopathies, we first focus on building ensembles that model the structure of individual MTBRs. It is important to note, however, that we do not strive to model the structure of a given MTBR fragment alone in solution. Rather, our goal is to generate ensembles that model the range of conformations that a MTBR can adopt when it is part of full length tau. In the present study we focus on building ensembles for the second MTBR, henceforth referred to as MTBR2. This repeat is of particular interest because it contains both a six amino-acid repeat, PHF6&#x0002a;, which is a minimum interaction motif that can initiate tau aggregation in vitro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000155-vonBergen1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000155-vonBergen2">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, and the site of the proaggregatory mutation, &#x00394;K280, which is associated with some forms of frontotemporal dementia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000155-Rizzu1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000155-Khlistunova1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>We have developed a method, called energy-minima mapping and weighting (EMW), to construct ensembles that model the unfolded state of proteins. The underlying assumption that forms the basis of this approach is that the unfolded state can be modeled as a set of energetically favorable conformers, where each conformer corresponds to a local energy minimum. The method involves constructing a library of energetically favorable conformations and selecting conformations from this library to form ensembles that are consistent with a given set of experimental data. We use EMW to build ensembles for wild-type (WT) MTBR2 and the corresponding &#x00394;K280 mutant. By comparing data from the two sets of ensembles, we deduce structural preferences in the &#x00394;K280 ensemble that explain its increased propensity to form tau aggregates.</p></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><p>The EMW method begins by constructing sets of energetically favorable conformations for a sequence of amino-acids within a natively unfolded protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000155-g001">Figure 1</xref>). In the case of tau we focus on MTBR2 since this region contains the aggregation-initiating sequence PHF6&#x0002a; as well as the site of a mutation that is associated with increased tau aggregation in vitro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000155-Fischer1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. A set of local energy minima is then constructed for this subsequence, hence forming the candidate ensemble (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000155-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Associated with each structure in this ensemble is a weight, <italic>&#x003c9;<sub>i</sub></italic>, which corresponds to the probability that the given subsequence adopts the <italic>i</italic>th conformation in the candidate ensemble.

However, as sampling is performed on a relatively small subsequence these weights may not reflect the relative probabilities of different conformations when the subsequence is part of the larger protein. For example, compact states may be preferred over extended states when the subsequence is in isolation but not when part of tau. Therefore, the composition of the ensemble is optimized and the members of the candidate ensemble are reweighted in light of experimental data that is obtained on a larger segment of tau protein. Sampling small subsequences increases the chance that we will observe a relatively large number of accessible states for this system. Using experimental data obtained on a larger region of tau (and not just the subsequence of interest) helps to ensure that the calculated ensemble represents the local structure of the sequence as it appears within full length tau.</p><p>A central component of EMW is that we do not strive to construct a single model for the unfolded state. We recognize that the construction of unfolded ensembles that agree with any given set of experimental data is largely an underdetermined problem; hence it is likely that there are a number of different ensembles that are consistent with a given set of experimental data. Consequently, we constructed several ensembles that are all consistent with the experimental measurements and focused our analysis on local structural motifs that are present in all ensembles. For this study, we focused on NMR data that are available for <italic>both</italic> WT MTBR2 and a &#x00394;K280 mutant. These data were kindly provided by Marco Mukrasch, Daniela Fischer, and Markus Zweckstetter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000155-Fischer1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000155-Mukrasch1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Using the EMW method, 100 ensembles were constructed for both wild-type (WT) and &#x00394;K280 sequences of MTBR2 (a total of 200 ensembles). Each ensemble was constructed to minimize the difference between calculated <sup>13</sup>C&#x003b1; chemical shifts and the corresponding experimentally determined <sup>13</sup>C&#x003b1; chemical shifts. The number of structures in each ensemble corresponds to the minimal number of structures needed to fit the available chemical shifts. Preliminary calculations found that 15 conformers were needed; i.e., fewer structures resulted in worse fits to the <sup>13</sup>C&#x003b1; chemical shifts and more structures did not significantly improve the quality of fits. We note that other models examining residual structure in the unfolded state have utilized a similar number of representative conformers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000155-Dedmon1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Application of EMW yielded ensembles that were in excellent agreement with experimentally determined absolute <sup>13</sup>C&#x003b1; chemical shifts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000155-g002">Figure 2A and 2B</xref>). The average RMS error between the calculated <sup>13</sup>C&#x003b1; chemical shifts and the corresponding experimental values was 0.1 ppm&#x02014;well below the error associated with SHIFTX chemical shift predictions and similar to the error associated with experimental chemical shift measurements on K18 constructs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000155-Fischer1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000155-Neal1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. However, given that measured absolute chemical shifts for the 20 amino acids vary significantly according to the amino-acid type, reasonable correlations to absolute chemical shifts may be achieved by simply predicting amino-acid specific random coil values. Given this, we analyzed the relationship between the chemical shifts, after subtracting out residue-specific random coil chemical shift values; i.e., the secondary chemical shifts. Overall, there is excellent agreement between calculated secondary chemical shifts and the corresponding experimental values for each residue in the sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000155-g002">Figure 2C and 2D</xref>). These data demonstrate that the calculated models yield agreement with experiment on a per residue basis.</p><fig id="pcbi-1000155-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000155.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Model versus experimental absolute C&#x003b1; chemical shifts and C&#x003b1; secondary chemical shifts.</title><p>Model versus experimental absolute C&#x003b1; chemical shifts for (A) 100 WT ensembles and (B) 100 &#x00394;K280 ensembles are shown.

This helps to ensure that our models are not &#x0201c;overly fit&#x0201d; to the <sup>13</sup>C&#x003b1; chemical shifts. In general, a model that is over-fit to a given set of experimental data can reproduce that data remarkably well but cannot reproduce data that was not used to generate the model. Therefore we consider an ensemble to be validated if new experimental results can be accurately predicted from the ensemble. For both the WT and &#x00394;K280 sequences, each of the 100 ensembles was ranked based on its ability to predict <sup>13</sup>CO chemical shifts. Based on these data the thirty best ensembles were chosen for further analysis. The RMS difference between the calculated <sup>13</sup>CO chemical shifts and the corresponding experimental values are below 0.9 ppm; i.e., below the error associated with available chemical shift prediction algorithms (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000155-t001">Table 1</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000155-Neal1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>.

Since each of the 30 ensembles represents an independent representation of the unfolded state, we searched for local structural motifs that are found in all of the ensembles. More precisely, the existence of a local conformation that is consistently adopted by a given subsequence in MTBR2 suggests that this conformation is needed to reproduce the experimental results. We therefore consider conserved motifs to represent local conformational preferences.</p><fig id="pcbi-1000155-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000155.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>An alignment of structures from (A) all 30 WT ensembles and (B) all 30 &#x00394;K280 ensembles.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1000155.g003"/></fig><p>We begin with an assessment of the local conformation of PHF6&#x0002a; in both the WT and &#x00394;K280 ensembles. Since PHF6&#x0002a; in the WT sequence spans residues 275&#x02013;280, the &#x00394;K280 mutant sequence has a deletion in the six-residue stretch corresponding to PHF6&#x0002a;. However, since residue 281 is also a lysine, the &#x00394;K280 mutant contains an equivalent PHF6&#x0002a; subsequence at its N-terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000155-g004">Figure 4</xref>). This allows us to directly compare the conformation of PHF6&#x0002a; in both sequences. To identify preserved conformations of PHF6&#x0002a;, we first determined the different types of structures that this subsequence can adopt by clustering structures using only the backbone atoms of PHF6&#x0002a; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000155-g005">Figure 5</xref>). The probability that a given cluster occurs in an ensemble is equal to the sum of the weights of structures in that ensemble that contains a motif in the cluster. Preserved structural motifs are defined as clusters that have a nonzero weight in every ensemble (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000155-g005">Figure 5</xref>); i.e., a preserved motif is found in all ensembles. For comparison, we repeated this procedure for all contiguous six-residue subsequences within MTBR2, yielding a collection of approximately 300 clusters that represent all possible structural motifs in our ensembles that any six-residue sequence in MTBR2 can adopt. Using the criterion outlined above, roughly 5&#x00025; of these clusters were preserved across all ensembles.</p><fig id="pcbi-1000155-g004" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000155.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Aligned sequences of WT and &#x00394;K280 tau.</title><p>The PHF6&#x0002a; region is underlined in red.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pcbi.1000155.g004"/></fig><fig id="pcbi-1000155-g005" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000155.g005</object-id><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Outline of the method used for clustering local conformations.</title><p>First, a six-residue local region is selected for analysis.

A number of simulation methods have been developed to model the unfolded states of proteins and useful insights have been obtained with these techniques. Many of these approaches generate ensembles by directly incorporating experimental constraints into molecular dynamics simulations in order to facilitate conformational sampling. These methods bias molecular trajectories to sample conformers that are consistent with a given set of experimental data. One problematic issue with <italic>biased sampling</italic>, however, is that it can suffer from over-fitting&#x02014;a process that may yield a distribution of conformers that does not accurately model the range of structures that comprise the unfolded state <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000155-Vendruscolo1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. Given this concern, a number of <italic>unbiased</italic> methods have been developed to generate ensembles for unfolded proteins. These approaches utilize fast algorithms, which do not employ a physical potential energy function, to obtain representative structures of the unfolded state, and in some cases experimental data can then be used to improve the resulting ensembles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000155-Bernado1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000155-Feldman1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>.

Given that accurate modeling of an unfolded protein is an undetermined problem, it is likely that there are a number of different ensembles that agree with any given set of experimental data. Moreover, given the immense number of potential conformations that an unfolded protein can adopt, this may be true even when a relatively large number of experimental constraints are used to construct the ensemble. Hence our goal was to construct several candidate ensembles, each of which agrees with a given set of experimental constraints, and focus our analysis on local structural features that are preserved across all ensembles. Local structural features that are found in all independent ensembles likely represent motifs that are required to reproduce the experimental data. In other words, given the underdetermined nature of the problem, it is not clear how to determine when one has the &#x0201c;correct&#x0201d; ensemble. However, local structural motifs that consistently appear in all independent ensembles are likely to also be present in the &#x0201c;correct&#x0201d; ensemble. Consequently, we consider locally preserved structural motifs to represent local conformational preferences.</p><p>An important consideration in our method is the choice of experimental data that is used to build and validate the constructed ensembles. In principle, EMW can use any set of experimental measurements to optimize and validate model ensembles. Indeed, as more structural information is made available, additional data can and should be used to further refine the set of model ensembles. In this regard, we note that although a number of NMR measurements have been made on native tau constructs, the data available for constructs containing a &#x00394;K280 mutation is relatively limited. In a prior study, nuclear chemical shifts and HSQC spectra were measured for the K18&#x00394;K280 construct, which contains all four MTBRs and the &#x00394;K280 mutation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000155-Fischer1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Data were obtained for both free K18&#x00394;K280 and for K18&#x00394;K280 in the presence of the polyanion heparin and microtubules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000155-Fischer1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. However, as we are interested in building structural models for MTBR2 in solutions free of compounds that promote tau self-association (e.g., heparin) and free of proteins known to bind tau, we focused on measurements obtained with the free K18&#x00394;K280 construct. Additionally, as there are a number of existing methods that relate chemical shift measurements to three dimensional protein structures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000155-Neal1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000155-Marx1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000155-Xu1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref> we considered <sup>13</sup>C&#x003b1;, <sup>13</sup>CO, <sup>1</sup>HN, and <sup>15</sup>N chemical shift measurements; i.e., the only available chemical shifts for K18&#x00394;K280 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000155-Fischer1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>.

Nevertheless, we suggest that the combination of a physical potential energy function, which can in principle model long range interactions, and experimentally determined chemical shifts can provide insight into the structure of proteins in general. In this regard we note that data are emerging that suggest that backbone chemical shifts, when used in conjunction with a physical energy function, may be sufficient to adequately predict tertiary folds, and consequently stable non-local contacts, for some proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000155-Cavalli1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000155-Gong1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Although our work focuses on the structure of the MTBR2 without explicitly including other MTBRs, our findings may also have implications for full length tau.

This helps to guarantee that the ensemble models the structure of MTBR2 as it appears in full length tau. In short, we are not interested in the structure of MTR2 as it appears alone in solution; instead we hope to deduce structural features of MTBR2 as it appears in full length tau.

Therefore it is likely that an inherent propensity to form extended conformations, that are consistent with &#x003b2;-structure, will promote aggregation in natively unfolded systems. When EMW is applied to MTBR2, we find that the aggregation-initiating sequence, PHF6&#x0002a;, adopts an extended conformation in both the WT and &#x00394;K280 ensembles, a finding consistent with the observation that these peptides can initiate tau aggregation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000155-vonBergen1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000155-vonBergen2">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>.

The present study suggests that this property is preserved when aggregation-initiating sequences are part of their corresponding MTBRs. That is, PHF6&#x0002a; a priori adopts extended conformations that can readily form hydrogen-bonded &#x003b2;-structure. Additionally, a recent survey of amyloidogenic proteins suggests that fibrillogenesis for natively unfolded proteins involve the formation of partially folded intermediates that can subsequently go on to form amyloid fibrils <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000155-Uversky1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>.

However, early characterizations of MTBRs in nonorganic solvents, found that the PHF6 region likely has a higher propensity for extended, &#x003b2;-strand-like conformations&#x02014;a finding in accord with our data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000155-Mukrasch1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000155-Eliezer1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Given that both WT and &#x00394;K280 tau contain aggregation-initiating sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000155-g004">Figure 4</xref>), it is not clear how &#x003b2;-strand propensity in this region explains the difference in aggregation potential between the two sequences. Therefore to deduce structural features of the &#x00394;K280 mutant that explain its proclivity to form aggregates, we analyzed the structure of MTBR2 in the vicinity of the mutation site. Unfolded ensembles of WT MTBR2 contain two conformations at the mutation site that were present in all ensembles&#x02014;a loop/turn conformation and an extended state. In contrast to the WT MTBR2 ensembles, models of &#x00394;K280 in the same region had one conformation that was present in all ensembles. This state is relatively extended and contains a kink at the site of the deletion. While the slight disruption in the extended state of the mutant may also influence the ability to form hydrogen-bonded cross-&#x003b2;-structure, a loop/turn at the C-terminus of PHF6&#x0002a; constitutes a much greater impediment to the formation of &#x003b2;-structure. Since residue K280 has a relative preference for nonextended states, deletion of this residue leads to increased sampling of extended states downstream from PHF6&#x0002a;. The relative preference for extended structures downstream from PHF6&#x0002a; in the &#x00394;K280 mutant suggests that the ability to propagate &#x003b2;-structure distal to PHF6&#x0002a; can affect the aggregation potential of tau. These observations therefore explain how the deletion of a single residue can change the aggregation potential of tau.</p><p>We also find that in both WT and mutant ensembles residue S285 can adopt &#x003d5;, &#x003c8; angles consistent with an &#x003b1;-helical/turn structure. Recent data on the WT sequence are also consistent with these observations as RDC values and molecular dynamics simulations suggest that S285 adopts an &#x003b1;-helical/turn structure. Since those experiments were performed in polyacrylamide gel, our data suggest that this structure also occurs with relatively high frequency in solution. It is also worthwhile to note that although we find that a six-residue region including K280 can adopt a similar loop/turn conformation, the associated RDCs for this region are not associated with a change in sign, like that observed at S285 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000155-Vendruscolo1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. Nonetheless, unlike RDC measurements for folded proteins, RDC values for unfolded proteins can be difficult to interpret <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000155-Louhivuori2">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>. This is due, in part, to the fact that prior to the measurement of RDC values, the protein of interest must first be embedded in an alignment medium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000155-Louhivuori1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. This induced steric alignment of unfolded proteins may lead to results that do not fully capture the range of structures that an unfolded protein can adopt in solution. Hence the absence of particular RDC values in polyacrylamide gel (or any other alignment media) does not necessarily imply that a given conformation is not present in solutions containing the unfolded protein of interest.</p><p>The formation of tau aggregates is likely a complex process as a number of factors have been shown to influence the formation of tau aggregates in vitro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000155-Selkoe1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000155-Drewes1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Consequently, there may be additional factors that contribute to the increased ability of the &#x00394;K280 mutant to form aggregates; e.g., a &#x00394;K280 mutation leads to an overall decrease in the strength of the intermolecular charge-charge repulsion between tau monomers that self-associate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000155-vonBergen2">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Nonetheless, our data demonstrate that small changes in the sequence of tau can lead to localized structural changes in the unfolded ensemble that may affect tau's ability to form cross-&#x003b2;-structure. Overall, our data suggest that small sequence-specific changes can promote tau aggregation and that interventions that prevent the propagation of &#x003b2;-structure downstream from aggregation-initiating sequences, may form the basis for therapies that prevent tau aggregation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s5"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s5a"><title>Energy-Minima Mapping and Weighting</title><p>The EMW method constructs ensembles for unfolded proteins that are consistent with a given set of experimental data.

Conformational sampling uses high temperature molecular dynamics (MD) followed by minimization of the resulting structures (i.e., quenched dynamics) to create a library of widely varying conformations representing minima on the potential energy surface. Model optimization is performed to select a subset of these structures and optimize weights that represent the relative prevalence of each structure. Validation is performed by computing additional chemical shifts that not used to construct the ensemble and comparing these data to experimentally measured carbonyl carbon shifts.

This sampling procedure consisted of high temperature molecular dynamics (used to randomize the initial conformation of the protein) followed by quenched dynamics. To ensure that a wide range of conformations was sampled, constraints were imposed on the peptide for the high temperature and quenching steps. Specifically, conformational sampling was performed in a series of molecular dynamics simulations. In each simulation the end-to-end distance of MTBR2 was restrained to a pre-defined value; i.e., 3, 4, 5, &#x02026;, 70 &#x000c5;, where the end-to-end distance was defined as the distance between the C&#x003b1; carbons on residue VAL1 and SER31 of the peptide. End-to-end restraints were used to ensure that both compact and extended states were sampled during the high temperature simulations. For each end-to-end distance, 4 ns of high temperature MD at 1,000 K was performed with the EEF1 implicit model of solvent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000155-Lazaridis1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>.

Coordinates were saved every 10 ps, yielding a total of 400 structures per end-to-end distance. This procedure was applied to both WT and &#x00394;K280 sequences, producing a total of 27,200 structures for each sequence.</p><p>Each structure was then used to initiate a new MD trajectory which cools the system to 298 K over 40 ps of simulation by coupling the sampled system (including atom coordinates and corresponding velocities) to a Berendsen heat bath at 298 K.

Restraints were removed for the minimization step to ensure that minima on the unbiased energy surface are sampled. Searching for minima in the vicinity of the randomized conformation by cooling and equilibration followed by minimization rather than simply performing direct minimization allows the structures to escape shallow local energy minima and find more stable states.</p><p>As the conformation of PHF6&#x0002a; is of particular importance, additional simulations were performed to ensure that a large range of PHF6&#x0002a; conformations were represented in the ensembles.
