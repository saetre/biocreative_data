The YefM&#x02013;YoeB TA complex of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> consists of YoeB toxin that is counteracted by YefM antitoxin. When liberated from the complex, YoeB acts as an endoribonuclease, preferentially cleaving 3&#x02032; of purine nucleotides. Here we demonstrate that <italic>yefM-yoeB</italic> is transcriptionally autoregulated. YefM, a dimeric protein with extensive secondary structure revealed by circular dichroism (CD) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, is the primary repressor, whereas YoeB is a repression enhancer. The operator site 5&#x02032; of <italic>yefM-yoeB</italic> comprises adjacent long and short palindromes with core 5&#x02032;-TGTACA-3&#x02032; motifs. YefM binds the long palindrome, followed sequentially by short palindrome recognition. In contrast, the repressor&#x02013;corepressor complex recognizes both motifs more avidly, impyling that YefM within the complex has an enhanced DNA-binding affinity compared to free YefM. Operator interaction by YefM and YefM&#x02013;YoeB is accompanied by structural transitions in the proteins. Paired 5&#x02032;-TGTACA-3&#x02032; motifs are common in <italic>yefM-yoeB</italic> regulatory regions in diverse genomes suggesting that interaction of YefM&#x02013;YoeB with these motifs is a conserved mechanism of operon autoregulation. Artificial perturbation of transcriptional autorepression could elicit inappropriate YoeB toxin production and induction of bacterial cell suicide, a potentially novel antibacterial strategy.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Bacteria populate and thrive in remarkably diverse environmental conditions and ecological niches. However, bacterial species may need to adapt rapidly to dramatic changes in nutritional or physiological circumstances. For example, intestinal bacteria must adjust to cycles of nutriment excess and starvation, and soil and other microorganisms may need to cope with oscillating periods of dessication and hydration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>). Moreover, when passaging between exponential growth and stationary phase, the production of diverse macromolecules and cell components decelerates at different rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>). Furthermore, bacteria generally exist as multicellular colonies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>) or as biofilms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>). Within these microenvironments, intercellular signalling and coordinated multicellular processes are mediated by quorum-sensing mechanisms that regulate a diverse array of physiological activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>). Even at the colonial level bacteria maintain discrete, ordered spatial structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>).</p><p>The concept that bacteria possess programmed cell death or cell cycle arrest mechanisms that interconnect with complex physiological networks and multicellular organization has emerged relatively recently, but has been validated by observations that the genome of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> K12, for example, harbours a number of toxin&#x02013;antitoxin (TA) modules. These modules are involved in the response to nutrient deprivation or other stresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). Other bacterial genomes also contain multiple putative TA cassettes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>). Remarkably, some bacteria harbour 10s of TA modules, including some species that possess &#x0003e;40 distinct TA loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>). These modules are organized similarly and are homologous to TA cassettes that promote plasmid maintenance by post-segregational killing of plasmid-free cells, indicating extensive module transfer between plasmid and chromosome genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). In plasmid-specified complexes, the antitoxin is more susceptible to host proteases than is the toxin. When a plasmid-free cell arises the toxin is liberated from its tight interaction with depleted antitoxin and targets an essential intracellular host factor to cause cell death or severe growth impairment. Chromosomal TA activity in bacteria might be triggered in response to starvation conditions, bacteriophage infection exposure to antimicrobial agents, DNA damage and other physiological stresses. Under these circumstances it may be beneficial to the community to sacrifice a portion of the cells within it so that a sub-population can persist, perhaps even cannabilizing nutrients that dead cells have released (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>). Alternatively, by acting as reversible cell cycle arrest agents, TA factors might allow cells to enter a dormant or semidormant state as a protection against temporary nutrient limitation and to revive when physiological conditions become more conducive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>).</p><p>The two most well characterized chromosomal TA factors are RelBE and MazEF of <italic>E.coli</italic>. RelE toxin is a global inhibitor of translation that is activated during amino acid starvation but which is otherwise counteracted by RelB antitoxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>). RelE is an endoribonuclease that, although it does not degrade free RNA, cleaves mRNA in the ribosomal A site with high-codon specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>). Production of the MazEF proteins is regulated by the alarmone guanosine-3&#x02032;5&#x02032;-bispyrophosphate (ppGpp) that is synthesized by RelA protein under conditions of amino acid starvation. Moreover, overproduction of ppGpp induces MazEF-mediated cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). MazF, like RelE, is an endoribonuclease that cleaves mRNA site-specifically, although without a requirement that the mRNA be associated with the ribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>). MazEF, like RelBE, might be responsible for death in starving cultures of <italic>E.coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>). Cell death mediated by MazEF can also be triggered by several antibiotics that are general inhibitors of transcription and/or translation. In contrast, it has been proposed that the MazF toxin does not induce cell killing, but instead is a bacteriostatic agent from which cells can recover when more conducive conditions prevail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>).</p><p>Pomerantsev <italic>et al.</italic> first proposed that <italic>yefM-yoeB</italic> in <italic>E.coli</italic> specified a TA complex, based on homology between YefM and the Phd antitoxin encoded by bacteriophage P1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). YefM&#x02013;YoeB was subsequently shown to be a functional TA related to the Axe&#x02013;Txe complex encoded by enterococcal, multidrug resistance plasmid pRUM, and that YefM&#x02013;YoeB homologues are widely-distributed on bacterial genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). The YefM antitoxin forms a heterotrimeric complex with the YoeB toxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). YoeB is an endoribonuclease, like RelE and MazF, cleaving preferentially at the 3&#x02032; side of adenine and guanine nucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>). Overproduction of Lon ATP-dependent protease specifically activates this cleavage. This probably occurs due to the liberation of YoeB from its tight association with YefM, the latter failing to be replenished due to Lon-mediated translation inhibition of a YoeB-independent pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>). Interestingly, the <italic>yefM</italic> gene is upregulated during growth of <italic>E.coli</italic> in biofilms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>).</p><p>The tertiary structures of YoeB and the YefM<sub>2</sub>&#x02013;YoeB complex have recently been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). One of the C-termini in the YefM homodimer is unstructured, whereas the other C-terminus adopts an &#x003b1;-helical conformation within the heterotrimeric complex and conceals the atypical ribonuclease fold of YoeB. The N-terminal regions of YefM form a symmetrical dimer within the YefM<sub>2</sub>&#x02013;YoeB complex and do not contact YoeB directly in the crystal structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>), although the YefM recognition determinant that interacts most strongly with YoeB was previously mapped to the N-terminal segment of the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>). The three residues at the C-terminal tip of YoeB that form part of the atypical endoribonucleolytic fold are rearranged into a less favourable conformation when in complex with the YefM dimer, partly explaining the mechanism by which the antitoxin blocks the toxic activity of YoeB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>).</p><p>Controlled activation of the toxin factor is paramount to the function of TA complexes. Transcriptional autoregulation of TA cassettes is one level at which this control is exerted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>). Here we dissect the role of the YefM&#x02013;YoeB complex in modulating its own synthesis: YefM is the primary transcriptional repressor of the <italic>yefM-yoeB</italic> cassette, with YoeB acting as a repression enhancer. DNA binding is achieved by the association of the proteins with a pair of palindromes that comprise the <italic>yefM-yoeB</italic> operator site. Understanding the molecular basis of <italic>yefM-yoeB</italic> regulation may suggest strategies for perturbing this control, leading to the production of excess intracellular toxin and therefore controlled bacterial cell suicide.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Strains</title><p><italic>E.coli</italic> DH5&#x003b1; was used for plasmid construction and RNA isolation, BL21(DE3) for recombinant YefM and YefM&#x02013;YoeB overproduction, and SC301467 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>) for &#x003b2;-galactosidase assays.

However, primer extension analysis performed here unambiguously delineated the <italic>in vivo</italic> transcription start point to a position three nucleotides 3&#x02032; of that previously assessed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Sequences with close matches to consensus &#x02212;10 and &#x02212;35 hexamer promoter boxes, and which are separated by an optimal 17 bp, are located 5&#x02032; of this transcription start point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The discrepancy between the primer extension analysis here and previous transcript sequencing experiments might reflect differences in transcription start site selectivity <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>, or 5&#x02032; end processing of the <italic>in vivo</italic> transcript which is absent <italic>in vitro</italic>. Nevertheless, both datasets strongly indicate that the first position in the <italic>yefM</italic> translational start codon is at position +21, and not at another potential start codon at &#x02212;7 as suggested previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The region 5&#x02032; of position +21 also possesses a sequence that resembles a ribosome binding site separated by a window of 6 bp from the putative <italic>yefM</italic> ATG initiation codon. These observations agree with findings that overexpressed <italic>yefM</italic> which includes the potential start codon at &#x02212;7 to &#x02212;5 produces a translation product that commences at position +21 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>).</p><p>A 99 bp fragment encompassing the <italic>yefM-yoeB</italic> promoter and <italic>yefM</italic> start codon was inserted upstream of a promoterless <italic>lac</italic> operon in the transcription fusion vector pRS415. This fusion produced 4099 &#x000b1; 547 U of &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity in strain SC301467, which is deleted of chromosomal <italic>yefM-yoeB</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>), whereas pRS415 alone produced &#x0003c;100 units. Thus, the region 5&#x02032; of <italic>yefM-yoeB</italic> possesses substantial promoter activity. Subsequently, YefM protein was provided in trans from an arabinose-inducible promoter, and its effect on &#x003b2;-galactosidase production by the <italic>yefM&#x02013;lacZ</italic> fusion was examined: &#x003b2;-galactosidase levels were reduced &#x0223c;5.5-fold to 739 &#x000b1; 164 U in the presence of YefM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Moreover, coexpression of <italic>yefM-yoeB</italic> in trans further reduced &#x003b2;-galacosidase levels to background levels (126 &#x000b1; 33 U). Thus, YefM is a transcriptional autorepressor of the <italic>yefM-yoeB</italic> promoter, with YoeB acting as a corepressor.</p></sec><sec><title>YefM and YefM&#x02013;YoeB recognize DNA palindromes with common core sequences</title><p>Three versions of YefM were purified to &#x0003e;95% homogeneity and tested in EMSA with a 99 bp double-stranded oligonucleotide substrate encompassing the <italic>yefM-yoeB</italic> promoter region: native YefM isolated following cleavage from a fusion of the C-terminus of the protein to the N-terminus of an intein tag; YefM with a hexahistidine tag at its C-terminus (YefM-His<sub>6</sub>); and YefM with a 21 amino acid extension, including a decahistidine tag, at its N-terminus (His<sub>10</sub>-YefM). Native YefM weakly bound the 99 bp oligonucleotide, producing a single-retarded complex in EMSA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Although complex formation apparently was inefficient, the interaction of YefM with the <italic>yefM-yoeB</italic> promoter region was specific as no retarded species were observed in EMSA with an unrelated substrate. Similar DNA binding patterns were observed with YefM-His<sub>6</sub> (data not shown) indicating that the C-terminal tag does not detectably impede interaction of YefM with DNA. In contrast, His<sub>10</sub>-YefM produced a smear of higher molecular weight complexes with the 99 bp oligonucleotide suggesting that the N-terminal tag significantly altered the association of YefM with DNA (data not shown). This observation correlates with the suggestion that a conserved basic patch in the N-terminal domain of YefM might be involved in DNA recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>).</p><p>The 3&#x02032; end of <italic>yefM</italic> overlaps the 5&#x02032; of <italic>yoeB</italic> by 1 bp. These overlapping genes were cloned in an expression vector to permit purification of a YefM&#x02013;YoeB&#x02013;His<sub>6</sub> complex in which the two proteins are present at a physiological ratio. The YefM-YoeB-His<sub>6</sub> complex produced a major retarded species at &#x0003e;200-fold lower protein concentrations than that generated by YefM alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Furthermore, at YefM&#x02013;YoeB concentrations &#x0003e;12 nM, &#x0003e;90% of the substrate was bound into nucleoprotein complex(es), in contrast with YefM alone which retarded &#x0003c;1% of the substrate at this concentration. The nucleoprotein complex formed by YefM&#x02013;YoeB&#x02013;His<sub>6</sub> migrated slightly more slowly in EMSA than that produced by YefM suggesting that the former incorporates a greater number of protein protomers than the latter and/or that the conformation of the DNA in the complexes differ.</p><p>YoeB protein was purified as a hexahistidine-tagged (YoeB&#x02013;His<sub>6</sub>) version from the YefM&#x02013;YoeB&#x02013;His<sub>6</sub> complex, as well as in native form from the His<sub>10</sub>&#x02013;YefM&#x02013;YoeB complex. Neither version of YoeB generated a shifted complex with the <italic>yefM-yoeB</italic> promoter DNA in EMSA revealing that the protein apparently does not bind directly to DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Mixing experiments in which native, untagged YefM and YoeB were preincubated in different ratios and subsequently used in binding experiments with the 99 bp double-stranded oligonucleotide showed that the reconstituted YefM&#x02013;YoeB complex produced a major retarded species with migration analogous to that observed with the YefM&#x02013;YoeB&#x02013;His<sub>6</sub> complex. Thus, co-purified and reconstructed YefM&#x02013;YoeB complexes exhibit similar DNA binding properties. Finally, the optimal YefM:YoeB ratio at which complete DNA binding was observed was between 1:2 and 2:1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). This correlates with biophysical and structural studies which demonstrated that purified YefM&#x02013;YoeB complex consisted of either a 1:2 or 2:1 mix of the two proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>).</p><p>The binding sites for YefM and YefM&#x02013;YoeB&#x02013;His<sub>6</sub> in the <italic>yefM-yoeB</italic> promoter region were localized by DNase I footprinting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). YefM first specifically protected the region between &#x02212;17 and &#x02212;3 on the upper strand from DNase I digestion, with an extended footprint between &#x02212;2 and +12 at higher protein concentrations. Protection of the bottom strand was staggered by 3 or 4 nt in the 3&#x02032;&#x02009;direction with protection initially occurring from &#x02212;21 to &#x02212;6 and then between &#x02212;5 and +8. The observed 3&#x02032;-stagger potentially reflects minor groove coverage at these ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>). Position &#x02212;14 on the lower strand is hypersensitive to DNase I cleavage in the presence of YefM indicating that the DNA structure is perturbed at this point. The extent of protection on both strands by the YefM&#x02013;YoeB&#x02013;His<sub>6</sub> complex was indistinguisable from that provided by YefM alone at higher protein concentration. However, protection against DNase I digestion by YefM&#x02013;YoeB-His<sub>6</sub> occurred at &#x0223c;100-fold lower protein concentration than by YefM, assuming a 2:1 ratio of YefM:YoeB. In addition, the enhancement at position &#x02212;14 on the bottom strand was more pronounced in the presence of YefM&#x02013;YoeB&#x02013;His<sub>6</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The DNase I footprinting results agree with EMSA data demonstrating that the <italic>yefM-yoeB</italic> promoter region is bound more avidly by the two-protein complex than by YefM alone.</p><p>The YefM and YefM&#x02013;YoeB&#x02013;His<sub>6</sub> DNase I footprints cover the &#x02212;10 hexamer promoter box as well as 3&#x02032; and 5&#x02032; flanking regions, suggesting that the proteins inhibit transcription by blocking the access of RNA polymerase to the <italic>yefM-yoeB</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>). The primary region protected by YefM against DNase I attack includes a 5&#x02032;-TCATTGTACAATGA-3&#x02032; palindrome (L [long] repeat). The 5&#x02032;-TGTACA-3&#x02032; core of this inverted repeat is also present in the secondary region of YefM protection (S [short] repeat) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Preferential binding of YefM to the L repeat might be facilitated by the additional palindromic nucleotides that flank the hexameric core sequence within this repeat, but that are absent from the S repeat. In summary, the operator site for <italic>yefM-yoeB</italic> autoregulation encompasses a pair of palindromic sequences that possess a common 5&#x02032;-TGTACA-3&#x02032; core with a centre-to-centre distance of 12 bp.</p></sec><sec><title>The S repeat plays a crucial role in transcriptional repression and DNA binding by YefM&#x02013;YoeB</title><p>Multiple substitution mutations were introduced into the S repeat in the operator site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) to assess the contribution of this motif to regulation of <italic>yefM-yoeB</italic> expression. Disruption of the S repeat did not detectably perturb either unregulated expression from the resulting <italic>yefM(S&#x02032;)-lacZ</italic> fusion or repression of this fusion by YefM <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). However, the YefM&#x02013;YoeB complex failed to exert additional downregulation of the <italic>yefM(S&#x02032;)-lacZ</italic> fusion, which was observed with the wild-type <italic>yefM&#x02013;lacZ</italic> fusion. Indeed, YefM&#x02013;YoeB reproducibly repressed the <italic>yefM(S&#x02032;)&#x02013;lacZ</italic> fusion slightly less efficiently than did YefM alone. Interactions between YefM&#x02013;YoeB complexes assembled at the L and S repeats might be sufficiently perturbed by mutation of the S palindrome that cooperativity is weakened resulting in reduced binding of the complex to the palindromes. In accord with the <italic>in vivo</italic> results, both the weak binding by YefM and the more proficient interaction of YefM&#x02013;YoeB&#x02013;His<sub>6</sub> with a substrate encompassing the <italic>yefM-yoeB</italic> promoter region <italic>in vitro</italic> were abolished with an analogous 99 bp double-stranded oligonucleotide harbouring the S repeat mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). In combination, these results emphasize that the S repeat is critical for association of the YefM&#x02013;YoeB complex with the <italic>yefM-yoeB</italic> operator site, and that its disruption dramatically impairs the interaction of the protein complex with the site.</p></sec><sec><title>YefM possesses extensive secondary structure</title><p>CD analysis suggested that YefM is an unfolded protein that entirely lacks secondary structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>). However, native YefM purified here exhibited distinct CD minima at &#x0223c;208 and &#x0223c;222 nm that are characteristic of &#x003b1;-helix content and helix&#x02013;helix interactions, respectively, and which indicate that the protein was at least partly folded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The relatively shallow peak at 222 nm in comparison with the deeper trough at 208 nm implies that the protein lacks extensive coiled-coil formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>). Deconvolution of the data with CDSSTR software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>) suggested that the &#x003b1;-helical content of YefM was &#x0223c;40%, with &#x0223c;30% &#x003b2;-strands, 5&#x02013;10% turns, and the remainder unordered. Analogous results were obtained with His<sub>10</sub>-YefM (data not shown). The recently-described tertiary structure of the YefM&#x02013;YoeB heterotrimeric complex consists of one YoeB monomer associated with a YefM homodimer. The YefM homodimer is asymmetric with one of the YefM monomers possessing a disordered C-terminal region, whereas the equivalent region of the second monomer is folded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). The &#x003b1;-helical content of the asymmetric YefM homodimer within the complex was 45%, with 20% &#x003b2;-strands, 18% turns and 17% disordered: these values are not dissimilar to those obtained from CD studies of YefM here. In the absence of high-resolution information about the tertiary structure of free YefM, it remains to be clarified whether YefM undergoes structural transitions between its free state and when associated with YoeB, although this seems likely.</p><p>In view of the inconsistency between the CD spectra for YefM observed here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) and those described recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>), NMR spectra were acquired to provide another assessment of the protein's conformational state. The 1D spectrum of YefM-His<sub>6</sub> is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and the 2D NOESY in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. Close examination of the spectra reveals a mixture of resonances in which well-dispersed signals are superimposed upon resonances that are clustered together; these characteristics are clearly seen in the amide and methyl proton regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). In addition, resonances are also observed in the region just downfield of the water resonance, these being typically from residues in &#x003b2;-strands. The 2D NOESY spectra showed cross-peaks which are indicative of secondary structures: cross-peaks between amide protons suggest the presence of helices, cross peaks between amide protons and alpha protons downfield of 5 p.p.m. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) indicate the presence of &#x003b2;-strands. The NOESY peaks between the upfield methyl protons and downfield amide and aromatic protons additionally suggest the presence of tertiary structures. Therefore, the NMR data show that the recombinant YefM-His<sub>6</sub> used in the present studies has secondary and tertiary structures. A series of spectra were collected at increasing temperatures from 15 to 30&#x000b0;C. Apart from systematic shifts due to temperature variation and a general decreased in linewidths resulting from the faster tumbling of the protein in solution at higher temparatures, the spectra of YefM-His<sub>6</sub> remained essentially the same, with little signs of thermal unfolding; this is further evidence that YefM-His<sub>6</sub> adopts a somewhat stable conformation within this temperature range. Overall, the NMR data suggests that the YefM protein exists either as a mixture of folded and unfolded states, or that the protein has folded and unfolded regions in its tertiary structure.</p><p>Further investigations into these options were carried out using CD by examination of the temperature dependence of ellipticity at 222 nm in 0.2&#x000b0;C steps over the range 5&#x02013;80&#x000b0;C at a heating rate of 1&#x000b0;C/min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). The protein showed a gradual melting transition and dimunition of the CD signal indicating a non-cooperative unfolding process, again reflective either of a mobile, partially unfolded protein and/or that YefM exists in a variety of folded states. The midpoint of the denaturation curve revealed a melting temperature (<italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub>) of &#x0223c;45&#x000b0;C. No visible precipitation of the protein sample was apparent at 80&#x000b0;C. When the sample was cooled gradually to 5&#x000b0;C and monitored by CD ellipticity at 222 nm, a pattern very similar in reverse to that of the denaturation profile was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Moreover, the CD spectra of native and renatured YefM were virtually indistinguishable indicating that heat denaturation of native YefM is fully reversible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). The CD spectrum of YefM&#x02013;YoeB&#x02013;His<sub>6</sub> observed here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) is similar to that described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>), as is the complex's thermal denaturation curve over the range 5&#x02013;80&#x000b0;C which confirms a pronounced <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> at &#x0223c;60&#x000b0;C, and lack of renaturation following heating to 80&#x000b0;C (data not shown).</p><p>CD spectra in the near- and far-UV regions can be used to discriminate between DNA and protein within a nucleoprotein complex as the far UV region of the spectrum is dominated by contributions of amide moieties from the peptide backbone, whereas secondary structure alterations in nucleic acids upon formation of the nucleoprotein complex are evident in the non-overlapping region from 240 to 320 nm. This distinction was used to assess whether YefM or YefM-YoeB-His<sub>6</sub> underwent detectable structural changes when bound to operator DNA, and vice versa. To allow comparison of protein spectra free and in the DNA bound state, the contribution of the DNA was subtracted from the curves. Conversely, any contribution of the protein in the 240&#x02013;320 nm region was subtracted separately to allow assessment of spectral alterations indicative of changes in DNA when complexed with protein. Using a 5:1 molar concentration of YefM and a 99 bp DNA fragment encompassing the operator site, the CD minima at 208 and 222 nm became more pronounced than in the absence of DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). An equivalent DNA fragment harbouring mutations in the S repeat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) induced less profound alterations in the far UV region, whereas YefM spectra in the presence and absence of a DNA fragment without a YefM recognition site were indistinguishable. The results suggest that YefM undergoes structural transitions when bound to DNA, and that the alterations are induced specifically by its cognate binding site. Analogous CD results were noted for YefM-YoeB-His<sub>6</sub> in the absence and presence of the three different DNA fragments, except that the fragment containing S repeat mutations elicited a weaker response with YefM-YoeB-His<sub>6</sub> than with YefM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).</p><p>B-form DNA presents a typical positive CD maximum centred at 275 nm, a minimum near 245 nm, with a zero point transition around 258 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>). The <italic>yefM-yoeB</italic> operator DNA showed no significant alterations in these characteristics in the presence YefM or YefM-YoeB-His<sub>6</sub> (data not shown), suggesting that the operator site does not undergo major structural transitions when bound by its cognate proteins.</p></sec><sec><title>YefM is dimeric in solution</title><p>Cross-linking experiments with DMP were performed to characterize the oligomeric state of native YefM (9.3 kDa). Although predominantly monomeric, a species with the molecular mass of a dimer was frequently evident in untreated samples analysed by SDS&#x02013;PAGE. Moreover, a significant fraction of YefM was rapidly fixed into covalently bound dimers with 10 mM DMP at 22&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Similar results were noted with DMP concentrations as low as 0.1 mM (data not shown). These results demonstrate that YefM forms dimers in solution. In the case of YefM-YoeB-His<sub>6</sub> (29.9 kDa), DMP cross-linking produced a &#x0223c;22 kDa species that is likely to be dimeric YefM, and a doublet at &#x0223c;30 kDa that correlates with a trimeric YefM&#x02013;YoeB&#x02013;His<sub>6</sub> complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), as noted previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>).</p><p>YefM eluted predominantly (&#x0003e;98%) as a single peak in size exclusion chromatography on a Superdex 75 10/30 column.

Thus, both cross-linking and MALS studies conclusively demonstrated that YefM is a dimer in solution. Moreover, the hydrodynamic radius of native YefM determined by QELS performed in parallel with MALS was 2.6 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). This is relatively elongated for a molecule of this size suggesting that unstructured regions might contribute to the protein's extended conformation, in agreement with CD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) and NMR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>) results.</p></sec><sec><title>Paired L and S palindromes in <italic>yefM-yoeB</italic> regulatory regions in diverse genomes</title><p>Homologues of <italic>yefM</italic>-<italic>yoeB</italic> are widely disseminated in bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). To assess whether L and S palindromes might also be implicated in transcriptional autoregulation of these homologues, the regions upstream of the cassettes in diverse genomes were scrutinized for the presence of 5&#x02032;-TGTACA-3&#x02032; motifs with a centre-to-centre distance of 12 bp, as in <italic>E.coli</italic> K-12. Many <italic>yefM-yoeB</italic> genes were accompanied by paired 5&#x02032;-TGTACA-3&#x02032; boxes within 80 bp of the <italic>yefM</italic> translational start codon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Palindromicity in the more 5&#x02032; motif often extended beyond the core hexamer sequence, analogous to the L repeat in strain K-12. Although the paired hexamer boxes were consistently separated by 6 bp, the sequences of the spacers were relatively diverse, as were both the sequences between the S repeat and the translational start, and 5&#x02032; of the L repeat. Although paired L and S palindromes are embedded within the regulatory regions of numerous <italic>yefM-yoeB</italic> operons, many of the genomes that were analysed did not harbor 5&#x02032;-TGTACA-3&#x02032; motifs upstream of their <italic>yefM-yoeB</italic> genes suggesting that YefM&#x02013;YoeB complexes in these bacteria recognize different regulatory motifs, or that regulation occurs by mechanisms that do not involve YefM&#x02013;YoeB.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The toxin components of TA systems are intracellular molecular time bombs whose release from complexes with their cognate antitoxins can trigger bacterial programmed cell death or cell cycle arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). Understanding the mechanisms by which expression and activation of these toxins are controlled could allow the development of artificial means for toxin detonation, and therefore novel antibacterial strategies. For example, chemical genetics approaches may reveal innovative antibiosis strategies based on small molecule perturbation of TA module expression. Among chromosomal TA operons that have been analysed in <italic>E.coli</italic>, transcriptional autoregulation has been demonstrated for the <italic>relBE</italic> and <italic>mazEF</italic> modules. In both cases, the antitoxin acts as the primary repressor and the toxin as a co-repressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>), which are also features of plasmid TA complexes. The chromosomal <italic>chpBI-chpBK</italic> TA operon is also autoregulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>). Among chromosomal systems, regulation of the <italic>mazEF</italic> operon has been examined most closely: repression involves binding of the MazE antitoxin&#x02013;MazF toxin complex to two alternating palindromes that overlap a pair of promoters that drive <italic>mazEF</italic> expression. Factor for inversion stimulation (FIS) weakly activates <italic>mazEF</italic> by interacting with sequences 5&#x02032; of the palindromes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>). In comparison, the <italic>yefM-yoeB</italic> operator site consists of L and S palindromes that possess a common hexameric core motif. The YefM antitoxin is the major transcriptional autoregulator of the operon, preferentially recognizing the L palindrome followed by the S repeat at elevated protein concentrations <italic>in vitro</italic>. Dimerization of YefM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) probably reflects its interaction with these palindromic DNA sites, and suggests that the YefM<sub>2</sub>&#x02013;YoeB heterotrimer observed in crystallographic studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>) is more likely to represent the repressor&#x02013;corepressor complex for transcriptional regulation than the YefM&#x02013;YoeB<sub>2</sub> complex that has also been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>).</p><p>YoeB is a corepressor that permits improved, probably cooperative, DNA binding by YefM most likely by either enhancing the stability of YefM, by altering YefM conformation to one that is more favourable for DNA binding, and/or by stabilizing the nucleoprotein complex at the operator site. Enhanced operator site binding by antitoxin when complexed with cognate toxin is a general characteristic of TA complexes. Furthermore, the binding of YefM alone or YefM&#x02013;YoeB to DNA induces structural alterations in the proteins: examination of the far UV region in CD spectra revealed alterations in molar ellipticity of the proteins within the nucleoprotein complex. Although CD analysis suggests that the operator site does not undergo major structural transitions when bound to either protein, the presence of a DNase I hypersensitive cleavage site in the YefM- and YefM&#x02013;YoeB-operator complexes nevertheless suggests that the operator site within the nucleoprotein complex undergoes deformations. DNA conformational changes such as bending, major groove opening and kinking are not uncommon in repressor&#x02013;operator interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>), and reflect the formation of DNA structures that interfere with assembly or progression of the transcriptional machinery.</p><p>Bacteriophage P1 specifies a TA complex comprised of the Doc toxin and Phd antitoxin. Phd is the primary transcriptional repressor of the <italic>phd-doc</italic> operon, with Doc acting as a corepressor. The <italic>phd-doc</italic> operator site consists of two 8 bp palindromes that are 13 bp apart, centre to centre. The palindromes are bound sequentially, each by one Phd dimer, with Doc acting to promote cooperative binding of Phd to the sites by an undefined mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>). YefM and Phd are homologues, although Doc and YoeB are not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). Intriguingly, the inverted repeats bound by Phd include core 5&#x02032;-GTAC-3&#x02032; motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>), identical to the central tetranucleotides of the L and S repeats recognized by YefM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Furthermore, the N-terminal end of Phd is required for DNA binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>), which has also been proposed to be the case for YefM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). The interesting parallels in operator organization, and apparently in the operator-binding properties of the N-terminal regions of YefM and Phd, attest to their common evolutionary origin. In contrast, the C-terminal halves of the two proteins are implicated in interactions with their cognate toxins and share very little similarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>), which has been proposed to reflect modular exchange of DNA binding and toxin recognition domains among proteins related to Phd (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>), including YefM homologues.</p><p>Equidistantly-spaced L and S repeats are common features in the <italic>yefM-yoeB</italic> regulatory regions of numerous genomes suggesting that YefM&#x02013;YoeB homologues in diverse backgrounds exert transcriptional regulation by a common mechanism. Axe&#x02013;Txe are YefM&#x02013;YoeB homologues encoded by the pRUM multiresistance plasmid of <italic>Enterococcus faecium</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>). L and S palindromes are located 5&#x02032; of <italic>axe-txe</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). However, the YefM homologue Axe does not repress the <italic>yefM-yoeB</italic> promoter <italic>in vivo</italic>. Conversely, YefM fails to downregulate expression from the <italic>axe</italic> promoter (B. K&#x00119;dzierska and F. Hayes, unpublished data). Despite the specificity observed <italic>in vivo</italic>, YefM and Axe recognize the non-cognate operator sites <italic>in vitro</italic> with approximately equal affinities (B. K&#x00119;dzierska and F. Hayes, unpublished data). Although sequences that flank the palindromes likely influence the binding of YefM&#x02013;YoeB to the repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), additional factors, e.g. architectural proteins might also be significant for repression of certain <italic>yefM-yoeB</italic> promoters <italic>in vivo</italic>, albeit not for other promoters. Many genomes that do not possess identifiable L and S repeats upstream of <italic>yefM-yoeB</italic> nevertheless harbour the 5&#x02032;-GTAC-3&#x02032; tetranucleotides, which are located at the centres of the L and S palindromes, and are separated by 11&#x02013;13 bp (data not shown). These abbreviated repeats might represent minimal binding sites for the cognate YefM&#x02013;YoeB proteins. In contrast, other <italic>yefM-yoeB</italic> homologues possess no upstream motifs that are obviously related to L and S palindromes: the mechanism of regulation of these <italic>yefM-yoeB</italic> operons remains to be investigated.</p><p>Based on CD analysis, YefM has been described as an intrinsically unfolded protein that typifies a novel family of proteins that entirely lack any secondary structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>). In contrast, native YefM examined here is dimeric and exhibits a CD spectrum that is consistent with a protein that is relatively well-folded and which possesses extensive &#x003b1;-helix and &#x003b2;-sheet features. This contention is supported by NMR spectra of YefM, which display signatures characteristic of a well-ordered protein containing both &#x003b1;-helical and &#x003b2;-strand secondary structure. Prediction software tools for disordered regions within proteins also suggest that YefM is well-structured, with only a patch of amino acids close to the C-terminus expected to be unfolded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). CD analysis of the Axe homologue of YefM shows that it is also highly-structured (B. K&#x00119;dzierska and F. Hayes, unpublished data). It is also worth emphasizing that the YefM dimer within the YefM<sub>2</sub>&#x02013;YoeB complex is largely structured, possessing &#x003b1;-helix, &#x003b2;-sheet and random coil elements with only the C-terminal region of one YefM monomer (corresponding to &#x0223c;18% of YefM<sub>2</sub>) being disordered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). Moreover, the bulk of the antitoxin dimer within the YefM<sub>2</sub>&#x02013;YoeB complex projects tens of angstr&#x000f6;ms from YoeB and is highly organized. It is difficult to envisage how YefM might achieve dimerization and become extensively structured principally by the interaction of a single &#x003b1;-helix at the C-terminal end of one YefM monomer with YoeB. Structure determination of free YefM<sub>2</sub>, and of YefM and YefM-YoeB structures bound to DNA, will provide further crucial insights into the mechanism by which YefM&#x02013;YoeB exerts transcriptional regulation.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank Laurence Van Melderen for providing strain SC301467, and the Biomolecular Analysis Facility, University of Manchester for assistance with MALS/QELS analysis.
