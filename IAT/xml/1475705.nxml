Understanding the molecular basis of allelic expression differences is thus an important challenge. Although many genes have been shown to display differential allelic expression, this is the first study to examine in detail the cumulative effects of multiple <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory polymorphisms responsible for allele-specific expression differences. We have used a variety of experimental approaches to identify and characterize <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory polymorphisms responsible for the extreme allele-specific expression differences of keratin-1 <italic>(KRT1)</italic> in human white blood cells. The combined data from our analyses provide strong evidence that the <italic>KRT1</italic> allelic expression differences result from the haplotypic combinations and interactions of five <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) whose alleles differ in their affinity to bind transcription factors and modulate <italic>KRT1</italic> promoter activity. Two of these <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory SNPs bind transcriptional activators with the alleles on the high-expressing <italic>KRT1</italic> haplotype pattern having a higher affinity than the alleles on the low-expressing haplotype pattern. In contrast, the other three <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory SNPs bind transcriptional inhibitors with the alleles on the low-expressing haplotype pattern having a higher affinity than the alleles on the high-expressing haplotype pattern. Our study provides important new insights into the degree of complexity that the <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory sequences responsible for allele-specific transcriptional regulation have. These data suggest that allelic expression differences result from the cumulative contribution of multiple DNA sequence polymorphisms, with each having a small effect, and that allele-specific expression can thus be viewed as a complex trait.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="synopsis"><title>Synopsis</title><p>Despite the fact that all humans share nearly identical DNA sequences, individuals exhibit tremendous variation in heritable traits, such as height, weight, and skin texture. Recent evidence suggests that expression level differences between different copies (alleles) of a gene contribute to these observed differences in heritable traits. Currently, the mechanisms underlying allele-expression level differences are poorly understood. In this report the authors identified and characterized a set of five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) contributing to extreme expression differences between keratin-1 <italic>(KRT1)</italic> alleles in humans. Each of the five SNPs is found in a different regulatory sequence in the proximity of <italic>KRT1</italic>. The SNPs cause different copies of the five regulatory sequences to differ in their affinities to bind transcription factors controlling <italic>KRT1</italic> expression. The extreme <italic>KRT1</italic> allele-expression level differences result from the cumulative contributions of these five SNPs which are tightly linked and inherited in two common fixed sets, a low- and a high-expressing set. The study provides important new insights into the complexities of the mechanisms underlying allele-expression level differences. These complexities may explain the difficulties researchers frequently encounter when trying to discover the &#x0201c;causative SNP&#x0201d; in an interval identified as associated with an inherited trait in a genetic study.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Tao H, Cox DR, Frazer KA (2006) Allele-specific <italic>KRT1</italic> expression is a complex trait.

To do this we used a comprehensive genome-wide SNP and haplotype map generated by an independent study using ethnically-diverse Coriell samples from the DNA Polymorphism Discovery Resource as previously described &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020093-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d;.

One group of four haplotype patterns were minor variants of each other and a separate group of two haplotype patterns were also minor variants of each other. When haplotype patterns with only minor variations were grouped together, the number of observed haplotype patterns in the Coriell samples was reduced to five. 82&#x00025; of the chromosomes fell into three of the five main haplotype patterns.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title><italic>KRT1</italic> Haplotype Patterns in the 36 White Blood Cell Samples</title><p>To determine the relationship between the haplotype patterns and the relative expression levels of the different <italic>KRT1</italic> alleles we determined the haplotype patterns in the 36 white blood cell samples by genotyping seven SNPs (SNPs 2, 5, 6, 11, 17, 23, and 28) that together differentiate the five main <italic>KRT1</italic> haplotypes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0020093-t002">Table 2</xref>), using real-time PCR. Only four of the five main haplotype patterns present in the Coriell samples were also present in the white blood cell samples. The three most prevalent haplotype patterns observed in the Coriell samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020093-st002">Table S2</xref>) were also the three most prevalent in the 36 white blood cell samples (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0020093-t003">Table 3</xref>). However, the relative frequencies of the haplotypes differ between the two donor populations, suggesting that the ethnic compositions of the two groups differ.</p><p>The 15 samples that were heterozygous for exonic SNP2 and had detectable levels of <italic>KRT1</italic> mRNA all contained the same two haplotype patterns: pattern number 1, which has the G allele at exonic SNP2, and pattern number 2, which has the A allele at exonic SNP2 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0020093-t001">Table 1</xref>). In each of these samples, haplotype pattern 2 was expressed at much higher levels than haplotype pattern 1, and thus we defined haplotype pattern 1 as the low-expressing haplotype pattern and haplotype pattern 2 as the high-expressing haplotype pattern. In contrast, the four samples heterozygous for exonic SNP2 that did not express <italic>KRT1</italic> contained haplotype patterns 1 and 3. These data suggest that in human white blood cells <italic>KRT1</italic> haplotype pattern 2 is expressed at significantly higher levels than haplotype patterns 1 or 3. We were unable to examine the relative expression levels of haplotype patterns 4 and 5 due to the fact that in this population the only individual containing pattern 4 was not heterozygous for <italic>KRT1</italic> exonic SNP2 and pattern 5 was not observed. The high number of white blood cell samples heterozygous for haplotype patterns 1 and 2 is expected, given the high frequencies of the two patterns in this population: 37.5&#x00025; and 50&#x00025;, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Identification of Protein-Binding SNP Intervals</title><p>To identify the <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory polymorphisms responsible for the extreme allele-specific expression differences of the <italic>KRT1</italic> gene, we focused on the SNPs that differentiate the low- and high-expressing haplotype patterns.

We used several experimental techniques to identify which of the 19 SNPs, whose alleles differ between the low- and high-expressing haplotypes, are involved in regulating the differential expression of these haplotypes. First, we performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) to examine the SNP intervals for effects on DNA-protein interactions. We incubated nuclear extracts from an epithelial cell line with 25-mer double-stranded oligonucleotide probes containing the SNPs in the center positions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020093-st003">Table S3</xref>). Under stringent assay conditions only five of the probes, corresponding to SNPs 5, 11, 17, 23, and 28, bound proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020093-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). Four of these probes showed differential protein binding, with the high-expressing alleles of SNPs 5 and 23 binding more protein than the low-expressing alleles, and the low-expressing alleles of SNPs 11 and 17 binding more protein than the high-expressing alleles. These assays were performed three independent times, with the same relative binding levels between the low- and high-expressing SNP alleles observed.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>TRANSFAC Analysis</title><p>To determine if any of the five SNP-containing intervals shown by EMSA to bind proteins contain consensus binding sites, TRANSFAC &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020093-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d; database searches were performed using the 25-mer oligonucleotide sequences given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020093-st003">Table S3</xref> and the default values of TFSearch (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cbrc.jp/research/db/TFSEARCH.html">http://www.cbrc.jp/research/db/TFSEARCH.html</ext-link>).

Pre-incubating the epithelial cell line nuclear extract with unlabeled SNP17 or SNP23 competitor oligonucleotides before adding the corresponding biotin-labeled oligonucleotide probes abolished the observed DNA-protein complexes, indicating that they are formed by specific protein-DNA binding interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020093-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). Simultaneously incubating epithelial cell nuclear extract with the biotin-labeled oligonucleotide and specific antibodies for ZEB-1 produced a supershifted band for SNP17. This supershifted band was observed with the use of two distinct anti-ZEB antibodies, but was not seen when anti-AML or anti-RXR antibodies were used, suggesting that the SNP17 interval binds specifically to ZEB.</p><p>Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed a clear enrichment of the SNP17 interval with anti-ZEB immunoprecipitates compared with mock immunoprecipitates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020093-g002">Figure 2</xref>C), although binding with anti-AML-1 immunoprecipitates is also seen. The fact that protein-DNA interactions between SNP17 interval and AML-1 are not observed in the supershift assay but appear to be present in the immunoprecipitation assay is likely due to that fact that the former uses a DNA interval (25 bp) centered on SNP17 while the later amplifies a 475-bp interval (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020093-st004">Table S4</xref>) surrounding SNP17. TRANSFAC analysis of this 475-bp sequence shows the region contains a predicted AML-1 binding site 205 bp away from SNP17. Thus, the enrichment of the SNP17 interval with anti-AML-1 immunoprecipitates over mock immunoprecipitates may be due to specific protein-DNA interactions. In aggregate, the TRANSFAC search data, the supershift assay results, and the immunoprecipitate data supports in vivo binding of ZEB to the SNP17 interval.</p><p>For the SNP23 interval, simultaneously incubating epithelial cell nuclear extract with the biotin-labeled oligonucleotide and antibodies specific for AML-1 produced a supershifted band (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020093-g002">Figure 2</xref>B), which is slightly more prominent than the background smear in the same location observed without antibodies and with antibodies specific for ZEB.

These data provide supporting evidence to the TRANSFAC search data, suggesting that the SNP23 interval binds in vivo with AML-1.</p><p>Due to the lack of an appropriate antibody for ZNF143, we were unable to use similar techniques to analyze the SNP11 interval for DNA-protein interactions.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Functional Characterization of <italic>cis</italic>-Regulatory SNP Intervals</title><p>To examine how the five SNP-containing intervals shown by EMSA to bind proteins affect in vivo <italic>KRT1</italic> promoter expression, we generated a series of 20 luciferase reporter constructs, in which SNP intervals were attached to the <italic>KRT1</italic> promoter, and performed transient expression studies.

We chose to examine these two SNP intervals because they both bind transcriptional inhibitors, and the activities between the paired low- and high-expressing constructs are significantly different. Two additional constructs were generated, with the low-expressing SNP17 and SNP28 intervals combined with the low-expressing <italic>KRT1</italic> promoter and the high-expressing SNP17, and SNP28 intervals combined with the high-expressing <italic>KRT1</italic> promoter (numbers 21&#x02013;22 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020093-g003">Figure 3</xref>). The combined low-expressing construct had 53&#x00025; less activity than the <italic>KRT1</italic> promoter alone, which is 24&#x00025; and 11&#x00025; less activity than the low-expressing SNP17 and SNP28 constructs (numbers 22, 8, 12 versus 1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020093-g003">Figure 3</xref>, respectively). And the combined high-expressing construct had 24&#x00025; less activity than the <italic>KRT1</italic> promoter alone, which is 10&#x00025; and 5&#x00025; less activity than the high-expressing SNP17 and SNP28 constructs (numbers 21, 7, 11 versus 1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020093-g003">Figure 3</xref>, respectively). Thus, when the SNP17 and SNP28 intervals are combined in a single construct, the <italic>KRT1</italic> promoter activity is repressed to a greater extent than that observed for either interval alone.</p><p>Although the two constructs containing either the low- or high-expressing <italic>KRT1</italic> promoters alone were similar in activity, we reasoned that variants in the promoter interval could be interacting with the protein-binding SNP intervals. To examine this possibility, we generated four additional constructs with the low-expressing <italic>KRT1</italic> promoter combined with the high-expressing SNP17 or SNP28 intervals and the high-expressing <italic>KRT1</italic> promoter combined with the low-expressing SNP17 and SNP28 intervals (numbers 23&#x02013;26 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020093-g003">Figure 3</xref>). The high-expressing promoter combined with the low-expressing SNP17 or SNP28 intervals had respectively 3&#x00025; and 19&#x00025; greater activity than the low-expressing promoter combined with these same intervals (numbers 23 versus 8, and 25 versus 12 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020093-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Whereas the constructs containing the low-expressing promoter combined with the high-expressing SNP17 or SNP28 intervals both had respectively 10&#x00025; and 18&#x00025; less activity then the high-expressing promoter combined with the same intervals (numbers 24 versus 7, and 26 versus 11 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020093-g003">Figure 3</xref>). These data suggest that the degree of transcriptional repression is dependent on interaction between the repressors binding to the SNP intervals and the <italic>KRT1</italic> promoter itself, with the low-expressing version of the promoter producing a greater inhibitory effect. Thus, polymorphisms in the promoter interval, such as SNP9 and SNP10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020093-g001">Figure 1</xref>), as well as other variants not yet identified, may also play a role in the differential expression of <italic>KRT1</italic> low- and high-expressing haplotypes.</p></sec><sec id="s2i"><title>Decoy Oligonucleotides</title><p>To confirm that the inhibitory effects of the ~ 350-bp SNP17 and SNP28 intervals were due to sequences containing the SNPs, we performed double-stranded DNA decoy oligonucleotide assays &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020093-b028">28</xref>&#x0005d;. When double-stranded DNA decoy oligonucleotides are transfected into cells they compete with regulatory sequences for binding transcription factors and therefore enhance or reduce transcriptional activation. The decoy oligonucleotides, O17<sub>H</sub>, O17<sub>L</sub>, O28<sub>H</sub>, and O28<sub>L</sub>, used to compete with the SNP17 and SNP28 reporter constructs for transcriptional factors, are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020093-g003">Figure 3</xref>. The activity of the construct containing the high-expressing version of the <italic>KRT1</italic> promoter alone co-transfected with decoy oligonucleotide O17<sub>H</sub> (number 27 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020093-g003">Figure 3</xref>), was used as the control against which the expression levels of SNP17 interval-containing constructs were compared (numbers 28&#x02013;32 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020093-g003">Figure 3</xref>). The activity of this same construct co-transfected with decoy oligonucleotide O28<sub>H</sub> (number 33 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020093-g003">Figure 3</xref>) was used as the control against which the expression levels of SNP28 interval-containing constructs were compared (numbers 34&#x02013;38 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020093-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Co-transfection of SNP17 and SNP28 decoy oligonucleotides with their corresponding constructs (numbers 29&#x02013;30 and 35&#x02013;36 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020093-g003">Figure 3</xref>) reversed the inhibitory effects of these intervals on the <italic>KRT1</italic> promoter activity (numbers 7&#x02013;8 and 11&#x02013;12 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020093-g003">Figure 3</xref>). These results imply that the 25-bp regions immediately surrounding SNPs 17 and 28 are responsible for the observed inhibitory effects of the SNP17 and SNP28 intervals on the <italic>KRT1</italic> promoter activity.</p><p>Interestingly, the low-expressing SNP17 construct co-transfected with the low-expressing SNP17 allele decoy had 31&#x00025; greater activity than the control (number 27 versus 30 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020093-g003">Figure 3</xref>). When the low-expressing SNP17 allele decoy was co-transfected with the high-expressing construct, and vice versa (numbers 31&#x02013;32 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020093-g003">Figure 3</xref>), the high-expressing construct had 52&#x00025; greater activity than the control. These data indicate that the low-expressing SNP17 decoy binds the transcriptional repressor more tightly than the high-expressing SNP17 decoy. The observed increased activity of the SNP17 constructs in the presence of the O17<sub>L</sub> compared with the control is surprising. One explanation for these results is that if the repressor does not bind to the 475-bp SNP17 interval (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020093-st004">Table S4</xref>), then a binding site for a transcriptional activator becomes available or a DNA conformation change occurs, resulting in an enhancement of the <italic>KRT1</italic> promoter activity. When the low-expressing SNP28 allele decoy was co-transfected with the high-expressing construct, and vice versa (numbers 37&#x02013;38 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020093-g003">Figure 3</xref>), the high-expressing construct had 17&#x00025; greater activity and the low-expressing construct had 17&#x00025; decreased activity compared with the control. These data are consistent with the results observed for the SNP17 decoy tests, suggesting that the low-expressing SNP28 decoy binds a repressor more tightly than the high-expressing decoy, and that by preventing the repressor from binding the 414-bp SNP28 interval allows for the binding of an activator or a DNA conformation change, and thus increased construct activity over the control.</p></sec><sec id="s2j"><title>Comparative Sequence Analysis of the 26-Kb <italic>KRT1</italic> Haplotype Block</title><p>To further characterize the intervals containing the five <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory SNPs we performed a comparative analysis between human and mouse sequences to determine if they are evolutionarily conserved. We obtained the nucleotide sequence of the 26-kb <italic>KRT1</italic> haplotype and aligned it to the orthologous mouse interval using VISTA browser (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pipeline.lbl.gov/cgi-bin/gateway2">http://pipeline.lbl.gov/cgi-bin/gateway2</ext-link>). The alignment of the human and mouse intervals revealed 35 conserved sequences (&#x02265; 100 nucleotides in length and &#x02265; 70&#x00025; identity). Of these 35 conserved sequences in the 26-kb haplotype block, 19 overlap exons or UTRs from <italic>KRT1</italic> and <italic>KRT1B,</italic> and 16 are present in non-coding regions. Considering all 29 SNPs in the 26-kb <italic>KRT1</italic> interval, four occur within the 35 conserved sequences (SNPs 2, 12, 18, and 28) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020093-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Two of these are present in protein-encoding sequences (SNP2 resides in exon 9 of human <italic>KRT1</italic> and SNP28 resides in exon 2 of human <italic>KRT1B</italic>), and the other two (SNP12 and SNP18) are in conserved non-coding sequences. SNPs 12 and 18 have the same alleles in the <italic>KRT1</italic> low- and high-expressing haplotype patterns, and therefore are not likely to be involved in <italic>KRT1</italic> differential allelic expression. It is interesting to note that the SNP28 interval appears to have dual functions as both a transcriptional regulatory sequence inhibiting <italic>KRT1</italic> promoter activity and an exonic sequence in the <italic>KRT1B</italic> gene &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020093-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;.

Four of the <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory SNP intervals containing SNPs 5, 11, 17, and 28 could be aligned unambiguously to chimpanzee sequences, in each case the SNP allele with the lower affinity for the transcription factor was the derived one. Thus, the high-expressing SNP5 allele and the low-expressing SNP11, SNP17, and SNP28 alleles were the ancestral ones. The high-expressing exonic SNP2 was the ancestral sequence. Based on these data, both the low- and high-expressing haplotypes are derived, and haplotype pattern 3 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0020093-t003">Table 3</xref>) is the ancestral one.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our aim was to discover and characterize the regulatory sequences responsible for the extreme allele-specific expression differences of <italic>KRT1</italic> in human white blood cells. In all individuals expressing <italic>KRT1</italic> and heterozygous for exonic SNP2, the same allele is always expressed at a significantly higher level then the other allele. These data suggest that the <italic>KRT1</italic> allelic-expression differences likely result primarily from <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory polymorphisms in strong linkage disequilibrium with exonic SNP2. We determined that all nine <italic>KRT1</italic> exons as well as ~22 kb of sequences upstream of the gene are contained within a single haplotype block. The high-expressing <italic>KRT1</italic> exonic SNP2 allele maps to haplotype pattern 2, while the low-expressing SNP2 allele maps to haplotype pattern 1, suggesting that <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory variants differing between these two haplotypes are likely responsible for the majority of the allele-specific expression differences.</p><p>Examining SNPs whose alleles differ between the low- and high-expressing <italic>KRT1</italic> haplotypes using a variety of experimental and computational methods, we identified five <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory polymorphisms. SNP5 and SNP23 <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory intervals act as positive regulators of the <italic>KRT1</italic> promoter in luciferase reporter assays, while SNP11, SNP17, and SNP28 <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory intervals act as negative regulators. Consistent with these data is the fact that SNP11 and SNP17 are present in predicted binding sites for ZNF143 and ZEB, respectively; both known to act as negative transcriptional regulators. And SNP23 is present in a predicted binding site for AML-1, a known positive transcriptional regulator. EMSA and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays suggest that ZEB and AML-1 respectively bind the SNP17 and SNP23 intervals in vivo.</p><p>Our study shows that the extreme allele-specific expression differences of <italic>KRT1</italic> result from the haplotypic combinations of the five <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory polymorphisms that differ between the low- and high-expressing patterns. The high-expressing alleles of SNP5 and SNP23 bind more protein in the EMSA than the low-expressing allele. In addition, the high-expressing SNP23 allele exhibited an almost 2-fold increase in the <italic>KRT1</italic> promoter activity compared with the low-expressing allele in the luciferase reporter assay. Thus, for both SNP5 and SNP23 the high-expressing alleles appear to have higher affinities for transcriptional activators than the low-expressing alleles. On the other hand, the low-expressing alleles of SNP11 and SNP17 bind more protein in EMSA than the high-expressing allele. In the luciferase reporter assays the low-expressing SNP17 and SNP28 constructs have approximately 2-fold less <italic>KRT1</italic> promoter activity then the high-expressing allele constructs. Thus, our data indicate that for SNP11, SNP17, and SNP28 the low-expressing alleles have higher affinities for transcriptional repressors than the high-expressing alleles. Additionally, when combined, the SNP17 and SNP28 intervals result in a greater reduction of <italic>KRT1</italic> promoter activity then that observed for either interval alone. And interactions between the individual SNP17 and SNP28 intervals with the <italic>KRT1</italic> promoter(s) suggest that there are functional polymorphisms in the promoter region resulting in less activity for the low-expressing version. It is important to note that in addition to these functional promoter variants other <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory polymorphisms may exist in the <italic>KRT1</italic> haplotype block and/or adjacent haplotype blocks that are also involved in the extreme differential <italic>KRT1</italic> allelic expression. However, the haplotypic combinations of the five <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory polymorphisms that we identified and characterized in this study can readily explain a large fraction of the observed allele-specific <italic>KRT1</italic> expression differences.</p><p>Previous studies examining allele-specific expression differences have focused on analyzing single SNPs or SNPs grouped in a short interval, such as a promoter &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020093-b029">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020093-b034">34</xref>&#x0005d;. Thus, our study provides important new insights into the complexities of the molecular mechanisms underlying allele-expression differences. The fact that each of the five <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory SNPs we characterized contributes to just a fraction of the observed variation indicates that allele-specific expression is itself a complex trait. Interestingly, the finding that allelic-expression differences can result from the interaction of multiple <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory SNPs may explain the difficulties researchers frequently encounter when trying to discover the &#x0201c;causative SNP&#x0201d; underlying a linkage peak or in an interval identified as associated with a trait in a genetic study.</p><p>It is generally well proven that non-coding sequences conserved between humans and mice can represent functional regulatory elements &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020093-b035">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020093-b037">37</xref>&#x0005d;.

Based on functional data in this study we proposed that this class of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory sequences represent rapidly evolving elements that are responsible for gene expression differences between species. Since the <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory SNPs identified here are involved in intra-species gene regulatory differences, the fact that four of the intervals, SNP5, SNP11, SNP17, and SNP23, are not evolutionarily conserved between humans and mice is consistent with our previous observations and hypothesis. The fact that the SNP28 interval appears to have dual functions as a <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory sequence and an exonic sequence in the <italic>KRT1B</italic> gene raises the possibility that transcription of the <italic>KRT1</italic> and <italic>KRT1B</italic> genes is linked by a novel mechanism.</p><p><italic>KRT1</italic> has not previously been shown to have a functional role in white blood cells, and hence we are unable to state whether or not the observed expression differences between the low-expressing and high-expressing haplotype patterns have physiological relevance.

Based on the functional role of <italic>KRT1</italic> it is interesting to hypothesize that the allele-specific expression differences observed in human white blood cells may be associated with keratinocyte migration rates in response to wounding.

The PCR reactions were carried out in 50-&#x003bc;l reaction volumes with 1X PCR buffer, 2mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM dNTP, 20 ng DNA, and 5 units of Taq Gold DNA polymerase. The PCR products were cloned into the TA cloning vector pCR2.1 (Invitrogen). The <italic>KRT1</italic> promoter fragment was digested by <italic>Hind</italic>III from pCR2.1 and ligated into the <italic>Hind</italic>III-site of pGL3-basic vector (Promega, Madison, Wisconsin, United States) to generate the <italic>KRT1</italic> promoter-luciferase reporter constructs, pGL3- PRH and pGL3- PRL, with H and L being the high-expressing and low-expressing alleles respectively. The nine other sets of high- and low-expressing SNP-containing intervals were digested by <italic>Kpn</italic>I and <italic>Xho</italic>I from pCR2.1, gel-purified and ligated into the <italic>Kpn</italic>I and <italic>Xho</italic>I sites of the pGL3-PRH and pGL3- PRL promoter constructs in various combinations to generate SNP region-<italic>KRT1</italic> promoter luciferase reporter constructs pGL3- PH/L SNPnH/L, where <italic>n</italic> is the SNP number.</p></sec><sec id="s4f"><title>Transfection of luciferase reporter constructs.</title><p>We transfected each of the 26 luciferase reporter constructs into a duodenum epithelial cell line (HuTu80) that was obtained from ATCC (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, Virginia, United States) and cultured in MEM alpha medium supplemented with 10&#x00025; FBS. Although <italic>KRT1</italic> is not known to be expressed in duodenum epithelial cells under normal physiological circumstances, the HuTu80 cells are appropriate to use for examining the effect of the SNP alleles in transcriptional regulation using reporter gene assays because they are of epithelial origin. Approximately 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> cells/well were seeded in 24-well cell culture plates 24 h before transfection. The cells were simultaneously transfected with one of the 30 pGL<sub>3</sub>-luciferase reporter constructs (0.8 &#x003bc;g) and a pSV- &#x003b2;-galactosidase control plasmid (0.2 &#x003bc;g) (Promega) to use as an internal standard for transfection efficiency using 2-&#x003bc;l Lipofectamine reagent (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's instructions. For the decoy oligonucleotide analysis 25 pico-moles of double-stranded O17 or O28 decoy oligonucleotides were co-transfected with the reporter constructs &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020093-b045">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020093-b046">46</xref>&#x0005d;. After 48 h, the cells were harvested and lysed with reporter lysis buffer. Luciferase and &#x003b2;-galactosidase expression were assayed with the Bright-Glo luciferase assay system (Promega) and the Galactosidase enzyme assay system (Promega), respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s4g"><title>Analysis of luciferase reporter constructs.</title><p>The reporter constructs containing only the <italic>KRT1</italic> promoter region were assayed six independent times in triplicate. The other 24 reporter constructs were assayed two or three independent times in triplicate or quadruplicate. Assays were performed on different days, with the promoter-only constructs assayed on each occasion. For each individual transfection the luciferase activity was normalized against the &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity. To allow comparisons between the assays performed on different days, we normalized the results from each day by dividing values for each construct assay by the lowest <italic>KRT1</italic> promoter-only construct value. The high-expressing <italic>KRT1</italic> promoter was the control construct that all other constructs were compared with; its relative luciferase activity was 100&#x00025; &#x000b1; 7&#x00025;, which represents the mean &#x000b1; standard deviation of 18 independent assays.</p></sec><sec id="s4h"><title>Comparative sequence analysis.</title><p>We obtained the nucleotide sequence of the 26-kb haplotype block on human Chromosome 12 (nucleotides 51, 354, 757&#x02013;51, 381, 206 from NCBI Build 35) from the UCSC Genome Browser Gateway (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgGateway">http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgGateway</ext-link>).

The SNP alleles of the high- (H) and low- (L) expressing haplotypes are shown, with the 19 SNPs that differ between the two haplotypes highlighted. The exonic SNP (number 2) assayed for differential allelic expression is blue; those shown by transient expression assay to enhance or repress <italic>KRT1</italic> promoter activity are green and red, respectively; and the rest are dark gray.</p><p>(B) Results from the functional tests for five of the SNPs are summarized. The relative strength of protein binding by the low- and high-expressing SNP alleles is indicated by symbols (&#x0003e;, &#x0003c;, or &#x0003d;). Similarly, the symbols (&#x0003e;, &#x0003c;, or &#x0003d;) indicate the relative degree of increased or decreased <italic>KRT1</italic> promoter activity of the low- and high-expressing SNP constructs. The diagram depicts that <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory SNPs 5 and 23 bind activators (green) as evidenced by increased <italic>KRT1</italic> promoter activity over control constructs, and <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory SNPs 11, 17, and 28 bind repressors (red) as evidenced by decreased <italic>KRT1</italic> promoter activity compared with control constructs. When differential binding or activity is observed, the activators have higher affinity to SNP alleles in the high-expressing haplotype (H), while the repressors have higher affinity to SNP alleles in the low-expressing haplotype (L).
