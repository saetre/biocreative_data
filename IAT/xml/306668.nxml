After preliminary studies demonstrated the cPLA2 gene is expressed in a variety of human tissues and was localized to the q arm of chromosome 1 between markers F13B and D1S74, we cloned and characterized the 5'-flanking region of this gene in order to identify the elements controlling its low level constitutive expression. The 5'-flanking region has features typical of a housekeeping gene with no TATA box or CAAT box, although atypical in that it is not GC rich, has no SP1 sites, and has a long run of CA repeats. Analysis of fragments of the 5'-flanking region demonstrated that 541 bp 5' to exon 1 supported reporter gene activity at a level 30% of the SV40 promoter. Interestingly, similar activity was observed by deleting most of the 5'-flanking region down to a 27 bp region containing a sequence with homology to the initiator sequence in the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase gene and a polypyrimidine tract similar to the initiator element of the mouse ribosomal protein gene. Within this 27 bp region, a 10 bp fragment (-17 to -8 bp) within the polypyrimidine tract is critical for the baseline expression of the human cPLA2 gene. While the 5'-flanking region contains a putative composite AP-1 and glucocorticoid response element, this region does not respond to tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) and/or glucocorticoids in a cell line (HEp-2) that exhibits upregulation of cPLA2 mRNA transcript levels by TNF. The observations that the expression of the cPLA2 gene is tightly controlled at a relatively low level is consistent with the evolving concept that modulation of expression of this critical enzyme is primarily at the post-translational level.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00002-0111-a" xlink:role="295"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00002-0112-a" xlink:role="296"/></fig><fig id="F3"><graphic xlink:href="nar00002-0113-a" xlink:role="297"/></fig><fig id="F4"><graphic xlink:href="nar00002-0116-a" xlink:role="300"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00002-0109.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="293"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00002-0110.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="294"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00002-0111.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="295"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00002-0112.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="296"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00002-0113.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="297"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00002-0114.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="298"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00002-0115.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="299"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00002-0116.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="300"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00002-0117.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="301"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
