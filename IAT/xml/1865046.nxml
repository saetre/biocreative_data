A splicing-competent spliceosome consists of the five snRNPs U1, U2, U5, basepaired U4/6 and many associated proteins, which when activated undergoes conformational changes to catalyze the two transesterification reactions in an snRNP particle consisting of U2, U5 and U6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3">1&#x02013;3</xref>). Several studies indicate that pre-mRNA splicing <italic>in vivo</italic> is coupled to transcription. This requires that the assembly of competent spliceosomes be coordinated with transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4 B5 B6">4&#x02013;6</xref>). It is still under debate whether spliceosome assembly <italic>in vivo</italic> proceeds in a strictly ordered stepwise manner by recruiting individual splicing components on to the nascent pre-mRNAs, as suggested for spliceosome assembly <italic>in vitro</italic>, or whether pre-assembled splicing-competent spliceosomes are recruited to introns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). In <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, the U1 snRNP contacts introns first <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, thus playing an important role in intron recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>).</p><p>There are very few examples of regulated splicing in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>S. pombe</italic>, and the size of introns is considerably smaller than in mammalian genes. The removal of introns in the two yeasts appears to be mainly constitutive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). However, with respect to splicing regulation, major differences exist between these organisms. In <italic>S. pombe</italic>, the phosphorylation of the spliceosomal protein Prp1p by Prp4p kinase is involved in the activation of spliceosomes <italic>in vivo</italic>, whereas for <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, which does not contain a counterpart of Prp4p kinase, it is suggested that a spliceosome undergoes the ordered series of interactions and allosteric conformational changes as soon as a splicing-competent spliceosome is fully assembled on an intron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9 B10 B11 B12">9&#x02013;12</xref>). Interestingly, almost all eukaryotic organisms whose genome is known contain a counterpart of Prp4 kinase, with the exception of the hemiascomycetes to which <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> belongs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>).</p><p>By employing tandem affinity purification (TAP), a large complex was purified from <italic>S. pombe</italic> containing Prp1p, Prp31p and other spliceosomal proteins, indicating that a tetra-snRNP particle containing U2, U4, U5 and U6 may exist <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). These large complexes associated with the spliceosomal proteins Prp1p and Prp31 seem to be a mixture of spliceosomal particles containing U2, U5 and basepaired U4/U6 (tetra-snRNP) and splicing-competent spliceosomes containing U2, U5, U4/U6 and U1 (penta-snRNP, 10). Another <italic>in-vivo</italic>-derived complex from <italic>S. pombe</italic> was purified and analyzed using proteomics. This complex lacks Prp1p and Prp31p, but contains 27 splicing factors and the snRNAs U2, U5 and U6, indicating that these complexes might be a mixture of activated and post-catalytic spliceosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>).</p><p>The U1 snRNP of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> has been extensively characterized since it differs in many ways from that found in mammals. The U1 snRNA of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> is 568 nucleotides long, whereas human snRNA U1 counts 164 nucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). Ten proteins associated with the U1 snRNA are highly conserved from yeast to man, including the heteroheptameric Sm proteins binding to the Sm site, and three U1 specific proteins called U1-70K, U1A and U1C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). The U1 snRNP of <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic> contains a U1-70K and U1C related protein, but instead of U1A a protein called U1-24K was identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). The U1 particle of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> is associated with seven additional proteins, which are essential for function in pre-mRNA splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). As mentioned before, the U1 particle plays a major role in intron recognition. It has been suggested that one reason for the greater complexity of the budding yeast U1 particle might be the unique architecture of the introns in <italic>S. cerevisiae. S. cerevisiae</italic> contains only 256 introns in 5% of its genes, which are between 35 and 600&#x02009;bp in size (mean size 264), and their splicing consensus sequences are highly conserved. In contrast, mammalian introns show an enormous variety in architecture and vary in size from 35&#x02009;bp to thousands of kilobases. The splicing consensus sequences in mammalian introns are less highly conserved, and more than 70% of the genes are alternatively spliced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). This implicates that in mammalia a much more versatile set of proteins might be recruited and transiently interacting with the basic U1 particle early in the splicing process, depending on features of the intron exon context that needs to be recognized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>).</p><p>The <italic>S. pombe</italic> snRNA U1 is 148 nucleotides long, and RNA folding analysis suggest that its secondary structure is similar to the human U1 snRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). <italic>S. pombe</italic> contains 4730 introns, and 43% of its genes display introns. The introns are very short (mean size 81&#x02009;bp), and the splicing consensus sequences are much less conserved than in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). A comparison of the splicing factors of <italic>S. pombe</italic> with <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and mammals revealed that the <italic>S. pombe</italic> genome contains homologs of U1-70K, U1A, U1C and of seven Sm proteins. In addition, homologs of three U1-specific proteins of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, called Prp39p, Prp40p and Luc7p, have been identified. Homologs of the other four <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>-specific U1 proteins Snu71p, Prp42p, Snu56p and Nam8p have not been identified, however (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>).</p><p>In order to further characterize spliceosomal complexes existing <italic>in vivo</italic> in <italic>S. pombe</italic>, we fused the U1-specific protein U1-70K with TAP-tag and HA-tag, respectively, and analysed the molecular complexes identified with this approach. Much to our surprise, we discovered particles sedimenting in the range of 30&#x02013;60S, containing exclusively U1 snRNA.</p><p>Using the TAP method and mass spectrometric analyses, we identified in these complexes the homologs of U1-70K, U1A, U1C and the seven Sm homologs. We also identified the homologs of the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> U1-specific proteins Prp39p, Prp40p and Luc7p. In addition, we found three <italic>S. pombe</italic>-specific proteins U1H (Usp107p), UIJ (Usp108p) and U1L (Usp109p) associated with U1 snRNP. We show that the genes encoding U1-70K and the three <italic>S. pombe</italic>-specific proteins are essential for growth.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Strains, media, gene disruption, <italic>in vivo</italic> tagging</title><p>Standard genetic and molecular techniques were used as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>).

Total RNA was hybridized to 5&#x02032; labeled oligonucleotides complementary with the spliceosomal snRNAs U1, U2, U4, U5 and U6. The hybridization solution containing single or all five complementary oligonucleotides was separated on a non-denaturing gel and visualized by autoradiography. Notably, extracts of fission yeast do not contain appreciable amounts of individual U4 snRNA molecules. Almost all U4 appears to be basepaired with U6 snRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A, lane 4, asterisk and arrow). However, U6 snRNA exists in particles basepaired with and free of U4 snRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A, lane 6). </p><p>In order to sort out spliceosomal snRNP complexes existing in fission yeast, cell extract was separated on a 10&#x02013;30% glycerol gradient containing 150&#x02009;mM sodium chloride and fractionated. RNA was isolated from each fraction and hybridized against the labeled oligonucleotides complementary to U1, U2, U5 and U6. The hybridization solution of each fraction was separated on a non-denaturing gel. The spliceosomal snRNA profile of the cell extract reflects the steady state concentration of individual spliceosomal snRNPs and multiple higher-order complexes of different sizes in their native state. It is noteworthy that most U6 and U5 snRNPs are found sedimenting in complexes larger than 30S, and that U4/U6 snRNP molecules are also found in higher-order complexes sedimenting in regions &#x0003e;30S. The profile of the U1 and U2 snRNPs shows particles sedimenting in a wide range from 12 to 60S (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B).</p></sec><sec><title>snRNP U1 particles associated with U1-70K sediment in the range of 30&#x02013;60S</title><p>To identify snRNP particles associated with U1-70K (referred to as Usp101p in fission yeast, for U1-specific protein), we used a strain in which the genomic copy of <italic>usp101</italic> was fused with the HA-epitope and separated cell extract on a glycerol gradient. Each fraction was immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibody and immunoblotted. Most of U1-70K-HA (Usp101p) sediments in the range of 30&#x02013;60S (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, panel U1-70K-HA). From aliquots of the immunoprecipitates, RNA was isolated by phenol extraction. The snRNA composition co-precipitating with HA-U1-70K was analyzed with the solution hybridization assay by hybridizing the mixture of labeled oligonucleotides complementary to U1, U2, U5 and U6. The hybridization solution was then separated on a non-denaturing gel. Unexpectedly, the particles containing U1-70K-HA sedimenting in the range of 30&#x02013;60S contain exclusively U1 snRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). However, U1 snRNPs are also detected sedimenting below 30S (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). The mammalian U1 snRNP sediments at 12S and the U1 snRNP of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> at 18S (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Therefore, our result suggests that in <italic>S. pombe</italic> the U1 particles sedimenting in the range of 30&#x02013;60S contain U1-70K, whereas the U1 particles sedimenting lower than 30S do not. </p></sec><sec><title>Isolation of U1-70K complexes by TAP purification</title><p>To determine the protein composition of the U1 particles, we chose to purify the complex with the tandem affinity purification method (TAP). For this purpose, we used a strain expressing a U1-70K-TAP (Usp101p-TAP). This strain grows with the same viability as a wild-type strain and shows no morphological abnormalities. The two affinity steps using immunoglobulin G (IgG)-Sepharose and calmodulin resin, respectively, were carried out as described by Gould <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). The U1-70K-TAP complex was separated by Tricine SDS-PAGE and stained with a fluorescent dye (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). The fluorescent bands were individually subjected to an in-gel-digestion procedure, and the eluted peptides were sequenced and identified by liquid chromatography coupled tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Proteins present in a mock TAP purification performed with extract from a wild-type strain that does not express a TAP-tag-fused protein were assumed to be nonspecific contaminants. In addition, to identify the polypeptide composition of the U1-70K-TAP complex, the eluate from the second affinity step was precipitated with TCA, subjected to tryptic digestion and analyzed by LC-MS/MS. </p><p>With these approaches, we identified, in addition to U1-70K (Usp101p), the seven Sm protein family members and the homologs of U1A and U1C, which we now call Usp102p and Usp103p, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). The homologs of the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> U1-specific proteins Prp40p, Prp39p and Luc7p were identified and named Usp104p, Usp105p and Usp106p. Three <italic>S. pombe</italic>-specific proteins displaying conserved RNA binding motifs were also detected and named U1H (Usp107p), U1J (Usp108p) and U1L (Usp109p) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). According to this analysis, the snRNP U1 in <italic>S. pombe</italic> consists at least of nine U1-specific proteins. The fluorescent bands labeled with asterisk contained ribosomal proteins of the large and small subunits and other proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). </p><p>For validation of these results, we fused the TAP tag with the <italic>S. pombe</italic>-specific proteins U1H (Usp107p), U1J (Usp108p) and U1L (Usp109p). Proteomic analysis of the U1H-TAP-, U1J-TAP- and U1L-TAP- purified complexes confirmed the protein composition of the U1-70K-TAP complex, revealing nine U1-specific proteins and seven Sm proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref> and Figure 1S A, B supplement).</p><p>Next, we wanted to confirm that the <italic>S. pombe</italic>-specific proteins U1H, U1L and U1K are exclusively associated with U1 snRNA. Therefore, we constructed strains expressing U1H-TAP and U1-70K-HA, U1J-TAP and U1-70K-HA, U1L-TAP and U1-70K-HA, respectively. Protein extract of each strain was purified by the TAP method. The material eluted from the calmodulin resin was separated on SDS-PAGE, immunoblotted and probed with antibody against the calmodulin binding peptide (CBP, called &#x003b1;TAP) in the TAP domain to detect U1H, U1J and U1L, respectively, and probed with HA-antibodies to detect U1-70K-HA. All three <italic>S. pombe</italic>-specific proteins U1H, UIJ and U1L are associated with a complex containing U1-70K and reveal the size expected after removal of the protein A domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). </p><p>The material eluted from the second affinity step was also used to isolate RNA. The RNA was separated on a denaturing gel and stained with ethidium bromide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C). Then the RNA was transferred to nitrocellulose and hybridized with a <sup>32</sup>P-labeled probe comprising the complete <italic>snu1</italic> (U1 snRNA) gene and visualized by autoradiography. Noteworthy, the <italic>snu1</italic> probe detects a second major and several minor degradation products. The major degradation product is approximately 10 nucleotides smaller than the 148&#x02009;nt U1 snRNA and can also be stained with ethidium bromide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A and C). The same nitrocellulose was re-probed with a mixture of <sup>32</sup>P-labeled DNA probes comprising the complete <italic>snu2, snu4, snu5</italic> and <italic>snu6</italic> genes. These probes do not detect additional U snRNAs, suggesting that the complexes U1H, U1L, U1J and U1-70K isolated by the TAP-purification method contain exclusively snRNA U1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A and B). </p><p>To investigate whether U1H, U1L and U1J sediment with particles of the same size range as U1-70K, protein extract was separated on a glycerol gradient. The gradient fractions were separated on SDS-PAGE, immunoblotted and probed with the appropriate antibodies. U1H-TAP is associated with particles sedimenting in the range of 30&#x02013;60S as observed for U1-70K-TAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>). The sedimentation profile of U1J-TAP and U1L-TAP, however, is different. Both proteins sediment in a wide range between 11 and 60S (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A). </p><p>In order to examine whether U1L-TAP sedimenting below 30S is associated with snRNA U1 and U1-70K-HA, the gradient fractions 3&#x02013;8 and 10&#x02013;15 were pooled and IgG-Sepharose was added to bind U1L-TAP complexes. The IgG-Sepharose-bound material was separated on SDS-PAGE, immunoblotted and probed with IgG and HA antibodies to detect U1L-TAP and U1-70K-HA, respectively. RNA was also isolated from the IgG-bound material and hybridized with a U1 probe. Both pooled gradient fractions contain snRNA U1, indicating that U1L sedimenting below 30S is associated with U1 snRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A, B). Furthermore, in the gradient fractions 10&#x02013;15, significantly more U1-70K-HA was found associated with U1L than in the gradient fractions 3&#x02013;8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B). This is consistent with the sedimentation profile of U1-70K, indicating that most of U1-70K is associated with U1 particles sedimenting in the range of 30&#x02013;60S (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figures 6</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Based on the sedimentation profile of U1H (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A), we would predict that the U1 particles sedimenting below 30S (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B) also do not contain U1H. Noteworthy here, U1-70K and U1H remain stably associated with the particles sedimenting in the range of 30&#x02013;60S at salt concentrations less than or equal to 500&#x02009;mM sodium chloride (results not shown).</p><p>In order to compare the sedimentation profile of U1-70K-TAP complexes observed with whole cell extract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>, panel U1-70K-C) with the sedimentation profile of U1-70K-TAP complexes after TAP-purification, the material eluted from the calmodulin resin was separated on a glycerol gradient containing 150&#x02009;mM sodium chloride. The gradient fractions were then separated by SDS-PAGE, immunoblotted and probed with the appropriate antibodies. Strikingly, the purified U1-70K-TAP complexes sediment in a wide range of 11&#x02013;60S (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>, panel U1-70K-T). Northern analysis of the RNA isolated from the gradient fractions and probing with the complete <italic>snu1</italic> gene revealed that the TAP-purified U1-70K complexes sedimenting below 30S also contain U1 snRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>, panel snRNA). This result suggests that in whole-cell extract the U1 snRNP particles may exist as aggregates of more than one U1 particle (30&#x02013;60S), partially falling apart to monomeric U1 snRNP particles sedimenting in the region of 20S. We do not know when the particles fall apart during the TAP-procedure. </p><p>In a first approach to investigate whether the U1 particles sedimenting in the range of 30&#x02013;60S might be at least dimeric, we constructed a strain expressing U1-70K fused with HA epitopes at the C-terminus (U1-70K-HA) and also expressing U1-70K fused with Myc-epitopes at the N-terminus (U1-70K-Myc). Whole cell extract was immunoprecipitated with anti-HA and anti-Myc antibodies, respectively. The immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE, immunoblotted and probed with the appropriate antibodies. The results show that U1-70K-HA co-precipitates U1-70K-Myc and vice verca, indicating that U1-particles sedimenting in the region of 30&#x02013;60S, indeed, may be at least dimeric (Figure 2S).</p><p>In order to determine if the newly identified U1-specific proteins are essential, we disrupted the gene encoding Usp101p (U1-70K) and the three <italic>S. pombe</italic>-specific genes encoding Usp107p (U1H), Usp108p (U1J) and Usp109 (U1L) in diploid cells. Tetrad analyses indicated that all four genes are essential for growth (Figure 3S).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In this study, we used the TAP-method to purify complexes associated with the <italic>S. pombe</italic> homolog of the U1-specific protein U1-70K and identified its proteins with LC-MS/MS tandem mass spectrometry. This approach revealed the existence of complexes containing at least 16 proteins. Three of them are the homologs of U1-70K, U1A and U1C, which are conserved throughout eukaryotes. The proteins Usp104p (Prp40p), Usp105p (Prp39p) and Usp106p (Luc7p) appear to be conserved in fungi (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). U1H (Usp107p), U1J (Usp108p) and U1L (Usp109p) had no sequences with significant similarity and, therefore, these three proteins appear to be fission yeast specific. The seven Sm proteins are conserved throughout eukaryotes and are not only associated with the snRNP U1, but are also found associated with the snRNPs U2, U4 and U5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). We have confirmed these protein interactions by purifying and analyzing U1H-TAP, U1J-TAP and U1L-TAP complexes. The density gradient analyses revealed that U1-70K and U1H are associated with U1 particles sedimenting in the range of 30&#x02013;60S, whereas U1J and U1L appear to be associated with U1 particles sedimenting in wider range (11&#x02013;60S). Based on these observations, we suggest that the U1 particles sedimenting at 30&#x02013;60S and containing at least 16 proteins represent the pool of functional U1 particles ready to engage in pre-mRNA splicing. The U1 snRNPs sedimenting below 30S obviously do not contain a full set of the nine U1-specific proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A and B). As mentioned before, we were surprised that the particle containing 16 proteins and the 148&#x02009;nt U1 snRNA component sediments in the region of 30&#x02013;60S. In contrast, the U1 particle of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> associated with 17 proteins and a 568&#x02009;nt U1 snRNA component sediments at 18S (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). We are aware that the association of multimeric U1 snRNPs might be an artifact due to cell lysis. However, based on our analyses, it is also reasonable to suggest that the U1 snRNPs ready for splicing might be stored as higher-order structures in the nucleus and that the U1 particles sedimenting below 30S might be U1 particles just released from activated spliceosomes to be recycled for the splicing process.</p><p>The U1-specific proteins Snu71p, Prp42p, Snu56p and Nam8p of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> have no apparent homolog in <italic>S. pombe</italic> and have not yet been found in any other eukaryote (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>).</p><p>The same is true for U1H, U 1J and U1L; we did not find homologues in any other eukaryote.</p><p>However, Snu71p, for example, could be the functional counterpart of U1H. The two proteins are similar in size and display a PWI motif in the C-terminus of the protein (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). The motifs found in U1H, U1J and U1L of <italic>S. pombe</italic>, as well as in Snu71p, Prp42p, Snu56p and Nam8p of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, predict that these proteins are putative RNA-binding proteins, suggesting that they may be involved in intron recognition. The strong divergence of these proteins is consistent with the observation that introns in <italic>S. pombe</italic> and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> clearly show organism-specific features, as discussed in the introduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>).</p><p>Based on the results presented here and those published previously, we hypothesize that the proteins U1H, U1J and U1L associated with the U1 snRNP in <italic>S. pombe</italic> are specific proteins involved in intron recognition. Once an intron is defined by a U1 particle, a tetra-snRNP particle consisting of U2, U5 and U4/U6 is recruited to the pre-mRNA, and a splicing-competent spliceosome (penta snRNP) is formed. The formation and activation of a splicing-competent spliceosome involves the phosphorylation of the spliceosomal component Prp1p by Prp4p kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>).</p><p>We have suggested that <italic>S. pombe</italic> represents the archetype of the pre-mRNA splicing machinery in eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). The present study supports this prediction. Here, we extend this prediction to the mechanism of spliceosome activation. All eukaryotic genomes sequenced to date, with the exception of the hemiascomycetes, contain a Prp4p kinase counterpart. Therefore, further analysis using <italic>S. pombe</italic> as a genetically and biochemically amenable organism will help provide insight into the complex mechanisms of pre-mRNA splicing regulation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplementary Material]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="nar_gkl1144_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword" xlink:href="nar_gkl1144_gkl1144-Supplementary_data_F1S_A-B.doc"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword" xlink:href="nar_gkl1144_gkl1144-Supplementary_data_F2S.doc"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword" xlink:href="nar_gkl1144_gkl1144-Supplementary_data_F3S.doc"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We thank Dr. Judy Potashkin (Rosalind Franklin University of Medicine and Science, IL, USA) for careful reading of the manuscript, and Susanne Zock-Emmenthal and Kirsten Minkart for their valuable technical assistance.
