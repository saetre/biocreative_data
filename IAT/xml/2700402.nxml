In this study, we examined the structure of purified Nup170 to obtain clues about its function. We show that Nup170 adopts a crescent moon shape with two structurally distinct and separable domains, a &#x003b2;-propeller N terminus and an &#x003b1;-solenoid C terminus. To address the individual roles of each domain, we expressed these domains separately in yeast. Notably, overexpression of the Nup170 C domain was toxic in <italic>nup170&#x00394;</italic> cells and caused accumulation of several Nups in cytoplasmic foci. Further experiments indicated that the C-terminal domain anchors Nup170 to nuclear pores, whereas the N-terminal domain functions to recruit or retain a subset of Nups, including Nup159, Nup188, and Pom34, at nuclear pores. We conclude that Nup170 performs its role as a structural adapter between cytoplasmically oriented Nups and the nuclear pore membrane.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>The nuclear pore complex (NPC) is a supramolecular assembly that is inserted in the nuclear envelope (NE) and mediates nucleocytoplasmic transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fahrenkrog and Aebi, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Tran and Wente, 2006</xref>). The NPC scaffold is characterized by distinct substructures that are arranged with an eightfold rotational symmetry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Stoffler et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beck et al., 2007</xref>). The NPC in the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> is &#x0223c;60 MD in size and consists of multiple copies of &#x0223c;30 different proteins called nucleoporins (Nups; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Rout et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>One of the major structural components of the NPC is Nup170, which is required for the maintenance of a normal NPC structure and is implicated to have a role in NPC biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aitchison et al., 1995</xref>). Nup170 and its highly related homologue Nup157 were identified in a synthetic lethal screen using the nuclear pore membrane protein Pom152. Neither <italic>NUP157</italic> nor <italic>NUP170</italic> are essential, but deletion of both genes caused a lethal phenotype. Genetic analyses showed that a <italic>nup170&#x00394; pom152&#x00394;</italic> double mutant was lethal, whereas the combination <italic>nup157&#x00394; pom152&#x00394;</italic> allowed cell growth. Repression of <italic>NUP170</italic> in a <italic>pom152&#x00394;</italic> background induced the formation of an irregularly shaped NE with massive extensions and invaginations. In addition, structures interpreted as partially assembled NPCs were described in the respective strains to be located below the double membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aitchison et al., 1995</xref>). Nup170 was shown to be required for normal stoichiometry of FG Nups and to be involved in localizing specific FG Nups (e.g., Nup1 and Nup2) within the NPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kenna et al., 1996</xref>). Moreover, Nup170 forms a complex with Nup53 and Nup59 and also associates with the nuclear transport receptor Kap121 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Marelli et al., 1998</xref>). Nup53 itself was shown to interact with Ndc1, which is another nuclear pore membrane protein, suggesting that Nup53 could bridge between the NPC core and the pore membrane, making it a prime candidate to affect both nuclear pore membrane and NPC biogenesis in conjunction with Nup170 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Galy et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mansfeld et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hawryluk-Gara et al., 2008</xref>). Consistent with this possibility, overproduction of Nup53 disturbed NE organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Marelli et al., 2001</xref>). Nup170, as well as Nup188, another large structural Nup, has also been implicated in the control of NPC permeability by altering the diameter for passive diffusion in <italic>nup170&#x00394;</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Shulga et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>Nup157 and Nup170, both belonging to the large structural Nups, are predicted to contain an N-terminal &#x003b2;-propeller and a C-terminal &#x003b1;-solenoid domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Devos et al., 2006</xref>). Although both proteins are highly similar and have overlapping functions, they also have unique roles. For example, Nup170 is involved in chromosome segregation and kinetochore function, which was not found for Nup157 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kerscher et al., 2001</xref>). Recently, Nup170 was suggested to be located adjacent to the center of the nuclear membrane curvature and thus could play a role in the buildup of the NPC scaffold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alber et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Knowledge of a detailed structural buildup of Nups at the atomic level is still limited, although x-ray structures of scaffold NPC components are emerging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hodel et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berke et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Weirich et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Melcak et al., 2007</xref>). The largest structure so far of a single Nup (Nic96) was solved recently and showed deviations from the predicted &#x003b1;-solenoid fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jeudy and Schwartz, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Schrader et al., 2008</xref>). Structural analysis of full-length Nups was only performed by EM, and a first 3D reconstruction of Nup157 revealed a crescent-shape structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lutzmann et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we determined the structure of full-length Nup170 by EM. Nup170 has a crescent-shaped morphology with two structurally distinct and separable domains. The overproduction of the C-terminal domain of Nup170 induces a toxic phenotype in <italic>nup170&#x00394;</italic> cells. Concomitant to Nup170C overexpression, several other Nups, including Nup159, Nup82, Nup188, and Pom34, were mislocalized to cytoplasmic foci. This toxicity of Nup170C was reversed by coexpression of Nup170N, which led to an interaction between both domains and assembly into intact NPCs. Our data provide insight into the anatomy of a large structural Nup with respect to domain organization, NPC targeting and maintenance, and stability of the NPC.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><sec><title>Nup170 has a crescent-shaped structure</title><p>To gain insight into the Nup170 morphology with respect to the arrangement of the structurally predicted N and C domains, we sought to determine its 3D structure by EM. Expression and purification of Nup170 from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> was not possible because the recombinant protein had the tendency to aggregate. However, a functional Nup170 protein genomically tagged with protein A&#x02013;tobacco etch virus (TEV)&#x02013;Flag could efficiently be purified from yeast with only a minor contamination of fatty acid synthase (FAS; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>, left). This purified Nup170 was subjected to EM analysis by performing negative staining with uranyl acetate and imaging under low dose conditions.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Electron microscopic single-particle analysis of purified full-length Nup170 and Nup170C.</bold> (A) Affinity-purified Nup170 was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining (left; contaminated by FAS and indicated by an asterisk) and by EM (right).

Because of its characteristic morphology, the FAS did not interfere with the subsequent image processing. The particle images revealed different views of Nup170 without a preferential orientation, ranging from a globular to a crescent-like morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>, right). For the calculation of a 3D map, a series of micrographs were recorded, and particle images were selected from the micrographs and aligned to sets of multiple references. Alignment to selected classes followed by classification was repeated until stable classes were obtained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>, top row). We assumed that these class averages corresponded to different projections of a unique 3D shape, and, consequently, the class averages were combined to a 3D map by back projection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>, middle and bottom rows). The accuracy of the map was tested by comparison of the class averages and the related reprojections of the 3D map. For the displayed volume, the class averages agreed reasonably well with the corresponding reprojections.</p><p>The calculated 3D structure revealed that Nup170 has a crescent-shaped morphology with one end of the crescent being significantly thicker than the other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, B and C</xref>; and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200810016/DC1">Video 1</ext-link>). The overall dimensions of the particle were 13 nm in length and 8 nm in width. The morphology of Nup170 determined in this study resembles that of Nup157 with a similar crescent shape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lutzmann et al., 2005</xref>). Superposition of the volumes of Nup170 and Nup157 showed the same curvature between the thicker end and the rest of the particle for both Nups, with the thinner end being somewhat longer in Nup170. Considering the general problems of reconstructing structures of low molecular weight complexes, the differences in the details of the maps of Nup157 and Nup170 most likely reflect inaccuracies in the image reconstructions rather than genuine differences in the architecture of the both molecules, which are highly homologous.</p><p>Next, we determined the EM structure of the C-terminal domain of Nup170. In this case, protein A&#x02013;tagged Nup170C (residues 755&#x02013;1,502) was expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> and purified to homogeneity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>). Nup170C was significantly shorter than full-length Nup170 but still exhibited the characteristic bending (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>). However, the prominent mass present on the thick arm of the full-length Nup170 crescent was absent in Nup170C, suggesting that this part corresponds to the Nup170 N domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>). Consistent with this interpretation, the predicted N-terminal &#x003b2;-propeller and the C-terminal &#x003b1;-solenoid domain of Nup170 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Devos et al., 2006</xref>) could be manually fitted, respectively, into the bulbous end and the rest of the bend structure of the full-length Nup170 EM volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>). Altogether, the structural data suggest that the C domain of Nup170 can fold independently from the N domain and thus could perform separate functions.</p></sec><sec><title>Overexpression of the Nup170 C domain is toxic but can be rescued by coexpression of either Nup170N or Nup157N</title><p>To find out whether distinct functions can be assigned to the Nup170 N and C domains, we expressed the separate domains in yeast. <italic>NUP170</italic> is not essential in yeast, and <italic>nup170&#x00394;</italic> cells have a mildly impaired cell growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aitchison et al., 1995</xref>).

Besides this predominant NPC location, Nup170C-GFP was occasionally seen in a cytoplasmic spot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>; see next section).

These findings indicate that Nup170C did not assemble into NPCs in the presence of chromosomal <italic>NUP170</italic>, suggesting that endogenous Nup170 competes with Nup170C for a binding site in the NPC. Nup170C is incorporated into NPCs in the absence of endogenous Nup170, pointing to the importance of the &#x003b1;-solenoid in anchoring Nup170 to the NPC.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>Nup170C and Nup170N physically and functionally interact with each other.</bold> (A) Nup170C tethers Nup170N to the NE.

When Nup170C was overexpressed, the transmembrane Nups Pom34-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>) and Pom152-GFP (not depicted) also became mislocalized into the cytoplasm, but rather in a single spot than several foci as observed for Nup188-GFP. Double fluorescence microscopy revealed that the cytoplasmic foci containing CFP-marked Nup188 or Nup159 tend to colocalize with the ER membrane marker Sec61-YFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>). Thus, the cytoplasmic Nup foci induced by Nup170C overproduction are either associated with or close to the membranes containing the ER marker Sec61.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p><bold>Overproduction of Nup170C induces a cytoplasmic mislocalization of Nups.</bold> Nup82, Nup188, Pom34, and Nup2, all labeled with GFP at the C terminus by chromosomal integration, were expressed in the wild-type, <italic>nup170&#x00394;</italic>, and <italic>GAL&#x02237;NUP170C</italic>-overproducing <italic>nup170&#x00394;</italic> strains.

Thus, overproduction of Nup170C affects NPC tethering of Nup1 and Nup2 differently than a <italic>nup170&#x00394;</italic> deletion, which was reported to cause a partial mislocalization of these nucleoplasmic Nups from NPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kenna et al., 1996</xref>).</p><p>Next, we examined the cells expressing the toxic Nup170C by transmission EM. This analysis revealed electron-dense structures in the cytoplasm that resembled NPCs present in the NE (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200810016/DC1">Fig. S2</ext-link>). However, the diameter of these electron-dense cytoplasmic structures (87 &#x000b1; 9 nm) was slightly smaller than the size of normal NPCs embedded in the NE (97 &#x000b1; 11 nm). Thus, it remains open whether the Nup-containing cytoplasmic foci induced by Nup170C overexpression and seen in the fluorescence microscope correspond to these electron-dense structures seen in EM.</p><p>In conclusion, the EM structure of Nup170 revealed that it is composed of two distinct structural entities, which is consistent with the predicted domain separation into an N-terminal &#x003b2;-propeller and a C-terminal &#x003b1;-solenoid. These domains fulfill different functions: the C-terminal part anchors Nup170 to the nuclear pore, and the N terminus is responsible for recruiting and/or retaining certain Nups at the NPCs. Moreover, the overexpression of the Nup170 C-terminal domain generated a toxic phenotype in <italic>nup170&#x00394;</italic> but not <italic>NUP170</italic> cells, which caused a subset of Nups to mislocalize into cytoplasmic foci. In addition, Nup170C overexpression induced nuclear accumulation of poly(A)<sup>+</sup> RNA in a significant number of cells, which was not seen in <italic>nup170&#x00394;</italic> cells (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200810016/DC1">Fig. S3</ext-link>). Until now, such an effect of a toxic mutant Nup, which is not seen by its full-length nonessential counterpart, has not been observed. Among the mislocalized Nups were Nups predicted to form the NPC scaffold (Nup188), transmembrane Nups (Pom152 and Pom34), and Nups from the cytoplasmic periphery (Nup159 and Nup82). However, no segregation into cytoplasmic foci was observed for Nups located at the nuclear side of the NPC (Nup1 and Nup2). This finding could implicate that the N terminus of Nup170 (or Nup157) may tether cytoplasmically oriented Nups to the C terminus of Nup170 molecules within the context of the higher order NPC structure.</p><p>Under conditions of Nup170C overexpression, the cytoplasmic foci containing GFP-labeled Nups (e.g., Nup188-GFP) sometimes aligned like pearls on a string protruding from the NE. It is possible that the Nup170C domain in concert with other Nups (e.g., Pom34, Pom152, and Nup188) triggers distinct steps in NPC biogenesis that could occur outside of the NE, perhaps at the ER. This possibility is consistent with identified interactions between Pom152 and Nup170 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alber et al., 2007</xref>) and Nup188 and Pom152 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aitchison et al., 1995</xref>). Assuming that these Nup assembly intermediates are first formed outside of the NE, the Nup170N domain may help to target these intermediates to the sites within the nuclear membrane, where the new NPCs form. An evolutionary conserved subcomplex containing Nup170/Nup155 and especially the Nup170-Nup53 assembly has been shown to be crucial for NPC and NE assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hawryluk-Gara et al., 2008</xref>). We have found a two-hybrid interaction between the N-terminal domain of Nup170 and Nup53 (unpublished data). Thus, it is possible that upon Nup170C overexpression in yeast, the subcomplex containing Nup170 and Nup53 may not be correctly assembled, and, as a consequence, NPC biogenesis is inhibited. Future studies will be necessary to reveal the composition and exact subcellular location of the observed putative NPC intermediates in the cytoplasm and unravel the precise role of the Nup170 N and C domains in orchestrating both temporally and spatially the complicated steps of NPC biogenesis.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="Materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Yeast strains and yeast genetic methods</title><p>The plasmids used in this study are shown in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200810016/DC1">Table S1</ext-link>.
