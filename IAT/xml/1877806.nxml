Consistent with this, mutations in Rb are associated with numerous types of cancer making it a critical tumour suppressor gene. Its function is conferred through a large multiprotein complex that exhibits a dual function in both activation and repression of gene targets.

While screening for genes that affect the ability of the intestinal cells to appropriately make this cell cycle transition during post-embryonic development, we isolated mutants that either compromise this switch and remain mononucleate, or cause these cells to undergo multiple rounds of nuclear division. Among these mutants we identified a novel allele of <italic>lin-35/</italic>Rb, while we also found that the components of the synMuv B complex, which are involved in vulval specification, are also required to properly regulate the developmentally-controlled cell cycle transition typical of these intestinal cells during larval development. More importantly, our work uncovered a role for certain members of the pathways involved in RNAi in mediating the efficient transition between these cell cycle programs, suggesting that <italic>lin-35</italic>/Rb cooperates with these RNAi components. Furthermore, our findings suggest that <italic>met-2</italic>, a methyltransferase as well as <italic>hpl-1 </italic>and <italic>hpl-2</italic>, two <italic>C. elegans </italic>homologues of the heterochromatin protein HP1 are also required for this transition.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our findings are consistent with <italic>lin-35</italic>/Rb, synMuv and RNAi components cooperating, probably through their additive effects on chromatin modification, to appropriately modulate the expression of genes that are required to switch from the karyokinesis cell cycle to endoreplication; a highly specified growth pathway in the intestinal epithelium. The <italic>lin-35/Rb </italic>repressor complex may be required to initiate this process, while components of the RNAi machinery positively reinforce this repression.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Multicellular organisms must continuously integrate information from the developmental program in order to appropriately coordinate cell divisions with cell fate specification to generate functional tissues and organs. These developmental cues often impinge directly on key positive and/or negative regulators of the cell cycle. Although other levels of regulation exist, in many cell types the critical point resides with the decision to execute S phase. Several key growth-promoting signal transduction pathways have been implicated in this decision, most of which act upon the levels or the activity of cyclin D/CDK4/6 complexes during G1 phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Perhaps the best characterized among the many important substrates of this kinase is the tumor suppressor gene Rb, which was originally identified as a gene commonly mutated in rare heritable retinoblastomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Since its initial identification, this gene product has been implicated in many different types of cancer and compromise of its function may be one of the most common events preceding the onset of tumorigenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Rb is an important negative regulator of cell growth and proliferation and orthologues have been identified in most metazoans from <italic>C. elegans </italic>to humans and more recently in plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. These proteins possess a characteristic "pocket domain" that is required for their essential tumor suppressor activities. Initially, Rb was described as a negative regulator of the S-phase specific transcription factor E2F and through its action maintains the cell in G1 phase. The tumor suppressor function associated with Rb may, at least in part, be mediated through this important property. However, our understanding of the role of Rb and the related pocket proteins has expanded and it appears that their functions are not confined to regulating the cell cycle. Rather, the pocket-containing proteins are now known to play important roles other than in cell cycle regulation in several developmental contexts in many different organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>A developmental role of Rb became apparent following the analysis of Rb -/- mice that died early during embryogenesis from various developmental abnormalities which were difficult to account for solely based on cell cycle defects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Subsequently, Rb was found to associate with known key transcription factors required for organ specification, thus confirming the role of Rb in regulating genes required for other essential cellular processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The Rb/E2F/DP1 complex not only plays an important developmental role in mice, but its developmental role is also conserved in invertebrates. In <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, microarray experiments have revealed that several key developmental regulators appear to be targets of E2F and Rb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>In <italic>C. elegans, lin-35 </italic>is the only predicted Rb/pocket protein orthologue and it acts redundantly with additional gene products in several developmental contexts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. During embryogenesis, <italic>lin-35</italic>/Rb cooperates with components of the ubiquitin conjugation machinery to specify appropriate pharyngeal morphogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Genetic analysis of vulva development has also shown that <italic>lin-35/</italic>Rb is required in the hypodermis rather than in the vulval cells themselves to suppress the ability of the vulval progenitors to respond to sub-threshold <italic>ras </italic>signalling thereby ensuring the correct patterning of the organ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Because of the redundant pathways that cooperate with Rb to control these transcriptional outcomes in the vulva, the mutants in these pathways have been referred to as <underline>syn</underline>thetic <underline>Mu</underline>lti<underline>v</underline>ulval or synMuv. At present, three different classes of synMuv genes have been characterized based on their genetic interactions and are referred to as either synMuv A, B or C, all of which act in parallel to appropriately pattern the vulva [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. <italic>lin-35</italic>/Rb was initially characterized as a synMuv B gene, as were the E2F orthologue <italic>efl-1 </italic>and its binding partner <italic>dpl-1 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Not unexpectedly, many of the synMuv B genes are involved in various aspects of transcriptional control.</p><p>Biochemical and genetic evidence suggests that Rb does not only sequester E2F transcription factors at the G1 phase of the cell cycle, but it also forms a functional repressor complex with E2F and its DNA-binding partner DP, in addition to several other proteins that together repress the expression of genes at various points during the cell cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The notion that Rb, E2F and DP reside together in a complex involved in modulating gene expression was further supported when components of a functional <italic>myb </italic>transcription factor-containing complex were identified in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Among the associated polypeptides identified in this complex were the <italic>Drosophila </italic>synMuv B orthologues, suggesting that these proteins form a functional complex that represses gene expression in various developmental contexts in different organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Further evidence in support of a repressive function for the Rb complex was provided from findings that demonstrated that Rb interacts directly with Suv39h, a methyltransferase specific for lysine 9 on histone 3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. This methylated lysine creates a binding site for the heterochromatin protein HP1, which promotes the formation of heterochromatin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Therefore, the tumor suppressor function of Rb proteins may equally depend on their ability to repress the expression of key developmental genes in cooperation with E2F and DP, in addition to its well-characterized role in regulating E2F activity for the expression of the repertoire of genes associated with the onset of S-phase.</p><p>In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the <italic>lin-35</italic>/Rb complex was demonstrated to regulate cell division in the intestinal lineage by cooperating with <italic>cki-1/-2</italic>, two cyclin-dependant kinase inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. However, it was not clear at what level <italic>lin-35/</italic>Rb was required, particularly since the intestinal cells undergo 3 different invariant cell divisions during their development. Since these transitions are under developmental control, we conducted a forward genetic screen to identify genes involved in determining appropriate transitions between these different cell cycles typical of the intestine during post-embryonic development of <italic>C. elegans</italic>. We identified several mutants, one of which results from a mutation in <italic>lin-35/Rb </italic>that affects the ability of the intestinal cells to initiate endocycles at the appropriate time during development. In addition to the canonical transcriptional regulators that constitute the synMuv B family, we also found that <italic>met-2</italic>, a predicted methyltransferase, and <italic>hpl-1 </italic>as well as <italic>hpl-2</italic>, two heterochromatin protein-like (<italic>hpl</italic>) that bind methylated histone, also enhance the <italic>lin-35 </italic>mutant phenotype in the intestine. Our data are consistent with <italic>lin-35/Rb </italic>and its associated synMuv B partners being involved in the regulation of gene expression associated with this cell cycle transition.</p><p>Moreover, further genetic analysis indicated that the Rb pathway interacts genetically with components of the various RNAi pathways, suggesting that these pathways function additively to regulate the expression of key genes that underlie this developmentally-regulated cell cycle transition. Taken altogether our data provide a link between the synMuv B repressor complex, the RNAi pathways, and chromatin modification in regulating this developmentally-controlled cell cycle transition during post-embryonic development.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and Discussion</title><p>The intestinal cells of <italic>C. elegans </italic>execute three different types of cell cycle to give rise to a functional gut in the growing larva. During embryogenesis, the E blastomere undergoes 5 successive rounds of mitotic division which are controlled by both positive and negative cell cycle regulators that are contributed maternally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Following embryogenesis, the intestine is highly differentiated and functional to allow the animal to ingest nutrients and therefore initiate larval development. However the larva, as well as the intestinal cells, must continue to grow as the animal progresses through post-embryonic development. This represents a fundamental problem for the animal, as terminal differentiation and cell proliferation are generally mutually exclusive cellular states. To circumvent this, the cells execute a single nuclear division during the first larval stage and then execute "endocycles", where they fully duplicate their genome without undergoing cytokinesis in order to coordinate their growth with the feeding larva, while still maintaining a fully differentiated and functional gut.</p><p>Using an intestinal-specific GFP marker (<italic>elt-2::GFP</italic>) to isolate mutants with an aberrant number of intestinal nuclei we have previously shown that appropriate activity of <italic>cki-1</italic>, the <italic>C. elegans </italic>p21/27-like cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor and the positive S-phase regulator <italic>cdc-25.1 </italic>are critical to control cell divisions in the intestinal cells during embryogenesis, without any effect on the post-embryonic nuclear divisions or endocycles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. In a similar screen performed to identify genes involved in the post-embryonic cell cycle transitions we isolated five mutants that either possess fewer intestinal nuclei than wild-type (<italic>rr42, rr43 </italic>and <italic>rr44</italic>, class 1 mutants), or more than the wild-type complement of intestinal nuclei (<italic>rr33 </italic>and <italic>rr45</italic>, class 2 mutants) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Initial characterization of these mutants indicated that they all exhibit a maternal effect, with the exception of <italic>rr45</italic>. The mutants that give rise to extra intestinal nuclei, <italic>rr33 </italic>and <italic>rr45</italic>, are temperature sensitive and produce only a few eggs before they become sterile when transferred to restrictive temperature (25&#x000b0;C). Some of these embryos hatch, but these larvae arrest post-embryonic development before the L2 stage. Both class 1 and 2 mutants hatch with the wild-type number of intestinal cells (20 cells) (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>), indicating that these mutations do not affect embryonic divisions, unlike <italic>cki-1 </italic>or <italic>cdc25.1(gf)</italic>, but they specifically affect the post-embryonic nuclear divisions.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Two classes of mutants with altered numbers of intestinal nuclei.

First, we found that <italic>rr33 </italic>and <italic>rr45 </italic>double mutants are synthetically lethal, suggesting that the genes affected in these two mutants are part of the same essential cellular process, or that they affect two parallel but inter-dependent pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. We also found that class 1 mutations (less intestinal nuclei than wild-type) suppress both class 2 mutations (more intestinal nuclei-<italic>rr33 </italic>and <italic>rr45</italic>), albeit to different degrees suggesting that the genes encoded by class 1 mutations may be epistatic to those of class 2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Although at present we have not uncovered the molecular identity of these mutated genes, the phenotype of class 1 mutants strongly resembles that of gene products involved in the LIN-5 complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. The LIN-5 complex is required during the first cell division to generate force at the mitotic spindle. However, the intestinal cells in hypomorphic alleles of <italic>lin-5 </italic>mutant are not able to perform the nuclear division at the L1 stage and remain mononucleate. Consistent with this, we found that <italic>lin-5 </italic>is also epistatic to <italic>rr33</italic>, much like our class 1 mutants (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). At present, our mapping data indicate that these mutations do not correspond to any of the known <italic>lin-5 </italic>complex components (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Therefore our class 1 mutants may be implicated in a previously undescribed <italic>lin-5</italic>/<italic>GPR</italic>-related pathway(s) for generating force required for the nuclear divisions that occur in the intestine during the first larval stage (L1).</p><sec><title><italic>rr33 </italic>is a mutation in the Retinoblastoma (Rb) gene orthologue <italic>lin-35</italic></title><p>The class 2 mutants <italic>rr33 </italic>and <italic>rr45 </italic>have similar phenotypes that include supernumerary intestinal nuclei that arise postembryonically. We mapped the <italic>rr33 </italic>mutation to a small interval on chromosome I (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>), while <italic>rr45 </italic>maps to chromosome IV. Using the feeding RNAi library we tested all the predicted genes in the region to identify candidates, which upon loss-of-function, would phenocopy the <italic>rr33 </italic>mutant phenotype in wild-type animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>].

Mutations in synMuv B genes cause a multivulval (Muv) phenotype only when combined with a class A or C synMuv mutation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Mapping and cloning of the <italic>rr33 </italic>mutant.

Therefore, based on RNAi data, sequence analysis of the <italic>rr33 </italic>mutation, transformation rescue, as well as its ability to produce a synMuv phenotype, we conclude that <italic>rr33 </italic>is a novel allele of <italic>lin-35 </italic>and will be herein referred to as <italic>lin-35(rr33)</italic>.</p><p>Previous findings showed that the reference allele <italic>lin-35(n745) </italic>had no intestinal nuclear division phenotype alone, but acted synergistically with <italic>cki-1/cki-2 </italic>to give rise to extra intestinal cells/nuclei [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. However, this does not seem to be the case as both the reference allele <italic>lin-35(n745) </italic>and this novel allele <italic>lin-35(rr33) </italic>increase the number of intestinal nuclei quite substantially above the wild-type complement in the absence of any other background mutation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].

However, classical tests could not be performed because no deficiencies are currently available that uncover the <italic>lin-35 </italic>locus. The presence of a stop codon motivated us to look at the abundance of the mRNA, as aberrant transcripts are usually degraded by nonsense mediated decay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Using semi-quantitative RT-PCR, we were able to detect <italic>lin-35 </italic>mRNA in <italic>lin-35(rr33) </italic>mutants at levels comparable to wild-type (data not shown). This result suggests that even if the <italic>rr33 </italic>mutation introduces a stop codon, the mRNA is not degraded through the nonsense mediated decay pathway. Also, even if the reference allele of <italic>lin-35, n745</italic>, also introduces a stop codon at the same position (opal rather than the amber stop found in <italic>rr33</italic>), the intestinal phenotype is more pronounced in <italic>lin-35(n745) </italic>compared to <italic>lin-35(rr33) </italic>(56.3 &#x000b1; 4.7, n = 21 intestinal nuclei compared to 50.7 &#x000b1; 4.7, n = 38 respectively). This difference between these two alleles is likely due to the varying capacity of readthrough associated with the two different stop codons. In support of this, we can recapitulate the embryonic lethality typical of both alleles when maintained at 25&#x000b0;C by injecting <italic>lin-35 </italic>dsRNA in a <italic>lin-35(rr33) </italic>mutant reared at permissive temperature (40.5 &#x000b1; 21.1 % embryonic lethality compared to 2.2% embryonic lethality in uninjected <italic>lin-35(rr33) </italic>mutant, n = 10). Our data therefore suggest that <italic>lin-35 </italic>is an essential gene and neither of these alleles act as null mutations at 20&#x000b0;C, presumably due to readthrough.</p><p>It was recently shown that <italic>lin-35</italic>/Rb and probably all the other components of the synMuv B complex are required in the hypodermal cells rather than in the vulva cells to prevent inappropriate ras activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Because of this cell non-autonomous effect of <italic>lin-35/</italic>Rb in the vulva cells, we wanted to test if <italic>lin-35 </italic>is required autonomously in the intestinal cells to regulate this cell cycle transition. To address this we expressed a rescuing <italic>lin-35 </italic>cDNA specifically in the intestinal cells using the <italic>elt-2 </italic>promoter in a <italic>lin-35(rr33) </italic>mutant background. We observed that animals that carry the transgene have 32.6 &#x000b1; 2.8 intestinal nuclei compared to 29.3 &#x000b1; 1.8 for wild-type.

In contrast, the <italic>lin-35(rr33) </italic>mutant adult intestine possesses ~50 intestinal nuclei. This defect does not occur embryonically since mutant larvae hatch with the normal complement of intestinal cells/nuclei (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Therefore we performed lineage analysis on <italic>lin-35(rr33) </italic>mutants to determine when these extra intestinal nuclei arise during post-embryonic development. We found that in <italic>lin-35(rr33) </italic>mutants the L1-specific nuclear divisions that occur in intestinal rings 3&#x02013;9 (Int3-9) are essentially identical to wild-type and the intestinal cells become binucleate (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). However, <italic>lin-35(rr33) </italic>mutants undergo a supernumerary round of nuclear division in the posterior intestinal cells in the early L2 stage, just after the normal onset of the endocycle program. However, not all the intestinal cells execute this division (on average, 48.9% of the intestinal cells in each animal are abnormal, n = 20 animals) and there is no bias for any single cell to divide. Moreover, whereas the cells of the Int2 ring never undergo nuclear division in wild-type, these cells will often execute a nuclear division at the L2 stage to become binucleate in the <italic>lin-35(rr33) </italic>mutant background, wherein 22.9% of the <italic>lin-35(rr33) </italic>had at least one divided Int2 cell (n = 20). We interpret these observations to indicate that affected intestinal cells are unable to make the timely transition to endocycles at the L2 molt due to sub-threshold levels of <italic>lin-35</italic>/Rb, thus compromising the appropriate downregulation of specific gene activities. As such, the affected cells undergo an extra round of nuclear division to eventually possess supernumerary intestinal nuclei.</p><p>Previously, <italic>lin-35 </italic>was found to cooperate with <italic>cki-1/2 </italic>to regulate intestinal nuclei numbers in the adult [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. However, the presence of extra intestinal nuclei at the adult can be due to both supernumerary mitotic divisions during embryogenesis or nuclear divisions during post-embryonic development. To confirm that indeed <italic>cki-1 </italic>and <italic>lin-35 </italic>are acting in two distinct developmental processes, we inactivated <italic>cki-1 </italic>by RNAi in wild-type and <italic>lin-35(rr33) </italic>mutant backgrounds and scored the number of intestinal nuclei at both the L1 and adult stage.

Consistent with this hierarchy, we found that the extra nuclear divisions of the <italic>lin-35(rr33) </italic>mutant are suppressed following <italic>cye-1</italic>(RNAi) (data not shown). In order to test this hypothesis, we performed quantitative (q)RT-PCR to determine if any differences in the levels of A, B, D and E type cyclins were detectable in wild-type <italic>vs lin-35(rr33) </italic>mutants.

This is catalyzed predominantly by the methyltransferase Suv39h, which has been implicated in the initiation of heterochromatin formation in several cell types and in different organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>]. Once methylated, heterochromatin proteins (HP) such as HP1 recognize the modification and bind to the methylated histone to induce conformational changes in the chromatin typical of heterochromatin. <italic>C. elegans </italic>has two HP1-like proteins (HPL-1 and HPL-2) and <italic>hpl-2</italic>, but not <italic>hpl-1</italic>, was shown to be a synMuv B gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>]. This suggests that the synMuv B repressor complex may induce chromatin changes by binding target gene promoters, which are subsequently methylated. This step could occur either through direct association of a methyltransferase with the repressor complex, or in a subsequent step in response to its binding. Recently, <italic>met-2</italic>, a predicted meL9H3 methyltransferase, was found to behave as a synMuv B class gene, reinforcing the idea that the synMuv B genes induce transcriptional repression through chromatin modification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>]. Consistent with this, we found that when performed in a <italic>lin-35(rr33) </italic>mutant background, <italic>hpl-1</italic>(RNAi), <italic>hpl-2</italic>(RNAi) as well as <italic>met-2</italic>(RNAi) increased the number of multinucleate intestinal cells 2-, 2.5- and 3-fold, respectively, compared to <italic>lin-35(rr33) </italic>controls (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>). Another closely related methyltransferase, C47F5.1 had no apparent effect on intestinal cell development; cell division or other. This suggests that <italic>met-2 </italic>is likely to be the orthologue of Suv39h and it cooperates with <italic>lin-35</italic>/Rb and <italic>hpl-1</italic>/<italic>hpl-2 </italic>to affect changes in gene expression. These results argue that the LIN-35 repressor complex, which contains the same synMuv B genes required for proper vulva specification, also acts in the intestinal cell to promote this cell cycle transition through chromatin modification.</p><p>More recently, <italic>lin-35 </italic>as well as other synMuv B genes have been found to regulate RNAi sensitivity. The <underline><italic>E</italic></underline>nhancer of <underline><italic>R</italic></underline>NA<underline><italic>i</italic></underline> (<italic>eri</italic>) genes regulate the activity of another less well understood process that includes endoRNAi. Exactly how these genes and <italic>lin-35</italic>/Rb may interact mechanistically to regulate the RNAi response is still unclear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">72</xref>]. It has recently been proposed that <italic>dcr-1</italic>, the only <italic>C. elegans </italic>dicer-like RNAse III, and other downstream components of the RNAi machinery might be rate limiting. By mutating any one of the <italic>eri </italic>genes the limiting pool of active <italic>dcr-1</italic>, as well as all the downstream components associated with this pathway, are reallocated to the active RNAi pathways, therefore making them more efficient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">73</xref>].</p><p>Evidence suggests that the <italic>lin-35 </italic>repressor complex is also involved in a pathway that depends on the availability of RNAi components, but is unlikely to be involved in any functional aspect of the <italic>eri </italic>class of genes. First, double mutant combinations of <italic>lin-35 </italic>and any of the <italic>eri </italic>genes tested were shown to be more sensitive to RNAi than any single mutant, suggesting that they act cooperatively and potentially in parallel pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">72</xref>]. Curiously, <italic>lin-35; eri-3 or lin-35; rrf-3 </italic>have a near wild-type complement of intestinal nuclei compared to <italic>lin-35 </italic>mutants alone, suggesting that genes in the Eri pathway can suppress the defects in the number of intestinal nuclei of the <italic>lin-35 </italic>mutant (35.2 &#x000b1; 3.4 and 33.8 &#x000b1; 2.5 respectively compared to 50.3 &#x000b1; 4.7 for <italic>lin-35(rr33) </italic>mutant alone). We suggest that in an Eri background where the endoRNAi pathway has been disabled, RNAi limiting factors are reallocated to the synMuv B/<italic>lin-35 </italic>repressor pathway, therefore making it more efficient. We propose that the same process may be true to account for the enhancement of RNAi by mutation in the synMuv B components as it permits the reallocation of limiting levels of RNAi components to function in the exoRNAi pathway, therefore making it more efficient. Our results show that <italic>dcr-1</italic>(RNAi) enhances the <italic>lin-35(rr33) </italic>mutant phenotype and that by genetically increasing the availability of RNAi components to function in the synMuv B pathway we rescue the <italic>lin-35 </italic>mutant phenotype in the gut. We therefore propose that the synMuv B pathway requires <italic>dcr-1 </italic>activity, in addition to other downstream RNAi components, to properly repress gene expression, potentially through a <italic>met-2</italic>-directed chromatin modification.</p></sec><sec><title>A model for developmentally-regulated cell cycle transitions in the intestine</title><p>Based on our results and those of others, we propose the following model to describe how the intestinal cell divisions are controlled during <italic>C. elegans </italic>development (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6A</xref>). From the specification of the E blastomere early during development at the 12-cell stage up to the end of embryogenesis, this precursor intestinal cell will go through five successive rounds of mitosis to give rise to 20 intestinal cells at the hatch. This is controlled by the activity of <italic>cki-1 </italic>and perhaps other general cell cycle regulators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>Genetic regulation of cell cycle progression in the intestinal lineage of <italic>C. elegans</italic>.

The E blastomere is marked with a white asterisk as the transgene is not expressed at this early stage. The different types of intestinal cell cycle are marked under the schematic life cycle and the arrows indicate the developmental stage during which they occur. Black rectangles represent each molt. Anterior is up in all the figures and all the images are shown at the same magnification to represent the growth of the animal. (B) Proposed model for the <italic>lin-35</italic>/synMuv B complex in the regulation of the cell cycle transitions typical of the intestinal cell lineage during the L1 stage. See the text for details.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-213X-7-38-6"/></fig><p>Subsequently, the posterior intestinal cells will perform a single round of nuclear division (karyokinesis) at the end of the L1 stage to become binucleate. Based on the intestinal mutant phenotype of <italic>rr42, rr43 </italic>and <italic>rr44 </italic>as well as the <italic>lin-5 </italic>complex, this intestinal division is likely to be positively regulated by these genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Following these nuclear divisions, all the intestinal cells perform successive rounds of endoreplication at each larval molt to become polyploid by the adult stage. We and others have shown that the transition from karyokinesis to endoreplication is controlled by the <italic>lin-35/Rb </italic>repressor complex, as well as a subclass of the RNAi components (This study and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]). The defect in intestinal cell cycle transition caused by <italic>alg-1/alg-2 </italic>is at least partially due to its involvement in the correct processing of <italic>lin-4</italic>, which in turn is required for <italic>lin-14 </italic>downregulation at the end of the L1 stage. The gene product of <italic>cyd-1</italic>, <italic>cye-1 </italic>and the heterochronic gene <italic>lin-4 </italic>were also shown to cause defects in the transition from karyokinesis to endoreplication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Lastly, a group of genes, like <italic>cye-1 </italic>and <italic>fzr-1</italic>, are required for endocycling in the intestinal cells in conjunction with each molt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">74</xref>].</p><p>Based on our data, we suggest that the <italic>lin-35 </italic>repressor complex is required during the L1 molt to initiate the repression of specific genes to allow the cell cycle transition typical of this lineage. Then, through a currently uncharacterised mechanism, the production of a dsRNA molecule specific for these genes takes place, the products of which will feed into the RNAi pathway. Through the action of <italic>dcr-1</italic>, these dsRNA molecules will generate siRNA specific for these gene products that will feed back to the chromosome to recruit <italic>met-2 </italic>and promote the methylation of lysine 9 on histone 3. Once methylated, both <italic>hpl-1 </italic>and <italic>hpl-2 </italic>induce the formation of heterochromatin to stably silence these genes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>). This mode of regulation may be analogous to the silencing process observed in yeast (<italic>S. pombe</italic>) and vertebrate cells where heterochromatin is established at the centromere through a dsRNA-based mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have shown that the simple switch from a proliferative mode of cell cycle to one that is more consistent with growth of the differentiated cells during development is under very strict control and that the aberrant gene expression associated with loss of either the Rb and/or the RNAi pathway can lead to defects in this switch. Although the importance of <italic>lin-35/Rb </italic>in regulating the cyclins implicated in this transition has been highlighted, most of the targets of the <italic>lin-35</italic>/Rb/RNAi pathways are yet to be elucidated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Precisely how the components of the RNAi pathway and Rb coordinate these processes still remains to be characterized, but understanding how these factors contribute to the tumor suppressor function of Rb will indeed be paramount.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Genetics</title><p>All strains were cultured according to Brenner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">75</xref>].
