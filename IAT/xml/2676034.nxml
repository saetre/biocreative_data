To analyze the activity of familial Alzheimer disease mutants and to understand the roles of the subunits, we established a yeast transcriptional activator Gal4p system with artificial &#x003b3;-secretase substrates containing amyloid precursor protein or Notch fragments. The &#x003b3;-secretase activities were evaluated by transcriptional activation of reporter genes upon Gal4p release from the membrane-bound substrates, <italic>i.e.</italic> growth of yeast on histidine and adenine, or &#x003b2;-galactosidase assay. We screened and evaluated &#x003b3;-secretase mutants using this reconstitution system in yeast, which does not possess endogenous &#x003b3;-secretase activity. When we introduced familial Alzheimer mutants of PS1 in this system, their activities were shown to be loss of function. Although the protease activity of wild type PS1 depends on the other three subunits introduced, we obtained 15 new PS1 mutants, which are active in the absence of NCT. They possessed a S438P mutation at the ninth transmembrane domain (TM9) together with one missense mutation distributed through transmembrane and loop regions. These mutations were not related to familial Alzheimer mutations of PS1 as identified so far. The S438P mutant was partially active but required other mutations for full activation. Results of the &#x003b2;-galactosidase assay suggested that they have wild type protease activities, which were further confirmed by the endoproteolysis of PS1, amyloid &#x003b2; peptides, and Notch intracellular domain production in mammalian cells. These results suggest that NCT is dispensable for the protease activity of &#x003b3;-secretase.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><label>*</label><p>This work was supported by research grants from <grant-sponsor>Human Frontier Science Program</grant-sponsor> and the <grant-sponsor>Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare</grant-sponsor>, Japan (to S.

Abnormal processing of APP produces a small amyloid &#x003b2; fragment (A&#x003b2;42), possibly responsible for Alzheimer disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>). &#x003b3;-Secretase is composed of four membrane proteins as follows: presenilin (PS; PS1 or PS2), nicastrin (NCT), anterior pharynx-1 (Aph-1), and presenilin enhancer-2 (Pen2), which are necessary for the protease activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>). PS contains nine transmembrane domains (TM1 through TM9) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>), whereas Aph-1, Pen2, and NCT contain seven, two, and one, respectively. PS is believed to be the subunit with aspartyl protease activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>). More than 100 human missense mutations in PS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>) increased the production of A&#x003b2;42 peptides, and they are associated with early onset familial Alzheimer disease (FAD). NCT interacts with the luminal region of the APP fragments, leading to the hypothesis that NCT functions as a substrate acceptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>). On the other hand, Pen2 triggers the endoproteolysis of PS into amino- and carboxyl-terminal fragments (called NTF and CTF, respectively) as a part of the maturation of the protease complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>). Aph-1 is thought to be a scaffold for the assembly and contributes to the stability of the entire complex and its trafficking to the Golgi apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>).</p><p>The interactions between the subunits and the arrangement of PS1 transmembrane domains were partly understood from biochemical analyses. The carboxyl-terminal region (including TM8 and TM9) and TM4 of PS1 interact with NCT (or Aph-1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>) and Pen2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>), respectively. In addition to the substrate-binding site in NCT, Kornilova <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>) proposed that PS1 contains a substrate recognition and a catalytic site. Prior to the entry into the catalytic site, the substrate interacts with the recognition site (also called docking site), which may be identical to the binding sites of APP and telencephalin (TM1 and the carboxyl-terminal region containing TM9) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>). The catalytic site of PS1 was further analyzed by cysteine scanning mutagenesis; TM6 and TM7 form water-containing cavities inside the membrane with two functional Asp residues (Asp<sup>257</sup> and Asp<sup>385</sup>, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>)) located very closely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>). The TM9 and a hydrophobic domain between TM6 and TM7 were also shown to be nearby (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>).</p><p>The structural arrangements of &#x003b3;-secretase subunits were known at least partially (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>). However, the catalytic mechanism has yet to be understood, including the roles of NCT, Aph-1, and Pen2 to trigger protease activity. Signal peptide peptidases (SPP and SPP-like proteases) were found to be structural homologues of PS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>). They have two conserved Asp residues for the aspartyl protease activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>), and cleave membrane-embedded signal peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>) or type II membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>). SPP shares a series of inhibitors with &#x003b3;-secretase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>), suggesting that SPP and PS have similar catalytic sites. Although they are similar in protease activity, SPP does not require additional subunit(s) for activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>). Thus, &#x003b3;-secretase subunits, NCT, Aph-1, and Pen2 may not be required for proteolysis itself. To address this question, it is of interest to test whether mutations in PS1 can suppress the lack of other subunits.</p><p>Edbauer <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>) indicated that the four subunits are essential for protease activity using the yeast transcriptional activator Gal4 system with artificial &#x003b3;-secretase substrate (C1&#x02013;55-Gal4p), which contains APP fragment. We extended this system for analyzing the FAD mutants of PS1 and the roles of &#x003b3;-secretase subunits. We screened and evaluated &#x003b3;-secretase mutants in yeast, which does not possess functional homologues of the protease complex. PS1 FAD mutants were shown to be loss of function in the yeast system similar to mammalian cells. Furthermore, we isolated 15 new PS1 mutants, which do not require NCT to proteolyze the Gal4-fused substrates and endoproteolyze PS1 itself in the yeast system. They contain a common S438P mutation in TM9, together with one missense mutation found in TM1, TM3, TM5, TM6, TM8, TM9, and loop regions. These mutations were not related to the FAD mutations of PS1. Using mouse embryonic fibroblasts with PS knock-out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>) or NCT knock-out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>), we could show that these mutant PS1s becomes mature form by endoproteolysis, producing A&#x003b2; and Notch intracellular domain (NICD) in the absence of NCT. These observations suggest that PS1 with the critical S438P mutation in TM9 does not require the substrate receptor NCT for the protease activity.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><p>&#x003b3;<italic>-Secretase and APP Constructs</italic>&#x02014;The expression constructs for &#x003b3;-secretase were prepared as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>) with minor modifications.

The mutant still required Aph-1 and Pen2 for growth (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>A</italic></xref>) and possesses two missense mutations, F411Y and S438P, mapped at TM8 and TM9 transmembrane segments, respectively. When we prepared cells with each replacement, F411Y did not grow and S438P grew partially (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>B</italic></xref>), indicating that the two mutations are necessary for full activation of growth. &#x003b2;-Galactosidase activity showed that the F411Y/S438P mutant possesses wild type activities in the absence of NCT (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>C</italic></xref>). The S438P single mutant had slight &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>C</italic></xref>), suggesting the partial activation. These results suggest that &#x003b3;-secretase with PS1 F411Y/S438P mutation can be active in the absence of NCT.</p><p><italic>S438P Mutation Is Important for the PS1 Activation</italic>&#x02014;To further assess the PS1 mutation, we have replaced Phe<sup>411</sup> and Ser<sup>438</sup> residues randomly. None of the possible combinations gave the same growth as the original F411Y/S438P (supplemental Table 1). However, single S438P replacement or those with F411G, F411P, F411A, F411I, F411M, and F411V could grow slightly but significantly on SD-LWHUAde media, suggesting that they are partially active without NCT (supplemental Table 1). To obtain more mutants similar to F411Y/S438P, we further screened mutants by introducing random mutations into PS1 having F411Y or S438P replacement (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). We obtained 41 and 47 positive clones from F411Y and S438P, respectively. 40 of those from F411Y were the original F411Y/S438P mutants (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>A</italic></xref>). One exception had three replacements V236M/F428Y/F411Y (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>B</italic></xref>). These results indicate that the S438P is pertinent for the activity of the PS1 mutants. Starting from S438P, we obtained various replacements localized in TM1, TM3, TM5, TM6, TM8, and TM9, and loop regions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref> and <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3<italic>A</italic></xref>). These mutations did not have consistent change in amino acid residues such as from acidic to neutral or from hydrophobic to hydrophilic, suggesting that the secondary mutations are less critical than S438P.</p><p><table-wrap position="float" id="tbl2"><label>TABLE 2</label><caption><p><bold>Screening for PS1 mutants active without NCT</bold></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="center" valign="top"><bold>Mutants</bold></th><th colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="center" valign="top"><bold>No. of positive clones</bold></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="left" valign="top"><bold>Screening (3.7 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> cells tested) from PS1 F411Y mutant</bold></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="right" valign="top"/></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="left" valign="top"> &#x02002;&#x02002;&#x02002;F411Y/S438P (the original mutant) </td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="right" valign="top"> 40 </td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="left" valign="top"> &#x02002;&#x02002;&#x02002;V236M/F428Y/F411Y </td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="right" valign="top"> 1 </td></tr></tbody><tbody><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="left" valign="top"><bold>Screening (3.7 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> cells tested) from PS1 S438P mutant</bold></td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="right" valign="top"/></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="left" valign="top"> &#x02002;&#x02002;&#x02002;M84K/S438P </td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="right" valign="top"> 1 </td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="left" valign="top"> &#x02002;&#x02002;&#x02002;Y115F/S438P </td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="right" valign="top"> 2 </td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="left" valign="top"> &#x02002;&#x02002;&#x02002;L173V/S438P </td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="right" valign="top"> 1 </td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="left" valign="top"> &#x02002;&#x02002;&#x02002;L232H/S438P </td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="right" valign="top"> 2 </td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="left" valign="top"> &#x02002;&#x02002;&#x02002;L232F/S438P </td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="right" valign="top"> 1 </td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="left" valign="top"> &#x02002;&#x02002;&#x02002;V236A/S438P </td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="right" valign="top"> 4 </td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="left" valign="top"> &#x02002;&#x02002;&#x02002;V236M/S438P </td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="right" valign="top"> 13 </td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="left" valign="top"> &#x02002;&#x02002;&#x02002;L241I/S438P </td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="right" valign="top"> 1 </td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="left" valign="top"> &#x02002;&#x02002;&#x02002;A246T/S438P </td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="right" valign="top"> 8 </td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="left" valign="top"> &#x02002;&#x02002;&#x02002;V252M/S438P </td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="right" valign="top"> 1 </td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="left" valign="top"> &#x02002;&#x02002;&#x02002;D403G/S438P </td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="right" valign="top"> 2 </td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="left" valign="top"> &#x02002;&#x02002;&#x02002;F411Y/S438P (the original mutant) </td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="right" valign="top"> 3 </td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="left" valign="top"> &#x02002;&#x02002;&#x02002;I416F/S438P </td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="right" valign="top"> 1 </td></tr><tr><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="left" valign="top"> &#x02002;&#x02002;&#x02002;F441L/S438P </td><td colspan="1" rowspan="1" align="right" valign="top"> 7 </td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p>We also replaced catalytic Asp<sup>385</sup> in combination with F411Y/S438P.

The functions of these subunits have yet to be understood. To address this problem, we have expressed the &#x003b3;-secretase in yeast and screened PS1 mutants, which do not require other subunits for the protease activity. Fifteen mutants did not require NCT and exhibited wild type activity to cleave APP (C1&#x02013;55)-Gal4p or NotchTM-Gal4p, and to endoproteolyze. Protease activity of these mutants was further confirmed by the endoproteolysis, the A&#x003b2; production from APP (C1&#x02013;99), and the NICD production from Notch-1 (N<sup>&#x00394;E</sup>) in mouse fibroblasts. This finding led us to study the roles of trans-membrane helices of PS1, as discussed below.</p><p><fig position="float" id="fig5"><label>FIGURE 5.</label><caption><p><bold>Endoproteolysis, A&#x003b2;, and NICD production by F411Y/S438P mutant in mouse embryonic fibroblasts.</bold><italic>A,</italic> PS double knock-out cells were transiently transfected with C1&#x02013;99pcDNA, PS1pcDNA3.1/Zeo, or F411Y/S438PpcDNA3. 1/Zeo, and siRNA for NCT or control siRNA (<italic>cont. siRNA</italic>), as indicated.

All of the mutants had S438P substitution together with a missense mutation, except that one had three replacements, V236M/F428Y/F411Y. The Ser<sup>438</sup> is localized in the middle of the TM9, and its replacement to Pro residue may change the structure of the trans-membrane domain and induce flexibility, because Pro is a known &#x003b1;-helix breaker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref44">44</xref>). Activation of the S438P mutant in the absence of NCT correlates with the proposed role of TM9 for the binding of the substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>) and the interaction with NCT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>). The Ser<sup>438</sup> residue is conserved through PS1/PS2 of all species so far sequenced and locates very close to the motif (<underline>Pro</underline>-<underline>Ala</underline>-<underline>Leu</underline>-Pro-Ile-<bold>Ser</bold>, Pro<sup>433</sup> to Ser<sup>438</sup>, in human residue numbers). It should also be noted that Pro-Ala-Leu (PAL motif, underlined above) is completely conserved among PS1, PS2, and SPP, and the mutation in the motif abolishes the &#x003b3;-secretase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>) and NCT binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>). Thus, the S438P mutation obviously affected the location of PAL motif. Recent cross-linking experiments indicated that the PAL motif and Ser<sup>438</sup> exist very close to the catalytic Asp<sup>257</sup> residue in TM6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>). Tolia <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>) show that TM9 exhibits a highly flexible structure and propose that it may be involved in the transport of the substrates to the catalytic site. They suggest that TM6 (Asp<sup>257</sup>), TM7 (Asp<sup>385</sup>), TM9 (the PAL motif and Ser<sup>438</sup>), and the hydrophobic region between TM6 and TM7 (hydrophobic domain VII) form a catalytic cavity. We propose that the S438P mutation changed the structure of the recognition site, which facilitates the substrate entry into the catalytic site.</p><p><fig position="float" id="fig6"><label>FIGURE 6.</label><caption><p><bold>F411Y/S438P mutant forms &#x003b3;-secretase complexes in yeast.</bold><italic>A,</italic> microsomes from yeast transformants with PS1 wild type, NCT, Aph-1-HA, and FLAG-Pen2 were solubilized with buffer containing 1% CHAPSO. &#x003b3;-Secretase complex was purified from the extracts using the antibody against PS1-loop region (G1L3) or rabbit preimmune serum, as indicated.

However, additional single mutation was required for full protease activity. The secondary mutations are distributed through TM1, TM3, TM5, TM6, TM8, TM9, and loop regions. Among them, A246T and V252M may directly change the position of the catalytic Asp<sup>257</sup> in TM6, and F411Y and I416F may change the structure of TM8, which interacts with Aph-1 and NCT. Immunoprecipitation experiments confirmed that F411Y/S438P mutant forms a complex with Aph-1 and Pen2 even in the absence of NCT. Pen2 binds to the pre-formed complex with PS1, Aph-1, and NCT and enhances the endoproteolysis upon maturation of &#x003b3;-secretase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>). The interaction between the PS1 mutant and Pen2 may explain why the mutant was activated in the absence of NCT. Pen2 interacts with the TM4 of PS1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>). Thus, S438P and other mutations may change structural arrangement of TM4 and enhance the interaction between PS1 catalytic site and Pen2 in the absence of NCT.</p><p>Immunochemical results indicated that the mutant PS1, F411Y/S438P, became a mature form by endoproteolysis in yeast in the absence of NCT. The ratio of the endoproteolyzed fragments to PS1 increased with the mutant, suggesting that the mutant has higher endoproteolytic activity than wild type. In mammalian fibroblast cells, the mutant PS1 also endoproteolyzed in the absence of NCT. However, the production of the mature fragments was lower than that with NCT. This may be because the mutant is unstable or inactivated in fibroblast cells. It was shown that PS1 is degraded by proteasome in the absence of NCT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>).</p><p>When we observed the cleavage of the C1&#x02013;99 fragment <italic>in vitro</italic> using solubilized yeast microsomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref>), we could detect neither A&#x003b2; nor AICD production by the F411Y/S438P mutant in the absence of NCT. The &#x003b3;-secretase assay system required the CHAPSO solubilization of membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref>). The activity of F411Y/S438P mutant in the absence of NCT may be sensitive to detergents. Because it is difficult to detect A&#x003b2; or AICD production in yeast whole cells (lysate or media), we further tested the C1&#x02013;99 cleavage in mammalian whole cell assays.</p><p>Using the mouse embryonic fibroblast cells, we observed the A&#x003b2; and NICD production by the PS1 mutant, F411Y/S438P, in the absence of NCT, confirming its activity to cleave Gal4p-fused substrates. The processing of the physiological substrates (C1&#x02013;99 or N<sup>&#x00394;E</sup>) in mammalian cells confirms that the mutant complex is active &#x003b3;-secretase in the absence of NCT. Although F411Y/S438P mutant possessed the wild type activity to process Gal4-fused substrates in yeast, the A&#x003b2; or NICD production by F411Y/S438P mutant was low compared with the wild type PS1 with NCT in fibroblasts. When we tested the stability of F411Y/S438P by the cycloheximide chase experiment, we observed that the mature form of the mutant (CTF) is unstable (supplemental Fig. S2) compared with wild type PS1. This result corroborates the low activity of the mutant PS1. On the other hand, the subcellular localization of the mutant was tested by the sucrose gradient sedimentation. The wild type and the mutant PS1 were detected in the Golgi, the endoplasmic reticulum, and the plasma membrane fractions (supplemental Fig. S3). Distribution of PS1 CTF was similar between wild type and F411Y/S438P (supplemental Fig. S3), suggesting that the cleavage reaction may occur in similar organella. After extensive screening, we could isolate no PS1 mutant active in the absence of Pen2 or Aph-1. Because fully active PS1 without NCT required two amino acid replacements, those active without Pen2 or Aph-1 may also require multiple mutations. If that is the case, the screenings were not genetically saturated. Further screening is under way for PS1 mutants active without Aph-1 or Pen2 focusing mainly on the similarities between PS1 and its structural homologue SPP. The analyses of the FAD mutants of PS1 showed that G384A and L166P are loss of function like the active site mutant D385A. Using the yeast Gal4 assay, all FAD mutants showed reduced activity compared with the wild type. It is noteworthy that none of them had elevated protease activity. These results support the loss of function pathology of PS1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>). As tested so far, all the PS1 FAD mutants required NCT for its activity. Using <italic>in vitro</italic> &#x003b3;-secretase assay with yeast microsomes, we found that wild type PS1 produces A&#x003b2;40, A&#x003b2;42, and A&#x003b2;43 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref38">38</xref>). It is of interest to analyze the abnormal production of toxic A&#x003b2;42 from the FAD mutant in yeast.</p><p>&#x003b3;-Secretase is a prominent drug target for Alzheimer disease. However, its growing list of substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>), including developmentally indispensable Notch, have rendered inhibitor design challenging. Recently, one PS1 mutant, I437C in TM9, was found to block the A&#x003b2; production but not the Notch processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>), suggesting that TM9 may contribute to substrate specificity. On the other hand, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs were found to modulate the protease function and block the A&#x003b2;42 production without affecting the Notch processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref45">45</xref>). We have developed two artificial substrates with APP or Notch in yeast. The yeast system has possibilities of drug search. It will be a great tool to screen mutations, genes, and drugs, which specifically block the A&#x003b2; production.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplemental Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="M807653200_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="M807653200_1.pdf"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="M807653200_2.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Dr. Takeshi Iwatsubo and Dr. Taisuke Tomita (University of Tokyo) for PS1 antisera and Pen2 and Aph-1 clones; Dr. Takaomi C.
