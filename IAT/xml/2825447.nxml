Although endothelial cells are covered with a glycocalyx, little is known about how endothelial glycosylation regulates endothelial functions. Here, we show that &#x003b1;2,6-sialic acid is necessary for the cell-surface residency of platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM), a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily that plays multiple roles in cell adhesion, mechanical stress sensing, antiapoptosis, and angiogenesis. As a possible underlying mechanism, we found that the homophilic interactions of PECAM in endothelial cells were dependent on &#x003b1;2,6-sialic acid. We also found that the absence of &#x003b1;2,6-sialic acid down-regulated the tyrosine phosphorylation of PECAM and recruitment of Src homology 2 domain-containing protein-tyrosine phosphatase 2 and rendered the cells more prone to mitochondrion-dependent apoptosis, as evaluated using PECAM- deficient endothelial cells. The present findings open up a new possibility that modulation of glycosylation could be one of the promising strategies for regulating angiogenesis.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Apoptosis</kwd><kwd>Carbohydrate/Glycoprotein</kwd><kwd>Glycoproteins/Carbohydrates</kwd><kwd>Glycoproteins/Surface</kwd><kwd>Glycosylation</kwd><kwd>Signal Transduction/Phosphotyrosine</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="CS100">National Institutes of Health</funding-source><award-id rid="CS100">HL57345</award-id></award-group></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Angiogenesis is a physiological process that encompasses the growth of capillary blood vessels, and the disturbance of angiogenesis contributes to the pathogenesis of numerous disorders, including cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Indeed, different types of antiangiogenic agents targeting endothelial cells have been developed as anticancer treatments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Pathological angiogenesis is predominantly driven by vascular endothelial growth factor, a proangiogenic growth factor expressed by many solid tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Angiogenesis is also regulated by endothelial cell adhesion molecules, such as vascular endothelial cadherin (VE-cadherin),<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN3"><sup>2</sup></xref> integrins, and platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM). For integrin activation, a mechanosensory complex composed of PECAM, VE-cadherin, and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 causes the initial response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). PECAM was originally identified as a major endothelial cell adhesion molecule, but it has recently been recognized to play important roles in controlling the activation and survival of endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). PECAM is considered to be an inhibitory receptor, and its cytoplasmic region possesses an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif that becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated and subsequently recruits and activates Src homology 2 domain-containing protein-tyrosine phosphatase 2 (SHP2) for the transduction of inhibitory signals to the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Notably, recent studies have shown that PECAM functions as an inhibitor of mitochondrion-dependent apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9 B10 B11">&#x02013;</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>) and regulates pathological angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>).</p><p>Even though most endothelial cell adhesion molecules, including PECAM, are heavily glycosylated, the aspect of how endothelial glycans play roles in vascular physiology and pathology remains largely unknown. The previous observations that vascular endothelial cells express glycoproteins significantly modified with &#x003b1;2,6-linked sialic acid by the &#x003b2;-galactoside sialyltransferase ST6Gal I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>) and that cytokine treatments enhance ST6Gal I expression in endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>) prompted us to study the functional roles of &#x003b1;2,6-linked sialic acid in normal and pathogenic angiogenesis. In this study using ST6Gal I-deficient mice, we demonstrate that in the absence of &#x003b1;2,6-sialic acid, PECAM was unable to remain on the cell surface and incompletely transduced inhibitory signals such as those required for its antiapoptotic role.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><sec><title/><sec><title/><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title><p>The sources of the materials used in this study were as follows: tissue culture media and reagents, including Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium/F-12, from Invitrogen; FuGENE 6 and recombinant <italic>N</italic>-glycosidase F from Roche Applied Science; protein A-Sepharose Fast Flow from GE Healthcare; protein molecular weight standards from Bio-Rad; and all other chemicals from Sigma or Wako Chemicals.

First, we performed immunohistochemical analyses of brain sections from wild-type and ST6Gal I-deficient mice using an anti-ST6Gal I antibody or TJA-I lectin that recognizes Sia&#x003b1;2,6Gal&#x003b2;1,4GlcNAc residues. In the brain sections from wild-type mice, blood vessels were exclusively detected by TJA-I lectin, because all of the TJA-I positive signals were perfectly matched with those of PECAM as an endothelial marker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>A</italic>). The specificity of the TJA-I staining was confirmed by the fact that this staining was totally abolished in the brain sections from ST6Gal I-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>B</italic>). Furthermore, we found that ST6Gal I itself was exclusively detected in the blood vessels. Our findings that ST6Gal I products were not present in the brain parenchyma are consistent with a previous report that brain <italic>N</italic>-glycans predominantly carry &#x003b1;2,3-linked sialic acid, with little or no &#x003b1;2,6-linked sialic acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Even though ST6Gal I-deficient mice grow normally and exhibit no tissue abnormalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>), immunostaining of PECAM was also abolished in the brain sections from ST6Gal I-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>B</italic>). We confirmed that PECAM itself contained &#x003b1;2,6-linked sialic acid residues added by ST6Gal I, because agarose coupled with the Sia&#x003b1;2,6-Gal-binding SSA lectin pulled down almost all of the PECAM in tissue lysates from wild-type mice but was unable to pull down PECAM in tissue lysates from ST6Gal I-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>C</italic>), in which PECAM was modified with other types of sialic acids (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M109.073106/DC1">supplemental Fig. S1</ext-link>). Because the glycosylation-independent anti-PECAM antibody raised against a peptide at the C terminus of PECAM did not stain the brain sections from ST6Gal I-deficient mice (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M109.073106/DC1">supplemental Fig. S2</ext-link>), defective PECAM glycosylation was not related to this result. On the contrary, the levels of PECAM mRNA were almost the same in the two types of mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>D</italic>). Furthermore, Western blot analyses of tissue lysates from ST6Gal I-deficient mice revealed that the total level of PECAM was reduced to only about 70% of the normal level in the lung (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>E</italic>).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>FIGURE 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Altered PECAM expression in ST6Gal I-deficient mice.</bold><italic>A</italic>, brain sections from wild-type mice were stained with the Sia&#x003b1;2,6Gal-binding TJA-I lectin and an anti-PECAM antibody (MEC13.3) and then observed by confocal fluorescence microscopy.

Even though the total PECAM level was not affected by this ST6Gal I overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>B</italic>), the cell-surface PECAM was increased to &#x0223c;140% in response to the increased cell-surface &#x003b1;2,6-linked sialic acid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>, <italic>A</italic> and <italic>C</italic>). In addition, PECAM immunoreactivity was detected in tissue sections from ST6Gal I-deficient mice after autoclave treatment for antigen retrieval (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M109.073106/DC1">supplemental Fig. S2</ext-link>). Because the level of cell-surface VE-cadherin, which contains &#x003b1;2,6-linked sialic acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>), was not affected by ST6Gal I overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref><italic>C</italic>), there appeared to be selectivity for the correlation between ST6Gal I expression and the cell-surface residency of membrane glycoproteins. To explore the intracellular behavior of endothelial PECAM, we isolated liver sinusoidal endothelial cells from the livers of wild-type and ST6Gal I-deficient mice using an established method (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M109.073106/DC1">supplemental Fig. S3</ext-link>). Immunostaining analyses revealed that PECAM was localized at the cell borders in the endothelial cells from wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>A</italic>, <italic>left panels</italic>). In the ST6Gal I-deficient cells, however, this junctional PECAM localization was absent and instead an increased level of intracellular PECAM was colocalized with the early endosome marker EEA-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>A</italic>, <italic>right panels</italic>) and the late endosome marker lysobisphosphatidic acid (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/M109.073106/DC1">supplemental Fig. S4</ext-link>). These results indicate that more PECAM was endocytosed under ST6Gal I deficiency. After overexpression of ST6Gal I in ST6Gal I-deficient cells, the intracellular PECAM was returned to the cell borders (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>B</italic>). Based on these results, we suspected that the cell-surface half-life of PECAM was decreased, similar to the case for other <italic>N</italic>-glycan mutations in which the cell-surface expressions of growth factor receptors and glucose transporters are greatly diminished under highly branching GlcNAcT glycosyltransferase deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). The kinetics of the cell-surface retention of PECAM revealed that the PECAM half-life at the cell surface was decreased by 2-fold in the absence of ST6Gal I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref><italic>C</italic>).</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>FIGURE 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Increased cell-surface expression of PECAM after ST6Gal I expression.</bold><italic>A</italic>, transfection of HUVECs was achieved by infection with adenovirus preparations of ST6Gal I (<italic>ST</italic>) or LacZ using 50 plaque-forming units/cell.

Indeed, the level of phosphotyrosine in the endothelial cells from ST6Gal I-deficient mice was significantly higher than that in the corresponding cells from wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref><italic>C</italic>). Even though PECAM is regarded as a multifunctional molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>), several reports have highlighted that PECAM functions as an inhibitor of mitochondrion-dependent apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">&#x02013;</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). We therefore speculated that ST6Gal I deficiency would increase the sensitivity of endothelial cells to mitochondrion-dependent apoptotic stimuli, because of the lack of functional PECAM. To directly examine whether ST6Gal I-deficient endothelial cells were more sensitive to apoptotic stimuli, we treated endothelial cells from wild-type and ST6Gal I-deficient mice with staurosporine, a trigger for mitochondrion-dependent apoptosis. The ST6Gal-deficient endothelial cells were indeed more sensitive to staurosporine treatment than the wild-type endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Fig. 4</xref><italic>D</italic>).</p><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>FIGURE 4.</label><caption><p><bold>ST6Gal I expression is necessary for PECAM to transduce inhibitory signals.</bold><italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic>, PECAM complexes were precipitated from lung lysates from wild-type (<italic>WT</italic>) and ST6Gal I-deficient (<italic>KO</italic>) mice using an anti-PECAM antibody and analyzed with anti-PECAM and anti-phosphotyrosine (<italic>pY</italic>) antibodies (<italic>A</italic>) or anti-SHP2 antibodies (<italic>B</italic>). <italic>C</italic>, endothelial cell lysates (20 &#x003bc;g of protein) from wild-type and ST6Gal I-deficient mice were analyzed by Western blotting using an anti-phosphotyrosine (<italic>pY</italic>) antibody. <italic>D</italic>, primary liver sinusoidal endothelial cells from the livers of wild-type and ST6Gal I-deficient mice were grown on 96-well plates.

Consequently, we performed <italic>in vitro</italic> assays using Fc-tagged PECAM (PECAM-Fc) and His-tagged PECAM (PECAM-His). Fc-PECAM immobilized onto protein A-Sepharose was able to pull down PECAM-His, and this interaction was abolished by sialidase treatment of either or both PECAM-Fc and PECAM-His, or only PECAM-Fc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Fig. 5</xref>, <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic>), thereby providing direct evidence of sialic acid-dependent homophilic PECAM interactions. Because a conserved Arg in the N-terminal Ig domain is essential in sialic acid recognition by Siglec (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>), we constructed the PECAM mutant, PECAM<sub>R90A</sub>, in which highly conserved Arg-90 in the first Ig domain was replaced with Ala.

PECAM with normal sialic acids mediates homophilic interactions at the cell surface to recruit SHP2 phosphatase to transduce inhibitory signals, such as antiapoptotic signals, to the cell. Under ST6Gal I deficiency, PECAM fails to mediate homophilic interactions, thus leading to an inability to transduce signals to the cell. As an underlying mechanism of the sialic acid-based homophilic PECAM interactions, we speculated that PECAM itself would be an &#x003b1;2,6-linked sialic acid-binding protein because PECAM also belongs to the Ig superfamily that includes a subfamily of sialic acid-binding Ig-like lectins (Siglecs). Even though PECAM is not likely to possess an N-terminal V-set Ig domain that plays a role in sialic acid binding in Siglec (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>), replacement of conserved Arg-90 in the first Ig domain of PECAM with Ala greatly reduced the homophilic binding activity, indicating that Arg-90 is an interaction site of PECAM. A detailed molecular structural study to elucidate how and which part of PECAM exhibits its sialic acid-binding activity is a challenging issue for the future.</p><fig id="F6" position="float"><label>FIGURE 6.</label><caption><p><bold>Schematic diagrams of a model for sialic acid-dependent homophilic PECAM interactions.</bold> PECAM proteins modified with sialic acids interact with one another at the cell surface, and subsequently recruit SHP2 to transduce inhibitory signals to the cell (<italic>left</italic>).

Glycan modification of PECAM may be responsible for regulating various pathological situations. Nevertheless, because ST6Gal I acts on various endothelial glycoproteins, the identification of key molecules other than PECAM whose functions are regulated by ST6Gal I remains one of our ongoing projects. Finally, our findings that ST6Gal I-deficient endothelial cells exhibit increased sensitivity to apoptotic signals provide new possibilities for the development of glycan-targeted antiangiogenesis strategies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Supplemental Data</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="supp_285_9_6515__index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="supp_M109.073106_jbc.M109.073106-1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by" id="FN1"><label>*</label><p>This work was supported, in whole or in part, by National Institutes of Health Grant HL57345 (to J.
