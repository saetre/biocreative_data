This maternal-embryonic crosstalk involves local mediators within the uterine microenvironment. We demonstrate that a secreted protein, prokineticin 1 (PROK1), is expressed in the receptive endometrium and during early pregnancy. PROK1 induces expression of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) in endometrial epithelial cells and first trimester decidua <italic>via</italic> a Gq-Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>-cSrc-mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase-mediated pathway. We show that human embryonic chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) induces sequential mRNA expression of PROK1 and LIF in an <italic>in vivo</italic> baboon model, in human endometrial epithelial cells, and in first-trimester decidua. We have used micro RNA constructs targeted to PROK1 to demonstrate that hCG-mediated LIF expression in the endometrium is dependent on prior induction of PROK1. Dual immunohistochemical analysis colocalized expression of the luteinizing hormone/chorionic gonadotropin receptor, PROK1, PROKR1, and LIF to the glandular epithelial cells of the first trimester decidual tissue. PROK1 enhances adhesion of trophoblast cells to fibronectin and laminin matrices, which are mediated predominantly <italic>via</italic> LIF induction.

The secretory phase encompasses a finite period of time or &#x0201c;window&#x0201d; during which the endometrium is optimally receptive for implantation of a blastocyst. After this period, the endometrium becomes refractory to conceptus implantation. The implantation window in humans is predicted to last for &#x0223c;4 d and commences &#x0223c;6 d after the luteinizing hormone (LH) peak in a normal menstrual cycle <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">(1</xref><xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">, 2)</xref>. The endometrial expression of a number of cytokines, chemokines, growth factors, and adhesive molecules is associated with the onset of receptivity. In the event of pregnancy, embryonic human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) maintains corpus luteum-mediated progesterone production, which is essential for the maintenance of early pregnancy. Production of hCG by the blastocyst may also directly regulate expression of endometrial factors that may prolong the period during which the endometrium is receptive <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">(3</xref><xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5)</xref>.</p><p>Recently, the expression of a pleiotropic protein, prokineticin 1 (PROK1), and its receptor, prokineticin receptor 1 (PROKR1), has been characterized in the nonpregnant and early pregnant human endometrium <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">(6</xref><xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">, 7)</xref>.

We therefore sought to investigate whether PROK1-mediated epithelial LIF expression could induce trophoblast adhesion and which components of the extracellular matrix were involved. PROKR1 Ishikawa cells were treated with vehicle or 40 nM PROK1 for 12 h, and conditioned medium was collected. JEG-3 human trophoblast cells were subsequently treated overnight with conditioned medium from vehicle- or PROK1-treated cells or conditioned medium (vehicle- and PROK1-treated) that had been immunoneutralized using 1 &#x003bc;g/ml LIF antibody, or treatment of JEG-3 cells with 100 ng/ml recombinant LIF alone was used as a positive control.

These data suggest that PROK1-mediated LIF expression may enhance trophoblast-endometrium adhesion.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Preimplantation signaling between the developing blastocyst and the endometrium is essential for successful implantation and maintenance of early pregnancy. Endometrial cytokines prepare the endometrium to become receptive to the blastocyst, and increasing evidence suggests that paracrine and juxtacrine signals from the blastocyst can influence the endometrial cytokine milieu and enhance receptivity. Blastocysts are known to secrete various factors (reviewed in ref. <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>) that initiate early embryonic communication with the endometrium. There is evidence that embryonic hCG can influence implantation by regulating the expression of endometrial factors that are important in receptivity, such as endometrial LIF <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">(13</xref><xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">, 18</xref><xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">, 19)</xref>.</p><p>LIF has been shown to be critical in murine implantation <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">(9</xref><xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">, 20)</xref> and has been suggested to have a role in human fertility <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">(21</xref><xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">, 22)</xref>. We have previously demonstrated regulation of a host of implantation-related genes including LIF by PROK1 using gene array analysis <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">(7)</xref>. We demonstrate that the temporal expression of LIF mRNA and protein is regulated by PROK1 in an endometrial epithelial cell line and in first trimester decidual tissue explants. LIF is known to be regulated by cytokines including TNF, IL-1, and TGF-&#x003b2; <italic>via</italic> activation of a signaling cascade involving intracellular calcium, PKC, and MEK <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">(23</xref><xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27)</xref>. To examine whether PROK1 activates LIF expression through a similar pathway, chemical inhibitors of signaling pathway molecules were used. We demonstrate that PROKR1, a Gq-coupled receptor that mediates extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 phosphorylation <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">(7)</xref>, induces LIF expression <italic>via</italic> a cSrc-EGFR-MEK signaling pathway, and is also dependent on intracellular calcium release in both PROKR1 Ishikawa cells and first trimester decidual explants.</p><p>This study demonstrates that hCG mediates both PROK1 and LIF expression with a delay in the peak of LIF expression after the peak in PROK1 expression. By using an inhibitor of protein synthesis, hCG induction of LIF was abolished suggesting the involvement of PROK1 as an intermediate in hCG-mediated LIF expression. Using miRNA constructs targeting PROK1, we confirmed that hCG-stimulated LIF expression is dependent on expression of PROK1. These data provide the first evidence that an intermediate protein, PROK1, is required in hCG-mediated endometrial LIF expression.</p><p>To demonstrate that the data represent an active signaling pathway <italic>in vivo</italic> LH/CG receptor is required to be present and colocalized in the endometrium and decidua to permit up-regulation of PROK1 <italic>via</italic> hCG. We therefore investigated the expression of the LH/CG receptor in our decidua samples using quantitative PCR. The results demonstrated the expression of the receptor in the normal cycling endometrium, with an elevation in expression in first trimester decidua. To demonstrate LH/CG receptor mRNA translation and localization, immunohistochemical analysis of first trimester decidua was performed with an antibody recognizing the full-length receptor. This confirmed protein expression of the receptor with localization to the glandular epithelial cells. Coexpression of PROK1 and LH/CG receptor was demonstrated in first trimester decidual tissue, suggesting potential regulation of PROK1 by hCG <italic>in vivo</italic>. Furthermore, the colocalization of PROKR1 and LIF in first trimester decidual tissue suggests that the pathway we have identified, hCG-LH/CG receptor binding activating PROK1-PROKR1 signaling, is responsible for regulation of LIF expression in human early pregnancy.</p><p>LIF expression was elevated in midsecretory endometrium and during early pregnancy up to wk 7 in first trimester decidua. LIF expression significantly decreased thereafter, in agreement with previous reports that decidual LIF production is decreased in the second trimester compared with that in the first trimester <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">(28)</xref>. Week 8 of pregnancy shows a shift in the phenotype of the trophoblasts from predominantly an anchoring villi to an increase in invasive interstitial trophoblasts <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">(29</xref><xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">, 30)</xref>. By 8 wk of pregnancy the interstitial trophoblasts have invaded to the decidual-myometrial border and during the second trimester, there is a further invasion into the inner myometrium <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">(29</xref><xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">, 30)</xref>. In first trimester trophoblast populations, LIF has been suggested to increase fibronectin production, inhibit gelatinase activity, increase spreading and adhesion, and induce differentiation toward syncytialization <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">(31</xref><xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33)</xref>. Our data confirm a role for LIF in enhancing adhesion of trophoblast cells to fibronectin and laminin mediated <italic>via</italic> PROK1-PROKR1 signaling. At the interface between the chorionic villi and the decidua at the implantation site, a predominantly acellular zone develops, known as Nitabuch&#x02019;s fibrinoid <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">(34)</xref>. This zone is rich in laminin, suggesting that PROK1-induced LIF promotes adhesion of the anchoring trophoblast cells to this layer <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">(35)</xref>. Down-regulation of LIF in decidua after wk 7 of pregnancy may be controlled by the trophoblast as a requirement to reduce adhesion and allow controlled invasion through the decidua. Therefore, PROK1 enhancement of LIF may only be required during early pregnancy before wk 8 of gestation during the establishment of the anchoring villi. In addition, decidualizing stromal cells also produce a pericellular laminin basement membrane that may regulate this process <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">(36)</xref>. The increase in PROK1 and LIF in the midsecretory phase of the menstrual cycle and enhancement before implantation may also regulate trophoblast adhesion. The basal lamina associated with the epithelium increases in thickness during the secretory phase, reaching maximum thickness in the midsecretory phase. The basal lamina consists of collagen type IV with proteoglycan molecules such as laminin and fibronectin <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">(37)</xref>. The thickened basal lamina may provide an important structural scaffold for epithelial and trophoblast attachment. A number of studies suggest that LIF production in fertile women is elevated in the secretory phase of the menstrual cycle compared with that in the proliferative phase of the cycle but is dysregulated in infertile women <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">(22</xref><xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">, 38</xref><xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref><xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40)</xref>. Therefore, disrupted regulation of PROK1 expression and its downstream target LIF may be associated with infertility, spontaneous abortion, and placental abnormalities.</p><p>In conclusion, this study demonstrates that embryonic hCG regulates endometrial PROK1-PROKR1 signaling, which induces expression of LIF <italic>via</italic> induction of intracellular calcium and activation of intracellular phosphorylation cascades. These data support a role for PROK1 in initial blastocyst adhesion to basement membrane matrices and subsequent trophoblast invasion. Dysregulation in the expression of PROK1 and consequently LIF may lead to suboptimal fertility and trophoblast invasion.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Sharon Donaldson and Catherine Murray

Bars represent means &#x000b1; <sc>se</sc> of at least 3 independent experiments. &#x0002a;<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05.
