We have previously reported that the orphan nuclear receptor ERR&#x003b3; activates the <italic>SHP</italic> promoter. In this study, we have found that basic helix&#x02013;loop&#x02013;helix (bHLH) transcription factors, the E2A proteins (E47, E12 and E2/5), activated the human but not the mouse <italic>SHP</italic> promoter. In contrast, the tissue-specific E47 heterodimer partner BETA2 repressed the E47- mediated transactivation of the human <italic>SHP</italic> (<italic>hSHP</italic>) promoter. Using serial deletions and E-box mutant constructs of the <italic>hSHP</italic> promoter, we identified two E-boxes (E6 and E7) as E47-responsive E-boxes, which are not conserved in the mouse <italic>SHP</italic> promoter. Moreover, gel shift, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and northern blot assays demonstrated that E47 directly binds to the <italic>hSHP</italic> promoter <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> and that Id proteins inhibited E47 binding to the <italic>hSHP</italic> promoter. Finally, we found that E47 and steroidogenic factor 1 (SF-1), a regulator of the <italic>SHP</italic> promoter, synergistically activate the human but not the mouse <italic>SHP</italic> promoter. Our findings suggest that the E2A proteins differentially regulate the human and mouse <italic>SHP</italic> promoters and cooperate with orphan nuclear receptor SF-1 for transcriptional activation of the <italic>hSHP</italic> promoter.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The nuclear receptor superfamily is a group of ligand-dependent transcriptional factors that usually contain two functionally independent and conserved domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg906c1">1</xref>). A conserved DNA-binding domain (DBD) allows them to associate directly with specific DNA response elements. A ligand-binding domain (LBD) is required for the binding of small lipophilic molecules, ligands or hormones, and for the transmission of ligand signals to transcriptional responses. The superfamily includes both conventional receptors with known ligands and orphan nuclear receptors that lack specific ligands &#x0005b;for reviews see Evans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg906c2">2</xref>) and Giguere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg906c3">3</xref>)&#x0005d;.</p><p>SHP is one of unique members of the orphan nuclear receptor superfamily that lacks a conventional DBD, but contains a putative LBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg906c4">4</xref>). Various studies have reported that SHP is a repressor of transcriptional activities of a number of nuclear receptors, including both ligand-responsive receptors, such as ER, GR, TR, AR, RAR and RXR, and orphan receptors such as CAR, HNF4&#x003b1;, LRH-1, ERR&#x003b3; and LXR&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg906c4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg906c12">12</xref>). However, SHP was also found to be able to activate the transcriptional activity of PPAR&#x003b3; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg906c13">13</xref>). The very broad range of receptors sensitive to inhibition by SHP suggests a central role for SHP in modulation of nuclear receptor signaling pathways. Recent results demonstrate that SHP can compete with coactivators for binding to the AF-2 surface of nuclear receptors, and a direct transcriptional repression domain contributes to the inhibitory function of SHP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg906c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg906c9">9</xref>). SHP is expressed in a wide variety of tissues, including heart, brain, liver, spleen, adrenal gland, small intestine and pancreas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg906c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg906c14">14</xref>). The <italic>SHP</italic> gene consists of two exons and one intron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg906c15">15</xref>), and <italic>SHP</italic> gene transcription is regulated by several members of the nuclear receptor superfamily, including bile acid receptor FXR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg906c16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg906c18">18</xref>), steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg906c19">19</xref>), HNF4&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg906c20">20</xref>), LRH-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg906c18">18</xref>) and ERR&#x003b3; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg906c11">11</xref>). Moreover, previous reports have suggested that SHP plays a pivotal role in the regulation of cholesterol homeostasis via a bile acid-activated regulatory cascade in the liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg906c16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg906c18">18</xref>). The FXR-mediated <italic>SHP</italic> gene induction has been shown to inhibit the activity of orphan nuclear receptor LRH-1, a positive regulator of cholesterol 7&#x003b1;-hydroxylase (<italic>CYP7A1</italic>) gene expression, which catalyzes the rate-limiting step in bile acid biosynthesis. However, loss-of-function studies of SHP demonstrated that redundant pathways independent of the SHP-mediated pathway are implicated in the negative feedback regulation of bile acid production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg906c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg906c22">22</xref>). It has also been reported that mutations in the <italic>SHP</italic> gene in human are associated with mild hyperinsulinemia and obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg906c14">14</xref>).</p><p>Basic helix&#x02013;loop&#x02013;helix (bHLH) transcription factors comprise a large family of transcription factors, which bind to the specific DNA sequence CANNTG, known as the E-box &#x0005b;reviewed in Massari and Murre (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg906c23">23</xref>)&#x0005d;. The E2A proteins (E47, E12 and E2/5), encoded by the <italic>E2A</italic> gene, are the founder members of the vertebrate class I bHLH proteins (also called E proteins) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg906c24">24</xref>). E2A proteins are all very similar; E12 and E47 proteins differ in their C-terminal bHLH sequences, whereas the differences between the E2/5 and E47 proteins are within their N-terminal sequences. A large body of evidence indicates that the E2A proteins play a central role in tissue-specific gene regulation, usually after their dimerization with tissue-specific class II bHLH proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg906c25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg906c28">28</xref>). Nevertheless, homodimers of E2A proteins are functionally active in B-cell lineages where they participate in the transcriptional regulation of several <italic>Ig</italic> genes. In fact, the products of the <italic>E2A</italic> gene (E12/E47) are required for B-cell differentiation and <italic>Ig</italic> gene rearrangements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg906c29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg906c31">31</xref>). In addition, targeted disruption of the <italic>E2A</italic> gene leads to thymic lymphomas, suggesting that E2A proteins can act as tumor suppressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg906c32">32</xref>). The transcriptional activity of E2A proteins can be negatively regulated by their dimerization with another subclass of HLH factors, the Id proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg906c33">33</xref>). The four Id proteins, Id-1, Id-2, Id-3 and Id-4, identified thus far have only a HLH domain and lack the basic DNA-binding region. Dimerization of Id proteins with bHLH proteins results in the inhibition of DNA binding of bHLH proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg906c34">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg906c38">38</xref>).</p><p>The <italic>SHP</italic> promoter contains several E-box (CANNTG) sequences that are predicted to be bHLH protein response elements, and we investigated whether the bHLH protein subfamily members can regulate the <italic>SHP</italic> promoter. In this study, we demonstrated a preferential effect of E2A proteins (E47, E12 and E2/5) on the human but not the mouse <italic>SHP</italic> promoter. Detailed mapping studies revealed that only two (E6 and E7) of 13 E-box (CANNTG) motifs on the human <italic>SHP</italic> (<italic>hSHP</italic>) promoter are sufficient and necessary for the E47-mediated activation. Gel mobility shift assays and mutation studies confirmed the binding of E47 homodimers to the two E-boxes. In addition, Id-1, Id-2 and Id-3, known as inhibitory proteins of bHLH proteins, repressed E47-mediated transactivation of the <italic>hSHP</italic> promoter. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay and northern blot analysis demonstrated that Id-2 inhibited E47 binding to the <italic>hSHP</italic> promoter <italic>in vivo</italic> and decreased <italic>hSHP</italic> expression. Furthermore, E47-mediated transactivation synergized with SF-1 to activate the <italic>hSHP</italic> promoter. These results suggest that the <italic>E2A</italic> gene products play a key role in the regulation of <italic>hSHP</italic> gene expression and cooperate with orphan nuclear receptor SF-1 for transcriptional activation of the <italic>hSHP</italic> promoter.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plasmids and DNA construction</title><p>The plasmids of CMV4-E47, E12 and E2/5 were kind gifts from Dr Roland Stein. pCMV5-casein kinase (CK) II-&#x003b1; was donated by Dr Michael P.

Among the binding sites for various kinds of transcription factors in the <italic>hSHP</italic> promoter, we found 13 E-box (CANNTG) motifs (designated as E1&#x02013;E13 in human), which are well known binding sites of bHLH transcription factors. We also aligned the mouse <italic>SHP</italic> (<italic>mSHP</italic>) promoter and found 11 E-boxes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg906f1">1</xref>A). To investigate whether bHLH protein members can regulate the <italic>SHP</italic> promoter, we performed a transient transfection assay using the reporter gene containing the &#x02013;2.2 kb to &#x0002b;30 bp sequence of the <italic>hSHP</italic> promoter. We first examined the effects of <italic>E2A</italic> gene products (E2A proteins) including E47, E12 and E2/5, which belong to class I bHLH proteins (also called E proteins), on the <italic>hSHP</italic> promoter. Over-expression of E47, E12 and E2/5 in HepG2 cells strongly activated the <italic>hSHP</italic> promoter in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg906f1">1</xref>B). In HeLa and CV-1 cells, a similar effect of <italic>E2A</italic> gene products on the <italic>hSHP</italic> promoter was observed (data not shown). Unexpectedly, over-expression of E47, E12 and E2/5 had no significant effect on the <italic>mSHP</italic> promoter, although the <italic>mSHP</italic> promoter also contains 11 potential E-boxes, indicating that E47-responsive regions may be present only in the <italic>hSHP</italic> promoter (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg906f1">1</xref>C). Taken together, these results suggest that E2A proteins can be a positive regulator of the <italic>hSHP</italic> promoter and that E2A gene products can differentially regulate the <italic>hSHP</italic> and <italic>mSHP</italic> promoter.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>E2A</italic> gene products are sufficient for the transactivation of the <italic>hSHP</italic> promoter</title><p>It has been reported that E2A proteins are potent transcriptional activators as either homodimers or heterodimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg906c25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg906c31">31</xref>). However, the transcriptional activity of E2A proteins as homodimers or heterodimers is highly specific for the enhancers they stimulate. To investigate whether E2A proteins function as either homodimers or heterodimers on the <italic>hSHP</italic> promoter, we tested the effect of class II bHLH proteins such as BETA2/NeuroD, MyoD and myogenin, which are heterodimer partners of E2A proteins. Interestingly, co-expression of BETA2 with E47 reduced the E47-mediated transactivation of the <italic>hSHP</italic> promoter, whereas overexpression of BETA2 alone had little effect on the basal activity in HepG2 or CV-1 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg906f2">2</xref>A). In contrast, BETA2 and E47 strongly activated the RIPE3 reporter that contains E-box elements from the insulin gene promoter, as previously reported (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg906f2">2</xref>B). Other heterodimer partners of E47, such as MyoD and myogenin, also repressed the E47-mediated transactivation of the <italic>hSHP</italic> promoter (data not shown). These results suggest that <italic>E2A</italic> gene products alone may be sufficient for the transactivation of <italic>hSHP</italic> promoter, and heterodimerizatin of BETA2 with E2A may interfere with E47 homodimer formation or perhaps may even be repressive on the <italic>hSHP</italic> promoter.</p><p>It has been reported that CK II repressed the transcriptional activity of E47 homodimer by inhibiting DNA binding, while the transcriptional activity of E47 heterodimer is enhanced by CK II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg906c41">41</xref>). To further confirm whether the activation of the <italic>hSHP</italic> promoter by E47 is due to E2A homodimers or heterodimers, we transiently transfected the CK II expression vector with or without E47 expression vector in HepG2 cells. Over-expression of CK II repressed the E47-dependent transactivation of the reporter gene in a dose-dependent manner, whereas CK II had no significant effect on the basal promoter activity, indicating that E47-dependent transactivation of the <italic>hSHP</italic> promoter may be mediated by E47 homodimers (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg906f2">2</xref>C).</p></sec><sec><title>Identification of two E-boxes (E6 and E7) as E47-responsive E-boxes on the <italic>hSHP</italic> promoter</title><p>In order to map the sequences required for E47-mediated activation, a series of 5&#x02032; deletions of the <italic>hSHP</italic> promoter were used in a transient transfection assay. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg906f3">3</xref>A, E47 responsiveness was retained with a deletion up to &#x02013;574 bp, but was lost with the &#x02013;243 bp construct. In addition, a construct deleted from &#x02013;574 to &#x02013;243 within &#x02013;2.2 kb of the <italic>hSHP</italic> promoter completely lost E47 responsiveness. These results indicate that the sequences required for E47 response lie in the region between &#x02013;574 and &#x02013;243, which contains five E-boxes (from E3 to E7). Notably, four (E3, E4, E6 and E7) out of the five E-boxes are unique to the <italic>hSHP</italic> promoter, while the E5 box is present in human, mouse and rat <italic>SHP</italic> promoters. To further identify E47-responsive E-boxes within this region (&#x02013;574 to &#x02013;243 bp), we made a series of E-box deletion constructs of the <italic>hSHP</italic> promoter as indicated in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg906f3">3</xref>B. In HepG2 and HeLa cells, E47 expression vectors were over-expressed together with the reporter genes driven by a series of E-box deletion constructs of the <italic>hSHP</italic> promoter. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg906f3">3</xref>C and D, E47-dependent activity of the <italic>hSHP</italic> promoter was still detected with further deletion up to &#x02013;355 bp, which contains all seven E-boxes (E1&#x02013;E7). However, the E47-mediated transactivity was markedly decreased by E7 deletion (&#x02013;330 bp) and completely abolished by E6 deletion (&#x02013;280 bp) from the <italic>hSHP</italic> promoter, although the &#x02013;280 bp/Luc reporter contains five intact E-boxes (E1&#x02013;E5). We could not observe E47-dependent activation of the further deletions of the <italic>SHP</italic> promoter, &#x02013;263 bp, &#x02013;250 bp and &#x02013;243 bp/Luc. These results suggest that E47-dependent activation of the <italic>hSHP</italic> promoter is mediated through the &#x02013;355 bp to &#x02013;280 bp region containing the E6 and E7 E-boxes.</p><p>The results from Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg906f3">3</xref>C and D suggested that E47-dependent transactivation of the <italic>hSHP</italic> promoter may be directly mediated by E6 and E7 E-boxes. To address this, a serious of E-box mutants within the &#x02013;2.2 kb <italic>hSHP</italic> promoter was constructed and transiently transfected with E47 expression vectors in HepG2 and HeLa cells. E-box mutant reporters were made by introducing CA to AG substitution mutations into the core E-box (CANNTG) of individual boxes E5, E6 and E7, and double mutation of both E6 and E7 E-boxes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg906f4">4</xref>A and B). As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg906f4">4</xref>C and D, E47-mediated activity was markedly decreased with E7 mutation reporter (mE7/Luc), by &#x0223c;75&#x00025; of the wild-type <italic>hSHP</italic> promoter activity. However, we observed a slight decrease in E47-mediated activity with mE6/Luc, by &#x0223c;30&#x00025; of wild-type reporter activity. Notably, E47-mediated activity was completely abolished with the double E6 and E7 mutant reporter (mE6,7/Luc), although the &#x02013;2.2 kb <italic>hSHP</italic> promoter still contains other intact E-boxes. This observation is consistent with the results from Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg906f3">3</xref>C showing that E47-mediated transactivity was completely abolished by E6 and E7 deletion, although five E-boxes (E1&#x02013;E5) were intact. As expected, the E47-mediated activity of the E5 box mutant (mE5/Luc) was similar to that of the wild-type <italic>hSHP</italic> promoter, in good agreement with the results showing that the <italic>mSHP</italic> promoter was not activated by E47 even though it contains the E5 E-box. Taken together, these results suggest that E47 transactivates the <italic>hSHP</italic> promoter through E-boxes E6 and E7, which are present only in the <italic>hSHP</italic> promoter.</p></sec><sec><title>E47 directly binds to the E6 and E7 E-boxes on the <italic>hSHP</italic> promoter</title><p>To further examine whether E47 directly binds to E6 and E7 E-boxes within the <italic>hSHP</italic> promoter, a series of gel mobility shift assays were conducted using oligonucleotides (&#x02013;342 to &#x02013;312 bp) containing wild-type, individual E6 and E7 E-box mutations (mE6, mE7) and a double E-box mutation (mE6,7) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg906f5">5</xref>A). Unexpectedly, only one band of E47&#x02013;DNA complex was observed, although wild-type probes contain two E-boxes (E6 and E7). In addition, E47 bound to mE6 and mE7, but not mE6,7 double mutant probes, indicating that E47 may not bind to both E6 and E7 E-boxes simultaneously and either the E6 or the E7 E-box is required for E47 binding to the <italic>hSHP</italic> promoter (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg906f5">5</xref>B). To determine to which E-box E47 binds with higher affinity, a series of competition assays were performed using 50- and 100-fold molar excess of unlabeled oligonucleotides of wild-type, mE6, mE7, mE6,7 and control probes from the insulin promoter E-box (RIPE3). As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg906f5">5</xref>C, excess unlabeled oligonucleotides corresponding to wild type and mE6 greatly reduced the E47&#x02013;DNA complex, while excess unlabeled mE7 oligonucleotides only marginally reduced the E47&#x02013;DNA complex, indicating that E47 binds to the E7 E-box with higher affinity than to E6. As expected, mE6,7 had no significant effect on the E47&#x02013;DNA complex, and RIPE3 control inhibited E47&#x02013;DNA complex formation. These results are consistent with our previous observations showing that most of the transactivity of the <italic>hSHP</italic> promoter was decreased by E7 deletion or E7 mutation (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg906f3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg906f4">4</xref>C and D). Taken together, these data suggest that the E7 E-box is preferentially required for E47 binding, although both E-boxes are required for transactivation of the <italic>hSHP</italic> promoter and E47 can bind to either E-box (E6 or E7).</p></sec><sec><title>Id family proteins repress the E47-dependent transactivation of the <italic>hSHP</italic> promoter</title><p>Id family proteins have been well documented to reduce E-box-mediated transactivation. Since Id proteins lack a DBD, dimerization of Id proteins with bHLH proteins results in the inhibition of DNA binding of bHLH proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg906c30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg906c34">34</xref>). To examine whether Id proteins can downregulate the <italic>hSHP</italic> promoter by repressing E47 activity, a transient transfection assay was performed with Id-1, Id-2, Id-3 and E47 expression vectors in HepG2 cells. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg906f6">6</xref>A, Id proteins inhibited E47-mediated transactivation of &#x02013;355 bp <italic>hSHP</italic> reporter gene containing E6 and E7 E-boxes. However, we could not observe any specific inhibitory effect of Id proteins on the &#x02013;243 bp reporter gene deleting E6 and E7 E-boxes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg906f6">6</xref>B). To investigate the effect of Id proteins on the DNA-binding activity of E47 to the <italic>hSHP</italic> promoter, a gel mobility shift assay was performed using the wild-type probe containing E6 and E7. As expected, a molar excess of Id proteins (Id-1, Id-2 and Id-3) reduced the E-box binding affinity of the E47 homodimer, suggesting that Id proteins repress E47-mediated <italic>hSHP</italic> promoter activity by inhibiting E47 binding to E-boxes within the <italic>hSHP</italic> promoter (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg906f6">6</xref>C).</p><p>To further investigate whether E47 binds to the <italic>hSHP</italic> promoter and Id proteins inhibit its binding <italic>in vivo</italic>, we performed a ChIP assay using the PCR primers specific for the &#x02013;474 to &#x02013;120 bp region of the <italic>hSHP</italic> promoter. In HepG2 cells, expression vector encoding HA epitope-tagged E47 was transfected alone or together with expression vector for Id-2, and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with the specific antibody against the HA epitope. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg906f7">7</xref>A, HA-E47 formed a specific complex with the <italic>hSHP</italic> promoter <italic>in vivo</italic> and this interaction was diminished when Id-2 was co-expressed with HA-E47. No bands were observed from cells transfected with either empty vector or Id-2 alone. These results demonstrated that E47 binds to the <italic>SHP</italic> promoter <italic>in vivo</italic> and Id-2 reduced the E47 binding affinity for the <italic>hSHP</italic> promoter (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg906f7">7</xref>A). Previously, it has been reported that <italic>Id</italic> gene expression is induced by serum stimulation and Id proteins are involved in cell cycle progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg906c42">42</xref>). Given that Id-2 can interfere with E47-mediated activation of the <italic>hSHP</italic> promoter, we surmized that inducing expression of endogenous Id-2 might reduce the expression of hSHP mRNA. To this end, total RNA was isolated from HepG2 cells at 0, 1, 3, 6 and 12 h after 20&#x00025; serum stimulation, and northern blot analysis was performed using the cDNA of <italic>SHP</italic>, <italic>Id-2</italic> and <italic>E47</italic> as a probe. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg906f7">7</xref>B, the SHP mRNA level was reduced while <italic>Id-2</italic> gene expression was increased by serum stimulation in a time-dependent manner. However, we could not detect any significant difference in E47 mRNA level by serum stimulation. This inverse relationship might be explained at least partly by the activation of <italic>SHP</italic> expression by E2A proteins, whose activities are inhibited by Id proteins, although <italic>SHP</italic> gene expression can be affected by serum stimulation through other factors. Taken together, these results suggest that Id proteins repress <italic>hSHP</italic> gene expression by interfering with E47 binding to E-boxes.</p></sec><sec><title>Synergistic effects of SF-1 on the E47-medated transactivation of the <italic>hSHP</italic> promoter</title><p>Based on the ChIP assay results showing that over-expressed E47 can bind to the <italic>hSHP</italic> promoter <italic>in vivo</italic>, we investigated whether endogenous E47 transactivates the <italic>hSHP</italic> promoter by comparing the basal promoter activities of wild-type <italic>hSHP</italic> promoter and mutant mE6,7/Luc reporter genes in HepG2 and CV-1 cells. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg906f8">8</xref>A, the basal promoter activity of mE6,7/Luc was drastically reduced to 35&#x00025; of wild-type <italic>hSHP</italic> promoter activity, indicating that endogenous E47 may activate the <italic>hSHP</italic> promoter. It has been reported that the <italic>SHP</italic> promoter is regulated by several orphan nuclear receptors such as SF-1, FXR, LXR, LRH-1, ERR&#x003b3; and HNF4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg906c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg906c16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg906c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg906c43">43</xref>). In addition, we found that SF-1-mediated transactivation of the <italic>hSHP</italic> promoter was also significantly decreased by E6 and E7 E-box mutation, suggesting that E47 might have a significant effect on the SF-1-dependent activation of the <italic>hSHP</italic> promoter (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg906f8">8</xref>A).</p><p>To further investigate whether E47 cross-talks with the transcription factors that regulate the <italic>SHP</italic> promoter, a transient transfection assay was performed with expression vectors for FXR, LXR, SF-1 and ERR&#x003b3; together with E47 expression vectors in CV-1 cells. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg906f8">8</xref>B, E47-mediated transactivation of human but not mouse <italic>SHP</italic> promoter was enhanced synergistically by SF-1 and additively by ERR&#x003b3;. However, FXR, LXR and LRH-1 had no significant effects on the E47-mediated transactivation (data not shown). Interestingly, cooperative activation of the <italic>hSHP</italic> promoter by SF-1 and E47 was completely abolished, although SF-1 activated the mE6,7/Luc reporter gene with E47-responsive E-box mutations within the <italic>hSHP</italic> promoter. In addition, SF-1(&#x00394;AF2), an AF2 deletion mutant, neither activated nor synergistically augmented E47-mediated transactivation of the <italic>hSHP</italic> promoter, suggesting that the AF2 region of SF-1 is indispensable for both transactivation and synergistic activation with E47 of the <italic>hSHP</italic> promoter (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg906f8">8</xref>C). To further investigate whether SF-1 binding to SF-1RE is required for the synergistic effect of E47 and SF-1 on the <italic>hSHP</italic> promoter, CV-1 cells were co-transfected with (523)<sub>4</sub> luciferase reporter plasmids and expression vectors for E47, SF-1 and ERR&#x003b3;. The (523)<sub>4</sub> luciferase reporter contains multiple E-boxes upstream of the luciferase gene and is specific for active homodimers of E47. The result showed that SF-1 and ERR&#x003b3; had no significant effects on the E47-mediated transactivation on the four-copy E-box luciferase reporter, indicating that SF-1 binding is essential for the synergy with E47 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg906f8">8</xref>D). Overall, these results demonstrated that binding to their responsive elements and the AF-2 domain of SF-1 are necessary for synergistic transactivation of the <italic>hSHP</italic> promoter by E47 and SF-1.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Recent reports have identified several nuclear receptors, such as SF-1, LRH-1, HNF4, FXR, ERR&#x003b3; and LXR&#x003b1;, as potent regulators of <italic>SHP</italic> gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg906c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg906c16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg906c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg906c43">43</xref>). However, it has not been fully characterized whether other families of transcription factors regulate <italic>SHP</italic> gene transcription. In this report, we have demonstrated that <italic>E2A</italic> gene products (E47, E12 and E2/5) are novel regulators of <italic>hSHP</italic> gene expression. Interestingly, <italic>E2A</italic> gene products regulate only the human, but not the mouse <italic>SHP</italic> promoter, and two E-boxes (E6 and E7) present only in the <italic>hSHP</italic> promoter are identified as E47-responsive E-boxes. Furthermore, Id proteins downregulate <italic>SHP</italic> gene expression <italic>in vivo</italic> by inhibiting E47 binding to the <italic>SHP</italic> promoter. This study may provide an important insight into <italic>SHP</italic> gene regulation and further into the cross-talk mechanisms of nuclear receptor function with bHLH and Id proteins.</p><p>Transcription factors belonging to the bHLH family are known to regulate a variety of developmental programs, including myogenesis, neurogenesis, sex determination and hematopoiesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg906c27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg906c31">31</xref>). Many of these processes are controlled by E protein homodimer or heterodimer composed of E proteins and tissue-specific bHLH factors such as BETA2, MyoD and myogenin. In this report, we have provided potential evidence that the <italic>hSHP</italic> promoter may be activated by E2A protein homodimers. First, we have shown that over-expression of E2A proteins alone is sufficient to transactivate the <italic>hSHP</italic> promoter in a couple of cell lines such as CV-1, HepG2 and HeLa cells, which originate from different tissues, i.e. kidney, liver and epithelium, respectively. We also observed that class II bHLH proteins, such as BETA2, myogenin and MyoD, inhibited the E2A protein-mediated transactivation of the <italic>hSHP</italic> promoter. These results suggest that tissue-specific class II bHLH proteins may not be required for this activation. In addition, it is reported that CK II acts as a positive regulator of myogenesis and a negative regulator of E protein homodimers by preventing E protein homodimers from binding to E-box elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg906c41">41</xref>). In good agreement with a previous report, we demonstrated that CK II downregulated E47 transactivity on the <italic>hSHP</italic> promoter, indicating that E47 homodimers may be involved in transactivation of the <italic>hSHP</italic> promoter (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg906f5">5</xref>C). Overall, this evidence suggests that E2A proteins alone are sufficient and necessary for the transactivation of the <italic>hSHP</italic> gene, although it is still possible that other tissue-restricted bHLH proteins may be involved in this activation.</p><p>It has been previously reported that ligands for nuclear receptor LXR&#x003b1; activate rat <italic>CYP7A</italic> gene expression via direct binding to LXRE on the rat <italic>CYP7A</italic> promoter. However, the LXR&#x003b1;-binding site is not conserved in the human <italic>CYP7A</italic> promoter and instead LXR&#x003b1; effectively represses the human <italic>CYP7A</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg906c44">44</xref>). Recently, it also has been demonstrated that the repression of human <italic>CYP7A</italic> gene expression by LXR&#x003b1; is due to LXR&#x003b1;-mediated human, but not rat, <italic>SHP</italic> gene induction, which is a negative regulator of <italic>CYP7A</italic> gene expression, suggesting that LXR&#x003b1; activates <italic>hSHP</italic> gene transcription by direct binding to LXRE that is not conserved in the rat <italic>SHP</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg906c43">43</xref>). In this study, we showed that <italic>E2A</italic> gene products regulate human, but not mouse <italic>SHP</italic> gene expression via two E-boxes (E6 and E7) unique to the human gene promoter. These results suggest that E2A proteins may regulate <italic>SHP</italic> gene expression differentially among different species and, in turn, species-specific SHP expression may lead to its distinct functions in various species in an E2A protein-dependent manner. In addition, Id proteins downregulate the E protein-mediated transactivation of the human but not the mouse <italic>SHP</italic> gene. Therefore, we postulate that E2A proteins may indirectly regulate bile acid production, and bHLH proteins and Id proteins can be related to the function of nuclear receptors <italic>in vivo</italic>. It has been demonstrated that Id family proteins repress the transcriptional activity of bHLH proteins by blocking their binding to E-boxes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg906c34">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg906c38">38</xref>). Therefore, we speculated that E47-mediated transactivation of the <italic>hSHP</italic> promoter might be reduced by Id proteins. Expectedly, Id-1, Id-2 and Id-3 repressed the E47-mediated transactivity of <italic>hSHP</italic>, but not <italic>mSHP</italic>, and reduced E47 binding to the <italic>hSHP</italic> promoter <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg906f6">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg906f7">7</xref>). In addition, we demonstrated that SHP mRNA levels were decreased under conditions where Id-2 mRNA levels were increased by serum stimulation, although the E47 expression level showed no significant difference according to serum stimulation. These results suggested that Id proteins downregulate <italic>hSHP</italic> gene expression by repressing the E2A proteins. The notion that the ratio of E2A proteins to class II bHLH and Id proteins is a key regulator of <italic>hSHP</italic> gene expression is supported by the evidence that Id proteins and E2A heterodimer partners, such as class II bHLH proteins, are induced under specific physiological conditions or in a tissue-specific manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg906c25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg906c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg906c34">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg906c38">38</xref>).</p><p>The current study demonstrates that the <italic>SHP</italic> promoter is regulated by SF-1 and ERR&#x003b3; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg906c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg906c19">19</xref>). In addition, it has been reported that SF-1 regulates transcription of the <italic>FSHR</italic> gene via a mechanism that involves USF1 and USF2 binding to the proximal E-box element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg906c45">45</xref>). Herein we demonstrated that E47 and SF-1 stimulate cooperatively the human, but not the mouse <italic>SHP</italic> promoter, supported by the results showing that mutations of the E6 and E7 E-boxes found only in the human promoter eliminated the synergistic effect by E47 and SF-1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg906f8">8</xref>A and B). Interestingly, DNA binding by both E47 and SF-1 within the <italic>hSHP</italic> promoter is indispensable for the cooperative transactivation of the <italic>hSHP</italic> promoter. We also demonstrated the requirement for the AF2 region of SF-1 for both transactivation by SF-1 itself and synergistic activation with E47 of the <italic>hSHP</italic> promoter. This synergistic activation can be mediated by several mechanisms: (i) physical interaction between E47 and SF-1; (ii) recruitment of cofactors; and (iii) enhancement of their DNA binding. We observed that E47 directly interacted with SF-1 and that the A/B-DBDs of SF-1 are involved in the interaction with E47 in a GST pull-down assay (data not shown), suggesting that the synergistic activation can be mediated by direct interaction between them. However, the mechanism by which SF-1 and E47 cooperatively activate the <italic>hSHP</italic> promoter remains to be elucidated. The current results suggest that E47 and synergy with SF-1 could have important effects on a variety of nuclear receptor signaling pathways as a consequence of their effects on <italic>SHP</italic>.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkg906f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><italic>E2A</italic> gene products of bHLH transcription factor activate the <italic>hSHP</italic> promoter.
