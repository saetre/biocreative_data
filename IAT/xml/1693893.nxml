Nervous system polycomb 1 (NSPc1) is a newly identified transcription repressor, highly homologous with PcG protein Bmi-1. In this article, we showed that NSPc1 could promote tumor cell cycle progression and cell proliferation. Semi-quantitative RT&#x02013;PCR showed that NSPc1 did not affect the expression levels of most Cyclin-depentent kinases (CDK) inhibitors except for p21Waf1/Cip1. Repression activity assays, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and DNA pulldown assays all verified that NSPc1 represses the expression of p21Waf1/Cip1 by binding to the (&#x02212;1357 to &#x02212;1083) region of the p21Waf1/Cip1 promoter <italic>in vivo</italic>, and the repression effect is dependent on the retinoid acid response element (RARE element) within the above region of the p21Waf1/Cip1 promoter. Further analysis showed that NSPc1 could compete the RARE element site with RA receptors both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Taken together, our results support the hypothesis that NSPc1 has a positive role in tumor cell growth by down-regulating p21Waf1/Cip1 via the RARE element, which directly connects transcriptional repression of PcGs to CDKIs and RA signaling pathways.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Polycomb group (PcG) Proteins are epigenetical chromatin modifiers that can transcriptionally silence their targets through cell division during development and therefore provide a cellular memory mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>). Since PcG proteins were first discovered in <italic>Drosophila</italic> as the regulator of homeotic (Hox) genes expression, many mammalian homologues of PcG proteins have been identified so far. The mammalian PcG proteins are classified into two major Polycomb Repressive Complexes (PRCs). Among them, Mel-18, Bmi-1, MBLR and NSPc1 are classified into the Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1) based on their structural similarities with the <italic>Posterior sex comb</italic> (<italic>Psc</italic>) of <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). Now accumulated evidence indicates that these mammalian homologues of <italic>Psc</italic> protein may be implicated in cell cycle control, cell proliferation and tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>). For instance, Bmi-1 is a proto-oncogene to induce mouse lymphoma in association with c-myc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>), and Bmi-1 can also promote cell proliferation and stem cells self-renewal by repressing the p16INK4a/p19ARF locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). On the contrary, Mel-18 is a transcriptional negative regulator with tumor suppressor activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>), and could also inhibit the proliferation in differentiated B lymphocytes through a c-myc/cdc25 cascade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>).</p><p>The human NSPc1 gene encodes a protein that shares high homology with Mel-18 and Bmi-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>). Moreover, NSPc1 protein is mainly localized in the nucleus and has a transcription repression activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>). Recently, NSPc1 is identified as one of the genes highly expressed in HCT-116 deprived tumors grown in C.B-17 SCID mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref>), one of the most differentially expressed genes in HeLa cells after camptothecin treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>) and one of the 32 marker genes in kidney cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>). These evidences infer that NSPc1 may play a role in the pathogenesis of tumors. However, until now little is known about whether NSPc1 has a role in tumor cell cycle control and tumorigenesis.</p><p>Cell cycle progression in eukaryotic cells is finely regulated by the sequential activation of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), which are activated after interaction with their corresponding cyclins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>). The activity of these CDKs is restrained by two groups of CDK inhibitors (CDKIs): the INK4 family, which includes CDKN2A/p16 ARF, CDKN2B/p15 INK4B, CDKN2C/p18 INK4C, CDKN2D/p19 INK4D; and the Cip/Kip family, consisting of CDKN1A/p21 CIP1, CDKN1B/p27 KIP1, CDKN1C/p57 KIP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>). The kinase inhibitor p21 Waf1/Cip1 (hereafter p21) retards S phase progression by inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>) and functions as a G2 checkpoint by binding to cyclin B1&#x02013;cdc2 complexes, which are integral in the G2/M transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>). Deregulation in the expression of p21 would be expected to result in abnormal cell proliferation and to predispose the cells to transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>).</p><p>PcGs have been found to repress some negative cell cycle regulators to promote cell cycle transition and cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>). For example, PcG proteins Bmi-1 and Cbx-7 have been identified to regulate cell proliferation by repressing the p16ARF/p19INK4a locus in different tissues and cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>). In the present study, we explored the role of NSPc1 in tumor cell growth regulation and demonstrated that p21 is the direct target gene regulated by NSPc1. The underlying molecular mechanism has also been investigated.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cell culture and transfection</title><p>HeLa or COS-7 cells were maintained in DMEM, SH-SY5Y in RMPI 1640 with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 50 U/ml penicillin, and 50 &#x003bc;g/ml streptomycin under a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO<sub>2</sub> and 95% air at 37&#x000b0;C.

A control set of cells was transfected with empty vector. After 24h of transfection, the growth medium was replaced with fresh DMEM containing all of the supplements listed above, as well as 600 &#x003bc;g/ml G418 (Gibco, USA) in order to select for geneticin-resistant cells. After 2&#x02013;3 weeks of selection, pools of G418-resistant cells, denoted as &#x02018;NSPc1 + V5&#x02019; and &#x02018;V5&#x02019;, respectively, were identified with semi-quantitative RT&#x02013;PCR and western blot. To establish NSPc1 knocked down cell pools, the IMG800-based plasmids (GeneSuppressor system, Imgenex, USA), which contains the human U6 promoter, were constructed as described by the manufacturer <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.imgenex.com"/>. Briefly, several 21-nucleotide sequences within the coding region of NSPc1 were selected as candidates and the PCR amplified fragments were inserted into the IMG800 vector. Final constructs including the region of nt 94&#x02013;114 and nt 515&#x02013;536 were used and named &#x02018;RNAi1&#x02019; and &#x02018;RNAi2&#x02019;, respectively. The two RNAi constructs were then transfected into HeLa cells along with IMG800 empty vector as a control. After 24 h of transfection, the cells were switched to grow in the presence of G418 (600 &#x003bc;g/ml). After 2&#x02013;3 weeks of selection, pools of G418-resistant cells, denoted as NSPc1-RNAi1, 2 and IMG800 (control), were also identified with the same methods. These above mentioned cell pools were then replated, expanded and maintained in complete media containing 300 &#x003bc;g/ml G418 as stable integrated cell pools.

To test whether NSPc1 has a similar role in tumor cell growth as Mel-18 and Bmi-1, we transiently over-expressed NSPc1 in HeLa (PcG members enriched cell line) and SH-SY5Y (endogenous NSPc1 expressed cell line) cells. Cell cycle distributions were determined by analysis of their total DNA content. The cells with 2n DNA were classified as G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1</sub> populations, those with 4n DNA were classified as G<sub>2</sub>/M populations, and those with DNA content 2n&#x02013;4n were assigned to be in the S phase of the cell cycle. Flow cytometric analysis showed an S phase increase and a G<sub>2</sub>/M phase decrease in both cell lines after transient NSPc1 over-expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1 a&#x02013;f</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>NSPc1 promotes tumor cell cycle progression and enhances cell proliferation</title><p>NSPc1 stably over-expressed and knocked-down HeLa cell pools were established to verify its effect on cell proliferation. The IMG800 plasmid, which contains the human U6 promoter and a neomycin resistance gene, was used to establish the NSPc1 stably knockdown HeLa cell pool. Several constructs that direct synthesis of NSPc1 siRNAs <italic>in vivo</italic> were designed as mentioned in materials and methods. The expression level of NSPc1 in the above HeLa cell pools were analyzed both at the mRNA and protein level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>).</p><p>Flow cytometric analysis demonstrated that the cell cycle distributions of the above mentioned stable HeLa cell pools showed the similar pattern as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2b and c</xref>). Stable over-expression of NSPc1 in HeLa cells caused S phase increase and G<sub>2</sub> phase decrease or G<sub>2</sub>/M transition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). While RNAi NSPc1 in HeLa cells led to the reverse effects, and it seemed that the &#x02018;RNAi1&#x02019; construct was more effective (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). Furthermore, the results from MTT assays demonstrated that the expression level of NSPc1 could also influence the proliferation rate of HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d and e</xref>). Since HeLa cell is a tumor cell line with colony formation ability in semi-solid culture medium, we addressed the question whether NSPc1 interferes with the colony formation ability of this tumor cell line. Considering that the siRNA synthesized from the &#x02018;RNAi1&#x02019; constructs seemed to be more effective in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>), we only chose the &#x02018;RNAi1&#x02019; and &#x02018;NSPc1&#x02019; stable cell pools to compare cell colony formation activity. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f and g</xref>, there was about an average of 25% decrease in colony number and a decrease in average colony size in the &#x02018;RNAi1&#x02019; pool compared to the &#x02018;NSPc1&#x02019; pool. All these results proved that NSPc1 not only promotes HeLa cell cycle progression, but enhances cell proliferation as well.</p></sec><sec><title>NSPc1 specifically represses the expression of CDK inhibitor p21</title><p>PcGs have been found to repress some negative cell cycle regulators to promote cell cycle transition and cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>). For example, the p16ARF/p19INK4a locus has been verified as the key target of PcG proteins Bmi-1 and Cbx-7, and the two CDKIs from this locus are partially responsible for the effect of Bmi-1 and Cbx-7 on cell growth regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>). Therefore, we speculated that NSPc1, as a typical PcG member, could also promote cell growth through repressing some negative cell cycle regulators, specially the CDK inhibitor family members. To find out the possible CDK inhibitors involved, the expression levels of the CDK inhibitors were assessed in our stable HeLa cell pools with semi-quantitative RT&#x02013;PCR. GAPDH and Bmi-1 were amplified as controls. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>, only the expression of p21 was repressed. Western blot results showed the similar expression pattern of p21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>NSPc1 represses p21 promoter activity in a dose dependent manner but independent of p53</title><p>To elucidate the molecular mechanisms of the repression of p21 by NSPc1, we examined the effect of over-expressed NSPc1 on the transcription activity of the p21 promoter by using dual luciferase report assay. Considering that the proximal 2.3 kb region of the p21 promoter has been well studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>), we mainly focused on this 2.3 kb region in the following repression activity assays. The plasmid pGL3Basic-2.3kb p21 promoter and its derivative plasmids, which were described by Liu <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>), were kindly represented by Dr Gallego C. and used in the current work. Meanwhile, c-Myc was included as a positive control since it represses the expression of the luciferase reporter gene driven by a p21 promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>, over-expression of NSPc1 in COS-7 cells led to a &#x0223c;45% decrease of relative luciferase activity compared with control, although over-expression of c-Myc led to a stronger repression (&#x0223c;60% decrease) on the p21 promoter. But over-expression of Bmi-1 could not repress the transcriptional activity of the p21 promoter at all, which eliminated the possibility that the inhibition by NSPc1 is an artifact. Co-transfection of NSPc1 with c-Myc has a slight synergistic transcriptional repression effect on the p21 promoter (&#x0223c;70% decrease, data not shown). Furthermore, we found that NSPc1 inhibited p21 promoter-mediated luciferase expression in a dose-dependent manner in COS-7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). Since COS-7 cells express abundant p53 proteins while HeLa cells lack functional p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>), the same dose-dependent assay was also performed in HeLa cells to see whether the p53 protein is involved in the repression by NSPc1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>). Results obtained from HeLa cells were consistent with those from COS-7 cells, which indicated the independence of p53 protein in NSPc1-mediated repression <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>p21 promoter repression by NSPc1 is dependent on the RA response element (RARE element)</title><p>In order to find out whether the NSPc1 protein is able to bind the p21 promoter <italic>in vivo</italic>, we performed ChIP assay in HeLa cells. A schematic map of the p21 promoter was drawn in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a and b</xref>, PCR product representing the region (&#x02212;1357 to &#x02212;1063) of p21 promoter was immunoprecipitated with both RXR&#x003b1; antibody (Santa Cruz) and NSPc1 antisera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>), while no band was visible using pre-immunized sera or IgG. In contrast, no PCR products were visible when using the primers for the downstream (&#x02212;194 to +84) or the upstream (&#x02212;2264 to &#x02212;1971) regions of p21 promoter. Real time ChIP done in various HeLa cell pools confirmed the specific binding of NSPc1 on the p21 promoter region (&#x02212;1357 to &#x02212;1063) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>).</p><p>To find out whether the effect of NSPc1 on p21 relies on some important <italic>cis</italic>-elements in the proximal p21 promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>), such as the RARE element within the (&#x02212;1357 to &#x02212;1063) region, several mutated constructs of the p21 promoter were used to detect the repression activity of NSPc1. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>, in COS-7 cells, NSPc1 can inhibit the activity of the 2.3 kb (wt, wild type), the 1.8 kb (with the pivotal p53 binding site deleted) and the 2.3 kb (with the proximal 1, 2 E-box mutated) fragments of the p21 promoter, but not the RARE-mutated fragment. A similar loss of function of NSPc1 on p21 RARE-mutated promoter was also observed in HeLa cells (data not shown). All of these results indicated that the RARE element within the p21 promoter region (&#x02212;1357 to &#x02212;1063) is crucial for NSPc1-mediated repression of p21 promoter activity, which also suggested that the RARE element is a potential functional binding site of the NSPc1 protein.</p></sec><sec><title>RXR&#x003b1; deprives the repression effect of NSPc1 on the p21 promoter through competing RARE element</title><p>RARE element is known as the binding site for RA receptors, such as RXR&#x003b1;, &#x003b2;, &#x003b3; and RAR&#x003b1;, &#x003b2;, &#x003b3; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>). To explore whether any type of RA receptors can interfere with NSPc1 repression on p21, we over-expressed RXR&#x003b1; with the reporter genes in COS-7 cells and observed an induction of the basal level of p21 promoter activity. When equal amounts of RXR&#x003b1; were co-expressed with NSPc1, RXR&#x003b1; markedly overcame the repression of NSPc1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>). Moreover, RXR&#x003b1; relieved the repression of NSPc1 on the p21 promoter in a dose dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>, left). Increasing amounts of NSPc1 (maximum to 2-fold of RXR&#x003b1;) could not resume the repressive effect on p21 once a certain amount of exogenous RXR&#x003b1; existed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>, right).</p><p>As RXR&#x003b1; is a native binding factor of RARE element, we speculated that the over-expressed RXR&#x003b1; occupies the RARE region and results in excluding NSPc1 from the p21 promoter. The following DNA pulldown assays sequentially verified not only the binding ability of NSPc1 dependent on the RARE element of p21 promoter, but the competitive binding relationship between NSPc1 and RXR&#x003b1; as well. A series of DNA pulldown assays were performed with different biotinylated DNA probes representing the regions (&#x02212;1357 to &#x02212;1063 and &#x02212;194 to +84) of the p21 promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). It is evident from the results that the probes of region (&#x02212;1357 to &#x02212;1063), but not of the region (&#x02212;194 to +84), could recruit both NSPc1-V5 and RXR&#x003b1;-V5 <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>). Here SP1-V5 and Bmi-1-V5 were included as the positive and negative controls. However, NSPc1-V5 did not bind the probes of region (&#x02212;1357 to &#x02212;1063) any more after RARE element was mutated, which suggested that NSPc1 binding the region (&#x02212;1357 to &#x02212;1063) of the p21 promoter is dependent on RARE element. Furthermore, their binding amounts on the RARE-contained region of the p21 promoter were positively correlated with the input amount of COS-7 extracts, which contain over-expressed NSPc1-V5 or RXR&#x003b1;-V5, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>). This let us to the hypothesis that RXR&#x003b1; can compete with NSPc1 for the RARE element <italic>in vivo</italic>. So further <italic>in vivo</italic> DNA pulldown assay used NSPc1-V5 over-expressed COS-7 extracts before or after retinoic acid induction as the input samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e</xref>). Up-regulated endogenous RA receptors including RXR&#x003b1; competed for the RARE binding sites of the p21 promoter probe (&#x02212;1357 to &#x02212;1063) with over-expressed NSPc1-V5. This result further confirmed the competition between NSPc1 and RXR&#x003b1; for the RARE element <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In the current study, we showed that NSPc1 increased the fraction of S phase cells and promoted the G<sub>2</sub>/M phase transition in HeLa and SH-SY5Y cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). These effects were then confirmed in stable HeLa cell pools (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b and c</xref>). Detection on the expression of most of CDKIs showed that the cell growth characteristics of the HeLa stable cell pools were related to the alteration of p21 expression both at the RNA and the protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d and g</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a and b</xref>). Since CDK inhibitor p21 negatively affects cell cycle progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>), the regulation of p21 would account for a possible molecular mechanism through which NSPc1 controls tumor cell cycle and cell proliferation. While the knockdown of NSPc1 is not sufficient to abrogate the colony formation ability of tumor cells although it decreases cell growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d and g</xref>). So further studies such as selective over-expression or knockout of NSPc1 in animal models are needed to prove the pathogenetic role of NSPc1 in tumorigenesis.</p><p>p21 was originally characterized as an important effector in p53-mediated cell cycle arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>). The expression of this gene was mainly regulated in the transcription level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>). Previous studies indicated that many transcription factors other than p53 also can regulate p21 during cell differentiation and growth arrest, such as c-Myc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>) and RA receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>). Here we firstly demonstrated that NSPc1 represses p21 transcription as c-Myc does but Bmi-1 has no effect on p21 transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a and b</xref>). It agrees with our previous view that the transcriptional repression process of NSPc1 may involve different mechanisms from Bmi-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>). We suppose here that NSPc1 is an important transcriptional regulator of p21, whereas Bmi-1 is a key upstream factor of the p16ARF/p19INK4a pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>). Moreover, we showed the independence of p53 protein activity in NSPc1-mediated repression of p21 <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5d</xref>), and the NSPc1-mediated repression has a crosstalking with the RA signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6a, b</xref>).</p><p>In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, polycomb proteins regulate gene expression by forming multiprotein complexes at specific chromosomal sites called polycomb response elements (PREs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>), but until now no exact &#x02018;mammalian PRE&#x02019; consensus sequence has been reported. It was difficult for us to decide exactly which promoter region of p21 should be used in the ChIP experiments. However, recent studies showed that the mammalian polycomb protein Bmi-1 can bind to a certain site (around the transcription start site) in the proximal promoter region of its target gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>). So in the NSPc1-ChIP assays, three representative promoter regions were selected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a and b</xref>). The selected proximal region (&#x02212;194 to +84) of the p21 promoter represents the core promoter region, which includes the TATA box, the SP1/SP3 binding sites, the E-boxes and the transcription start site. We observed that the repression of p21 by NSPc1 does not involve disturbing the basal transcription machine, for there was no positive signal from this core promoter region in the ChIP assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). The second selected distal region (&#x02212;2264 to &#x02212;1971), which dose not contain any typical binding site, represents a random or non-specific region of the p21 promoter. The third selected region (&#x02212;1357 to &#x02212;1063) includes a typical RA response element, based on the reports from Djabali's lab that the polycomb group protein M33 is able to control the accessibility of the RA response elements in the vicinity of the Hox genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>). In our ChIP assay, a positive signal was obtained from the region (&#x02212;1357 to &#x02212;1063) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>) and it was confirmed by using real-time ChIP in our stable HeLa cell pools (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). This indicated that a native NSPc1 protein complex is formed in the vicinity of the RARE region <italic>in vivo</italic>. Further mutational analysis of the p21 promoter revealed that the RARE sequence, which is capable of forming a complex with RA receptors, was critical for the repression function of NSPc1, but neither the p53 binding site nor the p53 protein was needed for the repression by NSPc1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>). Thus, a relationship between the polycomb group protein NSPc1 and the RA signaling pathway was revealed: the RXR&#x003b1; antagonizes the repression of NSPc1 on the p21 promoter, while NSPc1 does not affect exogenous RXR&#x003b1; targeting of RARE element (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a and b</xref>). Furthermore, DNA pulldown assays sequentially verified the binding ability of NSPc1 dependent on the RARE element of the p21 promoter and a competitive binding relationship between NSPc1 and RXR&#x003b1; both <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c and d</xref>) and <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e</xref>). These outcomes raise some interesting issues with respect to the roles of both polycomb members and the RA regulatory mechanisms. We propose that once the excessive RAR/RXR(s) dimer (s) occupy the RA response element in the p21 promoter, NSPc1 can no longer target and repress p21 as usual. Thus the RARE region may serve as a switch of p21 expression, which is controlled by the balance of polycomb repressions and the RA signaling pathways.</p><p>However, there are still some pivotal questions to be answered: for example, whether NSPc1 can directly bind to the RARE region? Although Mel-18 (a mammalian <italic>Psc</italic> homologue) has been demonstrated to bind DNA <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>), most polycomb proteins cannot bind to DNA directly. <italic>In vitro</italic> EMSA assay showed that recombinant NSPc1 protein alone could not bind to the RARE region of the p21 promoter (data not shown), which indicated other factors are needed for targeting. So which protein recruits NSPc1 to the RARE region in the p21 promoter remains an intriguing and unresolved question. We speculate that some unknown co-binding factors (CoB) may form complexes with NSPc1 <italic>in vivo</italic> and facilitate NSPc1 to recognize and target the RARE element (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a and b</xref>). It could be very interesting to identify the NSPc1 involved protein complex that binds the RARE element.</p><p>Taken together, current data support the hypothesis that NSPc1 has a positive role in promoting tumor cell cycle transition and cell proliferation, at least partially through down regulating the CDK inhibitor p21 via the RARE element. Furthermore, our results not only give a possible working model for the &#x02018;mammalian PREs&#x02019;, but connect transcriptional repression by mammalian PcGs with p21 and the RA signaling pathways as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c</xref>).</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Dr Carme Gallego for giving the p21 promoter constructs and Dr Aniko Paul for kindly revising the manuscript.
