Using knockdown and dominant negative approaches, we show that the microtubule-associated Ste20-like kinase SLK is required for focal adhesion turnover and cell migration downstream of the FAK/c-src complex. Our results show that SLK co-localizes with paxillin, Rac1 and the microtubules at the leading edge of migrating cells and is activated by scratch wounding. SLK activation is dependent on FAK/c-src/MAPK signaling, whereas SLK recruitment to the leading edge is src-dependent but FAK independent.

Here we show that SLK co-localizes with microtubules and adhesion components at the leading edge of migrating cells. We demonstrate that SLK is activated following scratch wounding of fibroblast monolayers in a FAK-src-MAPK-dependent manner. We find that SLK knockdown or expression of a dominant negative version results in impaired microtubule-dependent adhesion turnover and delayed migration.

Extended time courses up to 120 minutes have shown that SLK activity does not return to basal levels observed at time 0 (not shown).

However, in cultures where SLK has been efficiently knocked down, adhesion turnover is severely impaired as evidenced by the sustained levels of pY397-FAK. Similarly, a marked delay in pY397-FAK reduction (15 min vs 60 min) was observed in cultures expressing the DN SLK1-373<sup>K63R</sup> following nocodazole wash-out. As revealed by pY397-FAK and tubulin immunostaining, nocodazole treated cultures displayed large focal adhesions that disassembled as the microtubule repolymerized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001868-g004">figure 4C</xref>; t&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;15 min). However, cells expressing a SLK shRNA still displayed enlarged adhesion after the wash-out, suggesting impaired turnover. Interestingly, SLK kinase assays for the same time course showed that its activity was low in cells with large adhesions or high levels of pY397-FAK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001868-g004">figure 4D</xref>). Following nocodazole wash out, SLK kinase activity was upregulated within 15 minutes, as focal adhesions disassembled and was upregulated further at t&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;60 min, correlating with reduced levels of pY397-FAK. Longer time courses, up to 120 minutes, showed no further change in SLK activity, perhaps due to the fact that adhesion turnover has reached a steady state level. Supporting these observations, siRNA-mediated knock-down of SLK in migrating monolayers (2 hours post-wounding) resulted in an increase in the density and size of vinculin-positive adhesions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001868-g005">figure 5A&#x02013;D</xref>), suggesting that the absence of SLK may result in adhesion stabilization.
