We have previously reported that insulin-like growth factor &#x02013; I (IGF-I) promotes the phytohaemagglutinin (PHA)-induced CB T cell maturation and inhibits their apoptosis in mononuclear cell (MC) culture.

We further demonstrated that the neutralisation of IL-6 in CBMC culture partially abrogated the anti-apoptotic effect of IGF-1 on T cells.

It has been hypothesised that the functional immaturity of neonates may be the results of a number of factors, including the immaturity of the cellular component, the lack of previous exposure to antigens, and the uniqueness of the cytokine environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. There is increasing evidence that the survival of lymphocytes during sepsis may improve the disease outcome of the host [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Therefore, cytokines with the potential to promote the activation of T cells and their survival may have great clinical application.</p><p>Insulin-like growth factor &#x02013; I (IGF-I), which is known to be the mediator for many growth promoting effects of growth hormone, has also shown to have a direct influence on the maintenance of normal immune function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. It is a lymphopoietic cytokine which has profound stimulatory effects on lymphopoiesis <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Our previous study on cord blood mononuclear cell (CBMC) culture demonstrated that IGF-I has important immunobiological effects on proliferation, IL-6 and IFN-&#x003b3; production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and increase in telomerase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. IGF-1 also promotes maturation and inhibits the spontaneous and PHA-induced apoptosis of CB T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. It reduces the expression of Fas and protects T cells from Fas ligand induced apoptosis in CBMC culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. These previous studies were based on a mixed population of cells, in which the direct effect of IGF-1 on T cell and the roles of non-T cells have not been investigated. The objective of the current study is to delineate the effect of IGF-I in purified CD3+ T cell culture and to determine the roles of accessory cells and soluble factors in mediating the effects of IGF-I.</p><p>CD45, the leukocyte-common antigen, is a family of transmembrane glycoprotein with tyrosine phosphatase activity. Various isoforms are formed by the alternative splicing of three consecutive NH2-terminal exons of the CD45 transcript and are expressed differentially on haemopoietic cells. The expression of different isoforms is highly regulated but the detailed mechanisms are still unknown[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. CD45RA and CD45RO are two well-studied isoforms detected on na&#x000ef;ve/resting and memory/activated T lymphocytes respectively. Neonates are immunologically naive with little exposure to microorganisms and foreign antigens. Therefore, most neonatal T cells are naive and express CD45RA, whereas both naive CD45RA+ and mature CD45RO+ T cells are of approximately equal numbers in adult peripheral blood mononuclear cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Upon the exposure of appropriate <italic>in vitro </italic>stimulation, CD45RA+ cells can acquire phenotypic and functional characteristics of CD45RO+ cells, in particular the helper cell function and cytokine production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The expression of CD45RA and CD45RO are, however, not mutually exclusive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] and interconversion of the CD45 isoform <italic>in vivo </italic>has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. It has been suggested that the dual positive CD45RA+CD45RO+ cells represent a population of transitional cells which contain primed T cells, which in the absence of antigenic stimulation may re-aquire a na&#x000ef;ve phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>It has been recognised previously that accessory cells, in particular monocytes, play a crucial role in the regulation of T lymphocyte differentiation and activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Monocytes express antigen presenting and co-stimulatory molecules (such as MHC Class II molecules, CD1, CD40, CD80 and CD86) and release cytokines (such as TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-1 and IL-6) that act on T lymphocytes. We therefore extended our experiments to study the role of monocytes and IL-6 in the maturation of CB T cells in order to determine the underlying mechanisms mediating the effect of IGF-I.</p><p>IL-6 has been reported to be an anti-apoptotic cytokine which can prevent T cells apoptosis. However, the reports are restricted to murine studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Since IGF-I have also been reported to stimulate the release of cytokines from monocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] and CBMC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], we further investigated if IL-6 has a direct anti-apoptotic effect on purified CD3+ T cells. To confirm the role played by IL-6 in our previous reports, we neutralised IL-6 in CBMC culture by monoclonal antibodies. The possible anti-apoptotic mechanism involving the expression of Fas on different subsets of T cells was also investigated. This is the first report which provide evidences that monocytes play a role in mediating the maturation effect of IGF-I, whereas the anti-apoptotic effect of IGF-I may be mediated through the release of IL-6 from accessory cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell Preparation</title><p>Human umbilical cord blood samples were collected from the placentae of normal full-term uncomplicated pregnancy.

In this study, we further investigated the effect of IGF-I on CD4+ and CD8+ subsets. In CBMC culture, the majority of T cells in CBMC are na&#x000ef;ve cells (CD4+CD45RA+CD45RO-: 78.1 &#x000b1; 1.0%; CD8+CD45RA+CD45RO-: 89.1 &#x000b1; 1.9%; n = 8).

There was a complementary increase in the CD4+CD45RA+CD45RO+ dual positive population which reached a maximum level of about 40% on Day 3 and declined to about 20% on Day 6. The proportion of mature memory cells (CD4+CD45RA-CD45RO+) remained at about 10% for the first 3 days of activation before increasing to about 30% by Day 6, and then maintained at that level until Day 9.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>The kinetics of CD45 isoform changes for CD4+ T helper cells and CD8+ cytotoxic T cells in (a) CBMC culture; and, (b) purified CD3+ T cell culture.</bold> CBMC (a) or CD3+ T cells (b) were incubated for different period with PHA (1 &#x003bc;g/ml ----&#x025cb;----) alone or PHA + IGF-I (100 ng/ml &#x02014;&#x025cf;&#x02014;). CD45 isoform expression was determined by three-colour flow cytometry. The kinetics of transition from na&#x000ef;ve to mature/memory phenotype in CD4+ and CD8+ cells were similar. In CBMC, IGF-I promoted the PHA-induced maturation of CD45 isoforms. In CD3+ T cells, the maturation process was delayed and IGF-I only slightly promoted the PHA-induced maturation of CD45 isoforms.

The CD8+CD45RA+CD45RO+ double-positive cells was highest on Day 3 (~30%), and then maintained at rather low level of ~10% from Day 6 to Day 9.

The effects of IGF-I on CD4+ and CD8+ cells in CBMC cultures were similar.

Probably as a result of antigen exposure, there is an age-related decrease in "virgin, non-antigen primed, na&#x000ef;ve CD45RA+ T cells" and increase in "mature, activated, memory CD45RO+ T cells" [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. The expression of CD45 isoforms is also regulated by mitogenic and antigenic activation. When stimulated with mitogens such as PHA or Con A <italic>in vitro</italic>, CD45RA+ T cells lose CD45RA expression and gain CD45RO expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Cytokines that can promote the maturation of T cells would have a high potential for clinical application in the management of infection in neonates.</p><p>IGF-I has been reported to have profound positive effects on immune function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and most recently IGF-I has shown to increase survival in a murine sepsis model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. We have previously reported the positive effects of IGF-I on PHA-stimulated CBMC in terms of cytokine production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], and survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In this study, we further demonstrated that IGF-I can significantly promote the PHA-induced cord blood T helper cell and cytotoxic T cell maturation in CBMC but less efficiently in the purified CD3+ T cell culture in which accessory cells are absent (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p><p>Similar to a previous report on CD45 isoform conversion of CB CD4+ cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], our results demonstrated rapid decrease of CD45RA+CD45RO- cells with reciprocal increase in CD45RA-CD45RO+ cells in both the CD4+ and CD8+ subsets when CBMC or purified CD3+ cells were stimulated by PHA with or without IGF-I. As supported by the kinetics of expression, especially the presence of the transitional dual positive cells, the observed decline in na&#x000ef;ve cells and corresponding increase in mature cells represent the conversion of CD45 isoforms rather than the preferential expansion/survival of mature cells or the selective elimination of na&#x000ef;ve cells.</p><p>The PHA-induced <italic>in vitro </italic>CB T cells maturation was delayed in the absence of accessory cells. This delay in maturation might have led to delayed expression of IGF-I receptors, and hence, IGF-I only slightly promoted T cell maturation. Previous studies on the expression of IGF-I receptors on activated T cells were limited to adult cells and the results have been controversial. Using iodopeptide comparative binding studies, an increase in IGF-I receptors expression on activated T cells has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Different IGF-I receptor expression on activated T cells (CD4+CD45RA+ &#x0003e; CD8+CD45RA+ &#x0003e; CD8+CD45RO+ &#x0003e; CD4+CD45RO+) has also been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. On the contrary, Schillaci et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] reported a rapid decline in IGF-I receptors on both CD4+ and CD8+ cells after activation. Further experiments are therefore needed to determine if the effect of IGF-I in promoting the change in CD45RA to CD45RO isoforms in neonatal cells is due to differential expression of IGF-I receptors in these subpopulations.</p><p>Due to the limitation of two colour flow cytometry or the combination of antibodies in the past, some reports have considered the expression of CD45RA and CD45RO to be mutually exclusive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Only few reports have reported the presence of dual positive CD45RA+CD45RO+ in adult peripheral blood. These cells were proposed to be representing activated lymphocytes after viral infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>] or primed transitional cells with characteristic antigenic and cytokine expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. In a study on neonates with documented sepsis, up regulation of CD45RA+RO+ cells on CD4+ cells was detected early in the infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. In our study, we have consistently detected a CD45RA+CD45RO+ population in the activated culture. The different kinetics of dual positive cells in CBMC and purified T cell culture suggested that some factors which promote a rapid but transient increase of dual positive cells in Day 3 CBMC was missing in purified T cell culture (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). This hypothesis was subsequently confirmed by the co-culture experiments, in which the addition of monocytes to T cells at 1:4 ratio restored the kinetics of dual positive T cells (data not shown). Further research on the cellular function of dual positive cells and the molecules regulating T cell maturation is important because these cells may be potential candidates for ex vivo expansion of T cells for autologous immunotherapy. The possibility of interconversion of CD45RA+ and CD45RO+ cells also deserves further investigation which may have implication in the strategy of limiting GvHD in haemopoietic stem cell transplant.</p><p>In previous study of T cell proliferation, it has been suggested that complete activation of T cells requires at least two signals: (1) by antigen-specific T cell receptor; and, (2) by antigen presenting cells and/or cytokines produced by antigen presenting cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Some reports also emphasised on an absolute requirement of accessory cells for T cell proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. The ability of different subpopulations of adult blood mononuclear cells to serve as accessory cells has been studied previously. Halvorsen <italic>et al </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>] have reported that the removal of monocytes decreased the ability of non T cells to serve as accessory cells for both CD4+ and CD8+ cells stimulated by PHA. The need of monocyte to T cell contact has also been established by separating the cells by a semi-permeable membrane which allows the diffusion of macromolecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. Novel pathway of monocyte dependent regulation of T cells has been reported and the relationship between monocytes and T cells is complicated because the molecules expressed on monocytes can be stimulatory, such as CD1a [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>], or inhibitory, such as CD98 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. In this study, purified autologous CD14+ monocytes added to purifed CD3+ T cells promoted the PHA-induced T cell maturation and further increased the percentage of CD45RA-CD45RO+ cells in Day 6 culture. The addition of monocytes to PHA-stimulated CD3+ cells in the presence of IGF-I, significantly increased the percentage of CD45RA-CD45RO+ cells. We, therefore, suggest that IGF-I acts on monocytes which in turn promotes the PHA-induced CD45 isoform conversion in CB T cells.</p><p>The ratio of monocyte to T cells in the co-culture may also affect the PHA- induced CD45 isoform conversion. In this study, we have mixed the cells at monocyte to T cell ratio of 1:4 based on the ratio observed in freshly isolated CBMC. In other studies, the addition of only 2&#x02013;4% mitomycin C treated plastic adherent CD14+ monocytes was shown to be effective in inducing activation of T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. On the other hand, Wesch et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>] have reported significant cell death in a 1:1 co-culture of T cells and monocytes in the presence of PMA or PHA. The CD4+ and CD8+ subsets were equally susceptible to the monocyte dependent cell death (MDCD) but the effect of different mitogens is regulated by different mechanisms. We have not studied the effect of monocytes on T cell death but the observation under light microscopy and the scatter characteristics determined by flow cytometry did not show obvious difference in cultures with and without monocytes.</p><p>The relationship between cytokine production and cellular activation in the co-culture system is multidirectional. When stimulated, cord blood cells can produce IL-6, IL-2, IFN-&#x003b3;, TNF-a and IL-10 but little IL-4 and IL-5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. Freshly purified CD4+CD45RA+ cells, however, did not produce IL-2, IL-4 and IFN-&#x003b3; upon primary stimulation (PHA or anti-CD2) but secrete IL-2 and IFN-&#x003b3; after secondary stimulation by accessory cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. IFN-&#x003b3; can in turn stimulate HLA-DR expression on monocytes further enhancing their accessory function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. It is therefore important to study the cytokines released in the co-culture of monocytes and T cells in our system for the identification of potential candidates responsible for the observed induction in T cell maturation.</p><p>It has been reported that IGF-I stimulates the release of cytokine from monocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] and it has been shown to stimulate the release of significantly increased amounts of IL-6 in PHA-induced CBMC culture in our previous report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. IL-6 is produced by a variety of haemopoietic cells and the cross-linking of Fc receptors on monocytes and triggers IL-6 production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>]. IL-6 provides accessory signals for T cell activation, and antisera to IL-6 completely neutralised the helper effect of monocyte supernatant for PHA-induced human T cell activation and proliferation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B59">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>]. In this study, IGF-I only stimulated a very low level of IL-6 in the purified CD3+ T cells suggesting that the major source of IL-6 in CBMC culture is from non-T cells. Interestingly, the addition of IL-6 (in the range of 1 &#x02013; 50 ng/mL) did not alter the kinetics nor the extent of PHA-induced CB T cell maturation. This is suggestive that CB T cell maturation may require the presence of other cytokines and/or cell-cell interaction. Future experiments using transwell to separate the T cells and monocytes in the co-culture can determine if the effect of monocyte is contact dependent.</p><p>Activation of T cells by PHA leads to a series of events including maturation, proliferation and activation induced apoptosis. We have previously reported the anti-apoptotic effect of IGF-I and demonstrated the downregulation of Fas expression on PHA-induced T cells in CBMC. In the purified CB CD3+ T cells culture, the anti-apoptotic effect of IGF-1 is weaker than that observed in the CBMC culture. It is evident that factors that are present in CBMC culture but absent in the purified T cell culture are responsible in mediating the anti-apoptotic effect of IGF-1. We showed that IL-6, a factor that is upregulated by IGF-1 in CBMC culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], strongly inhibited PHA-induced apoptosis in purified T cell culture (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). The concentration of IL-6 used (10 ng/mL) is comparable to the maximum concentration assayed in the CBMC culture (~5 ng/mL).</p><p>The anti-apoptotic role played by IL-6 was further confirmed by the neutralising experiments. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>, the neutralisation of IL-6 in the PHA + IGF-I CBMC culture significantly increased the percentage of apoptotic cells. Since the anti-apoptotic effect of IGF-I was not completely neutralised by anti-IL-6 antibodies, the result suggested that other cellular or molecular factors in the mixed CBMC culture may be mediating the effects of IGF-I. The addition of other neutralising antibodies may allow us to identify these factors.</p><p>It has been reported that IL-6 prevents the TCR/CD3 activation induced cell death by decreasing the expression of Fas and FasL expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>]. We, therefore, determined whether the anti-apoptotic effect of IL-6 is mediated through the downregulation of Fas expression in the CD3+ T cell culture. To our surprise, IL-6 slightly upregulated Fas expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>) but the induction did not reach statistical significance. This result suggested that (1) the anti-apoptotic effect of IL-6 in purified CD3+ T cell culture is not Fas dependent, and (2) cell-cell interaction and other cytokines upregulated by IGF-1 may be responsible for the down regulation of CD95 (Fas) previously observed in the CBMC culture. In addition, IL-6 has also been reported to protect cells from apoptosis via the bcl-2/p53 pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>]. Therefore other intracellular signalling pathway and the expression of IL-6 receptor on CB T cell subsets also worth further investigation.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this study, we have described the role of accessory cells and IL-6 in mediating the effect of IGF-I on PHA-induced CB T cells maturation and apoptosis. Knowledge on the mechanism by which monocytes play their accessory role may be used to develop new protocols for therapeutic manipulation of cells. With the high frequency of neonatal sepsis and increased use of CB for haemopoietic reconstitution, a better understanding of CB T cell physiology and the potential of some cytokines in promoting the survival and activation of T cells will help to lower the mortality caused by infection in infants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>].
