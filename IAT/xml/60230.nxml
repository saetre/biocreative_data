PAX6 is expressed in the eye, central nervous system and pancreas. Two alternative promoters, P0 and P1, which are differentially regulated during development, drive <italic>PAX6</italic> transcription. We identified a 57 bp <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory element in exon 1 of the human <italic>PAX6</italic> gene exon 1 enhancer (EIE). EIE enhances P1-driven <italic>PAX6</italic> expression. Three regions in E1E (E1E-1, E1E-2 and E1E-3) have sequence similarities with binding sites of transcription factors ARP-1, Isl-1 and SEF, respectively. As shown by electrophoretic mobility shift assays, E1E-3, but not E1E-1 or E1E-2, bound to proteins in nuclear extracts of human glioma cells and transcription factor SEF bound to E1E-3. As shown by transient transfection experiments, deletion or site-specific mutations in E1E-3 dramatically decreased P1 promoter activity. Mutations in E1E-2, however, did not affect function of the P1 promoter. Co-transfection of SEF and <italic>PAX6</italic> promoter&#x02013;reporter constructs showed that SEF up-regulates <italic>PAX6</italic> gene expression through the P1 promoter. Two Sp1 sites in the E1E region were also shown to be important by transient co-transfection assays.

Its expression is limited to the eye, central nervous system and pancreas. PAX6 is highly conserved throughout the animal kingdom and in man and mouse the PAX6 protein is identical. The level of PAX6 protein is critical since mutations that reduce PAX6 levels result in eye phenotypes of variable severity. A reduction in PAX6 level is caused by mutations in the <italic>PAX6</italic> gene and putative regultory regions controling <italic>PAX6</italic> gene expression.</p><p><italic> PAX6</italic> transcription is controlled by two promoters, P0 and P1. In the mouse, P0-initiated transcripts predominate in the lens placode, cornea and conjuntival epithelia and in the developing pancreas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke490c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke490c2">2</xref>). P1-initiated transcripts are expressed in lens placode, optic vesicle and central nervous system. The P0 promoter and several <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements have been well characterized in human, mouse, quail and pufferfish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke490c1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke490c4">4</xref>).</p><p> Since little is known about the molecular mechanisms that control expression of the <italic>PAX6</italic> gene, it is important to understand the regulation of <italic>PAX6</italic> through <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements (enhancers or silencers). It is known that <italic>PAX6</italic>, as a tissue-specific regulatory gene, is transcribed from two alternative promoters (P0 and P1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke490c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke490c4">4</xref>) that are differentially regulated in human brain development and in adult brain plasticity. Some distinct <italic>cis</italic> elements are involved in regulating the P0 and P1 promoters and in tissue-specific expression of <italic>PAX6</italic> in the eye, the central nervous system and pancreas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke490c5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke490c7">7</xref>) and several potential binding sites for transcription factors lie within the P0 and P1 promoters. The P0 promoter contains a TATA-like box, a CCAAT box, multiple consensus transcription factor binding sites for AP1, AP2, Sp1, c-Myb and Pit-1 and sites for the p53 transcriptional activator, NF&#x003ba;B and C&#x0002f;EBP protein. The P1 promoter contains a TATA-like box, two CCAAT boxes, a 38 bp polymorphic dinucleotide repeat sequence, (AC)<sub>m</sub>(AG)<sub>n</sub>, and potential transcription factor binding sites for AP1, AP2, AP4, Sp1, c-Myb, Pit-1, ARP-1, and Isl-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke490c8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke490c9">9</xref>; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke490f1">1</xref>). Another region between &#x02013;3.1 and &#x02013;2.9 kb upstream of the P1 promoter contains a regulatory element that directs <italic>PAX6</italic> expression in the developing photoreceptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke490c10">10</xref>). Other putative <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements involved in human <italic>PAX6</italic> expression have been proposed to lie upstream or downstream of the <italic>PAX6</italic> transcription initiation site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke490c10">10</xref>). In this paper we report our search for such elements and our identification of a novel enhancer element in exon 1 of the human <italic>PAX6</italic> gene, the exon 1 enhancer (EIE), which is activated by transcription factors SAA3 enhancer factor (SEF) and Sp1. We also demonstrate a physical association between SEF and Sp1 in regulating <italic>PAX6</italic> gene expression.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>Human glioma cell lines U251 and LN229 were derived from two different glioblastomas and both have mutations in the <italic>p53</italic> gene.

In brief, two partially overlapping primers, designated R and F, which contained mutations, were synthesized for each mutant construct (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gke490tb2">2</xref>). Using PCR, two DNA fragments were amplified from 346pGL3B plasmid DNA in two separate reactions. The first reaction (first round PCR) contained primers R and RVP3, corresponding to the vector sequence upstream of the insert, or primers F and GLP2, corresponding to the vector sequence downstream of the insert. The two PCR products of the expected sizes were isolated from the first round PCR mixtures by electrophoresis on a 2&#x00025; agarose gel and were cut out, mixed together and resuspended in 400&#x02013;500 &#x000b5;l of water by heating for 5 min at 95&#x000b0;C.

Sequence analyses of E1E revealed several potential regulatory factor binding sites, including an E1E-1 site (CAGAGGTCA), an E1E-2 site (CTAATG), an E1E-3 site (CCAGTGAGGAGCGG) and four Sp1 sites (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke490f1">1</xref>). The sequences of the E1E-1, E1E-2 and E1E-3 binding regions are similar to the binding sequence of the transcription factor apolipoprotein AI regulatory protein-1 (ARP-1), Islet-1 (Isl-1) and <italic>Drosophila</italic> serendipity-&#x003b2; (D-Sry-&#x003b2;), respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Characterization of the <italic>PAX6</italic> P1 promoter enhancer E1E by EMSA</title><p>To characterize the specificity of the DNA&#x02013;protein binding affinity of each potential transcription factor binding site in E1E, double-stranded oligonucleotides corresponding to each binding site were synthesized and end-labeled with <sup>32</sup>P for use as probes. Nuclear extracts were prepared from U251 cells. As shown by EMSA, no DNA&#x02013;protein complexes formed with the E1E-1 oligonucleotide (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke490f2">2</xref>, lane 1) and a weak complex was formed with the E1E-2 oligonucleotide (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke490f2">2</xref>, lane 2). In contrast, a strong complex was formed with the E1E-3 oligonucleotide and nuclear extracts from U251 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke490f2">2</xref>, lane 4), indicating the presence of proteins binding both the E1E-2 and E1E-3 regions in <italic>PAX6</italic> exon 1.</p><p> To determine whether the 6 bp E1E-2 and the 14 bp E1E-3 sequences were critical for the formation of DNA&#x02013;protein complexes, mutant E1E-2 and E1E-3 oligonucleotides (mE1E-2 and mE1E3, respectively) were synthesized (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gke490tb1">1</xref>) and used as probes in EMSA. In contrast to the wild-type oligonucleotide, mE1E-2 did not form DNA&#x02013;protein complexes with proteins in the nuclear extracts (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke490f2">2</xref>, lane 3). Since the sequence of E1E-2 is similar to that of the binding site of transcription factor Isl-1, Isl-1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) was added to the EMSA reaction to determine if the E1E-2 binding protein was Isl-1. Surprisingly, no supershift or decrease in the amount of DNA&#x02013;protein complexes was demonstrated (data not shown), indicating that the protein in the E1E-2 complex was not Isl-1. Gel shift competition experiments were used to examine nuclear protein binding to E1E-3. The E1E-3 probe bound well with nuclear proteins (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke490f2">2</xref>, lane 4) and excess unlabeled oligonucleotide effectively competed labeled oligonucleotide binding (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke490f3">3</xref>A, lane 2). Mutation of the three central nucleotides in E1E-3 (m1E1E-3) reduced binding (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke490f2">2</xref>, lane 5). Mutation of three nucleotides on either side of the E1E-3 binding site completely abolished binding (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke490f2">2</xref>, lanes 6 and 7). Thus, proteins in the glioma cell nuclear extract bind to both the E1E-2 and E1E-3 regions in a sequence-specific manner and the nucleotides adjacent to the E1E-3 region appear to be more critical for binding than those in the middle. Comparison of the E1E-3 region (5&#x02032;-CCAGTGAGGAGCGGT-3&#x02032;) with the consensus binding site 5&#x02032;-CNRGN<sub>5&#x02013;6</sub>CNRG-3&#x02032; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke490c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke490c16">16</xref>) showed matches at 13 of 14 positions.</p></sec><sec><title>SEF binding to E1E-3</title><p>Because of the high sequence similarity of the EIE-3 and SEF binding sequences, we investigated whether SEF could be the transcription factor that binds the E1E-3 site. SEF is a transcription factor encoding the human serum amyloid A3 (<italic>SAA3</italic>) gene enhancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke490c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke490c15">15</xref>). SEF has also been called LBP-1c&#x0002f;CP2&#x0002f;LSF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke490c17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke490c19">19</xref>). To determine whether SEF binds to the E1E-3 region in <italic>PAX6</italic>, the oligonucleotides corresponding to E1E-3 and the binding site of SEF in the <italic>SAA3</italic> promoter were labeled and used as probes in EMSA with nuclear extracts from LN229 human cells. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke490f3">3</xref>A, the binding activity of E1E-3 oligonucleotide was competed by itself (lane 2) and by wild-type SEFB (lane 4), but not by the mutant forms of each oligonucleotide (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke490f3">3</xref>A, lanes 3 and 5). The binding activity of SEF was competed by itself and by wild-type E1E-3, but not by the mutant forms of each oligonucleotide (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke490f3">3</xref>A, lanes 8 and 10). These results indicate that SEF protein binds to the E1E-3 region. To determine if SEF binds to the E1E-3 region, supershift experiments were performed with anti-SEF antibody and preimmune rabbit serum as a control (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke490f3">3</xref>B). Both SEF and E1E-3 DNA&#x02013;protein complexes were supershifted by anti-SEF antibody (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke490f3">3</xref>B, lanes 3&#x02013;5 and 8&#x02013;10). Thus, the protein complexes formed with E1E-3 and the SEF probe involved the same SEF protein. The conclusion that SEF protein binds to the E1E-3 binding region of the <italic>PAX6</italic> P1 promoter was confirmed by EMSA using SEF protein synthesized <italic>in vitro</italic>. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke490f4">4</xref>, both EIE-3 and SEF oligonucleotides bind to SEF protein and form protein&#x02013;DNA complexes (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke490f4">4</xref>, lanes 1 and 11). The binding activities of both EIE-3 and the SEF probe are competed by themselves but not by their mutant forms (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke490f4">4</xref>, lanes 2&#x02013;6 and 7&#x02013;10). In order to confirm that the SEF protein synthesized <italic>in vitro</italic> was the oligonucleotide binding component, SEF protein was mixed with SEF antibody before addition of labeled EIE-3 or SEF oligonucleotide and complex formation was assayed by EMSA. In the absence of SEF antibody appropriate complexes were formed. Increasing amounts of SEF antibody reduced the amount of SEF protein driven into protein&#x02013;DNA complexes with the oligonucleotide probe (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke490f4">4</xref>, lanes 13&#x02013;16 and 18&#x02013;20). These results indicate that SEF protein binds to the EIE-3 region of the <italic>PAX6</italic> promoter.</p></sec><sec><title>Functional analysis of the putative transcription factor binding sites in E1E</title><p>The function of the three putative transcription factor binding sites in the exon 1 region of <italic>PAX6</italic> (E1E-1, E1E-2 and E1E-3) and the Sp1 binding site (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke490f1">1</xref>) were examined. Constructs with mutations in the binding sites were generated by PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis of 346pGL3B (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gke490tb2">2</xref>). The mutations were the same as those in the mutated oligonucleotides shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gke490tb1">1</xref>. The luciferase constructs were examined for promoter activity by transient transfection into U251 and LN229 cells. For comparison, the cells were also transfected with the luciferase construct without the promoter and enhancer (pGL3B). The structures of the mutant constructs and their promoter activities determined by transient expression assays are shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke490f5">5</xref>. For comparison, the luciferase activities were normalized to the activity of 346pGL3B.</p><p> Although the E1E-1 region did not bind to nuclear extracts of human glioblastoma cell lines (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke490f2">2</xref>), mutations in this region resulted in a 70&#x02013;90&#x00025; reduction in transactivation. However, a search of the database of transcription factor binding sites indicated that an Sp1 binding site overlaps the E1E-1 region (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke490f1">1</xref>). Thus, this decrease in promoter activity may have been caused by a mutation in the Sp1 site rather than in E1E-1, and it is possible that this Sp1 binding site is important in <italic>PAX6</italic> promoter function.</p><p> Mutation in the E1E-2 region (the same mutation that abolished binding shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke490f2">2</xref>) did not substantially affect promoter activity, suggesting that the E1E-2 region is not necessary in <italic>PAX6</italic> P1 promoter function. Two mutations in E1E-3 abolished binding activity and resulted in a 70&#x02013;90&#x00025; reduction in promoter activity. Deletion of the Sp1 binding region in E1E led to an 80&#x02013;95&#x00025; reduction in promoter activity. Together, these data suggest that the E1E-3 binding site in <italic>PAX6</italic> and the adjacent Sp1 binding site are both important for <italic>PAX6</italic> P1 promoter activity.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>In vitro</italic> interaction between SEF and Sp1</title><p>Sp1 is a ubiquitous transcription factor whose binding site, a GC box, is widely distributed in promoter regions of many genes. Because the SEF binding site (E1E-3) in E1E is adjacent to Sp1 binding sites, we hypothesized that the two transcription factors SEF and Sp1 may cooperate in the regulation of <italic>PAX6</italic> gene expression. LN229 nuclear extracts and SEF and Sp1 protein mixtures were immunoprecipitated with polyclonal anti-SEF antibody in separate experiments. Then the proteins in immunocomplexes were detected with anti-Sp1 antibody. As a positive control, immunoprecipitation by Sp1 antibody was done (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke490f6">6</xref>, lanes 3, 9 and 11). Negative controls showed that the Sp1 antibody was unable to detect <italic>in vitro</italic> synthesized SEF protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke490f6">6</xref>, lanes 7 and 12) and ruled out a cross-reaction between Sp1 antibody and SEF protein. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke490f6">6</xref>, Sp1 protein was detected in the SEF immunocomplexes from nuclear extracts and from the mixture of <italic>in vitro</italic> synthesized SEF and Sp1 proteins (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke490f6">6</xref>, lanes 2 and 6). In contrast, an unrelated antibody (anti-PAX6 antibody) failed to precipitate Sp1 protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke490f6">6</xref>, lane 4). These results indicate that SEF can interact directly with Sp1 <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Involvement of SEF and Sp1 in <italic>PAX6</italic> regulation</title><p>To determine whether SEF and Sp1 were involved in the regulation of <italic>PAX6</italic> gene expression, LN229 cells were co-transfected with the human <italic>PAX6</italic> promoter&#x02013;luciferase construct 346pGL3B, an Sp1 expression construct, Sp1&#x0002f;pCDNA3.1, or an SEF expression construct, SEF&#x0002f;pCS2&#x0002b;MT. Because SEF can bind and activate the SV40 major late promoter, the &#x003b2;-galactosidase-expressing vector pSV40-pSV2 cannot be used as an internal control in these transfection experiments. Instead, luciferase activity was normalized to the amount of protein in the cell lysate. The same amounts of 346pGL3B were used in each transfection experiment and different amounts of vector pCS2&#x0002b;MT were used to maintain the same total amount of DNA. The amount of SEF expression construct SEF&#x0002f;pCS2&#x0002b;MT was increased from 0 to 10 ng (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke490f7">7</xref>A) and the amount of Sp1 expression construct SP1&#x0002f;pCDNA3.1 was increased from 0 to 150 ng (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke490f7">7</xref>B). These results showed that SEF could increase <italic>PAX6</italic> gene promoter activity up to 4-fold (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke490f7">7</xref>A) and Sp1 could increase the promoter activity up to 6-fold (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke490f7">7</xref>B). Although there seems to be a physical interaction between SEF and SP1 this interaction alone does not result in synergistic activation of the <italic>PAX6</italic> promoter. It seems likely that other factors are necessary for high level transactivation.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Transcriptional regulatory regions of <italic>PAX6</italic> have been identified in mouse, quail, pufferfish and human. These regions are generally very highly conserved. The two upstream promoters P0 and P1 are remarkable in both their nucleotide sequence arrangement and spatio-temporal expression during evolution. The P0 promoter is activated at the onset of neuronal differentiation and P0 transcripts are found in the lens placode, corneal and conjuntival epithelia and pancreas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke490c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke490c2">2</xref>). <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements for P0 have been found within 6 kb upstream of the P0 promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke490c1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke490c3">3</xref>). The P1 promoter control region is less well characterized. P1-initiated transcripts are found in all eye structures expressing <italic>PAX6</italic> and several <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements have been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke490c1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke490c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke490c13">13</xref>), but no specific transcriptional activators have been identified.</p><p> Xu and Saunders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke490c13">13</xref>) previously cloned and characterized the human <italic>PAX6</italic> P1 promoter and identified the transcription initiation site and the 92 bp <italic>PAX6</italic> minimal promoter (bp&#x02013;62 to &#x0002b;30). They found by deletion analysis of the 346 bp fragment (&#x02013;180 to &#x0002b;166, pCSMNA) that multiple <italic>cis</italic> elements located upstream and downstream of the <italic>PAX6</italic> transcription initiation site are responsible for high level basal promoter activity and cell specificity. Using deletion mutants of the <italic>PAX6</italic> P1 promoter, Xu and Saunders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke490c13">13</xref>) performed transient transfection experiments in different cell lines and predicted that there may be a 57 bp enhancer in the P1 promoter region. In this paper we have identified and characterized this 57 bp region (E1E), which is important for expression of the human <italic>PAX6</italic> gene. This <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory element is located in the 5&#x02032;-untranslated region of the <italic>PAX6</italic> gene, 109 bp downstream of the transcription start site and 370 bp before the start of translation in <italic>PAX6</italic> mRNA. We have determined that the transcription factors SEF and Sp1 are essential transcription factors for E1E and that they up-regulate <italic>PAX6</italic> transcription.</p><p> By mutation of the putative TATA box in the <italic>PAX6</italic> P1 promoter and transient transfection experiments, we confirmed that the putative TATA box in the <italic>PAX6</italic> P1 minimal promoter is functional for the <italic>PAX6</italic> P1 promoter (data not shown).</p><p> Okladnova<italic> et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke490c20">20</xref>) identified an Isl-1 binding motif within the promoter P1. This was of particular interest because <italic>PAX6</italic> is a key regulator for normal pancreatic islet cell development and because Isl-1 is a LIM homeodomain transcription factor that is required for motor neuron and islet cell development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke490c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke490c21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke490c23">23</xref>). However, our supershift experiments showed no binding of E1E-2 (the putative Isl-1 binding motif indicated by Okladnova<italic> et al</italic>.; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke490c20">20</xref>) to anti-Isl-1 antibody and our transfection experiments showed that mutation of the E1E-2 region had no effect on <italic>PAX6</italic> promoter activity. These data indicate that Isl-1 was not the factor bound to E1E-2. Although we found weak sequence-specific binding to the E1E-2 sequence <italic>in vitro</italic>, our transient transfection data strongly implied that the protein(s) that bound to this region was not involved in the regulation of <italic>PAX6</italic> gene expression.</p><p> In EMSA no E1E-1 DNA&#x02013;protein complexes were formed. However, mutation of this region dramatically decreased <italic>PAX6</italic> P1 promoter activity. One possible explanation is that, because there is also a Sp1 binding site overlapping the E1E-1 region, the mutation in the E1E-1 region may affect the Sp1 site, thus affecting transcription regulation by Sp1. Alternatively, under our <italic>in vitro</italic> conditions we were unable to detect the transcription factor binding E1E-1.</p><p> Both our <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> results show that the E1E-3 region is critical for <italic>PAX6</italic> gene expression. When we searched the TESS transcription factor database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="www.cbil.upenn.edu&#x0002f;tess&#x0002f;">www.cbil.upenn.edu&#x0002f;tess&#x0002f;</ext-link>) the sequence of E1E-3 matched the sequence of the zinc finger protein D-Sry-&#x003b2; in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, which is involved in the&#x000a0;onset of zygotic transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke490c24">24</xref>) but has no known human&#x000a0;homolog. However, part of the E1E-3 region (5&#x02032;-CCAGTGAGGAGCGG) matched the consensus binding site of SEF (5&#x02032;-CNRGN<sub>5&#x02013;6</sub>CNRGN). As our EMSA and transient transfection experiments showed, SEF is an activator for <italic>PAX6</italic> transcription activation. Also, we have demonstrated an interaction between SEF and Sp1 <italic>in vitro</italic>. As our data show, the activity drops with increasing amounts of overexpressed Sp1 or SEF. Since co-transfection of SEF and Sp1 activates transcription slightly more than additively (data not shown), it is possible that additional factors besides SEF and Sp1 are involved in <italic>PAX6</italic> gene expression <italic>in vivo</italic>. Studies of how SEF and Sp1 regulate <italic>PAX6</italic> gene expression will provide a better understanding of the temporal and spatial regulation of <italic>PAX6</italic> gene expression.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gke490f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Nucleotide sequence of the P1 promoter of the human <italic>PAX6</italic> gene.
