The luciferase reporter gene assay revealed that ZNF131 inhibits ligand-dependent transactivation by ER&#x003b1; in a dose-dependent manner. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay clearly demonstrated that the interaction between ZNF131 and ER&#x003b1; interrupts or prevents ER&#x003b1; binding to the estrogen response element (ERE).

Estrogen exerts its biological actions by binding to two structurally and functionally distinct estrogen receptors (ER), &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. ER&#x003b1; is the major ER in human mammary epithelium. After binding with estrogen, it undergoes an activating conformational change that promotes its homodimerization and nuclear transportation. In the nucleus, the dimer is able to bind, with high affinity, to cis-acting enhancers known as estrogen response elements (ERE), which lie within the regulatory regions of target genes. The classical ERE, originally discovered in the Xenopus vitellogenin gene, consists of a 13-nucleotide inverted palindromic sequence separated by any three nucleotides (5' GGT CAN NNT GAC C 3') [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Through its mitogenic effect, estrogen is thought to play a role in breast cancer development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. As many as 70% of patients with breast cancer are estrogen-receptor positive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. ERs may play different pathophysiological roles at different stages of tumor progression, and may also be responsible for the increased incidence of breast cancer following hormone replacement therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Although several pathways have been reported, the E2-ER-ERE pathway is believed to be responsible for the mitogenic effect of estradiol and to play a crucial role in regulating its oncogenic expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>ER&#x003b1; activity can be regulated by a multitude of coregulatory factors, termed coactivators and corepressors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Although the biological role of estrogen-mediated activation of genes is well established, the significance of repression has only recently begun to be appreciated. ER&#x003b1; repressors are proposed to provide a counterbalance to estrogen-induced transactivation, and represent a mechanism that may be employed by the cell for tumor suppression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>The breast cancer and ovarian susceptibility gene 1 (BRCA1) has been shown to inhibit ER&#x003b1; signaling by repressing the AF-2 domain of ER&#x003b1;, which is linked to the ligand-binding domain. BRCA1 inhibits the estrogen-stimulated expression of pS2, cathepsin D, and a variety of other estrogen-responsive genes in this way [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The finding that BRCA1 is a corepressor of ER&#x003b1; provides a potential molecular explanation for the tissue-specific nature of BRCA1-associated cancer. However, cancer-causing mutations of BRCA1 only account for 5&#x02013;10% of breast cancer. Therefore, it is conceivable that additional factors having a similar corepressor activity may participate in the same regulatory process, and that defects in these may contribute to the etiology of some forms of breast cancer. Thus, our efforts have been devoted to identifying novel human genes, which, like BRCA1, repress ER&#x003b1; activity.</p><p>Genetic screen in various model organisms is one means to identify useful genes from the flood of sequence information from the various genome projects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Recent advances in cell-based, genetic, high-throughput screening provide an efficient approach to explore gene function and disease relevance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. These strategies offer the advantages of speed, cost-effectiveness, genome coverage, and immediate biological relevance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. In an effort to identify human genes involved in regulating activity of ER&#x003b1;, we constructed a high-throughput, cell-based functional screening platform by linking a response element (ERE) with a reporter gene. This has enabled us to make a quantitative assessment of the effect of candidate genes on the cellular activity of ER&#x003b1;, in the presence or absence of its cognate ligand E2. We describe here the identification and characterization of ZNF131, a novel repressor of ER&#x003b1; mediated transactivation. In addition, the mRNA and protein levels of pS2/TFF1, an estrogen responsive gene, were downregulated by ZNF131.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Plasmids</title><p>We constructed a cDNA library from the human RefSeq database <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/RefSeq/"/>.

The full-length cDNA of these candidate genes was inserted into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1/myc-His (-) B (pcDB) (Invitrogen, USA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. This cDNA library, containing 570 genes, was then screened. The reporter plasmid pGL4-ERE-LUC was obtained by inserting the following two annealed oligonucleotides between the Xho I-Hind III sites of the multiple cloning site of the luciferase reporter vector pGL4-basic (Promega, Madison, WI): 5' TCG AGA GGT CAC AGT GAC CTA GGT CAC AGT GAC CTA GAT CTG GGC ATA TAA TGGA-3' and 5'-AGC TTC CAT TAT ATA CCC AGA TCT AGG TCA CTG TGA CCT AGG TCA CTG TGA CCTC-3'.

A total of 95.1 ng plasmid DNA per well were used, comprising 40 ng pGL4-ERE-LUC, 5 ng pRL-TK, 0.1 ng ER&#x003b1; and 50 ng of the candidate gene. 24 h later, the transfected cells were treated with 100 nM 17&#x003b2;-estradiol (E2, Sigma) or 0.1% vehicle (ethanol) for 12 h. Each experiment of non-stimulation and stimulation was performed in triplicate wells.

Candidate ER-repressor gene cDNAs were cloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDB; this empty vector and BRCA1 were used as the negative and positive control, respectively. Reporter gene activity was first normalized to Renilla luciferase activity obtained by cotransfection of an internal control pRL-TK expression plasmid.

From a library of 570 clones tested, we identified 8 candidate clones in the first round of screening (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, Additional Material).

The best-characterized corepressor, NcoR, can interact with ER&#x003b1; in the presence of ER&#x003b1; antagonists. Antiestrogen drugs include agents such as tamoxifen, toremefene, raloxifene and fulwestrant. The clinical use of antiestrogens is currently limited to compounds that block the interaction of estrogens of all sources with the ER&#x003b1;. Although these compounds are useful, none identified to date is purely antiestrogenic, and their clinical effectiveness varies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Currently, both tamoxifen and raloxifene are most frequently used in breast cancer chemoprevention. However, tamoxifen's antagonist activity was abolished in NcoR -/- mouse embryo fibroblasts (MEFs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], and raloxifene did not provide protection against noninvasive carcinoma as observed in the CORE trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Thus, finding more ER&#x003b1; repressors might be help in designing therapeutic strategies directed toward epigenetic mechanisms in prevention or treatment of breast cancer.</p><p>In the present study, we constructed a high-throughput, cell-based functional screening platform by linking a response element (ERE) to a reporter gene, which allowed us to quantitatively analyze the cellular activity of ER&#x003b1; in cells cotransfected with the candidate genes, in the presence or absence of its cognate ligand E2. We first had to choose an appropriate cell line in which to carry out the assays. Cell transfection efficiency, convenience, and cost were each taken into account. The ER&#x003b1; positive breast cancer cell lines MCF7 and T47D are frequently used to study the influence of genes on the function of ER&#x003b1;. However, the poor transfection efficiency achievable using conventional transfection reagent in these cell lines prompted us to seek a substitute. We chose HeLa cells because they offer good transfection efficiency and are strictly ER&#x003b1; AF-2 permissive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Because HeLa cells are ER&#x003b1;-negative, our assay required cotransfection of a plasmid expressing ER&#x003b1; (hER&#x003b1;). The assay described above confirmed that E2 was able to activate ER&#x003b1; in these cells and ER&#x003b1; exogenously introduced into HeLa cells could restore ER&#x003b1; signaling in response to estrogen.</p><p>From an initial screen of a library of 570 human cDNA clones, we identified four genes for further validation, and ultimately identified ZNF131 as the strongest repressor of ER&#x003b1;-mediated transactivation.</p><p>ZNF131 is a novel gene whose function is not yet well understood. It was isolated and chromosomally mapped in 1995, together with a group of 15 other novel human zinc finger proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], most of which were considered to be putative candidate genes for developmental and malignant disorders. Analysis of the expression profile of ZNF131 revealed it to be ubiquitously expressed in both the human and mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], with a highest expression in adult testis, thymus, and brain. Our results are in agreement with this expression pattern, with the additional finding of significant expression in lung.</p><p>ZNF131 protein has been placed in the superfamily of POK (BTB/POZ and kr&#x000fc;ppel) proteins, which contain a BTB/POZ domain in their N-terminal region as well as 5 typical C2H2 zinc fingers, and an additional C2HC zinc finger structure, in their C-terminus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. In POK proteins, including ZNF131, the BTB/POZ domain putatively confers a specific nuclear localization pattern and mediates transcriptional repression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. We confirmed the nuclear localization of human ZNF131 in HeLa cells using a ZNF131-GFP expression construct (data not shown).</p><p>The potency of ZNF131 in inhibiting ER&#x003b1;-mediated transcriptional activity in cultured cells was reflected by its dose-dependent inhibition of ligand-dependent transactivation of ER&#x003b1;. EMSA assays showed that the addition of estrogen to HeLa nuclear extracts increased the binding of ER&#x003b1; to ERE, but that overexpression of ZNF131 impaired this activation by destabilizing the E2-ER-ERE complex. The action of ZNF131 was specific, dependent on estradiol, and effective even at high estradiol concentrations.</p><p>The MCF-7 cell line was among the first ER-positive human breast cancer cell lines to be characterized as responsive to the mitogenic effects of estrogens in cell culture, as well as in athymic nude mice bearing MCF-7 cell xenografts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Further, MCF-7 cells demonstrate estrogen-stimulated expression of a number of well-characterized estrogen-responsive genes, including Cathepsin D and pS2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Overexpression of ZNF131 in MCF-7 cells led a marked reduction in the expression of pS2 protein, but not of Cathepsin D (data not shown). This suggests that pS2 is a specific target gene of ZNF131. Overexpression of ZNF131 in HeLa cells also repressed pS2 mRNA and protein level.</p><p>The pS2 gene product is a well-known estrogen-inducible protein that is expressed in breast and gastrointestinal tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Expression of pS2 has been used as a marker of estrogen responsiveness in ER containing breast cancer cells, and as a candidate indicator of disease progression to predict the success of antiestrogen therapy. pS2, along with ER&#x003b1;, represent strongly favorable prognostic index in breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Although elevated expression of pS2 predicts a more benign course in breast cancer cases, the mechanism by which this is regulated in human breast cancer cells is not yet well understood. Our finding that overexpression of the ZNF131 protein significantly reduced the level of pS2 in MCF-7 and HeLa cells might contribute to an understanding of the expression of pS2 in normal and neoplastic cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, we utilized a high-throughput screening system and identified a protein, ZNF131, which represses ligand-dependent ER&#x003b1; transactivation and is able to regulate expression of the estrogen-responsive gene pS2. This might provide new insight into designing therapeutic and prognostic strategies of breast cancer. Our observations suggest that ZNF131 as a new ER&#x003b1; repressor correlates with pS2, while cell changes induced by gene overexpression do not necessarily mimic physiological responses in vivo. It is clear that additional studies need to be conducted to understand the regulatory mechanisms and physiological roles of ZNF131. Appropriate in vitro experiments might, first, include the inactivation of ZNF131 through RNAi to decrease endogenous protein level. In addition, ChIP assays might allow further study the mechanism of sequential recruitment of ER&#x003b1;-containing protein complexes to estrogen-target promoters, and allow investigators to generate libraries of repressor-bound promoters.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>ZNF131: zinc finger protein 131; BRCA1: breast cancer and ovarian susceptibility gene 1; pS2/TFF1: trefoil factor 1; E<sub>2</sub>: estradiol; Er&#x003b1;: estrogen receptor &#x003b1;; pcDB: mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1/myc-His (-) B; EMSA: electrophoretic mobility shift assay</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>Han X participated in the design of the study, carried out the high-throughput screen, performed the validation assays, and was pivotal in drafting the manuscript.
