Importantly, we found that, in absence of aPKC&#x003bb;, cell fate depends on the cellular context: depletion of aPKC&#x003bb; in all cells results in a strong reduction of inner cells at the 16-cell stage, while inhibition of aPKC&#x003bb; in only half of the embryo biases the progeny of aPKC&#x003bb; defective blastomeres towards the inner cell mass.

Cell shape is able to influence both the type of division (symmetric or asymmetric) and the position of the blastomeres within the embryo.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>During development two major mechanisms are involved to generate cell diversity: asymmetric cell divisions, leading to the formation of two different daughter cells, and cellular interactions, leading previously identical cells to adopt distinct fate. The morphogenesis of the mouse blastocyst provides an excellent system to study these two mechanisms. During preimplantation development, two distinct cell populations are first observed at the 16-cell stage that can be distinguished by both their position (outside and inside) and their phenotype (polarized and non-polarized, respectively). This difference is maintained in the blastocyst where a layer of epithelial cells, the trophectoderm, surrounds a cavity and a group of undifferentiated cells, the inner cell mass.</p><p>In the late 60s, it was shown that changing the position of blastomeres within the embryo could change their fate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007117-Mintz1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. This observation led Tarkowski and Wroblewska to propose the &#x000ab; inside - outside &#x000bb; model where the position of a blastomere at the 16-cell stage drives it towards a trophectodermal (outside) or an inner cell mass (inside) fate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007117-Tarkowski1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. In outer cells, the area of the membrane facing the external milieu is not engaged in cell-cell contacts (asymmetry of contacts), while inner cells are completely surrounded by other cells. This leads outside cells to differentiate into epithelial cells while inner cells remain undifferentiated. These observations emphasize the role of extrinsic factors (cell interactions) during blastocyst morphogenesis.</p><p>In the early 80s, a cell biological approach led Johnson and colleagues to propose that the phenotypic divergence between inside cells and outside cells resulted from the polarization of blastomeres at the 8-cell stage during compaction and from its unequal inheritance through asymmetric divisions at the 8- to 16-cell stage transition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007117-Johnson1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. At the 8-cell stage, during compaction, each blastomere polarizes its cytoplasm and its cortex along an apico-basal axis, and the development of an adhesive basolateral cortical domain leads to the flattening of blastomeres upon one another (for review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007117-Dard1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>). Cell polarization at the 8-cell stage depends on extrinsic (cell adhesion, basolateral cue) and intrinsic (microtubule network, apical cue) factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007117-Houliston1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. During the following mitosis, cytoplasmic polarity is lost, but the apical cortical domain remains stable, allowing blastomeres that inherit it to re-establish cell polarity. Moreover, since the axis of polarity at the 8-cell stage is radial, after an asymmetric cell division the polarized daughter cell is already located at the periphery while the non-polarized cell is positioned towards the inside of the embryo. At the 16-cell stage, because the apical surface is less adhesive than the basolateral membrane, polar cells tend to engulf non-polar cells that are uniformly adhesive, thus reinforcing the positioning of these polarized cells at the periphery of the embryo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007117-Johnson2">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Another mechanism plays an important role during blastocyst morphogenesis: cell shape. Cell shape is dependent upon different factors such as cortical tension, adhesive properties and the cellular environment. Cell shape plays a major role to control the number of inside and outside cells during the 16- to 32-cell stage transition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007117-Fleming1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007117-Johnson3">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. The number of polarized blastomeres that divide asymmetrically is very variable during the 8- to 16-cell stage transition, because spindle orientation is not controlled <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007117-Pickering1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore in the 16-cell stage embryo, the outer/inner cell ratio in most embryos lies in the range between 9/7 and 14/2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007117-Johnson3">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. However, this ratio is much less variable at the 32-cell. Indeed, the number of inner and outer cells influences cell shape at the 16-cell stage, and consequently spindle orientation during the 16- to 32-cell stage transition: when there is a low number of inner cells, outside cells are elongated along the radial axis of the embryo and mitotic spindles adjust along this radial axis and thus outer cells tend to divide asymmetrically, thereby increasing the number of inner cells. Reversely, when the number of inside cells is high, outer cells are flattened at the surface of the embryo and mitotic spindles orientate parallel to the surface, and thus outer cells tend to divide symmetrically, thereby maintaining the inner/outer cell ratio (dividing inner cells always give rise to two inner daughter cells).</p><p>Many efforts have been made to characterize the molecular mechanisms driving blastocysts morphogenesis, and especially inner cell mass and trophectodermal cells allocation, during the last decade. In particular, the maintenance of inner cell mass (ICM) and trophectoderm (TE) fates requires the transcription factors Cdx2 and Oct4, whose expression is restricted to the TE and ICM, respectively, after the initiation of blastocyst formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007117-Strumpf1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007117-Yamanaka1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Cdx2 is required for the repression of <italic>oct4</italic> in the TE. However, this protein is dispensable for TE specification since <italic>cdx2</italic> -/- embryos form expanded blastocysts. The correlation between <italic>cdx2</italic> expression and lineage allocation is controversial. Actually, a position independent variability of <italic>cdx2</italic> expression is observed from the 16-cell to 32-cell stage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007117-Dietrich1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007117-Ralston1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover, <italic>cdx2</italic> mutant blastomeres contribute to both ICM and TE and the expression and localization of aPKC is not affected <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007117-Ralston1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Whereas these two papers conclude that early stochastic processes control their expression pattern and that the definite pattern is established downstream of lineage allocation, another study claims that the expression level of <italic>cdx2</italic> influences cell position and the overexpression of <italic>cdx2</italic> in blastomeres induced a more extensive and concentrated aPKC localization to the apical poles of the blastomeres <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007117-Jedrusik1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Thus, blastocyst morphogenesis and early lineage divergence seem to be controlled by the interplay between cellular mechanisms involving positional information, cell-cell interactions, cell shape, cell polarization and asymmetric cell divisions. In order to evaluate the importance of cell polarity in the determination of cell fate we have decided to disturb the activity of the aPKC/PAR6 apical complex in different cellular contexts. Indeed, we have previously reported that members of the PAR/aPKC protein family are expressed in the preimplantation mouse embryo and display a polarized distribution from the 8-cell stage onwards <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007117-Vinot1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, the PAR6/aPKC complex accumulates at the apical cortex at the onset of compaction at the 8-cell stage and remains stable during mitosis at the 8- to 16-cell stage transition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007117-Vinot1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007117-Thomas1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. While PAR6 is maternally expressed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007117-Vinot1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, aPKC&#x003bb; and aPKC&#x003b6; are not <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007117-Vinot1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007117-Thomas1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, allowing inactivation of their activity by RNA interference. Down-regulation of aPKC in a small number of blastomeres was previously reported to increase the number of inner cells through a modification of spindle orientation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007117-Plusa1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. Here, we show that when early stabilization of cell polarity is impaired by inactivation of aPKC&#x003bb; in all or half blastomeres , cell allocation is dependent upon the cellular context and controlled by cell shape and is independent of spindle orientation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethic Statement</title><p>All animals used in experiments reported in this publication were housed and handled by persons skilled by institutional committee according to CNRS and French Agriculture Department (agreement #A75-05-13).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Recovery and culture of mouse embryos</title><p>Recovery and culture of embryos were performed as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007117-Dard2">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>.

One of the major events is the maturation of junctions, characterized by the step-by-step accumulation of tight junction components at the border between the apical and basolateral domains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007117-Eckert1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. Tight junctions form a diffusion barrier between these two membrane domains and thus stabilize cell polarity. In control embryos, ZO-1 and cingulin, two components of the tight junctions, were detected as apico-lateral dots between outer cells forming a characteristic belt-like staining in 3D reconstructions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007117-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>) as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007117-Sheth1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007117-Fleming2">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. In siRNA-aPKC&#x003bb; injected embryos, ZO-1 and cingulin were mislocalized to the apical pole and diffusely distributed along cell contacts and in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007117-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). These data suggest that aPKC&#x003bb;-defective cells show defects in the development of tight junctions. This was confirmed by electron microscopy analysis at the 16-cell stage since we never observed a tight junction structure in siRNA-aPKC&#x003bb; injected embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007117-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). Similarly, inactivation of aPKC&#x003bb; in other systems led to abnormal localization of several tight junction proteins: occludin was localized to the apical membrane in Xenopus embryo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007117-Chalmers1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref> and ZO-1, occludin and claudin-1 disappeared from cell-cell boundaries in mammalian epithelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007117-Suzuki1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007117-Suzuki2">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. Disruption of tight junctions induces the loss of apico-basal boundaries, which is likely to result in inter-domain diffusion of molecules and impaired asymmetric distribution of membrane proteins. Therefore, the localization of the apical marker ezrin was studied. In control embryos, ezrin was exclusively found at the apical domain of outer blastomeres, whereas some staining was also detected at the basolateral domain, in addition to the apical staining, in aPKC&#x003bb;-depleted embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007117-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). Measurement of the apical and basolateral domains length of blastomeres revealed that inactivation of aPKC&#x003bb; resulted in the restriction of the apical domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007117-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>) as observed in Drosophila, mouse and Xenopus epithelia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007117-Chalmers1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007117-Imai1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>.

Surprisingly, staining of E-cadherin engaged in homophilic interactions was weaker in aPKC&#x003bb;-depleted embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007117-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>), although we did not observe any significant redistribution of E-cadherin into the cytosol and expression of total E-cadherin was not modified (data not shown). By contrast, we observed a strong accumulation of phospho-myosin at the apical cortex in aPKC&#x003bb;-depleted embryos compared to control embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007117-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>), indicating that apical myosin II is up-regulated.

Adhesion and cortical tension are inter-dependent because both are supported by actin filaments. It has been described that a decrease in the number of cortical microfilaments stabilizing E-cadherin complexes and an increase in the number of microfilaments anchored to the plasma membrane through ezrin would increase cortical tension <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007117-Lecuit1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007117-Kunda1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>.

In order to analyze the orientation of mitotic spindles during this transition, 3D movies of embryos expressing a tubulin-GFP fusion protein were recorded by video-microscopy. From these movies, we measured the &#x003b1; angle formed between two vectors: the first vector defined by the two poles of the metaphase spindle of each dividing blastomere, and the second one corresponding to the radial axis going from the centroid of the embryo to the center of each mitotic spindle (corresponding to the apico-basal axis of polarity of blastomeres). Once the spindle formed, its orientation did not change until telophase. From our data, asymmetric divisions take place when the &#x003b1; angle formed by the spindle axis and the radial axis (axis of polarity of the cell) is lower than 50&#x000b0; (we observed a mean number of 3.1 inside cells/embryo (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0007117-t002">Table 2</xref>) corresponding to 39&#x00025; of asymmetric divisions and the threshold &#x003b1; angle value was at 50&#x000b0; for 39&#x00025; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007117-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>, blue bars)). In absence of aPKC&#x003bb; expression, the orientation of spindles differs when compared to control embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007117-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>, red bars): this &#x003b1; angle was below 50&#x000b0; in 57&#x00025; of the aPKC&#x003bb;-depleted embryos (compared to 39&#x00025; in control embryos). These results indicate that upon inhibition of aPKC&#x003bb; expression a higher proportion of mitotic spindles tend to align with the axis of polarity. These data also reveal that cell allocation within the embryo does not systematically reflect the orientation of spindle during mitosis. Therefore, attempts to conclude on symmetric versus asymmetric divisions from the analysis of cell position at the 16-cell stage may lead to errors of interpretation if spindle orientation is not checked in parallel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007117-Jedrusik1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007117-Plusa1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Since cortical polarity is stable during mitosis in aPKC&#x003bb;-depleted embryos during the 8-cell to 16-cell stage transition, this preferential spindle orientation should generate a higher number of inside cells at the 16-cell stage (from 3 to 4). However, a decrease in this number was observed (from 3 to 0.8). A more careful analysis of movies suggests that rapidly after mitosis, the cell that inherits the basolateral side of the mother cell (when the division is asymmetric) does not display an inner allocation but rather relocates at the periphery of the embryo and starts to polarize (due to the asymmetry of contacts) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007117-g006">Fig. 6</xref>). This reorganization could be achieved because cortical polarity is not stabilized in aPKC&#x003bb;-depleted blastomeres (allowing flexibility of the different cortical domains in polarized cells) and because of a stronger cortical tension. The relative tissue surface tension for both cell types would be similar, making differential adhesion less effective, as suggested by the decrease in E-cadherin staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007117-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>). Thus, inner cells would tend to keep a more rounded shape and outer polarized cells would not tend to engulf inside cells, thereby leading non polarized cells to move to the periphery, where they will develop an apical pole of microvilli, due to the asymmetry in cell contacts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007117-Johnson4">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><fig id="pone-0007117-g006" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0007117.g006</object-id><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>Relocation of blastomeres at the periphery after an asymmetric division in aPKC&#x003bb; depleted embryos.</title><p>(A): Spinning disk microscope analysis of a siRNA-Crtl injected embryo expressing exogenous tubulin-GFP during the 8- to 16-cell stage mitosis (time between images: 20 min).

In order to study the behavior of aPKC&#x003bb; depleted blastomeres in a different cellular context, we decided to study the effect of aPKC&#x003bb; inactivation in only part of the embryo. mRNAs encoding either wild-type aPKC&#x003bb; (aPKC&#x003bb;-WT) or kinase dead aPKC&#x003bb; (aPKC&#x003bb;-K273E) fused to GFP were injected in one blastomere at the two-cell stage. The mean proportion of GFP-tagged blastomeres was similar to untagged blastomeres in both groups of embryos at the 16- and 32-cell stages (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0007117-t003">Table 3</xref>), indicating that expression of these aPKC&#x003bb; constructs had no effect on cell division rate. We did not notice any significant difference at the 16-cell stage, aPKC&#x003bb;-WT and aPKC&#x003bb;-K273E expressing blastomeres contributing to inner and outer cells to the same extent (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0007117-t003">Table 3</xref>). By contrast, at the 32-cell stage, the contribution of aPKC&#x003bb; defective blastomeres to inner cell mass was significantly higher compared to blastomeres derived from the non-injected blastomere (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0007117-t003">Table 3</xref>). Indeed, 10 out of 16 (&#x02248;62&#x00025;) aPKC&#x003bb;-K273E expressing cells were found in the inner cell mass, representing almost 3/4 of the total inner cell mass population. By contrast, 5 out of 16 aPKC&#x003bb;-WT expressing cells were detected in the inner cell mass and represented about 45&#x00025; of the total inner cell mass population. Consistent with these results, the number of inner cells was higher in aPKC&#x003bb;-K273E injected embryos (14.0; 42&#x00025;) compared to aPKC&#x003bb;-WT (11.4; 36&#x00025;) injected ones or non-injected controls (10.7; 34&#x00025;). Thus, the mosaic disruption of aPKC&#x003bb; activity in embryos interferes with the ability of blastomeres to contribute to trophectoderm lineage, and biases the progeny of aPKC&#x003bb; defective blastomeres towards the inner cell mass, in agreement with a previous study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007117-Plusa1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. These results also show that almost all outer 16-cell blastomeres expressing aPKC&#x003bb;-K273E divide asymmetrically while wild-type blastomeres divide symmetrically. This can be also explained by the difference in cortical tension existing between the two cell types: dividing wild-type outer blastomeres will be more flattened than dividing mutant outer blastomeres that exhibit a higher cortical tension.</p><table-wrap id="pone-0007117-t003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0007117.t003</object-id><label>Table 3</label><caption><title>Effect of mosaic aPKC&#x003bb;-inactivation on cell allocation at 16-cell stage.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone-0007117-t003-3" xlink:href="pone.0007117.t003"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Microinjected mRNA (in one 2-cell stage blastomere)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Percentage of GFP positive cells (mean<bold>&#x000b1;</bold>SEM)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Number of inner cells (mean<bold>&#x000b1;</bold>SEM)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Number of GFP inner cells (mean<bold>&#x000b1;</bold>SEM)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Number of outer cells (mean<bold>&#x000b1;</bold>SEM)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Number of GFP outer cells (mean&#x000b1;SEM)</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="6" align="left" rowspan="1">16-cell stage</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">aPKC&#x003bb;-K273E (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;16)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">50.4&#x000b1;0.4&#x00025;</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2&#x000b1;0.2<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="nt108">&#x0002a;</xref></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1&#x000b1;0.2</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">14&#x000b1;0.2</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7&#x000b1;0.2</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">aPKC&#x003bb;-WT (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;14)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">50.6&#x000b1;0.6&#x00025;</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">3.1&#x000b1;0.3</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1.3&#x000b1;0.3</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">13&#x000b1;0.3</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6.8&#x000b1;0.3</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Non-injected Ctrl (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;46)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02013;</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2.6&#x000b1;0.2</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02013;</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">13.5&#x000b1;0.2</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02013;</td></tr><tr><td colspan="6" align="left" rowspan="1">32-cell stage</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">aPKC&#x003bb;-K273E (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;16)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">49.9&#x000b1;0.5&#x00025;</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">14&#x000b1;0.4<sup>#</sup></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10&#x000b1;0.8<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="nt109">##</xref></td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">19&#x000b1;0.3</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6&#x000b1;0.8</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">aPKC&#x003bb;-WT (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;14)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">48.3&#x000b1;0.9&#x00025;</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">11.4&#x000b1;0.4</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4.9&#x000b1;0.4</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">19.4&#x000b1;0.4</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">9.9&#x000b1;0.3</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Non-injected Ctrl (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;42)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02013;</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10.7&#x000b1;0.4</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02013;</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">20.6&#x000b1;0.4</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x02013;</td></tr></tbody></table></alternatives><table-wrap-foot><fn id="nt107"><label/><p>n: number of embryos analyzed.</p></fn><fn id="nt108"><label/><p>&#x0002a;p&#x0003c;0.005 and &#x0003c;0.04 using the unpaired t-test with Welch correction when mRNA aPKC&#x003bb;-K273E samples were compared to mRNA aPKC&#x003bb;-WT or non-injected samples respectively.</p></fn><fn id="nt109"><label>##</label><p>p&#x0003c;0.0001 using the unpaired t-test with Welch correction when mRNA aPKC&#x003bb;-K273E samples were compared to mRNA aPKC&#x003bb;-WT.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>Taken together, these data indicate that disruption of aPKC&#x003bb; activity results in different phenotypes depending on the cell context. Indeed, we observed a strong drop of inner cell number at the 16-cell stage when aPKC&#x003bb; activity was inhibited in all blastomeres but not when inhibition was performed in only half of the blastomeres. This difference may result from the normal E-cadherin staining observed at the interface between mutant and normal cells (data not shown), which might block the outward migration of inner cells after the 8- to 16-cell stage transition. Moreover, aPKC&#x003bb; defective embryos displayed a quasi-normal number of inner cells at the 32-cell stage, suggesting that a compensatory mechanism is at work during the 16- to 32-cell stage transition to re-establish a correct number of inner cells at the blastocyst stage (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0007117-t002">Table 2</xref>). When aPKC&#x003bb; activity is suppressed in only half of the blastomeres, this results in an enrichment of aPKC&#x003bb; defective blastomeres in the inner cell mass at the 32-cell stage. Therefore, these experiments show that the position of aPKC&#x003bb;-depleted blastomeres is dependent upon both intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Among the intrinsic factors, forces involved in the control of cell shape might be at work when cell polarity is not stabilized.</p></sec><sec id="s3b4"><title>Cell shape control lineage allocation</title><p>As stated in the introduction, the role of cell shape in spindle orientation and compensation of the number of inner cells was already known. However, our studies pointed to a role of cell shape in controlling cell position and thus lineage allocation. In our previous experiments, the inactivation of aPKC&#x003bb; led to changes in cortical tension and adhesive properties. Thus, we decided to test the role of cell shape on cell allocation. We used embryos derived from a single 2-cell blastomere. The only difference between these embryos (called N/2-cell stage) and control embryos (called N-cell stage) at the same molecular stage is that the 3D shape of the N/2-cell stage embryo will be similar (although smaller, but homothetic) to the 3D shape of an N-cell stage embryo at one embryonic stage earlier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007117-g007">Fig. 7</xref>): i.e. 32/2-cell stage embryos will be similar to 16-cell stage embryos as far as cell shape is concerned. The percentage of inside cells in 32/2-cell stage embryos was 15&#x00025; (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;9) a value similar to the one observed in 16-cell stage embryos (16&#x00025;; n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;46) and much lower than the one observed in 32-cell stage embryos (41&#x00025;; n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;42) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0007117-t003">Table 4</xref>). Since blastomeres in 32-cell stage embryos and in 32/2-cell embryos are exactly at the same molecular age, this result reinforces the conclusion that cell shape plays an important role in lineage allocation.

This value is similar to the one observed in 16-cell stage wild-type embryos (16&#x00025;). This is likely due to the ability of aPKC&#x003bb;-depleted 32-cell stage blastomeres to establish tight junctions and to stabilize cortical polarity, thus behaving like wild-type cells.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The divergence of lineages between the trophectoderm and the inner cell mass in the preimplantation mouse embryo is dependent upon both intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Our study shows that in addition to cell polarization at compaction and the existence of asymmetric divisions during the following mitosis, the aPKC&#x003bb;-dependent stabilization of cortical domains during the 16-cell stage is critical for cell lineage divergence. As observed in other systems, aPKC&#x003bb; plays a major role in the very first steps of tight junctions formation, which are essential to maintain a physical border between the apical and basolateral domains, stabilizing cell polarity and blocking the diffusion of membrane molecules between the apical and basolateral domains of the epithelial cells. Finally, we bring to light for the first time a role for cell shape in interphasic blastomere (dependent upon cortical tension and cell adhesion) in cell allocation: aPKC&#x003bb; influences cortical tension and intercellular adhesion, thereby controlling cell shape and cell position within the embryo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007117-g008">Fig. 8</xref>). Positional information controls cell fate through the asymmetry of cell contact, a major cue for epithelial differentiation. Cell shape also modulates the ratio between symmetric and asymmetric divisions at the 8- to 16- and 16- to 32-cell stage, thus controlling the number of cells allocated to each of the first two lineages. The interplay between these different factors explains the robustness and the highly regulative aspects of preimplantation development. It is only when a blastocyst is formed, with its cavity and the two established cell lineages, that cell fate is fixed through the differential expression of tissue-specific transcription factors allocation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007117-Dietrich1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007117-Ralston1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><fig id="pone-0007117-g008" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0007117.g008</object-id><label>Figure 8</label><caption><title>Lineage allocation during mouse preimplantation development.</title><p>Until the early 8-cell stage, blastomeres are apolar. At compaction, blastomeres polarize and flatten upon each other. During the following mitosis, they divide either symmetrically (S) or asymmetrically (A). Although spindle orientation is random, the ratio between symmetrical and asymmetrical cell divisions can be modulated by cell shape constraints. After division, non-polar cells are localized inside the embryo (since they are derived from the basal part of 8-cell blastomeres) while polar cells are located at the periphery. At the 16-cell stage, before the formation of tight junctions (or in their absence) cell shape constraints can force inside cells to move at the periphery (red arrow). These cells will polarize because of the asymmetry of intercellular contacts. At the 16- to 32- cell transition, in 16-cell stage embryos containing only a small number of inside non-polarized blastomeres, cell shape constraints favor asymmetrical cell divisions in outside polarized blastomeres to increase the number of inside non-polarized cells.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0007117.g008"/></fig></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s4"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0007117.s001"><label>Video S1</label><caption><p>Video-microscope analysis of control-siRNA (left panel) and siRNA-aPKC&#x003bb; (right panel) injected embryos.
