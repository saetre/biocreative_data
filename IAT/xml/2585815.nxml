Acute exercise is associated with increased sensitivity to the effects of leptin on food intake in an IL-6-dependent manner. To determine whether exercise ameliorates the AMPK and mTOR response to leptin in the hypothalamus in an IL-6-dependent manner, rats performed two 3-h exercise bouts, separated by one 45-min rest period. Intracerebroventricular IL-6 infusion reduced food intake and pretreatment with AMPK activators and mTOR inhibitor prevented IL-6-induced anorexia. Activators of AMPK and fasting increased food intake in control rats to a greater extent than that observed in exercised ones, whereas inhibitor of AMPK had the opposite effect. Furthermore, the reduction of AMPK and ACC phosphorylation and increase in phosphorylation of proteins involved in mTOR signal transduction, observed in the hypothalamus after leptin infusion, were more pronounced in both lean and diet-induced obesity rats after acute exercise. Treatment with leptin reduced food intake in exercised rats that were pretreated with vehicle, although no increase in responsiveness to leptin-induced anorexia after pretreatment with anti-IL6 antibody, AICAR or Rapamycin was detected. Thus, the effects of leptin on the AMPK/mTOR pathway, potentiated by acute exercise, may contribute to appetite suppressive actions in the hypothalamus.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="17"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Prolonged exercise of medium to high intensity is known to profoundly affect energy balance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003856-Richard1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003856-Rivest1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.

Multiple factors control food intake, including hormones, fuels and behaviour. AMPK is the downstream component of a kinase cascade that acts as a sensor of cellular energy charge, being activated by rising AMP coupled with falling ATP.

Our data indicate that IL-6 signaling through AMPK and mTOR reduces food intake in a dose-dependent manner. Leptin, as well as &#x003b1;-LA infusion, reduced food intake in exercised rats to a greater extent than that observed in control animals. Conversely, AICAR, 2-DG and fasting increased food intake in exercised rats to a lower extent than that observed in control animals. Exercise was associated with the effects of leptin on the AMPK/mTOR pathway activity in the hypothalamus. In addition, we investigated the regulatory role of IL-6 in mediating the increase in leptin responsiveness in the hypothalamus. Treatment with leptin markedly reduced food intake, AMPK activity and increased mTOR activity in exercised rats that were pretreated with vehicle, although no increase in response to leptin-induced anorexia and modulation of AMPK/mTOR pathway were detected after i.c.v. pretreatment with anti-IL-6 antibody. Taken together, these results suggest that IL-6 is a major component of the effects of exercise on the control of food intake.</p><p>Increasing evidence shows that leptin and IL-6 activates AMPK in the peripheral tissues, such as skeletal muscle and adipose tissue, increasing fatty acid oxidation and glucose uptake in these tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003856-Daval1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003856-Minokoshi2">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>, however, leptin has an opposing effect in hypothalamic tissue, reducing neuronal AMPK activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003856-Minokoshi1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003856-Andersson1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>.

In peripheral tissues, such as skeletal muscle, activation of AMPK switches on energy producing pathways and switches off energy consuming pathways. In the hypothalamus, activation of AMPK leads to increased feeding, thereby increasing energy intake. Conversely, inhibition of AMPK in the hypothalamus reduces food intake. These dual functions of AMPK suggest that it may act to coordinate energy expenditure with energy intake. There is already some evidence that this may be the case in one situation. More recently, Gao and colleagues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003856-Gao1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref> demonstrated that the hypothalamic ACC activation makes an important contribution to the anorexigenic effects of leptin that are mediated by AMPK. The aim of this study was to investigate whether IL-6 could affect AMPK activity in the hypothalamus, thereby providing a potential mechanism for the coordination of energy expenditure and energy intake during, or following exercise. Beyond STAT3 activation, we detected changes in the hypothalamic AMPK activity in rats after i.c.v. infusion of IL-6; we show that, IL-6 markedly decreased phospho-AMPK abundance (an index of activity) in the hypothalamus.

However, central IL-6 treatment at the same dose that we used does not influence food intake in mice.

Furthermore, fasting and the use of another activator of AMPK (2-DG) in exercising rats resulted in a lower activation of AMPK when compared to the control animals.

Several lines of evidence point to a possible link between inhibited AMPK-induced food intake in the hypothalamus and IL-6 signaling through the AMPK/mTOR pathway. Firstly, we found that the leptin-inhibited food intake enhanced by exercise was blunted by anti-IL-6 antibody. Secondly, exercise induced increased response of leptin-inhibited AMPK signaling was reverted by AICAR. Finally, exercise induced increased responsiveness of leptin stimulated mTOR signaling was reverted by rapamycin.</p><p>Our data are in accordance with earlier studies demonstrating that IL-6 treatment enhances energy expenditure in both rodents and humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003856-Wallenius1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003856-Stouthard1">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003856-Tsigos1">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref>.

At first glance, these data appear to be contradictory. However, a large decrease in insulin level was observed after exercise, and we have previously shown a synergic effect of IL-6 on the insulin and leptin signaling pathway, in the rat hypothalamus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003856-Flores1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Since we did not observe modifications in the phosphorylation of JAK2 and the downstream targets of mTOR after exercise, these data suggest that the cross-talk between insulin, IL-6 and leptin have an essential role in controlling food intake after exercise. In this case, it is possible that increases in IL-6 levels were counterbalanced by the reduction in insulin levels.</p><p>However, the present study has certain limitations. Exercise per se did not evoke any meaningful effect in terms of food intake; rather, it seemed to enhance the anorectic effect of exogenous leptin. Thus, the data presented herein may suggest but do not establish the mechanism by which long term exercise decreases leptin levels; whilst increases the response to leptin, contributing to its food-suppressive actions. Furthermore, settings of activation of AMPK or inactivation of mTOR were selected to induce changes in target protein phosphorylation, but not food intake. Such dissociation does not preclude a pharmacological rather than physiological effect of our data.</p><p>Increased responsiveness of leptin action in the hypothalamus, through modulation of the AMPK-mediated pathway by exercise, could be pathophysiologically important in the prevention of obesity. Recent studies have shown that modulation of leptin signaling through the AMPK pathway could be involved in the development of obesity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003856-Martin1">&#x0005b;61&#x0005d;</xref>. Taken together, these data indicate that the anti-obesity actions, induced by leptin, could be increased due to the more pronounced inhibition of the AMPK pathway observed after leptin infusion in the hypothalamus of both lean and diet-induced obesity rats after acute exercise. If the mechanism used by IL-6 to reduce food intake is AMPK-dependent, as our results suggest, the defective activation of AMPK in the hypothalamic neurons induced by exercise may increase the ability of leptin to reduce food intake.</p><p>In conclusion, exercise improved the AMPK and mTOR responses to leptin administration and contributed to appetite-suppressive actions. This increased dynamic responsiveness of the AMPK/mTOR pathway to leptin could provide information regarding the molecular mechanism underlying the biological sensitivity to leptin in exercise. Furthermore, these findings provide support to the hypothesis that AMPK and mTOR interact in the hypothalamus to control feeding in exercised rats, in an IL-6-dependent manner.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s4"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Antibodies and Chemicals</title><p>Reagents for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting were from Bio-Rad (Richmond, CA, USA).

The standard calibration curves for known amounts of ATP, ranging from 0.025 to 10.0 &#x000b5;mol/L, were linear (R&#x0003e;0.999) and could be described by the linear regression equation: <italic>y</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.4992&#x0002a;<italic>x</italic>&#x02212;0.0463 (<italic>n</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;4, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001, <italic>r</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.9997), in which <italic>y</italic> is the ATP concentration in micromoles and <italic>x</italic> is the chromatogram peak area.</p></sec><sec id="s4k"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>All numeric results are expressed as the means&#x000b1;SEM of the indicated number of experiments.
