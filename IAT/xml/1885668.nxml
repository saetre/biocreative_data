To investigate TREX2's biochemical and cellular properties, we show that endogenous TREX2 is expressed widely in mouse tissues and human cell lines. Unexpectedly, endogenous human TREX2 is predominantly expressed as a 30-kDa protein (not 26&#x02009;kDa, as previously believed), which is likely encoded by longer isoforms (TREX2<sup>L1</sup> and/or TREX2<sup>L2</sup>) that possess similar capacity for self-association, DNA binding and catalytic activity. Site-directed mutagenesis analysis shows that the three functional activities of TREX2 are distinct, yet integrated. Mutation of amino acids putatively important for homodimerization significantly impairs both DNA binding and exonuclease activity, while mutation of amino acids (except R163) in the DNA binding and exonuclease domains affects their corresponding activities. Interestingly, however, DNA-binding domain mutations do not impact catalytic activity, while exonuclease domain mutations diminish DNA binding. To understand TREX2 cellular properties, we find endogenous TREX2 is down regulated during G2/M and nuclear TREX2 displays a punctate staining pattern. Furthermore, TREX2 knockdown reduces cell proliferation. Taken together, our results suggest that TREX2 plays an important function during DNA metabolism and cellular proliferation.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>To a cell, faithful replication and accurate repair of genomic DNA are daunting tasks necessary for maintaining genomic integrity. Problems with replication fidelity or DNA repair may cause genomic mutations that could result in hereditary and sporadic human diseases such as cancer and accelerating aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3 B4">1&#x02013;4</xref>). To maintain genome integrity, cells have evolved a built-in DNA quality control network that consists of three highly coordinated components: DNA damage checkpoints, DNA repair and DNA replication. During the last decade, 3&#x02032;&#x02009;&#x02192;&#x02009;5&#x02032; exonuclease activity has been identified in DNA damage checkpoint proteins (hRad1 and hRad9) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>), DNA repair proteins (MRE11, WRN, APE1, APE2, XPF/ERCC1 and Dna2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7 B8 B9 B10 B11 B12">7&#x02013;12</xref>), DNA replication polymerases (pol&#x003b4;, pol&#x003b3; and pol&#x003b5;) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13 B14 B15">13&#x02013;15</xref>) and the well-known tumor suppressor p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). In yeast, homologs corresponding to these human genes (except p53) have also been identified, illustrating that this 3&#x02032;&#x02009;&#x02192;&#x02009;5&#x02032; exonuclease activity is evolutionarily conserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). Functional studies by gene inactivation in yeast and mouse models have demonstrated that mutation in any one of these genes directly leads to genomic instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). In fact, mutations in some of these genes such as MRE11, WRN, XPF, pol&#x003b3; and p53 cause a variety of pathologies including cancer and/or age-related diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18 B19 B20 B21 B22 B23">18&#x02013;23</xref>).</p><p>In 1999, two distinct mammalian nucleases, TREX1 (<underline>T</underline>hree prime <underline>r</underline>epair <underline>ex</underline>onuclease, also called DNase III) and TREX2, were found to account for the majority of exonuclease activity in mammalian cell extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). Highly purified endogenous and/or recombinant TREX1 and TREX2 showed a robust 3&#x02032;&#x02009;&#x02192;&#x02009;5&#x02032; exonuclease activity that favors DNA substrates with 3&#x02032; mismatches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25 B26 B27">25&#x02013;27</xref>). In addition, TREX1 enhances ligation efficiency in a pol&#x003b2;-mediated base excision repair assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>) and TREX2 may interact with pol&#x003b4; to increase replication accuracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). Protein sequence analysis shows that TREX1 and TREX2 share homology to the bacterial DNA polymerase III holoenzyme &#x003b5; subunit, which exhibits 3&#x02032;&#x02009;&#x02192;&#x02009;5&#x02032; exonuclease (proofreading) activity. In addition, X-ray structure of the TREX2 homodimer shows strong structural similarity to this subunit, providing direct evidence for the structural relationship between TREX2 functional domains and its biochemical activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). Thus, both TREX1 and TREX2 appear to be important for ensuring genomic integrity. However, <italic>Trex1</italic>-mutant mice do not exhibit a phenotype predicted for impaired editing of 3&#x02032; termini, since spontaneous mutations and cancer incidence remained unchanged as compared to controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). Unexpectedly, <italic>Trex1</italic>-mutant mice succumb to inflammatory myocarditis. This phenotype could be explained by the recent observation that TREX1 processes anomalous DNA structures to prevent an abnormal innate immune response that causes Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). Additionally, TREX1 exonuclease activity induces Granzyme A-mediated cell death in concert with the endonuclease NM23-H1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). At this time, the prediction about TREX2 function is based mainly on <italic>in vitro</italic> studies; therefore, the cellular and biological significance of TREX2 remains unclear.</p><p>For this study, we investigate the biochemical and cellular properties of TREX2. We find that TREX2 is widely expressed in a variety of tissues and cell lines, suggesting it has an important cellular function. In addition to the previously reported 26-kDa TREX2, we unexpectedly found that endogenous human TREX2 is predominantly expressed as a 30-kDa protein, thus leading to the isolation of two longer alternatively spliced isoforms that maintain the same basic biochemical function as the 26-kDa isoform. One of these isoforms, TREX2<sup>L1</sup>, is the predominant transcript for all samples tested (five cancer-derived human cell lines and kidney). Observation of a series of multiple and single amino acid mutations in the 26-kDa isoform shows that domains predicted to be important for homodimerization, DNA binding and exonuclease activity by X-ray structure have separate, yet integrated functions. We find that single amino acids predicted to be important for homodimerization do not measurably alter self-association, but greatly impair both DNA binding and catalytic activity. In contrast, single amino acid mutations predicted to be important for either DNA-binding or exonuclease activity abolish their corresponding activities. In addition, exonuclease domain mutations reduce DNA-binding activity while DNA-binding mutations do not affect catalytic activity. Our cellular studies show that endogenous TREX2 is distributed in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm, and that the nuclear fraction exhibits a punctate staining pattern. TREX2 is regulated during cell cycle, with lowest expression at the G2/M phase. Functional studies illustrate that depletion of endogenous TREX2 reduces cell proliferation. Taken together, our results suggest that TREX2 plays a key role in DNA metabolism.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plasmid construction, site-directed mutagenesis and cloning of TREX2 alternative splicing forms</title><p>GST-TREX2 fusion expression vectors were generated using the human TREX2 26-kDa isoform.

The biotinylated oligo (Biotin-5&#x02032;-GTA-TGA-GCT-GCA-GTT-CCT-CAG-CAT-3&#x02032;) was synthesized and diluted to a final concentration of 10&#x02009;nM by the running buffer (10&#x02009;mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 2.5&#x02009;mM EDTA, 2.5&#x02009;mM DTT, 250&#x02009;mM NaCl, 10% glycerol and 0.02% Triton X-100). The biotinylated ssDNA was immobilized onto the sensor chip SA (streptavidin chip, Biacore International AB, Sweden) to a final density of 100&#x02013;120 response units (RUs). One response unit corresponds to a surface density of 0.73&#x02009;pg/mm<sup>2</sup> DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>).

TREX2&#x02013;ssDNA-binding ability and binding kinetic analysis were performed using BIAevaluation4.1 global analysis software. To estimate the relative DNA-binding capacity of each mutant TREX2 compared to wild-type TREX2, the maximum DNA-binding value (at 60 second after injection) of each mutant protein is divided by the value of wild-type TREX2 and then multiplied by 100%.</p></sec><sec><title>Cell synchronization and cell cycle analysis by FACS</title><p>HeLa cells were grown to 60% confluency in a DMEM medium containing 10% calf serum and 1% GPS (2&#x02009;mM glutamine, 30&#x02009;&#x000b5;g penicillin/ml and 50&#x02009;&#x000b5;g streptomycin/ml).

Prior to the examination of endogenous TREX2, the specificity of these polyclonal antibodies was evaluated. Using direct- and anti-Flag immunoprecipitation-western blot analysis with mouse anti-TREX2 antibodies, a single protein band with a molecular mass of &#x0223c;28&#x02009;kDa was clearly detected in extracts prepared from HEK293 cells transiently transfected with the pCMV-Flag-TREX2 expression vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A, lane 6, 8 and 10). The same band was absent in either extracts prepared from empty vector-transfected HEK293 cells or the immunoprecipitation complex by pre-immune serum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A, lines 5, 7, and 9), indicating that anti-TREX2 antibodies specifically recognize recombinant Flag-TREX2 with nearly no background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A-c). We observed that the level of endogenous TREX2 in HEK293 cells, but not in other human cell lines (see below), is too low to be detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A, lanes 5 and 7). To verify the potential cross-reactivity of anti-TREX2 antibodies to TREX1 because of their peptide sequence homology, the HEK293-expressed Flag-TREX1 or Flag-TREX2 was subjected to western blot with anti-Flag, anti-TREX1 or anti-TREX2 antibodies. Anti-TREX2 antibodies specifically detect recombinant Flag-TREX2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B), but not Flag-TREX1 or other cellular proteins, showing that anti-TREX2 antibodies are highly specific to TREX2. </p><p>To detect endogenous TREX2, lysates prepared from mouse lung, liver, kidney, spleen, brain, testis and heart were separated by SDS-PAGE gel followed by western blot with anti-TREX2 antibodies. A protein band with the predicted molecular weight (&#x0223c;26&#x02009;kDa) was detected in all tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A), displaying an expression pattern similar to the transcription pattern using human tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). To extend this finding, extracts from human cell lines were examined by the same approach. To our surprise, a single major protein band with a molecular mass of 30&#x02009;kDa, rather than 26&#x02009;kDa, was detected in all human cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B) except HEK293 cells, in which no signal, neither 30- nor 26-kDa band, was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A lanes 1 and 2). To further verify this result, we did immunoprecipitation (IP)-western blot using mouse anti-TREX2 antibodies or pre-immune serum. Our results show that the 30-kDa protein band is immunoprecipitated specifically by anti-TREX2 antibodies, but not by pre-immune serum, indicating that the 30-kDa protein band is likely the endogenous human TREX2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C). Nevertheless, we observed a weak protein band corresponding to 26&#x02009;kDa in an anti-TREX2 immunoprecipitation-western blot while it is under detectable limits in a direct western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>C, lane 2 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B), suggesting that it is likely 26-kDa TREX2. To confirm the identity of the 30-kDa protein band, we introduced human TREX2 small interference RNA (siRNA) into HeLa cells. All three independent TREX2&#x02013;siRNA duplexes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>), but not the control siRNA, significantly reduced the 30-kDa protein band but not endogenous &#x003b2;-actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>D), thus providing strong evidence that the 30-kDa protein band is endogenous human TREX2. </p><p>There are two possibilities to account for endogenous human TREX2 migrating at 30&#x02009;kDa rather than 26&#x02009;kDa: (1) post-translational modification or (2) expression of bigger isoforms. To determine the nature of this 30-kDa protein, Flag-tagged and non-tagged TREX2 expressed in either HEK293 or HeLa cells were compared to endogenous human TREX2 by SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis followed by western blot using mouse anti-TREX2 antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>E). Non-tagged and Flag-tagged recombinant TREX2 migrate at their predicted molecular weights, 26 and 28&#x02009;kDa, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>E, lanes 1, 2 and lane 3 lower band), smaller than endogenous human TREX2 (30-kDa, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>E, lanes 3 and 4); thus, the slow migration of endogenous human TREX2 is not due to post-translational modification of the previously reported 26-kDa protein. To test whether the 30-kDa human TREX2 is a bigger isoform, we isolated longer TREX2 mRNA from a pool of 33 human tissues using primers corresponding to exons 15 and 16 of the reported TREX2 gene, AF319571 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). As a result, two longer spliced isoforms were identified, called TREX2<sup>L1</sup> and TREX2<sup>L2</sup>. TREX2<sup>L1</sup> is spliced by two exons, encoding a 279-amino-acid peptide identical to NP_542431 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A), while TREX2<sup>L2</sup> is novel and results from three spliced exons encoding a 278-amino-acid peptide, ABG43103 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A). Both of these alternatively spliced isoforms contain an extra peptide sequence (either 43 or 42 amino acids) fused to the N-terminus of the previously reported 26-kDa sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B). The predicted molecular weight of these two long isoforms is 30&#x02009;kDa, consistent with the molecular weight of endogenous human TREX2. Collectively, these long isoforms are predominantly expressed in human cells compared to the 26-kDa isoform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B) while the short isoform is predominantly expressed in mouse tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). </p><p>To further evaluate these long isoforms, we performed a semi-quantitative RT-PCR on mRNA isolated from five human cell lines (HeLa, LoVo, HCT116, PC3 and BG1) and one tissue (kidney) using primers specific to TREX2<sup>L1</sup> and TREX2<sup>L2</sup>. We also used primers located to the short isoform (thus, a control since all described isoforms contain this region). We find that TREX2<sup>L1</sup> is the predominant and possibly only transcript for all samples since TREX2<sup>L1</sup> levels are equal to that of the short isoform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>C). These transcripts were verified as being TREX2<sup>L1</sup> by re-amplification using an internal reverse primer along with the original forward primer and then by sequencing this re-amplification product. Since TREX2<sup>L2</sup> was not detected in these samples but present in a mixture of 33 human tissues, we anticipate that expression of TREX2<sup>L2</sup> is likely restricted to a subset of specific tissues or cell types.</p></sec><sec><title>Structure&#x02013;function analysis of TREX2 functional domains</title><p>Based on the peptide sequence alignment and the X-ray structural similarity between TREX2 and bacterial DNA polymerase III &#x003b5; subunit, TREX2 is proposed to possess three functional domains important for three distinct activities: homodimerization, DNA binding and exonuclease activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). In the same study, the amino acids critical for each functional activity have been proposed: arginine 163, 165 and 167 for DNA-binding ability; histidine 188 and aspartic acid 193 for exonuclease activity; and glutamic acid 29, arginine 55, lysine 59, aspartic acid 94, arginine 107 and glutamic acid 191 for dimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). To further map the functional contribution and the coordination of these three functional domains, we first investigate TREX2 (the 26-kDa isoform) with multiple mutations in each domain: homo-<bold><underline>d</underline></bold>imerization <bold><underline>d</underline></bold>efective (TREX2<sup>DD</sup>, E29A/K59A/D94A/R107A/E191A), DNA-<bold><underline>b</underline></bold>inding <bold><underline>d</underline></bold>efective (TREX2<sup>BD</sup>: R163A/R165A/R167A) and exonuclease <bold><underline>c</underline></bold>atalytic <bold><underline>d</underline></bold>efective (TREX2<sup>CD</sup>: H188A/D193A). We then investigate TREX2 with single amino acid changes for each domain using highly purified proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A and B). In addition, we investigate the three <italic>in vitro</italic> activities of the long TREX2 isoforms, TREX2<sup>L1</sup> and TREX2<sup>L2</sup>. </p><p>Homodimerization is measured by a GST pull-down assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C, D). We find TREX2, TREX2<sup>L1</sup> and TREX2<sup>L2</sup> are able to self-associate. In fact, self-association is not measurably diminished for any of the altered TREX2 proteins with the exception of TREX2<sup>DD</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>C and D). These results indicate that the combination of amino acids in the homodimerization domain (E29, K59, D94A, R107A and E191) is essential for TREX2 dimerization.</p><p>DNA binding is evaluated by a real-time DNA-binding assay based on surface plasmon resonance (SPR) that shows TREX2 directly binds to a single-strand DNA (ssDNA) substrate (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>) with a moderate binding affinity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A; KD&#x02009;=&#x02009;7.51&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;7</sup>, &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup>&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.72). TREX2<sup>L1</sup> and TREX2<sup>L2</sup> bind to this ssDNA substrate with &#x0223c;80 and &#x0223c;120% affinity relative to TREX2, respectively. In contrast, TREX2<sup>BD</sup> (R163A, R165A and R167A) is completely unable to bind to the ssDNA substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B and C) and differs from the previously published result, which showed that the same mutations reduced TREX2&#x02013;DNA-binding activity by &#x0223c;90-fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). This discrepancy likely reflects the different methodologies used in these studies, the former study is based on the steady-kinetic analysis by calculating the <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>/<italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> while our study evaluates the real-time TREX2&#x02013;DNA-binding kinetics by SPR technology. Using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), we find that TREX2<sup>BD</sup>, like TREX2, binds DNA substrate (data not shown), indicating that EMSA or <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>/<italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> calculation is less stringent than SPR analysis. To extend this finding, we further find single amino acid changes for two of these amino acids (R165A and R167A) impair DNA binding by &#x0223c;80%; however, changing the third amino acid (R163A) had only a marginal impact (&#x0223c;20%). Like TREX2<sup>BD</sup>, TREX2<sup>DD</sup> is completely unable to bind to the ssDNA substrate, and the single amino acid changes in this domain also severely impair substrate binding (&#x0003e;90% defective) suggesting that homodimerization is essential for the TREX2&#x02013;DNA substrate interaction. Unexpectedly, TREX2<sup>CD</sup> is also severely impaired (&#x0223c;90%) while single amino acid changes are moderately impaired (&#x0223c;60%) for substrate binding indicating that H188 and D193 are not only essential for catalytic activity, but also important for DNA binding. </p><p>Exonuclease activity is evaluated by an <italic>in vitro</italic> exonuclease assay as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). TREX2, TREX2<sup>L1</sup> and TREX2<sup>L2</sup> exhibit the same level of catalytic activity while TREX2<sup>CD</sup> and TREX2 with single amino acid changes in this domain (H188A or D193A) are completely defective for exonuclease catalytic activity even at high protein concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A, B), consistent with previous results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>). Like TREX2<sup>CD</sup>, TREX2<sup>DD</sup> possesses no catalytic activity even at high protein concentrations and changing most of the amino acids in this domain greatly reduces catalytic activity (R55A, K59A and D94A&#x02014;completely ablate activity; E29A and R107A&#x02014;severely diminish activity; and E191A&#x02014;moderately diminishes activity) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>C, D). Interestingly, TREX2<sup>BD</sup> displays moderately reduced catalytic activity compared to TREX2, but the single amino acid changes do not diminish activity. </p></sec><sec><title>Cellular characteristics of endogenous TREX2</title><p>Endogenous TREX2 was investigated for subcellular localization, cell cycle distribution and RNAi knockdown. To determine TREX2 subcellular localization, HeLa cells were immunostained using mouse anti-TREX2 antibodies. We find endogenous human TREX2 is localized in both the nucleus and cytoplasm. Interestingly, nuclear TREX2 displays a punctuate staining pattern with &#x0223c;3&#x02013;5 foci/cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A), a common characteristic shared by proteins participating in DNA damage checkpoints, DNA repair and replication. To investigate whether endogenous TREX2 expression is regulated during the cell cycle, HeLa cells were synchronized at G1/S by double-thymidine block (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>), as confirmed by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B). Cells form each phase of the cell cycle were collected and cell lysates were analyzed by western blot using mouse anti-hTREX2 antibodies. Our results show that endogenous TREX2 levels are regulated through the cell cycle with the lowest expression level in G2/M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>C), indicating that TREX2 plays a unique function in specific cell phases such as G1/S and S. RNAi knockdown was used to determine the impact loss-of-TREX2 function has on cell proliferation. The depletion of endogenous TREX2 in HeLa cells significantly reduces cell proliferation (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.012) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>D). Taken together, these results suggest that TREX2 plays an important role in regulating cell proliferation. </p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Here, we investigate the cellular and biochemical properties of the 3&#x02032;&#x02009;&#x02192;&#x02009;5&#x02032; exonuclease, TREX2. We find that TREX2 is commonly expressed in a wide range of mouse tissues and human cell lines and have identified at least three TREX2 isoforms generated by alternative splicing that include a 26-kDa isoform and two 30-kDa isoforms. These isoforms function equally well for homodimerization, DNA binding and exonuclease activity. For the 26-kDa isoform, we find that both DNA binding and catalytic activity depend on efficient self-association while DNA binding and exonuclease activities may be partly separated from each other. These activities are likely important for genome metabolism as supported by our observations that TREX2 forms nuclear foci, is cell cycle regulated and important for cellular proliferation.</p><p>We did not expect to find TREX2 to be predominately expressed as a 30-kDa protein rather than the 26-kDa protein in human cells. We provide five lines of evidence that support this 30-kDa protein is TREX2. First, the 30-kDa protein band is not endogenous TREX1 (&#x0223c;33&#x02009;kDa) non-specifically recognized by anti-TREX2 antibodies because no cross-reactivity of anti-TREX2 antibodies against TREX1 is detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>B). Second, the 30-kDa protein band is clearly detected as a single major band in both direct- and immunoprecipitation-western blot by using anti-TREX2 antibodies, but not pre-immune serum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>B and C). Third, the 30-kDa protein band is specifically knocked down by three independent human TREX2&#x02013;siRNA duplexes, but not by a control siRNA duplex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>D). Fourth, 26-kDa TREX2 is not modified to result in a 30-kDa protein band since neither Flag-tagged nor non-tagged 26-kDa TREX2 migrates at 30-kDa when transfected into human cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>E). Fifth, two alternatively spliced isoforms, TREX2<sup>L1</sup> and TREX2<sup>L2</sup>, were isolated, and these isoforms code for proteins predicted to be &#x0223c;30 kDa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). In addition, these long isoforms are completely functional for self-association, DNA binding and exonuclease activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4 F5 F6">Figure 4&#x02013;6</xref>). Taken together, our results support that the predominantly expressed endogenous 30-kDa protein is endogenous human TREX2. Because TREX2<sup>L1</sup> and TREX2<sup>L2</sup> were isolated based on an mRNA pool of 33 human tissues, we cannot conclude whether these isoforms display different tissue expression patterns at this time since this will require further investigation by using antibodies that specifically recognizing the 30-amino-acid peptide at the N-terminus. Unlike human TREX2, endogenous mouse TREX2 is predominantly detected as the 26-kDa isoform. Interestingly, a &#x0223c;30-kDa protein band was also observed in mouse kidney and testis, but not in other tissues, co-existing with 26-kDa TREX2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A), suggesting multiple TREX2 isoforms exist in mouse tissues as well.</p><p>The X-ray structure and amino acid conservation predict three domains for TREX2 that are important for homodimerization, DNA binding and exonuclease activity. We have developed three assays to evaluate each activity for a variety of mutants designed to disrupt only one domain. For the homodimerization domain, we find that the self-association is defective only when TREX2 contains five mutations. This highly altered protein is also severely defective for DNA binding and catalytic activities. Therefore, TREX2 was altered for only single amino acids within this domain and these TREX2 mutants are not obviously defective for self-association, but are severely defective for both DNA binding and catalytic activities demonstrating the importance for optimal self-association. Consistent with this finding, mutation of TREX1 R114 (equivalent to TREX2 R107) identified from Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome patients impairs catalytic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). For the DNA-binding domain, TREX2 with three mutations has no observable impact on self-association but severely disrupts both DNA binding and catalytic activity. TREX2 with single amino acid mutations in this domain shows that two of these amino acids (R165 and R167) are critical for fully efficient DNA binding each displaying an &#x0223c;80% decline; however, both mutants exhibit strong exonuclease activity. Thus, efficient exonuclease activity does not require efficient DNA binding, at least <italic>in vitro</italic>. Contrary to the X-ray structural prediction, mutation of R163 barely affects DNA binding even though this amino acid may be required for fully optimal binding. For the exonuclease domain, TREX2 with two mutations has no impact on self-association but severely disrupts its predicted activity as shown previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>) and also impairs DNA binding by &#x0223c;90%. TREX2 with single amino acid mutations in this domain show that each amino acid is critical for catalytic activity and important for fully efficient DNA binding since each mutant exhibits no catalytic activity and &#x0223c;60% reduction in DNA binding. Thus, amino acids essential for catalytic function are also important for efficient DNA binding. The genetic screen for TREX2 SNPs has led to the identification of S39F, R137 and R156L in prostate cancer clinical samples, but these mutations do not alter TREX2 <italic>in vitro</italic> exonuclease activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). It would be interesting to know whether DNA-binding activity or homodimer formation was affected by the mutation of S39F, R137 and R156L, thus altering the cellular function of TREX2.</p><p>TREX2 exhibits cellular characteristics that suggest its function supports genome integrity and cellular proliferation. We find that TREX2 forms nuclear foci and TREX2 levels are regulated during the cell cycle with the lowest expression during G2/M phase. Similarly, the other closely related 3&#x02032;&#x02192;5&#x02032; exonuclease, TREX1, is also cell cycle regulated, with the highest expression level in S-phase and the lowest in M phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>). In accordance with this observation, TREX2 has been reported to associate with replication proteins that include pol&#x003b4; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>) and the virus replication machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>) suggesting a role during DNA replication. However, the exact role of TREX2 in DNA replication remains to be investigated.</p><p>In summary, we have characterized the biochemical and cellular characteristics of TREX2. We find that TREX2 is expressed in most tissues and cells, and endogenous human TREX2 is dominantly expressed as a 30-kDa protein, likely encoded by either TREX2<sup>L1</sup> and/or TREX2<sup>L2</sup>. TREX2 forms nuclear foci and its levels are cell cycle regulated. TREX2 possesses at least three basic biochemical functions: homodimerization, DNA binding and enzymatic activity, and these functions are co-dependent, in particular, fully efficient homodimerization seems to be required for both DNA binding and exonuclease activity, and the exonuclease domain seems to be required for fully efficient DNA binding. Even though these domains are co-dependent, the DNA catalytic activity does not require fully efficient DNA binding by our <italic>in vitro</italic> assays. Finally, cellular studies show that TREX2 is important for cell proliferation. Collectively, our results suggest that TREX2 plays an important role in DNA metabolism and cell proliferation.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We thank Drs Hai Rao, Dave Sharp, Tom Boyer, Yousin Suh, Jan Vijg and Arlan Richardson for critical comments and Dr Eileen Lafer for helping with the Biacore results.

Human TREX2, located on chromosome X, contains 16 exons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>), of which only exons 15 and 16 are shown. TREX2<sup>L1</sup> (NP_542431) is a spliced product of exons 15 and 16. TREX2<sup>L2</sup> is a novel spliced product of exons 15, 15b and 16. The nucleotide sequence for TREX2<sup>L2</sup> has been deposited in the GenBank database under accession number DQ650792. The amino acid sequence of TREX2<sup>L2</sup> can be accessed through NCBI Protein Database under NCBI access number ABG43103. Oval indicates the predicated promoter region.

As a control, hTX2short (black half arrow in the red exon) and hTX2R were used to amplify the product common to all isoforms (lower panel). These products were re-amplified with the same forward primer and a new internal primer, hTX2Ri (green half arrow in the red exon). This TREX2<sup>L1</sup> product was sequenced to verify the results. We used hTX2L2F (half arrow in the orange exon) and hTX2R in our attempt to amplify the TREX2<sup>L2</sup> isoform; however, no product was seen.
