They are important for maintaining the integrity of chromosomes and this function is mediated through a number of protein factors. In <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, Cdc13p binds to telomeres and affects telomere maintenance, telomere position effects and cell cycle progression through G<sub>2</sub>/M phase. We identified four genes encoding Pol1p, Sir4p, Zds2p and Imp4p that interact with amino acids 1&#x02013;252 of Cdc13p using a yeast two-hybrid screening system. Interactions of these four proteins with Cdc13p were through direct protein&#x02013;protein interactions as judged by <italic>in vitro</italic> pull-down assays. Direct protein&#x02013;protein interactions were also observed between Pol1p&#x02013;Imp4p, Pol1p&#x02013;Sir4p and Sir4p&#x02013;Zds2p, whereas no interaction was detected between Imp4p&#x02013;Sir4p and Zds2p&#x02013;Imp4p, suggesting that protein interactions were specific in the complex. Pol1p was shown to interact with Cdc13p. Here we show that Zds2p and Imp4p also form a stable complex with Cdc13p in yeast cells, because Zds2p and Imp4p co-immunoprecipitate with Cdc13p, whereas Sir4p does not. The function of the N-terminal 1&#x02013;252 region of Cdc13p was also analyzed. Expressing Cdc13(252&#x02013;924)p, which lacks amino acids 1&#x02013;252 of Cdc13p, causes defects in progressive cell growth and eventually arrested in the G<sub>2</sub>/M phase of the cell cycle. These growth defects were not caused by progressive shortening of telomeres because telomeres in these cells were long. Point mutants in the amino acids 1&#x02013;252 region of Cdc13p that reduced the interaction between Cdc13p and its binding proteins resulted in varying level of defects in cell growth and telomeres. These results indicate that the interactions between Cdc13(1&#x02013;252)p and its binding proteins are important for the function of Cdc13p in telomere regulation and cell growth. Together, our results provide evidence for the formation of a Cdc13p-mediated telosome complex through its N-terminal region that is involved in telomere maintenance, telomere length regulation and cell growth control.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Cdc13p is a single-stranded TG<sub>1&#x02013;3</sub> binding protein that interacts with telomeres in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh203c1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh203c5">5</xref>). It binds specifically to single-stranded TG<sub>1&#x02013;3</sub> DNA, a tailed duplex DNA molecule with single-stranded TG<sub>1&#x02013;3</sub> tail, or a quadruplex DNA formed by TG<sub>1&#x02013;3</sub> sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh203c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh203c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh203c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh203c7">7</xref>). <italic>CDC13</italic> is an essential gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh203c8">8</xref>). It is involved in cell cycle control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh203c8">8</xref>), since a temperature-sensitive allele, <italic>cdc13-1</italic> (a Pro371&#x02192;Ser change), causes cell arrest in the G<sub>2</sub>/M phase of the cell cycle at non-permissive temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh203c8">8</xref>). This cell cycle control appears to be dependent on the presence of a single-stranded TG<sub>1&#x02013;3</sub> tail since masking its presence rescues cell cycle arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh203c9">9</xref>). The gene product of <italic>RAD9</italic>, which is involved in surveying the integrity of chromosomes, also plays an essential role in cell cycle control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh203c10">10</xref>). Cdc13p may enable Rad9p to differentiate whether the ends of a linear DNA are telomeres or broken ends by binding to telomeres. At least part of the cell cycle control function contributed by Cdc13p is through the interaction with Stn1p and Ten1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh203c11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh203c13">13</xref>). It appears that these two genes act together in maintaining telomere function because telomere defects caused by <italic>STN1</italic> or <italic>TEN1</italic> mutation are similar to <italic>CDC13</italic> mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh203c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh203c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh203c14">14</xref>).</p><p>Cdc13p is also involved in regulating the length of telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh203c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh203c15">15</xref>). A mutation allele of <italic>CDC13</italic>, <italic>cdc13-2</italic> (a Glu252&#x02192;Lys change), brings about a gradual loss of telomere length whereas a truncated form of <italic>CDC13</italic>, <italic>cdc13-5</italic> (an N-terminal amino acids 1&#x02013;694 fragment of Cdc13p), has long telomeres. Genetic and physical interactions were also observed between <italic>CDC13</italic> and <italic>EST1</italic>, and mutation in <italic>EST1</italic> caused a gradual loss of telomere length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh203c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh203c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh203c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh203c17">17</xref>). Est1p is associated with the RNA component of telomerase and is bound to single-stranded telomeric DNA <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh203c18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh203c21">21</xref>). Cdc13p might cooperate with Est1p to recruit telomerase to telomeres or activate telomere-bound telomerase for its replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh203c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh203c22">22</xref>). Moreover, it might promote C<sub>1&#x02013;3</sub>A DNA synthesis through its interaction with the catalytic subunit of polymerase &#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh203c17">17</xref>).</p><p><italic>CDC13</italic> encodes a 924 amino acid protein with a predicted molecular mass of 104 895 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh203c8">8</xref>). The DNA-binding region of Cdc13p is within the polypeptide, comprising amino acids 497&#x02013;693 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh203c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh203c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh203c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh203c24">24</xref>). A region comprising amino acids 190&#x02013;340 has been reported to be involved in telomerase recruitment, probably through interaction with Est1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh203c14">14</xref>). The Cdc13p fragment from amino acid 252 to 924, which contains both the telomere-binding region and Stn1p-interacting region, are required to maintain cell viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh203c12">12</xref>). In the present work we show that the N-terminal region comprising amino acids 1&#x02013;252 of Cdc13p interacts with Pol1p, Sir4p, Zds2p and Imp4p. Moreover, <italic>CDC13</italic>-deleted yeast cells expressing Cdc13p lacking the N-terminal 1&#x02013;252 amino acids region or Cdc13p with point mutations in this region caused defects in progressive cell growth and in cell cycle control. These cells also have defects in telomere length regulation. Thus, we conclude that the N-terminal region of Cdc13p is involved in telomere maintenance, telomere length regulation and cell growth control through its interaction with its binding proteins.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plasmids</title><p><italic>Escherichia coli</italic> DH5&#x003b1; was used as the host for plasmid construction and propagation.

Nucleotide dITP was added to increase the mutation frequency. The PCR amplified DNA fragment was mixed with EcoRI and XhoI digested pEG202 and transformed into YEM1&#x003b1;/pJG-IMP4(38&#x02013;290), YEM1&#x003b1;/pJG-SIR4(1143&#x02013;1358), YEM1&#x003b1;/pJG-ZDS2(553&#x02013;786) or YEM1&#x003b1;/pJG-POL1(47&#x02013;560).

The telomeric DNA-binding region was mapped to a region comprising amino acids 497&#x02013;693 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh203c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh203c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh203c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh203c24">24</xref>). Moreover, a region, comprising amino acids 190&#x02013;340 has been reported to be involved in telomerase recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh203c14">14</xref>). The function of the N-terminal region of Cdc13p is less clear. To understand the function of this region in Cdc13p, we conducted yeast two-hybrid screening using Cdc13(1&#x02013;252)p as the bait to search for proteins that interact with it. Cdc13(1&#x02013;252)p was fused to the LexA DNA-binding domain and used as the bait in a yeast two-hybrid system to identify its interacting proteins. After screening a total of &#x0223c;650&#x02009;000 transformants, we identified four clones that interacted strongly with Cdc13(1&#x02013;252)p (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh203f1">1</xref>A). DNA sequence analysis revealed that these four clones encoded Pol1(47&#x02013;560)p, Imp4(28&#x02013;290)p, Zds2(553&#x02013;786)p and Sir4(1143&#x02013;1358)p fused in-frame to the B42 activation domain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh203f1">1</xref>B). Pol1p is the catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase &#x003b1;. Previous genetic studies and yeast two-hybrid analyses have indicated an interaction between Cdc13p and Pol1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh203c17">17</xref>). Imp4p is a component of the U3 small nucleolar ribonucleoprotein (snoRNP) that is essential for pre-18S rRNA processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh203c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh203c28">28</xref>). Zds2p has roles in a variety of cellular functions, including signal transduction, translation, chromatin organization, cell cycle regulation, mating type cassettes and rDNA silencing, and may also affect the lifespan of yeast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh203c29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh203c34">34</xref>). Sir4p forms a complex with Sir3p that participates in mating type cassettes and telomere silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh203c35">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh203c37">37</xref>). Two-hybrid analyses indicate that Zds2p also interacts with Sir4p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh203c33">33</xref>). It is interesting to note that in the absence of galactose induction, the Sir4p construct gave Leu<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>-positive cells in the presence of Cdc13(1&#x02013;252)p (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh203f1">1</xref>A). This is probably due to leaky repression of the <italic>GAL1</italic> promoter by glucose. Expression of a B42 activation domain&#x02013;Sir4(1143&#x02013;1358)p fusion protein appears to have a negative effect on cell growth (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh203f1">1</xref>A). It is unclear how this fusion protein causes such an effect. However, since the C-terminus of Sir4p also interacts with other proteins that are important for cell growth, expression of excess amount of the C-terminal portion of Sir4p might titrate away these proteins from their normal functions.</p><p>To further narrow down the region within Cdc13p interacting with these proteins, we generated a series of deletion mutants of Cdc13(1&#x02013;252)p. Two-hybrid assays with various fragments of Cdc13p were employed to test if these proteins interact with smaller regions of Cdc13(1&#x02013;252)p. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh203f1">1</xref>C, only the fragment(s) containing Cdc13(1&#x02013;252)p interacted with Imp4(28&#x02013;290)p, Sir4(1143&#x02013;1358)p and Pol1(47&#x02013;560)p, whereas fragment Cdc13(78&#x02013;163)p is sufficient to interact with Zds2(553&#x02013;786)p. Cdc13p lacking the N-terminal 252 amino acid region of the protein, Cdc13(252&#x02013;924)p, did not interact with these four proteins (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh203f1">1</xref>C). These results indicate that the region of interaction of Cdc13p with these four proteins is limited to the N-terminal sequence.</p></sec><sec><title>Interactions among Cdc13p, Pol1p, Imp4p, Sir4p and Zds2p <italic>in vitro</italic></title><p>Yeast two-hybrid analyses detect not only direct protein&#x02013;protein interactions but also interactions mediated through other factors. Therefore, pull-down assays were carried out to further analyze the nature of the interaction between Cdc13p and its binding proteins. We first fused Pol1(47&#x02013;412)p to MBP and the recombinant protein was allowed to bind amylose resin. Then, bacterial extracts containing Cdc13(1&#x02013;252)p fused to GST were passed through the resin. Retention of Cdc13(1&#x02013;252)p fusion protein was detected by western blotting analysis using polyclonal antibodies against GST&#x02013;Cdc13(1&#x02013;252)p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh203c12">12</xref>). The results shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh203f2">2</xref>A indicate that Cdc13(1&#x02013;252)p was associated with Pol1(47&#x02013;412)p. Similar experiments were conducted to test the interactions between Cdc13(1&#x02013;252)p and 6&#x000d7;His-tagged Imp4p, Sir4(1143&#x02013;1358)p and Zds2(553&#x02013;786)p (see Materials and Methods for details). The results shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh203f2">2</xref>B&#x02013;D indicate that these three proteins were able to interact physically with Cdc13(1&#x02013;252)p in the absence of other yeast proteins. Faint bands were also detected in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh203f2">2</xref>B (lanes 2 and 4) in samples with GST&#x02013;CDC13(1&#x02013;252)p; these bands are non-specific cross-hybridization with the anti-6&#x000d7;His antibody. It appears that 6&#x000d7;His&#x02013;Sir4p and 6&#x000d7;His&#x02013;Zds2p have weak affinity for GST protein under our experimental conditions because we also detected weak signals corresponding to the positions of 6&#x000d7;His&#x02013;Sir4p and 6&#x000d7;His&#x02013;Zds2p in the GST controls in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh203f2">2</xref>C and D (lane 2). However, since samples with Cdc13(1&#x02013;252)p reproducibly gave stronger signals than that of GST controls (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh203f2">2</xref>C and D, lanes 2 and 4), we concluded that Cdc13(1&#x02013;252)p interacted with Sir4p and Zds2p. Together, our results indicate that Cdc13(1&#x02013;252)p interacts directly with Pol1(47&#x02013;412)p, Imp4p, Sir4(1143&#x02013;1358)p and Zds2(553&#x02013;786)p.</p><p>We next asked whether these Cdc13-binding proteins can interact with each other using similar <italic>in vitro</italic> pull-down assays.

Here we apply a similar approach to determine if the interactions between fragments of Cdc13p and Imp4p, Zds2p and Sir4p reflect an <italic>in vivo</italic> association of full-length proteins. To determine the interaction between Cdc13p and Zds2p, total cell extracts were prepared from cells carrying endogenous copies of both genes expressed from their own promoters. Polyclonal anti-GST&#x02013;Cdc13(451&#x02013;693)p antibodies were used to immunoprecipitate Cdc13p. The precipitate was analyzed by western blotting using polyclonal anti-6&#x000d7;His&#x02013;Zds2(553&#x02013;786)p antibodies (Chen and Lin, unpublished results). Zds2p, with a predicted mass of 103 732, was readily detected in the anti-Cdc13p immunoprecipitate (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh203f4">4</xref>A). In the experiment to determine the interaction between Cdc13p and Imp4p, cell extracts were prepared from <italic>imp4</italic>&#x00394; cells that expressed Imp4p with a triple HA tag on the C-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh203c25">25</xref>). Polyclonal anti-GST&#x02013;Cdc13(451&#x02013;693)p antibodies were used to immunoprecipitate Cdc13p. The precipitate was analyzed by western blotting using monoclonal anti-HA antibody. The results shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh203f4">4</xref>B showed that Imp4p was present in the anti-Cdc13p immunoprecipitate. Together, we conclude that full-length Cdc13p interacts with Zds2p and Imp4p <italic>in vivo</italic>. So far, we have been unable to detect Sir4p in the anti-Cdc13p immunoprecipitate (Chen and Lin, data not shown). Consequently, we do not know whether the interaction detected between Cdc13p and Sir4p fragments reflects the interaction of full-length proteins <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Loss of Cdc13(1&#x02013;252)p affects cell growth and telomere maintenance</title><p>It is known that Cdc13p is essential for cell viability. We have shown that Cdc13(451&#x02013;693)p containing the telomere-binding region of Cdc13p could not complement the growth arrest caused by <italic>cdc13-1</italic> or <italic>cdc13</italic>-null mutations and, therefore, that the telomere-binding activity alone was not sufficient to account for the essentiality of Cdc13p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh203c12">12</xref>). Instead, we showed that Cdc13(252&#x02013;924)p complemented the null allele of <italic>cdc13</italic> using a plasmid loss experiment. The effect on yeast cells of a lack of Cdc13(1&#x02013;252)p was analyzed further. Here, the <italic>cdc13</italic>&#x00394;::<italic>HIS3</italic> strain YJL501 requires a <italic>CDC13</italic>-bearing plasmid (YEP24-CDC13, with a <italic>URA3</italic> marker) to grow. If a second plasmid introduced into yeast expresses functional <italic>CDC13</italic>, then YJL501 no longer requires plasmid YEP24-CDC13 for viability. Growth on 5-FOA is used to monitor loss of YEP24-CDC13. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh203f5">5</xref>A, 5-FOA-resistant cells were observed in YJL501 transformed with a plasmid expressing Cdc13p. Similarly, 5-FOA-resistant cells were observed in YJL501 cells expressing Cdc13(252&#x02013;924)p, although this rescue was &#x0223c;10&#x02013;100 times less efficient than that of Cdc13p. However, transformation of YJL501 with plasmid vector pTHA-NLS or plasmids expressing other fragments of <italic>CDC13</italic> did not yield any 5-FOA-resistant cells (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh203c12">12</xref>). To eliminate the possibility that this effect was due to recombination, the same experiments were carried out in <italic>rad52</italic>&#x00394; cells that were defective in recombination. Identical results were obtained (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh203f5">5</xref>B), indicating that survival was not due to a recombination effect.</p><p>We further analyzed the cell growth and telomere phenotypes. <italic>cdc13</italic>&#x00394;/Cdc13(252&#x02013;924)p colonies in 5-FOA plates were generally smaller than <italic>cdc13</italic>&#x00394;/Cdc13p cells, <italic>cdc13</italic>&#x00394;/Cdc13(252&#x02013;924)p cells produced smaller colonies in the first re-streak and did not form colonies at the third re-streak (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh203f6">6</xref>A). The results suggest that there is a growth defect in these cells. Therefore, FACS analysis was conducted to investigate whether this phenotype is related to the cell cycle defect. The results shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh203f6">6</xref>B indicate that the proportion of <italic>cdc13</italic>&#x00394;/Cdc13(252&#x02013;924)p cells in G<sub>2</sub>/M stage was significantly higher than that of <italic>cdc13</italic>&#x00394;/Cdc13p cells. The budding index was also determined. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh203f6">6</xref>C, the proportion of large bud and two equal-sized cells (G<sub>2</sub>/M) increased from 33&#x00025; in <italic>cdc13</italic>&#x00394;/Cdc13p cells to 58&#x00025; in <italic>cdc13</italic>&#x00394;/Cdc13(252&#x02013;924)p cells. Thus, <italic>cdc13</italic>&#x00394;/Cdc13(252&#x02013;924)p cells have a cell cycle defect in G<sub>2</sub>/M phase. This cell cycle defect was dependent on <italic>RAD9</italic>, since <italic>cdc13</italic>&#x00394;/Cdc13(252&#x02013;924)p cells failed to arrest at G<sub>2</sub>/M phase in the absence of <italic>RAD9</italic> (data not shown).</p><p>In <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic>, middle repetitive sequences known as Y&#x02032; elements are found in the subtelomeric regions of most chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh203c38">38</xref>). As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh203f6">6</xref>D (lanes 1 and 2), in <italic>cdc13</italic>&#x00394;/Cdc13p cells XhoI digestion produces an &#x0223c;1.3 kb fragment from the ends of Y&#x02032;-bearing chromosomes that contains &#x0223c;950 bp of Y&#x02032; and a terminal tract of &#x0223c;350 bp of TG<sub>1&#x02013;3</sub>/C<sub>1&#x02013;3</sub>A DNA. However, the length of Y&#x02032;-bearing telomeres in <italic>cdc13</italic>&#x00394;/Cdc13(252&#x02013;924)p cells appeared to be longer and more heterogeneous than those in <italic>cdc13</italic>&#x00394;/Cdc13p cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh203f6">6</xref>D, lanes 3 and 4). This telomere length phenotype was not progressive, as increased cell divisions did not further affect its length (data not shown). The growth defect observed in <italic>cdc13</italic>&#x00394;/Cdc13(252&#x02013;924)p cells does not appear to be caused by gradual telomere shortening. The single-stranded telomeric tail did not appear to be altered in <italic>cdc13</italic>&#x00394;/Cdc13(252&#x02013;924)p cells, as judged by Southern hybridization under non-denaturing conditions (data not shown). Yeast <italic>CDC13</italic>/Cdc13(252&#x02013;924)p cells that expressed Cdc13(252&#x02013;924)p with wild-type chromosomal <italic>CDC13</italic> did not have a growth defect, a cell cycle delay and long telomeres, suggesting that the phenotype observed in <italic>cdc13</italic>&#x00394;/Cdc13(252&#x02013;924)p cells is recessive (data not shown). Therefore, it is likely that the N-terminal region of Cdc13p plays a role in causing the phenotype and that the phenotype we observed in <italic>cdc13</italic>&#x00394;/Cdc13(252&#x02013;924)p cells is caused by loss of interactions between Cdc13(1&#x02013;252)p and its binding proteins.</p></sec><sec><title>Identification of Cdc13p mutations that reduce the interaction with its binding proteins</title><p>To identify point mutations in Cdc13p that disrupted the interaction between Cdc13(1&#x02013;252)p and Pol1(47&#x02013;412)p, Imp4p, Sir4(1143&#x02013;1358)p or Zds2(553&#x02013;786)p, we used PCR to mutagenize Cdc13(1&#x02013;252)p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh203c39">39</xref>). The mutagenized fragments were then assessed for their ability to interact with Pol1(47&#x02013;412)p, Imp4p, Sir4(1143&#x02013;1358)p and Zds2(553&#x02013;786)p in the two-hybrid assay. While screening a total of &#x0223c;1200 colonies from each pair of interactions, we isolated a total of 23 mutants that failed to interact with all four proteins and two mutants (<italic>cdc13-L1</italic> and <italic>cdc13-L2</italic>) that failed to interact with some of these four proteins. Since we are interested in analyzing the role of these interactions in telomere function, only <italic>cdc13-L1</italic> and <italic>cdc13-L2</italic> cells were picked for further analysis (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh203f7">7</xref>A). The <italic>cdc13-L1</italic> mutant failed to interact with Pol1p, Imp4p or Zds2p. Sequence analysis revealed three point mutations that generated three amino acid changes, D2G, L53Q and S134R, in <italic>cdc13-L1</italic>. Mutant <italic>cdc13-L2</italic> failed to interact with Imp4p and Sir4p while it maintained the interactions with Pol1p and Zds2p (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh203f7">7</xref>A). There were two point mutations that generated two amino acid differences, V18G and K129E, in <italic>cdc13-L2</italic>. These two mutants showed similar expression levels to that of wild-type protein by western blotting, suggesting that their defects were not due to a loss of protein stability (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh203f7">7</xref>B).</p><p>Similar to <italic>cdc13</italic>(252&#x02013;924), a plasmid loss assay indicated that mutant <italic>cdc13-L1</italic> could only partially complement a <italic>cdc1</italic>3 null mutation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh203f8">8</xref>A). The 5-FOA-resistant <italic>cdc13-L1</italic> cells also lost viability after two or three re-streaks, similarly to 5-FOA-resistant <italic>cdc13</italic>(252&#x02013;924) cells (data not shown). Telomere length analysis indicates that 5-FOA-resistant <italic>cdc13-L1</italic> cells have lengthened telomeres, although the telomere lengthening is not as great as in 5-FOA-resistant <italic>cdc13</italic>(252&#x02013;924) cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh203f8">8</xref>B).

Together, several conclusions can be drawn from these analyses. First, the interaction between Cdc13p and Sir4p does not affect cell growth. Second, the interaction between Cdc13p and Pol1p and/or Cdc13p and Zds2p affects the essential function of <italic>CDC13</italic> and negatively modulates telomere length. Finally, the interaction of Cdc13p with Imp4p or Sir4p is not required for the essential function of Cdc13p, but positively modulates telomere length.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Our analyses of <italic>cdc13</italic>&#x00394;/Cdc13(252&#x02013;924)p cells revealed several interesting features of Cdc13(1&#x02013;252)p in telomere function. Even though Cdc13(252&#x02013;924)p is sufficient to maintain immediate cell growth, it cannot support the long-term survival of cells. Although this type of growth defect is a signature of mutants that show a gradual loss of telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh203c16">16</xref>), the telomeres in <italic>cdc13</italic>&#x00394;/Cdc13(252&#x02013;924)p cells are significantly longer than in wild-type cells and remain long when cell growth is affected. It appears that telomere shortening is not the reason for the growth defect in <italic>cdc13</italic>&#x00394;/Cdc13(252&#x02013;924)p cells. A similar conclusion was drawn for mammalian cells. In human cells which overexpress TRF2, a telomere-binding protein, the rate of telomere shortening is increased without an acceleration in the rate of senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh203c40">40</xref>). It was suggested that the alteration of telomere state is responsible for triggering cell growth arrest.</p><p>It is still unclear to us what the primary cause of the cell cycle arrest in <italic>cdc13</italic>&#x00394;/Cdc13(252&#x02013;924)p cells is. In <italic>pol1</italic> mutants that failed to interact with Cdc13p, cells do not show detectable growth defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh203c17">17</xref>). Thus, failure of the interaction between Cdc13p and Pol1p might not contribute to the growth phenotype. Even though similar lengthening phenotypes were observed in <italic>stn1</italic> and <italic>ten1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh203c11">11</xref>), it is unlikely that failed interactions between Cdc13p and these two proteins causes such telomere changes. The region of interaction between Cdc13p and Stn1p was mapped to amino acids 252&#x02013;924 of Cdc13p, since interactions between Cdc13p and these two proteins were normal in cells lacking the N-terminal 252 amino acids of Cd1c3p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh203c12">12</xref>). Since both Sir4p and Zds2p are not essential for cell survival, failed interactions between Cdc13p and these two proteins could not contribute to the defect in the cell cycle. We show in the <italic>cdc13-L2</italic> mutant that a failed interaction between Cdc13p and Imp4p does not cause the cell cycle defect, indicating that their interaction is not the cause of the cell cycle defect. Thus, any failed interaction between Cdc13p and individual interacting proteins cannot completely explain the cell cycle defect in <italic>cdc13</italic>&#x00394;/Cdc13(252&#x02013;924)p cells. Since all the mutants we isolated caused at least two failed interactions, we propose that the growth defect observed was the combined effect of failed interactions between Cdc13p and multiple proteins. Even though the mechanism of how Cdc13(1&#x02013;252)p affects telomere maintenance and the cell cycle remains to be tested, our results indicate that the N-terminal 1&#x02013;252 amino acids of Cdc13p affect multiple aspects of telomere function, including replication, cell cycle control and length maintenance.</p><p>During telomere replication, telomerase is involved in extending the G-rich strand of the telomere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh203c41">41</xref>). Subsequently, the C-rich strand should be synthesized by lagging strand synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh203c42">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh203c44">44</xref>). At least two DNA polymerases, &#x003b1; and &#x003b4;, were reported to be involved in telomere replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh203c43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh203c44">44</xref>). However, the molecular mechanism of how these polymerases mediate telomere replication is unclear. The telomeres in several <italic>pol1</italic> mutants are longer than in wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh203c45">45</xref>). In <italic>cdc13</italic> mutants, in which the interaction with Pol1p failed, the telomeres were long (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh203c17">17</xref>). Thus, the long telomeres observed in <italic>cdc13</italic>&#x00394;/Cdc13(252&#x02013;924)p and <italic>cdc13</italic>&#x00394;/Cdc13-L1p cells are probably due to loss of the interaction between Cdc13p and Pol1p. These results provide a clue as to how DNA polymerase &#x003b1; might mediate telomere replication; Cdc13p, a telomere-binding protein, might recruit DNA polymerase &#x003b1; to the telomere for C-rich strand synthesis and at the same time inhibit telomere extension by telomerase.</p><p>We have shown that the telomere-binding domain maps within amino acids 451&#x02013;693 of Cdc13p both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh203c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh203c12">12</xref>). We also showed that the N-terminal 1&#x02013;251 amino acids of Cdc13p did not bind to single-stranded TG<sub>1&#x02013;3</sub> DNA <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh203c12">12</xref>). However, using a one-hybrid system, Bourns <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh203c3">3</xref>) showed that the N-terminal 251 amino acids of Cdc13p interacts with the telomere. Given that Cdc13(1&#x02013;252)p interacts with Sir4p, binding of Cdc13(1&#x02013;252)p to the telomere depends on the presence of Sir3p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh203c3">3</xref>) and Sir4p interacts with both Sir3p and Rap1p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh203c46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh203c47">47</xref>), it is likely that this N-terminal 251 amino acid fragment of Cdc13p interacts indirectly with the telomere through its interaction with Sir4p in the one-hybrid system. The interaction between Cdc13p and Sir4p is probably transient or unstable, because we could not detect the interaction by co-immunoprecipitation analysis. It is also evident from the observation that the C-terminal region of Sir4p which interacts with Cdc13p and Zds2p also interacts with several other proteins, including Sir2p, Sir3p, Dot4p, Ubp3p, Zds1p, Rap1p, Hdf1, Dis1p and itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh203c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh203c34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh203c46">46</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh203c52">52</xref>). Sir4p may utilize its C-terminal region, which contains a lamin-like coiled-coil domain, to mediate its various interactions in yeast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh203c53">53</xref>). These proteins might form different complexes through the combination of different proteins in telomeres and work together for telomere maintenance. The function of the interaction between Cdc13p and Sir4p is still unclear to us. However, since Sir4p is required for telomere silencing and overexpressing Cdc13-1p affects telomere silencing at non-permissive temperatures, we speculate that the interaction might be important for telomere silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh203c1">1</xref>).</p><p>It has been shown that <italic>ZDS1</italic> and <italic>ZDS2</italic> have pleiotropic effects in a large number of assays, suggesting roles of these two genes in a variety of cell functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh203c29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh203c34">34</xref>). Deletion analysis indicates that the <italic>ZDS1</italic> mutation affects telomere silencing, whereas the <italic>ZDS2</italic> mutation does not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh203c34">34</xref>). Zds2p is implicated in telomere function because it interacts with Sir2p, Sir3p, Sir4p and Rap1p and its overexpression slightly affects telomere silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh203c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh203c34">34</xref>). Here we show an interaction between Cdc13p and Zds2p by both two-hybrid and biochemical criteria. Our results provide evidence that Zds2p is indeed a component of telomeres. It will be interesting to learn how the interaction between these two proteins affects telomere function.</p><p>snoRNP particles are known to function in the modification and processing of pre-rRNA. However, additional roles of these complexes have been reported. For example, the class of box H/ACA snoRNPs has been implicated in telomerase function in that the protein components bind the 3&#x02032;-terminal domain of telomerase RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh203c54">54</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh203c56">56</xref>). Mutations in the human H/ACA snoRNP dyskerin and telomerase RNA affect telomerase RNA accumulation and subsequently affect telomerease activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh203c57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh203c58">58</xref>). Clearly, box H/ACA snoRNPs have a role in telomere maintenance. Here we report another example of a different class of snoRNP, the box C/D snoRNPs, that might also be involved in telomere function. U3 snoRNP is a member of the box C/D class of snoRNAs which is essential for pre-18S rRNA processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh203c59">59</xref>). U3 snoRNP forms a large ribonucleoprotein complex containing over 20 proteins, including Imp4p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh203c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh203c28">28</xref>). The interaction between Cdc13p and Imp4p might imply a role of U3 snoRNP in telomere function. Imp4p contains a Brix domain that might be involved in binding to RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh203c60">60</xref>). The Brix domain has also been identified in several yeast proteins involved in RNA metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh203c60">60</xref>). Nucleic acids binding analysis also demonstrates that Imp4p is capable of binding to RNA and single-stranded DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh203c61">61</xref>). Imp4p might also utilize the Brix domain to interact with the single-stranded telomeric tail or to bind telomerase RNA. It will be interesting to learn how Imp4p affects telomere function.</p><p>From our results and genetic evidence provided by others we propose a model for formation of the telosome complex mediated by Cdc13p. Here, Cdc13p binds to the single-stranded tail of the telomere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh203c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh203c2">2</xref>) and cooperates with Est1p and telomerase for G-rich strand extension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh203c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh203c22">22</xref>). Cdc13p might also interact and recruit DNA polymerase &#x003b1; to the telomere for C-strand synthesis. The interaction between Cdc13p and Pol1p may negatively regulate telomerase extension so that the telomere would not be extended further, and DNA polymerase &#x003b1; will fill the single-stranded, G-rich DNA by initiating lagging strand synthesis. Genetic and biochemical evidence indicates that Cdc13p interacts with Stn1p and Ten1p for telomere length maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh203c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh203c13">13</xref>). We identify three additional protein factors that interact with Cdc13p, Imp4p, Sir4p and Zds2p. The interaction between Cdc13p and Sir4p and/or Zds2 might contribute to telomere silencing mediated by Cdc13p. Moreover, interaction of Cdc13p with Imp4p might modulate telomere length, even though the molecular mechanism is unclear. Nevertheless, Cdc13p appears to play a central role in the nucleation of telosome structures.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkh203f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Interaction of Cdc13(1&#x02013;252)p with Pol1(47&#x02013;560)p, Imp4(28&#x02013;290)p, Zds2(553&#x02013;786)p and Sir4(1143&#x02013;1358)p.
