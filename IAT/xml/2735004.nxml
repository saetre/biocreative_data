The pathophysiology of type 1 diabetes (T1DM) is the result of the destruction of the insulin-producing beta cells, and a promising treatment paradigm for T1DM is replacement of the missing beta cells with insulin-producing cells derived from embryonic or other stem cell sources. Many groups worldwide are currently working to develop methods to produce beta cells in vitro, however as yet there are no reports demonstrating fully functional cells appropriate for cell replacement therapy. A major hurdle has been achieving normal levels of insulin gene expression.</p><p>Although much is known about the control of insulin gene expression, DNA methylation of the insulin promoter and its relationship to gene expression has not been investigated.

In this study we have demonstrated that human insulin gene and mouse insulin2 gene expression are also controlled epigenetically by methylation of specific CpG sites in the promoter regions. In non-insulin expressing cells, some or all of these sites are methylated, whereas in insulin-expressing cells they are completely demethylated.</p><p>In general, DNA methylation has a suppressive effect on gene transcription. We show that this is also true of the human and mouse insulin promoters, where complete methylation suppressed reporter gene expression by 85&#x00025; and 79&#x00025;, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006953-g002">Figs. 2B and 2C</xref>). However, methylation of the individual sites in the mouse promoter revealed only one site, the CpG at position &#x02212;182, which significantly suppressed gene expression, and only by about 50&#x00025;. Paradoxically, methylation of the distal CpG at position &#x02212;414 significantly increased gene expression by 86&#x00025;. Since complete methylation suppresses insulin promoter activity, these observations imply that methylation-dependent control of insulin gene expression is indirect, probably involving a higher levels of DNA structure such as nucleotide positioning and chromatin compaction.</p><p>The CpG site at position &#x02212;182 in the mouse Ins2 promoter is located within a cyclic-adenosine monophosphate response element (CRE) which was previously shown to be involved in insulin gene expression. Previous studies have demonstrated that CRE methylation suppresses transcription of other genes, usually by direct inhibition of binding of the transcription factor CREB. Therefore, we investigated the effect of methylation on binding of beta cell factors to the CRE sequence in the mouse <italic>Ins2</italic> gene. In agreement with other groups, we found that the transcription factor ATF2 binds to the insulin promoter CRE and that overexpression of ATF2 increases insulin gene expression, whereas CREB overexpression actually suppresses the insulin promoter (data not shown). We also found that binding of both ATF2 and CREB to the insulin promoter CRE <italic>in vivo</italic> was inhibited by methylation. However, in contrast to other gene promoters, we found that methylation did not directly inhibit transcription factor binding to the CRE in the insulin promoter. Importantly, methylation increased the binding of the methylated DNA binding protein MeCP2. We believe that the binding of MeCP2 to the methylated CpG in the CRE site may compete with binding of other factors, thus contributing to the suppression of gene expression.</p><p>Yet the predominant suppressive effect of binding of MeCP2 to the insulin gene is probably not due to blocking of transcriptional activators since methylation of the CRE CpG alone results in only 50&#x00025; inhibition, but rather MeCP2 binding likely recruits histone deacetylases that maintain the chromatin in a compacted state. Wu and Gilbert <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006953-Wu1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref> showed long ago that the promoter of the rat insulin 2 gene exhibits tissue-specific sensitivity to DNase I, indicating a relaxed chromatin structure in this region in insulin-producing cells. More recently the Mirmira laboratory has provided a mechanism for this observation, showing that there is a beta cell-specific shift in nucleosome positioning in the insulin promoter, allowing the binding of the PDX-1 transcription factor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006953-Francis1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>, which recruits histone methylase to the promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006953-Francis2">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>, thus stabilizing the open chromatin structure and providing the opportunity for transcription. We speculate that an initiating event in this process is the beta cell-specific demethylation of the insulin locus resulting in the relaxation of the chromatin structure and repositioning of the nucleosomes.</p><p>Therefore, unlike other mechanisms controlling insulin activity, methylation is likely involved in the development of insulin-producing cells rather than in daily metabolic regulation. When one particular developmental model was examined, i.e. the transition of mouse embryonic stem cells to endodermal-like cells and then into an early pancreatic lineage <italic>in vitro</italic>, it appeared that there is a transition in the insulin promoter from full methylation to partial demethylation. However, decrease in methylation at specific sites occurs very late in the differentiation program and was incomplete in this model, even in the isolated Ngn3-EGFP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> pancreatic endocrine lineage cells. This indicates that demethylation is one of the very late steps in differentiation of insulin-producing cells. This may be one of the reasons that no one has yet been able to achieve efficient differentiation of functional insulin-producing cells <italic>in vitro</italic>. As yet, the precise mechanism of gene-specific DNA demethylation has not been unraveled. It may be a passive process involving replication in absence of maintenance DNA methylation. Alternatively, recent studies indicate that active DNA demethylation may occur and this pathway may involve interaction between cytosine deaminase and thymine-DNA glycosylase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006953-Abu1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006953-Morgan1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>. The developmental control of gene-specific DNA demethylation is the subject of ongoing investigations.</p><p>In conclusion, this study demonstrates that DNA methylation suppresses insulin gene expression and that the insulin gene promoter is specifically demethylated in insulin-producing cells. Methylation recruits MeCP2, and possibly other methylated DNA binding proteins, resulting in decreased binding of the transcriptional activators, ATF2 and CREB. Furthermore, demethylation of the insulin gene appears to be an important and potentially rate-limiting step in the differentiation of insulin-producing cells from embryonic stem cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>Animals used in this study received high quality animal care consistent with the Public Health Service Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and the Animal Welfare Act.

Corresponding secondary antibodies against each first antibody/immunoglobulin were either conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) or Texas red (Jackson Immuno-Research Laboratories, West Grove, PA). Stained samples were embedded in Vectashield (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and examined under an Olympus BX51 fluorescent microscope, equipped with a Pixera 600 CL cooled CCD camera (Olympus America, Melville, NY). A picture for each individual color was separately captured using Pixera Viewfinder 3.0 acquisition software (Pixera, Los Gatos, CA). Cell percentages were determined by manual counting of at least six randomly chosen fields.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Cell culture</title><p>Mouse beta-cell line NIT-1 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006953-Hamaguchi1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref> were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA) and were cultured in Hams F12K media supplemented with 10&#x00025; fetal bovine serum and antibiotics.
