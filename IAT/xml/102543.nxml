These enzymes remove potentially lethal lesions such as thymine glycol and urea that are blocks to DNA replication <italic>in vitro</italic> and are lethal <italic>in vivo</italic> (for reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd162c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd162c2">2</xref>). <italic>nth</italic> (endo III) mutants are not X-ray sensitive and <italic>nei</italic> (endo VIII) mutants are only slightly X-ray sensitive, but <italic>nth nei</italic> double mutants are 1.4-fold more sensitive than wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd162c3">3</xref>). The double mutants are also 3- to 4-fold more sensitive to hydrogen peroxide than wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd162c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd162c5">5</xref>). These data show that X-rays and hydrogen peroxide form lethal lesions that are not repaired in the <italic>nth nei</italic> double mutants. For the most part, the single mutants exhibit wild-type sensitivity to X-rays indicating that the enzymes are able to substitute for each other in the cells. Endo VIII and endo III also remove free radical damaged cytosines, uracil glycol, dihydrouracil, 5-hydroxyuracil and 5-hydroxycytosine, all of which can mispair with adenosine during DNA synthesis <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd162c6">6</xref>) and are mutagenic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd162c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd162c8">8</xref>). <italic>nth</italic> mutants have a mild mutator phenotype, while <italic>nei</italic> mutants exhibit the same spontaneous mutation frequency as wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd162c3">3</xref>). Double mutants show a 20-fold increase in spontaneous mutation frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd162c3">3</xref>) and all the mutations are C&#x02192;T transitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd162c9">9</xref>). Again, it appears that the enzymes can substitute for each other in cells since the single mutants do not show a significant phenotype, although endo III appears to remove some premutagenic lesions that are not substrates for endo VIII.</p><p>There have been few studies on the regulation of oxidative base excision repair DNA glycosylases. No increase in endo VIII levels is observed after the administration of hydrogen peroxide, paraquat, agents that induce the SOS response, or in <italic>oxyR</italic> or <italic>soxR</italic> mutants constitutive for the hydrogen peroxide and superoxide inducible responses, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd162c10">10</xref>). There have been no reported studies on endo III regulation. Although our major goal is to define the regulatory controls for endo VIII and endo III, we first wanted to determine the transcriptional organization of <italic>nei</italic> and <italic>nth</italic>. If <italic>nei</italic> and <italic>nth</italic> are co-transcribed with surrounding genes, the other genes in the operons may play a role in or provide information about the regulation of the DNA glycosylases. We also wanted to determine if there was more than one promoter controlling the transcription of <italic>nei</italic> and <italic>nth</italic>. In this paper we report the transcript mapping of <italic>nei</italic> and <italic>nth</italic> and show that both genes are co-transcribed as the terminal genes in operons.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Bacterial strains</title><p><italic>Escherichia coli</italic> GC4468 &#x0005b;DE(<italic>argF</italic>-<italic>lac</italic>)169 &#x003bb;&#x02013; IN(<italic>rrnD</italic>-<italic>rrnE</italic>)1 <italic>rpsL179</italic>(<italic>strR</italic>)&#x0005d; was obtained from the Yale University <italic>E.coli</italic> Genetic Stock Center.</p></sec><sec><title>Growth conditions and RNA isolation</title><p><italic>Escherichia coli</italic> GC4468 cultures were grown as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd162c11">11</xref>).

There are four open reading frames (ORFs) upstream of <italic>nei</italic> that have the same orientation and could potentially be transcribed with <italic>nei</italic>. These ORFs are designated <italic>ybgI</italic>, <italic>ybgJ</italic>, <italic>ybgK</italic> and <italic>ybgL</italic> in GenBank accession no. AE000174, with <italic>ybgL</italic> immediately 5&#x02032; to <italic>nei</italic>. These ORFs encode proteins of unknown function. The gene immediately 3&#x02032; to <italic>nei</italic>, <italic>abrB</italic>, has been shown to be in the opposite orientation (M.Volkert, personal communication). <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> total RNA was reverse transcribed with primer nei19 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd162f1">1</xref>A shows the approximate annealing locations of the primers used in RT&#x02013;PCR), which anneals 336 bp 3&#x02032; to the <italic>nei</italic> start codon, and PCR was performed to determine the approximate size of the cDNA. Primer nei2 was the downstream primer and primers nei7 and nei8 were the upstream primers used in the PCR. Positive PCR controls were run with the two primer sets and genomic DNA as the template (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd162f1">1</xref>B, lanes 1 and 4). PCR with primer set nei7&#x0002f;nei2 yielded a product (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd162f1">1</xref>B, lane 3), indicating that the transcript extends from <italic>ybgI</italic> through <italic>nei</italic>. PCR with primer set nei8&#x0002f;nei2 did not yield a product (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd162f1">1</xref>B, lane 6), indicating that the upstream transcription initiation site for the operon is within 428 bp of the <italic>ybgI</italic> start codon. The negative control lanes (the PCR template was a RT reaction minus reverse transcriptase) were empty, showing that the RNA used in RT was not contaminated with DNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd162f2">2</xref>B, lanes 2 and 5).</p></sec><sec><title>The <italic>nei</italic> operon contains no internal promoters</title><p>RPAs were performed to map the locations of promoters and terminators in the operon. The antisense RNA probes used in the RPAs were designed to span the length of the operon from 5&#x02032; of the <italic>ybgI</italic> start codon to 3&#x02032; of the <italic>nei</italic> start codon (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd162f2">2</xref>A). The RPA with probe 1 resulted in a 282 and a 115 nt product (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd162f2">2</xref>B, lane 2) as predicted with a semilog plot of the distance traveled by the RNA markers. These products correspond to possible transcription initiation sites 192 and 25 bp 5&#x02032; to the <italic>ybgI</italic> start codon, respectively. Primer extension analysis was performed with primer 17 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd162f3">3</xref>A) to more precisely map the site corresponding to the 282 nt RPA product. Primer 17 was extended to a product of 115 nt (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd162f3">3</xref>B, lane 1), indicating there is a transcription initiation site at an A residue 208 bp 5&#x02032; of the <italic>ybgI</italic> start codon. The site is separated by 6 nt from a possible &#x02013;10 hexamer (TGTGTT), but there is no good match for a &#x02013;35 hexamer. The site corresponding to the 115 nt RPA product was mapped by primer extension analysis with primer 16. Primer 16 was extended to products of 99 and 124 nt (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd162f3">3</xref>B, lane 2). The size of the 124 nt product indicates that there is a transcription initiation site 29 bp 5&#x02032; to the <italic>ybgI</italic> start codon. This matches the RPA results within 4 nt. The site corresponds to a G residue and is separated by 6 bp from a possible &#x02013;10 hexamer (TATGTT) which is separated by 17 bp from a possible &#x02013;35 hexamer (TCGACG). Because of the position it maps to, it seems unlikely that the 99 nt product corresponds to a transcription initiation site upstream of <italic>ybgI</italic>. The sequence GAAGG is separated by 7 bp from the <italic>ybgI</italic> start codon and corresponds to part of the Shine&#x02013;Dalgarno consensus sequence UAAGGAGGU. The size of the 99 nt product would place a transcription initiation site 4 bp 5&#x02032; to the <italic>ybgI</italic> start codon, between the putative ribosome binding site and the start codon. It is possible that the 99 nt product was the result of non-specific binding of the primer. The RPA with probe 1 also resulted in very faint 474 and 426 nt products corresponding to possible transcription initiation sites 384 and 336 bp 5&#x02032; to the <italic>ybgI</italic> start codon. Attempts to map these sites by primer extension analysis were inconclusive, indicating that they correspond either to artifacts or to promoters that are too weak to be detected by primer extension.</p><p>The RPAs with probes 2&#x02013;5 all resulted in full-length products (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd162f2">2</xref>B, lanes 5 and 7, and C, lanes 2 and 4) that correspond to transcript read-through from the upstream ORFs. The RPA with probe 4 also resulted in some products shorter than full-length which disappeared after RNase T1 digestion alone (data not shown), suggesting that the bands corresponded to RNase A-sensitive sites. It was of particular interest to determine if <italic>nei</italic> has an independent promoter. The results with probe 5 do not support this being the case, at least under aerobic growth conditions in Luria&#x02013;Bertani broth. When <italic>nei</italic> was sequenced it was reported that there are potential &#x02013;35 (TTGTTG) and &#x02013;10 (TAATAA) like hexamers upstream of the <italic>nei</italic> start site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd162c3">3</xref>). In the present study no promoters were observed upstream of <italic>nei</italic> but it is possible that the putative promoter is active under stress conditions.</p><p>Probes 6 and 7 were used to map the terminator(s) of the operon. The RPA with probe 6 resulted in a full-length product and a 394 nt product (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd162f2">2</xref>D, lane 2). The RPA with probe 7 resulted in products of 394 and 596 nt and an upward smear towards full-length, but no distinct full-length product was detected (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd162f2">2</xref>D, lane 4). These results indicate that there are termination sites 79 and 281 bp 3&#x02032; of the <italic>nei</italic> stop codon and that there may be some additional read-through past the second termination site. Both of these sites correspond to potential stem&#x02013;loop structures identified by the Genetics Computer Groups&#x02019; program Stemloop. Neither of the potential stem&#x02013;loops are followed by a run of T residues, suggesting that they may correspond to rho-dependent terminators.</p><p>Taken together, these results indicate that <italic>nei</italic> is co-transcribed as the terminal gene in a five gene operon. There are two confirmed transcription initiation sites upstream of the predicted <italic>ybgI</italic> start codon and two transcript termination sites downstream of the <italic>nei</italic> stop codon.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>nth</italic> is part of an operon containing eight genes</title><p>There are eight ORFs upstream of <italic>nth</italic> that have the same orientation, as predicted in GenBank accession no. AE000258, and could potentially be transcribed with <italic>nth</italic>. These are designated <italic>ydgT</italic>, <italic>ydgK</italic>, <italic>ydgL</italic>, <italic>ydgM</italic>, <italic>ydgN</italic>, <italic>ydgO</italic>, <italic>ydgP</italic> and <italic>ydgQ</italic> on EcoMap10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd162c12">12</xref>) and are also designated b1625&#x02013;b1632 in GenBank accession no. AE000258. <italic>ydgQ</italic> is immediately 5&#x02032; of <italic>nth</italic>. The closest ORF 3&#x02032; of <italic>nth</italic> is predicted to be over 600 bp downstream, so is unlikely to be transcribed with <italic>nth</italic>.</p><p>To determine whether any of these ORFs are co-transcribed with <italic>nth</italic>, <italic>E.coli</italic> total RNA was reverse transcribed with two different primers. Primer nth2 anneals 53 bp 3&#x02032; to the <italic>nth</italic> start codon and nth5 anneals 566 bp 3&#x02032; to the <italic>nth</italic> start codon (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd162f4">4</xref>A). The cDNA from each RT reaction was used as a template in PCR reactions to determine their approximate length. nth20 was the downstream primer and nth19 and nth22 were the upstream primers used in the PCR. Positive PCR controls were run with the two primer sets and genomic DNA as the template (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd162f4">4</xref>B, lanes 1, 4, 10 and 13). PCR with primer set nth19&#x0002f;nth20 yielded a product in reactions with the cDNA template made with both primer nth2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd162f4">4</xref>B, lane 3) and primer nth5 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd162f4">4</xref>B, lane 12), suggesting that <italic>ydgK</italic> through <italic>nth</italic> are contained on the same transcript. PCR with primer set nth22&#x0002f;nth20 did not yield a product in reactions with the cDNA template made with either primer (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd162f4">4</xref>B, lanes 6 and 15), indicating that the transcript begins between the annealing site of nth22 and the annealing site of nth19. The experiments were not designed to determine whether <italic>ydgT</italic> is part of the operon. It should be pointed out that it was not possible to obtain PCR product that spanned the length from <italic>ydgK</italic> to <italic>nth</italic>, but it was possible to obtain smaller PCR products along the length of <italic>ydgK</italic> to <italic>nth</italic> (data not shown). This could be due to low abundance RNA transcripts leading to poor production of cDNA in the reverse transcription reaction. The negative control lanes were empty, showing that the RNA used in RT was not contaminated with DNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd162f4">4</xref>B, lanes 2, 5, 11 and 14).</p></sec><sec><title>The <italic>nth</italic> operon contains two promoters</title><p>RPAs were performed to confirm the RT&#x02013;PCR results, to determine if <italic>ydgT</italic> is part of the operon and to determine the locations of promoters and terminators in the operon. The RNA antisense probes used in the RPAs were designed to span the length of the operon from 5&#x02032; of the <italic>ydgT</italic> start codon to 3&#x02032; of the <italic>nth</italic> start codon (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd162f5">5</xref>A and 6A). The RPA with probe 1 resulted in a 320 nt product (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd162f5">5</xref>B, lane 2). There was some faint smearing above the 320 nt product but no other distinct products were observed. The size of the product suggests that it corresponds to a transcription initiation site 4 bp 5&#x02032; to the <italic>ydgK</italic> start codon. The lack of a larger product indicates that <italic>ydgT</italic> is not co-transcribed with the downstream genes. Primer extension analysis was performed with primer nth26 which was extended to a product of 117 nt (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd162f7">7</xref>B), confirming that there is an initiation site at a T residue 18 bp 5&#x02032; to the <italic>ydgK</italic> start codon. This site is separated by 7 nt from one possible &#x02013;10 hexamer (TAATAA) and is separated by 9 nt from another (TATAAT). These &#x02013;10 hexamers are separated by 18 and 16 nt, respectively, from a possible &#x02013;35 hexamer (TAGCGA).</p><p>The RPA with probe 2 resulted in a full-length product and products of 272 and 212 nt (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd162f5">5</xref>B, lane 4). The full-length product corresponds to transcript read-through from <italic>ydgK</italic> into <italic>ydgL</italic>. An RPA was performed with probe 3 in order to determine if the less than full-length products were due to 5&#x02032; or 3&#x02032; probe digestion. This assay resulted in products of 750, 544 and 222 nt (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd162f5">5</xref>C, lane 2). The 750 nt product corresponds to the initiation site upstream of <italic>ydgK</italic>. The 544 nt product resulted from 3&#x02032; probe digestion to the <italic>ydgK</italic> initiation site and 5&#x02032; probe digestion to a termination site, and indicates that the 272 nt product obtained with probe 2 was due to 5&#x02032; probe digestion. This shows that there was some transcript termination in the intergenic region between <italic>ydgK</italic> and <italic>ydgL</italic>. The 222 nt product obtained with probe 3 corresponds to the 212 nt product obtained with probe 2 and indicates that there is a transcription initiation site 5&#x02032; to the <italic>ydgL</italic> start codon. Primer extension analysis was performed with primer nth20 which was extended to a product of 110 nt (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd162f7">7</xref>C), indicating there is an initiation site at a T residue 12 bp 5&#x02032; to the <italic>ydgL</italic> start codon. This site is separated by 3 nt from a possible &#x02013;10 hexamer (TTTTTT) which is separated by 17 nt from a possible &#x02013;35 hexamer (TGGATT).</p><p>The RPAs with probes 4&#x02013;11 all resulted in full-length products, confirming that the transcript extends from <italic>ydgK</italic> to <italic>nth</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd162f5">5</xref>D, lanes 2 and 4, E, lanes 2 and 4, and Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd162f6">6</xref>B, lanes 2 and 4, and C, lanes 2 and 4). There is some smearing below the full-length product with probes 6&#x02013;10. This is due to slight degradation of the RNA probe used in the RPAs (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd162f5">5</xref>E, lanes 1 and 3, and Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd162f6">6</xref>B, lanes 1 and 3, and C, lanes 1 and 3). The bands seen below full-length product with probes 9 and 10 disappear with RNase T1 digestion alone (data not shown), indicating that they are due to non-specific cleavage by RNase A. It was of particular interest to determine whether <italic>nth</italic> has its own promoter. The RPA with probe 11 showed some faint bands less than full length that could potentially correspond to a transcription initiation site, but when primer extension analysis was performed with several different primers (data not shown), it was not possible to detect an initiation site upstream of the <italic>nth</italic> start codon. When <italic>nth</italic> was originally sequenced it was reported to have a potential ribosome binding site, but no sequences similar to a consensus <italic>E.coli</italic> promoter were found preceding the gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd162c13">13</xref>).</p><p>Probe 12 was used to map the terminator(s) of the operon and resulted in a product of 344 nt (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd162f6">6</xref>D, lane 2). This transcript termination site corresponds to a C residue 16 bp 3&#x02032; to the <italic>nth</italic> stop codon. This residue is at the center of a predicted region of dyad symmetry capable of folding into a hairpin stem&#x02013;loop structure which may act as a rho-dependent terminator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd162c13">13</xref>).</p><p>These results confirm that <italic>nth</italic> is co-transcribed as the terminal gene in an eight gene operon. There are two transcription initiation sites, one upstream of the predicted <italic>ydgK</italic> start codon and one upstream of the predicted <italic>ydgL</italic> start codon, and there is a single transcript termination site downstream of the <italic>nth</italic> stop codon. In addition, there appears to be some transcript termination in the intergenic region between <italic>ydgK</italic> and <italic>ydgL</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>The gene order of the operons is conserved or partially conserved in other organisms</title><p>BLAST searches were performed with the finished and unfinished genome databases at the NCBI Website using the <italic>E.coli</italic> amino acid sequences for the products of each gene in both operons. The searches using the amino acid sequences for the products of the genes in the <italic>nei</italic> operon showed that there is only one obvious endo VIII homolog, in <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic>, but that it is not in the same location as in the <italic>E.coli</italic> genome. In <italic>S.typhimurium</italic>, the homologs of <italic>ybgI</italic>&#x02013;<italic>ybgL</italic> are located together but <italic>nei</italic> is not next to <italic>ybgL</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd162f8">8</xref>). It has also been suggested that there is an endo VIII homolog in <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd162c14">14</xref>), but the order of genes surrounding the possible homolog is not the same as in <italic>E.coli</italic>. <italic>ybgJ</italic>, <italic>ybgK</italic> and <italic>ybgL</italic> have been well conserved in other organisms, either in the same order as in the <italic>nei</italic> operon or in the order <italic>ybgL</italic>, <italic>ybgJ</italic>, <italic>ybgK</italic>, although it is not known whether they are also transcribed together in the other organisms. This suggests that there could be some regulatory or functional significance for these genes being grouped together, since this grouping is found in Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria and also in&#x000a0;Archea. These ORFs encode unknown proteins but the products of <italic>ybgJ</italic> and <italic>ybgK</italic> are putative carboxylases and the product of <italic>ybgL</italic> is a putative lactam utilization protein as reported in GenBank accession no. AE000174. In <italic>E.coli</italic> it appears that <italic>nei</italic> was arbitrarily tacked onto the end of these genes making it seem unlikely that there is a regulatory or functional significance for <italic>nei</italic> being the last gene in this operon. However, since <italic>nei</italic> does not appear to have its own promoter, at least under the growth conditions used, it is under the regulatory control of the two upstream promoters.</p><p>The searches using the amino acid sequences for the products of the genes in the <italic>nth</italic> operon showed that the gene order of the operon has been completely conserved in <italic>S.typhimurium</italic> and <italic>Yersinia pestis</italic> and that the order of <italic>ydgL</italic> through <italic>nth</italic> has been conserved in at least four other Gram-negative organisms (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd162f9">9</xref>). The functions of the proteins encoded by the ORFs is unknown, but <italic>ydgL</italic> through <italic>ydgQ</italic> show homology to the genes <italic>rnfA</italic>, <italic>rnfB</italic>, <italic>rnfC</italic>, <italic>rnfD</italic>, <italic>rnfG</italic> and <italic>rnfE</italic> of <italic>Rhodobacter capsulatis</italic>, a purple non-sulfur photosynthetic bacterium. <italic>Rnf</italic> stands for <underline><italic>R</italic></underline><italic>hodobacter</italic><underline>n</underline>itrogen <underline>f</underline>ixation and these genes are required for nitrogen fixation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd162c15">15</xref>). These genes, along with a seventh gene, <italic>rnfH</italic>, make up a seven gene operon under the control of a &#x003c3;<sup>54</sup> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd162c15">15</xref>). In <italic>E.coli</italic> and in the other bacteria shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkd162f9">9</xref>, <italic>rnfH</italic> has been replaced by <italic>nth</italic>. It has been proposed that the Rnf proteins form a membrane complex that functions as an intermediate in electron transport to nitrogenase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd162c15">15</xref>), but it is unclear whether RnfH is part of this complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd162c16">16</xref>). RnfA, RnfD and RnfE are predicted on the basis of hydrophobicity to be integral membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd162c15">15</xref>) and RnfA has been shown to have six membrane-spanning hydrophobic segments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd162c17">17</xref>). RnfB and RnfC are &#x0005b;Fe-S&#x0005d;-containing proteins that are tightly bound to the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd162c16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd162c17">17</xref>) and RnfC is predicted to contain potential NAD(H) and FMN binding sites which are similar to those found in proton-translocating NADH:quinone oxidoreductases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd162c17">17</xref>). RnfG and RnfH are predicted to be largely soluble proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd162c15">15</xref>). Since <italic>E.coli</italic> and the other organisms that have homologs to the <italic>rnf</italic> genes do not fix nitrogen, it has been predicted that these genes represent a new family of energy coupling NADH oxidoreductases that are distributed in a wide range of bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd162c17">17</xref>). If the terminal electron acceptor in this system is oxygen, it might make sense that <italic>nth</italic> is transcribed with these genes since partially reduced oxygen species that escape can cause the types of DNA damage that endo III repairs. However, it has been speculated that the electron acceptor may be ferrodoxin, as is thought to be the case with the Rnf complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd162c17">17</xref>).</p><p>Studies are currently underway to examine the regulation of these operons. It has recently been shown that the genes for two other oxidative base excision repair DNA glycosylases, <italic>fpg</italic> and <italic>mutY</italic>, are also co-transcribed as part of operons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkd162c11">11</xref>). <italic>fpg</italic> is the last gene in a four gene operon with internal promoters and a strong attenuator between <italic>fpg</italic> and the upstream genes. <italic>fpg</italic> has its own promoter which appears to be weakly expressed during aerobic growth in LB broth. <italic>mutY</italic> is the first gene in a four gene operon with internal promoters and multiple attenuators. In contrast, <italic>nei</italic> and <italic>nth</italic> are part of simpler operons. Neither gene appears to have an independent promoter under the growth conditions used in this study, although <italic>nei</italic> has a putative promoter consensus sequence upstream of its start codon which could potentially be used under stress conditions.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkd162f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Mapping of the <italic>nei</italic> transcript by RT&#x02013;PCR.
