Defects in this form of synaptic plasticity have been associated with the pathophysiological manifestations of many neurodegenerative diseases and mental illnesses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zoghbi, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Levitt et al., 2004</xref>). Increasing evidence suggests that signaling cascades initiated by secreted molecules such as bone morphogenic protein (BMP), Wnt/wingless (Wg), and FGF are essential for the coordinated assembly of the synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Packard et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">McCabe et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Waites et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hodge et al., 2007</xref>). Despite recent progress, we know little about how these signaling cascades are modulated in neurons to ensure appropriate synaptic growth. In this study, we describe a mechanism by which BMP signaling is modulated through interaction between the Nemo (Nmo) kinase and the BMP transcription factor Mad in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> larval motor neurons.</p><p>In vertebrates, BMP signaling has been shown to control different aspects of neuronal development both in the spinal cord and the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Liu and Niswander, 2005</xref>). The role for BMP signaling in regulating synaptic growth has been well characterized at the <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval neuromuscular junction (NMJ). Based on the current evidence, the BMP ligand Glass Bottom Boat provides a retrograde signal from the muscle back to the nerve terminal; this signal is processed by a receptor complex comprised of the type I BMP receptors Thickveins (Tkv) and Saxophone and the type II BMP receptor Wishful thinking. Receptor activation then leads to an increase in the phosphorylation of the R-Smad Mad at the NMJ terminals followed by nuclear translocation of phosphorylated Mad (p-Mad) through its interaction with the co-Smad Medea. Mutations of the members of this cascade lead to a drastic reduction in the number of synaptic boutons and the amount of neurotransmitter release at the NMJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aberle et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Marques et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">McCabe et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">2004</xref>).</p><p>A large body of research has provided evidence for Smad regulation by several posttranslational mechanisms such as ubiquitination, phosphorylation, and sumoylation, to name a few (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ross and Hill, 2008</xref>); however, we know little about how Smads are regulated in neurons. In a forward genetic suppressor screen, we have identified Nmo kinase as a regulator of synaptic growth at the <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval NMJ. Our findings provide evidence that the normal function of Mad depends on its phosphorylation by Nmo. Interaction between Nmo and Mad provides a mechanism for the modulation of BMP signaling in motor neurons and thus the structural growth and function of synaptic boutons at the NMJ.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Nmo is required in motor neurons for normal synaptic growth at the larval NMJ</title><p>Loss-of-function mutations in the E3 ubiquitin ligase <italic>highwire</italic> (<italic>hiw</italic>) lead to extensive synaptic expansion at the NMJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wan et al., 2000</xref>). We reasoned that if a candidate gene could dominantly suppress the synaptic expansion in <italic>hiw</italic> mutants, it would likely be involved in the regulation of synaptic growth. To search for such candidate genes, we tested whether inclusion of a chromosome containing deletions (deficiency chromosome) could dominantly suppress the synaptic expansion in <italic>hiw</italic> mutants. We focused on chromosomal deficiency lines available on the left arm of the third chromosome and found that <italic>hiw</italic> larvae with one copy of <italic>Df(3L)pbl-X1</italic> showed significantly less synaptic expansion compared with <italic>hiw</italic> larvae. We tested genetic interaction with smaller overlapping deficiencies and were able to identify the gene <italic>nmo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Choi and Benzer, 1994</xref>) as the locus responsible (see Materials and methods; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200809127/DC1">Fig. S1</ext-link>).</p><p>Nmo is the founding member of the evolutionarily conserved Nmo-like kinase family of serine/threonine kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Choi and Benzer, 1994</xref>). Nmo was first identified as a regulator of epithelial planar cell polarity during eye development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Choi and Benzer, 1994</xref>). Moreover, Nmo has been implicated in several developmental processes, including the regulation of patterning and imaginal disc development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zheng et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Verheyen et al., 2001</xref>), but its function in the nervous system has not been characterized. To study the role of Nmo in synaptic growth, we examined NMJs from wandering third instar larvae using antibodies against pre- and postsynaptic markers. NMJs undergo rapid structural and functional growth in the few days of larval development; during this time, the number of synaptic boutons increases several fold to keep up with the growing muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Schuster et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Keshishian, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Davis, 2006</xref>). This coordinated growth appeared defective in <italic>nmo</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>); however, we did not observe any detectable abnormalities in the pattern of innervation of the body wall muscles in <italic>nmo</italic> mutant larvae (not depicted), suggesting that motor neuronal pathfinding and initial target recognition are not affected. A feature of wild-type NMJs is the presence of chains of synaptic boutons organized like beads on a string (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Budnik et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Zito et al., 1999</xref>) forming synaptic branches that contain as many as 20 boutons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>). However, in <italic>nmo</italic> mutants, this feature was severely affected, as most NMJs lacked branches containing more than five boutons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, B and C</xref>). Different genetically null alleles of <italic>nmo</italic> in trans-allelic and homozygous combinations showed a strong reduction in the number of type I synaptic boutons (86.5 &#x000b1; 3.0 and 54.5 &#x000b1; 3.6 for wild type and <italic>nmo<sup>P</sup></italic>/<italic>Df(3L)Exel6279</italic>, respectively; <italic>n</italic> = 20; P &#x0003c; 0.001) at muscles 6 and 7. Type I glutamatergic boutons have been divided into two categories, big (type Ib) and small (type Is), based on their size as well as on the intensity of their Discs large (Dlg) signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>, arrowhead and arrow; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Budnik et al., 1996</xref>). We found that both Ib and Is boutons were reduced in <italic>nmo</italic> mutants. We observed a similar reduction in the number of boutons at muscle 4 NMJs (58.9 &#x000b1; 2.6 and 35.3 &#x000b1; 3.3 for wild type and <italic>nmo<sup>P</sup></italic>/<italic>Df(3L)Exel6279</italic>, respectively; <italic>n</italic> = 20; P &#x0003c; 0.001). To accurately reflect the role of Nmo in coordinated synaptic growth, we normalized the total number of boutons at every NMJ to the corresponding muscle surface area (MSA). This approach avoids any biases that might arise as the result of variations in the muscle size among different larvae. Our quantifications showed that in <italic>nmo</italic> mutants, the number of boutons per MSA was reduced by &#x0223c;40% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Nmo is required for normal synaptic growth at the NMJ.</bold> (A) Wild-type (wt) third instar larval NMJ synapses at muscles 6 and 7 in the third abdominal segment double stained with anti-Dlg (red) and anti-HRP (green).

We were able to detect a specific anti&#x02013;&#x003b2;-gal signal in a subset of neurons, including all motor neurons, in the ventral nerve cord. To confirm the identity of the &#x003b2;-gal&#x02013;positive neurons in <italic>nmo<sup>P</sup></italic>, we costained the ventral nerve cord with an antibody against p-Mad; p-Mad normally accumulates in the nuclei of motor neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Marques et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">McCabe et al., 2003</xref>). We found that all p-Mad&#x02013;positive motor neurons were also positive for &#x003b2;-gal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, A&#x02013;F</xref>). To further assess the expression pattern of the <italic>nmo</italic> transcript, we generated larvae that contained one copy of <italic>nmo<sup>P</sup></italic> enhancer trap while expressing upstream activating sequence (UAS)&#x02013;mCD8-GFP in all motor neurons using motor neuronal Gal4 driver BG380; double staining of ventral nerve cords with anti-GFP and anti&#x02013;&#x003b2;-gal antibodies revealed that the <italic>nmo</italic> transcript is not exclusively expressed in motor neurons (unpublished data). Next, we wished to examine the pattern of expression of Nmo protein; however, the available Nmo antibodies failed to detect a specific signal. Thus, we turned to a GFP-Nmo fusion transgene (UAS-GFP-Nmo; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fiehler and Wolff, 2008</xref>) to investigate whether Nmo can localize at synaptic sites. We detected GFP signal at all NMJ synapses after overexpression of UAS-GFP-Nmo using BG380-Gal4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, G and H</xref>), suggesting that Nmo protein can localize to the NMJ. In addition, we found that GFP-Nmo was evenly distributed in motor neuronal cell bodies and nuclei without any apparent concentration in any compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 I</xref>). We did not find a significant change in the number of boutons per MSA in response to Nmo overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 J</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Nmo is required in motor neurons for normal synaptic growth at the NMJ.</bold> (A) &#x003b2;-gal staining in the ventral nerve cord of larvae heterozygous for <italic>nmo<sup>P</sup></italic>.

The presence of <italic>nmo</italic> transcription in motor neurons, the ability of Nmo protein to localize to presynaptic structures, and the rescue of synaptic defects in <italic>nmo</italic> mutants by presynaptic Nmo together led us to conclude that Nmo is required in presynaptic motor neurons for normal growth of NMJ synaptic structures.</p></sec><sec><title>Nmo binds Mad and is required for normal accumulation of p-Mad in motor neurons</title><p>Our findings indicated that genetic reduction of <italic>nmo</italic> in motor neurons can significantly suppress NMJ overexpansion in <italic>hiw</italic> mutants (Fig. S1, A&#x02013;D). Previously, it has been shown that loss of Wallenda (Wnd), a MAPK kinase kinase, can lead to suppression of the <italic>hiw</italic> loss-of-function phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Collins et al., 2006</xref>). Wnd levels are up-regulated in the central nervous system of <italic>hiw</italic> mutant larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Collins et al., 2006</xref>). Therefore, we tested whether Wnd protein levels in the central nervous system are affected as a consequence of loss of <italic>nmo</italic>. We found no detectable changes in the levels of anti-Wnd antibody signal associated with loss of <italic>nmo</italic> (Fig. S1, E&#x02013;I). Synaptic overexpansion in <italic>hiw</italic> mutants is also dependent on normal BMP signaling in motor neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">McCabe et al., 2004</xref>). Moreover, it has recently been demonstrated that Nmo can interact with and phosphorylate the BMP transcription factor Mad in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Zeng et al., 2007</xref>). Therefore, we examined whether Nmo participates in the regulation of BMP signaling in motor neurons. As a first step, we set out to test whether the normal accumulation of p-Mad is affected in <italic>nmo</italic> mutants. p-Mad accumulation at the terminals and in the nuclei of motor neurons is an indicator of retrograde BMP signaling at the NMJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Marques et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">McCabe et al., 2003</xref>). Using an anti&#x02013;p-Mad antibody, we were able to detect p-Mad in the nuclei of motor neurons in wild-type and <italic>nmo</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, A&#x02013;F</xref>); however, our quantification of the fluorescence intensity associated with the p-Mad signal in the ventral nerve cord showed an &#x0223c;30% (P &#x0003c; 0.001) decrease in <italic>nmo</italic> mutants compared with wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, A&#x02013;F and J</xref>). In contrast, we found a strong increase in the p-Mad signal at the NMJs. We quantified this increase in two ways. First, we measured the intensity of the signal per individual p-Mad punctum between the two groups and found that <italic>nmo</italic> mutants show a 25% increase compared with wild type (P &#x0003c; 0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 K&#x02013;P and T</xref>). Second, we measured the total amount of fluorescence per synaptic area for p-Mad and normalized it to the amount of fluorescence for Fas2 in the same synaptic area between the two groups; using this measurement, we found that p-Mad signal was increased by 35% in <italic>nmo</italic> mutants compared with wild type (<italic>n</italic> = 16; P &#x0003c; 0.001). The p-Mad signal in <italic>nmo</italic> mutants was restored to normal levels when we provided Nmo in motor neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, G&#x02013;J and Q&#x02013;T</xref>). To rule out the possibility that the abnormal accumulation of p-Mad is merely caused by a general defect in axonal transport in <italic>nmo</italic> mutants, we examined motor axons in <italic>nmo</italic> and wild-type larvae after overexpression of UAS-Mito-GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cox and Spradling, 2003</xref>). UAS-Mito-GFP is a marker for mitochondria and can be used in live larvae to assess retrograde and anterograde axonal transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Pilling et al., 2006</xref>). We did not find any abnormalities or apparent differences in the accumulation of Mito-GFP puncta in <italic>nmo</italic> mutant larvae (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200809127/DC1">Fig. S2, A&#x02013;E</ext-link>). Similarly, we did not observe any apparent differences in the accumulation of synaptotagmin (Syt; Fig. S2, F&#x02013;N), Bruchpilot, or Fas2 in axons of <italic>nmo</italic> mutant larvae (not depicted). These results suggest that Nmo specifically influences p-Mad distribution and accumulation in motor neurons.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>Nmo is required for the normal accumulation of p-Mad in motor neurons, and it colocalizes and coimmunoprecipitates with Mad.</bold> (A&#x02013;I) Motor neuron nuclei in third instar larval ventral nerve cords double stained with DAPI (red) and p-Mad (green) in wild-type (wt; A&#x02013;C), <italic>nmo</italic> mutant (D&#x02013;F), and <italic>nmo</italic> mutant larva overexpressing UAS-Nmo in motor neurons (G&#x02013;I).

For this, we generated an Myc-tagged Mad transgene and coexpressed it together with GFP-Nmo in all motor neurons.

However, closer analysis of the Myc signal revealed a proportional increase at the NMJ versus motor neuronal nuclei for Myc-Mad<sup>S25A</sup> compared with Myc-Mad. For this, we generated an index representing the Myc signal at the NMJ in relation to the Myc signal in the nuclei of motor neurons for each larva. Using confocal projections, we measured the amount of fluorescence signal at the NMJ per area and divided that by the amount of fluorescence per area obtained from motor neuronal nuclei for each larva (see Materials and methods). On average, larvae expressing Myc-Mad<sup>S25A</sup> showed a &#x0003e;50% increase in this index compared with larvae that expressed Myc-Mad (P &#x0003c; 0.05; <italic>n</italic> = 12; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 L</xref>), which is reminiscent of the distribution of p-Mad in <italic>nmo</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>).

Similarly, the nuclear fraction of Myc signal in larvae overexpressing UAS-Myc-Mad<sup>S25A</sup> was not different from that of wild-type UAS-Myc-Mad (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 M</xref>). These findings are consistent with our earlier observations of p-Mad distribution in <italic>nmo</italic> mutant larvae and suggest that phosphorylation of Mad at serine 25 by Nmo is not essential for normal nuclear export of Mad in motor neurons. Nevertheless, these results do not rule out the possibility that Nmo can induce nuclear export of Mad when overexpressed, as observed previously by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Zeng et al.

We generated a transgenic Nmo carrying a point mutation in a critical residue in the catalytic domain of Nmo, UAS-GFP-Nmo<sup>K69M</sup>. When overexpressed in motor neurons, GFP-Nmo<sup>K69M</sup> localized to NMJ terminals in a manner similar to GFP-Nmo but caused a mild reduction in the number of boutons (Fig. S4, A&#x02013;E), suggesting that it perhaps acts as a dominant negative. We tested whether Nmo<sup>K69M</sup> can rescue the abnormal p-Mad distribution in motor neurons in <italic>nmo</italic> mutants, and, not surprisingly, we found that it failed to restore p-Mad to normal levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4, N&#x02013;W</xref>; and Fig. S4, F&#x02013;I).

This trans-heterozygous interaction was rescued by neuronal overexpression of Nmo in different trans-allelic combinations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 E</xref>). To further examine the functional interaction between Mad and Nmo, we tested synaptic structures in <italic>Mad;nmo</italic> double mutants.

These results suggest that Mad and Nmo most likely function together in the same pathway to control synaptic growth at the NMJ. These results also raise the possibility that an increase in BMP signaling may be capable of restoring synaptic defects in <italic>nmo</italic> mutants. We tested this hypothesis by overexpressing either UAS-Myc-Mad or a constitutively active form of the type I BMP receptor Tkv (UAS-Tkv-act; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hoodless et al., 1996</xref>) in motor neurons in <italic>nmo</italic> mutant larvae.

Our analysis of synaptic structures showed no significant change in the number of synaptic boutons in response to Nmo overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 J</xref>); however, unexpectedly, we found a drastic reduction in both EJCs and quantal content in response to Nmo overexpression in motor neurons (quantal content, 25.92 &#x000b1; 4.7 for control vs. 14.38 &#x000b1; 1.49 for UAS-GFP-Nmo; <italic>n</italic> = 12; P = 0.012; EJC, P = 0.007; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6, F and G</xref>). To learn about the relationship between this negative regulation and Nmo's interaction with Mad, we evaluated the distribution of Myc-Mad in motor neurons in response to Nmo gain-of-function. We found that in these larvae, Myc-Mad was present in both motor neuronal cell bodies and nuclei as well as at the NMJ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6, H&#x02013;J</xref>); however, the nuclear distribution of Myc-Mad appeared severely affected. Although Myc-Mad normally shows a strong concentration in the nuclei of motor neurons, when overexpressed together with GFP-Nmo, the Myc signal appeared evenly distributed in the cell body to a point that most nuclei were not easily detectable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 I</xref>). These results reveal a potential role for Nmo in the negative regulation of Mad, a role which was not revealed through our analysis of <italic>nmo</italic> loss-of-function, and highlight the ability of Nmo to regulate synaptic structural growth and neurotransmitter release differentially.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our findings point to a model in which Nmo phosphorylation of Mad promotes its accumulation in the nuclei of motor neurons and thereby ensures effective BMP signaling at the NMJ. <italic>nmo</italic> mutant larvae show a significant aberration in the accumulation and/or distribution of p-Mad in motor neurons, with elevated levels of p-Mad at the NMJ and decreased levels of p-Mad in the nuclei of motor neurons. In addition, when Mad is mutated at its phosphorylation site for Nmo (Mad<sup>S25A</sup>), it shows an expression pattern that qualitatively resembles that of p-Mad in <italic>nmo</italic> mutants, with more accumulation at the NMJ and less accumulation in the nucleus compared with wild-type Mad. Consistent with the importance of this phosphorylation, Mad<sup>S25A</sup> fails to rescue synaptic structural defects in Mad mutants effectively. These observations suggest that phosphorylation of Mad by Nmo most likely modulates Mad's function by regulating its distribution and accumulation in motor neurons. Based on our findings, it is tempting to conclude that the reduction in the number of NMJ synaptic boutons in <italic>nmo</italic> mutants is, to a large extent, caused by the failure of p-Mad to signal to the nucleus effectively. In support of this, we reveal a strong trans-heterozygous interaction between <italic>nmo</italic> and <italic>Mad</italic> and show that synaptic defects in <italic>nmo</italic> mutants can be partially rescued by overexpression of a constitutively active form of Tkv (Tkv-act). Although our current findings provide strong support for this model, we cannot rule out the possibility that Nmo is involved in other processes that contribute to the growth of synaptic boutons at the NMJ.</p><p>We find that, in contrast to its critical role in the regulation of synaptic structure, Nmo does not play an important role in the regulation of synaptic function; in the absence of <italic>nmo</italic>, quantal content remains at normal levels. Consistently, we find that the Mad<sup>S25A</sup> transgene is capable of rescuing the severe electrophysiological defects of <italic>Mad</italic> mutants as efficiently as a wild-type Mad transgene. Previously, it has been suggested that structural growth and the homeostasis of neurotransmitter release at the NMJ have different requirements for BMP signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Goold and Davis, 2007</xref>). Similarly, our findings highlight the differential requirements for the regulation of synaptic structure and synaptic strength via BMP signaling. Interestingly, although overexpression of Nmo in motor neurons does not influence synaptic structural growth, it does cause a significant reduction in neurotransmitter release. This observation is consistent with those made by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Zeng et al. (2007)</xref>, showing an antagonistic effect of Nmo gain-of-function on Mad in the wing imaginal discs. Nevertheless, although this observation shows a potential for Nmo to act as a negative regulator of Mad, our findings argue against a significant negative regulatory role for Nmo in motor neurons under normal physiological conditions.</p><p>We propose that Nmo exerts its action primarily by modulating Mad's retrograde movement from the NMJ to the nucleus. Nmo has been implicated in the regulation of Mad nuclear export in heterologous cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Zeng et al., 2007</xref>); however, we find no evidence for changes in Mad nuclear export as a consequence of loss of <italic>nmo</italic>. In contrast, we find that Nmo is required for accumulation of p-Mad in the nuclei of motor neurons. In the absence of <italic>nmo</italic>, p-Mad levels increase at the NMJ and decrease in the nuclei of motor neurons, suggesting that Nmo is required for normal translocation/trafficking of Mad from the NMJ to the nucleus.</p><p>Finally, we show that, consistent with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Zeng et al., 2007</xref>), overexpression of Nmo can reduce the proportion of Mad concentration in nuclei versus that in cell bodies of motor neurons. Based on the phenotypic consequences of <italic>nmo</italic> loss- and gain-of-function, it appears that normal growth of synaptic structures at the NMJ depends on continuous and efficient BMP signaling from the NMJ to the nuclei of motor neurons and is less sensitive to the residence time of Mad in the nucleus. However, it appears that regulation of neurotransmitter release is more sensitive to the residence time of Mad in the nucleus and less dependent on the continuous retrograde signaling from the NMJ. Our findings highlight the importance of Nmo phosphorylation of Mad at serine 25 in this process; however, a comprehensive understanding of the regulation of Mad trafficking and movement dynamics in different cellular compartments will require future studies.</p><p>Finally, an intriguing possibility would be the involvement of the Wg pathway in the regulation of Mad dynamics through Nmo. Nmo has been implicated in the Wg pathway during wing development and has been shown to be a transcriptional target of Wg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Zeng and Verheyen, 2004</xref>). As Wg has been shown to participate in the regulation of synaptic growth at the NMJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Packard et al., 2002</xref>), it would be tempting to envisage a role for Wg in the regulation of Nmo transcription in motor neurons and thus a link between the Wg and BMP pathways in the regulation of synaptic growth and function at the NMJ.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Fly stocks</title><p>Flies were cultured on standard medium at 25&#x000b0;C.

The peak signal intensities of p-Mad puncta, from &#x0223c;150 boutons per genotype, were then plotted and compared across genotypes. Alternatively, we quantified p-Mad at the NMJ by measuring the integrated fluorescence signal associated with p-Mad and normalizing it to the Fas2 signal at the same NMJ using MetaMorph software.</p><p>For Myc quantification at the NMJ, the integrated fluorescence signal per synaptic area was measured using the HRP signal to delineate synaptic boutons. To assess the fluorescence signals associated with p-Mad, &#x003b2;-gal, and Myc in the nuclei of motor neurons, a standard area of 25 &#x000b5;m<sup>2</sup> per motor neuron nucleus was used for larval segments A5, A6, and A7. Signals were quantified with MetaMorph software.</p><p>To generate the relative fluorescence intensity between the NMJ and motor neuronal nuclei for Myc-Mad versus Myc-Mad<sup>S25A</sup>, we divided the mean intensity per area, measured for at least 50 boutons, by the mean intensity per area for at least 30 motor neurons for each larva. To quantify Syt accumulation in axons, maximum projections of larval axons stained with anti-Syt were generated from stacked confocal images. MetaMorph software was used to determine the number of large Syt puncta (&#x02265;0.75 &#x000b5;m in diameter) present in each projection.</p></sec><sec><title>Electrophysiology</title><p>Wandering third instar larvae were dissected in cold HL3 solution according to standard protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Stewart et al., 1994</xref>).
