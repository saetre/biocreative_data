Two HHV-6 variants are known: HHV-6A and HHV-6B. Active infection or reactivation of HHV-6 in the brain is associated with neurological disorders, including epilepsy, encephalitis, and multiple sclerosis. In a preliminary study, we found HHV-6B DNA in resected brain tissue from patients with mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE) and have localized viral antigen to glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)&#x02013;positive glia in the same brain sections. We sought, first, to determine the extent of HHV-6 infection in brain material resected from MTLE and non-MTLE patients; and second, to establish in vitro primary astrocyte cultures from freshly resected brain material and determine expression of glutamate transporters.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Methods and Findings</title><p>HHV-6B infection in astrocytes and brain specimens was investigated in resected brain material from MTLE and non-MTLE patients using PCR and immunofluorescence. HHV-6B viral DNA was detected by TaqMan PCR in brain resections from 11 of 16 (69&#x00025;) additional patients with MTLE and from zero of seven (0&#x00025;) additional patients without MTLE. All brain regions that tested positive by HHV-6B variant-specific TaqMan PCR were positive for viral DNA by nested PCR. Primary astrocytes were isolated and cultured from seven epilepsy brain resections and astrocyte purity was defined by GFAP reactivity. HHV-6 gp116/54/64 antigen was detected in primary cultured GFAP-positive astrocytes from resected tissue that was HHV-6 DNA positive&#x02014;the first demonstration of an ex vivo HHV-6&#x02013;infected astrocyte culture isolated from HHV-6&#x02013;positive brain material. Previous work has shown that MTLE is related to glutamate transporter dysfunction. We infected astrocyte cultures in vitro with HHV-6 and found a marked decrease in glutamate transporter EAAT-2 expression.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Overall, we have now detected HHV-6B in 15 of 24 patients with mesial temporal sclerosis/MTLE, in contrast to zero of 14 with other syndromes.

Its symptoms depend on which part of the brain is affected by this electrical firestorm and how far the disturbance spreads. When only part of the brain is affected (a partial seizure or fit), patients may see or smell strange things, recall forgotten memories, or have part of their body jerk uncontrollably. When the electrical disturbance spreads across the whole brain (a generalized seizure), there may be loss of consciousness and/or the whole body may become rigid or jerk. Epilepsy is usually controlled with anti-epileptic drugs or, in very severe focal cases, surgery to the area of the brain where the seizure starts. Although head injuries or brain tumors can trigger epilepsy, the cause of most cases of epilepsy is unknown.</p></sec><sec id="sb1b"><title>Why Was This Study Done?</title><p>Knowing what causes epilepsy might lead to better treatments for it. One possibility is that infections trigger epilepsy. The researchers in this study asked whether infections with human herpesvirus 6B (HHV-6B) are associated with a common type of epilepsy called mesial temporal lobe epilepsy (MTLE). Patients with MTLE often have extensive scarring in the hippocampus, a brain region responsible for memory that lies deep within a bigger region called the temporal lobe. Hippocampal scarring and MTLE are associated with a history of fever-induced fits, and HHV-6B infection can cause such fits in young children. Most people become infected with HHV-6B (or the closely related HHV-6A) early in life. The virus then remains latent for years within the brain and elsewhere. Given these facts and a previous investigation that showed that brain tissue from several patients with MTLE contained HHV-6B, the researchers reasoned that it was worth investigating HHV-6B as a cause of MTLE.</p></sec><sec id="sb1c"><title>What Did the Researchers Do and Find?</title><p>The researchers first looked for HHV-6B DNA in brain tissue surgically removed from patients with MTLE or another type of epilepsy. Tissue from 11 of 16 patients with MTLE (but from 0 of 7 control patients) contained HHV-6B DNA. When the researchers grew astrocytes (a type of brain cell) from some of these samples, only those from HHV-6B DNA-positive samples from patients with MTLE expressed an HHV-6-specific protein. Next, the researchers investigated in detail a patient with MTLE who had four sequential operations to control his epilepsy. This patient's hippocampus, which was removed in his first operation, contained a higher level of HHV-6B DNA than the tissues removed in later operations. After the fourth operation (which removed half of his brain and cured his epilepsy), astrocytes grown from the temporal lobe and the frontal/parietal lobe (a brain region next to the temporal lobe) but not the frontal and occipital lobes contained HHV-6B DNA and expressed a viral protein. The researchers also measured the production by these various astrocytes of a substance that moves glutamate (an amino acid that also acts as a neurotransmitter) across cell membranes&#x02014;MTLE has been associated with a glutamate transporter deficiency. Consistent with this, astrocytes from the patient's temporal lobe made no glutamate transporter mRNA (mRNA is an essential precursor for protein to be produced). Finally, infection of astrocytes isolated from a patient without MTLE with HHV-6B greatly reduced expression of glutamate transporter in these astrocytes.</p></sec><sec id="sb1d"><title>What Do These Findings Mean?</title><p>These findings, together with those from the previous study, reveal that nearly two-thirds of patients with MTLE (but no patients with other forms of epilepsy) have an active HHV-6B infection in the brain region where their epilepsy originates. Overall, they provide strong support for the idea that HHV-6B infections might cause MTLE, particularly given the results obtained from the patient whose condition only improved after multiple brain operations had removed all the virally infected material. Furthermore, the demonstration that HHV-6B infection reduces glutamate transporter expression in astrocytes suggests that HHV-6B infection might cause astrocyte dysfunction. This dysfunction could lead to injury of the sensitive neurons in the hippocampus and trigger MTLE. Additional patients now need to be studied both to confirm the association between HHV-6B infection and MTLE and to discover exactly how this virus triggers epilepsy.</p></sec><sec id="sb1e"><title>Additional Information.</title><p>Please access these Web sites via the online version of this summary at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0040180">http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0040180</ext-link>.</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>MedlinePlus encyclopedia page on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000694.htm">epilepsy</ext-link> (in English and Spanish)</p></list-item><list-item><p>World Health Organization <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs165/en/">fact sheet on epilepsy</ext-link> (in English, French, Spanish, Russian, Arabic, and Chinese)</p></list-item><list-item><p>US National Institute for Neurological Disorders and Stroke <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/epilepsy/epilepsy.htm">epilepsy information page</ext-link> (in English and Spanish)</p></list-item><list-item><p>UK National Health Service Direct <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nhsdirect.com/articles/article.aspx?articleId=155">information for patients on epilepsy</ext-link> (in several languages)</p></list-item><list-item><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/neurok.html">Neuroscience for kids</ext-link>, an educational Web site prepared by Eric Chudler (University of Washington, Seattle, Washington, United States), who also has a site that includes information on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/epi.html">epilepsy and a list of links to epilepsy organizations</ext-link> (mainly in English but some sections in other languages as well)</p></list-item><list-item><p>A short scientific <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/EID/vol5no3/campadelli.htm">article on human herpes virus 6</ext-link> in the journal <italic>Emerging Infectious Diseases</italic></p></list-item></list></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Fotheringham J, Donati D, Akhyani N, Fogdell-Hahn A, Vortmeyer A, et al.

Complex partial seizures were characterized were characterized by anxiety and repetition of a short verbal phrase, followed by staring and aphemia with preserved comprehension. Initial EEG showed left-sided slowing; MRI showed left temporal fullness and increased T2 signal. Cerebrospinal fluid revealed no red and three white cells, a protein of 13, and glucose of 77 mg/100 ml. Despite negative PCR for herpes, acyclovir was started. Seizures persisted despite eight antiepileptic drugs, steroids, IVIG, ganciclovir, and a vagal nerve stimulator. EEG showed left temporal periodic epileptiform discharges and left frontal and right sharp waves. A left mesial temporal lobectomy led to transient improvement, but within 2 mo seizure frequency approached baseline levels with semiology unchanged. MRI was unchanged, and there were no focal neurological findings. Invasive monitoring revealed left mid/posterior superior temporal gyrus seizure onset. After resection, frequent electrographic and clinical seizures arose from inferior and middle temporal gyrus and frontal lobe.

Although HHV-6 reactivation in the brain appears to occur predominately in immunosuppressed adults and is associated with neurological complications following bone marrow and stem cell transplantation, viral reactivation may also play a role in disorders such as multiple sclerosis and epilepsy. Several studies have demonstrated the presence of low levels HHV-6 DNA (typically nested PCR) in normal human brains that can range between a frequency of 0&#x00025;&#x02013;75&#x00025; &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040180-b015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040180-b037">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040180-b040">40</xref>&#x0005d;. These discrepancies can be attributed to different patient populations, methods of detection, and sensitivities and specificities of reagents. Studies demonstrating HHV-6 DNA in the normal human brain have typically used nested PCR, indicating that levels of viral DNA are low, supporting the observations by Blumberg et al. that HHV-6 may be present as a latent commensal pathogen that is able to infect the human brain without causing any apparent neurological disease &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040180-b041">41</xref>&#x0005d;.

A history of febrile seizures may be difficult to establish retrospectively, many years after the event. In our overall cohort of 38 patients, which represents our collective experience at NIH and the CNMC (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pmed-0040180-t002">Table 2</xref>), five of nine patients with a definite history of febrile seizures (all in the MTS-MTLE group), compared with nine of 28 reporting no history of febrile seizures, were positive for HHV-6B (a clear history could not be obtained for one HHV-6B&#x02013;positive patient with MTS-MTLE), suggesting a trend towards HHV-6B&#x02013;positive patients with MTLE having febrile seizure history. The long latency between childhood febrile seizures and the appearance of persistent unprovoked seizures suggests these patients may have chronic HHV-6 infection rather than reactivated virus. The presence of chronic viral infection in these patients would be supported by the progression of hippocampal atrophy. Collectively, these data suggest an ongoing process; the latency between occurrence of an early risk factor such as febrile seizures and onset of chronic epilepsy is consistent with either persistent or reactivated infection &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040180-b025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040180-b032">32</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>We also had the unique opportunity to follow longitudinally a patient who experienced recurrent seizures after three focal resections and a hemispherectomy for a period of 11 mo. Consistent detection of high levels of HHV-6B DNA in each of the three resections and in frontal and temporal/parietal lobes following hemispherectomy suggests this patient had a persistent and widespread infection with HHV-6B. Following hemispherectomy, this patient has been seizure-free without anticonvulsant treatment for more than 1 y. It is intriguing to speculate that these data demonstrate a widespread and persistent HHV-6 infection that was associated with epilepsy, and that once the viral infection was removed, the patient became seizure-free.</p><p>An association between chronic epilepsy and persistent or reactivated HHV-6 infection of astrocytes suggests the possibility that viral infection of astrocytes are associated with changes in cell function that may contribute to disease.

A unique finding in this study is the isolation ex vivo of cultured astrocytes from patients with MTLE who are infected with HHV-6. These primary HHV-6&#x02013;infected astrocytes demonstrated low levels of EAAT-2 mRNA. In support of our ex vivo findings, astrocytes infected with HHV-6 in vitro also demonstrated a remarkable decrease in EAAT-2 mRNA. Detection of high levels of HHV-6 DNA in MTLE brain tissue, isolation of HHV-6 from primary astrocytes isolated from MTLE brain tissue, and decreased expression of EAAT-2 mRNA demonstrates an association between HHV-6 infection and astrocytic dysfunction. Functional changes in virus infected glia or in glia harboring reactivated virus may lead to secondary injury of the exquisitely sensitive hippocampal neuron, and ultimately to development of MTLE and epilepsy. The potential relationship between HHV-6 astrocytic infection and MTLE deserves further investigation.</p><p>Overall, our cumulative experience at the NIH Clinical Center and the CNMC consists of a large cohort of patients with epilepsy, from which 60&#x00025; with clinically defined MTLE had detectable HHV-6B sequences in surgical brain resections. The highest HHV-6 viral loads were demonstrated in the hippocampus. This appeared to be specific for MTLE, since non-MTLE epilepsy material had no detectable levels of HHV-6 DNA by TaqMan or nested PCR. The statistically significant correlation of HHV-6 and MTLE (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pmed-0040180-t002">Table 2</xref>) in a large cohort of patients with epilepsy and dysregulation of glutamate transporter expression by HHV-6 suggests a novel pathophysiological mechanism of disease.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pmed-0040180-sg001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><title>Primary Astrocytes Isolated and Cultured from HHV-6B&#x02013;Positive MTLE Brain Resections Express Viral DNA and Antigen</title><p>Primary astrocytes were isolated from fresh brain material obtained during epilepsy brain resection.</p><p>(A) Cells were cultured for 3&#x02013;4 wk and stained for GFAP (green), DAPI (blue; nuclei), and the nonvariant specific HHV-6 antigen gp116/54/64 (red).
