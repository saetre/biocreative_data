Here we provide novel evidence that galectin-4 is selectively expressed and secreted by intestinal epithelial cells and binds potently to activated peripheral and mucosal lamina propria T-cells at the CD3 epitope. The carbohydrate-dependent binding of galectin-4 at the CD3 epitope is fully functional and inhibited T cell activation, cycling and expansion. Galectin-4 induced apoptosis of activated peripheral and mucosal lamina propria T cells via calpain-, but not caspase-dependent, pathways. Providing further evidence for its important role in regulating T cell function, galectin-4 blockade by antisense oligonucleotides reduced TNF-alpha inhibitor induced T cell death. Furthermore, in T cells, galectin-4 reduced pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion including IL-17. In a model of experimental colitis, galectin-4 ameliorated mucosal inflammation, induced apoptosis of mucosal T-cells and decreased the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Our results show that galectin-4 plays a unique role in the intestine and assign a novel role of this protein in controlling intestinal inflammation by a selective induction of T cell apoptosis and cell cycle restriction. Conclusively, after defining its biological role, we propose Galectin-4 is a novel anti-inflammatory agent that could be therapeutically effective in diseases with a disturbed T cell expansion and apoptosis such as inflammatory bowel disease.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Although the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) is not fully understood, it is evident that both Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are linked to a failure of the mucosal immune system and that both an unrestricted expansion and an impaired apoptosis of T cells foster mucosal inflammation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002629-Fiocchi1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002629-Strober1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

Similar to Gal-1, but in contrast to Gal-2, CD3 was detected after affinity fractionation of extract with immobilized Gal-4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002629-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>).

Dead cells were excluded for further cell cycle analysis by proper gating on the respective DNA content. As demonstrated by flow cytometry analysis, Gal-4 significantly inhibited expression of the co-stimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86 expression on PBMC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002629-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>).

Of note, 100 &#x000b5;g/ml Gal-4 did not activate T cells in the absence of concurrent CD3 stimulation (not shown). T cell activation initiates cell cycling, a complexly regulated movement through different phases. Thus, we tested the effect of Gal-4 on PBT cell cycling separately for every cell cycle phase. The analysis of cyclin A, regulating the S-phase, and cyclin B1, propelling the cells from late G2 to mitosis, was measured in conjunction with propidium iodide (PI) staining to exactly localize its increase within the cell cycle and to exclude dead cells.

Using the same experimental design as above, we transfected PBT with specific Gal-4 antisense to investigate the role of endogenous Gal-4. Gal-4 expression was inhibited by 49&#x000b1;7&#x00025;. Interestingly, in contrast to the lack of Gal-4 antisense to interfere with the T cell cycle, blockade of Gal-4 expression increased TNF-&#x003b1; secretion of activated T cells by 86.0&#x000b1;9&#x00025; and IL-6 secretion by 23.0&#x000b1;3&#x00025;. Next, we investigated the effect of Gal-4 on the cytokine secretion profile of CD2-stimulated LPT.

Nevertheless, little information is available about the functional role of galectins during mucosal inflammation, where a disturbed innate and adaptive immune system triggers local and systemic inflammation.</p><p>Gal-1 is so far the best investigated member of the galectin family and Santucci and coworkers demonstrated that the proto-type galectin Gal-1 suppresses experimental colitis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002629-Santucci1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. However, Gal-1 is constitutively expressed in most organs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002629-Rabinovich1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, showing that Gal-1 broadly, but also nonspecifically, interact with the immune system. In contrast, the tandem-repeat type Gal-4 is exclusively expressed within the GI tract which suggests that Gal-4 might play a more defined and selective role within the intestinal mucosa, prompting us to investigate the role of Gal-4 in mucosal inflammatory processes.</p><p>By performing sequential immunohistochemical analysis, we showed strong Gal-4 expression in epithelial cells along the alimentary tract and thus confirmed the previously described RNA expression profile <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002629-Nio1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Additionally, we demonstrated that Gal-4 is secreted by intestinal epithelial cell lines, a pre-requirement to interact with the underlying cells of the lamina propria. T cell dysfunction is undoubtedly a key feature in the initiation and perpetuation of IBD and by demonstrating that Gal-4 binds to activated peripheral and mucosal T cells, we set ground to further investigate the role of Gal-4 in the adaptive immune system. Interestingly, our finding that Gal-4 binds only to activated, but not resting T cells, might explain the recently described phenomena by Hokama et al., that the reactivity of CD4&#x0002b; T cells to Gal-4 is only elicited under inflammatory conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002629-Hokama1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. The selective binding patterns of Gal-4 suggested that Gal-4 binding sides might be associated with surface regions involved in the activation of T cells and in deed, Hokama et al. reported that Gal-4 binds to CD4&#x0002b; T cells at the immunological synapse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002629-Hokama1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>.

Thus, the binding of extracellular Gal-4 to this complex or a tightly associated glycoprotein as major target implies that Gal-4 is capable of modulating central T cell functions. The strong down-regulation of CD25 expression of CD3-activated T cells by Gal-4 proves the biological consequence of the Gal-4 binding to the CD3 complex. Performing a detailed analysis of essential cell cycle checkpoints, we revealed that the restricted activation of T cells by Gal-4 is carried through the whole cell cycle and finally results in a declined mitosis and expansion of the respective T cell population. Proving the concept that the binding of extracellular Gal-4 is linked to the capacity of Gal-4 to inhibit cell cycling, blockade of endogenous Gal-4, which is not linked to the CD3 complex, failed to modulate T cell cycling.</p><p>T cell cycling and cytokine secretion are ultimately linked <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002629-Richter1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>.
