We globally identified the promoters occupied by SREBP1 and its binding partners NFY and SP1 in a human hepatocyte cell line using chromatin immunoprecipitation combined with genome tiling arrays (ChIP-chip). We find that SREBP1 occupies the promoters of 1,141 target genes involved in diverse biological pathways, including novel targets with roles in lipid metabolism and insulin signaling. We also identify a conserved SREBP1 DNA-binding motif in SREBP1 target promoters, and we demonstrate that many SREBP1 target genes are transcriptionally activated by treatment with insulin and glucose using gene expression microarrays. Finally, we show that SREBP1 cooperates extensively with NFY and SP1 throughout the genome and that unique combinations of these factors target distinct functional pathways. Our results provide insight into the regulatory circuitry in which SREBP1 and its network partners coordinate a complex transcriptional response in the liver with cues from the diet.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Transcription factors (TFs) are DNA-binding proteins that regulate the transcription of their target genes. TFs typically bind in proximity to the transcription start sites of their target genes in a region called the promoter. SREBP1 is a TF that increases the transcription of numerous genes involved in cholesterol and fat metabolism and has been linked to diet-related diseases such as insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Using microarray technology, we identified all of the promoters in the human genome that are bound by SREBP1 and two associated TFs called NFY and SP1 in a human liver cell line. Our findings greatly expand the number of genes and biological pathways that may be regulated by SREBP1 and reveal that different combinations of SREBP1 and its partners preferentially target genes involved in different pathways. Thus, in contrast to traditional studies that focus on individual genes, we have used a genomics approach to provide a novel global view of the regulatory circuitry in which SREBP1 and its partners coordinate a transcriptional response in the liver with cues from the diet.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="9"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The transcription factor SREBP1 is a key regulator of the transcription of numerous genes that function in the metabolism of cholesterol and fatty acids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000133-Horton1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

The de novo synthesis of fatty acids (lipogenesis) in the liver is induced by the insulin signaling pathway. Numerous studies based on the analysis of single genes have demonstrated that SREBP1 upregulates the transcription of lipogenic genes, primarily through the insulin-responsive SREBP1c isoform which predominates in the liver <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000133-Horton1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Although these studies have identified a number of important lipogenic genes that are regulated by SREBP1, our understanding of the targets of SREBP1 involved in lipid metabolism is incomplete and the role of SREBP1 in other pathways that may contribute to diet-related disease states is poorly understood. Furthermore, our understanding of the manner in which SREBP1 selects and regulates its target genes in combination with other transcriptional regulators is limited.</p><p>In the present study, we sought to further understand the function of SREBP1 and how it operates with other regulators by globally mapping its target genes and those of its associated factors NFY and SP1 in human hepatocarcinoma (HepG2) cells using ChIP-chip. In addition, we sought to correlate SREBP1 occupation with changes in gene expression induced under conditions in which SREBP1 is activated and repressed. The overall scheme is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000133-g001">Figure 1A</xref>.</p><fig id="pgen-1000133-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1000133.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Study design and ChIP enrichment at representative SREBP1-occupied promoters.</title><p>A) Overall scheme to identify targets of SREBP1, NFY, and SP1 in HepG2 cells and to investigate the regulation of SREBP1 targets under opposing nutrient conditions.

Therefore, to identify the complete repertoire of hepatic SREBP1 target genes using ChIP-chip, we treated HepG2 cells with insulin and glucose&#x02014;conditions that mimic the high-carbohydrate refeeding response. We then performed chromatin immunoprecipitation with a well-characterized antibody that recognizes both SREBP1 isoforms due to their nearly identical primary structure. Since both isoforms are present in the nucleus under these conditions, the binding profiles generated include targets of both SREBP1a and SREBP1c.

This type of analysis is important for expanding our currently limited understanding of how transcriptional regulatory networks are organized into functional modules in mammalian genomes. Identification of enriched GO categories using BiNGO <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000133-Maere1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref> revealed that different combinations of these regulators display distinct preferences for genes involved in certain biological pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000133-g004">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000133.s012">Table S9</xref>). In some cases, these pathways were targeted by a unique combination of regulators. For example, genes involved in lipid metabolism, including important lipogenic genes such as stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1, were preferentially occupied by the combination of SREBP1 and NFY (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;2.4&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup>). Likewise, genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;1.5&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>) and cellular respiration (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;2.5&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>), key nutrient-regulated pathways, were enriched among targets of SREBP1 alone, indicating that SREBP1 may cooperate with regulators other than NFY and SP1 at the promoters of these genes. In some cases, however, one biological pathway was targeted by multiple combinations of regulators. For example, genes encoding cholesterol biosynthetic enzymes were enriched among targets of all three regulators (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;3.0&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;6</sup>) and among targets of both SREBP1 and NFY (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;3.9&#x000d7;10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup>). This type of configuration may reflect differences among genes in the same pathway, such as their timing or responsiveness to different stimuli. Additional representative enriched categories for each combination of regulators are displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000133-g004">Figure 4C</xref>. It will be of interest to determine how SREBP1 participates in the control of different biological pathways in combination with a wider array of transcriptional regulators in the liver by performing location analysis for additional factors, especially those that participate in nutrient-regulated pathways, such as SREBP2, LXR&#x003b1;, PPAR&#x003b1;, and ChREBP.</p><p>In conclusion, these studies present the first global analysis of targets of an important set of regulators involved in mammalian lipid metabolism. The targets of SREBP1 are involved in a wide array of cellular processes suggesting new and expanded roles for this transcription factor. In addition, many of these targets are differentially regulated in the fasted and refed states, suggesting that they respond to changes in the diet. Finally, we find that SREBP1 and its associated factors NFY and SP1 form an interconnected regulatory circuit and bind in a combinatorial manner to functionally distinct sets of target genes.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s3"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Cell Culture</title><p>HepG2 cells were routinely cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10&#x00025; FBS and 100 U/ml penicillin/streptomycin.
