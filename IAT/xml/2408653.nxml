In turn, they have increased precursor structures GM3 and GD3, probably replacing the roles of the depleted complex gangliosides. In this study, we found that 9-<italic>O</italic>-acetyl GD3 is also highly expressed as one of the major glycosphingolipids accumulating in the nervous tissues of the mutant mice. The identity of the novel component was confirmed by neuraminidase treatment, thin layer chromatography-immunostaining, two-dimensional thin layer chromatography with base treatment, and mass spectrometry. All candidate factors reported to be possible inducer of 9-<italic>O</italic>- acetylation, such as bitamine D binding protein, acetyl CoA transporter, or <italic>O</italic>-acetyl ganglioside synthase were not up-regulated. Tis21 which had been reported to be a 9-<italic>O</italic>-acetylation inducer was partially down-regulated in the null mutants, suggesting that Tis21 is not involved in the induction of 9-<italic>O</italic>-acetyl-GD3 and that accumulated high amount of GD3 might be the main factor for the dramatic increase of 9-<italic>O</italic>-acetyl GD3. The ability to acetylate exogenously added GD3 in the normal mouse astrocytes was examined, showing that the wild-type brain might be able to synthesize very low levels of 9-<italic>O</italic>-acetyl GD3. Increased 9-<italic>O</italic>-acetyl GD3, in addition to GM3 and GD3, may play an important role in the compensation for deleted complex gangliosides in the mutant mice.</p><p><italic>J.

Recently, many attempts have been made to identify the gene without success, suggesting that a single gene product may not be able to catalyze the 9-<italic>O</italic>-acetylation of sialic acids. These attempts resulted in the identification of a putative acetyl-CoA transporter (named AT-1) cDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Kanamori <italic>et al.</italic> 1997</xref>) or of a cDNA for a novel transcriptional factor (or AGS, <italic>O</italic>-acetyl ganglioside synthase) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Ogura <italic>et al.</italic> 1996</xref>).

Thus, 9-<italic>O</italic>-acetyl GD3 was found in some of human melanomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">Cheresh <italic>et al.</italic> 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">Ritter <italic>et al.</italic> 1990</xref>) and basal cell sarcomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Fahr and Schauer 2001</xref>), suggesting this structure is involved in cancer evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">Schauer and Kamerling 1997</xref>;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Angata and Varki 2002</xref>), though no direct evidence has been shown. On the otherhand, 9-<italic>O</italic>-acetylation in influenza C protein transgenic mice resulted in the arrest of cell division at the early stage of development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">Varki <italic>et al.</italic> 1991</xref>).</p><p>7(9)-<italic>O</italic>-acetyltransferase, the enzyme responsible for the acetylation of gangliosides was first detected in bovine submandibular glands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">Schauer 1970</xref>). Recently, many trials have been performed to identify the gene mainly by expression cloning system, resulting in failure. These results suggest that a single gene product may not be able to catalyze the reaction of 9-<italic>O</italic>-acetylation onto sialic acids or sialic acid-nucleotides. Thus, the regulatory mechanisms for the synthesis of <italic>O</italic>-acetylated sialic acids is not well understood because of the unavailability of the cDNA of the enzyme coding 9-<italic>O</italic>-acetylase. The active form may exist as a molecular complex of several components.</p><p>In the mutant mice of GM2/GD2 synthase gene, 9-<italic>O</italic>-acetyl GD3 is expressed at an extremely high level. In the early reports, gangliosides were isolated via alkaline treatment, resulting in the elimination of <italic>O</italic>-acetyl compounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Fig. 1a</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Takamiya <italic>et al.</italic> 1996</xref>). Here, we demonstrated the identity of the new band using multiple approaches. First of all, the component was sialidase-resistant, while two major bands were completely digested and converted to lactosylceramide. Second, the band was specifically detected by an anti-9-<italic>O</italic>-acetyl GD3 mAb in TLC-immunostaining. Third, the component showed altered migration in TLC after alkaline treatment, resulting in the identical migration with that of GD3. Fourth, mass spectrometry of the component revealed that it contained <italic>O</italic>-acetyl base in GD3. Taken together, the unknown band found in the brain tissues from the mutant mice turned out to be 9-<italic>O</italic>-acetyl GD3.</p><p>Mechanisms for the neo-synthesis of 9-<italic>O</italic>-acetyl GD3 in the mutant mice were analyzed by examining the changes in the expression levels of mRNAs for genes that had been reported to be associated with 9-<italic>O</italic>-acetyl GD3. Rat AGS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Ogura <italic>et al.</italic> 1996</xref>) containing high homology with mouse fat globule membrane protein was cloned by expression cloning using GD3 synthase-transfected CHO cells, and was considered as a putative <italic>O</italic>-acetyltransferase. This gene was reported to be up-regulated in stellate cells during liver fibrogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">Lee <italic>et al.</italic> 2003</xref>). AT-1 was also isolated by expression cloning as a membrane protein required for the formation of <italic>O</italic>-acetylated gangliosides, and concluded to be a putative acetyl-CoA transporter gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Kanamori <italic>et al.</italic> 1997</xref>). Shi <italic>et al.</italic> also isolated cDNA clones by expression cloning using CHE-FcD as a detection probe, and identified that one of them was vit-D bp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">Shi <italic>et al.</italic> 1988</xref>). This could induce 9-<italic>O</italic>-acetylation on COS cells expressing &#x003b1;2,6-linked sialic acids. As these authors pointed out, it is unlikely that the products of all these genes act as an <italic>O</italic>-acetyltransferase. Recently, Satake <italic>et al.</italic> reported that GD3-specific 9-<italic>O</italic>-acetyltransferase was induced by Tis21, expression of which was enhanced by the transfection of GD3 synthase cDNA into CHO cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Satake <italic>et al.</italic> 2002</xref>). They concluded that GD3 expression triggered Tis21 expression. This hypothesis was confirmed here in the mutant mice exhibiting accumulation of GD3 as well as GM3, and this seemed not the case in the mutant mice. In the RT-PCR, none of mRNAs examined showed significant up-regulation. Surprisingly, Tis21 showed rather a reduced level in the mutant mice, suggesting that high expression of 9-<italic>O</italic>-acetyl GD3 suppressed the Tis21 expression probably as a feed back inhibition.</p><p>Accumulation of the precursor GD3 might be a crucial factor in the enhanced synthesis of 9-<italic>O</italic>-acetyl GD3, and the synthetic activity itself (9-<italic>O</italic>-acetylransferase) might not be changed, although no definite evidence could be shown. The results of TLC-immunostaining with WT mouse brain extracts suggested that even WT mice could synthesize 9-<italic>O</italic>-acetyl-GD3, though at an extremely low level. Martin <italic>et al.</italic> reported that specific sialyltransferases influence the <italic>in vivo</italic> regulation of <italic>O</italic>-acetylation, i.e., loss of <italic>O</italic>-acetylation in ST6GalI and ST3GalI null mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Martin <italic>et al.</italic> 2002</xref>). This seems quite reasonable, because these enzymes are indispensable to synthesize the precursors or acceptors of the <italic>O</italic>-acetylation. By analogy, accumulation of GD3, the precursor of 9-<italic>O</italic>-acetyl GD3, could lead to the neo-synthesis of 9-<italic>O</italic>-acetyl GD3 based on its high level in the mutant mice of GM2/GD2 synthase.</p><p>Since over-expression of GD3 might have induced Tis21 gene expression, leading to the induction of 9-<italic>O</italic>-acetylation of GD3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">Satake <italic>et al.</italic> 2002</xref>), Tis21 expression in GD3 synthase KO mice was examined to clarify whether GD3 is essential for the induction of Tis21. Contrary to expectation, Tis21 mRNA levels were not altered in the GD3 synthase KO mice, indicating that Tis21 mRNA was not affected even in the absence of GD3. Exogenously added GD3 was reported to induce <italic>O</italic>-acetyltransferase in CHO cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">Chen <italic>et al.</italic> 2006</xref>). Whether neo-expression of 9-<italic>O</italic>-acetyl GD3 is really dependent on the neo-expression of an <italic>O</italic>-acetyltransferase because of GD3 or the accumulation of GD3 merely prompts the synthesis of 9-<italic>O</italic>-acetyl GD3 remains to be investigated. It seems more likely that <italic>O</italic>-acetylase was induced directly or indirectly by the high levels of GD3 regardless of Tis21, or the existing level of <italic>O</italic>-acetylase was sufficient to increase 9-<italic>O</italic>-acetyl GD3 levels in the presence of huge amount of GD3. At least we can conclude that Tis21 is probably not an inducing factor of such an <italic>O</italic>-acetyltransferase in GM2/GD2 synthase KO mice.</p><p>As Chen reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3"><italic>Chen et al.</italic> 2006</xref>), it might be possible that accumulated GD3 induced synthetic machinery of 9-<italic>O</italic>-acetyl-GD3 in the KO mice. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig09">Fig. 9 and 10</xref> together with the results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Fig. 4</xref>, low levels of 9-<italic>O</italic>-acetyl-GD3 were already found in the WT mouse brain. Therefore, it seems reasonable that the expression of 9-<italic>O</italic>-acetyl-GD3 in the KO mouse brain became overt because of the increased synthesis based on the increased precursor structure.</p><p>Although 9-<italic>O</italic>-acetyl GD3 or 9-<italic>O</italic>-acetylated sialic acid-containing mucins have been considered to be involved in the malignant features of tumor cells, their roles in cell proliferation and invasion have not been clearly demonstrated. A significant role for the <italic>O</italic>-acetylation of GD3 in the induction of apoptosis has also been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Malisan <italic>et al.</italic> 2002</xref>). However, it is not clear whether modulation of GD3 is important or 9-<italic>O</italic>-acetyl sialic acid itself has a unique function. The mutant mice lacking complex gangliosides showed much milder phenotypes than expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">Takamiya <italic>et al.</italic> 1996</xref>). Accumulation of GM3 and GD3 was considered to compensate the functions of the lost structures, and to attenuate the morphological and functional defects because of the lack of the complex gangliosides. Neo-synthesis of 9-<italic>O</italic>-acetyl GD3 might also play an important role in the attenuation of the abnormal phenotypes of GM2/GD2 synthase KO mice. In fact, 9-<italic>O</italic>-acetyl GD3 was appeared to participate in neuronophilic as well as gliophilic migration of subventricular zone explants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Miyakoshi <italic>et al.</italic> 2001</xref>), and granule cell migration in the developing cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">Santiago <italic>et al.</italic> 2001</xref>), suggesting its roles in the protection of neuronal death or reconstruction of the degenerated nervous system in the KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">Sugiura <italic>et al.</italic> 2005</xref>). In order to investigate these mechanisms, it seems critical to define the enzyme and other essential molecules responsible for the <italic>O</italic>-acetylation of sialic acids.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank T.
