All the above are serotype O1, whereas environmental or invertebrate isolates are antigenically diverse. The pre 7th pandemic isolates mentioned above, and other minor pathogenic clones, are related to the 7<sup>th</sup> pandemic clone, while the 6<sup>th</sup> pandemic clone is in the same lineage but more distantly related, and non-pathogenic isolates show no clonal structure. To understand the origins and relationships of the pandemic clones, we sequenced the genomes of a 1937 prepandemic strain and a 6<sup>th</sup> pandemic isolate, and compared them with the published 7<sup>th</sup> pandemic genome. We distinguished mutational and recombinational events, and allocated these and other events, to specific branches in the evolutionary tree. There were more mutational than recombinational events, but more genes, and 44 times more base pairs, changed by recombination. We used the mutational single-nucleotide polymorphisms and known isolation dates of the prepandemic and 7<sup>th</sup> pandemic isolates to estimate the mutation rate, and found it to be 100 fold higher than usually assumed. We then used this to estimate the divergence date of the 6<sup>th</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> pandemic clones to be about 1880. While there is a large margin of error, this is far more realistic than the 10,000&#x02013;50,000 years ago estimated using the usual assumptions. We conclude that the 2 pandemic clones gained pandemic potential independently, and overall there were 29 insertions or deletions of one or more genes. There were also substantial changes in the major integron, attributed to gain of individual cassettes including copying from within, or loss of blocks of cassettes. The approaches used open up new avenues for analysing the origin and history of other important pathogens.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cholera was recognised in accounts from ancient India and China <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004053-Blake1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, but it was only in 1817 that an epidemic in India spread westwards to become the first of 7 pandemics. The etiological agent of pandemic cholera was the bacterium <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic> serotype O1, which was later divided into two biotypes: classical biotype and El Tor biotype. The first six pandemics were caused by the classical biotype, but in the early 1900s a new form of the species emerged that caused mild or no symptoms, and was later put into the El Tor biotype, to distinguish it from the form causing cholera (classical biotype). The El Tor biotype differed by being haemolytic, and positive in the Voges Proskaur reaction that detects a specific fermentation pathway. The 6<sup>th</sup> pandemic continued until 1923, but from then on was largely confined to Asia (and thus not pandemic). The 7<sup>th</sup> pandemic, which erupted in 1961, was El Tor in biotype, which was quite unexpected. However there had been several outbreaks of cholera, now known as pre-7<sup>th</sup> pandemic outbreaks, in the Makassar area, Sulawesi, Indonesia between 1937 and 1957. The organism was El Tor but the disease resembled true cholera in severity and mortality. It differed in not spreading rapidly but remained localised as reported in a review soon after the events <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004053-Mukerjee1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. The 7<sup>th</sup> pandemic (also El Tor) arose in the same area, and is generally thought to have arisen from the Makassar outbreak strain. It spread rapidly and eventually fully replaced the classical biotype 6<sup>th</sup> pandemic strain, which was present in India throughout the period between the 6<sup>th</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> pandemics and for many years after the 7<sup>th</sup> pandemic arrived (see also Supporting Introduction in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004053.s001">Text S1</xref>).</p><p><italic>V. cholerae</italic> has also been found in water, particularly brackish water, and associated sediments, and also on invertebrates in these habitats. These environmental isolates are phenotypically very diverse with over 200 serotypes reported. They resemble the El Tor biotype, but the term is not used as the biotyping is confined to serotype 1. The fact that the 6<sup>th</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> pandemics are of different biotype, with the 7<sup>th</sup> pandemic strain more similar to environmental isolates than the 6<sup>th</sup>, suggests that the 7<sup>th</sup> pandemic strain did not arise from the 6<sup>th</sup> pandemic but arose independently.</p><p>We have already looked at the relationships of the pathogenic strains using sequence of 26 house keeping genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004053-Salim1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. This confirmed earlier conclusions from several groups, based on MLEE and sequence data, that the 6<sup>th</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> pandemic clones, the pre 7<sup>th</sup> pandemic outbreak isolates, and some other pathogenic strains are related. However with 26 genes and 12 isolates an unambiguous tree was obtained, with no reverse or parallel events. It was also clear that the 6<sup>th</sup> pandemic clone stands apart from the other pathogenic strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004053-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Single base change mutational and multi bases change recombinational events could be distinguished, and this showed that there has been extensive recombination, with 8 of the 26 genes having undergone recombination in either 6<sup>th</sup> or 7<sup>th</sup> pandemic lineage since divergence. A 1937 Makassar outbreak isolate (strain M66-2) appeared to be on the direct line to the 7<sup>th</sup> pandemic. The picture that we have for <italic>V. cholerae</italic> is of a species that is diverse with as many O antigen forms as <italic>E. coli</italic>, with one lineage that has adapted to a new niche as an intestinal pathogen of humans. On at least 2 occasions this pathogenic form developed a high level of transmission to become pandemic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004053-Salim1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004053-Reeves1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><fig id="pone-0004053-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004053.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Relationships of M66-2, 6<sup>th</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> pandemic clones, and other closely related toxigenic strains based on 26 house keeping genes (Salim <italic>et al.</italic> 2005).</title><p>The relationships of the strains are identical to those in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004053-g002">Figure 2</xref> of Salim <italic>et al.</italic> (2005) but the tree is presented as phylogram as commonly used for easy interpretation.

We sequenced the genomes of strain M66-2, and 6<sup>th</sup> pandemic isolate O395, and compared them with the published genome of 7<sup>th</sup> pandemic isolate N16961. We describe a method to distinguish mutation from recombination-based changes over a full genome, and this provided the data to assess the rate of mutational change, as the 7<sup>th</sup> pandemic strain N16961 was isolated in 1971, and the 6<sup>th</sup> pandemic strain, O395, was isolated in 1965. Comparison of the genomes enables us to document the changes that had occurred during divergence of the three clones. Significant findings include an estimate for the mutation rate that is 100 times higher than generally assumed, a model for change in the major integron, and assessment of mutational, recombination, integron and other evolutionary events to the separate lineages.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="s2a"><title>General Genome Features and Genome Rearrangement</title><p>The <italic>V. cholerae</italic> M66-2 and O395 genomes were sequenced and, as expected for <italic>Vibrio</italic> genomes, both comprise a large and small chromosome.

Base changes outside these segments were treated as mutations, and each mutation or recombination event was allocated to the M66-2 lineage, the N16961 lineage, or to the divergence between the joint M66-2/N16961 lineage and the O395 lineage (the O/NM divergence), as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0004053-t001">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004053-g002">Figure 2B</xref>. We also showed that recombinant segments were randomly distributed in the M66-2 and N16961 lineages, and those attributed to the O/MN divergence are probably also randomly distributed, but there is some distortion probably because with 32&#x00025; of the genome affected, some recombinant segments overlap (see Supporting Methods in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004053.s001">Text S1</xref>). It can be seen that there were far more recombination and mutation events during the O/NM divergence, than in either M66-2 or N16961 lineage, and also that M66-2 had undergone significant change. There is no genome sequence suitable for use as an outgroup to allocate events to the O or MN lineages, as examination of a series of genes shows that there has been extensive recombination, such that individual gene trees are not congruent and not useful for analysis of strain relationships. However for the 368 mutational changes we can ask if that particular base has undergone any change in the genome sequences that we have for comparison, which are in effect a complex array of lineages reassorted by recombination, as if not we can use that information in effect as an outgroup. We took 5 genomes that are outside of the pathogenic lineage under study, and for each of the mutational SNPs in the O/MN divergence, determined the base present in these strains. Of the sites the base present was same in all 5 genomes, and was either the base found in the O395 genome or that in both N16961 and M66-2. On this basis we allocated most of these changes to either the O or MN lineage. For some sites the sequence segment involved was not present in any of the outgroup strains, while for others it was not sufficiently consistent to enable us to determine the lineage.

The number of mutations that would have occurred if the rate had been the same in recombinant segments as elsewhere is 740 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0004053-t001">Table 1</xref>). If we assume that half of the additional substitutions would have occurred before recombination and thus lost, we have 24800 of the observed substitutions due to recombination and 647 due to mutation, indicating that there have been 38 times as many of the substitutions observed due to recombination than to mutation.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Pseudogenes Accumulated During Development of Pathogenicity</title><p>The distribution of pseudogenes is interesting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004053-g002">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004053.s011">Table S3</xref>). The common ancestor of the 3 strains must have had very few pseudogenes as there are only 6 common to the three genomes, but there are 53 cases of pseudogene formation during divergence. For pseudogenes we assume that in general the mutation in the lineage involved loss of function, and hence can attribute the pseudogene mutations that occurred during O/NM divergence to either the O or MN lineage. On this basis 30 occurred in the O395 lineage, 3 in the N16961/M66-2 common lineage, and 7 and 13 respectively in N16961 and M66-2 after their divergence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004053.s011">Table S3</xref>).</p><p>Most of those pseudogenes differ from the parent form only by a single frameshift mutation, or base change to give a stop codon. Also the 6 pseudogenes common to the 3 strains, are identical in all 3, except for VC0254 which has an additional indel in O395. Note that because even very low levels of sequencing error would affect these conclusions, the sequences for the regions involved were verified as discussed in Supporting Methods <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004053.s001">Text S1</xref>. Most pseudogenes are present in only one strain and <italic>a priori</italic> it is possible that the mutations involved occurred after strain isolation. We therefore looked at the sequence data for MO10, an O139 strain isolated in 1992, the first year in which that O139 variant of the 7<sup>th</sup> pandemic clone was observed, as it is a descendent of the O1 form of the 7<sup>th</sup> pandemic clone<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004053-Faruque1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, although N16961 may not be on the direct lineage.

The sequences are generally identical and it seems that they arose by duplication rather than independent transfer from other strains. There were other cassettes that were near identical for which the same applies, as some divergence by mutation is expected, and for the purposes of this analysis we consider both identical and near identical (less than 1&#x00025; sequence difference) cassettes to have arisen by duplication within the lineages under study. Treating these near identical cassettes as variants of the same form gives us a total of 207 cassette forms occupying the 271 locations.

M66-2, N16961 and O395 have blocks (A, B and C) of 40, 9 and 4 cassettes respectively at the 5&#x02032; end, that fit the pattern expected for cassettes added sequentially at <italic>attI</italic> since their divergence.

A phylogenetic analysis of the <italic>attC</italic> sites indicates that many of these cassettes were of foreign origin (details in Supporting Discussion <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004053.s001">Text S1</xref>).</p><p>However as discussed above many cassettes are present at more than one location. There are 39 cassettes are present in duplicate, and 6, 3 and 1 with 3, 4 or 5 copies respectively (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004053.s012">Table S4</xref>), all most easily explained by copying of pre-existing cassettes in the same integron. The details of this proposal are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004053-g005">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004053.s005">Figure S4</xref>. For these cassettes, most of the upstream (new) copies are separated as a group from most of the downstream (donor) copies, although there is overlap of the 2 regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004053-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). This pattern is assumed to reflect copying from downstream to upstream locations, as the only known mechanism for adding individual cassettes is at the upstream end of the integron. On this hypothesis 21 of the 40 cassettes in block A, proposed to have been added to M66-2 since divergence from N16961, were copied from downstream cassettes, one (M6) from another cassette in block A, 12 from cassettes still in M66-2, and 8 from cassettes in N16961 and presumably since lost in M66-2.</p><p>The original evidence was for excision of cassettes as circular DNA and integration at <italic>attI</italic>. It was shown that IntI can excise a cassette to give a circular form, and that this circular form can then be incorporated at the <italic>attI</italic> site, again by IntI, to give a new cassette downstream of <italic>attI</italic>, effectively transferring a cassette from one site to another. These experiments involved cassettes in different integrons, so gave no indication of the status of the donor integron after &#x0201c;excision&#x0201d;, but <italic>a priori</italic> did not provide a model for copying of a cassette while leaving the original intact. However under the current model for the action of IntI <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004053-Bouvier1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004053-MacDonald1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, the formation of the translocation intermediate involves only a single strand of the donor cassette, and it is entirely plausible that at the time of its removal as an IntI-associated folded single strand, it would be replaced by repair DNA synthesis on the complementary strand. This would generate the pattern that we observe if this IntI-associated copy were later inserted into the same integron. Indeed our observations provide support for such a model for generation of the IntI-associated recombination intermediate. There are alternative explanations for the copying process, such as copying from one fork to another after DNA replication, or by involvement of the chitin induced DNA transformation between cells of the same clone forming a biofilm on chitin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004053-Meibom1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004053-Miller1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. The latter paper showed that DNA released by one cell could be taken up by another in the biofilm. The experiments involved homologous recombination but any circular cassettes present would also be released, and if taken up could be incorporated at <italic>attI</italic>. If both donor and recipient were from the same &#x0201c;colony&#x0201d; in the biofilm, there would be duplication as inferred from the distribution of cassettes.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Twenty-nine Large Insertions and Deletions occurred during divergence of the 3 lineages</title><p>There are 29 insertions and deletions involving at least one gene, which we refer to as large indels to distinguish them from mutations involving one or few base pairs.

The colour codes are; orange, <italic>rtx</italic> toxin region; black, the 17 bp attRS sites; red, core region of the CTX phage; dark green, the RS1 (<italic>rstC, rstB, rstA, rstR</italic>) region of the CTX phage of N16961; light green, the RS2 (<italic>rstB</italic>, <italic>rstA</italic>, <italic>rstR</italic>) region of the CTX phage of N16961; purple, the divergent <italic>rstR</italic> gene of RS2 of O365; light blue, genes not related to CTX; dark blue, the 5-gene toxin-linked cryptic (TLC) element&#x02013;2&#x02013;3 copies in each strain. The first and second copies of TLC differ between N16961 and O395 by 2 and 3 SNPs respectively.

O395 also has a K139-like and 2 Mu-like phages. The CTX&#x003a6; is an indel because of its absence in M66-2, and an extra copy present on the small chromosome in O395, which is identical in sequence to that on the large chromosome.

The widely used Dykhuizen and Whittam divergence rates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004053-Guttman1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004053-Whittam1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref> gave 10,000 to 50,000 years for divergence of the two pandemic strains and 2,000 to 10,000 years for divergence of M66-2 and N16961 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004053.s014">Table S6</xref>). This takes us long before epidemiological records for pandemic cholera and is also not consistent with the Makassar outbreak being a precursor to the 7<sup>th</sup> pandemic.</p><p>However it has recently been shown that species that diverged less than about a million years ago have accumulated up to 10 fold more than the expected number of SNPs, as many of the mutations seen in intraspecies comparisons are later lost due to random genetic drift or purifying selection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004053-Ho1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004053-Ho2">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. With an accurate record of the history of these strains, and in the absence of any remaining basis for an externally based rate of divergence, we took the split between M66-2 (isolated in 1937) and N16961 (isolated in 1971) as the basis for assessing relative time frames. There have been 14 synonymous mutations in M66-2 since its divergence from N16961 compared with 47 for N16961. To calculate the divergence rate, we assumed the same rate of change from divergence to isolation in 1937 and 1971 respectively, which gave a rate of 0.97 SNPs/genome/year and a divergence date for M66-2 and N16961 in 1923. Applying the same rate of change to their common MN lineage gives an estimated divergence date of 1880 for the 6<sup>th</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> pandemic strains (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Methods</xref> for details). Note that as for pseudogenes, the sequences for the regions involved were verified as discussed in Supporting Methods <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004053.s001">Text S1</xref>. These dates are clearly estimates. There will be statistical sampling errors, and these will be significant as the number of synonymous SNPs between N16961 and M66-2 is low, and this was used to calibrate the mutation rate used to estimate both divergence dates, Also there is no reason to expect a constant rate of divergence over such short periods, as many factors will vary between the different lineages and there is not time for these to average out. For example the average generation time will depend markedly on the fraction of time spent in the host and environment, which will vary over time, Also the effective population size will vary and affect retention of the mutations involved. Indeed O395 and N16961 have clearly had different mutation rates as O395, isolated in 1965, has 30&#x00025; more mutations than N16961 isolated in 1971. However, even as approximations, these estimates fit well with the fact that the El Tor outbreaks first appeared in 1937 and the 6<sup>th</sup> pandemic started in 1899. They are much more realistic than the 10,000&#x02013;50,000 years ago as estimated using conventional rates.</p><p>We conclude that for the <italic>V. cholerae</italic> pandemic strains the traditional criteria give divergence times about 100 fold too long. The rate estimates of Ho et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004053-Ho1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004053-Ho2">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref> were based on related species or forms of a species with good fossil data for divergence times, but our conclusion on much more limited data seems realistic given that 1 million years gave a 10 fold increase over the long term rate for accumulation of divergence, and we are dealing with much shorter periods. It seems clear that as for the cases analysed by Ho et al., we must use data appropriate to the timeframe involved rather than assume a constant rate for accumulation of SNPs. It is also probable that for clones within species, there will be variation in rates of divergence between species and even within species for clones in different niches. If we are to have realistic estimates of divergence times we will need to accumulate data for a range of species from different environments. We also caution that this first application of the approach is based on a very small sample and certainly not so precise as to preclude the possibility that pandemics 1 to 6 were due to the same clone as has also been suggested <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004053-Blake1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>A major reason for studying the evolution of <italic>V. cholerae</italic> is to better understand its pathogenicity and pandemicity. We undertook several analyses focusing on this issue, and while the results were informative, there were no clear &#x0201c;suspects&#x0201d; for the change from causing local outbreaks as exhibited by the Makassar outbreak clone represented by M66-2, and pandemic capacity as exhibited by the 7<sup>th</sup> pandemic clone, represented by N16961 (for details see Supporting Discussion <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004053.s001">Text S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004053.s006">Figure S5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004053.s007">Figure S6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004053.s015">Table S7</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Concluding comments</title><p>The 3 genomes we compare represent critical stages in the history of cholera.

The Makassar outbreak is seen as being at a critical stage in the development of the 7<sup>th</sup> pandemic strain. The three strains are closely related such that recombination events were generally well separated in the genome, enabling us to distinguish between mutation and recombination events. The genomes have been very dynamic with substantial changes through mutation, recombination, acquisition of genes in islands, and acquisition of cassettes in the major integron. We now have the catalogue of genetic differences between the 3 strains that must be responsible for differences in pathogenicity and pandemicity, opening up new areas for research.</p><p>We have been able to put a realistic timeframe to the divergence of the pandemic strains because 1) we could distinguish between mutation and recombination events and used only the mutational SNPs to calculate divergence rate, and 2) N16961 (7<sup>th</sup> pandemic) is thought to be derived from a Makassar outbreak of known date and represented by M66-2, which allowed us to infer a divergence rate, that could then be used to infer a date for divergence of the 6<sup>th</sup> and 7<sup>th</sup> pandemic strains. <italic>V. cholerae</italic> is unusual in having a defined date and location for the origin of a major pandemic that allowed this approach<bold>.</bold> There are other landmarks in the spread of <italic>V. cholerae</italic> which will allow extension of the approach to further refine our understating of the evolution of pandemic cholera, and suitable circumstances are found in some other species.
