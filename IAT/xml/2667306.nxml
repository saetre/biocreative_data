Proteolytic processing of one of the precursors, AtPSK4, was demonstrated by cleavage of a preproAtPSK4&#x02013;myc transgene product to AtPSK4&#x02013;myc. Cleavage of proAtPSK4 was induced by placing root explants in tissue culture. The processing of proAtPSK4 was dependent on AtSBT1.1, a subtilisin-like serine protease, encoded by one of 56 subtilase genes in Arabidopsis. The gene encoding AtSBT1.1 was up-regulated following the transfer of root explants to tissue culture, suggesting that activation of the proteolytic machinery that cleaves proAtPSK4 is dependent on AtSBT1.1 expression. We also demonstrated that a fluorogenic peptide representing the putative subtilase recognition site in proAtPSK4 is cleaved <italic>in vitro</italic> by affinity-purified AtSBT1.1. An alanine scan through the recognition site peptide indicated that AtSBT1.1 is fairly specific for the AtPSK4 precursor. Thus, this peptide growth factor, which promotes callus formation in culture, is proteolytically cleaved from its precursor by a specific plant subtilase encoded by a gene that is up-regulated during the process of transfering root explants to tissue culture.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Arabidopsis</kwd><kwd>phytosulfokine</kwd><kwd>subtilase</kwd><kwd>peptide hormone</kwd><kwd>tissue culture</kwd><kwd>fluorogenic peptide</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Phytosulfokines (PSKs) are a class of plant peptides discovered through the study of growth factors that mediate density-dependent growth in cell culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Matsubayashi and Sakagami, 2006</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Matsubayashi and Sakagami (1996)</xref> isolated and identified growth factors from conditioned medium that promoted the growth at low density of asparagus mesophyll cells in tissue culture.

However, they observed little difference in overall plant growth between wild-type, <italic>pskr1-1</italic> and AtPSKR1ox, an over-expression line. The most prominent characteristic of <italic>pskr1-1</italic> was that vegetative tissues in mature plants lost their ability to form callus.

Di-basic residues are characteristic of substrate sites for subtilases, subtilisin-like serine proteases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Barr, 1991</xref>); therefore, we wished to determine whether any of the proteases encoded by the 56 subtilase genes in the Arabidopsis genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Rautengarten <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>) are responsible for cleavage of the AtPSK4 precursor. In doing so, we identified a subtilase, AtSBT1.1, that is required for cleavage of the fusion protein AtPSK4&#x02013;myc. Cleavage of AtPSK4&#x02013;myc is induced in root explants, suggesting that release of the peptide hormone from the precursor protein is controlled, in part, by the proteolytic processing machinery.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title><italic>Proteolytic cleavage of the PSK4 precursor</italic> in vivo</title><p>In studies of shoot regeneration in Arabidopsis tissue culture, we found that expression of a subtilase gene <italic>AtSBT1.1</italic> (At1g01900) correlated with conditions for efficient shoot regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Lall <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). It was not clear what the causal connection might be between efficient shoot regeneration and expression of a gene encoding a serine protease. Most subtilases are predicted to be secreted proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Rautengarten <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>), so we reasoned that AtSBT1.1 could be involved in processing of an extracellular growth factor or receptor related to shoot regeneration. Growth factors that might require the action of AtSBT1.1 include peptide hormones, such as AtPSKs. AtPSKs promote callus formation in tissue culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Matsubayashi and Sakagami, 2006</xref>), and are synthesized as preproproteins with signal peptides that target them to the secretory pathway and with prosequences that are processed during maturation of the peptide hormone.</p><p>To determine whether AtSBT1.1 is involved in the proteolytic processing of AtPSKs, we developed a constitutively expressed, C-terminal 4 x myc-tagged construct of the AtPSK4 precursor, 35S:ppAtPSK4&#x02013;myc, and studied its processing <italic>in vivo</italic>. PreproAtPSK4 will be referred to as ppAtPSK4 and proAtPSK4 as pAtPSK4. AtPSK4 was chosen for study because it is the most abundantly expressed PSK precursor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Matsubayashi and Sakagami, 2006</xref>). The predicted size of pAtPSK4 with the myc tag is 12.8 kDa, but we observed a band at approximately 19 kDa on Western blots, larger than the predicted size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1a</xref>, wt, 0 time). To demonstrate, nonetheless, that this band is pAtPSK4&#x02013;myc, we analyzed the partially purified myc-tagged protein and identified three peptides derived from the fusion protein by MS/MS analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S1</xref>). Thus, the larger apparent size of pAtPSK4&#x02013;myc may be due to anomalous gel migration behavior or post-translational modification of part of the precursor protein.</p><fig id="fig01" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><italic>In vivo</italic> cleavage of pAtPSK4-myc.</p><p>(a) Root segments from wild-type transgenic seedlings expressing the construct 35S:ppAtPSK4-myc were explanted and incubated on callus induction medium (CIM) for 1-4 days and then transferred onto shoot induction medium (SIM).

We suspected that failure to detect processing may have been due to seedling growth or culture conditions. We had chosen to study AtSBT1.1 in the first place due to observations that we had made about shoot regeneration from root explants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Lall <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). Therefore, we subjected root explants from 35S:ppAtPSK4-myc seedlings to tissue culture conditions for regenerating shoots. This involves pre-incubating root segments on an auxin-rich callus induction medium (CIM), and then transferring them after 4 days to a cytokinin-rich shoot induction medium (SIM). Under these conditions, a band appeared at approximately 7 kDa in Western blots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1a</xref>, wt, lanes 1d and 4d CIM or SIM), representing the myc-tagged cleaved peptide, AtPSK4&#x02013;myc. The size of the processed protein was consistent with a cut at or near the cleavage site as determined by the <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments described below. Thus, cleavage of pAtPSK4&#x02013;myc appears to be induced by some aspect of the culturing process.</p><p>Having identified conditions for pAtPSK4&#x02013;myc cleavage, we wished to determine whether AtSBT1.1 was responsible for the proteolysis. To do so, we examined cleavage of pAtPSK4&#x02013;myc in T-DNA mutants with insertions in AtSBT1.1. The gene encoding AtSBT1.1 (At1g01900) has a single intron, and <italic>sbt1.1-1</italic> (SALK_111561) and <italic>sbt1.1-2</italic> (SALK_108704) have T-DNA insertions in the first exon. The T-DNA lines were judged to be null mutants because AtSBT1.1 transcripts were not found in seedlings from either line (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S2</xref>). The 35S:ppAtPSK4-myc construct was introduced into the two T-DNA mutant lines, and root explants were subjected to regeneration conditions (4 days incubation on CIM). The pAtPSK4&#x02013;myc precursor was produced in these lines, but the cleavage product AtPSK4&#x02013;myc peptide was not detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1a</xref>, lanes <italic>sbt1.1-1</italic> and <italic>sbt1.1-2</italic>). To demonstrate that the transgenic product in these lines was still cleavable, we out-crossed <italic>sbt1.1-1</italic> bearing the 35S:ppAtPSK4-myc construct to wild-type, and demonstrated that processing was restored in root explants of the F<sub>1</sub> seedlings (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Figure S3</xref>). We concluded from these results that AtSBT1.1 is required for pAtPSK4&#x02013;myc cleavage under these conditions. This finding is quite significant given that there are 56 different subtilases encoded by the Arabidopsis genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">Rautengarten <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>).</p><p>As shoot regeneration in culture is dependent on cytokinin and auxin hormones, we determined whether induction of pAtPSK4&#x02013;myc cleavage required hormone treatment during CIM pre-incubation. To test this, root segments were explanted to hormone-free B5 medium as well as to CIM, and it was found that pAtPSK4&#x02013;myc was cleaved on basal B5 medium at 1 and 4 days after explantation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1b</xref>). We concluded that the processing activity was probably induced by the wounding or handling of root tissue during explanting. We then determined how rapidly processing was induced. Cleavage of pAtPSK4&#x02013;myc was first detected approximately 8 h after explanting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">Figure 1c</xref>). Thus induction is fairly rapid, but not immediate as one might expect for a post-translational activation mechanism.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>Up-regulation of</italic> AtSBT1.1 <italic>gene expression</italic></title><p>As pAtPSK4 cleavage was induced approximately 8 h following the explanting of root segments, we wished to determine whether expression of the gene encoding AtSBT1.1 was similarly up-regulated. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR was performed on extracts from root segments at various times following explanting. It was found that AtSBT1.1 was up-regulated approximately 3.5-fold starting at approximately 8 h after explanting root segments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Figure 2a</xref>). Thus, the up-regulation of AtSBT1.1 expression was similar to the kinetics for the acquisition of cleavage activity. The endogenous gene encoding AtPSK4 was also up-regulated after explanting, but not as much as AtSBT1.1 (approximately twofold, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Figure 2a</xref>).</p><fig id="fig02" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Expression profile of AtSBT1.1 and PSK4.</p><p>(a) Quantitative RT-PCR was used to determine the abundance of AtSBT1.1 and PSK4 mRNA relative to actin probes.

Later, AtSBT1.1 and AtPSK4 continued to be expressed most intensely at sites of callus and regenerative tissue formation, both at the ends and at other wound sites along the length of the root segments (6 days SIM, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig02">Figure 2c,e</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Subcellular localization of AtSBT1.1 and AtPSK4</title><p>If pAtPSK4 is indeed a substrate for AtSBT1.1, then these proteins should occupy the same subcellular compartment.

To determine whether that is so, we constructed C-terminal YFP fusions and determined their location in root cells from Arabidopsis. Both AtPSK4&#x02013;YFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Figure 3a&#x02013;c</xref>) and AtSBT1.1&#x02013;YFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig03">Figure 3d&#x02013;f</xref>) are associated with the periphery of the cell, coinciding with propidium iodide staining.

To do so, we developed a pull-down assay using a C-terminal myc-tagged version of AtSBT1.1 (AtSBT1.1&#x02013;myc) and a fluorogenic peptide substrate. We employed a similar assay in a previous study to test the activity of another Arabidopsis subtilase, AtS1P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">Liu <italic>et al.</italic>, 2007a</xref>). In both cases, the tagged subtilases were synthesized in transgenic Arabidopsis because we were not able to produce active enzyme at high levels in heterologous systems.</p><p>To test AtSBT1.1&#x02013;myc for activity against pAtPSK4, we generated a fluorogenic peptide called fpAtPSK4 with the sequence Abz-RRSLVLHTDY(NO2)D-OH [where Abz is a 2-aminobenzoyl fluorescent group and Y(NO2)D-OH is a 3-nitrotyrosine quencher], representing a probable subtilase recognition site in pAtPSK4. The site was chosen because di-basic amino acid residues (in this case, RR) are characteristic signatures of subtilase recognition sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Barr, 1991</xref>). When bead-bound protein from transgenic plants expressing AtSBT1.1&#x02013;myc was incubated with fluorescence-quenched fpAtPSK4, a time-dependent increase in fluorescence was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Figure 4a</xref>). Because the enzyme was produced in a homologous system, we were mindful of potential contamination by endogenous Arabidopsis subtilases in our preparations. To preclude that possibility, we thoroughly washed the beads and routinely ran controls in which the same pull-down procedure was conducted with extracts from non-transgenic seedlings and from transgenic seedlings expressing a tagged subtilase (S552A) that was mutated at the active site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig04">Figure 4a</xref>).</p><fig id="fig04" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Cleavage reaction of the fluorogenic peptide representing the putative subtilase recognition site in pAtPSK4.</p><p>(a) Time-dependent increase in fluorescence during incubation of the fluorogenic peptide fpAtPSK4 with bead-bound AtSBT1.1&#x02013;myc.

The upstream di-basic amino acids and the leucine (P3 position) and histidine and aspartate (P1&#x02032; and P3&#x02032;, respectively) are also conserved in Arabidopsis. To compare the activity of AtSBT1.1 with other AtPSK precursors, we developed fluorogenic peptides representing putative recognition sites for the family of AtPSKs (fpAtPSK1, 2, 3, 5 and 6, see bold residues in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). The putative recognition sites for pAtPSK2 and 5 are the same and are represented in the fluorogenic peptides fpPSK2 and 5. The cleavage reaction was slower for fpAtPSK2 and 5 than for fpAtPSK4, and was barely detectable or not detectable at all with the other fpAtPSKs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig05">Figure 5b</xref>).

Among the 56 subtilases encoded in the Arabidopsis genome, AtSBT1.1 appears to be solely responsible for the release of PSK4 from its precursor in roots, because pAtPSK4&#x02013;myc is not cleaved in AtSBT1.1 knock-out lines. PSKs are growth factors that stimulate callus formation in culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Matsubayashi and Sakagami, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">2006</xref>). Thus, up-regulation of AtSBT1.1 and the release of AtPSK4 from its precursor protein may be key factors in promoting the growth of cells and callus formation in tissue culture.</p><p>AtSBT1.1 functions similarly to prohormone convertases that release peptide hormones and neuropeptides from protein precursors in animal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">Steiner, 1998</xref>). Prohormone convertases are subtilases in the secretory pathway that cleave substrates with mono- or di-basic amino acids in the general recognition motif R/K-Xn-R/K&#x02193; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">Seidah, 1997</xref>). In Arabidopsis, AtSBT1.1 cleaves substrates in a fairly site-specific manner, cleaving pAtPSK4 at RRSLVL&#x02193;HTDY and showing preference for cleavage of proAtPSK4 over other PSK precursors. Cleavage by AtSBT1.1 at the preferred cleavage site of the PSK4 precursor leaves three residues on the N-terminus of the five-residue peptide. This is of concern because <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">Matsubayashi <italic>et al.</italic> (1996)</xref> demonstrated that even the presence of the tripeptide GGG severely reduces the activity of PSKs in an asparagus suspension cell system However, the three residues (HTD) remaining on the amino-end of AtSBT1.1-processed AtPSK4 are highly conserved among the PSKs, and it is possible that the sequence is part of the active, mature peptide or serves as a recognition signal for further processing by enzymes such as tripeptyl peptidases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">Book <italic>et al.</italic>, 2005</xref>). Complete proteolytic processing of PSK4 probably involves a number of other steps, including trimming of the peptide at its C-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">Matsubayashi and Sakagami, 2006</xref>).</p><p>The preferred AtSBT1.1 cleavage site within the recognition motif for proAtPSK4 is somewhat unconventional, because the di-basic residues are usually in the P1 and P2 positions, immediately upstream (on the N-terminal side) of the cleavage site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Barr, 1991</xref>), The only caveat we have about the site is that it was identified from the cleavage product of a short fluorogenic peptide representing the putative subtilase recognition site. Other structural features of the intact AtPSK precursor may be important in determining the site of cleavage, but are not found in the peptide substrates that we used to characterize the cleavage reaction.</p><p>We have shown that YFP fusions of AtSBT1.1 and PSK4 accumulate in the extracellular matrix, and it is probable that cleavage occurs there simply because AtSBT1.1 has a slightly acid pH optimum and the apoplast is acidic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">Bibikova <italic>et al.</italic>, 1998</xref>). PSK4 is tyrosine-sulfated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">Matsubayashi and Sakagami, 1996</xref>), and the protein is likely to be sulfated in the <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi as are other sulfated proteins in animal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">Baeuerle and Huttner, 1987</xref>). Therefore, it seems reasonable that the precursor is sulfated before it is cleaved. However, the precursor does not have to be sulfated to be cleaved, because AtSBT1.1&#x02013;myc can cleave the unsulfated peptide, fpAtPSK4. Sulfation, however, is important for the function of the peptide, because the sulfated peptide binds to the PSK receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">Matsubayashi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2002</xref>).</p><p>Although there are six genes encoding PSKs in Arabidopsis, the mature peptides (YIYTQ) encoded by each gene are identical (with the exception of AtPSK6, YIYTH). Presumably, the peptides encoded by each gene should be able to bind and activate the single known receptor, AtPSKR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">Matsubayashi <italic>et al.</italic>, 2006</xref>). Each of the AtPSK precursors has the typical subtilase recognition site signature (di-basic amino acids) 8-10 residues upstream from the mature peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">Barr, 1991</xref>). However, the residues that are critical for AtSBT1.1 recognition (the four or five residues just downstream from the di-basic site) differ somewhat between AtPSK genes, and therefore AtSBT1.1 appears to be most specific for cleavage of PSK4. That suggests that other subtilases might be involved in the processing of other PSKs.</p><p>Our interest in AtSBT1.1 stems from our earlier studies of shoot regeneration in Arabidopsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Lall <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). We found that higher expression levels of the gene encoding AtSBT1.1 (At1g01900) correlated with the presence of the superior allele at the major QTL conditioning shoot regeneration in Arabidopsis tissue culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">Lall <italic>et al.</italic>, 2004</xref>). Higher levels of AtSBT1.1 expression may not have anything to do directly with shoot regeneration. However, higher levels of AtSBT1.1 expression might promote the proliferation of callus from which shoots are derived. Similar reasoning was used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">Hanai <italic>et al.</italic> (2000)</xref> to explain the stimulatory effects of PSKs on somatic embryo formation in carrot. They concluded that PSKs might promote the proliferation of cells giving rise to somatic embryos, rather than influencing the formation of somatic embryos.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Experimental procedures</title><sec><title>Plant material and growth conditions</title><p>Two T-DNA insertion mutant lines for AtSBT1.1 were obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (ABRC, Columbus, OH).
