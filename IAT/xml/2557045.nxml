The GTPase activities of the receptors are implicated in two key import activities, preprotein binding and driving membrane translocation, but their precise functions have not been defined. We use a combination of in vivo and in vitro approaches to study the role of the Toc159 receptor in the import reaction. We show that atToc159-A864R, a receptor with reduced GTPase activity, can fully complement a lethal insertion mutation in the ATTOC159 gene. Surprisingly, the atToc159-A864R receptor increases the rate of protein import relative to wild-type receptor in isolated chloroplasts by stabilizing the formation of a GTP-dependent preprotein binding intermediate. These data favor a model in which the atToc159 receptor acts as part of a GTP-regulated switch for preprotein recognition at the TOC translocon.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used in this paper: A-domain, acidic domain; G-domain, GTPase domain; M-domain, membrane domain; PIC, protease inhibitor cocktail; preSSu, precursor to the small subunit of rubisco; SSu, mature small subunit of rubisco; TIC, translocon at the inner chloroplast membrane; TOC, translocon at the outer chloroplast membrane.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Plastids (e.g., chloroplasts) are a diverse group of interrelated organelles that have evolved to perform numerous and diverse metabolic processes within all plant cells, including essential roles in photosynthesis, amino acid and lipid synthesis, and cell signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Neuhaus and Emes, 2000</xref>). The biogenesis of these organelles and their differentiation into specialized forms in different tissues relies on the import of thousands of nuclear-encoded proteins from the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jarvis, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Richly and Leister, 2004</xref>). Protein import is mediated by several translocation systems, designated translocons, which reside within the outer and inner envelope membranes of the organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bedard and Jarvis, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gutensohn et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kessler and Schnell, 2006</xref>). The majority of plastid proteins are synthesized with N-terminal cleavable transit peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bruce, 2001</xref>), and their import is mediated by the TOC&#x02013;TIC translocon system. The translocon at the outer envelope membrane of chloroplasts (TOC) recognizes the intrinsic transit peptides of plastid preproteins at the organelle surface and initiates the import process by transferring the preprotein to a protein-conducting channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kessler and Schnell, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rounds et al., 2007</xref>). The Toc complex physically associates with the translocon at the inner envelope membrane of chloroplasts (TIC) to facilitate simultaneous transport of proteins across the double membrane of the envelope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gutensohn et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>The core of the TOC translocon consists of two receptor GTPases, Toc159 and Toc34, which associate with a membrane channel that contains the &#x003b2;-barrel protein, Toc75 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rounds et al., 2007</xref>). The gene families encoding these proteins are essential in arabidopsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jarvis et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bauer et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baldwin et al., 2005</xref>), underscoring their central roles in the import process. Toc34 consists of a cytosolically exposed GTPase domain (G-domain) that is anchored to the outer membrane by a simple, C-terminal &#x003b1;-helical transmembrane segment. Toc159 contains a homologous, cytosolic G-domain, but its C-terminal membrane anchor domain (M-domain) is larger (&#x0223c;50 kD) and more complex. Furthermore, it contains an N-terminal acidic domain that is highly variable among members of the Toc159 gene family and is proposed to contribute to transit peptide specificity of the translocon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ivanova et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kubis et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Multiple lines of evidence indicate that Toc34 and Toc159 play key roles in regulating protein targeting and plastid biogenesis. First, the two receptors mediate preprotein recognition at the chloroplast surface by binding directly to transit peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Perry and Keegstra, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ma et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kouranov and Schnell, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sveshnikova et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schleiff et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Smith et al., 2004</xref>). The import of bound preproteins is inhibited by nonhydrolyzable GTP analogues, indicating that GTP hydrolysis at the TOC regulates transfer of the preprotein into the protein-conducting channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Olsen and Keegstra, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ma et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Young et al., 1999</xref>). The GTPase domains of the two receptors are involved in transit peptide binding, and binding stimulates the GTPase activities of the receptors, providing a link between preprotein recognition and GTPase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jelic et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Smith et al., 2004</xref>). As such, Toc34 and Toc159 are hypothesized to act as a coordinated GTPase switch that controls protein import into the organelle.</p><p>Second, members of the Toc159 and Toc34 gene families in arabidopsis have been shown to form structurally and functionally distinct translocon complexes that constitute distinct pathways for protein import into plastids. Genetic and biochemical analyses indicate that different members of the arabidopsis Toc159 (atToc159) and Toc34 (atToc33) families function in the import of different classes of preproteins that are required for specialized (e.g., photosynthesis) and housekeeping functions of the organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jarvis et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bauer et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kubis et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ivanova et al., 2004</xref>). Mutations in genes encoding specific atToc159 and atToc33 family members interfere with plastid differentiation at different stages. These studies demonstrate an important role for the TOC GTPase receptors in coordinating protein trafficking with the changes in gene expression that accompany plant development.</p><p>Despite the central role for the TOC GTPases in regulating protein import, the molecular mechanism by which their GTPase activities control preprotein recognition and translocation remain undefined. Two major models have been proposed as working hypotheses for TOC receptor function. In one model, Toc159 and Toc34 form a GTP regulated gate that controls access of preproteins to the TOC channel, thereby maintaining the fidelity of import and regulating the specificity of translocons for distinct classes of preproteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Seedorf et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kessler and Schnell, 2004</xref>). Although this model includes roles for both GTPases in preprotein binding at the translocon, Toc159 is proposed to function primarily in defining the selectivity of the translocon, whereas Toc34 is envisioned to function in conjunction with Toc159 to initiate transfer of the preprotein to the Toc channel. This proposal is supported by covalent cross-linking studies that demonstrate that Toc159 forms the primary contact with transit peptides during preprotein binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Perry and Keegstra, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ma et al., 1996</xref>). Furthermore, the atToc159 family members appear to largely dictate the specificity of different TOC complexes for distinct classes of preproteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hiltbrunner et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ivanova et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kubis et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Smith et al., 2004</xref>), consistent with a role for this receptor family in regulating initial preprotein recognition. In contrast, the two Toc34 receptors in arabidopsis appear to be largely functionally redundant in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jarvis et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>A second model proposes that Toc159 GTPase activity provides the energetic driving force for preprotein translocation through the Toc channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schleiff et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Becker et al., 2004</xref>). In this scenario, Toc34 is proposed to function primarily in preprotein recognition and Toc159 is envisioned to function downstream as a repetitive GTP-driven motor that forces the preprotein through the Toc channel. This model is based on the observation that reconstituted proteoliposomes containing Toc75 and a fragment of Toc159, corresponding to its G- and M-domains, can support a minimum level of GTP-dependent preprotein translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schleiff et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>The proposals for TOC GTPase function are largely in agreement on the critical role of the functional interactions between the two GTPases and their involvement in GTP-regulated preprotein recognition at the Toc complex. However, the models present very distinct hypotheses for the molecular mechanism of TOC GTPase function during import. The major differences between these models center on the role of Toc159 and its GTPase activity in preprotein recognition and translocation. Toc159 is alternatively proposed to function early in import as the primary preprotein receptor or late in import as the driving force for membrane translocation. One major issue in defining the specific role for Toc159 in TOC complex function is the lack of in vivo analysis of its GTPase function. The models based on in vitro biochemical analysis of Toc159 also are qualified by the fact that they rely on the use of purified or overexpressed fragments of the receptor that lack one or more of the domains found in the full-length native protein.</p><p>In this study, we aimed to more clearly define the role of Toc159 GTPase activity in TOC translocon function using in vivo genetic approaches combined with in vitro import assays using intact chloroplasts with full-length receptor. To this end, we took advantage of an arabidopsis mutant, <italic>ppi2</italic>, which lacks expression of atToc159, the major Toc159 family member expressed in chloroplasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bauer et al., 2000</xref>). We expressed atToc159-A864R, a mutated form of atToc159 that has significantly reduced GTPase activity, in <italic>ppi2</italic> and examined the effects of the mutation on protein import and chloroplast biogenesis. Remarkably, the atToc159-A864R receptor was able to fully complement the <italic>ppi2</italic> lethal phenotype. Furthermore, chloroplasts containing the atToc159-A864R mutant exhibited an increased rate of protein import relative to wild-type chloroplasts. Biochemical analysis indicated that the atToc159-A864R receptor increases the efficiency of preprotein targeting to chloroplasts. Our studies demonstrate that the nucleotide state of Toc159 regulates the formation of a stable preprotein binding intermediate, and thereby plays a regulatory role in preprotein recognition at the TOC translocon.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Expression of an atToc159 GTPase mutant can complement the <italic>ppi2</italic> lethal phenotype</title><p>Our strategy for assessing the role of atToc159 GTPase activity centered on expressing the atToc159-A864R mutant in stable transformants of the atToc159 null mutant, <italic>ppi2,</italic> and investigating the effects on chloroplast biogenesis and protein import. AtToc159-A864R contains a single point mutation that converts a conserved alanine to an arginine in the G1 motif (P-loop) of atToc159. Previous studies showed that the <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>&#x02013;expressed G-domain of atToc159-A864R binds GTP and GDP with equal or slightly higher affinities compared with wild-type receptor, but its GTPase activity is reduced to &#x0223c;10% of that of atToc159 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Smith et al., 2002</xref>). To confirm that the activities of the full-length receptors are comparable to those measured with isolated G-domains, we purified full-length wild-type atToc159 and atToc159-A864R from a reticulocyte lysate in vitro translation system using immunoprecipitation and measured their activities using a standard GTPase assay. Fig. S1 A (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200803034/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200803034/DC1</ext-link>) shows that the hydrolytic activity of atToc159-A864R (K<sub>M</sub> &#x0003d; 1.9 &#x000b1; 0.30 &#x003bc;M; k<sub>cat</sub> &#x0003d; 0.0042 &#x000b1; 0.0001 min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) is &#x0223c;30% of that measured for wild-type atToc159 (K<sub>M</sub> &#x0003d; 3.2 &#x000b1; 0.34 &#x003bc;M; k<sub>cat</sub> &#x0003d; 0.014 &#x000b1; 0.0022 min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>). The hydrolytic activity of wild-type atToc159 is similar to that measured for purified, soluble atToc159 G-domain (K<sub>M</sub> &#x0003d; 9.0 &#x000b1; 1.35 &#x003bc;M; k<sub>cat</sub> &#x0003d; 0.019 &#x000b1; 0.0015 min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>), indicating that the activities of the full-length and isolated G-domains are comparable. Furthermore, these data demonstrate that immunoprecipitation does not significantly affect the enzymatic activity of the receptor. As negative controls, we included two additional receptor G-domain constructs in the assay, atToc159-G1m and atToc33G-G1m. These receptors carry triple mutations within the G1 motif of their GTP-binding sites and previously were shown to lack GTP binding and hydrolytic activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bauer et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Smith et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wallas et al., 2003</xref>). No measurable hydrolytic activity was detected in either case (Fig. S1 B). Together, the data are consistent with the results using the purified G-domains and indicate that the atToc159-A864R mutant has a significantly lower hydrolytic rate than wild-type receptor.</p><p>A transformation vector encoding atToc159-A864R under control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter (CaMV35S) was transformed into heterozygous <italic>ppi2</italic> plants. Independent transformants were segregated to select for plants homozygous for both <italic>ppi2</italic> and CaMV35S&#x02237;atTOC159-A864R (A864R:<italic>ppi2</italic>). The genotypes of the transformed plants were confirmed by PCR amplification of the wild-type authentic atTOC159 gene, the <italic>ppi2</italic> T-DNA marker, and the CaMV35S:atTOC159-A864R transgene (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>). To confirm that the transgene was expressed in the <italic>ppi2</italic> background, we performed immunoblots of plant extracts with anti-atToc159 serum. A <italic>ppi2</italic> line expressing CaMV35S&#x02237;atTOC159 (WT:<italic>ppi2</italic>) that was previously generated was used as a control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bauer et al., 2002</xref>). Full-length atToc159 was present in wild-type and WT:<italic>ppi2,</italic> whereas a full-length protein corresponding to atToc159-A864R was detected in A864R:<italic>ppi2</italic> plants (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). Immunoblots of serial dilutions of extracts from these plants indicates that receptor expression in WT:<italic>ppi2</italic> and A864R:<italic>ppi2</italic> plants is similar, and both transgenes are expressed at levels only moderately higher than authentic atToc159 in wild-type (WT) plants. Alkaline extraction of membrane fractions from wild-type and A864R:<italic>ppi2</italic> plants indicated that atToc159-A864R was membrane integrated, consistent with correct targeting to the outer envelope membrane (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>). Moreover, atToc75 and atToc33 coimmunoprecipitated with atToc159 and atToc159-A864R from detergent-soluble extracts, demonstrating that the mutation did not detectably affect receptor targeting or TOC complex assembly (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Arabidopsis <italic>ppi2</italic> homozygous plants expressing atToc159 and atToc159-A864R.</bold> Heterozygous <italic>ppi2</italic> plants were transformed with CaMV35S&#x02237;atToc159 and CaMV35S&#x02237;atToc159-A864R binary vectors encoding atToc159 and atToc159-A864R, respectively.

The atToc159 receptor has previously been shown to be required for the development of chloroplasts from undifferentiated plastids in the majority of green tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bauer et al., 2000</xref>). Therefore, we tested whether the atToc159-A864R mutation might delay this developmental process by partially disrupting the protein import process. In this experiment, the seeds were stratified in the dark at 4&#x000b0;C and exposed to a short pulse of light to initiate germination. The germinating seeds were equilibrated in the dark at 20&#x000b0;C, resulting in etiolated (nongreen) seedlings that lack fully developed chloroplasts. The seedlings were then transferred to light to trigger photomorphogenesis and chloroplast development. We monitored chlorophyll accumulation at 20 and 28 h after transferring the plants to light. As shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D</xref>, WT:<italic>ppi2</italic> and A864R:<italic>ppi2</italic> plants accumulated chlorophyll at similar rates.

All subsequent experiments were performed with chloroplasts isolated using this procedure.</p><p>Isolated chloroplasts were incubated with [<sup>35</sup>S]-labeled chloroplast preprotein, preSSu, in the presence of 1 mM GTP and 2 mM ATP to promote import for 5 or 20 min at 25&#x000b0;C (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>). Import into chloroplasts from wild-type and WT:<italic>ppi2</italic> plants were indistinguishable, demonstrating that expression of wild-type atToc159 under a non-native promoter does not measurably affect the import process. Surprisingly, the levels of preSSu import were significantly higher in atToc159-A864R chloroplasts compared with the two controls at each time point. The accumulation of SSu in atToc159-A864R chloroplasts was approximately double both wild-type or <italic>ppi2</italic> chloroplasts expressing wild-type atToc159 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref>). Thermolysin treatment of the atToc159-A864R chloroplasts following the import reaction removed bound preSSu but did not digest the processed form (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>), demonstrating that the mature SSu represented completely imported protein and not a partially imported substrate. Interestingly, import into atToc159-A864R chloroplasts remained sensitive to the GTP analogue, GTP&#x003b3;S (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>). Import into both wild-type and atToc159-A864R chloroplasts was reduced by &#x0223c;60% in the presence of the analogue. Therefore, GTP hydrolysis within the TOC translocon is still required for the import reaction, even when atToc159 hydrolytic activity is reduced by 70%. The inhibition by the analogue could be due to an effect on the residual activity of atToc159-A864R or on atToc33.</p><fig position="float" id="fig3"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>The levels of protein import into atToc159-A864R chloroplasts are increased compared with wild-type chloroplasts.</bold> (A) Isolated chloroplasts from WT, WT:<italic>ppi2</italic>, and A864R:<italic>ppi2</italic> plants were incubated with in vitro&#x02013;translated [<sup>35</sup>S]preSSu under import conditions for the times indicated.

The results in <xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 A</xref> and subsequent studies (unpublished data) indicated that preSSu import was linear with time between 0 and 7 min and leveled off beyond that time period.

To analyze whether the higher rate of import into atToc159-A864R chloroplasts represented an increase in the affinity of TOC translocons for preSSu (i.e., increased import rate constants) or an overall increase in the maximum import rate (i.e., turnover number), we performed a kinetic analysis of import using purified <italic>E. coli</italic>&#x02013;expressed [<sup>35</sup>S]-preSSu (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 B</xref>). The maximum import rates calculated from the kinetic data for atToc159-A8684R (49 &#x000b1; 1.0 pmol preSSu/min/&#x003bc;mol chlorophyll) and atToc159 (41 &#x000b1; 0.75 pmol preSSu/min/&#x003bc;mol chlorophyll) chloroplasts were similar. Therefore, the increased rate of preSSu does not appear to result from an overall increase in turnover number.

Approximately 50% of the bound preprotein can be imported and processed to its mature form, indicating that the bound precursor represents an intermediate on the import pathway. These data indicate that the GTP-bound form of atToc159 functions as the active component in stable preprotein binding to the TOC translocon. The increased binding in the presence of GTP likely results from the stabilization of the initial binding of preprotein to the TOC translocon that previously was observed only when stabilized by chemical cross-linkers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Perry and Keegstra, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ma et al., 1996</xref>).

The reduction of binding by GTP&#x003b3;S in both the wild-type and atToc159-A864R chloroplasts suggests that stable preprotein binding is blocked when both atToc159 and atToc33 are locked in their GTP-bound forms. Furthermore, it is consistent with the hypothesis that both receptor GTPases participate in the initial binding of preproteins to the translocon.</p><p>As a final step in our analysis, we examined the components involved in the GTP-dependent binding observed with atToc159-A864R chloroplasts. To this end, we used the homobifunctional cysteine cross-linker, DTME (dithio-bismaleimidoethane), to cross-link bound preSSu to isolated chloroplasts in the presence of GTP. As previously observed, preSSu binding to atToc159-A864R chloroplasts was significantly higher than the wild-type controls (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 A</xref>, top). Consistent with this observation, approximately three times the levels of preSSu coimmunoprecipitated with atToc159-A864R compared with wild-type atToc159 from detergent solubilized chloroplasts (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7, A and B</xref>). The levels of preSSu that coimmunoprecipitated with atToc33 were increased by &#x0223c;50% in atToc159-A864R chloroplasts.

Identification of the intermediate was made possible by increasing the GTP-bound form of the atToc159 receptor using the atToc159-A864R mutant that binds but does not efficiently hydrolyze GTP. In the presence of GTP, atToc159-A864R promotes stable binding of preprotein to the TOC translocon (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). This results in an apparent increase in the affinity of the translocon for preSSu (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4</xref>). The bound preprotein is efficiently chased into chloroplasts under import conditions, indicating that it represents a productive step in the import process. The GTP-dependent binding observed in atToc159-A864R chloroplasts results in an increased rate of protein import (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Figs. 3</xref> and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>) and accounts for the ability of the mutant receptor to complement the atToc159 null mutant, <italic>ppi2</italic> (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Figs. 1</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). On the basis of these results, we conclude that GTP-dependent binding represents an early step in docking of the preprotein to the TOC translocon.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that GTP alone supports low levels of preprotein binding. However, the nature of this binding has been difficult to define because the levels were similar to, or only slightly higher than, binding observed in the absence of added NTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Olsen and Keegstra, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Young et al., 1999</xref>) and were captured only by covalent cross-linking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Perry and Keegstra, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ma et al., 1996</xref>). The atToc159-A864R receptor increases GTP-dependent preprotein binding, apparently by stabilizing the GTP-bound form of the receptor. In contrast to the early import intermediate, the bound preprotein appears not to have initiated membrane translocation because import from the bound state requires GTP hydrolysis (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>), whereas complete translocation of the early import intermediate does not (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Young et al., 1999</xref>). Furthermore, the early import intermediate requires low concentrations of ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Olsen et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Olsen and Keegstra, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schnell and Blobel, 1993</xref>). Therefore, the GTP-dependent binding intermediate represents a stage in import that precedes preprotein insertion in the TOC channel and likely corresponds to the initial interaction of preproteins with the translocon.</p><p>This work and numerous previous studies clearly have established that GTP hydrolysis regulates the initiation of translocation across the outer membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Olsen and Keegstra, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kessler et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ma et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kouranov and Schnell, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Young et al., 1999</xref>). Although atToc159-A864R promotes preprotein binding to the translocon, it does not appear to affect membrane translocation. Nevertheless, GTP analogues inhibit subsequent insertion of the preproteins into the TOC channel (i.e., formation of the early import intermediate) (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). These observations are consistent with a role for GTP hydrolysis in initiating membrane translocation, but suggest that this occurs downstream of the GTP-dependent binding step and likely involves the atToc33 GTPase. The results favor models in which GTP-binding and hydrolysis at atToc159 are primarily involved in preprotein targeting to the translocon and are not strictly required for initiating membrane translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rounds et al., 2007</xref>). This hypothesis is consistent with several other observations. Pea chloroplasts that have been proteolyzed to selectively remove the amino-terminal A-domain and the G-domain of psToc159, but retain intact psToc34 and psToc75, exhibit reduced preprotein binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2000</xref>). Nonetheless, these chloroplasts remain import competent, albeit with reduced import rates. Importantly, import in these proteolyzed chloroplasts is still sensitive to nonhydrolyzable analogues, demonstrating a direct role for psToc34 GTPase activity in initiating membrane translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2000</xref>). Moreover, an atToc159 deletion construct, consisting solely of the M-domain, can partially complement the arabidopsis <italic>ppi2</italic> mutant when expressed in stable transgenic plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>Although our data support a primary role for Toc159 in targeting preproteins to the translocon, the data also demonstrate that the initial binding of preproteins involves the concerted activities of both atToc159 and atToc33. AtToc33 and atToc159 both covalently cross-link to the preprotein at the GTP-dependent docking stage (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). This is consistent with previous label-transfer cross-linking experiments in which both psToc159 and psToc34 were shown to interact with preproteins during initial binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kouranov et al., 1999</xref>). Together, these results indicate that both GTPases participate in this early binding step. Although decreasing GTP hydrolysis at atToc159 and therefore favoring its GTP-bound state appears to increase the stability of preprotein binding, the fact that GTP&#x003b3;S inhibits binding suggests that locking both atToc159 and atToc33 in their GTP-bound forms inhibits binding. These data suggest that atToc159 and atToc33 are not in the same nucleotide-bound state (i.e., GTP bound) during this initial interaction.</p><p>The accumulated evidence suggests that the Toc159 family of receptors constitute the key determinants of preprotein binding specificity at TOC translocons. Arabidopsis contains four atToc159 family members, and atToc159 and two other family members, atToc132 and atToc120, form separate translocons that have been shown to bind distinct preproteins in vitro and to mediate distinct import pathways in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hiltbrunner et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ivanova et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kubis et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Smith et al., 2004</xref>). In contrast, the two Toc34 proteins in arabidopsis, atToc33 and atToc34, exhibit modest selectivity in preprotein binding studies, and their functions are redundant in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jarvis et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kubis et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Constan et al., 2004</xref>). The different import pathways generated by the Toc159 receptors appear to be critical for plastid biogenesis (e.g., chloroplast formation) at various stages of plant development. The observation that the GTP-bound form of atToc159 promotes preprotein binding suggests that atToc159 GTPase activity regulates the initial docking of preproteins to the translocon and likely plays a key role in selective preprotein targeting. In this scenario, productive preprotein binding to the GTP-bound form of Toc159 would promote the formation of a stable preprotein&#x02013;TOC complex that includes binding to Toc34. Subsequent GTP binding and hydrolysis at Toc34 would result in preprotein dissociation from the receptors and transfer to the TOC channel, thereby initiating the translocation reaction. We propose that GTP hydrolysis at Toc159 resets the translocon to a prebinding state following translocation. The prebinding state would prevent translocation in the absence of productive preprotein binding. This mechanism would allow the different Toc159 family members to selectively target preproteins to specific translocons and preclude the binding and translocation of preproteins from other import pathways. Preprotein binding and import in atToc159-A864R chloroplasts are more efficient because the GTP-bound form of the receptor would stabilize the import-competent state of the translocon, thereby bypassing the prebinding state of the translocon.</p><p>A previous reconstitution study suggested that Toc159 GTPase activity was the major driving force for membrane translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schleiff et al., 2003</xref>). In that work, translocation of a chloroplast preprotein was observed in artificial proteoliposomes that were reconstituted with renatured psToc75 and a fragment of psToc159 containing its G- and M-domains. Our studies demonstrate that inhibition of atToc159 GTPase activity does not inhibit membrane translocation in vivo. These data are inconsistent with a function for Toc159 as a translocation motor. However, Toc159 GTPase activity might contribute to dissociation of the preproteins from the receptor complex and transfer to the Toc channel, thereby facilitating insertion in the channel. In the reconstituted system, the activity might be sufficient to allow some transport across the membrane in the absence of Toc34. In this model, the functions of the Toc159 and Toc34 GTPase activities within native translocons are partially overlapping, with Toc159 GTPase activity primarily involved in preprotein recognition and Toc34 GTPase activity primarily involved in the initiation of translocation. Together, it is clear that cooperative activities of the Toc159 and Toc34 GTPases are required for translocon function in vivo.

For the chase experiments, chloroplasts (200 &#x003bc;g chlorophyll) containing bound preprotein or the early import intermediate reactions were generated as above. Chloroplasts recovered after isolation over the 35% Percoll cushion were washed once and resuspended in import buffer. Preprotein translocation was initiated with the addition of 5 mM ATP and samples were incubated at 26&#x000b0;C for the times indicated. Where indicated, chloroplasts were first incubated for 5 min in the dark with 0.1 mM GTP&#x003b3;S. All samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by phosphorimaging.

The chloroplasts were resuspended in 475 &#x003bc;l HS buffer and 25 &#x003bc;l of DMSO-dissolved DTME (dithio-bismaleimidoethane; Thermo Fisher Scientific) was added to a final concentration of 2.5 mM. Cross-linking reactions were conducted on ice in the dark for 45 min. Glycine (50 mM final concentration in HS buffer) was then added to quench the reactions. Chloroplasts were pelleted and washed once with HS buffer before further manipulation. Immunoprecipitation reactions were performed under denaturing conditions as described above, and the amounts of precipitated receptors and bound preSSu were determined by quantitative immunoblotting and phosphorimager analysis, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Online supplemental material</title><p>Fig. S1 shows Michaelis-Menten (Fig. S1 A) and rate (Fig. S1 B) analysis for GTP hydrolysis by full-length atToc159 and atToc159-A864R compared with the isolated atToc159 G-domain and atToc159 mutants known to lack GTPase activity.
