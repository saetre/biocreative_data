In the early <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo, AJ assembly depends on Bazooka (Baz; PAR-3), but it is unclear how Baz affects AJ assembly and what precursors are involved. To understand this process at the molecular level, we counted the number of core AJ proteins and Baz proteins at an average spot AJ (SAJ) and determined their dynamics with fluorescence recovery after photobleaching experiments. These data reveal that SAJs are subdivided into Baz clusters and cadherin&#x02013;catenin clusters with independent protein numbers and dynamics. This independence suggests that precursory cadherin&#x02013;catenin clusters might form before SAJ assembly. We identify cadherin&#x02013;catenin clusters forming between apical microvilli. Further analyses show that they form independently of Baz and that Baz functions in repositioning them to apicolateral sites for full SAJ assembly. Our data implicate cell protrusions in initial cadherin&#x02013;catenin clustering in the <italic>Drosophila</italic><italic>melanogaster</italic> embryo. Then, independent Baz clusters appear to engage the cadherin&#x02013;catenin clusters to assemble SAJs.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Epithelial tissue structure requires adherens junction (AJ) assembly from E-cadherin (<italic>Drosophila</italic><italic>melanogaster</italic> E-cadherin [DE-cad]) in flies, &#x003b2;-catenin (Armadillo [Arm]), and &#x003b1;-catenin. AJ assembly typically begins with homophilic cis- and trans-cadherin clustering. This breaks the symmetric distribution of cadherin&#x02013;catenin complexes on the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Tepass et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Perez-Moreno et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gumbiner, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hartsock and Nelson, 2008</xref>). In cell culture, cell protrusions break this symmetry by sweeping E-cadherin and &#x003b2;-catenin into puncta at cell&#x02013;cell contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adams et al., 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Vasioukhin et al., 2000</xref>). Recruitment of actin regulators then reorganizes actin to form more stable contacts with expanded belt-like AJs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Drees et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Yamada et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Yamada and Nelson, 2007</xref>).</p><p>In <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos, the first epithelium forms uniquely. Cells are forced into contact by cellularization, the simultaneous compartmentalization of &#x0223c;6,000 nuclei by plasma membranes invaginating from the embryo surface. Two types of junctions form: spot AJs (SAJs) in the apicolateral region and transient basal junctions (BJs) at the base of early invaginating membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Tepass et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Lecuit, 2004</xref>). The polarity regulator Bazooka (Baz; PAR-3) is required for SAJ assembly next to centrosomes in a process involving dynein and microtubules (MTs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Harris and Peifer, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">2005</xref>). Thus, Baz acts as part of an early AJ assembly landmark, but does Baz break a symmetric distribution of DE-cad/Arm, or are earlier clustering events involved? We used protein counting and FRAP experiments to define SAJ structure and live imaging and mutant analyses to dissect SAJ assembly.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><sec><title>Baz and core AJ proteins have different numbers at SAJs</title><p>To count protein numbers at a late-cellularization SAJ, we analyzed stocks containing only GFP-tagged forms of DE-cad, Arm, and Baz. Two steps were taken. First, cortical localization maps were made for an average cell. Because the cells are simple hexagonal columns, we first made montages of x-y planes of single cell sides stacked in z (this imaged all SAJs even with membrane bending; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>, bracket). The montages provided SAJ apical&#x02013;basal position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>, dots), number, width, length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>, bottom), and mean fluorescence intensity profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>; see Materials and methods). The montages also provided whole cell height and perimeter plus mean intensity profiles for the intervening membrane (IM) surrounding SAJs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>). These data were combined into 3D maps of SAJ and IM fluorescence intensities over an average cell cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>). Each protein localized to similar numbers of SAJs in the top 9 &#x000b5;m of the cell.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>1:7:7 stoichiometry of Baz, DE-cad, and Arm at SAJs.</bold> (A&#x02013;D) Mapping protein distributions.

We compared known numbers of late cellularization embryos to GFP standard curves by ELISA assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, E&#x02013;G</xref>). DE-cad&#x02237;GFP and Arm&#x02237;GFP had similar numbers per embryo, but Baz&#x02237;GFP had 17&#x02013;18-fold fewer numbers (P &#x0003c; 0.01; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 I</xref>). The GFP-tagged proteins had similar levels to corresponding endogenous proteins in wild-type (WT) embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 H</xref>). Based on cellularizing embryos having 5,952 &#x000b1; 329 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Fowlkes et al., 2008</xref>), we calculated protein numbers per cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 I</xref>). Applying this to our localization maps revealed similar DE-cad&#x02237;GFP and Arm&#x02237;GFP protein numbers per membrane at an SAJ but about sevenfold fewer Baz&#x02237;GFP proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 I</xref>). In an equal IM area, we calculated &#x0223c;4.5-fold fewer DE-cad&#x02237;GFP proteins, &#x0223c;6.5-fold fewer Arm&#x02237;GFP proteins, and 28-fold fewer Baz&#x02237;GFP proteins than at an SAJ. We assumed zero cytoplasmic protein.</p><p>A limitation of assigning whole embryo protein counts to localization maps was the high final SDs created by combining many parameters (see Materials and methods). To confirm the DE-cad/Arm to Baz ratio, we directly compared fluorescence levels at late cellularization SAJs under the same coverslip and settings. DE-cad&#x02237;GFP and Arm&#x02237;GFP fluorescence overlapped, but Baz&#x02237;GFP fluorescence was about sixfold lower (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 J</xref>). IM DE-cad&#x02237;GFP and Arm&#x02237;GFP were also about sixfold lower. Thus, DE-cad and Arm have a 1:1 ratio in SAJs, as expected, but Baz is at 6&#x02013;7-fold lower levels. More specifically, we calculated densities of 1,236 DE-cad&#x02237;GFP, 1,565 Arm&#x02237;GFP, and 220 Baz&#x02237;GFP proteins/&#x000b5;m<sup>2</sup> per membrane at an SAJ (based on SAJ length and width; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>). These DE-cad/Arm densities are &#x0223c;10-fold lower than fully packed desmosomal cadherins detected at 17,500 proteins/&#x000b5;m<sup>2</sup> per membrane by EM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Al-Amoudi et al., 2007</xref>) and more similar to chicken retinal epithelial AJs, which, by EM, showed 700 cadherins/&#x000b5;m<sup>2</sup> per membrane arranged as subclusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Miyaguchi, 2000</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Baz and core AJ proteins have different dynamics at SAJs</title><p>How does Baz organize DE-cad/Arm into SAJs with a 1:7 ratio? We tested three models with distinct dynamics. (1) Baz recruiting DE-cad/Arm to SAJ assembly sites in a 1:1 ratio but most Baz exiting for the 1:7 SAJ ratio; each would have equal entry rates, but Baz would have an approximately sevenfold lower SAJ immobile fraction. (2) DE-cad/Arm diffusing to SAJ assembly sites where Baz seeds their clustering in a 1:7 ratio; entry rates could be independent, but Baz would have an equal or higher immobile fraction. (3) Independently formed Baz and DE-cad/Arm clusters engaging at 1:7 molecular ratios; entry rates and immobile fractions could both be independent.</p><p>To test the models, we used FRAP to probe late cellularization SAJs. We calculated recovery rates for the first 30 s after bleaching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, A&#x02013;C</xref>), first relative to initial SAJ fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 D</xref>) and then relative to protein numbers in an SAJ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 E</xref>). Baz&#x02237;GFP net entry rates (mean of 2.54 proteins/s) covered a lower range than those of DE-cad&#x02237;GFP and Arm&#x02237;GFP, which overlapped (means of 8.87 and 6.96 proteins/s, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 E</xref>), arguing against the 1:1 entry model. Baz&#x02237;GFP immobile fractions (33 &#x000b1; 24%) were lower than those of DE-cad&#x02237;GFP (48 &#x000b1; 16%, P &#x0003c; 0.05) and Arm&#x02237;GFP (63 &#x000b1; 11%, P &#x0003c; 0.01; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, A&#x02013;C</xref>), arguing against the seeding model. Baz&#x02237;GFP <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> values (14 &#x000b1; 4 s) were also lower than those of DE-cad&#x02237;GFP (37 &#x000b1; 12 s, P &#x0003c; 0.01) and Arm&#x02237;GFP (44 &#x000b1; 14 s, P &#x0003c; 0.01). Arm&#x02237;GFP immobile fractions were higher than DE-cad&#x02237;GFP values, but their <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> values were indistinguishable. Overall, the lower Baz entry rates and immobile fractions argued against SAJ assembly via 1:1 entry or seeding alone, suggesting interactions between independent Baz and DE-cad/Arm clusters.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Distinct Baz and DE-cad/Arm dynamics at SAJs.</bold> (A&#x02013;C) Late cellularization SAJ bleach/recovery plots for DE-cad&#x02237;GFP (26 SAJs), Arm&#x02237;GFP (21 SAJs), and Baz&#x02237;GFP (22 SAJs).

With fixation, DE-cad and Arm are in relatively smooth BJs and apicolateral SAJs at early cellularization with BJ loss by late cellularization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Muller and Wieschaus, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hunter and Wieschaus, 2000</xref>). DE-cad&#x02237;GFP and Arm&#x02237;GFP showed both patterns live (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, A and B</xref>, bottom two rows). Surprisingly, we also saw previously undetected DE-cad&#x02237;GFP and Arm&#x02237;GFP puncta at peripheral and central regions of the apical cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, A and B</xref>, arrows). DE-cad&#x02237;GFP apical surface puncta were lost with fixation (unpublished data), suggesting endogenous puncta are also sensitive to fixation. By late cellularization, apical surface puncta were lost, and DE-cad&#x02237;GFP and Arm&#x02237;GFP localized primarily to apicolateral SAJs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, A and B</xref>, brackets). As with past fixed imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Harris and Peifer, 2004</xref>), Baz&#x02237;GFP was absent from BJs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 C</xref>). At early and mid cellularization, Baz&#x02237;GFP was detected weakly near the apical surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 C</xref>, arrows), but fewer Baz&#x02237;GFP puncta were detected in the central region of the apical surface (0.2 &#x000b1; 0.57 per cell, <italic>n</italic> = 50 cells) versus DE-cad&#x02237;GFP and Arm&#x02237;GFP (3.18 &#x000b1; 1.49 and 3.56 &#x000b1; 1.37 per cell, respectively, <italic>n</italic> = 50 cells, P &#x0003c; 0.01). By late cellularization, Baz&#x02237;GFP localized primarily to apicolateral SAJs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 C</xref>, bracket), similar to DE-cad/Arm. We hypothesized that the DE-cad/Arm apical surface puncta might be SAJ precursors formed without Baz.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>DE-cad and Arm form puncta between apical surface microvilli.</bold> (A&#x02013;C) Deconvolved images over cellularization are shown.

A control transmembrane protein (mouse CD8&#x02237;GFP) had a smooth membrane distribution (unpublished data), arguing against DE-cad/Arm clustering via nonspecific effects on receptor diffusion. In fact, DE-cad/Arm puncta were quite dynamic, often moving to and from the center of the apical surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 D</xref>, arrow). To test cytoskeletal associations, we dual imaged DE-cad&#x02237;GFP with tubulin&#x02237;mCherry or actin&#x02237;RFP live. Basolateral MT bundles were seen (not depicted), but few MTs were at the apical surface, and these colocalized minimally with DE-cad&#x02237;GFP puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 E</xref>). Actin-RFP labeled apical microvilli that cover the apical surface during cellularization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Turner and Mahowald, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Grevengoed et al., 2003</xref>). At early to mid cellularization, surface views showed DE-cad&#x02237;GFP puncta between the microvilli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, F and G</xref>). Side views showed the puncta at the base of microvilli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3, F and G</xref>). By mid cellularization, the puncta also associated with microvilli at apical cell&#x02013;cell contacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 G</xref>).</p><p>To test how actin affects the DE-cad/Arm puncta, we dual imaged DE-cad&#x02237;GFP and actin&#x02237;RFP live after injecting latrunculin A at early cellularization. This first eliminated apical microvilli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 H</xref>) and then led to general cell shape loss. DE-cad&#x02237;GFP puncta cleared from the apical surface center with the same timing as the microvilli loss, apparently moving to the periphery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 H</xref>). Carrier controls had no effect (unpublished data). Thus, actin-based microvilli appear to position DE-cad/Arm puncta at the apical surface. Because contacts between actin-based protrusions promote cadherin&#x02013;catenin clustering in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adams et al., 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Vasioukhin et al., 2000</xref>), contacts between apical microvilli may similarly promote trans-cadherin interactions to form DE-cad/Arm puncta. Puncta formed at cell&#x02013;cell contacts could be direct precursors to SAJs.</p></sec><sec><title>The apical puncta enlarge, move basally, and join Baz to form SAJs</title><p>How do the apical puncta contribute to SAJs? 3D quantification of DE-cad&#x02237;GFP and Arm&#x02237;GFP puncta in the apical 12 &#x000b5;m of cells from mid to late cellularization showed a significant decrease in puncta number per cell (<italic>n</italic> = 5 embryos each, P &#x0003c; 0.01; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4, A and B</xref>) and a loss of smaller volume puncta (<italic>n</italic> = 5 embryos each, P &#x0003c; 0.01; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4, A and B</xref>). Many puncta became elongated and lined up along the z axis by late cellularization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4, A and B</xref>, arrows and brackets), suggesting puncta clustering. Analyzing individual puncta revealed mergers and fissions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 C</xref>, arrows). In 2-min periods between mid and late cellularization, 20/50 DE-cad&#x02237;GFP and 8/50 Arm&#x02237;GFP puncta merged, and 6/50 DE-cad&#x02237;GFP and 7/50 Arm&#x02237;GFP puncta split. Thus, the puncta interact dynamically, and a net tendency to merge may produce SAJs. Total BJ intensity was relatively low at mid cellularization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4, D and E</xref>) before the apical changes began, indicating that reorganization of mid cellularization apical puncta may be sufficient for forming late cellularization SAJs. Also, the total intensity of all puncta in the apical 12 &#x000b5;m did not increase from mid to late cellularization (an apparent drop for Arm&#x02237;GFP was statistically insignificant; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4, D and E</xref>).</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p><bold>DE-cad/Arm puncta cluster, reposition, and join Baz to form SAJs.</bold> (A and B) DE-cad&#x02237;GFP and Arm&#x02237;GFP puncta volumes (<italic>n</italic> = 5 embryos; apical, 12 &#x000b5;m).

At early mid cellularization, there was relatively equal apical and basal movement (55.7 &#x000b1; 14.3% basal vs. 43.8 &#x000b1; 14.4% apical, <italic>n</italic> = 8 embryos). At late cellularization, the displacements became mainly basal (77.1 &#x000b1; 11.9% basal vs. 22.3 &#x000b1; 12.0% apical, <italic>n</italic> = 8 embryos; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 G</xref>), which is a significant change (P &#x0003c; 0.01) directed toward SAJ assembly sites.</p><p>Contrasting DE-cad&#x02237;GFP and Arm&#x02237;GFP, low numbers of Baz&#x02237;GFP puncta existed per cell at mid cellularization, and puncta numbers and volumes significantly increased by late cellularization (<italic>n</italic> = 5 embryos each, P &#x0003c; 0.01; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 H</xref>). Late Baz&#x02237;GFP puncta numbers were similar to those for DE-cad&#x02237;GFP and Arm&#x02237;GFP, likely a result of colocalization at SAJs. The fewer earlier Baz&#x02237;GFP puncta correlated with the fewer Baz&#x02237;GFP puncta counted at the apical surface at these stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 C</xref>). To further test whether Baz has low overlap with apical surface DE-cad puncta, we generated and coexpressed Baz&#x02237;mCherry with DE-cad&#x02237;GFP. At mid cellularization, apical surface DE-cad&#x02237;GFP puncta rarely colocalized with Baz&#x02237;mCherry puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 I</xref>, arrows), which were mainly absent from the domain. DE-cad&#x02237;GFP puncta at peripheral, protrusive edges of the apical surface showed more overlap with Baz&#x02237;mCherry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 I</xref>, arrows), which was still relatively sparse at this position. In contrast, apicolateral SAJ assembly sites showed almost full colocalization of DE-cad&#x02237;GFP and Baz&#x02237;mCherry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 I</xref>, arrows). Thus, DE-cad/Arm puncta appear to form at the apical surface with minimal Baz association and then associate with Baz at SAJs.</p></sec><sec><title>Baz recruits the apical puncta into apicolateral SAJs</title><p>To test how Baz affects the DE-cad/Arm puncta, we imaged DE-cad&#x02237;GFP in <italic>baz</italic> maternal zygotic mutants live.

After cell number corrections (fewer <italic>baz</italic> mutant cells were present as a result of their flat morphology), three <italic>baz</italic> mutant embryos had WT puncta numbers per cell and two had very few puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 I</xref>). Overall, <italic>baz</italic> mutants had lower puncta volumes (P &#x0003c; 0.01, <italic>n</italic> = 5 embryos each) and less puncta elongation in the z axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 I</xref>, insets). As gastrulation began, <italic>baz</italic> mutant puncta were also more dynamic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 J</xref>, arrows). By &#x0223c;10 min into gastrulation, <italic>baz</italic> mutant cells often had large cell protrusions (7/7 embryos; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 K</xref>). By &#x0223c;20 min, large DE-cad&#x02013;positive vesicles arose (7/7 embryos; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 L</xref>, arrow). Thus, <italic>baz</italic> mutants fail at positioning DE-cad puncta and growing SAJs and subsequently lose epithelial structure and display elevated internal DE-cad.</p></sec><sec><title>SAJ assembly via higher order interactions between Baz and DE-cad/Arm clusters</title><p>Our data indicate that Baz and DE-cad/Arm form independent clusters that engage to form SAJs. Baz and DE-cad/Arm clusters are structurally distinct (with different protein numbers and dynamics). They arise in distinct ways both developmentally and within the cell. They are also genetically separable; apical surface DE-cad puncta can form in <italic>baz</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5, A and B</xref>), and apicolateral Baz puncta can form in AJ mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Harris and Peifer, 2004</xref>). This independent clustering may involve Baz homooligomerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Benton and St Johnston, 2003</xref>) and homophilic cis- and trans-cadherin interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gumbiner, 2005</xref>).</p><p>How do Baz puncta control the repositioning of DE-cad/Arm puncta? Direct transport is unlikely, as there are few Baz puncta or MTs at the apical surface. However, general basal plasma membrane flow occurs during cellularization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Lecuit and Wieschaus, 2000</xref>). Interestingly, we detected apical DE-cad&#x02237;GFP puncta moving basally during later cellularization when apical microvilli density decreases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Turner and Mahowald, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Grevengoed et al., 2003</xref>). Perhaps the puncta interact more extensively with dense early apical microvilli and thus resist membrane flow. Later, microvilli thinning may release more puncta to flow basally. We propose that Baz clusters act as molecular nets to catch and concentrate these DE-cad/Arm puncta at SAJ assembly sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 M</xref>).</p><p>Why reposition apical surface DE-cad/Arm puncta to the apicolateral region? Cell protrusions may have limited clustering ability. They can sweep receptors into clusters, but their movement could also break clusters apart, producing weak clustering cycles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 M</xref>). For example, early contacts form and break repeatedly in MDCK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">McNeill et al., 1993</xref>). In these cells, signaling to actin converts the dynamic protrusions into stable contacts for AJ growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Drees et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Yamada et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Yamada and Nelson, 2007</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, Baz appears to promote AJ growth in a distinct way by repositioning AJ puncta to separate assembly sites next to centrosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 M</xref>). Without Baz, DE-cad/Arm complexes appear trapped in weak clustering cycles leading to epithelial breakdown.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Fly stocks</title><p>FlyBase describes mutations and constructs (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://flybase.bio.indiana.edu">http://flybase.bio.indiana.edu</ext-link>).

A 2.2&#x02013;2.5-&#x000b5;m-wide line typically covering half a cell and spanning four to six cells in length was selected as the area for photobleaching. Two to three of these areas were simultaneously bleached for 1 s per field of view per embryo. The samples were continually imaged at a single z plane with a separate laser before, during, and after the photobleaching. Imaging was stopped after a clear recovery plateau was reached. Intensities of bleached SAJs that remained in the focal plane for the full recovery were measured using ImageJ (National Institutes of Health). These values were first corrected for background by subtracting a mean of three fluorescence values for areas of the same size outside of the embryo. To correct for general bleaching of the embryo from imaging, the values were divided by the total fluorescence of a square containing eight to ten cells outside the FRAP area. The corrected fluorescence intensities for the SAJs were normalized to the time point just before bleaching and were plotted using Excel (Microsoft). Recovery rates were calculated from the slopes of best-fit lines for the first 30 s after photobleaching. Immobile fractions and recovery half-times were calculated based on fluorescence levels at the recovery plateau versus the prebleach level and the level immediately after bleaching.

Adding the total relative cortical fluorescence from SAJs and IM gives the overall total relative cortical fluorescence of an average cell.</p><p>Next, we applied our counts of proteins per cell to these relative cortical fluorescence measurements. To determine the number of proteins per SAJ, the counts of proteins per cell were multiplied by the fraction of total relative cortical fluorescence caused by SAJs, and this was then divided by the number of SAJs per cell (this gave the number of proteins per SAJ from one cell). To determine the number of proteins in the IM, the counts of proteins per cell were multiplied by the fraction of total relative cortical fluorescence caused by IM. To determine the number of proteins in an area of IM equal to the area of an SAJ, we divided the number of proteins in the IM by the total area of the IM and then multiplied by the area of an SAJ.
