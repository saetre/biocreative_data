We have identified and characterized a mitochondrial membrane protein in yeast, Fcj1 (formation of CJ protein 1), which is specifically enriched in CJs. Cells lacking Fcj1 lack CJs, exhibit concentric stacks of inner membrane in the mitochondrial matrix, and show increased levels of F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub>&#x02013;ATP synthase (F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub>) supercomplexes. Overexpression of Fcj1 leads to increased CJ formation, branching of cristae, enlargement of CJ diameter, and reduced levels of F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub> supercomplexes. Impairment of F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub> oligomer formation by deletion of its subunits <italic>e</italic>/<italic>g</italic> (Su <italic>e</italic>/<italic>g</italic>) causes CJ diameter enlargement and reduction of cristae tip numbers and promotes cristae branching. Fcj1 and Su <italic>e</italic>/<italic>g</italic> genetically interact. We propose a model in which the antagonism between Fcj1 and Su <italic>e</italic>/<italic>g</italic> locally modulates the F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub> oligomeric state, thereby controlling membrane curvature of cristae to generate CJs and cristae tips.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mitochondria are ubiquitous organelles and fulfill a multitude of crucial functions in eukaryotic organisms. Mitochondria are made up by two membranes: the outer membrane (OM) and the inner membrane (IM). The IM is composed of two subdomains: the inner boundary membrane (IBM) and the cristae membrane (CM). The IBM is closely apposed to the OM, both forming a double-layered envelope of the organelle. CMs are invaginations of the IBM that protrude into the matrix space. Large variations exist in the morphology of CMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Munn, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fawcett, 1981</xref>; for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zick et al., 2009</xref>), and aberrant mitochondrial structures have been described for numerous pathological situations in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">DiMauro et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wallace, 2005</xref>). Tubular-, lamellar-, and even triangle-shaped structures of the CM have been observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fawcett, 1981</xref>). Cristae are connected to the IBM by narrow tubular- or slotlike structures of varying length, so-called crista junctions (CJs), as revealed by EM of serial sections of mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Daems and Wisse, 1966</xref>) and by electron tomography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mannella et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Perkins et al., 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nicastro et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Frey et al., 2002</xref>; for reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Frey and Mannella, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mannella et al., 2001</xref>). The diameter of CJs was found to be rather small, ranging from 12 to 40 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nicastro et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Perkins et al., 2003</xref>; for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Frey and Mannella, 2000</xref>). This led to the suggestion of CJs forming barriers for the movement of proteins and metabolites between the intracristal and the intermembrane space as well as between the CM and the IBM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mannella et al., 1994</xref>). Such a role of CJs has been proposed to have important consequences for the regulation of oxidative phosphorylation, as a barrier of this kind might limit the diffusion of metabolites like ADP into the intracristal space and modulate the pH gradient across the IM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Perkins et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Renken et al., 2002</xref>; for reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mannella et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mannella, 2006a</xref>). Also, subcompartmentalization of the IM was suggested based on biochemical subfractionation of mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Werner and Neupert, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pon et al., 1989</xref>), localization of individual mitochondrial proteins by immuno-EM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gilkerson et al., 2003</xref>), or fluorescence microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wurm and Jakobs, 2006</xref>). Recently, this subcompartmentalization was addressed by determining the distribution of 20 mitochondrial proteins using quantitative immuno-EM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vogel et al., 2006</xref>). The IBM appears to be segregated from the CM by the CJ, yet proteins are able to dynamically redistribute between the two subcompartments of the IM depending on the physiological state of the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vogel et al., 2006</xref>). Furthermore, CJs undergo remodeling during apoptosis; this was suggested to allow release of the intracristal pool of cytochrome <italic>c</italic> to the cytoplasm, thereby triggering programmed cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Scorrano et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cipolat et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Frezza et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Despite the apparent importance of the structural organization of mitochondria, the components responsible for the morphology and biogenesis of cristae, and in particular of CJs, are largely unknown. Deletion of the dimer-specific subunit <italic>e</italic> (Su <italic>e</italic>) or Su <italic>g</italic> of the F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub>&#x02013;ATP synthase (F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub>) leads to defective oligomerization of this complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arnold et al., 1998</xref>) and to altered cristae morphology with extended onion-like structures in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Paumard et al., 2002</xref>). Furthermore, remodeling of CJs during apoptosis was reported to depend on the mitochondrial dynamin-like protein OPA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Frezza et al., 2006</xref>). Prohibitins were recently suggested to play a role in cristae morphogenesis by controlling OPA1 processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Merkwirth et al., 2008</xref>). The yeast orthologue of OPA1, Mgm1, was proposed to be required for cristae maintenance in addition to its role in IM fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wong et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Meeusen et al., 2006</xref>). Another protein reported to determine cristae morphology in human cells is mitofilin. Down-regulation of this protein led to massive proliferation of the IM, resulting in multiple layers that appear to be interconnected accompanied by a disappearance of CJs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">John et al., 2005</xref>). Mitofilin was initially named heart muscle protein, as it is highly expressed in rat heart tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Icho et al., 1994</xref>). Proteomic analysis of human heart mitochondria further indicated high abundance of this protein in mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Taylor et al., 2003</xref>). The name mitofilin was coined because of its colocalization with filament-like mitochondria in fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Odgren et al., 1996</xref>).</p><p>In summary, a few proteins are known to influence cristae morphology, but, so far, no protein has been shown to be specifically localized to CJs or to be part of a CJ protein complex. In this study, we investigated the molecular basis governing the architecture of cristae and CJs in mitochondria of the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>. We describe ultrastructural alterations of the IM of yeast mitochondria lacking the open reading frame <italic>AIM28</italic> (<italic>YKR016w/FMP13</italic>) with hitherto unknown function. This gene was recently listed as a putative orthologue of mammalian mitofilin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Olichon et al., 2006</xref>). We provide both morphological and biochemical evidence that this protein is directly involved in the formation and molecular structure of CJs and is specifically enriched at CJs. We propose to name it Fcj1 (formation of CJ protein 1). Fcj1 regulates the oligomeric state of the F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub> supercomplex in an adverse manner, and, moreover, CJ formation and structure turn out to be dependent on F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub> supercomplex formation itself. Furthermore, Su <italic>e</italic> and Su <italic>g</italic> of F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub>, which promote oligomerization of F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub>, are essential for the formation of endings of cristae, the tips, or rims. The F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub> complex has been proposed to represent a key element in the determination of cristae structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Paumard et al., 2002</xref>), a proposal which rests on its very high abundance in the mitochondrial IM. In this study, we present a working model that explains the control of cristae architecture by the antagonistic effects of Fcj1 and F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub> Su <italic>e</italic> and Su <italic>g</italic> on the oligomeric state of F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Deletion of Fcj1 leads to altered mitochondrial morphology and partial loss of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA)</title><p>In a search for genes affecting mitochondrial structure, we analyzed a collection of yeast cells that showed deficiency in growth on nonfermentable carbon sources because mutants with this phenotype are often accompanied by alterations in mitochondrial structure. We focused on genes coding for putative mitochondrial proteins that, so far, do not have an assigned function. Possible candidate strains were checked for mitochondrial morphology by rhodamine staining and then by expression of matrix-targeted GFP. We identified a mutant that showed alterations in the typical mitochondrial network. In the strain lacking the open reading frame <italic>FCJ1</italic> (<italic>AIM28/FMP13/YKR016w</italic>), abnormally large spherical mitochondria were observed. These were mostly located in the periphery of the cell and formed atypical networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>). In addition, mitochondria occasionally appeared hollow. For further characterization, we determined the percentage of rho<sup>0</sup>/rho<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cells. Depending on the cell density and the growth medium used, this value varied from 15 to 40% for the mutant cells. The respiratory rates of isolated mitochondria from such cells in state III (+ADP) and state IV (&#x02212;ADP) and the maximal uncoupled rates were reduced by 30% as compared with wild type (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>). The membrane potential, &#x00394;&#x003c8;, of the mutant mitochondria was also reduced compared with wild type, although to a lesser extent (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table I</xref>). The respiratory control ratio (state III/state IV rates) in the mutant was not altered, indicating that the respiratory chain and the ATP synthase were still well coupled. Taking all of these observations into account, compromised respiration in the mutant cells was rather caused by a secondary loss of mtDNA than by primary deficiencies of enzymatic activities involved in oxidative phosphorylation.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Fcj1 is required for normal mitochondrial morphology.</bold> (A) Wild-type (WT) and <italic>&#x00394;fcj1</italic> cells expressing mitochondria-targeted GFP were grown on nonfermentable medium and visualized by fluorescence microscopy.

In silico analysis by the MitoProt II program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Claros and Vincens, 1996</xref>) yielded a high probability for mitochondrial targeting (0.9967), including a predicted cleavage site of the mitochondrial processing peptidase between positions 16 and 17 and a possible site of the mitochondrial intermediate peptidase between residues 24 and 25 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>). Furthermore, Fcj1 contains a predicted single transmembrane segment close to the N terminus. Fcj1 shares 13% sequence identity with human mitofilin and 12% with mouse mitofilin. At the C terminus, it contains a short segment of higher similarity (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200811099/DC1">Fig. S1</ext-link>). Several structural features such as the position of the transmembrane segment, a coiled-coil domain, and the conserved C-terminal domain argue for Fcj1 being a member of the mitofilin protein family.</p><p>Upon subcellular fractionation, Fcj1 was completely recovered in the mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>). Incubation of isolated mitochondria with proteinase K (PK) did not lead to degradation of Fcj1; however, after selective opening of the OM, Fcj1 was degraded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>). Treatment of mitochondria with either high salt or Na carbonate did not result in extraction of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 E</xref>). To test whether Fcj1 can form oligomeric structures, two differently C-terminally tagged variants of Fcj1, a His-tagged (Fcj1-His<sub>6</sub>) and a tandem affinity purification (TAP)&#x02013;tagged variant (Fcj1-TAP), were coexpressed in yeast. Upon TAP affinity chromatography, Fcj1-His<sub>6</sub> was copurified with Fcj1-TAP, indicating that Fcj1 undergoes homotypic interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 F</xref>). Affinity purification of Fcj1-His<sub>12</sub> from <italic>&#x00394;fcj1</italic> + <italic>Fcj1-His<sub>12</sub></italic> mitochondria solubilized in Triton X-100 did not lead to copurification of proteins other than Fcj1-His<sub>12</sub> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200811099/DC1">Fig. S2 A</ext-link>). The size of the Fcj1-His<sub>12</sub> complex in Triton X-100&#x02013;solubilized mitochondria was &#x0223c;180 kD, as determined by size exclusion chromatography (SEC). Moreover, the complex retained its size after affinity purification, which is consistent with the formation of a stable homo-oligomeric complex (Fig. S2 B). The size would suggest a trimeric complex; however, a dimeric or tetrameric complex seems possible as well. We also analyzed the size of the Fcj1 complex after TAP from mitochondria harboring Fcj1-His<sub>6</sub> and Fcj1-TAP. The size of the Fcj1-TAP&#x02013;Fcj1-His<sub>6</sub> complex was shifted to a molecular mass of &#x0223c;320 kD or &#x0223c;220 kD depending on the detection of the TAP tag or the His tag, respectively (Fig. S2 C). This increase in molecular mass is consistent with the presence of one or more subunits of Fcj1 containing the 20-kD TAP tag, further strengthening the view of a homo-oligomeric Fcj1 complex. Collectively, Fcj1 is a protein engaged in homotypic interactions that is anchored to the mitochondrial IM with its major part exposed to the intermembrane space.</p></sec><sec><title>Fcj1 is enriched at CJs</title><p>We determined the distribution of Fcj1 over the various subdomains of the IM using quantitative immuno-EM.

Gold particles present in a large number of sections of wild-type cells were projected on a model, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vogel et al., 2006</xref>), representing OM, IBM, CM, and a CJ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, A and B</xref>). Fcj1 was most prominently clustered in close proximity to the CJ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, A and B</xref>), a region which, so far, was rather characterized by a quite low density of numerous other mitochondrial proteins (for comparison see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vogel et al. [2006]</xref>). A region nearly lacking gold particles was observed in the CM adjacent to the CJ region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>). This necklike region represents the narrow tubular segment of the CM, exhibiting a relatively high positive membrane curvature. The curvature here is opposite to the one at the base of CJs. Fcj1 was present to some extent in the remainder of the CM, including the cristae tips and in the IBM distant from the CJ region. The term cristae tip refers to its appearance in electron micrographs of mitochondrial sections. Depending on the section plane, they represent the highly positively curved rims of lamellar-like CM sheets. To evaluate these findings in a quantitative way, a sliding window was moved along the IM of our model starting from the bottom, counting only gold particles that were located within 14-nm distance from the IM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, C and D</xref>). This was performed for Fcj1 and as a control for Cox2, a subunit of cytochrome <italic>c</italic> oxidase, as well as for Su <italic>e</italic> and Su <italic>g</italic> of F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, C and D</xref>; raw data for Cox2 and Su <italic>e</italic> and Su <italic>g</italic> were taken from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vogel et al. [2006]</xref>). With Fcj1, the highest number of gold particles was observed in the region corresponding to the CJ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, C and D</xref>, gray boxes). The number of gold particles representing Cox2 was very low in the CJ and IBM region and increased in the CM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vogel et al., 2006</xref>). Su <italic>e</italic> and Su <italic>g</italic> of F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub> were not enriched in the CJ region but rather appeared accumulated in the cristae tips (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 D</xref>). Collectively, the enrichment of Fcj1 at CJs was unique and not observed for any of the proteins analyzed previously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, C and D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vogel et al., 2006</xref>). The presence of Fcj1 in lower amounts in the planar parts of the cristae, where the levels of Su <italic>e</italic> and Su <italic>g</italic> are also intermediate, could reflect a balance of function in these regions; in part, they could also be caused by the topological complexity of bent cristae and perhaps, to a lesser degree, by background signals. Altogether, our data demonstrate that Fcj1 is the only protein identified so far specifically enriched at CJs at sites where the amounts of Su <italic>e</italic> and Su <italic>g</italic> are relatively low.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Fcj1 is enriched at CJs.</bold> (A) Immunogold labeling of Fcj1 in wild-type cells.

These high molecular mass complexes of F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub> represent a small subpopulation of the soluble fraction. They were very stable even at high digitonin to protein ratios when Fcj1 was lacking but not when Fcj1 was present. Overexpression of Fcj1 impaired the formation of these higher oligomers markedly and also decreased the amount of the tetrameric forms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 C</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200811099/DC1">Fig. S5 A</ext-link>). The amount of dimers and monomers was not affected significantly. Likewise, the abundance of higher oligomers of F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub> when determined by SEC was dependent on the presence of Fcj1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Fig. 7 D</xref>). The majority of Fcj1 was recovered in the fractions corresponding to the higher oligomeric forms of F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub> (&#x0003e;2 MD), showing that Fcj1 is present in a high molecular mass complex. Thus, the size of F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub> oligomers was considerably larger upon solubilization with digitonin as compared with solubilization with Triton X-100 (Fig. S2). Collectively, various lines of evidence, including biochemical data as well as EM tomography, show that Fcj1 affects the stability of F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub> oligomers in an adverse manner but obviously does not influence that of the dimers of this complex.</p></sec><sec><title>Fcj1 acts in an antagonistic manner to Su <italic>e</italic> and Su <italic>g</italic> of the F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub>&#x02013;ATP synthase</title><p>The observed effect of Fcj1 on the stability of oligomeric forms of F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub> suggested a functional link between these proteins. Su <italic>e</italic> and Su <italic>g</italic> are known to be required for dimerization/oligomerization of F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub> and are required for normal cristae morphology. To determine whether there exists a genetic interaction between these subunits and Fcj1, we determined the doubling times on a nonfermentable carbon source of each single and corresponding double deletion strain. The strain lacking Fcj1 was most severely impaired in growth on a nonfermentable carbon source, showing a &#x0223c;1.75-fold longer doubling time as compared with wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 A</xref>). Additional deletion of either Su <italic>e</italic> or Su <italic>g</italic> of F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub> led to an efficient suppression of the growth defect of the <italic>&#x00394;fcj1</italic> strain. These double deletion strains had significantly shorter doubling times than the <italic>&#x00394;fcj1</italic> strain. This was further confirmed by drop dilution growth tests (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 B</xref>). In conclusion, these data demonstrate a genetic interaction of Fcj1 with Su <italic>e</italic>/Su <italic>g</italic> of F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub>, placing all proteins in the same pathway. The latter subunits are promoting the assembly of F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub>&#x02013;ATP synthase oligomers, whereas Fcj1 has the opposite effect. In the double deletion strains (<italic>&#x00394;fcj1/&#x00394;su e</italic> and <italic>&#x00394;fcj1/&#x00394;su g</italic>), the formation of F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub>&#x02013;ATP synthase oligomers was not observed (Fig. S5 B).

Cristae tips per mitochondrial section were &#x0223c;2.5-fold more abundant in sections of <italic>&#x00394;fcj1</italic> cells than in wild type (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table II</xref>).</p><p>Mitochondria of strains lacking Su <italic>e</italic> or Su <italic>g</italic> were reported to contain onion-like structures and extended CMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Paumard et al., 2002</xref>), but it was not investigated whether formation of CJs is affected. Therefore, we performed a quantitative analysis of CJs in these strains. Next to onion-like structures, we observed CJs in these strains, and the numbers of CJs per mitochondrial section were modestly increased compared with those in the corresponding wild type (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table II</xref>). Thus, Su <italic>e</italic> and Su <italic>g</italic> are not essential for CJ formation. However, CJs often appeared in pairs and were connected via CMs crossing a mitochondrial section, which is a structure rarely observed in wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8, C and D</xref>; and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table II</xref>). In line with this observation, the number of cristae tips per mitochondrial section observed in <italic>&#x00394;su e</italic> and <italic>&#x00394;su g</italic> mitochondria was extremely low, &#x0223c;20 times lower than in wild type (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table II</xref>). Moreover, branching of cristae was found in 27% and 9% of mitochondrial sections of <italic>&#x00394;su e</italic> and <italic>&#x00394;su g</italic> strains, respectively, but not in sections of the corresponding wild-type strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8, C and D</xref>). Furthermore, the mean diameters of CJs in <italic>&#x00394;su e</italic> and <italic>&#x00394;su g</italic> cells were increased, although to a smaller extent than in cells with overexpressed Fcj1, and showed a high variation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 E</xref> and not depicted). In wild-type cells, a slightly lower mean CJ diameter was measured when compared with the wild-type control shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 B</xref>. We attribute this to different growth media (selective minimal vs. complete media) and strain backgrounds (W303 vs. BY4742; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200811099/DC1">Table S2</ext-link>).

These mitochondria were characterized by the presence of internal, concentric or vesicle-like CMs and the virtual absence of CJs (Fig. S5, C amd D). In conclusion, Su <italic>e</italic> and Su <italic>g</italic>, on the one hand, promote the formation of cristae tips, and Fcj1, on the other hand, is necessary for formation of CJs. These two types of mitochondrial membrane proteins modulate the oligomeric state of F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub> in an antagonistic manner. This suggests that the architecture of the cristae with its elements of the cristae endings, connections with the IBM, and perhaps also the planar arrangement of cristae sheets are controlled by the local concentrations of these two types of antagonistic proteins.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study addresses the question of how the complex structure of cristae in mitochondria is determined on a molecular basis. In this study, we report on proteins that, in conjunction with F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub>&#x02013;ATP synthase, determine cristae architecture. The IM protein Fcj1 plays an essential role in the formation of CJs and cristae shape. Su <italic>e</italic> and Su <italic>g</italic> of F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub>, whose depletion was previously shown to lead to onion-like cristae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Paumard et al., 2002</xref>), have an influence on cristae structure, which is opposing that of Fcj1. We present a model of how these components determine the structure of the various parts of cristae, which is based on our results as discussed in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9, A and B</xref>).</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><p><bold>Working model of the formation of cristae and CJs in mitochondria.</bold> (A) Schematic representation of membrane curvatures at distinct regions of the CM and of the submitochondrial localization of Fcj1 and Su <italic>e</italic> and Su <italic>g</italic> in wild-type mitochondria.

An overview of a representative cristae sheet with one CJ is shown in side view (left) or as a cross section after 90&#x000b0; rotation (middle).

(B) Schematic representation of membrane curvature in CM structures observed in the indicated mutant mitochondria. Upon depletion of Fcj1, positive curvatures of the CM are predominating, whereas membrane structures that require negative bending of the membrane are absent. The lack of Su <italic>e</italic>/Su <italic>g</italic> leads to an apparent reduction in positive membrane curvatures, which results in an enlargement of CJ diameter, branching of cristae, and a strong reduction in the number of apparent cristae tips. Increased levels of Fcj1 produce a similar phenotype. However, the formation of cristae tips is not affected in this mutant. ICS, intracristal space; M, matrix space.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JCB_200811099_RGB_Fig9"/></fig><p>Fcj1 is anchored to the IM by a single N-terminal transmembrane segment, exposing the major part of the protein to the intermembrane space. It undergoes homotypic interactions and is quite abundant with an estimated number of 5,730 molecules per cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ghaemmaghami et al., 2003</xref>). Yet, it is much less abundant than the major constituent of the IM, the F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub>&#x02013;ATP synthase with an estimated number of 41,500 and 164,000 molecules for the F1&#x003b1; and F1&#x003b2; subunits, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ghaemmaghami et al., 2003</xref>). The mammalian protein mitofilin shares very low sequence similarity with Fcj1; however, it is likely to represent an orthologue on the basis of its depletion phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">John et al., 2005</xref>). Fcj1 is present at high levels at the base of CJs but is also present in other parts of cristae, although to a lesser extent. Deletion of Fcj1 leads to a loss of CJs. Overexpression results in an increase of the number of CJs and to internal branching of cristae, suggesting a direct role of Fcj1 in the formation of junctions. Fcj1 has a regulatory influence on the oligomeric state of F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub>. Deletion of Fcj1 leads to an increase in the level of F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub> supercomplexes. This effect is also apparent upon morphological analysis of mitochondria lacking Fcj1. Cryo-EM revealed the formation of extensive F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub> supercomplex structures in the matrix space between cristae of this strain. Consistent with these observations, overexpression of Fcj1 leads to a reduction of the level of F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub> supercomplexes.</p><p>Manipulation of the levels of the F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub> Su <italic>e</italic> and Su <italic>g</italic> yielded equally intriguing results. As previously documented, depletion of these subunits leads to accumulation of concentric cristae structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Paumard et al., 2002</xref>). Deletion of either Su <italic>e</italic> or Su <italic>g</italic> has been reported to strongly favor the dissociation of the F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub> into monomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arnold et al., 1998</xref>). Remarkably, this has no effect on the enzymatic activity of the ATP synthase. In this study, we show that these mitochondria contain CJs but exhibit a virtual absence of cristae tips. This goes along with a strongly increased number of bridgelike cristae that extend across whole sections of mitochondria, ending on both sides in CJs. Moreover, branching of cristae is observed in these mitochondria, much like in Fcj1-overexpressing cells. Thus, branching of cristae may represent internal CJs that emerge within a planar region of the cristae, a region in which CJs are normally absent.</p><p>In summary, our data show opposing functions of Fcj1 in relation to F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub> Su <italic>e</italic> and Su <italic>g</italic>. Fcj1 is obviously critical for formation of CJs, whereas formation of cristae tips requires Su <italic>e</italic> and Su <italic>g</italic>. This is in line with the specific enrichment of these components within the respective regions of the IM, as revealed by quantitative immunogold labeling. It appears to be their relative distribution that determines cristae structure in mitochondria.</p><p>Building on our results, we propose a working hypothesis for the molecular basis of the generation of CJs and cristae tips. In the mitochondria of most species and organs, the following structural elements can be discriminated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9, A and B</xref>). The cristae sheets are made up of two leaves of IM arranged in close apposition, leaving a narrow intermembrane space in between. These sheets are delimitated by tips or rims, in which the lipid bilayer is bending over, showing a strong positive curvature. At their base, the cristae are connected to the IBM, which forms a kind of second envelope tightly apposed to the OM. These connections, the CJs, have a rather complex 3D architecture. At the base where they open out into the IBM, the membrane exhibits negative curvature. It is followed by a narrow tubular neck region with highly positive curvature. This structure widens out into the planes of the cristae, a region in which both negative and positive curvatures are present.</p><p>According to our model, Fcj1 directly or indirectly interferes with the formation of higher oligomers and thereby favors negative membrane bending. By this mechanism, the presence of Fcj1 affects the building of the bases of CJs. However, in the regions where the formation of higher oligomeric forms of F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub> is not disturbed, these oligomers impose a positive curvature on the membrane and thereby favor the formation of cristae tips. The idea of F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub> oligomers introducing a positive curvature to the IM and leading to tip formation has also been put forward in a recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Strauss et al., 2008</xref>). Our findings attribute this effect to the action of Su <italic>e</italic> and Su <italic>g</italic>. As we show in this study, they are both enriched in the rim region, and their absence leads to a virtual absence of cristae tips. However, their lower abundance in CJs supports negative curvature. Interestingly, Fcj1 is present in very low amounts in cristae necks, the IM region connecting the base of CJ with the cristae sheets. This membrane has an extremely high positive curvature. Thus, we suggest that the ratios of Fcj1 to Su <italic>e</italic>/Su <italic>g</italic> are decisive in shaping cristae. The sheets of cristae appear to contain both Fcj1 and Su <italic>e</italic>/Su <italic>g</italic>, and this may determine their planar shape. A balanced distribution of these antagonistic components may also be necessary for the dynamics and fission/fusion of cristae. A dynamic nature of cristae was proposed previously (for reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mannella et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mannella, 2006b</xref>) based on EM tomography studies of isolated mitochondria showing that cristae morphology apparently is reversibly changing under various physiological conditions (for reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mannella et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mannella, 2006b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zick et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Altogether, our hypothesis can explain all of the findings presented in this study and in other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Paumard et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Strauss et al., 2008</xref>). It does not exclude that other components such as prohibitins or OPA1 or others yet to be identified also contribute to CJ and cristae tip formation (for reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Merkwirth and Langer, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zick et al., 2009</xref>). Also, it raises several intriguing questions such as how Fcj1 is recruited to the base of the CJ. Fcj1 itself or a possible reaction partner may interact with the OM and thereby anchor CJs to the OM. Of particular interest are the physical details of Fcj1 and Su <italic>e</italic>/Su <italic>g</italic> interaction with F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>O</sub> and how these interactions regulate membrane curvature. Finally, an intriguing aspect is the obvious problem of how cristae stacks are formed when CJs are lacking and how protein import and complex assembly in the CM occurs in this situation. One possibility would be that there is a rapid fusion/fission mechanism of cristae to and from the IBM. The life time of these connections might be too short lived to be seen by EM but long enough for diffusion of newly inserted proteins and lipids. Several other explanations may seem equally possible. In any case, it will be a great challenge to find out how mitochondria can survive the virtual complete absence of CJs and still maintain mitochondrial function and inheritance.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Strains and growth conditions</title><p>The strains and plasmids used are listed in Tables S2 and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200811099/DC1">S3</ext-link>.

The location of gold particles in mitochondria with clearly resolvable CMs connected by CJs to the IBM was plotted onto a single empirically determined model. To quantitatively determine the relative density of a protein along the IM, the number of gold particles within a 14-nm distance for all points on the IM was determined by moving in silico along the IM in the model from the bottom to the top of the model. CJ diameters were measured in electron micrographs of whole yeast cells prepared by the Tokuyasu method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tokuyasu, 1989</xref>).

Low electron-dose series (4,000&#x02013;5,000 electrons/nm<sup>2</sup>) of typically 60&#x02013;70 images were recorded using the Digital Micrograph package (Gatan GmbH) in tilt ranges between &#x000b1;60&#x000b0; and &#x000b1;70&#x000b0;, with 2&#x000b0; tilt intervals, at nominal magnifications of 43,000 (0.82 nm/pixel) or 52,000 (0.68 nm/pixel), and with an objective lens defocus of 6&#x02013;10 &#x000b5;m. Chemically preserved material was imaged under similar conditions, but the areas selected for recording of tomographic tilt series were preirradiated with electron doses of &#x0003e;10,000 electrons/nm<sup>2</sup>. Images of tilt series were aligned using fiducial markers and merged in 3D reconstructions by weighted back-projection using the EM image processing package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hegerl, 1996</xref>) as well as the translocase of the mitochondrial OM package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nickell et al., 2005</xref>) for postprocessing the volumes. The final thickness of EM tomograms was between 300 and 500 nm.
