DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) represent the most toxic chromosomal lesion, arising from a variety of sources such as ionizing radiation (IR) or collapsed replication forks. To counteract the potentially deleterious effects of DSBs, cells have evolved homologous recombination (HR)&#x02013;based repair mechanisms capable of restoring genomic integrity in an error-free manner and that rely on the availability of an undamaged homologous sister chromatid as a template for the repair process.</p><p>A key event in HR repair is the formation of a nucleofilament of the rate-limiting recombinase Rad51, wrapped around single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) generated in the vicinity of the DSB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">San Filippo et al., 2008</xref>). The Rad51/ssDNA nucleofilament catalyzes a search for a homologous sequence on the sister chromatid and promotes DNA strand invasion to initiate the repair process. Despite its importance for preserving genomic integrity, HR repair must be tightly controlled. Unrestricted HR activity is a hallmark of genetic disorders such as Bloom (BLM) and Werner syndromes, both of which display a hyper-recombination phenotype and genomic instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Sung and Klein, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Branzei and Foiani, 2007</xref>). To restrict HR, cells harbor proteins termed anti-recombinases. In budding yeast, the Srs2 helicase has such a function, preventing spontaneous and unscheduled HR by dismantling Rad51 from ssDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Krejci et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Veaute et al., 2003</xref>). In humans, the genes mutated in BLM, Werner, and Rothmund-Thomson (RecQL4) syndromes also encode helicases belonging to the RecQ family, all of which exhibit anti-recombinase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Wu and Hickson, 2006</xref>). BLM dissociates Rad51/ssDNA nucleofilaments, thereby suppressing HR, a function that was also reported for the helicase RecQL5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bugreev et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Hu et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>The existence of several helicases with anti-recombinogenic properties in mammalian cells suggests a considerable degree of complexity and redundancy in HR regulation. Recently, a functional homologue of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> Srs2, RTEL1, was identified in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barber et al., 2008</xref>). Fbh1, another conserved helicase with similarity to Srs2, has also been proposed to be a functional homologue of Srs2 in fission yeast and higher eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chiolo et al., 2007</xref>), but so far little is known about the function of Fbh1. Fbh1 belongs to the UvrD family of helicases and has 3&#x02032;&#x02013;5&#x02032; DNA-unwinding activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Kim et al., 2004</xref>). Moreover, Fbh1 is a putative E3 ubiquitin ligase by virtue of a conserved F box, enabling it to potentially function as an adaptor for the Skp, Cullin, F box&#x02013;containing complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Kim et al., 2004</xref>). However, at present, its ubiquitylation targets are unknown. In <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>, Fbh1 knockout leads to increased sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Morishita et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Osman et al., 2005</xref>). Chicken DT40 cells ablated for Fbh1 exhibit an overall mild phenotype yet display an elevated rate of sister chromatid exchange (SCE), which is a phenomenon associated with hyper recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Kohzaki et al., 2007</xref>). In these cells, Fbh1 acts redundantly with BLM, and their codisruption causes a synergistic increase in DNA damage sensitivity.</p><p>In this study, we have performed a detailed analysis of the functional properties of Fbh1 in human cells. We show that human Fbh1 (hFbh1) possesses both pro- and anti-recombinogenic activities, contributing to the regulation of ssDNA production at replication blocks as well as regulation of Rad51 nucleofilament formation and HR repair. Our findings reveal evolutionary conservancy of Fbh1 function and broaden the spectrum of anti-recombinogenic helicases in mammalian cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><sec><title>hFbh1 accumulates at sites of DNA damage</title><p>To investigate whether Fbh1 plays a role in the DNA damage response in human cells, we examined the impact of DNA-damaging insults on the subcellular localization of hFbh1. Because high levels of hFbh1 appeared toxic to cells (unpublished data), we generated a U2OS cell line stably expressing GFP-tagged hFbh1 in a doxycycline (DOX)-inducible fashion at low levels, which did not detectably interfere with cell proliferation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200812138/DC1">Fig. S1 A</ext-link>). In this cell line, GFP-hFbh1 showed uniform nuclear staining upon induction in the absence of exogenous DNA damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>). However, in response to DSBs generated by IR or laser microirradiation or replication blocks elicited by treatment with hydroxyurea (HU), GFP-hFbh1 accumulated in discrete subnuclear foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>), which is similar to the behavior of a range of DNA damage&#x02013;responsive proteins. The GFP-hFbh1 foci completely colocalized with the ssDNA-binding protein replication protein A (RPA) but only partially overlapped with &#x003b3;-H2AX, a marker for DSBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>). The formation of GFP-hFbh1 foci in response to IR was restricted to S and G2 phases, the cell cycle stages permissive for HR, as their formation occurred only in cyclin A&#x02013;positive cells and included BrdU-incorporating S phase cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>). In response to HU, the kinetics of GFP-hFbh1 focus formation paralleled that of RPA, becoming apparent &#x0223c;30 min after exposure to the drug (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>). Similar kinetics of GFP-hFbh1 recruitment was observed in response to IR (Fig. S1 B). These observations suggest that hFbh1 is a novel factor involved in the DNA damage response in human cells, functioning at an advanced stage associated with ssDNA formation.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>hFbh1 accumulates at sites of DNA damage in S and G2 phase cells.</bold> (A) U2OS/GFP-hFbh1 WT cells were induced to express GFP-hFbh1 by addition of DOX for 24 h, and were subsequently left untreated or subjected to laser microirradiation, IR (6 Gy), or HU treatment. 1 h later, the cells were fixed and coimmunostained with antibodies to RPA and &#x003b3;-H2AX.

To investigate the requirements for hFbh1 recruitment to DNA lesions, we first assessed the impact of depleting different proteins involved in processing damaged DNA. Knockdown of CtIP, a factor required for resection of DSBs into ssDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Sartori et al., 2007</xref>), severely impaired GFP-hFbh1 focus formation in response to IR but not HU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>), which generates ssDNA independent of resection. This suggested that hFbh1 is recruited to ssDNA but not unprocessed DSBs. To determine whether hFbh1 recruitment to damaged DNA required DNA intermediates produced after strand invasion during HR, we depleted Rad51 or Rad51C, a Rad51 mediator essential for Rad51 focus formation after DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Rodrigue et al., 2006</xref>). Although the Rad51 and Rad51C siRNAs depleted their targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>), such treatments did not interfere with GFP-hFbh1 recruitment in response to either IR or HU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>), suggesting that hFbh1 is directly recruited to ssDNA rather than recombination intermediates.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>hFbh1 interacts with ssDNA.</bold> (A) U2OS/GFP-hFbh1 WT cells were transfected with the indicated siRNAs for 24 h, induced with DOX for an additional 24 h, and exposed to IR or HU for 1 h.

Under these conditions, GFP-hFbh1 completely colocalized with the BrdU-decorated ssDNA compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>), supporting the notion that hFbh1 associates with ssDNA. To see whether hFbh1 directly binds ssDNA, we performed electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) in which purified GST-hFbh1 was incubated with ssDNA or double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) probes. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>, hFbh1 bound to ssDNA but not to dsDNA. Although hFbh1 recruitment to ssDNA regions generated by IR was restricted to S and G2 phases, we observed that GFP-hFbh1 accumulated at UV-damaged DNA in a subset of cyclin A&#x02013;negative cells (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200812138/DC1">Fig. S2 A</ext-link>). However, we failed to detect accumulation of GFP-Fbh1 at UV lesions in early G1 cells after mitotic shake off (Fig. S2 B). We conclude from these experiments that hFbh1 may be recruited to ssDNA produced in late G1 but not in early G1.</p></sec><sec><title>hFbh1 displaces Rad51 from chromatin to suppress HR</title><p>Evidence from yeast and other organisms suggests that Srs2 and the RecQ helicases possess anti-recombinogenic activities by dismantling the Rad51 nucleofilament from ssDNA produced during normal replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Sung and Klein, 2006</xref>). We tested whether hFbh1 might similarly prevent Rad51 focus formation after a replication block using the inducible GFP-hFbh1 cell line. As expected, Rad51 readily accumulated in nuclear foci when uninduced cells were treated with HU or IR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>). Strikingly, however, induction of GFP-hFbh1 in these cells strongly impaired Rad51 foci formation in response to HU and IR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>). Expression of Rad51 was unaffected by induction of GFP-hFbh1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref>), arguing against the possibility that hFbh1, a potential E3 ubiquitin ligase, inhibits Rad51 focus formation by targeting it for proteasomal degradation. Unlike total levels of Rad51, cellular fractionation experiments demonstrated that the HU-dependent increase in chromatin-associated Rad51 was suppressed by induction of GFP-hFbh1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref>). Moreover, GFP-hFbh1 led to an increase in chromatin-bound RPA after HU treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>), indicating that the ability of GFP-hFbh1 to prevent Rad51 accumulation at DNA damage sites did not reflect a general propensity to displace ssDNA-binding proteins. These data indicate that hFbh1 or an hFbh1-containing complex is capable of actively removing Rad51 from chromatin.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>hFbh1 acts as an anti-recombinase by displacing Rad51 from chromatin.</bold> (A) U2OS/GFP-hFbh1 WT cells were induced or not with DOX for 24 h and subjected to HU for 2 h or IR for 1 h.

To test this, we assessed Rad51 focus formation in primary BJ fibroblasts transfected with hFbh1 siRNAs. Using the nucleoside analogue EdU as a marker for replicating cells, we analyzed Rad51 focus formation in S phase and observed a significant, roughly threefold increase in the occurrence of spontaneous Rad51 foci in cells depleted for endogenous hFbh1 using two independent siRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 C</xref>). To directly test whether hFbh1 has anti-recombinase activity, we used an HR reporter assay in which HR is measured as the ability of cells to repair an I-SceI&#x02013;induced DSB in an inactive GFP construct that becomes functional only through HR-mediated repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Sartori et al., 2007</xref>). We observed a marked &#x0223c;40% decrease in HR events when hFbh1 was cotransfected with I-SceI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 D</xref>), which is comparable with the extent of HR suppression observed after siRNA-mediated depletion of Rad51 (not depicted). Collectively, these findings suggest that hFbh1 functions as a bonafide anti-recombination factor in human cells through its ability to dismantle the Rad51 nucleofilament and thus may help to prevent unscheduled HR during normal DNA replication and in response to DNA damage.</p></sec><sec><title>hFbh1 facilitates ssDNA generation at stalled replication forks</title><p>To further dissect the mechanism by which hFbh1 displaces Rad51 from chromatin, we introduced point mutations into hFbh1 to functionally impair its conserved F box (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref>, *FB) or helicase domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref>, *HL). We verified the effect of the F box mutations by demonstrating that they impaired hFbh1 binding to the Skp, Cullin, F Box&#x02013;containing complex core subunit Skp1, which is the known function of the F box (Fig. S1 C). Surprisingly, hFbh1 helicase domain was also unable to bind Skp1 (Fig. S1 C), which may suggest that hFbh1 only associates stably with Skp1 in a chromatin context (see following paragraph). In agreement with data from fission yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Sakaguchi et al., 2008</xref>), mutation of the F box resulted in pancellular distribution of GFP-hFbh1 (unpublished data), and thus, we tagged the GFP-hFbh1 constructs with N-terminal NLSs to be able to compare their functional properties. We generated stable cell lines expressing such NLS&#x02013;GFP-hFbh1 proteins and tested their ability to recruit to ssDNA regions induced by HU treatment. Although mutation of the F box partially impaired the binding of GFP-hFbh1 to RPA-coated ssDNA, disruption of the catalytic activity of its helicase domain completely prevented accumulation of GFP-hFbh1 on ssDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 B</xref>).</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p><bold>The helicase activity of hFbh1 facilitates ssDNA generation at replication blocks.</bold> (A) Schematic depiction of the hFbh1 protein, showing localization of conserved domains.

In case of the F box mutant, this can be explained, at least in part, by its residual capability to bind damaged DNA, which might be sufficient to displace Rad51 from ssDNA. Such a scenario also indicates that the potential ubiquitin ligase activity of hFbh1 (the function of which is unknown) may not be required per se for its anti-recombinogenic function. The impact of the helicase domain mutant on Rad51 focus formation appeared more complex, and to elucidate this issue, we set out to measure the production of ssDNA after replication stress. Interestingly, we observed that cells overexpressing GFP-hFbh1 helicase domains failed to produce detectable HU-induced ssDNA stretches, which is indicated by a quantitative loss of RPA foci and reduced BrdU immunostaining under native conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 B</xref>). We obtained similar results using biochemical isolation of chromatin-enriched fractions from NLS&#x02013;GFP-hFbh1&#x02013;inducible cells in which the helicase domain mutant but not the wild-type (WT) or F box alleles of GFP-hFbh1 suppressed the increased chromatin loading of RPA after HU treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 C</xref>). Induction of WT or mutant GFP-hFbh1 had little impact on cell cycle distribution (Fig. S1 D), ruling out cell cycle effects as a major cause of the observed phenotypes. Using EMSA, we found that the hFbh1 helicase domain mutant retained the capability to bind to ssDNA (Fig. S2 C) even though it was not stably recruited to ssDNA sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 B</xref>). Thus, it appears that by binding short stretches of ssDNA at stalled replication forks while being unable to unwind DNA, the hFbh1 helicase domain mutant may act as a dominant-negative factor to prevent further ssDNA production in response to replication blocks, likely blocking the access of active Fhh1 (and perhaps even other ssDNA-producing helicases) to DNA lesions. As has been found for other UvrD helicases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Maluf et al., 2003</xref>), hFbh1 formed homodimers (Fig. S2 D), potentially explaining the ability of the overexpressed helicase domain mutant to act in a dominant-negative fashion in the presence of endogenous hFbh1. Thus, the lack of Rad51 focus formation observed in HU-treated cells expressing GFP-Fbh1 helicase domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 B</xref>) likely reflects their inability to produce sufficiently long stretches of ssDNA required for Rad51 recruitment.</p><p>Collectively, these data suggest that in addition to its anti-recombinogenic effect, hFbh1 may also possess prorecombinase activity by facilitating ssDNA production after replication blocks to promote the loading of RPA, which is in turn required for proper checkpoint signaling and HR repair. Consistently, cells depleted for endogenous hFbh1 displayed markedly reduced ssDNA production in response to HU treatment, an effect that could be fully rescued by induction of siRNA-insensitive GFP-Fbh1 in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 D</xref>). Such a dual role of hFbh1 in terms of pro- and anti-recombination activities is analogous to that of BLM helicase, which functions in ssDNA production after DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Gravel et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Zhu et al., 2008</xref>) as well as displacement of Rad51 from ssDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bugreev et al., 2007</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>hFbh1 is a suppressor of SCE</title><p>A prominent feature of unrestricted HR is the hyper-recombination phenotype, a hallmark of BLM syndrome, which is characterized by an increase in the SCE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Branzei and Foiani, 2007</xref>). The similar functions of hFbh1 and BLM prompted us to explore whether hFbh1 also regulates SCE. Knockdown of hFbh1 in primary fibroblasts led to a small but significant increase in SCE compared with control cells (5.6 and 4.1 events/cell, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5, A and B</xref>), an effect augmented by exposure to camptothecin (34 vs. 22 events/cell, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 C</xref>). This is consistent with data in Fbh1-deficient chicken DT40 cells, which also exhibit increased SCE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Kohzaki et al., 2007</xref>), and further supports the notion that hFbh1 is a bonafide anti-recombinogenic factor required to restrain unscheduled HR, slight elevations of which may be sufficient to compromise genomic integrity. The existence of several helicases with anti-recombinogenic functions in human cells may account for a higher degree of redundancy in this system and could explain the relatively mild SCE phenotype observed in hFbh1 knockdown cells.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><p><bold>Depletion of hFbh1 increases SCE.</bold> (A) BJ cells were transfected with control or hFbh1 siRNAs for 48 h and subjected to SCE analysis.

In the first step, hFbh1 is recruited to genotoxic stress-induced ssDNA. By means of its helicase activity, hFbh1 may help to facilitate ssDNA production to the extent required for productive HR, and up to this stage, hFbh1 can function to promote HR initiation. However, in later stages, hFbh1 restrains excessive and/or unscheduled HR through its ability to displace Rad51 from ssDNA. Such a dual role in the multistep process of HR has also been proposed for the BLM helicase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bugreev et al., 2007</xref>). hFbh1 may increase the pool of cellular pro- and anti-recombinase activities and thus contributes to the maintenance of genomic integrity.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Plasmids and RNAi</title><p>A partial cDNA spanning amino acids 126&#x02013;1,094 of hFbh1 was provided by Y.-S.
