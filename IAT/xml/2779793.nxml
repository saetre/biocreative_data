Multiple environmental and genetic factors are known to predispose to essential hypertension, with genetic predisposition contributing to 30-60% of the pathoetiology of the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. We previously reported on families with an inherited disposition to essential hypertension; some families showed an obvious pattern of maternal inheritance indicative of a mitochondrial disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In a previous study on a large Chinese Han family with maternally-inherited hypertension we uncovered a mutation in the mitochondrial A4263G tRNA<sup>Ile </sup>gene. The mutation was found to affect a nucleotide conserved from bacteria to human. Importantly, the change was inferred to influence amino acid charging of tRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and was therefore likely to lead to translational amino-acid substitutions in some mitochondrial proteins, with major consequences for mitochondrial function.</p><p>Recent studies have reported that the outer mitochondrial membrane voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) is associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], an important finding in view of the link between diabetes and mitochondrial function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].

To study the link between the mitochondrial tRNA<sup>Ile </sup>A4263G mutation, high blood pressure, and apoptosis we established lymphoblastoid cell lines from individuals carrying the A4263G mutation and from controls.

Approximately 1 billion individuals worldwide and 130 million in China suffer from hypertension, and the rates of morbidity and mortality associated with essential hypertension (EHT) continue to rise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Epidemiological studies have indicated that the genetic variance underlying the predisposition to EHT ranges from 30-60% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations characterized by maternal inheritance may make a significant contribution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. The Framingham heart study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] on blood pressure in 6421 participants from 1593 families estimated that the heritability due to maternal effects was 5% for multivariable-adjusted long-term average systolic blood pressure, while the heritability of diastolic blood pressure due to maternal effects was 4%.</p><p>We previously reported on a large Chinese Han family with a predisposition to hypertension that demonstrated a typical maternal pattern of inheritance. mtDNA sequence analysis revealed a A4263G mutation in the mtDNA tRNA<sup>Ile </sup>gene that is extraordinarily conserved from bacteria to human. The voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) is a highly conserved protein located on the outer mitochondrial membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. VDAC, in association with ANT (adenine nucleotide translocator), mediates the transport of ATP and ADP both into and out of the mitochondrion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. VDAC closure inhibits the release of ATP from the mitochondrion and promotes the opening of K<sub>ATP </sub>channels in the plasma membrane. VDAC also mediates mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+ </sup>and may play a key role in intracellular Ca<sup>2+ </sup>signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. <italic>t</italic>Bid, a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl<sub>2 </sub>family, closes VDAC, and this may partly account for the inhibition of VDAC reported during apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. In contrast, anti-apoptotic Bcl-XL prevents VDAC closure, a finding consistent with the interpretation that VDAC opening is anti-apoptotic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. VDAC also appears to be an anchor point for pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins; it has been hypothesized that VDAC contributes to increase of mitochondrial permeability that is involved in the initiation of apoptosis.</p><p>We studied the effects of the mtDNA tRNA<sup>Ile </sup>A4263G mutation on VDAC function and apoptosis. We report that expression level of VDAC mRNA in cell lines carrying the mutation was significantly decreased. Although the exact mechanism is unknown, it may be associated with dysfunction of energy metabolism and consequent increase in the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. We hypothesis that high apoptosis of the mutated cell lines was associated with increased expression of VDAC mRNA, which could be inhibited by the CsA, a kind of inhibitor of VDAC. In addition, imaging revealed that VDAC was co-localized with Bax protein in cell lines carrying the 4263 A&#x02192;G mutation. These changes were accompanied by a decrease in the mitochondrial membrane potential &#x00394;&#x003a8;<sub>m </sub>and increased levels of apoptosis versus control cell lines. The role of VDAC in these processes was confirmed by application of the selective VDAC inhibitor Cyclosporin A (CsA): the inhibitor abolished co-localization with Bax, restored &#x00394;&#x003a8;<sub>m </sub>to levels of control CsA-treated cells, and decreased levels of apoptosis. Taken together, these results suggest that the mtDNA A4263G mutation, inferred to cause mis-charging of tRNA<sup>Ile </sup>and consequent amino acid substitutions in mitochondrial proteins, may exert its pro-hypertensive effects by deregulating the expression of VDAC, in turn leading to increases in programmed cell death.</p><p>So we conclude that increased expression of mitochondrial VDAC and subcellular co-localization of VDAC/Bax increases mitochondrial permeability and apoptosis in cell lines carrying the mtDNA tRNA<sup>Ile </sup>A4263G mutation.</p><p>Recent efforts to identify genes involved in essential hypertension (EHT) have focused on genetic markers and candidate genes in the nuclear genome. Nevertheless, the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying EHT remain unknown. Our results highlight the potential importance of mitochondrial genes in the etiology of hypertension. However, this work does not exclude a contribution from the nuclear genome, and maternal inheritance of a predisposition to EHT is likely to result from interactions between mtDNA and nuclear mutations. So further research will be required to elucidate the mechanisms whereby nuclear-mitochondrial interactions can predispose to the development of hypertension.</p><p>Finally this article we conclude that increased expression of mitochondrial VDAC and subcellular co-localization of VDAC/Bax increases mitochondrial permeability and apoptosis.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>Liu Yuqi, Gao Lei, Li Yang contributed equally to this article.
