Little is known about how recognition is achieved by DGR variable proteins. Here, we present the structure of the <italic>Bordetella</italic> bacteriophage DGR variable protein major tropism determinant (Mtd) bound to the receptor pertactin, revealing remarkable adaptability in the static binding sites of Mtd. Despite large dissimilarities in ligand binding mode, principles underlying selective recognition were strikingly conserved between Mtd and immunoreceptors. Central to this was the differential amplification of binding strengths by avidity (i.e., multivalency), which not only relaxed the demand for optimal complementarity between Mtd and pertactin but also enhanced distinctions among binding events to provide selectivity. A quantitatively similar balance between complementarity and avidity was observed for <italic>Bordetella</italic> bacteriophage DGR as occurs in the immune system, suggesting that variable repertoires operate under a narrow set of conditions to recognize novel ligands.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>The immune system long has been considered unique in its capacity to recognize alien molecules. This anticipatory recognition depends on a repertoire of receptors&#x02014;antibodies and T cell receptors&#x02014;with binding sites capable of accommodating trillions of different amino acid sequence combinations. A similar capacity was discovered recently in diversity-generating retroelements (DGRs), which are encoded by prokaryotes and the bacteriophages that infect them. The receptor-binding protein Mtd of <italic>Bordetella</italic> bacteriophage is encoded by a DGR and accommodates trillions of sequences in its binding site. DGR-programmed variation of Mtd allows the phage to use alternative host receptors&#x02014;an ability that is crucial for phage infection because the expression pattern of these host receptors changes according to the environmental status of the bacterium. We sought to understand how Mtd recognizes receptors by determining the structure of an Mtd variant bound to the host receptor pertactin. With this structural knowledge, we then compared the binding properties of different variants and their ability to support phage infection. Despite large differences in physical details between Mtd and immunoreceptors, general principles emerged through which variable repertoires achieve selective molecule recognition, providing a view of how the Mtd family can rapidly evolve novel specificities.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>Although the massively variable protein Mtd of the<italic>Bordetella</italic> bacteriophage diversity-generating retroelement recognizes ligands in a different manner from antigen receptors of the immune system, general principles underlying anticipatory recognition are strikingly conserved.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Miller JL, Le Coq J, Hodes A, Barbalat R, Miller JF, et al.

Amplification of the strength of individual binding events by avidity enables variants with suboptimal complementarity for their ligands to nevertheless achieve binding strengths required for biological effect. This results in an expansion in the number of productive interactions available to a variable repertoire (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060131-g008">Figure 8</xref>).</p><p>For every binding event that is amplified by avidity and made productive, like that of Mtd-P1 or Mtd-P6 with pertactin, there are many more that are just slightly weaker, like that of Mtd-M1 with pertactin, and still more that are even weaker, and so on (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060131-g008">Figure 8</xref>). Yet, what emerges from this pool of binding events with graded affinities is a highly selective response, with Mtd-P1 and Mtd-P6 supporting infectivity through pertactin but not Mtd-M1. The explanation for this lies in the differential gain of avidity.</p><p>Avidity amplifies the strength of individual binding events by the exponential factor &#x003b1;<italic>N</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060131-g008">Figure 8</xref>) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060131-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d;. The magnitude of &#x003b1;<italic>N</italic> depends on the details of receptor density and geometry, with &#x003b1; being the degree of cooperativity and <italic>N</italic> the valency of interaction. Significantly, &#x003b1;<italic>N</italic> was &#x0223c;2 for Mtd-P1 and Mtd-P6 as well as for Mtd-M1, meaning that neither the degree of cooperativity nor the valency differed between productive and nonproductive interactions. This is consistent with Mtd-P6 and Mtd-M1 having a common pertactin epitope. Selectivity in infection instead emerged from &#x003b1;<italic>N</italic>, which effectively squared the &#x0223c;10<sup>&#x02212;6</sup> M <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub>'s of Mtd-P1 and Mtd-P6 for pertactin into the picomolar range for the phage but the &#x0223c;0.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup> M <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> of Mtd-M1 only to the near micromolar range.

Thus, avidity not only amplified the strength of individual binding events but importantly also amplified the differences between such events. A &#x0223c;100-fold difference in the micromolar <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> range for Mtd (i.e., 3&#x02013;5 &#x003bc;M for Mtd-P1 and Mtd-P6 versus &#x0223c;500 &#x003bc;M for Mtd-M1) resulted in a &#x0223c;10<sup>5</sup>-fold difference in the picomolar <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> range for the phage (i.e., &#x0223c;6&#x02013;7 pM for BPP-1 and BPP-6 versus &#x0223c;0.5 &#x003bc;M for BMP-1). Steps subsequent to binding may further enhance the selectivity initially provided by the differential gain of avidity &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060131-b034">34</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>The essential role of avidity in the responsiveness and selectivity of the Mtd repertoire predicts multivalency to be a general feature of variable repertories, consistent with the prevalence of multivalency in the adaptive immune system. It is striking that both Mtd and the immune system have arrived at common solutions for achieving productive interactions. In each case, only moderate surface complementarities (SC &#x02248; 0.65) are required for productive interactions, as the micromolar <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub>'s of these binding events are amplified by avidity to high affinity ranges. This amplification relaxes the demand for optimal complementarity and as a consequence expands the scope of ligands capable of being recognized, thereby making the repertoire more responsive.</p><p>The amplification effect of avidity is powerful, and it is conceivable that interactions with even worse complementarities and affinities (e.g., millimolar <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub>) could be made productive by avidity. For this, the exponential factor &#x003b1;<italic>N</italic> would need to be large enough to compensate for these very low affinities. However, such potent amplification would also come at a cost, creating a repertoire that is overly responsive and therefore lacking selectivity and most likely effectiveness as well (due to tendencies toward self-aggregation). It appears that this is the reason that variable repertoires have evolved to have moderate values of &#x003b1;<italic>N</italic>. Interactions by immunoglobulin G's have been documented to be amplified by &#x003b1;<italic>N</italic> values of &#x0223c;1.2, and even immunoglobulin M's, which are potentially pentavalent, have been documented to be amplified by moderate &#x003b1;<italic>N</italic> values of &#x0223c;2.5 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060131-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d;. This is similar to our results, showing that potentially dodecavalent Mtd displayed by <italic>Bordetella</italic> phage is amplified by &#x003b1;<italic>N</italic> of only &#x0223c;2.</p><p>These observations suggest the existence of an optimal balance between surface complementarity and avidity in variable repertoires. Moderate values in each (SC &#x02248; 0.65 and &#x003b1;<italic>N</italic> &#x02248; 2) are seen to support responsiveness and selectivity in recognition by the <italic>Bordetella</italic> bacteriophage DGR and the immune system. In comparison, an imbalance towards low &#x003b1;<italic>N</italic> and consequent demand for high SC would lead to sparse recognition (i.e., nonresponsiveness), and an imbalance towards high &#x003b1;<italic>N</italic> and resulting tolerance of low SC would lead to promiscuous binding (i.e., nonselectivity). Despite depending on dramatically different modes of ligand recognition, the <italic>Bordetella</italic> bacteriophage DGR and the immune system have evolved quantitatively similar principles for selective ligand recognition. These similarities suggest that a narrow set of conditions endow variable repertoires with responsiveness and selectivity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Phage evolution.</title><p>BMP-1(&#x00394;<italic>brt</italic>) lysogens were induced, as previously described &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060131-b004">4</xref>&#x0005d;, from <named-content content-type="genus-species">B. bronchiseptica</named-content> RB50 expressing <italic>Brt</italic> ectopically from the <named-content content-type="genus-species">B. bronchiseptica</named-content> filamentous hemagglutinin promoter on the pBBR1MCS-derived, medium-copy plasmid pMin1 (M.
