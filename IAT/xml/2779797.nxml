In addition to the loss of tumor suppression function and exertion of dominant-negative effects over the remaining wild-type protein, several p53 mutants can gain novel oncogenic functions (gain-of-function, GOF) that actively regulate cancer development and progression. In human endometrial cancer, p53 mutation is more often associated with aggressive nonendometrioid cancer. However, it was unknown if p53 mutants contributed to endometrial cancer progression through the GOF properties.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>To clarify the relationship between expression of p53 GOF mutation (p53-R175H) and invasive potential of human endometrial cancer KLE cells, we tested the consequences of up-regulation and down-regulation of p53-R175H in KLE cells by inducing p53-R175H expression vector or suppressing the p53 gene with short hairpin RNA.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We found that forced over-expression of p53-R175H significantly promoted cell migration and invasion, and induced activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway.

Asian nations such as China and Japan have an incidence that is 4-5 times lower than in Western nations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. However, the incidence of EC in Asian countries has markedly increased in recent years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Patients with advanced-stage EC frequently exhibit a poor prognosis, even after radical resection combined with radiotherapy or chemotherapy. These poor outcomes are closely associated with the progression and metastasis of the disease. Thus, a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the aggressive behavior of EC is necessary to identify potential targets for efficient therapy.</p><p>The tumor suppressor gene <italic>TP53 </italic>regulates the expression of genes involved in cell cycle arrest, apoptosis and DNA damage repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. <italic>TP53 </italic>is mutated in more than half of human tumors. These mutations lead to single amino acid changes that influence the sequence-specific binding or the conformation of the mutant protein, abrogating its ability to induce the transcription of target genes (loss of function). It has been shown that p53 mutants exert dominant negative effects on co-expressed wild-type p53 (dominant-negative effects) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Previous studies also indicated certain p53 mutations may confer oncogenic properties (gain-of-function, GOF) beyond their negative transdomination over the wild-type p53 tumor suppressor functions. These GOF effects include enhanced cancer cell proliferation and increased tumorigenicity <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], suggesting that GOF activity of p53 mutation may play an important role in tumor progression. However, little is known about GOF effects on tumor cell invasive activity. A common p53 mutant p53-R175H has been previously shown to possess a marked anti-apoptotic GOF in lung cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In human EC, p53 mutations are more frequently identified in aggressive nonendometrioid cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. However, the precise role and the molecular mechanism of GOF properties of p53 mutants in EC progression and metastasis are poorly understood.</p><p>In this report, we sought to investigate the consequences of up-regulation and down-regulation of GOF p53 mutant (p53-R175H) on EC cell migration and invasion. Furthermore, we examined the molecular mechanisms by which p53-R175H over-expression lead to invasive phenotype in EC. We showed, for the first time, that elevated expression of p53-R175H in EC cells can display GOF effects to promote the invasive potential by activation of the EGFR/PI3K/AKT pathway.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Cell lines and cell culture</title><p>The EC cell line KLE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] harboring a p53 missense at codon 175 (p53-R175H, CGC &#x0003e; CAC) was obtained from the Cell Bank of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai (China) and grown in Ham's F12 medium containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum.

The corresponding empty vector named pCMV was made from pCMV-p53 by removing p53 sequence and religating the vector. pCMV-p53mt175 expression vector, which contains mutant p53-R175H, was generated from pCMV-p53 by the QuickChange mutagenesis system (Stratagene) following the manufacturer's recommendations. The primer sequence used for mutagenesis is 5'-GTGAGGCACTGCCCCCAC (forward) and 5'-GTGGGGGCAGTGCCTCAC-3' (reverse). The sequences of the mutation constructs were verified with an ABI 3100 sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Stable transfection of pCMV-p53mt175 and pCMV vector was performed using Lipofectamine PLUS Reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The transfected cells were selected in medium containing G418 (200 mg/ml). Independent clones were isolated, expanded, and screened for the expression of p53 protein expression by Western blotting. KLE cells transfected with pCMV-p53mt175 were designated R175H cells, and KLE cells transfected with pCMV vector were designated Vector cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Knockdown of p53 GOF mutation p53-R175H using short hairpin RNA</title><p>The pSUPER-p53 RNAi System [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] was used to generate a stable KLE cell line with knocked-down p53 gene by an RNAi approach as described earlier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].

We transfected this cell line with either pCMV-p53mt175 or empty pCMV vector. The degree of p53-R175H protein expression was documented on Western blotting.

It has been shown that activated EGFR strongly correlate with tumor invasion and metastasis in EC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Previous studies using osteosarcoma cells showed an association between EGFR and p53 mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. EGFR activation can lead to the activation of the downstream PI3K/AKT pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the effect of p53-R175H expression on EGFR/PI3K/AKT signal pathway using Western blotting after up-regulation or down-regulation of p53-R175H in KLE cells, respectively. When comparing with UT cells or Vector cells, R175H cells showed marked increase in constitutive activation of EGFR (p-EGFR, Tyr<sup>1173</sup>) and AKT (pAKT, Ser<sup>473</sup>) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). Conversely, the down-regulation of p53-R175H expression by RNAi resulted in inactivation of EGFR and AKT (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). Because EGFR activation also results in the activation of the downstream MEK/ERK pathways, we next investigated the effect of p53-R175H expression on these pathways. Western blot analysis showed that no significant change in the levels of pERK1/2 was observed in R175H or Vector cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). These findings suggest that p53-R175H-induced cell invasion and migration in KLE cells is dependent of EGFR/PI3K/AKT, but not EGFR/MEK/ERK signaling pathway.</p><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>p53-R175H induces activation of EGFR/PI3K/AKT pathway</bold>.

For example, p53 mutants can enhanced tumorigenic potential in nude mice and enhanced plating efficiency in agar cell culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. These gain-of-functions of p53 cancer mutants acquire novel oncogenic activities, which may account for the close correlation between the expression of p53 mutants and the poor prognosis of patients with EC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Moreover, p53 mutations are frequently detected in patients with high-grade serous and clear cell carcinomas, which are associated with an aggressive clinical course [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], suggesting the possibility that p53 mutations mediate features of the invasive and metastatic behavior of EC cells. However, little information is available regarding the consequence of GOF p53 mutant expression in EC progression. Therefore, in this study, we investigated the possible GOF roles of mutant p53 protein R175H in cell invasion and migration in EC KLE cells. Our data suggested that up-regulation of p53-R175H dramatically enhanced cell invasion and migration in KLE cells as shown in cell invasion and migration assay (Figure. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Conversely, down-regulation of p53-R175H by siRNA significantly attenuated the invasive potential of KLE cells (Figure. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Previous study showed p53-R175H can endow p53-negative T-ALL cells with the capacity to disseminate, and induce lymphohematopoietic metastatic potential and tissue invasiveness in SCID mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Thus, our results provided the in vitro evidence in support of the role of GOF activities of certain p53 mutant as an oncogene in EC progression.</p><p>Ample evidences support the critical role EGFR in tumor growth and progression, including angiogenesis, tumor cell proliferation and metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. EGFR expression is increased in various cancer types, including endometrial cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. High levels of EGFR protein expression strongly correlates with tumor metastasis and poor prognosis in EC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Previous study showed an association between p53 mutation and EGFR in bladder cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Mutant p53-R175H has also been shown to activate the EGFR promoter in human osteosarcoma Saos-2 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. EGFR activation triggers the downstream PI3K/AKT and MEK/ERK signaling pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Therefore, in this study, we determined the possible mechanisms by which p53-R175H could promote invasion ability in EC cells in regulation of EGFR/PI3K/AKT and EGFR/MEK/ERK pathway. Our present data suggested that over-expression of p53-R175H led to enhanced EGFR phosphorylation, and subsequently activation of PI3K/AKT pathway, but had no effect on the MEK/ERK pathway in KLE cells (Figure. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). These results were supported by earlier reports that over-expression of EGFR in prostate and ovarian cancer was associated with activation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Moreover, treatment of EGFR inhibitor abolished p53-R175H-induced cell invasion and migration and attenuated activation of AKT (Figure. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>), suggesting GOF effects of this mutant could drive invasive characteristics in EC cells through EGFR/PI3K/AKT-dependent pathway. However, our study is still limited for utilizing the cell line that expresses p53-R175H. Further experiments using p53-null EC cell lines are needed to confirm whether or not this mutation can show GOF properties to activate the EGFR/PI3K/AKT pathway, subsequently to enhance EC metastasis.</p><p>Overall, the results of this study show the possibility that GOF activity of p53-R175H contributes to an aggressive phenotype to EC cells, at least in part through the ability of p53-R175H to associate with active EGFR, subsequently resulting in the activation of its downstream PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>Dong PX designed research; Dong PX, Xu ZJ and Jia N carried out the molecular genetic studies; Dong PX, Li DJ and Feng YJ analyzed data; Dong PX wrote the paper.
