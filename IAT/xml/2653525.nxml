Recently, B19-VP1u has been reported to have the phospholipase A2 (PLA2) motif and secreted phospholipases A2 (sPLA2) activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], and is associated with various autoimmune diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>The infection of B19 has been postulated to the generation of various autoantibodies including anti-nuclear antibody (ANA), anticardiolipin antibody (aCL), and anti-phospholipid antibody (APhL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], as well as the anti-phospholipid syndrome (APS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Notably, a significant similarity existed in the specificity of APhL between patients with B19 infection or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) was reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Recent studies have suggested that B19 may exacerbate or even induce SLE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Our recent findings indicated that serum from patients with acute B19 infection have a high frequency in recognition of cardiolipin (CL) and &#x003b2;2GPI, and the phospholipase domain observed in the B19-VP1u may contribute to the generation of APhL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Additionally, the BALB/c mice immunized with anti-B19-VP1u IgG developed thrombocytopenia, prolongation of aPTT, and autoantibody against &#x003b2;2GPI and PhL and suggested the association among anti-B19-VP1u IgG and production of anti-&#x003b2;2GPI antibodies, APhL, and APS-like autoimmunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>However, no further study was performed in elucidating the effect of anti-B19-VP1u antibody on disease activity in SLE. In current study, we treated NZB/W F1 mice with passive transfer of rabbit anti-B19-VP1u antibody to investigate the effect of elicited anti-B19-VP1u antibody on diseases activity in SLE.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Preparation of recombinant human B19-VP1 unique region protein and rabbit anti-B19-VP1 unique region antibody</title><p>Construction of B19-VP1u cDNA into pET-32a expression vector (Novagene, Cambridge, MA) was performed and the recombinant B19-VP1u protein was purified as described in our recent publication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. For generation of antisera against the B19-VP1u, four female New Zealand White rabbits were immunized subcutaneous in the neck region with 0.5 mg of purified recombinant B19-VP1u protein in Freund's complete adjuvant (Sigma, Saint Louis Mo, USA) followed by injection at two-week intervals with 0.25 mg of B19-VP1uproteininFreund'sincompleteadjuvant (Sigma, Saint Louis Mo, USA). A control group were immunized with Freund's complete adjuvant and followed by injection with Freund's incomplete adjuvant.

Induction of experimental APS by passive transfer was performed according to the method of Blank [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Disease activity of mice was determined by monitoring the proteinuria biweekly with Albustix test strips from the age of 14 weeks for ten weeks as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. All rabbit IgG were isolated using Protein A beads as described in our recent report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The dosage of anti-B19-VP1u IgG is based on a previous study of inducing APS in mice with anti-cardiolopin antibodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Proportionally, the common used concentration of immunoglobulins-preparations in mice is 20 ug/dosage and the titer of 20 ug rabbit anti-B19-VP1u IgG is similar to 27 U after determination and mathematics conversion (IBL-America, MN, USA) while the values of other control IgG preparations are less than 7 U. The titer greater than 12 U is considered as positive. The mice at age of 20 weeks were divided into four groups and were intravenously received rabbit anti-B19-VP1u IgG (20 ug), normal rabbit IgG (20 ug), rabbit anti-B19-NS1 IgG (20 ug), and PBS through the tail vein, respectively. The mice were then sacrificed on day 30 by CO<sub>2 </sub>asphyxiation and the heart blood samples were collected. APS clinical parameters, including thrombocytomenia and prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time [aPTT], were evaluated and the platelet counts were detected using Systemex (KX-21, KOBE, Japan). The presence of lupus anticoagulants were evaluated by the prolongation of aPTT in a mixing tests by adding 1 volume of plasma from whole blood mixed with sodium citrate 0.123 mol/l in a 9:1 ratio to 1 volume of each cephalin and incubating for 2 minutes at 37&#x000b0;C. Another volume of 0.025 M CaCl2 (Sigma, Saint Louis Mo, USA) was added, and the clotting time was recorded in seconds using Coatron M1 (TECO GmbH, Neufahrn NB, Germany).</p></sec><sec><title>ELISA</title><p>Direct antigen-specific ELISA kits were used to detect APhL IgG (Louisville APL Diagnostics, Inc.

The color reaction was performed as described above. For detecting the binding activity of anti-B19-VP1u antibody, recombinant B19-VP1u was coated in a 96 well plate and ELISA was performed as described in our recent report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The cutoff value for each ELISA experiment was obtained (mean+3SD) and the absorbance above the value is regarded as positive.</p></sec><sec><title>Preparation of tissue extract and determination of protein</title><p>All procedures were performed at 4&#x000b0;C. Liver samples obtained from NZB/W F1 mice were homogenized in 600 ul PRO-PREP&#x02122; solution (iNtRON Biotech, Korea) by 30 strokes using a Dounce Homogenizer (Knotes Glass, Vineland, NJ). The homogenates were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 minutes at 4&#x000b0;C and the supernatant was stored at -80&#x000b0;C until use. Protein concentration of tissue extracts was determined according to the method described by Bradford [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] using bovine serum albumin as standards.</p></sec><sec><title>Gel zymography</title><p>MMP-2 and MMP-9 activities were analyzed by gelatin-zymography assays as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Ten microliters of ten-fold diluted serum or 25 &#x003bc;g protein lysates of liver tissue from NZB/W F1 mice with passive transfer anti-idiotype antibodies were separated by an 8% Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) gels containing 0.1% gelatin. Gels were washed for 30 min in 2.5% Triton X-100 to remove the SDS and then soaked in the reaction buffer containing 40 mM Tris-HCl, pH8.0, 10 mM CaCl<sub>2 </sub>and 0.02% NaN3 for 30 min. The reaction buffer was changed to a fresh one, and the gels were incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for 24 h. Gelatinolytic activity was visualized by staining the gels with 0.5% Coomassie brillant blue R-250, destained with methanol-acetic acid water, and relative MMP levels were quantitated by a gel documentation and analysis system (Appraise, Beckman-Coulter, Brea, California, USA).</p></sec><sec><title>Western blot</title><p>The loading sample for each lane of Western blot was a pool of four random selected mice of the same group.

After blocking with 5% non-fat dry milk in (PBS), antibodies against MMP2, MMP9, phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate kinase (PI3K) and phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (p-ERK1/2), and actin (Upstates, Charlottesville, Virginia, USA) were diluted in PBS with 2.5% BSA and incubated for 1.5 hr with gentle agitation at room temperature. The membranes were then incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated secondary antibody. Pierce's Supersignal West Dura HRP Detection Kit (Pierce Biotechnology Inc., Rockford, IL) was used to detect the antigen-antibody complexes.

APS is characterized by raised titers of circulating APhL that bind target molecules primarily via &#x003b2;2GPI, and/or lupus anticoagulant in association with recurrent fetal loss, thromboembolic phenomena, thrombocytopenia, CNS, heart, and other organ involvement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. &#x003b2;2GPI shares a common amino acid sequence with various microbial pathogens, and may be the cause of APS or production of the cross reacting autoantibodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Our previous study identified four cases of B19 infection associated with the production of aCL and anti-&#x003b2;2GPI antibodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Consistently, our recent study has demonstrated a spectrum of experimental APS-like autoimmunity induced by passive transfer of purified rabbit anti-B19-VP1u IgG antibodies and provided a connection between anti-B19-VP1u IgG and pathogenesis of SLE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In current study, we indicated the significant increases of APS-like syndromes including increased platelet count, prolonged PTT, and increased binding activity of APhL and dsDNA in NZB/W F1 mice that were received purified anti-B19-VP1u IgG. These findings strikingly suggested the aggravated effect of anti-B19-VP1u IgG in SLE.</p><p>Numerous studies have suggested that B19-VP1u plays a crucial role in induction of anti-&#x003b2;2GPI and APhL antibodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Adsorption experiment revealed the partially reduced reactivity of anti-B19-VP1u antibody to CL and &#x003b2;2GPI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], suggesting similar epitopes or conformation may exist between B19-VP1u, CL and &#x003b2;2GPI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. These experimental results may also account for the cross-reactivity of anti-B19-VP1u antibody against CL, &#x003b2;2GPI, and ph ospholipid and suggest underlying mechanisms in development of APS-like syndrome such as APhL antibody. In current study, significant increase of APhL antibodies was observed in NZB/W F1 mice that were received purified rabbit anti-B19-VP1u IgG, as compared to those mice that were received control rabbit IgG, rabbit anti-B19-NS1 IgG or PBS, respectively. This finding may be due to the similar epitopes and anti-idiotype networks among anti-B19-VP1u IgG, and APhL antibody. However, the underlying mechanism is still unclear and deed merited further investigations.</p><p>Previous studies have postulated MMPs to the pathogenesis of SLE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Cleavage of myelin basic protein or type II gelatins by MMP-9 will produce remnant epitopes and contribute to the development of autoimmunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. In recent studies, elevated MMP-9 activity was founded in both human and mice model with SLE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] and recognized to play crucial roles in development of SLE. Additionally, various studies have indicated the involvement of ERK and PI3K in activation of MMP-9. In monocytes from patients with rheumatoid arthritis, inhibition of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) abolished Cyclosporine A-induced MMP-9 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Another study reported that PI3K/Akt activation promotes transcriptional co-factor p300 recruitment and activation and led to increased proMMP-9 expression in rat astrocyte [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. In current study, significant increases of MMP-9 activity and protein expression were detected in NZB/W F1 mice that were received anti-B19-VP1u IgG, as well as the increased PI3K and phosphorylated ERK proteins. These data suggest the aggravated effect of anti-B19-VP1u IgG in pathogenesis of SLE and the involvement of activation of MMP-9 via PI3K and ERK signaling pathway. It could provide clues in treatment of SLE by inhibiting PI3K and EKR signaling pathway.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Taken together, our experimental results firstly demonstrated the aggravated APS-like syndromes in NZB/W F1 mice that were received anti-B19-VP1u IgG. Additionally, it could provide clues in understanding the roles of anti-B19-VP1u IgG in SLE and suggest possible therapeutic potential by inhibiting PI3K or AKT signaling pathway.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>CCT performed the animal study, ELISA, zymography, and Western blotting.
