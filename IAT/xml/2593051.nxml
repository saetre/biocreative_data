Strains deficient in either or both genes were constructed. Comparison of rhodanese activity in these strains revealed that PspE provides 85% of total rhodanese activity, with GlpE contributing most of the remainder. PspE activity was four times higher during growth on glycerol versus glucose, and was not induced by conditions that induce expression of the <italic>psp</italic> regulon. The <italic>glpE/pspE</italic> mutants displayed no apparent growth phenotypes, indicating that neither gene is required for biosynthesis of essential sulfur-containing molecules. PspE was purified by using cation exchange chromatography. Two distinct active peaks were eluted and differed in the degree of stable covalent modification, as assessed by mass spectrometry. The peak eluting earliest contained the equivalent mass of two additional sulfur atoms, whereas the second peak contained mainly one additional sulfur.

Catalysis occurs via a ping-pong mechanism, with an active site cysteine residue of the enzyme carrying the transferred sulfur as a covalent intermediate (a cysteine persulfide). In the absence of cyanide, the covalently bound sulfur may be transferred to other thiophilic acceptors, such as thiols. When a dithiol is the acceptor substrate, sulfide and the oxidized disulfide are the products of the reaction. Bovine rhodanese was discovered first, and a variety of enzymological and structural studies have been performed on that and other similar enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>]. The enzyme is comprised of two domains (~120 amino acids each) of similar structure that have limited amino acid sequence similarity to one another. The active site cysteine is only present within the carboxy-terminal rhodanese domain. Depending on the nature of the amino acids present in the active site loop, the tandem domain enzymes are classified as thiosulfate:cyanide sulfurtransferases, or as mercpatopyruvate sulfurtransferases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>].</p><p>Although rhodanese was discovered more than 70 years ago, physiological functions of various rhodaneses are just now being elucidated. Since the enzyme uses thiosulfate to convert toxic cyanide to the less toxic thiocyanate plus sulfite, it has been proposed that rhodaneses participate in cyanide detoxification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R7">7</xref>]. It is likely, however, that proteins containing a rhodanese domain play a variety of roles in trafficking of sulfur (and selenium) during synthesis of other cellular metabolites. Genome sequence information reveals that almost all organisms encode multiple rhodaneses, some of which are tandem-domain rhodaneses. Other proteins consist of only a single rhodanese domain, and are fully capable of catalysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. Finally, the rhodanese domain is predicted to be fused to a variety of other proteins. Knowledge of the functions of fusion partners, as well as of the genomic context of rhodanese-encoding genes in bacterial genomes has revealed the functions of some of the rhodanese domains. For example, the ThiI protein of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (needed for thiamin biosynthesis and for insertion of sulfur into uridine of certain tRNAs) contains a C-terminal rhodanese fusion, which was found to be essential for incorporation of the sulfur atom into 4-thiouridine of tRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>]. Another rhodanese fusion, human MOCS3, contains a C-terminal rhodanese domain that participates in sulfur transfer during molybdopterin biosynthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R13">13</xref>]. Bacterial MoeB/ThiF proteins correspond to human MOCS3 and are found with or without a C-terminal rhodanese domain, depending on the organism and metabolic system. It is possible that a rhodanese is generally needed for biosynthesis of molybdopterin and certain other sulfur-containing molecules. MoeB/ThiF proteins lacking the rhodanese domain may require a stand-alone rhodanese protein to provide sulfur transfer function.</p><p>Knowledge of the genomic context can often provide clues regarding function. YbbB of E. coli contains an N-terminal rhodanese domain and a C-terminal domain with an ATP-binding motif. In some organisms, ybbB is present within the selD operon. selD encodes selenophosphate synthetase, suggesting that ybbB might also be involved in selenium metabolism. It was found that the rhodanese domain of YbbB is necessary for incorporation of selenium into tRNA. YbbB catalyzes the conversion of 2-thiouridine to 2-selenouridine at the wobble position of certain tRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R14">14</xref>]. There are other examples where a rhodanese gene is found within an operon or cluster of genes known to be involved in sulfur metabolism. For example, the pathways for biosyntheses of pyridine-2,6-bis(thiocarboxylate) in Pseudomonas stutzeri and thioquinolobactin in P. fluorescens are dependent on enzymes similar to those involved in molybdopterin biosynthesis, and the gene clusters encoding these enzymes also encode a rhodanese [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R16">16</xref>]. Therefore, it is likely that these rhodaneses participate in sulfur transfer in a manner analogous to the rhodanese domain fused to the C-terminus of human MOCS3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>].</p><p>In addition to thiI and ybbB, the genome of E. coli contains seven other genes that are predicted to encode proteins with one or more rhodanese domains. Four of them (yceA, ygaP, yibN and ynjE), or their corresponding proteins, have not been studied. The other three proteins (GlpE, PspE and SseA) have known enzymatic functions and have been characterized in some detail [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>], but their physiological functions are not known. GlpE and PspE are single-domain rhodaneses, and SseA is a tandem-domain mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase. GlpE is encoded by the first gene in the complex glpEGR operon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>], which also encodes a rhomboid protein (GlpG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>]) and the repressor (GlpR) for the glycerol 3-phosphate regulon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>]. This genomic context suggests that a rhodanese might participate in the regulatory functions exerted by GlpG or GlpR, but it was found that the complex glpEGR operon is not subject to regulation by the glpR-encoded repressor, placing in doubt the possibility that GlpE plays a role in the utilization of glycerol 3-phosphate. PspE, a periplasmic protein, is reported to be a member of the pspABCDE (phage shock protein) operon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>]. Yet it is not clear what role a periplasmic sulfurtransferase might play in the cellular stress response to filamentous phage infection or other stresses, such as high salt, heat shock, or organic solvents, which are also known to induce this operon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R25">25</xref>].</p><p>In the work reported here, genetic and biochemical approaches were used to show that glpE is apparently dispensable for function of the glycerol 3-phosphate regulon. In addition, neither glpE nor pspE are essential for production of sulfur-containing cofactors or amino acids. Finally, the pspE gene does not appear to be coregulated with other members of the phage shock operon, but is regulated by the nature of the carbon source present in the growth medium.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|method"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODOLOGY</title><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title><p>Unless specified otherwise, the reagents used were of highest quality feasible, generally obtained from New England Biolabs, Sigma-Aldrich or Fisher Scientific.</p></sec><sec><title>Bacterial Strains</title><p>The bacterial strains used or constructed are described in Table <bold><xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref></bold>.

Growth was followed by monitoring optical density for 24 h. To test the ability of sulfurtransferase mutants to synthesize molybdopterin, mutants were cultured anaerobically on LB containing 20 mM sodium chlorate. Molybdopterin-deficient strains are chlorate resistant, since they are unable to assemble active nitrate reductase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>]. Nitrate reductase is capable of converting chlorate to chlorite, which is toxic.

In each case, the majority of the gene was ultimately replaced by the FRT scar. All insertion and deletion alleles were verified by PCR, and were mapped to the expected chromosomal locations by using phage P1-mediated cotransduction with an independent neighboring allele.</p><p>Growth phenotypes of the three mutant strains were compared with the wild type using rich and minimal media. All four strains were capable of growth on glucose, glycerol or acetate minimal media without supplementation. Growth on minimal medium indicated that neither glpE nor pspE is required for production of sulfur containing amino acids (cysteine and methionine) or cofactors (thiamin, biotin, lipoate). To find out if either gene is required for molybdopterin biosynthesis, the strains were plated on rich medium containing chlorate and incubated under anaerobic conditions. Under these conditions, strains unable to produce molybdopterin display a chlorate-resistant phenotype, since they are unable to produce active nitrate reductase (nitrate reductase converts chlorate to chlorite, which is toxic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R28">28</xref>]). All four strains displayed equal sensitivity toward chlorate, indicating that pspE and glpE are not essential for production of molybdopterin.</p><p>The periplasmic location of PspE suggested that it might serve as a detoxification enzyme for cyanide or for heavy metal cations such as cadmium. However, the pspE mutant HC7.1 was not more sensitive to KCN (0-1 mM) when compared to the wild type during growth on LB. Addition of 1 mM thiosulfate had no influence on the shapes of the growth curves. The results suggest that PspE does not play a role in cyanide detoxification, and are in agreement with those of Adams et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>], who reported that overexpression of PspE did not confer resistance to cyanide.</p><p>The periplasmic Dsb (disulfide bond formation) proteins, DsbA and DsbB, are involved in Hg<sup>2+</sup> and Cd<sup>2+</sup> detoxification by an unknown mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R45">45</xref>]. Although the Dsb proteins generally function to maintain disulfide bonds in periplasmic proteins, the possibility that the flow of electron could be from periplasmic dithiol protein, through the Dsb system to the persulfide form of periplasmic PspE was considered. Reduction of the cysteine persulfide would result in formation of hydrogen sulfide, which would precipitate (thereby detoxifying) heavy metal cations at the cell surface. If this were the case, mutation of pspE would be predicted to increase the sensitivity of E. coli to Hg2+ and Cd2+. Growth of wild-type and mutant strains deficient in pspE was compared on solid LB agar containing various concentrations of CdSO4 (0.01, 0.03, 0.1, 0.3 and 1.0 mM). Except for medium containing 1 mM Cd2+, all strains grew in the presence of Cd<sup>2+</sup>. No significant difference between the sulfurtransferase-deficient strains and the wild-type strain was observed.</p><p>A variety of other phenotypic tests were performed in which growth of the rhodanese-deficient strains was compared to that of the wild type. These included sensitivity to oxidative stress (peroxide, methyl viologen, selenite), antibiotics (tetracycline, chloramphenicol, spectinomycin, ampicillin, streptomycin, kanamycin, nalidixic acid), and detergent (deoxycholate). The ability to utilize a variety of compounds (sulfate, thiosulfate, taurine, cysteine) as sole sulfur source at relatively low concentration (0.05 &#x02013; 0.1 mM) was also investigated. In all cases, growth of the mutant strains was comparable to that of the wild-type strain.</p></sec><sec><title>Rhodanese Activities in Wild-Type and <italic>pspE/glpE</italic> Mutant Strains</title><p>In order to determine the contributions of PspE and GlpE to total rhodanese activity in E. coli, activities in cell-free extracts of the wild-type and the single and double mutant strains were determined following growth in glucose minimal medium. The results indicate that the pspE gene is responsible for contributing most of the rhodanese activity (Table <bold><xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref></bold>).</p><p>In various experiments, it was found that deletion of pspE decreased total rhodanese activity by 80 &#x02013; 90 %, whereas deletion of glpE resulted in a decrease of about 10 %. Only 5% of total rhodanese activity remained upon deletion of both genes. Residual activity could be due to the presence of one or more of the other proteins harboring a rhodanese domain.</p></sec><sec><title>Regulation of <italic>pspE</italic> and <italic>glpE</italic> Expression</title><p>Clues regarding function of the sulfurtransferases of <italic>E. coli</italic> were sought by investigating global gene expression data available in ASAP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R46">46</xref>]. These data indicated that <italic>pspE</italic> mRNA levels were expressed at higher levels during growth on glycerol, acetate or proline as carbon source relative to expression during growth on glucose. The expression of <italic>glpE</italic> was about the same regardless of carbon source. To determine if the apparent increased content of <italic>pspE</italic> mRNA during growth on glycerol minimal medium is reflected in an increase in rhodanese activity, an overnight culture of strain JLD17204 (<italic>&#x00394;glpE</italic>) was diluted into fresh minimal medium containing either glycerol or glucose as carbon source. At timed intervals, aliquots were withdrawn for measurement of optical density and rhodanese activity. Rhodanese activity was induced four to five fold during exponential growth on glycerol relative to the level of activity found in cells growing on glucose (Fig. <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref></bold>).</p><p>Induction of rhodanese activity was due to an increase in <italic>pspE</italic> expression, since the phenomenon did not occur in the strains in which <italic>pspE</italic> was deleted (Fig. <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref></bold>).</p><p>The <italic>pspE</italic> gene is part of the <italic>pspABCDE</italic> operon, but apparently is also transcribed independently from the other genes of the operon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>]. The rhodanese activity of PspE provides a facile reporter for expression of the operon. To determine if <italic>pspE</italic> is induced in response to the stressors that induce other members of the <italic>psp</italic> operon, rhodanese specific activity was determined in cultures of strain JLD17204 (<italic>&#x00394;glpE</italic>) growing in glucose minimal medium following various treatments (salt stress using 0.75 M NaCl or heat stress at 50 <sup>o</sup>C for 10 min). No increase in rhodanese activity was apparent in aliquots taken at 20, 40, 60 and 135 min following addition of NaCl (relative to unstressed cells). Small (10% and 40%) increases in rhodanese activity were observed 20 and 40 min following heat stress, but then activity declined. These observations indicate that <italic>pspE</italic> is not significantly co-regulated with the other members of the <italic>pspABCD</italic> operon, whose expression increases much more dramatically following stress. Data available in ASAP suggest that <italic>pspABCD</italic> operon mRNA levels increase from 5 to 10 fold following heat stress, while <italic>pspE</italic> mRNA levels increase only 1.5 fold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R47">47</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Purification and Characterization of PspE</title><p>PspE was previously purified as a cytoplasmically expressed protein possessing an N-terminal His-6 affinity tag [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. Native PspE is synthesized as a precursor with a 19 amino acid N-terminal signal sequence and is secreted to the periplasm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R48">48</xref>]. Mature PspE, comprised of only 85 amino acids, is the smallest known active rhodanese. In the present work, native PspE was overexpressed and purified as described in the &#x0201c;Methods.&#x0201d; Strong overexpression and its periplasmic location facilitated purification of PspE by freeze-thaw treatment, followed by cation exchange chromatography. A four-fold purification yielded approximately 5 mg of PspE from a 750-ml culture. Using Coomassie blue staining following SDS-PAGE, PspE was estimated to be &#x0003e;95% pure (Fig. <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref></bold>), and had a specific activity of 130 &#x02013; 150 U per mg of protein.</p><p>Elution of PspE from the cation exchange column using a salt gradient yielded two narrowly-separated but distinct peaks. The two peaks (PspE1 and PspE2) were collected separately and characterized. PspE1 had a more compact and/or more negatively charged form as analyzed by nondenaturing PAGE (Fig. <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref></bold>) and by gel chromatography (not shown). Treatment of PspE2 with 1 mM ammonium thiosulfate resulted in its conversion to the faster migrating form observed in fraction PspE1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>), suggesting that transfer of sulfur from thiosulfate to the active site cysteine of PspE2 results in its conversion to PspE1.</p><p>There is only one cysteine residue in PspE. Evidence for covalent modification of the active site cysteine of PspE was obtained by using several methods. First, it was found that PspE1 contained approximately one equivalent of cyanolyzable sulfur, with much less sulfur present in PspE2 (Fig. <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref></bold>). Second, PspE1 was much more tolerant to chemical inactivation by the cysteine-modifying reagent 5,5&#x02019;-dithio-bis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) compared with PspE2 (data not shown). It is known that the sulfur-free form of bovine rhodanese is twice as reactive toward DTNB relative to the cysteine persulfide form of the enzyme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R49">49</xref>], and the same appears to be the case for PspE.</p><p>Finally, analysis of the two fractions by electrospray mass spectrometry revealed that multiple, covalently modified forms of the enzyme are present in the preparations. Based upon the properties of other rhodaneses, the data are most consistent with modifications occurring on the sulfhydryl group of the active site cysteine of PspE. PspE1 was more highly modified than PspE2 (Table <bold><xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref></bold>). In fact, the predominant species of PspE present in PspE1 contained the equivalent mass of either one or two sulfur atoms (along with minor amounts of more highly modified PspE). The predominant enzyme forms present in PspE2 were PspE with one sulfur atom, along with smaller amounts of unmodified PspE. A substantial fraction of both PspE1 and PspE2 apparently is present as the sulfonate-modified form (E-SSO<sub>3</sub>H). Treatment of PspE2 with thiosulfate resulted in greater abundances of the modified forms of PspE. The observation that PspE2 released less than one equivalent of sulfur upon treatment with cyanide even though the predominant form present was the cysteine persulfide suggests that the sulfur-modified form of the enzyme is quite stable to this treatment.</p><p>Analysis of PspE by mass spectrometry confirmed that it was processed properly during its secretion to the periplasm, even when expressed at high levels. The molecular masses observed matched exactly those expected if the 19 residue signal sequence was removed.</p><p>The question arises as to the source of the covalent modifications of PspE. Thiosulfate is sometimes added to the buffers during purification of rhodaneses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R51">51</xref>]. This practice insures that the active site cysteine is modified, that is, converted to its persulfide form, and as such, is more resistant to oxidation. However, we did not include thiosulfate in the buffers used during purification, and so it is likely that PspE is covalently modified <italic>in vivo</italic>, and that such modifications are relatively stable. The modifications of PspE could arise from an endogenous metabolic pathway that yields the sulfur donor, or it is possible that the growth medium contains thiosulfate or other potential sulfur donors. To determine if growth medium contains a potential sulfur source, cyanolyzable sulfur was determined in LB medium. It was found that LB contains about 0.013 mM cyanolyzable sulfur by using PspE and a rhodanese assay run to completion. This sulfur could be the source of sulfur for modification of PspE prior to its purification by the standard protocol described above. The other possibility, that an endogenous pathway is responsible for production of a sulfur donor that modifies PspE, was tested by production of PspE during growth on a defined minimal medium that contains no added thiosulfate, but instead, only sulfate as sulfur source. PspE expression was induced during growth on M9 glucose minimal medium using strain BL21(DE3)(pHC4.1). It was found that the spent growth medium contained about 0.037 mM sulfur donor, as assessed by the PspE-catalyzed rhodanese reaction. Furthermore, PspE produced during growth on M9-glucose eluted as two peaks during cation exchange chromatography, the first of which contained cyanolyzable sulfur (data not shown). These results show that during normal growth, <italic>E. coli</italic> produces compounds that provide sulfur for covalent modification of PspE with sulfane sulfur.</p></sec><sec><title>Catalytic Properties of Purified PspE</title><p>Purified preparations of PspE exhibited specific activities of 150 -200 U/mg when assaying transfer of sulfur from thiosulfate to cyanide. Rhodaneses utilize a double-displacement (ping-pong) mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R52">52</xref>], which is also apparently the case for PspE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. In the previous study, PspE contained an N-terminal His<sub>6</sub> tag, which conceivably could affect the catalytic properties of PspE. Thus, kinetic properties of PspE were reinvestigated and alternate substrates were tested as sulfur donors/acceptors. PspE2 was used to study the kinetic properties in reactions containing 1 mM cysteine, which activates PspE activity. Data from activity measurements of purified PspE2 with various concentrations of thiosulfate at fixed concentrations of cyanide fit the equation describing a double-displacement mechanism. A plot of the data (Fig. <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref></bold>) yielded <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> values for thiosulfate and cyanide of 2.7 and 32 mM, respectively. The <italic>V</italic><sub>max</sub> value obtained was 410 &#x003bc;mol SCN<sup>-</sup>(min<sup>-1</sup>(mg<sup>-1</sup>, yielding a <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub><italic/>of 64 s<sup>-1</sup>. The kinetic constants were about the same as those reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>], where <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> values for thiosulfate and cyanide of 4.6 and 27 mM, respectively, were found. The small differences observed may be due to the presence or absence of the His-6 tag, or due to differences in concentrations of thiosulfate employed in the two studies. Thiosulfate concentrations in the present study were above and below <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> (0.5 &#x02013; 5 mM), whereas Adams <italic>et al</italic>. used high concentrations of thiosulfate (10 &#x02013; 50 mM).</p><p>As is the case for other rhodaneses, PspE also was capable of using a dithiol (dithiothreitol) as sulfur acceptor, ultimately releasing sulfide and oxidized dithiothreitol. For this reaction, the specific activity was about 300 U per mg of PspE, and the apparent <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> for dithiothreitol was about 10 mM when using either 4 mM or 10 mM thiosulfate. Finally, purified PspE possessed very low mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase activity. With cyanide as the sulfur acceptor (thiocyanate detection), the ratio of rhodanese to MST activity (5 U/mg) was 40; with 2-mercaptoethanol as sulfur acceptor (pyruvate detection), the ratio of rhodanese to MST activity (0.2 U/mg) was 900.</p><p>The <italic>E. coli</italic> rhodanese GlpE is inhibited only weakly by certain anions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>]. Greater inhibition by anions was observed for PspE. Addition of sodium sulfate or sodium chloride at 0.25 M resulted in about 50% inhibition of rhodanese activity. Addition of sodium phosphate at the same concentration resulted in about 65% inhibition. Sulfite, one of the products of the rhodanese reaction, strongly inhibited PspE activity (1 mM sodium sulfite resulted in more than 50% inhibition of rhodanese activity, data not shown).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Characterization of strains deficient in <italic>pspE</italic> and/or <italic>glpE </italic>established that the encoded single-domain rhodaneses are the major contributors of rhodanese activity in <italic>E. coli</italic>. Strains lacking both <italic>pspE</italic> and <italic>glpE</italic> had less than 5% of the activity found in wild-type strains. Lack of rhodanese activity had no apparent influence on the growth of <italic>E. coli</italic> under the various conditions tested. It was hypothesized that one of the single-domain rhodaneses might participate in trafficking of sulfur during biosynthesis of sulfur-containing cofactors. For example, the MoeB protein of <italic>E. coli</italic> lacks a rhodanese domain, and so might require a stand-alone rhodanese for sulfur trafficking during molybdopterin biosynthesis, as is the case for the human enzyme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>]. However, it is apparent that neither GlpE nor PspE is essential for molybdopterin synthesis, or for synthesis of other essential sulfur-containing cofactors. It is possible that one of the other sulfurtransferases present in <italic>E. coli</italic> cooperates with MoeB during molybdopterin synthesis. However, characterization of mutants deficient in each of the other rhodanese genes has not yielded further information regarding physiological function (unpublished data).</p><p><italic>E. coli</italic> and most other organisms possess multiple proteins with the rhodanese domain. Although the nine paralogs found in <italic>E. coli</italic> are easily identified based on their conserved sequence motifs, they are not very similar in sequence to one another, and some of their rhodanese domains are found fused to other unique protein domains (Fig. <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref></bold>). In addition, the proteins are found not only in the cytoplasm, but also in other subcellular locations (e.g., periplasm for PspE, cytoplasmic membrane for YgaP). Therefore, the different paralogs are likely to have defined, unique physiological roles. As pointed out in the Introduction, two of these proteins participate in modifying tRNAs (ThiI and YbbB), but the functions of the others must still be defined.</p><p>Results presented in this paper indicate that PspE is not likely to be an essential part of the phage shock regulon. Expression of rhodanese activity was not induced by stressors that result in induction of the other members of the <italic>psp</italic> operon (heat stress, osmotic stress), but instead was induced during growth on less preferred carbon sources such as glycerol. There are no obvious simple transcription terminators preceding <italic>pspE</italic>, and so it is likely that <italic>pspE</italic> expression also could be induced by signals that induce the <italic>pspABCD</italic> operon to its highest levels (filamentous phage infection, or in regulatory mutants). Microarray analysis in which mRNA levels in a <italic>pspF</italic> (positive regulator of <italic>psp</italic> gene expression) mutant were compared with those in a <italic>pspA</italic> (negative regulator) mutant strain revealed apparent co-regulation of <italic>pspE</italic> with the preceding genes of the operon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R53">53</xref>]. Previous studies also concluded that PspE is regulated independently from the other members of the <italic>psp</italic> operon, since a short, <italic>pspE</italic>-specific transcript was observed that is thought to originate from an independent, &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup>-dependent promoter presumably located within the 75-bp <italic>pspD-pspE</italic> intergenic region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R38">38</xref>]. The premise that <italic>pspE</italic> is not an essential member of the <italic>psp</italic> regulon is also supported by the observation that among organisms in which the <italic>pspABC</italic> and <italic>pspF</italic> genes are conserved, the <italic>pspD</italic> and <italic>pspE</italic> genes have limited conservation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>]. </p><p>Likewise, the present work demonstrates that <italic>glpE</italic> is not an essential part of the <italic>glp</italic> regulon, since the mutant strains grew normally on minimal medium containing glycerol. Our earlier work revealed that the main promoter for the <italic>glpEGR</italic> operon is not subject to specific regulation by GlpR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>], and analysis of completely sequenced bacterial genomes indicates that organization of <italic>glpE</italic>, <italic>glpG</italic> and <italic>glpR</italic> into an operon is not conserved. Therefore, it is possible that the context of <italic>glpE</italic> within the <italic>glpEGR</italic> operon of <italic>E. coli</italic> is fortuitous, and has no physiological relevance. </p><p>The catalytic properties of native PspE were similar to those of PspE containing an N-terminal polyhistidine tag [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>], and to those of previously characterized &#x0201c;accessible&#x0201d; rhodanese of <italic>E. coli</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R55">55</xref>]. In contrast, the properties of PspE were distinct from those of cytoplasmic rhodanese GlpE (Table <bold><xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref></bold>). The main distinction is that PspE has a much higher affinity for thiosulfate compared to GlpE. This property suggests that thiosulfate is in fact a physiological sulfur donor for PspE, which may not be the case for GlpE. Neither enzyme has a high affinity for cyanide, which indicates that these enzymes would not be effective for cyanide detoxification. Indeed, strains deficient in either or both enzymes were not more sensitive to cyanide, and overexpression of either enzyme did not confer resistance to cyanide (reference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>] and our unpublished results).</p><p>The various covalently modified forms of PspE detected by mass spectrometry are explained by the known mechanism of rhodanese catalysis, as well as by known reactions of compounds containing sulfur [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R56">56</xref>]. Rhodaneses catalyze the transfer of sulfur from thiosulfate by using a two step ping-pong mechanism, whereby a covalent enzyme-sulfur intermediate is formed on the active site cysteine of the enzyme during the first step:</p><p>E-SH + SSO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup> &#x02192; E-S-S<sup>-</sup> + HSO<sub>3</sub><sup>- </sup>(1)</p><p>During the second step, a thiophilic acceptor such as cyanide displaces the bound sulfur, returning the enzyme to its active form (E-SH):</p><p>E-S-S<sup>-</sup> + CN<sup>- </sup>&#x02192; E-SH + SCN<sup>- </sup>(2)</p><p>Presumably, PspE carrying a second sulfur atom is generated <italic>via </italic>further reaction of the enzyme-sulfur intermediate with another molecule of sulfur donor:</p><p>E-S-S<sup>-</sup> + SSO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup> &#x02192; E-S-SS<sup>-</sup> + HSO<sub>3</sub><sup>- </sup>(3)</p><p>The sulfonate form of the enzyme appears to be generated by reaction with thiosulfate, since its abundance increased following incubation of PspE2 with thiosulfate (reaction 4).

The persulfide sulfur is apparently quite resistant to removal by cyanide, as demonstrated by the fact that very little sulfur was removed from fraction PspE2 (Fig. <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref></bold>) even though the persulfide derivative was the most abundant form of PspE found in this fraction (Table <bold><xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref></bold>). It has been observed that the persulfide forms of GlpE and RhdA are stable and may be the active forms of those enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R57">57</xref>]. </p><p>The covalent modifications of the active site cysteine of PspE are likely to render the enzyme much less susceptible to oxidation or modification by thiol reagents.

It is possible that PspE participates in trafficking of sulfur needed for formation or repair of sulfur-containing clusters of enzymes within the periplasm, as suggested earlier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>]. PspE should be suited for such a role, since it is capable of storing multiple sulfur atoms at each active site.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENT</title><p>This work was supported by a grant from the Thomas F.
