Initiation requires binding of the replication initiator, the Origin Recognition Complex (ORC), to a consensus sequence within origins. In addition, other proteins bind to recognition sites in the vicinity of ORC and support initiation. In previous work, we identified Sum1 as an origin-binding protein that contributes to efficient replication initiation. Sum1 is part of the Sum1/Rfm1/Hst1 complex that represses meiotic genes during vegetative growth via histone deacetylation by the histone deacetylase (HDAC) Hst1.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In this study, we investigated how Sum1 affected replication initiation. We found that it functioned in initiation as a component of the Sum1/Rfm1/Hst1 complex, implying a role for histone deacetylation in origin activity. We identified several origins in the yeast genome whose activity depended on both Sum1 and Hst1. Importantly, <italic>sum1</italic>&#x00394; or <italic>hst1</italic>&#x00394; caused a significant increase in histone H4 lysine 5 (H4 K5) acetylation levels, but not other H4 acetylation sites, at those origins. Furthermore, mutation of lysines to glutamines in the H4 tail, which imitates the constantly acetylated state, resulted in a reduction of origin activity comparable to that in the absence of Hst1, showing that deacetylation of H4 was important for full initiation capacity of these origins.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Taken together, our results demonstrate a role for histone deacetylation in origin activity and reveal a novel aspect of origin regulation by chromatin. These results suggest recruitment of the Sum1/Rfm1/Hst1 complex to a number of yeast origins, where Hst1 deacetylated H4 K5.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Genome duplication by DNA replication is fundamental for the propagation of genetic material in all organisms. Eukaryotic chromosomes are replicated from multiple start sites called replication origins that initiate bidirectional DNA replication. Replication initiation at these origins is best understood in the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, where approximately 400 origins are used to replicate the DNA of the 16 chromosomes (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]). The ability of yeast origins to provide initiation and thus autonomous replication to plasmids has allowed the functional dissection of origin elements by measuring plasmid maintenance rates and has coined the term autonomous replicative sequence (ARS).</p><p>Plasmid maintenance studies have revealed that yeast origins have a modular structure. They all share a so-called ARS consensus sequence (ACS), which is a binding site for the origin recognition complex (ORC), the replication initiator. The six-subunit ORC complex binds to the origins in an ATP-dependent manner and, together with Cdc6 and Cdt1, recruits the MCM complex, which likely is the replicative helicase, to form the pre-initiation complex (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]). However, an ORC binding site alone is not sufficient to generate an origin. The ARS1 origin additionally contains three B elements that are required for full initiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The sequence closest to the ORC binding site, B1, cooperates in ORC binding and DNA unwinding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], and B2 is required for loading of the MCM complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Interestingly, the B3 site is a binding site for the protein Abf1, which functions as a transcription factor elsewhere in the genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The precise function of Abf1 in initiation is not known, but may include a role in nucleosome positioning and origin site selection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The involvement of transcription factors in initiation seems to be more general, because other transcription factors, Rap1 and Mcm1, have also been identified as origin binding factors that influence initiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Also, tethering acidic activators to origins improves initiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], suggesting that transcription factors have a general role in replication initiation.</p><p>Notably, individual ARS elements within the yeast genome share very little sequence conservation outside of the ACS. This observation supports the notion that yeast replication origins, in addition to ORC, bind several different auxiliary factors, among them transcription factors that aid in replication initiation, thus explaining why consensus sequences cannot easily be recognized. In this model, different subsets of origins are bound by different replication modulators that support full initiation of these origins.</p><p>In our previous work, we identified the Sum1 protein as a novel auxiliary initiation factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In contrast to the transcription factors described above, Sum1 in other contexts functions as a transcriptional repressor. It binds upstream of a number of middle sporulation genes and represses them during vegetative growth by recruiting the histone deacetylase (HDAC) Hst1 to the promoter, thus providing chromatin-mediated gene repression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In this function, Sum1 is part of a protein complex containing Hst1 and the bridging <underline>r</underline>epression <underline>f</underline>actor of <underline>M</underline>SEs, Rfm1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>In addition to its repressor function, Sum1 shows several links to ORC-mediated replication initiation as well as repression of the silent mating-type loci <italic>HML </italic>and <italic>HMR</italic>. The deletion of <italic>SUM1 (sum1</italic>&#x00394;) is synthetically lethal with a conditional mutation in <italic>ORC2, orc2-1</italic>, which causes an initiation defect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. This suggests that a number of origins require Sum1 as an auxiliary factor, such that cells cannot tolerate the loss of Sum1 when ORC function is compromised. Accordingly, a number of Sum1-dependent origins have been identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Sum1 also shows a weak physical interaction with ORC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Interestingly, a mutant version of Sum1, Sum1-1, was identified that bestows upon Sum1 an improved ability to interact with ORC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Sum1-1 thus is aberrantly recruited to a number of origins, among them the silent mating-type locus <italic>HMR</italic>, where it establishes Hst1-dependent gene silencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Natural Sum1 binds to the <italic>HML</italic>-E silencer and, in cooperation with other silencer-binding factors, promotes gene silencing at <italic>HML </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>Like all metabolic processes on DNA, replication initiation in eukaryotic cells must contend with the packaging of the DNA into chromatin, which generally restricts access to the DNA. Conceptually, the chromatin structure can be changed in two different ways, by the alteration of nucleosome position via chromatin remodelling, and by changes in the posttranslational modifications of the histones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Origin function has been shown to depend on the chromosomal context and the positioning of nucleosomes by ORC. Nucleosomes proximal to ORC facilitate the initiation of replication, whereas covering of the origin by nucleosomes interferes with initiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Furthermore, the SWI/SNF chromatin remodelling complex in some contexts is required for full stability of plasmids with a minimal origin, and tethering of an activator to an origin can create dependence of the origin on a chromatin remodeller [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].</p><p>Replication initiation is also influenced by histone acetylation. It changes timing of origin firing in that the absence of the HDAC Rpd3 causes late origins to fire early, whereas tethering the histone acetyltransferase Gcn5 to late origins advances their time of firing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. This suggests that the deacetylated chromatin state suppresses early initiation. Furthermore, histone acetylation affects the efficiency of replication initiation at a subset of origins. The absence of the HDAC Sir2 partially suppresses the initiation defect of a <italic>cdc6 </italic>mutation, indicating that initiation at some origins is more efficient when the chromatin is in the acetylated state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we asked how Sum1 exerted its function in replication initiation. We found that both <italic>rfm1</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>hst1</italic>&#x00394; were synthetically lethal with <italic>orc2-1</italic>, showing that the Sum1/Rfm1/Hst1 HDAC complex was required for Sum1's initiation function. We identified seven ARS elements whose initiation capacity depended on Sum1 and Hst1. In their absence, acetylation at lysine 5 of histone H4 was significantly increased at these origins. Also, mutation of the acetylatable lysines in the H4 tail to imitate the acetylated state caused reduced initiation of these plasmids. Taken together, our results show that Sum1 recruited the HDAC Hst1 to selected origins in the yeast genome, and that histone deacetylation by Hst1 at these origins was required for their full initiation function.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title><italic>hst1&#x00394; </italic>and <italic>rfm1&#x00394; </italic>were synthetically lethal with an <italic>orc2-1 </italic>mutation</title><p>Sum1 interacts with Hst1 via Rfm1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], and this Sum1/Rfm1/Hst1 complex represses a number of midsporulation genes.

This analysis revealed eight regions that showed binding of both ORC and Sum1, and we have shown for three of these fragments that they are ARS elements and require Sum1 for full initiation capacity. To further validate these putative Sum1-regulated origins, we asked whether the genes downstream of the Sum1 binding sites were repressed by Sum1 and Hst1. To this end, we queried existing microarray data for the expression of these genes in <italic>sum1</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>hst1</italic>&#x00394; cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. This analysis showed that six of the genes were upregulated upon deletion of <italic>SUM1 </italic>or <italic>HST1 </italic>(Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>), indicating that the localization of Sum1 to these fragments likely recruits Hst1 to repress the neighbouring gene through histone deacetylation. In the other two cases, Sum1 may solely act as a replication factor, because it does not repress the gene next door.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Gene expression change in <italic>sum1&#x00394; </italic>and <italic>hst1&#x00394; </italic>strains compared to wild-type</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left"><bold>ARS</bold></td><td align="left"><bold>Intergenic region</bold></td><td align="left"><bold>Gene</bold></td><td align="right"><bold><italic>sum1</italic>&#x00394;/WT*</bold></td><td align="right"><bold><italic>hst1</italic>&#x00394;/WT*</bold></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">433</td><td align="left"><italic>iYDR383C</italic></td><td align="left"><italic>NKP1</italic></td><td align="right">1.0</td><td align="right">1.0</td></tr><tr><td align="left">446</td><td align="left"><italic>iYDR523C</italic></td><td align="left"><italic>SPS1</italic></td><td align="right">21.6</td><td align="right">12.6</td></tr><tr><td align="left">447</td><td align="left"><italic>iYDR533C</italic></td><td align="left"><italic>HSP31</italic></td><td align="right">2.3</td><td align="right">1.6</td></tr><tr><td align="left">607</td><td align="left"><italic>iYFR023W</italic></td><td align="left"><italic>PES4</italic></td><td align="right">3.4</td><td align="right">2.0</td></tr><tr><td align="left">1013</td><td align="left"><italic>iYJL038C</italic></td><td align="left"><italic>YJL038C</italic></td><td align="right">2.8</td><td align="right">2.0</td></tr><tr><td align="left">1109</td><td align="left"><italic>iYKL059C</italic></td><td align="left"><italic>MPE1</italic></td><td align="right">0.8</td><td align="right">1.0</td></tr><tr><td align="left">1223</td><td align="left"><italic>iYLR307W</italic></td><td align="left"><italic>CDA1</italic></td><td align="right">25.5</td><td align="right">6.2</td></tr><tr><td align="left">1511</td><td align="left"><italic>iYOL024W</italic></td><td align="left"><italic>YOL024W</italic></td><td align="right">5.1</td><td align="right">1.5</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>* data from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>We next asked whether the ARS activity of these putative origins was regulated by Sum1 and Hst1.

There were three exceptions to this scenario. ARS433 plasmid maintenance was independent of Hst1, but ARS433 showed an Hst1-dependent increase in H4 K5 acetylation. Furthermore, Sum1 was required for full ARS activity of ARS606 and ARS1109, but apparently did not affect their acetylation state (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). Thus, there seem to be scenarios where the relationship between Sum1, histone deacetylation and initiation is more complex. In contrast to H4 K5, H4 K12 acetylation was not significantly increased at Sum1- and Hst1-dependent ARS elements.

The other origins showed no increase in acetylation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>).

ARS433, ARS446 showed no significant increase in H4 acetylation, and ARS606 and ARS1109 had the same state of acetylation in all three strains (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>). This was consistent with the notion that H4 K5 was the main target of the histone deacetylase Hst1, whereas other histone H4 lysine residues were minor or no targets of Hst1.</p><p>In summary, this analysis suggested that Sum1 regulated initiation at selected origins by recruiting Hst1 to these regions.</p></sec><sec><title>Changes in H4 acetylation caused defects in plasmid stability</title><p>The previous experiments raised the question whether increases in histone acetylation at origins by <italic>sum1</italic>&#x00394; or <italic>hst1</italic>&#x00394; were responsible for the loss of origin activity. To test this, we asked whether the activity at these origins was decreased in a strain in which the acetylatable lysine residues of the H4 N-terminus (K5, 8, 12 and 16) were mutated to glutamine. These mutations mimic a constant acetylation state of the respective histone H4 residue as is the case in the absence of the HDAC Hst1. We then analyzed the effect of this mutation on plasmid stability of the two plasmids that were most strongly affected by Sum1 and Hst1, ARS606 and ARS1013. Significantly, strains with ARS606 or ARS1013 plasmids showed a reduced growth rate in an H4 mutant strain as compared to wild-type (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>), indicating a loss of plasmid stability. In contrast, ARSH4, whose acetylation level did not alter in the absence of Hst1 or Sum1, did not show a reduced growth rate in the H4 mutant strain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). It has previously been reported that a simultaneous mutation of histone H4 K5, 8, 12, 16 to glutamine lengthens the cell cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. However, the observation that we did not detect a difference in the growth ability of mutant cells compared to wild type with the control plasmid (ARSH4) indicated that the growth differences with ARS606 and ARS1013 were specific to these origins and not due to a generalized growth defect of the H4 mutation. In summary, this suggested that increases in the acetylation level in <italic>sum1</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>hst1</italic>&#x00394; cells were responsible for the reduced origin activity of these ARS elements.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Mutation of lysine to glutamine in the N-terminal tail of histone H4 caused a similar initiation defect as <italic>sum1&#x00394; </italic>and <italic>hst1&#x00394;</italic></bold>.

In this study, we found that the DNA binding factor Sum1 recruited the histone deacetylase Hst1 within the Sum1/Rfm1/Hst1 complex to selected yeast origins to deacetylate histone H4. We found the most prominent effect for deacetylation of H4 K5, whereas other H4 acetylation sites were only affected at a minority of the origins.</p><p>How is histone deacetylation beneficial for initiation? The deacetylation of H4 K5 may help to stabilize the position of nucleosomes around the origin, for instance by altering DNA-histone contacts in the nucleosome, which has been shown to be important for initiation efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Alternatively, a particular deacetylated histone residue may recruit a histone-binding protein (complex) that recognizes H4 K5 in the deacetylated state and that has a positive effect on initiation. For instance, the acetylation may serve to recruit a chromatin remodeller that places the surrounding nucleosomes at a position that is conducive to initiation, which is in line with the observation of a role for chromatin remodellers in initiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. It is also possible that Sum1/Rfm1/Hst1 indirectly affects initiation by altering the expression of genes encoding replication proteins.</p><p>It is interesting to note that we found histone deacetylation by Hst1 to be beneficial for initiation, whereas the HDAC Sir2 seems to negatively regulate initiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Pappas et al. identified several origins whose plasmid maintenance capacity improved upon deletion of <italic>SIR2</italic>, while we found a decreased maintenance rate for a different set of origins in the absence of Hst1. Also, both <italic>hst1</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>sir2</italic>&#x00394; affected the survival of mutations in genes encoding replication factors, but <italic>hst1</italic>&#x00394; reduced their viability (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), whereas <italic>sir2</italic>&#x00394; enhanced it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. This indicates that the two HDACs both have a global effect on replication initiation, but that they influence initiation in opposite directions. This disparity may be explained by the different substrate specificities of the two enzymes. We show here that Hst1 mainly deacetylates H4 K5, while the main target of Sir2 is H4 K16 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The difference in specificity may lead to the recruitment of separate sets of regulatory factors that have different effects on nucleosome positioning and initiation. Thus, the effect of histone acetylation on efficiency of a particular origin seems to be highly dependent on the chromatin context of the origin. This is comparable to the effect of chromatin remodellers on transcription, where remodelling at one promoter can lead to the exposure of a transcription factor binding site, and thus to enhanced transcription, whereas remodelling at another promoter may lead to the occlusion of a binding site, and hence reduced expression of that gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p><p>It is also possible that the Sum1/Rfm1/Hst1 complex affects the time during S phase when an origin becomes active, much like increased histone acetylation at an origin by targeted Gcn5 or by the absence of Rpd3 advances initiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. In this respect, <italic>sum1</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>hst1</italic>&#x00394; may delay the firing of many origins, such that the origins are inactivated by replication forks emanating from earlier origins and thus decreased in their firing efficiency, leading to synthetic lethality in <italic>orc2-1 </italic>cells.</p><p>A further possibility is that the Sum1 complex influences initiation via an effect on transcription of the neighbouring gene, since transcription has previously been shown to influence origin firing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].</p><p>Although Hst1 is an HDAC, it is also conceivable that deacetylation of a non-histone target, for instance a pre-RC component or other regulator of initiation, has an impact on initiation. However, our observation that mutation of the acetylatable lysine residues in H4 caused a similar effect on initiation as the deletion of <italic>HST1 </italic>lends support to the notion that Hst1 affected initiation through histone deacetylation.</p><p>The fact that the Sum1/Rfm1/Hst1 complex becomes essential when ORC function is compromised by the <italic>orc2-1 </italic>mutation implies that a considerable number of origins in the yeast genome require this complex for initiation. One might then postulate that replication of the genome is not efficient enough in the absence of the Sum1 complex to support viability when initiation is reduced by an <italic>orc </italic>mutation. However, in our analysis we identified only seven origins as being regulated by this mechanism, a number that seems insufficient to explain the synthetic lethal effect. One possibility is that more Sum1-regulated origins exist that we have not identified in our analysis. Perhaps a re-analysis of the Sum1 localization data yields new Sum1 binding sites, as was the case for the re-evaluation of estrogen receptor binding data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>].</p><p>Alternatively, the Sum1 complex may have additional functions that affect a second pathway parallel to ORC function. Next to its role in replication initiation, ORC also has a role in sister chromatid cohesion in that it mediates the interaction of sister chromatids in a pathway parallel to the interaction mediated by cohesin complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Therefore, one explanation for the lethality between <italic>sum1</italic>&#x00394;/<italic>rfm1</italic>&#x00394;/<italic>hst1</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>orc2-1 </italic>is that it reflects an additional role for the Sum1/Rfm1/Hst1 complex in sister chromatid cohesion. However, since <italic>sum1</italic>&#x00394; cells show no defect in sister chromatid cohesion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], this Sum1-mediated cohesion pathway may act as a back-up in cells where ORC-mediated cohesion is impaired.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, we have identified a role for histone deacetylation by the Sum1/Rfm1/Hst1 complex in enhancing the efficiency of replication initiation at a subset of origins. As a generalized model, our work implies that DNA binding proteins that bind close to an ORC binding site, aid in replication initiation by recruiting chromatin-modifying activities, in this case a histone deacetylase, to the origin. We postulate that deacetylation of H4 K5 helps to position nucleosomes near the origin in a location favourable to replication initiation. Given that transcription factors are also involved in initiation in metazoans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], it will be interesting to see how they affect chromatin modification states at origins in multicellular organisms.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Strains and plasmids</title><p>The yeast strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>, respectively.
