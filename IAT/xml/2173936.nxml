Chk1 is phosphorylated and activated in the fission yeast <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> when cells are exposed to agents that damage DNA. Phosphorylation, kinase activation, and nuclear accumulation are events critical to the ability of Chk1 to induce a transient delay in cell cycle progression. The catalytic domain of Chk1 is well-conserved amongst all species, while there are only a few regions of homology within the C-terminus. A potential pseudosubstrate domain exists in the C-terminus of <italic>S. pombe</italic> Chk1, raising the possibility that the C-terminus acts to inhibit the catalytic domain through interaction of this domain with the substrate binding site.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>To evaluate this hypothesis, we characterized mutations in the pseudosubstrate region. Mutation of a conserved aspartic acid at position 469 to alanine or glycine compromises Chk1 function when the mutants are integrated as single copies, demonstrating that this domain of Chk1 is critical for function. Our data does not support, however, the hypothesis that the domain acts to inhibit Chk1 function as other mutations in the amino acids predicted to comprise the pseudosubstrate do not result in constitutive activation of the protein. When expressed in multi-copy, Chk1D469A remains non-functional. In contrast, multi-copy Chk1D469G confers cell survival and imposes a checkpoint delay in response to some, though not all forms of DNA damage.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>Thus, we conclude that this C-terminal region of Chk1 is important for checkpoint function and predict that a limiting factor capable of associating with Chk1D469G, but not Chk1D469A, interacts with Chk1 to elicit checkpoint activation in response to a subset of DNA lesions.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The DNA damage checkpoint pathway consists of DNA damage sensors, signal transducers, and effectors that interface with the cell cycle machinery to prevent inappropriate transitions when DNA repair is required.

Structurally, Chk1 consists of a highly conserved N-terminal kinase domain and a C-terminal non-catalytic domain. Evidence is mounting that critical aspects of Chk1 function are mediated through the C-terminal domain. We have previously reported that serine at position 345 in fission yeast Chk1 is phosphorylated <italic>in vivo</italic> and is required to activate Chk1 kinase activity in the presence of DNA damage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001427-Capasso1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Human Chk1 is also phosphorylated at S345, emphasizing the evolutionary importance of Chk1 in the checkpoint pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001427-Zhao1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001427-Liu1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Phosphorylation at these SQ sites in mammalian cells and fission yeast is achieved via ATR and its homolog Rad3, respectively, and is also dependent on the aforementioned checkpoint proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001427-Walworth1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001427-Walworth2">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001427-Liu1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001427-LopezGirona1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>.

Wee1 and Cdc25 regulate the activity of the cyclin-dependent kinase Cdc2 that controls entry into mitosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001427-Nurse1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. Hence, activated Chk1 achieves a cell cycle delay by targeting Wee1 and Cdc25. We have previously reported that Chk1 possesses a basal level of kinase activity that is elevated at least two-fold in response to DNA damage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001427-Capasso1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. The fact that Chk1 retains a basal level of kinase activity in the absence of checkpoint induction may explain why overexpression of Chk1 leads to a sustained G2 arrest, which is independent of Chk1 phosphorylation and the checkpoint pathway, and from which cells cannot recover. While mutating the phosphoacceptor site (S345A) does not affect Chk1 basal activity, phosphorylation is critical for Chk1's increased kinase activity towards substrates in the presence of damage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001427-Capasso1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, the C-terminus plays a crucial role in regulating Chk1 catalytic activity in response to DNA damage.</p><p>Studies of <italic>Xenopus</italic> and mammalian Chk1 support a model whereby the C-terminus structurally impinges on the N-terminal domain to suppress Chk1 catalytic activity in the absence of phosphorylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001427-Oe1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001427-Chen3">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. Specifically, analysis of the Chk1 N-terminal kinase domain crystal structure reveals that in the absence of the C-terminal domain, it retains an open conformation and is 20-fold more catalytically active towards substrates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001427-Chen3">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. Many kinases require phosphorylation within a region of the catalytic domain, known as the activation loop that serves as a molecular switch to turn on catalytic activity. Phosphorylation of a site within this loop secures the conformation of the activation and catalytic loops by stabilizing a cluster of positively charged side chains. There is no evidence that Chk1 is phosphorylated within this portion of the catalytic domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001427-Zhao1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Indeed, Chk1 appears to have substitutions of specific residues in the activation loop in lieu of phosphorylation, which consequently creates a basic environment to stabilize the activated structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001427-Chen3">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The observation that Chk1 has enhanced catalytic activity in the absence of the C-terminal half of the protein strongly suggests that this region possesses an autoinhibitory domain. An investigation of Xenopus Chk1 demonstrated the presence of a sequence in the C-terminal domain that could serve to inactivate the protein in a cell free extract system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001427-Katsuragi1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. A study focusing on a liver-specific isoform of Chk1 in rat that consists of only the C-terminal non-catalytic domain demonstrated that this fragment binds to the kinase domain of the Chk1 protein, consistent with the possibility that it could act to regulate the protein's activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001427-Shann1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, a short region of amino acids in the C-terminus of Chk1 resembles the Chk1 substrate recognition site <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001427-Hutchins1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001427-ONeill1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. To test the hypothesis that this region in the C-terminal domain might act as a pseudosubstrate to confer autoinhibition, mutations were made at this site and the phenotypes of cells expressing the mutant proteins analyzed. The data obtained do not support a role for this domain as an autoinhibitory site. However, the conserved aspartic acid residue at position 469 instead emerged as an important site for Chk1 activity. Specifically, substitution of aspartic acid 469 with glycine confers partial function when expressed in multiple copies, whereas substitution with alanine exhibits a loss of function phenotype even in multiple copies. Further investigation of the D469G mutant revealed that it only functions in multiple copies when cells are exposed to forms of DNA damage that result in base modifications or strand breaks. The mutant is non-functional when cells experience the collapse of replication forks or contain unligated DNA. This data is consistent with the possibility that substitution of D469 with glycine allows flexibility in the conformation of Chk1 that is not permitted when D469 is substituted with alanine. As a result, the conformational flexibility conferred by the glycine substitution permits Chk1 to respond to some, but not all forms of DNA damage.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>A putative pseudosubstrate domain in the C-terminus of Chk1</title><p>Using an in vitro kinase assay and variations of a known Chk1 substrate peptide, Hutchins et al. identified a sequence motif for Chk1 substrate recognition consisting of a hydrophobic residue (M, I, L, or V) at position &#x02013;5 and a basic residue (R or K) at position &#x02013;3, relative to the phosphoacceptor site <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001427-Hutchins1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001427-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>).

Mutation of D469 to alanine compromises function. Cells were assayed as in B.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0001427.g001"/></fig><p>To test this hypothesis, mutations to alanine were made at positions I464, R466 and D469 as well as the double mutant I464A,R466A and the triple mutant I464A,R466A,D469A. If these residues bind the catalytic domain to maintain Chk1 in an inactive state in the absence of damage, the autoinhibition model predicts that alanine substitutions at these sites would disrupt such intra-domain interactions and render Chk1 constitutively active. Hence, substitutions in the predicted pseudosubstrate domain should result in an elongated cellular morphology indicative of a sustained checkpoint delay in the absence of damage. Plasmids expressing these mutants were introduced into a strain with a deletion of the <italic>chk1</italic> gene and the resulting strains were evaluated microscopically for an elongated phenotype. Contrary to what would be expected for constitutively active mutants, the individual alanine substitutions for I464, R466 and D469 (as well as the double and triple mutants) did not result in an elongated cellular phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001427-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). In fact, in the absence of damage, all of the mutants resemble a control strain transformed with the wild type plasmid suggesting that mutation of these residues does not affect cell cycle progression in the absence of damage. The mutants were also tested for Chk1 checkpoint function as measured by the ability to survive exposure to DNA damage generated by UV light. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001427-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>, the I464A and R466A mutants, as well as the double mutant, are as functional as wild type Chk1. Furthermore, each of these three mutated proteins is phosphorylated in response to DNA damage generated by the topoisomerase I poison camptothecin (CPT, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001427-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>). In contrast, substitution of alanine for D469 compromises the function of Chk1, rendering cells sensitive to UV light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001427-g001">Fig. 1E</xref>). Thus, while mutating residues within the hypothetical pseudosubstrate site had no effect on Chk1 activation in the absence of damage, arguing against the pseudosubstrate hypothesis, mutation of D469 did compromise function in the presence of DNA damage indicating that the highly conserved aspartic acid at that position is important for Chk1 function in the DNA damage checkpoint pathway.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Allele specific behavior of mutations at D469</title><p>In a previous genetic screen searching for damage-sensitive alleles of <italic>chk1</italic>, we identified a mutant with a substitution of glycine for aspartic acid at position 469 along with substitution of glycine for aspartic acid at a non-conserved position, 363 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001427-Wan1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. To determine whether the two mutations contribute independently to Chk1 function, single mutants were constructed to produce Chk1D363G and Chk1D469G from their own promoters on multi-copy plasmids.

Surprisingly, by Western blot of a whole cell extract, it was not possible to detect phosphorylation of Chk1D469G upon exposure to UV light, despite the robust behavior of the protein in the UV survival assay. Given the generally strong correlation between phosphorylation and function, we examined Chk1 phosphorylation more carefully by immunoprecipitation with the HA antibody followed by Western blot with an antibody raised against a phosphorylated serine 345-containing peptide.

Consistent with the observation that Chk1D469A does not function in response to DNA damage, phosphorylation of this protein was not detected. We conclude that Chk1D469G is phosphorylated in response to DNA damage, albeit to a lesser extent than the wild-type protein.

A wild-type strain (972) with its checkpoint pathway intact is quite resistant to UV damage; however, loss of Rad3 function severely compromises survival, even if Chk1 is proficient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001427-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>).

Thus, survival of a strain expressing Chk1D469G still requires activation of the checkpoint pathway by Rad3.</p><p>To further characterize the Chk1D469G allele we examined its catalytic activity using a peptide-based assay. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001427-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>, Chk1D469G immunoprecipitated from untreated cells has essentially background levels of kinase activity, approximately the level of signal observed when the &#x0201c;kinase dead&#x0201d; Chk1D155A protein is assayed. Yet, activity of Chk1D469G, like that of wild-type Chk1, is stimulated several fold when the kinase is immunoprecipitated from cells exposed to UV light. Given the limited level of catalytic activity exhibited by the Chk1D469G protein, we wondered whether kinase activity was essential for its function. Therefore, we created a double mutant of the D469G allele with the D155A allele, a mutation in a highly conserved residue present in a multitude of protein kinases that compromises the catalytic activity of the protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001427-Capasso1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001427-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>, mutation of D155A in the context of D469G completely inactivates the protein with regard to function as measured by the ability to confer survival upon exposure to UV light.

However, it is conceivable that the D469G protein may be activated at a later time period compared to the wild type protein and consequently is missed in the limited time frame of the assay. Therefore, we assayed activation of the mutant protein as compared to the wild type protein over a 45-minute time course. As with the single time point assay, WT Chk1 exhibits a basal level of kinase activity, which is stimulated 3-fold in response to damage as early as 5 minutes into the assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001427-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>). In contrast, Chk1D469G exhibited a damage-induced increase in activity that remained far below the level of basal catalytic activity exhibited by WT Chk1 even after a 45-minute incubation time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001427-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>). As the low level of activity displayed by Chk1D469G demonstrably promotes checkpoint activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001427-g002">Fig. 2A&#x02013;B</xref>), while the Chk1D469A mutant does not, it was of interest to determine how the catalytic activity of the checkpoint deficient Chk1D469A mutant compared to D469G. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001427-g004">Figure 4D</xref>, Chk1D469A possesses a basal level of kinase activity that falls below the range of basal activity displayed by Chk1D469G. Interestingly, when UV irradiated, Chk1D469A does undergo an increase in activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001427-g004">Fig. 4D</xref>). Nevertheless, the level of UV-induced kinase activation in the Chk1D469A mutant fails to reach the levels of the damage-induced activation exhibited by the checkpoint proficient Chk1D469G and is clearly not adequate to promote checkpoint activation or cellular survival. Thus, it appears that Chk1D469G unveils threshold levels of phosphorylation and catalytic activity that are minimally required to trigger the DNA damage checkpoint. On the contrary, Chk1D469A with much lower catalytic activity and devoid of damage-dependent phosphorylation is incapable of checkpoint activation. These results suggest that Chk1D469G is partially functional while D469A represents a loss-of-function allele.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Chk1D469G is checkpoint proficient for UV- or CPT-induced DNA damage</title><p>Cells expressing Chk1D469G display a level of survival to UV-irradiation that is comparable to that of a strain expressing WT Chk1, while cells expressing Chk1D469A are much more sensitive.

While Chk1D469G confers levels of survival that parallel the WT strain in response to either CPT or UV treatment, the level of phosphorylation of the mutant protein is much reduced as compared to wild type. Nonetheless, Chk1D469G is competent to induce a checkpoint dependent cell cycle delay. The ability of Chk1 mutants to function proficiently with minimal levels of phosphorylation is not unprecedented. Two independent groups observed that other C-terminal fission yeast mutants in the vicinity of D469G (E472D and I484T) exhibit significantly reduced phosphorylation levels and yet are checkpoint proficient <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001427-Francesconi1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001427-Latif1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, in an effort to elucidate the minimal structural requirements for checkpoint activation, <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts were utilized to demonstrate that the length of single stranded DNA between the free ends of primed DNA, influenced the degree of Chk1 phosphorylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001427-MacDougall1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. Perhaps the Chk1D469G protein interacts less efficiently with the damage signaling complex, thereby reducing the level of signaling to Chk1.</p><p>We have previously shown that Chk1 catalytic activity is crucial to elicit the DNA damage checkpoint response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001427-Capasso1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Evidence from mammalian cells, <italic>Xenopus,</italic> and fission yeast have established that Chk1 kinase activity is elevated in response to DNA damage signals, however, the precise mechanism of Chk1 activation has yet to be elucidated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001427-Capasso1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001427-Liu1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001427-Latif1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001427-Kumagai1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. It has been hypothesized that the C-terminus of Chk1 acts to regulate its kinase activity by suppressing Chk1 catalytic activity until it is phosphorylated, at which point a conformational change leads to derepression of the catalytic domain. This conjecture is supported by both the crystal structure of the Chk1 catalytic domain and mutational studies that reveal C-terminal disruptions of Chk1 exhibit increased intrinsic kinase activity even in the absence of damage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001427-Chen3">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Bearing in mind these reports and their implication that the C-terminal domain of Chk1 may have a negative impact on its catalytic activity, we might have expected that the checkpoint proficient Chk1D469G mutant would display an elevated level of kinase activity both in the absence and presence of damage. However, we observed that Chk1D469G had significantly reduced basal activity that was stimulated greater than two-fold in response to damage and was apparently sufficient to enforce a mitotic delay. This implies that there is a threshold level of activity that is adequate to activate the checkpoint, and that WT Chk1 is normally activated in excess of the level that is minimally required to enforce a delay. Alternatively, it is possible that the absolute level of activity is not the critical factor for Chk1 function, but rather a change in magnitude of Chk1 activity may very well be the important parameter. It is noteworthy that a role for Chk1 in the spindle checkpoint has begun to emerge, requiring only the basal catalytic activity of Chk1 for function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001427-Zachos1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. Phosphorylation of Chk1 in <italic>Xenopus</italic> in response to spindle perturbations does not affect the sites conventionally targeted by the ATM/ATR kinases. This suggests that either ATM/ATR have the potential to mediate phosphorylation of Chk1 at non-canonical sites, or alternatively, that phosphorylation is mediated by another caffeine-sensitive kinase.</p><p>Based on the substrate specificity determinants for Chk1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001427-Hutchins1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, we hypothesized that the region containing D469 might serve as a pseudosubstrate recognition site that mediates an autoinhibitory interaction with the catalytic domain. While it is quite possible that Chk1 is regulated by autoinhibition, we have shown here that mutations of the C-terminal residues I464 and R466 to alanine do not render Chk1 in a constitutively activated state. The I464A and R466A mutants retain function, though mutation of D469 to alanine inactivates the protein, both in terms of checkpoint function and catalytic activity. Intriguingly, mutation to glycine allows some function when Chk1D469G is expressed at greater than one copy per cell, though only when cells are challenged with some types of DNA damage. Glycine residues have a well-characterized architectural role in proteins as they often enable helical turns and bends (see for example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001427-Onishi1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>). In fact it has been suggested that glycine residues may be essential for switching proteins between distinct functional states because of the conformational freedom they provide to the protein backbone. We speculate that the glycine substitution creates a flexible hinge that permits Chk1 to exist in an open conformation. As a result, Chk1D469G is maintained in a functional state poised for mediating interactions with components of the checkpoint pathway albeit with reduced levels of phosphorylation and catalytic activity.</p><p>Alternatively, it is also possible that the Chk1D469G mutant is simply a partial, rather than complete, loss-of-function mutant. The ability of the D469G mutant to partially restore DNA damage-induced checkpoint function only when present in multiple copies supports this possibility, though it does not explain why Chk1D469G supports survival in response to some, but not all forms of DNA damage. To account for this observation, one might imagine that different types of DNA damage may demand different levels of Chk1 activity to promote survival. The reduced activity of Chk1D469G may be sufficient for lesions arising from base modifications or strand breaks, but not for conditions that generate collapsed forks or unligated DNA.</p><p>This is not the first report of lesion specific activation of fission yeast Chk1. Indeed, it has been reported that a particular set of <italic>chk1</italic> mutants can distinguish between lesions induced in G2 phase and structures generated by collapsed replication forks, and that these signal distinct checkpoint responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001427-Francesconi1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. The mechanisms used by checkpoints to recognize different classes of DNA lesions are not clear. Some reports suggest that the ATM and ATR kinases target specific checkpoint components depending on the genomic lesion identified, while others suggest that it is not in fact lesion recognition, but the processing of diverse lesions by distinct DNA repair factors which ultimately recruits and activates particular checkpoint components <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001427-Abraham1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001427-Shiloh1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>. While the precise checkpoint activating structure remains elusive, studies in <italic>Xenopus</italic> suggest that ongoing replication may in fact alter the minimal requirements for checkpoint activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001427-MacDougall1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, checkpoint activation during S phase likely differs from activation when replication has been completed.</p><p>Chk1 interacting proteins that promote damage specific responses have been identified. The BRCT motif-containing adaptor protein Crb2, which is required for Chk1 activation is required for checkpoint signaling induced by UV, methyl-methane sulfonate (MMS) and ionizing radiation, but is dispensable when cells are exposed to HU <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001427-Saka1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001427-Willson1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>. However, we observe that supplying Crb2 in excess cannot rescue the survival of the single-copy checkpoint-deficient Chk1D469G mutant (unpublished data). In a Xenopus system, depletion of Claspin, a mediator protein for Chk1 activation, eliminates Chk1 phosphorylation in response to stalled replication forks, but depletion of both Claspin and BRCA1 is necessary to eliminate Chk1 phosphorylation when the damage signal arises from a double strand break <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001427-Yoo1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>. By analogy, it is possible that Chk1D469G responds to some, but not all mediators of the DNA damage signal in S. pombe. We anticipate that an unbiased genetic screen to identify such factors that can support survival when Chk1D469G is present in single copy may reveal additional mediators that contribute to damage specific checkpoint responses.</p><p>A thorough understanding of the mechanism of Chk1-dependent checkpoint activation is critical for the development of anti-cancer strategies, as it is apparent that inactivating Chk1 can sensitize cells to genotoxic therapies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001427-Chen1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001427-Jackson1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. While loss-of-function alleles of Chk1 have been key to defining the role of Chk1 in the cellular response to DNA damage, it is clear that our understanding of the checkpoint response is far from complete. Mutant alleles of Chk1 provide valuable tools for genetically dissecting the checkpoint pathway and ultimately may contribute to the determination of how best to target Chk1 for therapeutic efficacy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Plasmids, yeast strains, media, and growth conditions</title><p>Strains used in these studies are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0001427-t001">Table 1</xref>.
