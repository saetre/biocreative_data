Mutations in myotubularin cause myotubular myopathy, a devastating congenital myopathy with unclear pathogenesis and no current therapies. Myotubular myopathy was the first described of a growing list of conditions caused by mutations in proteins implicated in membrane trafficking. To advance the understanding of myotubularin function and disease pathogenesis, we have created a zebrafish model of myotubular myopathy using morpholino antisense technology. Zebrafish with reduced levels of myotubularin have significantly impaired motor function and obvious histopathologic changes in their muscle. These changes include abnormally shaped and positioned nuclei and myofiber hypotrophy. These findings are consistent with those observed in the human disease. We demonstrate for the first time that myotubularin functions to regulate PI3P levels in a vertebrate <italic>in vivo</italic>, and that homologous myotubularin-related proteins can functionally compensate for the loss of myotubularin. Finally, we identify abnormalities in the tubulo-reticular network in muscle from myotubularin zebrafish morphants and correlate these changes with abnormalities in T-tubule organization in biopsies from patients with myotubular myopathy. In all, we have generated a new model of myotubular myopathy and employed this model to uncover a novel function for myotubularin and a new pathomechanism for the human disease that may explain the weakness associated with the condition (defective excitation&#x02013;contraction coupling). In addition, our findings of tubuloreticular abnormalities and defective excitation-contraction coupling mechanistically link myotubular myopathy with several other inherited muscle diseases, most notably those due to ryanodine receptor mutations. Based on our findings, we speculate that congenital myopathies, usually considered entities with similar clinical features but very disparate pathomechanisms, may at their root be disorders of calcium homeostasis.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Congenital myopathies are inherited muscle conditions typically presenting in early childhood. They are individually rare, but as a group are likely as common as conditions such as muscular dystrophy. The zebrafish is an emerging experimental system for the study of myopathies. We have utilized the zebrafish to develop a model of myotubular myopathy, one of the most severe childhood muscle diseases and a condition whose pathogenesis is poorly understood. We have generated fish that have the characteristic behavioral and histological features of human myotubular myopathy. Using this model, we then made novel insights into the pathogenesis of myotubular myopathy, including the identification of abnormalities in the muscle tubulo-reticular system. We subsequently identified similar changes in muscle from patients with myotubular myopathy, corroborating the importance of our zebrafish findings. Because a functional tubulo-reticular complex is required for normal muscle contraction, we speculate that the weakness observed in myotubular myopathy is caused by breakdown of this network. In all, our study is the first to identify a potential pathomechanism to explain the clinical features of myotubular myopathy. Furthermore, by revealing abnormalities in the tubulo-reticular system, we provide a novel link between myotubular myopathy and several other congenital myopathies.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Myotubular myopathy is a severe, X-linked congenital myopathy with onset in infancy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000372-Jungbluth1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

Over 200 mutations have been reported in the myotubularin gene, the majority of which result in loss of functional gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000372-Jungbluth1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Myotubularin is the only gene associated with myotubular myopathy. It is the canonical member of a large family of homologous proteins called the myotubularin related proteins (MTMRs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000372-Clague1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Of interest is the fact that several MTMRs are mutated in human neurologic diseases, including mutation of MTMR14 in an autosomal form of centronuclear myopathy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000372-Tosch1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Myotubularin was originally characterized as a protein tyrosine phosphatase, but was subsequently found instead to function primarily as a lipid phosphatase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000372-Blondeau1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000372-Taylor1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>.

Most recently, Cao and colleagues have demonstrated using RNAi in A431 cells that knockdown of myotubularin results in a 60&#x02013;120&#x00025; increase in PI3P levels, thus substantiating the requirement for myotubularin in the regulation of endogenous PI3P <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000372-Cao1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. Increased PI3P levels have also been observed in yeast lacking the myotubularin homolog ymr1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000372-Taylor1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000372-Parrish1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. As yet, however, this activity has not been directly examined in whole vertebrates or in specific organ systems, including muscle. The functional importance of myotubularin's phosphatase activity is assumed from the fact that missense mutations that alter critical amino acids in the phosphatase domain without affecting protein stability result in myotubular myopathy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000372-Jungbluth1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Phosphoinositides are implicated in myriad cellular functions, chief among them the regulation of membrane traffic and vesicle/organelle movement <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000372-DeMatteis1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Because it acts to modify certain PI residues, myotubularin is assumed to function as a regulator of membrane traffic and in particular the movements of vesicles between endosomal compartments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000372-Nicot1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000372-Dowling1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Overexpression of myotubularin in cell culture delays traffic out of the endosomal compartment and causes vacuole accumulation. However, as with myotubularin phosphatase activity, a role for myotubularin in the regulation of membrane traffic <italic>in vivo</italic> and specifically in skeletal muscle has yet to be determined. In addition, unlike with other myopathies due to altered membrane traffic (examples include Danon Disease due to LAMP2 mutation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000372-DiMauro1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>), myotubular myopathy is not characterized by the pathologic accumulation of vesicles.</p><p>Many critical questions remain unanswered concerning myotubularin function and myotubular myopathy pathogenesis. These include whether myotubularin truly functions as a lipid phosphatase and regulator of membrane traffic <italic>in vivo</italic>. Furthermore, the relationship between the proposed functions of myotubularin and disease pathogenesis is not clear. The same is true with the association between the unique histologic appearance of the muscle in myotubular myopathy patient biopsies and the etiology of muscle weakness and hypotonia. The lack of knowledge concerning these fundamental issues is a significant barrier in the development of therapeutic strategies for the disease.</p><p>A murine model of myotubular myopathy exists, generated by targeted mutagenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000372-BujBello1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. It recapitulates the clinical and histopathologic features of the disease, thus confirming the association between myotubularin and myotubular myopathy. However, due in part to technical limitations with the murine system, it does not address many of the fundamental questions mentioned above. To begin answering these questions, and to develop a model system amenable to rapid testing of therapeutic strategies, we report here the development of a zebrafish model of myotubular myopathy. Using antisense morpholino technology, we generated zebrafish embryos with reduced myotubularin protein expression. These embryos have severely impaired motor function, muscle fiber atrophy and the presence of large, abnormally located nuclei. These findings are reminiscent of those seen in myotubular myopathy. We also demonstrate that loss of myotubularin causes increased PI3P levels in muscle, thus confirming for the first time that myotubularin functions as a lipid phosphatase in a vertebrate model system. Using RNA-mediated rescue experiments, we show that the homologous myotubularin-related genes MTMR1 and MTMR2 are able to functionally compensate for the loss of myotubularin. Lastly, and most significantly, we identify alterations in the T-tubule and sarcoplasmic reticular networks in morphant zebrafish muscle. We confirm that similar disorganization of the tubulo-reticular network is present in biopsy samples from patients with myotubular myopathy. In all, we have successfully created a zebrafish model of myotubular myopathy, and have used this model to both answer fundamental questions concerning myotubularin function and to uncover a novel mechanism to explain the pathogenesis of the disorder.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Morpholino Knockdown of Zebrafish Myotubularin</title><p>To study the function of myotubularin (MTM1) in zebrafish, we employed antisense morpholinos to achieve functional gene knockdown. We first identified the zebrafish homolog of MTM1 using the Ensembl genome browser (ENSDARG00000037560). By bioinformatics and RT-PCR from zebrafish embryonic RNA, we found that MTM1 and 12 of 14 of the MTM1-related gene products (MTMRs) are expressed in the developing fish (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000372.s001">Figure S1</xref>). We then designed morpholinos to the translation start site (ATG MO), to the splice donor site of exon 1 (Ex1 MO), and to the splice acceptor site of exon 3 (Ex3 MO). Both splice morphants were predicted to result in the loss of an exon and the introduction of a premature stop codon. These morpholinos were independently injected into 1&#x02013;4 cell stage embryos and then embryos were phenotypically analyzed at 24, 48, and 72 hours post fertilization (hpf). A control morpholino (CTL MO) designed to a random sequence of nucleotides not found in the zebrafish genome was used to control for injection related non-specific effects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000372-Dowling2">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The efficacy of the ATG morpholino to interfere with translation was verified by the demonstration of reduced myotubularin protein levels by immunofluorescence and western blot analysis of samples from ATG MO injected embryos (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000372.s002">Figure S2A, B</xref>). The ability of the splice morphants to alter myotubularin RNA processing and stability was confirmed by RT PCR analysis using primers to flanking exons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000372.s002">Figure S2C</xref>). Of note, all 3 morpholinos yielded indistinguishable phenotypes. The ATG morpholino was used for analysis and quantitation in all subsequent experimentation, with all phenotypic observations additionally verified using the two splice morpholinos.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Knockdown of Zebrafish Myotubularin Results in Abnormal Skeletal Muscle Function</title><p>Zebrafish embryos undergo rapid skeletal muscle development, and multinucleated myotubes are present and easily recognizable by 24 hours post fertilization.

We show that MTMR1 and MTMR2, the MTMRs with the highest homology to myotubularin, are not expressed in zebrafish muscle. Furthermore, exogenous ubiquitous expression of either gene rescued the myotubularin morpholino phenotype. Importantly, expression of these MTMRs in control fish did not result in obvious phenotypic abnormalities. This implies that increasing the expression of either MTMR1 or MTMR2 in patient muscle is a viable potential treatment strategy for myotubular myopathy.</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>T-Tubule Abnormalities Due to Loss of Myotubularin in Zebrafish and Man</title><p>Perhaps the most significant finding from our study is that decreasing myotubularin expression or function results in both structural and functional abnormalities in the T-tubule network. This finding is significant for several reasons. The first is that it provides the first viable explanation for why patients (and mice and zebrafish) have significant weakness. T-tubules are critical for several aspects of muscle contractions and force generation, in particular for excitation-contraction coupling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000372-Zhang1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. Impairment of this network should clearly lead to diminished force production and muscle weakness. We demonstrate this functionally in the zebrafish, as embryos with decreased myotubularin have excitation-contraction coupling abnormalities.</p><p>A second significance to these data is that they provide a plausible hypothesis for myotubularin function in myofibers. T-tubules biogenesis and maintenance is dependent on the continuous recycling of its membranous contents <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000372-Dowling1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Membrane recycling is in turn dependent on tight regulation of phosphoinositides. Therefore, one possible explanation for our results is that myotubularin functions to regulate the recycling of T-tubule membrane components via its ability to participate in the regulation of phosphoinositide levels.</p><p>An association between T-tubule homeostasis and myotubularin is especially attractive given the potential functional similarities between T-tubule recycling and endosomal dynamics. Previous studies have shown that both endosomes and T-tubules share similar structural and regulatory components. Most notably, BIN1/amphiphysin2 and dynamin-2 are critical regulators of membrane trafficking at the endosome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000372-Lajoie1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000372-Ren1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>, and both are expressed at the T-tubule <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000372-Nicot2">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, BIN1 is required for T-tubule biogenesis in cultured myocytes and for T-tubule organization in Drosophila <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000372-Lee1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000372-Razzaq1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. As discussed below, mutations in both BIN1 and dynamin-2 result in centronuclear myopathy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000372-Jungbluth1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, a myopathy with similar pathologic features to myotubular myopathy. Such overlapping roles are also seen with caveoli, which are critical for both T-tubule formation/maintenance and for endocytosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000372-Galbiati1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000372-Carozzi1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, given the many observations functionally linking T-tubule dynamics and the regulation of endosomes, it seems very likely that myotubularin's primary function in muscle is controlling T-tubule dynamics in a fashion analogous to that described for its regulation of endosomal trafficking <italic>in vitro</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000372-Tsujita1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000372-Cao1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>A final importance relates to other congenital myopathies. Traditionally, congenital myopathies are considered a group of independent conditions, distinguished by their histopathologic features on muscle biopsy. However, they are in general similar in clinical presentation, characterized by neonatal hypotonia and non-progressive weakness <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000372-North1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. The discovery of T-tubule abnormalities in myotubular myopathy now pathogenically links the three most prevalent groups of congenital myopathies. Core myopathies are caused by mutations in the ryanodine receptor (RYR1) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000372-Jungbluth2">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>, the calcium channel located at the T-tubule/sarcoplasmic reticulum border that is required for excitation-contraction coupling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000372-Hirata1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, and by mutations in Selenoprotein-N <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000372-Jungbluth3">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>, a modifier of RYR1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000372-Jurynec1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. Most nemaline myopathies are caused by mutations in the components of the thin filaments, proteins which function downstream of RYR1 and calcium release to initiate contraction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000372-Gommans1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>. Along with the centronuclear myopathies due to BIN1 (where T-tubule abnormalities have already been documented) and dynamin-2 mutation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000372-Jungbluth1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, myotubular myopathy likely is an &#x0201c;upstream&#x0201d; defect, resulting in abnormalities in the underlying T-tubule and sarcoplasmic reticular structure upon which RYR1 function is dependent.</p><p>In light of this commonality between congenital myopathies, the next important step is to see if modifiers of excitation-contraction coupling and T-tubule function can ameliorate the muscle weakness in the relevant disease models. We are currently at work developing and testing such agents in our zebrafish model of myotubular myopathy.</p></sec><sec id="s3e"><title>Summary</title><p>We have developed a new vertebrate model of myotubular myopathy, which has allowed us to answer fundamental questions regarding myotubularin function, and to make novel insights into the pathogenesis of the human disease.
