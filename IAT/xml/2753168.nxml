In the case of pre-60S particles, these steps involve the release of shuttling maturation factors and transport receptors. In this study, we report a new maturation step in the 60S biogenesis pathway in budding yeast. We show that efficient release of the nucleolar/nuclear ribosomal-like protein Mrt4 (homologous to the acidic ribosomal P-protein Rpp0) from pre-60S particles requires the highly conserved protein Yvh1, which associates only with late pre-60S particles. Cell biological and biochemical analyses reveal that Mrt4 fails to dissociate from late pre-60S particles in <italic>yvh1&#x00394;</italic> cells, inducing a delay in nuclear pre&#x02013;ribosomal RNA processing and a pre-60S export defect in <italic>yvh1&#x00394;</italic> cells.

To produce a ribosome, eukaryotic cells must assemble &#x0003e;70 ribosomal proteins (r-proteins) with four different ribosomal RNA (rRNA) species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Venema and Tollervey, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tschochner and Hurt, 2003</xref>). The concerted actions of all three transcription machineries (RNA polymerases I, II, and III) need to be coordinated to ensure the high efficiency and accuracy of ribosome production: Pol I produces 25S/28S, 5.8S, and 18S rRNA, Pol III synthesizes 5S rRNA, and Pol II transcribes the mRNAs for the r-proteins. Additionally, the process of ribosome assembly requires numerous nonribosomal factors, termed trans-acting factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Venema and Tollervey, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tschochner and Hurt, 2003</xref>). The final outcome of this spatially and temporally coordinated effort is that every second, a growing yeast cell delivers up to 40 nascent ribosomal subunits from the nucleolus, the primary site of assembly, to the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tschochner and Hurt, 2003</xref>).</p><p>Most of our current understanding of this highly dynamic, regulated multistep process comes from studies in budding yeast. The combined use of genetic, cell biological, and proteomic methods has uncovered &#x0003e;150 trans-acting factors that are required for the assembly and maturation of preribosomal particles as they travel from the nucleolus to the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Venema and Tollervey, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fatica and Tollervey, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fromont-Racine et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tschochner and Hurt, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Granneman and Baserga, 2004</xref>). Moreover, tandem affinity purification (TAP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rigaut et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Puig et al., 2001</xref>) and sensitive mass spectrometric methods have allowed refinement of the ribosome assembly scheme, which was originally proposed upon identification of 90S, 66S, and 43S preribosomal particles in the mid-70s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Trapman et al., 1975</xref>). These approaches have uncovered changes in protein and rRNA composition of several distinct and successive pre-40S and -60S ribosomal particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bassler et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Harnpicharnchai et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fatica et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Grandi et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nissan et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Saveanu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sch&#x000e4;fer et al., 2003</xref>). Nevertheless, the functions of the majority of identified trans-acting factors are only starting to be unraveled.</p><p>Early pre-60S particles associate with &#x0223c;100 trans-acting factors along their biogenesis pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fatica and Tollervey, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fromont-Racine et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tschochner and Hurt, 2003</xref>). As pre-60S particles travel through the nucleoplasm toward the nuclear pore complex, trans-acting factors are released at distinct stages and recycled back to participate in new rounds of biogenesis steps. These events are most likely triggered by transiently associating energy-consuming enzymes, which result in sequential reduction of complexity and acquisition of export competence. Export-competent pre-60S particles associate with transport factors, which promote interactions with the nuclear pore complex. Among these factors is the conserved adaptor Nmd3, which contains a nuclear export sequence that is recognized by the nuclear export receptor Crm1/Xpo1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ho et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gadal et al., 2001</xref>). Recently, additional shuttling factors such as the HEAT repeat&#x02013;containing protein Rrp12, the mRNA export factor Mex67-Mtr2, and Arx1 were shown to facilitate the nuclear export of pre-60S particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Oeffinger et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bradatsch et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yao et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hung et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>The majority of trans-acting factors that associate with pre-60S particles during early biogenesis steps are released in the nucleolus/nucleus. However, few factors (Nmd3, Rlp24, Tif6, Nog1, Arx1, and Alb1) remain associated with pre-60S particles and are escorted to the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Senger et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Saveanu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hedges et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hung and Johnson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lebreton et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pertschy et al., 2007</xref>). The release and import of these factors to the nucleus constitute late pre-60S maturation steps, which are required for the formation of translation-competent 60S subunits. These steps are crucial for the 60S biogenesis pathway because a recycling failure leads to depletion of these proteins from their nucleolar/nuclear sites of action, resulting in pre-rRNA processing delays, assembly defects, and impaired nuclear export of pre-60S particles. All late pre-60S maturation steps investigated to date have been shown to require cofactors (Kre35, Efl1, Sdo1, Rei1, and Drg1) that transiently associate with late pre-60S particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Senger et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Saveanu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hedges et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hung and Johnson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lebreton et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Menne et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pertschy et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zemp and Kutay, 2007</xref>). In addition to these late maturation steps, before achieving translation competence, pre-60S particles must associate with the last few remaining r-proteins. Nearly all the r-proteins associate with pre-rRNAs during early nucleolar biogenesis steps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Grandi et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nissan et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sch&#x000e4;fer et al., 2003</xref>). However, at least three r-proteins, L10, L24, and the acidic r-protein Rpp0, have been suggested to associate at late stages in pre-60S maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zinker and Warner, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kruiswijk et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Saveanu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kressler et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we describe a new late maturation step in the 60S biogenesis pathway. We provide multiple lines of evidence that the release of the nucleolar/nuclear pre-60S factor Mrt4, a ribosomal-like protein that is homologous to the acidic r-protein Rpp0, specifically requires the conserved protein Yvh1 that associates transiently with late pre-60S particles. Our data suggest that this late event permits cytoplasmic incorporation of the r-protein Rpp0, a biogenesis step necessary to construct a translation-competent 60S subunit. An accompanying paper (see Lo et al. in this issue) has reached similar conclusions regarding the role of Yvh1.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The evolutionarily conserved dual-specificity phosphatase Yvh1 was found to coenrich with late cytoplasmic pre-60S particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nissan et al., 2002</xref>). However, its precise role in the biogenesis and nuclear export of pre-60S subunits has remained unclear. In this study, we have used the powerful combination of genetic, cell biological, and biochemical approaches available in budding yeast to gain insights into the requirement of Yvh1 in the 60S pathway.</p><sec><title>Yvh1 is required for proper nuclear export of pre-60S particles</title><p>We initiated our analysis by asking whether Yvh1 has a role in promoting the biogenesis and nuclear export of pre-60S subunits. To this end, we disrupted the endogenous <italic>YVH1</italic> in wild-type diploid cells.

As previously reported, <italic>yvh1&#x00394;</italic> cells exhibited a slow-growth phenotype at all temperatures tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beeser and Cooper, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Muda et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aoki et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sakumoto et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu and Chang, 2009</xref>). Next, whole cell lysates derived from YVH1 and <italic>yvh1&#x00394;</italic> cells were subjected to sucrose gradient centrifugation under polysome-preserving conditions and high salt conditions (800 mM KCl and 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> to dissociate the two subunits; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tollervey et al., 1991</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">1993</xref>). Lysates derived from <italic>yvh1&#x00394;</italic> cells showed the presence of halfmers, but no significant decrease of free 60S subunits was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>). Dissociative high salt sucrose gradient analyses of lysates derived from <italic>yvh1&#x00394;</italic> cells also showed no striking deficit in free 60S versus 40S ribosomal subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>). Halfmer polysomes correspond to a 43S complex, consisting of a 40S ribosomal subunit with attached initiation factors awaiting the addition of a 60S ribosomal subunit while stalled at the start codon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Helser et al., 1981</xref>). The appearance of halfmers can be attributed either to (1) decreased free 60S pool arising from rapid degradation in the nucleus of defectively assembled pre-60S particles, (2) impaired nuclear export of pre-60S particles, or (3) impaired translation initiation. In the first case, halfmers are accompanied with a net decrease in free 60S (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rotenberg et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Deshmukh et al., 1993</xref>), whereas in the other cases, there might be no dramatic decrease in free 60S versus 40S subunits observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baronas-Lowell and Warner, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Eisinger et al., 1997a</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">b</xref>). In the case of <italic>yvh1&#x00394;</italic> cells, there is practically no net deficit in free 60S versus 40S ribosomal subunits, which raised the question of whether the halfmer phenotype was derived from impaired subunit joining (a cytoplasmic event) or impaired nuclear export of pre-60S particles. Localizations of the previously described large subunit (60S) reporter constructs L25-GFP and L11-GFP and S2-GFP for the small subunit (40S; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hurt et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Stage-Zimmermann et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Milkereit et al., 2003</xref>) were investigated. As expected, wild-type cells showed cytoplasmic localizations for both 40S and 60S reporter constructs. In contrast, <italic>yvh1&#x00394;</italic> cells showed nuclear accumulation of both 60S reporters, suggesting an impairment in nuclear export of pre-60S particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>, left; and not depicted; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gadal et al., 2001</xref>).

As previously reported, inactivation of Yvh1 phosphatase activity (Yvh1-C117A) or deletion of the entire N-terminal phosphatase domain (Yvh1-&#x00394;N) did not cause a slow-growth phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beeser and Cooper, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Muda et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sakumoto et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu and Chang, 2009</xref>).

Thus, we investigated which domain of Yvh1 is required for proper nuclear export of pre-60S particles.

Therefore, we conclude that the Zn<sup>2+</sup>-binding domain, and not the phosphatase domain of Yvh1, is required for proper nuclear export of pre-60S particles.

However, the maturation stage on the 60S biogenesis pathway at which Yvh1 joins pre-60S particles was not investigated. To address this, we tagged Yvh1 with GFP at its genomic locus in TAP strains (Ssf1-TAP, Rix1-TAP, Arx1-TAP, and Kre35-TAP) that have been previously used to purify pre-60S particles at different maturation stages, i.e., early to late pre-60S particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yao et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kressler et al., 2008</xref>). Addition of a C-terminal GFP did not alter the growth rates of the TAP strains, suggesting that the Yvh1-GFP fusion is functional (unpublished data). Pre-60S particles at different stages of maturation were isolated from these strains and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Western blotting for the presence of Yvh1-GFP using an anti-GFP antibody. Yvh1 coenriched only with late preribosomal particles (Arx1-TAP and Kre35-TAP) but not with early preribosomes (Ssf1-TAP and Rix1-TAP; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>). We obtained identical results using antibodies raised against recombinant Yvh1-&#x00394;N (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 D</xref>), confirming that the addition of the GFP tag did not alter association with pre-60S particles. Notably, Yvh1 was not found to be associated with mature 60S subunits (Rpl24-TAP; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>). Previously, Yvh1-TAP was detected only in 60S fractions and not in the soluble pool on sucrose density gradient profiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu and Chang, 2009</xref>). To further investigate the nature of the pre-60S particle that associates with Yvh1, we isolated Yvh1-TAP from whole cell lysates and analyzed the preparation on SDS-PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>).

Yvh1-GFP, like the pre-60S export factor Nmd3, is excluded from the vacuole and appears to be localized both in the nucleus and cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 D</xref>). Upon LMB treatment of this strain, nuclear export of pre-60S particles is blocked and thus very rapidly induces nuclear accumulation of the L25-GFP reporter construct and the pre-60S export adaptor Nmd3-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 D</xref> and not depicted; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ho and Johnson, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gadal et al., 2001</xref>). In contrast, nuclear accumulation of Yvh1-GFP was observed in &#x0223c;70% of the cells after 1 h of LMB treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 D</xref>). Similar nuclear accumulation was observed upon the overexpression of the dominant-negative <italic>nmd3-&#x00394;100</italic> allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hedges et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lebreton et al., 2006</xref>; unpublished data).

Previously, a dominant-negative phenotype of a catalytically active domain of the desumoylating enzyme, Ulp1 was rescued by excluding it from the nucleus upon fusion with the exclusively cytoplasmic protein Arc1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Panse et al., 2003</xref>). Thus, to tether Yvh1-&#x00394;N to the cytoplasm, we fused the Zn<sup>2+</sup>-binding domain of Yvh1 (Yvh1-&#x00394;N) to Arc1 (Arc1-Yvh1-&#x00394;N-GFP). First, we assessed whether the Arc1-Yvh1-&#x00394;N-GFP fusion protein, like Yvh1-GFP, was trapped in the nucleus in the Crm1/Xpo1T539C yeast strain upon LMB treatment. We did not observe any nuclear accumulation of this fusion protein in the nucleus even after LMB treatment for &#x0003e;2 h, strongly suggesting that Arc1 was able to very efficiently anchor Yvh1-&#x00394;N in the cytoplasm. Next, we asked whether the Arc1-Yvh1-&#x00394;N-GFP fusion construct could rescue the <italic>yvh1&#x00394;</italic> slow-growth phenotype and pre-60S export defect. This was indeed the case; Arc1-Yvh1-&#x00394;N-GFP rescued the slow-growth phenotype of <italic>yvh1&#x00394;</italic> cells to the same extent as the wild-type Yvh1 at all temperatures tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 E</xref> and not depicted) and rescued the pre-60S export defect (not depicted).

We asked whether Yvh1 functions in the recycling of Tif6 from late cytoplasmic pre-60S particles. Tif6-GFP localization was investigated in YVH1 and <italic>yvh1&#x00394;</italic> cells by fluorescence microscopy. In YVH1 cells, Tif6-GFP at steady state exhibits nucleolar/nucleoplasmic staining as judged by colocalization of Tif6-GFP and the nucleolar marker Gar1-mCherry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>). However, in <italic>yvh1&#x00394;</italic> cells, Tif6-GFP mislocalizes to the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref>) as previously observed in <italic>sdo1&#x00394;</italic> and <italic>efl1&#x00394;</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Senger et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Menne et al., 2007</xref>). Western analysis showed that Tif6-GFP levels in Yvh1 and <italic>yvh1&#x00394;</italic> remain unaltered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 C</xref>). To determine whether Tif6 remained bound to pre-60S subunits in the cytoplasm in <italic>yvh1&#x00394;</italic> cells, whole cell lysates derived from <italic>yvh1&#x00394;</italic> cells were subject to sucrose density gradient analyses. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 D</xref>, Tif6 copeaked with 60S fractions in both YVH1 and <italic>yvh1&#x00394;</italic>, suggesting that Tif6 remains bound to pre-60S particles. These findings raised the possibility that the slow-growth phenotype and 60S export defect observed in <italic>yvh1&#x00394;</italic> cells might be caused by impaired recycling of Tif6. Like the <italic>yvh1&#x00394;</italic> strain, both <italic>efl1&#x00394;</italic> and <italic>sdo1&#x00394;</italic> strains exhibit a slow-growth phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 E</xref>).

However, the question of when Mrt4 joins and leaves the pre-60S particles has not been investigated. To address this, we tagged Mrt4 with GFP in TAP strains (Ssf1-TAP, Rix1-TAP, Arx1-TAP, and Kre35-TAP) that purify early to late pre-60S particles. Addition of a C-terminal GFP did not alter the growth characteristics of the TAP strains, suggesting that Mrt4-GFP fusion is functional (unpublished data). We isolated pre-60S particles from these strains and analyzed the preparations on an SDS-PAGE and by Western blotting for the presence of Mrt4-GFP using anti-GFP antibody. Mrt4 coenriched only with early and nuclear preribosomal particles on Ssf1-TAP, Rix1-TAP, and is found in low amounts on the pre-60S isolated from Arx1-TAP. Mrt4-GFP is completely absent on an exclusively cytoplasmic pre-60S particle (Kre35-TAP; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 B</xref>). Next, we isolated Mrt4-TAP and analyzed the preparation by SDS-PAGE. The identity of coenriching proteins was determined by mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 C</xref>).

To better characterize the Mrt4-TAP purification in relation to other TAP-tagged bait proteins (Ssf1, Rix1, Arx1, and Kre35), which are well-described markers for different (early to late) pre-60S particles, we performed Western analysis using antibodies against several pre-60S marker proteins to further distinguish between nucleolar, late nucleolar/early nucleoplasmic, and late nucleoplasmic pre-60S particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kressler et al., 2008</xref>).

Importantly, protein levels of Mrt4-GFP in Yvh1 and <italic>yvh1&#x00394;</italic> remain unaltered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 B</xref>). Next, we investigated whether the cytoplasmic Mrt4-GFP still remained bound to late pre-60S particles in <italic>yvh1&#x00394;</italic> cells. We purified Rix1-TAP and Kre35-TAP from <italic>yvh1&#x00394;</italic> cells that expressed Mrt4-GFP. In wild-type cells, Mrt4-GFP was found maximally enriched in the Rix1-TAP and absent in the Kre35-TAP purification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 C</xref>). However, in <italic>yvh1&#x00394;</italic> cells, a marked decrease in the amount of Mrt4-GFP in Rix1-TAP accompanied with an increase in the Kre35-TAP particle was seen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 C</xref>). Is the mislocalization of Mrt4-GFP observed in <italic>yvh1&#x00394;</italic> cells specific? The localization of several nucleolar pre-60S factors (Nsa3, Nop7, and Ytm1) was not affected in <italic>yvh1&#x00394;</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 A</xref> and not depicted). Previous studies have shown that the pre-60S factors Nog1 and Arx1 travel to the cytoplasm and that the exclusively cytoplasmic localized proteins AAA-ATPase Drg1 and Rei1 were required for their release from pre-60S (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hung and Johnson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lebreton et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pertschy et al., 2007</xref>). In <italic>yvh1&#x00394;</italic> cells, Nog1-GFP localization remained completely unaltered. However, Arx1-GFP showed a nucleolar staining as opposed to the nucleoplasmic/cytoplasmic staining seen in wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 A</xref>). Thus, Yvh1 is not required for the recycling of Nog1 and Arx1 back to the nucleus. All of these data strongly suggest that Yvh1 is required for the release of Mrt4 from late pre-60S particles.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><p><bold><italic>mrt4&#x00394;</italic> and <italic>yvh1&#x00394;</italic> cells show similar phenotypes.</bold> (A) Wild-type (WT), <italic>mrt4&#x00394;</italic>, and <italic>yvh1&#x00394;</italic> cells were spotted in serial 10-fold dilutions onto YPD plates and incubated at 25, 30, or 37&#x000b0;C for 3 d.

A plausible explanation could be that these gain of function alleles of Mrt4 were efficiently released from pre-60S particles independent of Yvh1 and recycled back to the nucleolus to carry out an important yet unknown nucleolar/nucleoplasmic function. To test this, we created C-terminal GFP fusions of wild type and all dominant alleles of Mrt4 and analyzed their growth characteristics after transformation into <italic>yvh1&#x00394;</italic> and <italic>yvh1&#x00394;mrt4&#x00394;</italic> strains. Wild-type Mrt4-GFP did not rescue the <italic>yvh1&#x00394;</italic> and <italic>yvh1&#x00394;mrt4&#x00394;</italic> slow-growth phenotypes. However, all of the GFP-tagged dominant alleles of Mrt4 rescued the slow-growth phenotype of both <italic>yvh1&#x00394;</italic> and <italic>yvh1&#x00394;mrt4&#x00394;</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9 A</xref> and not depicted).

Interestingly, all of the dominant alleles localized to the nucleolus at steady state in the <italic>yvh1&#x00394;mrt4&#x00394;</italic> strain. Thus, the dominant gain of function alleles of Mrt4 completely bypassed the requirement of Yvh1 for their cytoplasmic release.

These factors associate with preribosomal particles at distinct stages and participate in specific yet unknown maturation events. Upon accomplishing their task, these maturation factors are released and recycled to participate in the next round of maturation. Little is known regarding the mechanisms or the cofactors that are required for the release of trans-acting factors from pre-60S particles at distinct maturation steps. In this study, we provide several lines of evidence that Yvh1 is specifically required for the release of the nucleolar trans-acting factor Mrt4 from pre-60S particles. First, we show that Mrt4-GFP, which at steady state localizes to the nucleolus, is mislocalized to the cytoplasm in <italic>yvh1&#x00394;</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 A</xref>). Notably, nucleolar/nuclear trans-acting factors such as Nog1 and Arx1 that travel to the cytoplasm were not mislocalized to the cytoplasm in <italic>yvh1&#x00394;</italic> cells. Additionally, localization of several other tested nucleolar factors involved in pre-60S biogenesis remained unaltered. Thus, the mislocalization of Mrt4 to the cytoplasm in <italic>yvh1&#x00394;</italic> cells is specific. The reason why Arx1 shows a more nucleolar localization in <italic>yvh1&#x00394;</italic> cells remains unclear and needs further investigation. Second, biochemical analyses revealed that Mrt4-GFP failed to be released from late pre-60S particles in <italic>yvh1&#x00394;</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 C</xref>). This release step appears to be an extremely efficient process because Kre35-TAP does not coenrich Mrt4-GFP in wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Fig. 8 C</xref>). Third, via an unbiased genetic screen, we identified a dominant gain of function allele of Mrt4 that rescued the slow-growth phenotype and pre-60S export defect of <italic>yvh1&#x00394;</italic> cells. Interestingly, a very similar mutation in Mrt4 (MRT4-G68D) was reported to rescue the slow-growth phenotype of <italic>yvh1&#x00394;</italic> cells (Nugroho, S., N. Sakumoto, and S. Harashima. 2003. International Conference on Yeast Genetics and Molecular Biology. Abstr. 10-42). However, the nature of this genetic interaction was not further examined. Curiously, the dominant mutation in Mrt4 (MRT4-G68E) maps into a conserved 25S rRNA&#x02013;binding patch. These mutations are predicted to lower the affinity of Mrt4 for pre-60S particles. Consistent with this, we observed that other mutations introduced into conserved residues, which are predicted to make contact with 25S rRNA, also rescued <italic>yvh1&#x00394;</italic>-associated phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4</xref>). Finally, these dominant alleles were able to recycle without the requirement of Yvh1 and relocalize to their site of action, the nucleolus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9 B</xref>). Altogether, these data strongly suggest that the late-associating pre-60S factor Yvh1 is specifically required for release of Mrt4 from pre-60S particles.</p><p>In which cellular compartment does the release of Mrt4 occur? Yvh1 was previously shown to coenrich with late cytoplasmic pre-60S particles. Yvh1 is present in low amounts in Arx1-TAP and maximally enriched in Kre35-TAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 D</xref>). Interestingly, Yvh1 does not coenrich with mature 60S subunits (Rpl24-TAP), suggesting that Yvh1 visits late pre-60S particles during a short time window to perform its role in Mrt4 release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>). Our cell biological data suggest that Yvh1 is a shuttling protein because Yvh1-GFP accumulated in the nucleus after nuclear export of pre-60S was impaired either by LMB treatment or overexpression of the dominant-negative <italic>nmd3-&#x00394;100</italic> allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 D</xref> and not depicted). We found that a nonshuttling, exclusively cytoplasmically tethered Yvh1-&#x00394;N can rescue the <italic>yvh1&#x00394;</italic> slow-growth phenotype, suggesting that Yvh1 can also perform its role in the cytoplasm. In the accompanying paper, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Lo et al. (2009)</xref> show that a nuclear enriched Yvh1 can rescue <italic>yvh1&#x00394;</italic>-associated phenotypes. These data suggest that the release of the nucleolar pre-60S factor Mrt4 might occur in both nuclear and cytoplasm compartments.</p><p>When is the acidic r-protein Rpp0 incorporated into pre-60S particles? Nearly all 60S r-proteins are incorporated during early nucleolar pre-60S biogenesis steps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nissan et al., 2002</xref>). However, few r-proteins are incorporated at late stages of maturation of the pre-60S particles (L10, L24, and the acidic ribosomal P-protein Rpp0; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zinker and Warner, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kruiswijk et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Saveanu et al., 2003</xref>). As previously observed, we find that Rpp0 coenriches only with late cytoplasmic pre-60S particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kressler et al., 2008</xref>). Moreover, Mrt4 and Rpp0 mutually exclude each other on pre-60S particles because Mrt4-TAP did not coenrich Rpp0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 D</xref>). Thus, the incorporation of Rpp0 requires the prior removal of Mrt4 from pre-60S particles. Because the release of Mrt4 from pre-60S particles requires a late-associating pre-60S factor, Yvh1, the incorporation of Rpp0 into pre-60S particles is likely to be a late cytoplasmic event on the 60S maturation pathway. This is in line with the observation made by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Lo et al. (2009)</xref> that Rpp0-GFP does not accumulate in the nucleus upon impairment of 60S export.</p><p>How is Mrt4 released from late pre-60S particles? We asked whether the release of Mrt4 from pre-60S in <italic>yvh1&#x00394;</italic> might be promoted by providing increased amounts of Rpp0. However, overexpression of Rpp0 did not rescue <italic>yvh1&#x00394;</italic>-associated phenotypes in the 60S biogenesis pathway (unpublished data). Yvh1 is a dual-specificity phosphatase. Unexpectedly, the C-terminal Zn<sup>2+</sup>-binding domain, not the phosphatase activity, was found to be necessary for proper pre-60S export (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>). Next, we speculated that upon binding the pre-60S, Yvh1might induce a conformational change in the pre-60S particle that reduces its affinity for Mrt4. However, Mrt4-GFP was not released from pre-60S particles upon the addition of yeast lysates supplemented with energy (GTP and ATP) and/or recombinant Zn<sup>2+</sup>-binding domain of Yvh1 (unpublished data). It is possible that this release might involve additional components that might not efficiently purify with late pre-60S particles. Determining the precise mechanism by which the Zn<sup>2+</sup>-binding domain of Yvh1 stimulates the release of Mrt4 from late pre-60S particles remains a challenge for the future.</p><p>In conclusion, this study has uncovered a late maturation step in the 60S biogenesis pathway. Notably, DUSP12, the human homologue of Yvh1, can rescue the <italic>yvh1&#x00394;</italic> slow-growth phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Muda et al., 1999</xref>). Thus, the role of Yvh1 in late maturation of pre-60S particles might be conserved from yeast to humans.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Yeast strains and yeast genetic methods</title><p>The <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strains used in this study are listed in Table S1.

The chase was initiated by diluting 200 &#x000b5;l aliquots of the pulse-labeled cells in 1.8 ml of SD medium containing 1 mg/ml uracil. The cells were harvested after 0, 3, 6, and 10 min of chase, washed with ice-cold water, and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was extracted by the hot phenol method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schmitt et al., 1990</xref>) and loaded on a 1.2% agarose formaldehyde gel or on an 8% acrylamide 7 M urea gel. RNA was transfered to a nylon membrane (Hybond-N<sup>+</sup>; GE Healthcare) by capillary blotting and subsequently UV cross-linked to the membrane (Stratalinker 1800; Agilent Technologies). Membranes were sprayed with EN3HANCE (PerkinElmer) and exposed to x-ray films for 3&#x02013;5 d at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C with an intensifying screen.</p></sec><sec><title>Online supplemental material</title><p>Table S1 lists all yeast strains, Table S2 lists all plasmids, and Table S3 lists all oligonucleotides used in this study.
