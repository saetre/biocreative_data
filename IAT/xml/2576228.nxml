Genetic deletion of TGF-&#x003b2;2 in mice strongly impaired both GABA/glycinergic and glutamatergic synaptic transmission in the pre-B&#x000f6;tzinger complex area, while numbers and morphology of central synapses of knock-out animals were indistinguishable from their wild-type littermates at embryonic day 18.5.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The results demonstrate that TGF-&#x003b2;2 influences synaptic function, rather than synaptogenesis, specifically at central synapses. The functional alterations in the respiratory center of the brain are probably the underlying cause of the perinatal death of the TGF-&#x003b2;2 knock-out mice.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Proper synapse formation represents the basis for the regulation of vital functions and motor activity as well as for higher brain functions such as perception, learning, memory and cognition. Factors that influence the morphological development of synapses and that are capable of acutely modulating synaptic activity include neurotrophins such as nerve growth factor or the brain-derived neurotrophic factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Other extracellular signaling factors, such as Wnt-proteins and members of the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-&#x003b2;) family of proteins, are regarded as target-derived signals in synaptogenesis of the invertebrate neuromuscular junction (NMJ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. TGF-&#x003b2;s comprise a large superfamily of proteins with various functions in development and differentiation of the organism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. They signal through type I and II serine/threonine-kinase receptors (T&#x003b2;RI and T&#x003b2;RII) and the downstream signaling involves either smad-dependent or non-smad cascades, such as the ERK, JNK and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The three isoforms of TGF-&#x003b2; proper, TGF-&#x003b2;1, TGF-&#x003b2;2 and TGF-&#x003b2;3, serve functions that range from the control of cell proliferation, cell adhesion, and extracellular matrix production, to differentiation, survival and death of cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Evidence that they are also involved in the development and function of synapses comes from studies in a number of organisms: in chick ciliary ganglionic neurons, target-derived TGF-&#x003b2;1 regulates the developmental expression and translocation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+ </sup>(K<sub>Ca</sub>) channels <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. TGF-&#x003b2;1 also has a prominent role in long-term synaptic facilitation in isolated <italic>Aplysia </italic>sensory ganglia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]: within minutes, TGF-&#x003b2;1 stimulates MAPK-dependent phosphorylation of synapsin, which in turn modulates synapsin distribution, and results in a reduced magnitude of synaptic depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. TGF-&#x003b2;2 modulates synaptic efficacy and plasticity in dissociated rat hippocampal neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>Mouse mutants with a deletion of a single TGF-&#x003b2; isoform have been generated and analyzed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In the case of the TGF-&#x003b2;2 knock-out (KO) mice, the animals exhibit severe developmental deficits and die perinatally. Sanford and co-workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] suggest either pulmonal, cardiovascular or neuromuscular failure as the underlying defect. Despite the fact that the deletion of TGF-&#x003b2;2 results in a phenotype that is comparable with other mouse mutants in which defects in the generation of the NMJ have been identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], the neuromuscular system has not been investigated so far. At the mammalian NMJ, TGF-&#x003b2;2 takes up a special role among the three TGF-&#x003b2; ligands. Even though all three isoforms and their receptors are expressed by motoneurons, muscle and Schwann cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], TGF-&#x003b2;2 is the only isoform differentially regulated during muscle development and finally localized subsynaptically [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. This situation resembles the localization pattern of another TGF-&#x003b2;-superfamily member, the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-7 homologue, glass-bottom-boat (gbb), and its type II receptor, wishful thinking (wit), in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Interestingly, gbb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], wit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], the type I receptors, thickveins (tkv) and saxophone (sax) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], and the smad-homologues, mothers against decapentaplegic (mad) and medea (med) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], have convincingly been shown to regulate the development of the NMJ in fly larvae. The mutation of wit leads to defects in the ultra-structure of the NMJ, to a loss of the number of synaptic endplates and to a reduced frequency of spontaneous neurotransmitter release. Similar observations have been made in flies with mutations in gbb, tkv, sax, and in mad and med.</p><p>Together, increasing evidence suggests that TGF-&#x003b2;2 may be involved in synaptogenesis, modulation of synaptic transmission, synaptic plasticity and especially in shaping the mammalian NMJ. However, a systematic analysis addressing the role of TGF-&#x003b2;2 in synaptogenesis and neuronal network function in mammals <italic>in vivo </italic>is still lacking even though a putative role has been discussed in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Our work is the first example of TGF-&#x003b2;2 acting as an important regulator of central nervous system synaptic function <italic>in vivo </italic>in the pre-B&#x000f6;tzinger-complex (preB&#x000f6;tC), which is part of the respiratory neuronal network in the brainstem. While the peripheral execution of breathing at diaphragm muscle NMJs is intact, TGF-&#x003b2;2 KO mice most likely die from respiratory failure due to impaired neurotransmission within the neuronal network of the preB&#x000f6;tC.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>TGF-&#x003b2;2 KO mice do not display rhythmic respiratory activity</title><p>At embryonic day (E) 18.5, TGF-&#x003b2;2 KO mice (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>) were smaller than wild-type (WT) littermates (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>) and displayed a hunched posture. Following cesarean section, TGF-&#x003b2;2 KO mice were first alive but neither showed voluntary movement nor any respiratory activity as recorded by whole-body plethysmography (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1d</xref>).

Moreover, the NMJ is a well established model for studying synaptogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. We thus studied the development and the function of the NMJs formed between the phrenic nerve and the diaphragm muscle in embryonic WT and KO mice at E18.5.</p><p>To study whether the loss of TGF-&#x003b2;2 leads to changes in the morphology of the NMJ, we first analyzed the branching pattern of the phrenic nerve on the diaphragm to see whether its fasciculation or the branching on the muscle surface were altered. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref> in the lower magnifications, the phrenic nerve split up into three primary branches in KO as in WT mice. At higher magnifications it can be seen that the fasciculation of the phrenic nerve in KO mice was also comparable to WT, that is, bundling into parallel fibers perpendicular to the length of the muscle fibers (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref>). To compare the branching pattern of the motoneuron axons of WT and KO littermates, confocal images of anatomically comparable regions of the diaphragm were taken and analyzed as described by others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].

In WT as in TGF-&#x003b2;2 KO diaphragms, AChR clusters formed (as revealed by &#x003b1;-bungarotoxin-labeling; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b,c</xref>) and were arranged in a central endplate band. We determined the width of the endplate band as described by others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] and found that the average half-maximal width did not differ in WT and KO mice (WT: 132.7 &#x000b1; 18.50 &#x003bc;m, n = 5; KO: 132.4 &#x000b1; 18.22 &#x003bc;m, n = 5, NS, Student's <italic>t</italic>-test). The AChR-clusters were innervated by nerve processes to the same extent in TGF-&#x003b2;2 KO as in WT animals, which is also reflected in the findings that neither the branching pattern of the phrenic nerve nor the half-maximal width of the central endplate band were changed in TGF-&#x003b2;2 KO diaphragms. We also counted AChR clusters per visual field (750 &#x000d7; 750 &#x003bc;m<sup>2</sup>). This revealed a significant loss of about 25% of the clusters in TGF-&#x003b2;2 KO (WT: 185 &#x000b1; 9, n = 6; KO: 140 &#x000b1; 12, n = 6, <italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.05; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2g</xref>). Schwann cells accompany the phrenic nerve and terminal Schwann cells cap the NMJ. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2c</xref> by immunohistochemical staining with S100 antibody, Schwann cells were present in TGF-&#x003b2;2 KO mice as they were in WT littermates.

Taken together, apart from the loss of AChR clusters, the development of NMJs of TGF-&#x003b2;2 KO mice was similar to WT animals.</p><p>In order to investigate whether neuromuscular synaptic dysfunction contributed to the observed lack of breathing, we studied synaptic transmission at NMJs of dissected diaphragm muscles of three TGF-&#x003b2;2 KO E18.5 embryos and five control (four heterozygous and one WT) embryos. Electrical stimulation (1 or 20 Hz) of the phrenic nerve stump resulted in clearly visible contraction of the hemidiaphragm muscle of all embryos tested, demonstrating successful neurotransmission at their NMJs (for video recordings, see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). We measured spontaneously occurring miniature endplate potentials (MEPPs) at TGF-&#x003b2;2 KO NMJs and found no changes in their amplitude (2.16 &#x000b1; 0.16 mV), 0&#x02013;100% rise time (5.25 &#x000b1; 0.69 ms) or frequency (1.47 &#x000b1; 0.19/minute) compared to the controls (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a&#x02013;c</xref> and Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3i</xref>, left panel). Similarly, 0&#x02013;100% rise-time (3.54 &#x000b1; 0.20 ms) and amplitude (31.15 &#x000b1; 4.73 mV) of nerve stimulation-evoked endplate potentials (EPPs) at TGF-&#x003b2;2 KO NMJs were not statistically significantly different from the controls (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3f&#x02013;g,k</xref>), as was the calculated quantal content (14.34 &#x000b1; 1.63; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3h</xref>), that is, the number of transmitter quanta released upon one nerve impulse. Muscle fiber action potentials following from successful neurotransmission showed similar characteristics in TGF-&#x003b2;2 KO and control NMJs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3j</xref>). The delay between stimulation of the nerve stump and the start of the postsynaptic response (either a muscle action potential or an EPP, depending on the actual resting membrane potential of the muscle fiber) was 6.04 &#x000b1; 0.08 ms, which was not different from control (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3e</xref>), indicating a normal action potential velocity at TGF-&#x003b2;2 KO intramuscular motor axons and a normal speed of synaptic transmission. We evoked acetylcholine release by the secretagogue &#x003b1;-latrotoxin.

These currents represented the general activity level of the respiratory network in the preB&#x000f6;tC. We found that both the frequency and amplitude of sPSCs in preB&#x000f6;tC neurons were largely diminished in TGF-&#x003b2;2 KO mice (frequency: -56%; amplitude: -27%; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a&#x02013;c</xref>).

The reductions of the frequencies of mIPSCs could be caused by presynaptic defects. To further confirm this, we evoked mIPSCs by the application of hypertonic extracellular medium containing 300 mM sucrose. This treatment triggers the release of all fusion competent synaptic vesicles, the number of which is a key determinant of the rates of miniature events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].

The present data show that TGF-&#x003b2;2 is an important regulator of proper synapse and neuronal network function within the central nervous system. We conclude this from the fact that its loss resulted in a dramatic decrease of both inhibitory and excitatory synaptic transmission in the respiratory neuronal network of the preB&#x000f6;tC, one of the earliest neuronal networks established. In contrast to this important synaptic role of TGF-&#x003b2;2 in the central nervous system, we show that its loss alters neither synapse morphology nor function at NMJs in the periphery. Therefore, disturbances in the peripheral execution of breathing were excluded as the defect underlying the inability to breathe, and we rather suggest that the perinatal death of TGF-&#x003b2;2 KO mice is due to a malfunction in their central respiratory center.</p><p>At perinatal stages, the brainstem respiratory rhythm-generating network, of which the preB&#x000f6;tC is part, is functionally more mature than other neuronal networks of the brain such as the hippocampus or the cortex. Our data clearly demonstrate that TGF-&#x003b2;2 plays an essential role in the functional maturation of both excitatory and inhibitory synapses within this network. Nevertheless, the widespread distribution of TGF-&#x003b2;2 in the developing and postnatal nervous system and the severity of the impaired synaptic transmission strongly argue for a general role of TGF-&#x003b2;2 in the regulation of synaptic function.</p><sec><title>Synaptogenesis and synaptic function</title><p>The rationale to study TGF-&#x003b2;2-dependent synaptogenesis came from the observation that TGF-&#x003b2;2 KO mice die from congenital cyanosis. As other plausible causes such as cardiovascular or pulmonary failure had already been excluded by others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], we followed the hypothesis that a neuromuscular defect was the cause of death. In that context, two possible scenarios could be envisioned: impaired peripheral innervation due to aberrant morphology or dysfunction of the NMJ; or impaired central regulation of breathing.</p><p>Evidence arising from the analyses of the invertebrate NMJ revealed that the <italic>Drosophila </italic>BMP homologue gbb acts as a retrograde signal in synaptogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] and is thought to provide positional cues to guide synapse development. Mutations of the BMP type II receptor wit show inhibited target-dependent synapse formation in the larva, smaller bouton numbers and defects in neurotransmitter release at the <italic>Drosophila </italic>NMJ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. These results prompted us to analyze the NMJs of TGF-&#x003b2;2 KO embryos, although it should be kept in mind that despite their similar expression pattern at the NMJ, wit is a BMP type II receptor orthologue and gbb also represents a BMP orthologue rather than a TGF-&#x003b2; orthologue, making it a significant surprise if mammalian TGF-&#x003b2; carried invertebrate BMP functions.</p><p>The morphological analyses of NMJs of TGF-&#x003b2;2 KO diaphragms revealed a 25% reduction in the number of NMJs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2g</xref>) while the innervation pattern and NMJ shape remained unaltered (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a&#x02013;f</xref>). The remaining NMJs, however, were not functionally impaired, which can be deduced from the observed muscle contraction after nerve stimulation and the observations that neither spontaneously occurring miniature endplate potentials, nerve stimulation-evoked endplate potentials nor muscle fiber action potentials showed differences when compared to the control group. The reduction of NMJs could be related to a synapse-independent malformation of the diaphragm muscle, which can be observed in TGF-&#x003b2;2 KO diaphragms (see disorganized muscle fibers in TGF-&#x003b2;2 KO diaphragms in the video, which is presented as Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). The reduction of AChR clusters could therefore be a muscle-intrinsic problem, as it is known that TGF-&#x003b2; does affect the differentiation of muscle tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p><p>Analyses of the central regulation of breathing were performed at the level of the respiratory rhythm generating brainstem network. To ensure the most vital function in life, the respiratory network is one of the most robust neuronal networks in the brain, which is able to adapt to most disturbances during life. We show for the first time that both spontaneous and miniature IPSCs and EPSCs were significantly depressed in TGF-&#x003b2;2 KO embryos (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4d&#x02013;i</xref>). This reflects reduced overall network activity (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a&#x02013;c</xref>). It is also quite striking that although the frequencies of both mEPSCs and mIPSCs were severely diminished, the amplitudes of the miniature events were not or only moderately decreased (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4j&#x02013;l</xref>).</p><p>As the overall structure within the brainstem network was not altered (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5d</xref>), the loss in the frequency of sPSCs could be interpreted either as a reduced number of excitatory or inhibitory synapses in the brainstem preB&#x000f6;tC region or as an impairment of the transmitter release machinery in all synapses. When we tested the number of synapses by counting punctae that were positively stained for presynaptic markers, we did not observe a reduction, but rather a tendency towards an increase (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5b</xref>). Also, the western blot analysis of different synaptic proteins yielded no evidence of a lack of synaptic equipment, as almost all proteins tested were again rather increased in their expression levels (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). The amount of postsynaptic neurotransmitter receptor protein, such as NMDAR or GlyR, was not reduced (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>), which argues against a possible lack of postsynaptic sensitivity. Previously, neuroligins have been shown to be required for proper synapse maturation and brain function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. A phenotype closely resembling that of TGF-&#x003b2;2 KO mice was described for the neuroligin 1&#x02013;3 triple KO. Neuroligin 1 is specifically localized to glutamatergic postsynaptic specializations, whereas neuroligin 2 is localized to inhibitory synapses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. However, when analyzing protein levels of synaptic components, neuroligin expression was not reduced in TGF-&#x003b2;2 KO mice, suggesting that TGF-&#x003b2;2 does not determine synapse function via regulation of neuroligins.</p><p>It is possible that the system either tries to compensate for non-functional synaptic sites by generating more contacts or that it fails to eliminate redundant or non-functional synapses. In fact, normal synaptic transmission is essential for the elimination of synapses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Thus, our data argue for a defective rather than reduced central synaptogenesis in mutant mice.</p><p>Our data demonstrate that the loss of TGF-&#x003b2;2 diminished both synaptic excitation and inhibition. As both GABA/glycinergic inhibition and glutamatergic excitation are essential for respiratory rhythm generation, the severe changes in synaptic inhibition and excitation most probably explain the lethal phenotype of TGF-&#x003b2;2 KO mice. Interestingly, the lack of TGF-&#x003b2;2 cannot be compensated for by other TGF-&#x003b2; isoforms during the embryonic phase either in excitatory or in inhibitory central synapses. This is highly intriguing as TGF-&#x003b2;2 and TGF-&#x003b2;3 have overlapping expression patterns in the brain as they are both expressed by glial cells and pyramidal neurons of the cortex (layers 2, 3, and 5) and the hippocampus, by magnocellular neurons of septal nuclei and the hypothalamus and all somato- and visceromotor neurons of the brainstem and the spinal cord [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Moreover, the isoforms share &#x0003e;97% homology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] but seemingly cannot fulfill the same function in this context.</p></sec><sec><title>TGF-&#x003b2; isoform specificity</title><p>As mentioned before, our results demonstrating the requirement for TGF-&#x003b2;2 for central neuronal network function are not only highly surprising with regard to the regulation of synapse function but also from a growth factor point of view. TGF-&#x003b2;s show a widespread distribution and overlapping expression. At least in most <italic>in vitro </italic>experiments TGF-&#x003b2; isoforms are indistinguishable from each other in their biological response. It is therefore highly surprising to see such a unique and dramatic phenotype for TGF-&#x003b2;2 KO mice <italic>in vivo</italic>. Comparison of our findings with the work on BMPs in <italic>Drosophila </italic>shows that apparently TGF-&#x003b2;2 does not have the same function as the BMP-7 homologue gbb, which we first expected from their comparable expression patterns at the NMJ. Another example of distinct functions for BMP-7 and TGF-&#x003b2;2 has been described for their role in the regulation of AMPA and kainate receptors in the human retina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. One should also take into account that the invertebrate NMJ is glutamatergic and does not use acetylcholine as mammalian NMJs do, which might explain why we found alterations in central but not in the peripheral synapses. The obvious difference in the roles of TGF-&#x003b2;2 at central and peripheral synapses might also be explained by a different capacity of the two systems to compensate for the loss of TGF-&#x003b2;2. Future experiments will dissect the evolution of synaptogenesis and regulation of synapse function within the diverging TGF-&#x003b2; superfamily.</p></sec><sec><title>Mechanism of TGF-&#x003b2;2 mediated dysfunction</title><p>Having shown that lack of TGF-&#x003b2;2 led to impaired synaptic transmission, the question arises as to the mechanism by which an extracellular signaling molecule may regulate synaptic function. As both inhibitory and excitatory central synaptic transmission was depressed, TGF-&#x003b2;2 must affect general synaptic functions rather than neurotransmitter-specific aspects. Moreover, the analysis of miniature events and hypertonic sucrose stimulation pointed to a presynaptically localized defect in TGF-&#x003b2;2 KO embryos.</p><p>Evidence from the analysis of isolated <italic>Aplysia </italic>ganglia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] suggested that TGF-&#x003b2; may act via phosphorylation of synapsin in mice and we indeed observed an influence of TGF-&#x003b2; on the phosphorylation of synapsin in hippocampal neurons (unpublished observation). Synapsin phosphorylation is a crucial event for the dissociation of synapsin from synaptic vesicles during normal vesicle cycling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] and the subsequent release of synaptic vesicles from the actin-bound reserve pool into the readily releasable pool of vesicles.

Signals were digitized, stored and analyzed (off-line) on a PC using a Digidata 1322A interface, Clampex 9 and Clampfit 9 programs (Axon Instruments/Molecular Devices) and MiniAnalysis 6 (Synaptosoft, Decatur, GA, USA).</p><p>Intracellular recordings of MEPPs, the spontaneous depolarizing events due to uniquantal acetylcholine release, were made at several different NMJs within the muscle. The phrenic nerve stump was stimulated supramaximally via a suction electrode at 1 and 20 Hz. The resulting muscle contraction of the hemidiaphragm was visually monitored and example contractions were recorded on videotape. Examples of a muscle fiber action potential resulting from a single nerve stimulus were recorded. To be able to record evoked synaptic responses (EPPs), muscle fibers were allowed to depolarize to -20 to -30 mV (which normally occurs quickly after impalement, presumably due to a damaging effect of microelectrode impalement to the relatively thin embryonic muscle fibers). This leads to inactivation of Na<sup>+ </sup>channels, so that a muscle action potential no longer occurs and the underlying EPP could be recorded.</p><p>The amplitudes of EPPs and MEPPs recorded at each NMJ were linearly normalized to -75 mV resting membrane potential. From the grand-mean values of each muscle, the number of acetylcholine quanta released per nerve impulse, that is, the quantal content, was calculated by dividing the mean EPP amplitude by the mean MEPP amplitude.</p><p>MEPPs were also recorded after application of 2.5 nM &#x003b1;-latrotoxin (Alomone Laboratories, Jerusalem, Israel). In these experiments, TTX (1 &#x003bc;M, Sigma-Aldrich, Zwijndrecht, The Netherlands) was added to block muscle action potentials, either occurring spontaneously or triggered by superimposed high frequency MEPPs. All electrophysiological NMJ data are given as group mean values &#x000b1; standard error of the mean with n as number of muscles per group and 3&#x02013;20 NMJs sampled per muscle. Statistical significance was tested with Student's <italic>t</italic>-test.</p></sec><sec><title>Electrophysiological recordings in brainstem slices</title><p>Acute slices containing the preB&#x000f6;tC from embryonic littermate mice (E18.5) were used for whole-cell recordings as described earlier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Briefly, the bath solution in all experiments consisted of 118 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl, 1.5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 25 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 5 mM glucose, pH 7.4, aerated with 95% O<sub>2 </sub>and 5% CO<sub>2 </sub>and kept at 28&#x000b0;C. The pipette solution for patch-clamp-recordings contained 140 mM Kgluconate (glutamatergic PSCs) or 140 mM KCl (GABA/glycinergic PSCs), 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM EGTA, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 4 mM Na<sub>3</sub>ATP, 0.5 mM Na<sub>3</sub>GTP, 10 mM HEPES pH 7.3. Spontaneous GABA/glycinergic and glutamatergic PSCs (sIPSCs and sEPSCs) were recorded from neurons of the preB&#x000f6;tC in the presence of 10 &#x003bc;M CNQX ((6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione) or 1 &#x003bc;M strychnine and 1 &#x003bc;M bicuculline, respectively. Spontaneous mIPSCs and mEPSCs were recorded as described above, but in the presence of 0.5 &#x003bc;M TTX. In order to elicit a hypertonic response (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4p&#x02013;q</xref>), sucrose (300 mM) was directly applied in close proximity to neurons by glass pipettes. To minimize the variation between experiments, tip size of the pipette, pressure (0.5 mbar) and time (500 ms) were kept constant for all experiments. In addition, the distance between pipette tips and the cell were monitored using a LCD camera, and was also kept constant between different experiments. Generally, signals with amplitudes at least two times above the background noise were selected, and the statistical significance was tested in each experiment. In all animals tested, there were no significant differences between the noise levels between different genotypes. All postsynaptic currents recorded were amplified and filtered by a four-pole Bessel filter at a corner frequency of 2 kHz, and digitized at a sampling rate of 5 kHz using the DigiData 1200B interface (Axon Instruments). Data acquisition and analysis were carried out using commercially available software (pClamp 9 and AxoGraph 4.6, Axon Instruments, and Prism 4 Software, GraphPad, La Jolla, CA, USA).</p></sec><sec><title>Immunohistochemistry and light microscopic quantification of synapses of preB&#x000f6;tC neurons</title><p>Embryos (E18.5) were perfused transcardially with 0.5% or 4% PFA. Brains were dissected and post-fixed in the respective fixative for 48 h (0.5% PFA) or 1 h (4% PFA). Following cryoprotection with sucrose, brains were embedded in cryo-medium and frozen on dry ice. Serial frontal sections (14 &#x003bc;m) were collected and Nissl-stained to identify the nucleus ambiguus and subsequent sections were used for immunohistochemistry. After having been blocked with 10% goat serum/0.1% Triton-X, sections were stained for synaptophysin (1:80; Dako), synapsin I+II (1:100; Synaptic Systems, Goettingen, Germany), vGlut2 (1:8,000; Chemicon), and vGat (1:4,000; Chemicon), using the respective secondary antibodies (1:100 goat-anti-mouse-IgG-FITC, 1:100 goat-anti-rabbit-IgG-FITC, both Jackson Immuno Research/Dianova; 1:200 goat-anti-guinea pig-IgG-rhodamin, Chemicon).</p><p>Images were acquired with a confocal laser-scanning microscope (LSM SP2, DM IRE2, Leica) in a blinded manner. Single layer pictures were taken at a magnification of 630&#x000d7; (oil-immersion lens) and 2&#x000d7; digital zoom. The pinhole was set to 120 &#x003bc;m. Gain and offset were kept constant for all specimens of one experiment. For the analysis, images were imported into ImageJ software (NIH, US). To quantify positive punctae, a threshold was manually set for each image prior to binarization and a particle analysis to determine particle number and area.</p></sec><sec><title>Ultra-structural analyses</title><p>For ultra-structural analysis, brainstem sections (200 &#x003bc;m) were prepared from embryonic (E18.5) WT and TGF-&#x003b2;2 KO animals and immersion-fixed with 3.75% acrolein, 2% PFA, 0.1 M MOPS, pH 7.0 for approximately 5 minutes and in 4% PFA, 0.1 M MOPS, pH 7.0 overnight. Subsequently, the tissue was processed according to standard procedures. Briefly, the tissue was osmicated in 1% OsO<sub>4 </sub>and flat-embedded in Spurr's epoxy medium. Ultra-thin sections were cut and stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate before electron microscopic observation with a Zeiss Leo 906E.</p></sec><sec><title>Protein analysis</title><p>Material for western blot analysis was obtained from brainstem tissue of embryonic (E18.5) mice. Brainstems were mechanically homogenized in homogenization buffer (320 mM sucrose, 5 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, 0.1 mM EDTA). The crude lysate was centrifuged (1,000 &#x000d7; g for 10 minutes) to obtain the post-nuclear fraction. Protein concentrations were determined using Biorad's Bradford reagent and equal amounts of protein (20 &#x003bc;g) were dissolved on 10% or 15% acrylamide gels. Proteins were blotted onto nitrocellulose-membranes (Biorad, Munich, Germany). Antibodies against pre- and postsynaptic proteins were used in the following concentrations: 1:10,000 vGlut1 (Chemicon); 1:7,500 vGlut2 (Chemicon); 1:5,000 vGat (Synaptic Systems); 1:500 synaptotagmin (Synaptic Systems); 1:7,500 synaptobrevin (Synaptic Systems); 1:5,000 neuroligin 1, 1:250 neuroligin 2, 1:250 neuroligin 3, 1:5,000 NMDAR (all neuroligin-antibodies and NMDAR-antibody from N. Brose, Goettingen, Germany); 1:500 GlyR (Synaptic Systems). Primary antibodies were detected by the respective horse-radish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson Immuno Research/Dianova) and visualized using the enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) method. Exposed X-ray films were scanned (Epson Twain software with Epson Perfection 1240U-scanner) and the intensity of bands was densitometrically measured using AlphaEaseFC-software (Alpha Innotech Corporation, Kasendorf, Germany). Blots were reprobed for GAPDH and signals of the synaptic proteins were normalized to the GAPDH signal.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis and data illustration</title><p>All experiments were carried out with material from at least three animals per group or from three independent experiments.
