Although a recent gene targeting study indicates that in mice, which have four active non-somatic hyaluronidases, Spam1 is not essential for fertilization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]; this is unlikely to be the case in humans where SPAM1 is the only such hyaluronidase present. In primates SPAM1 has been shown to play a role in three functions during fertilization: (1) hyaluronidase enzyme activity necessary for penetrating the cumulus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] and for which it is best known [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], (2) zona pellucida binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], and (3) Ca<sup>2+ </sup>signaling-associated acrosomal exocytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p>Unlike somatic ubiquitous hyaluronidases that are active only at acidic pH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], SPAM1 has hyaluronidase activity at both neutral and acidic pHs, which arise from two different regions within the hyaluronidase domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. The neutral enzyme activity, which is predominant in insoluble membrane-bound SPAM1, is necessary for sperm to penetrate the hyaluronic acid (HA)-rich extracellular matrix of the cumulus cells surrounding the oocyte. The acidic enzyme activity is present in soluble SPAM1 that is generated during the acrosome reaction (AR), after cleavage at its carboxy terminus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In primate sperm where SPAM1 is a 64-kDa protein, the proteolytically cleaved secretory form that is released after the AR is 53 kDa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Our lab reported a significant increase of Spam1 in caudal mouse sperm compared to caput ones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. This finding led to the discovery that <italic>Spam1 </italic>is also expressed in all three regions of the mouse epididymis: epididymal Spam1 and its transcript were found in both wild-type and sperm-free mutant (germ cell-deficient) mice as well as in cultured epididymal epithelial cells, completely eliminating the possibility that the protein is merely being transported into the epididymis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Expression was shown to be in the principal cells of the epididymal epithelium and to occur preferentially in the distal regions of the tract. Additionally, Zhang and Martin-DeLeon (2001) found evidence that mouse epididymal Spam1 is secreted <italic>in vivo </italic>and <italic>in vitro </italic>and that the gene is differentially regulated in testis and epididymis. Consistent with epididymal expression, putative androgen responsive elements (AREs) were discovered in the murine <italic>Spam1 </italic>5'-flanking region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>Since <italic>SPAM1 </italic>is widely conserved among mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] it is likely that its pattern of expression may also be conserved. Therefore, human SPAM1 might also be expressed in the epididymis, where it could play an important role in sperm maturation. For this reason, it was thought worthwhile to investigate the presence of SPAM1 in the human epididymis and vas deferens for which a possible role in sperm maturation has been proposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Because of the difficulty in obtaining fresh human tissue we included in our study tissues of <italic>cynomolgus </italic>macaque which is a primate model for studying human sperm maturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Procurement of human and macaque tissues</title><p>Human specimens were collected from five (5) individuals of various ages. The first was a surgical specimen from the human proximal corpus epididymis. It was obtained from a 45-year old man (Subject #1) of known fertility who underwent surgical excision of the epididymis because of a large spermatocele (a cystic swelling) at the level of the corpus epididymis. After surgical removal, a portion (about 1 cm in length) of the intact, non-dilated corpus epididymis was placed in PBS for the experiment. It was then washed in PBS, embedded in OCT medium, and stored at -80&#x000b0;C. Eight and 12-&#x003bc;m thick sections were made from the frozen specimen using a Leica Cryostat 3050 S.</p><p>Post-mortem reproductive tissues were obtained from four males. One was a 42-year-old who had died from a myocardial infarction and was not known to have any reproductive problems (Subject #2). The tissues (testis, epididymis, and vas deferens) were obtained through the National Disease Research Interchange (NDRI; Philadelphia, PA) and were either snap frozen in liquid nitrogen or embedded in OCT or paraffin for sectioning. Tissues from Subject #3 and 4, who were 27 and 68 years old, were obtained in the form of slides made from paraffin-embedded sections of testis, epididymis, vas deferens, and seminal vesicles through Novagen (Madison, WI). The tissues were analyzed by a pathologist and found to be morphologically normal and there were no known reproductive problems or medical pathologies that could affect reproductive function. Similarly morphologically normal tissues were used for epididymal sections from a 56 year-old male (Subject #5), and the slides were obtained from the histology core at the University of North Carolina Medical School. None of the subjects were known not to be on hormone therapy prior to death. Macaque (<italic>cynomolgus</italic>) reproductive issues were obtained from Covance (Alice, TX) from two 2 males who were 5 years old and of known fertility. Testis, epididymis, and vas deferens from each animal were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, embedded in OCT or paraffin after standard formaldehyde fixation for sectioning.</p></sec><sec><title>Laser Microdissection (LM)/RT-PCR</title><p>To analyze the mRNA expression of <italic>SPAM1 </italic>in the epididymal epithelium, frozen sections from Subjects #1 and #2 and paraffin-embedded sections from Subject #3 were used. For macaques, frozen sections of the corpus were obtained from Animal #1 and paraffin-embedded sections of the cauda were from the Animal #2. All paraffin-embedded sections were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. The PALM Microbeam system (PALM Microlaser Technologies AG, Bernreid, Germany) was used for laser cutting and separation of selected tissue regions. Immediately prior to microdissection, water was removed from frozen sections by soaking the slides in 100% ethanol for 5 min followed by air-drying for 5 min. Paraffin-embedded sections were treated to remove the paraffin with xylene, prior to the ethanol treatment. Once the tissues were air-dried, the target cells, (epididymal epithelial cells) were carefully laser-microdissected according to the manufacturer's instructions with the cells being collected in mineral oil. The microdissection was performed with care to exclude sperm present in the lumen (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). In addition to microdissection of the epithelial cells, stromal cells were also microdissected from the sections to be used as a negative control (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). LM conditions were as follows: laser focus 67&#x02013;69, laser energy 72&#x02013;76 cut speed 8. These values varied slightly depending on the thickness (8&#x02013;12 &#x003bc;m) of the sections. The total areas of epididymal cells that were microdissected ranged from approximately 350,000 to 450,000 &#x003bc;m<sup>2 </sup>. The samples in mineral oil were kept at -80&#x000b0;C until RNA extraction was performed.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>LM-Mediated Isolation of Epithelial cells from 8 &#x003bc;m thick sections of the human corpus epididymis.

Briefly, cells were lysed in Cell Lysis II Buffer after incubation at 75&#x000b0;C for 10 min. DNase I was added and the lysate incubated at 37&#x000b0;C for 15 min. After inactivation of the DNase at 75&#x000b0;C for 5 min 5 &#x003bc;l of the lysate was used for first strand synthesis under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer. Control experiments were performed simultaneously without the addition of reverse transcriptase (RT). Two microliters of each reverse transcription product was subjected to PCR amplification using a pair of primers (forward: nt 1524&#x02013;1543; reverse 1827&#x02013;1843) designed from the last exon and the 3' UTR of the human <italic>SPAM1 </italic>cDNA sequence (GenBank Accession No. 003117), to yield a product of 320 bp. The identical primer set was used for both humans and macaques. As an added negative control, primers (forward: nt 268&#x02013;285; reverse 360&#x02013;377, yielding a 110 bp product) for the transcript of the human Protamine1 gene, <italic>PRM1 </italic>(GenBank Accession No. NM 002761), which is spermatid-expressed and so should be sperm-specific, were used to attempt to amplify the cDNA from the epithelial cells. Amplification of the 110 bp fragment of this cDNA would indicate contamination of the epididymal cells with sperm. Human genomic DNA was used as a positive control.</p><p>The PCR reactions for <italic>SPAM1 </italic>were performed under the following conditions: 94&#x000b0;C for 2 min: 39 cycles at 94&#x000b0;C for 1 min, 59&#x000b0;C for 2 min, 72&#x000b0;C for 2 min, 72&#x000b0;C for 10 min, and 4&#x000b0;C hold. For <italic>PRM1 </italic>they were 94&#x000b0;C for 2 min, 35 cycles at 94&#x000b0;C for 1 min, 57&#x000b0;C for 2 min, 72&#x000b0;C for 2 min, 72&#x000b0;C for 10 min, and 4&#x000b0;C hold. The PCR products were resolved on 1% agarose gel and stained with ethidium bromide, and the experiments were repeated.</p></sec><sec><title>Sequencing of the RT-PCR product</title><p>The gel-purified PCR products were cloned into either a pSTBlue-1 vector (Novagen, Madison, WI) or pCR 4-TOPO TA vector (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), according to the manufacturer's protocol.

Antisense and sense RNA probes generated from PCR of a 320-bp fragment (nt 1524&#x02013;1843) from the last exon including the 3' UTR of human <italic>SPAM1 </italic>were labeled with digoxigenin-11-UTP (DIG) using an in vitro transcription system [Riboprobe<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>System, (Promega, Cat. No. P1440)] in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol. Tissue sections were fixed for 30 min in 4% paraformaldehyde in DEPC-treated PBS, washed twice for 15 min in PBS containing 0.1% active DEPC, and equilibrated for 15 min in DEPC-treated 5x SSC. Sections were prehybridized for 2 h at 54&#x000b0;C in 500 &#x003bc;l hybridization buffer (50% formamide, 5x SSC, 40 &#x003bc;g/ml salmon sperm DNA) before hybridization with heat denatured RNA probes which had been diluted to 400 ng/ml in hybridization buffer.</p><p>After hybridization, slides were washed for 30 min in 2x SSC at room temperature, 10 min in 2x SSC at 65&#x000b0;C, 10 min in 1x SSC at 65&#x000b0;C and 10 min in 0.1x SSC at 65&#x000b0;C. Slides were equilibrated for 5 min in TBS pH 7.5 (100 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl), and then incubated for 2 h with alkaline phosphate-conjugated anti-digoxigenin antibody (Roche, Cat No. 1093274) diluted 1:5000 in TBS containing 1% BSA. Slides were then washed twice for 15 min in TBS, and equilibrated for 5 min in TBS pH 9.5 (100 mM Tris, 100 mM NaCl, 50 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>). They were then stained in NBT/BCIP solution (Pierce, Cat No. 34042) until a dark purple color was visible (up to 6.5 h). The reaction was stopped simultaneously for both test and control by rinsing with TE buffer (10 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0) for 15 min. Non-specific background was removed by washing in 95% ethanol as needed (20 &#x02013; 40 s) and slides were rinsed in water for 15 min. They were then counter-stained in 1% neutral red, dehydrated in an ethanol series, cleared in xylene, and mounted in permount. Imaging was done using a Zeiss Axioskop and a Kodak MDS digital camera using proprietary interface software and Adobe Photoshop.</p></sec><sec><title>Preparation of protein extracts</title><p>Protein extracts from tissue and sperm were prepared based on the methods of Cherr et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] and Deng et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Epididymis and vas deferens tissues were minced in PBS, shaken, and allowed to gravity settle before the supernatant was carefully removed. This was repeated at least six times or until the washing was sperm-free, by microscopic examination. Supernatant was retained and sperm pelleted from it by centrifugation at 1,000&#x000d7;g for 10 min. Protein extracts were prepared by lysing sperm or homogenized tissues with a solubilization buffer (62.5 mM Tris-HCl, 10% glycerol, 1% SDS, pH 6.8) containing protease inhibitor (1 mM PMSF) at 4&#x000b0;C. The suspension was vortexed and then centrifuged at 10,000&#x000d7;g for 10 min, and the supernatant containing proteins was retained.</p></sec><sec><title>SDS-PAGE and Western blot</title><p>Western blot was performed to detect SPAM1 in protein extracts. An equal mass of each protein sample was subjected to reducing conditions (99&#x000b0;C for 5 min in 100 mM dithiothreitol (DTT)), separated on a 15% SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane according to standard protocols. The protein was detected using a 1:1000 dilution of rabbit polyclonal antibody generated against recombinant macaque SPAM1 (a generous gift from Dr. James Overstreet, UC Davis) and the WesternBreeze Chemiluminescent Western Blot Immunodetection Kit (Invitrogen, Cat No. WB7106) according to the manufacturer's protocol. A Dot blot was also performed to compare the intensities of the protein staining in the different regions of the epididymis and the testis, when equal amounts of protein were loaded. Protein amounts were measured using a BCA assay kit (Pierce, #23227) and spectrophotometry.</p></sec><sec><title>Hyaluronic Acid Substrate Gel Electrophoresis</title><p>Hyaluronidase activities in tissues were measured using HASGE performed as described by Deng et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Briefly, hyaluronic acid from bovine vitreous humor was added to 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gel at a final concentration of 0.15 mg/ml. Gel was run at 15 mAmps constant current until the leading dye band (bromophenol blue) migrated near the bottom. After electrophoresis, gels were incubated at room temperature for 2 h in PBS containing 3% Triton X-100 on a rocking platform to remove SDS. They were then incubated in 100 mM sodium acetate (pH 7.0) at 37&#x000b0;C for 24&#x02013;48 h. To visualize the digestion of the hyaluronic acid, gels were stained with 0.5% Alcian blue in 3% acetic acid for at least 2 h, destained in 7% acetic acid, and then counterstained with Coomassie brilliant blue G-250. Undigested hyaluronic acid is stained with Alcian blue and shows a dark blue background against an unstained area with digested hyaluronic acid. The gels were scanned with a laser densitometer. Images showing the results of the digestion of the hyaluronic acid by hyaluronidase activity present were captured by scanning the gels.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>To confirm the results obtained from the Western analysis and to verify the SPAM1-expressing cell type, immunohistochemistry was performed. Paraffin-embedded slides were dewaxed with three washes in xylene followed by dehydration in ethanol. After dewaxing, some of the human tissue sections were stained with 0.5% toluidine blue for 5 min to quench autofluorescence. Tissue sections were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in 1x PBS (or alternatively methanol) for 30 min and blocked for 60 min in 2% BSA in 1x PBS. In some sections antigen unmasking or retrieval was performed by boiling slides in a microwave for 10 min in 0.01 M citrate buffer, pH 6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Sections were incubated for 1 h at room temperature in rabbit polyclonal antibody against recombinant macaque SPAM1 (diluted 1:500 in the blocking solution), and then washed three times for 5 min each in 1x PBS. Preimmune rabbit serum was used in place of SPAM1 antibody as a control. Sections were then incubated for 30 min at 4&#x000b0;C in fluorescein isothiocynate (FITC)-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (Sigma) diluted 1:500 in blocking solution, and then washed three times for 5 min each in 1x PBS. They were then mounted in p-phenylenediamine antifade (1 mg/ml) with or without propidium iodide (1.5 &#x003bc;g/ml) or DAPI (1.5 &#x003bc;g/ml) and viewed on a Zeiss axiophot fluorescence microscope with images taken with a CCD cooled camera, or with a Zeiss LSM 510 NLO multiphoton confocal microscope using the 488 nm and 647 nm lines of the Ar/Kr laser for FITC.</p></sec><sec><title>In silico analysis of transcription factor binding sites</title><p>The 5' flanking sequence of human <italic>SPAM1 </italic>gene was analyzed using the TESS program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].

The Dot blot which showed that the corpus has the highest level of expression (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>) confirmed this tendency.

Rare <italic>SPAM1 </italic>transcripts are however not ubiquitous as revealed by their absence from human ovary, spleen, and liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] and murine skeletal muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Both rare and abundant <italic>SPAM1 </italic>transcripts have been found in neoplastic breast tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] and in a number of other cancers including pharyngeal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], metastatic melanomas and gliomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. In normal somatic cells rare transcripts have been found in breast tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] and in fetal, placental, and prostate cDNA libraries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>Expression in the prostate is relevant to our findings in the present study where transcripts were detected in the human caput/corpus epididymis using LM/RT-PCR. This technique which has been effectively used to procure homogeneous populations of cells from tissue sections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] revealed that <italic>SPAM1 </italic>mRNA is confined to the epididymal epithelium. <italic>In situ </italic>hybridization demonstrated that the transcript is localized in the principal cells, confirming its epithelial location, similar to that reported for the mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. It must be stressed that because the probes used in the hybridization were generated from the unique 3' UTR of <italic>SPAM1 </italic>cDNA the possibility of cross-hybridization to paralogous hyaluronidases is highly unlikely. This conclusion is supported by unique BLAT assignment of the probe sequence to the human genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p><p>SPAM1 protein was found to be present in both the human and macaque reproductive tracts. This indicates that in the epididymis and vas deferens <italic>SPAM1 </italic>is both transcribed and translated. The results from Western analysis of protein extracts from the epididymis, which like the vas deferens were thoroughly washed to remove sperm, show conclusively that intact SPAM1 protein is synthesized in all three epididymal regions in macaques. It is noteworthy that the ~53 kDa band, representing proteolytically cleaved SPAM1 was seen only in sperm and not in the epididymis or the vas which had their own unique degradation products at ~60 kDa and &#x0003c;50 kDa, respectively. This suggests that the Western results may reveal an isoform that is endogenous to each tissue. It also indicates and that sperm is not the source of epididymal SPAM1. Also in macaque the intensity of the epididymal bands was equal to, or greater than, that of the testis. This also makes it highly unlikely that SPAM1 is present in the epididymis merely because it is transported there from the testis.</p><p>Western blot analysis also suggests that SPAM1 protein is expressed at higher levels in the distal regions of the epididymis, with the highest level of expression in the corpus, a region associated with a lower volume of sperm. This is supported by the Dot blot, with equal protein loading, showing the macaque corpus to have the highest amount of SPAM1. This observation not only argues against the mere transportation of SPAM1 into the epididymis, but also suggests a region-dependent expression of the gene. This finding is consistent with that reported in the mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] where there is differential expression of the protein in the epididymis with the highest expression in the corpus. Expression in the extratesticular pathway seems to be lowest in the vas deferens in both human and macaque. However, its presence prompted us to examine the vas in the mouse where it had not been previously studied: both the transcript and protein were found (Martin-DeLeon et al, unpublished results). Thus there seems to be a conservation of the pattern of expression of SPAM1 in the extratesticular pathways of mice and primates.</p><p>The finding from the Western blots was corroborated by those from immunohistochemistry. The latter indicates that SPAM1 is associated with the principal cells of the epithelium, consistent with the localization of the transcript and with findings in the mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The finding of human SPAM1 in the seminal vesicle, which was examined only because it was included in the tissue series on the slides from Novagen, was unexpected but not surprising. CD52, a well-known human epididymal protein, is also known to be expressed in the seminal vesicle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. While the expression of human SPAM1 in the seminal vesicle remains to be confirmed, data from our lab have shown that the murine <italic>Spam1 </italic>gene is both transcribed and translated in this tissue (Martin-DeLeon, unpublished results).</p><p>HASGE shows that epididymal SPAM1 has neutral hyaluronidase activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>), which is typical only of sperm hyaluronidase. This further supports the identity of the protein expressed in the epididymis. In general, the expression of the enzyme activity was less robust in the epididymis compared to the testis, and inconclusive for the vas deferens. The latter is not surprising because (1) Western analysis showed SPAM1 levels to be the lowest in the vas deferens and (2) it is reasonable to expect that HASGE is less sensitive than Western analysis. More importantly, it is possible that the hyaluronidase activity in cells from non-testicular origin may be lower than that of the testis due to differences in the pattern of glycosylation. Variations in glycosylation patterns have been shown to exist among tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] and glycosylation levels have been reported to influence hyaluronidase activity of SPAM1 in the mouse and horse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Note that in the mouse, tissue differences in glycosylation patterns have been reported for the testis and epididymis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. It is possible that in the epididymis and vas deferens instead of hyaluronidase activity, a more important role of SPAM1 (which is a glycosidase) may be to modify surface proteins of sperm during their maturation. Taken together, the data from tissues of 5 men and 2 macaques show that SPAM1 is both transcribed and translated in the epididymal epithelium of primates.</p><p>The finding of conserved expression patterns of epididymal SPAM1 between humans and mice is supported by the findings in the promoter of the human gene. Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> reveals that in human <italic>SPAM1 </italic>there is a CRE transcription factor binding site, a site that was shown to be functional in the murine <italic>Spam1 </italic>promoter region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] as well as putative AREs which are also present in the mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Of special interest are the relative locations of the AREs which are associated with genes expressed in the epididymis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] and the prostate at -661 and -763; and a CRE (cyclic-AMP responsive element) which is consistent with haploid expression in the testis at -207 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. The relative location of these elements are consistent with the findings of Hsia et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] who observed that within the promoter regions of genes expressed in both the testis and the epididymis, the testis-expression elements are more proximal to the transcription start site than those mediating epididymal expression.</p><p>It should be mentioned that CRE and SRY are likely to be responsible for increasing the basal transcriptional level of <italic>SPAM1</italic>, leading to the robust expression of the mRNA that is detectable with Northern analysis only in the testis. Note that the relevant transcriptional binding factor and/or co-activator for CRE (CREM and ACT) and for SRY in the adult (SRY) are testis-specific [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Future studies are necessary to determine if the transcriptional binding sites revealed by this study are functional in humans.</p><p>In the immunohistochemical studies the sperm concentrations in some of the lumen of the tubules in sections of the caput/corpus epididymis were low enough to allow the observation of SPAM1 localization on immature sperm. Observations of sperm from Subject #1, the 45-year-old male of known fertility with an obstruction in his corpus epididymis, as well as macaques, revealed that SPAM1 is concentrated in the posterior and deficient in the anterior head of immature primate sperm. This localization is quite different from that reported for ejaculated human sperm where SPAM1 is found uniformly over the entire head surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Our finding suggests that SPAM1 undergoes redistribution on the sperm head during epididymal maturation in primates as it does in guinea pigs and mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], albeit with a reverse order going from a regionalized to uniform pattern.</p><p>The finding that SPAM1 with enzymatic activity is expressed in the epididymides of three species (mice, humans and macaques) in two classes of mammals indicates that epididymal SPAM1 is functionally important. It is likely that SPAM1 may play a role in sperm maturation, since its expression is highest in the corpus where a number of maturational changes occur [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Thus, this study increases the biomedical significance of findings regarding Spam1 in the mouse model. For example, it is reasonable to believe that like the mouse, human SPAM1 is secreted from the epididymal epithelium with an intact lipid anchor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] and may impact sperm maturation. It should also be noted that a study of the glycosylation and 2D-gel patterns of Spam1 from the epididymis and testis of mice indicates that epididymal Spam1 may be a unique isoform rather than a redundant protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Such a unique isoform may play a specific role in sperm maturation in humans where SPAM1 is the only reproductive hyaluronidase in the cluster on 7q31. Currently studies are underway to determine the function of epididymal Spam1 in the mouse.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' Contributions</title><p>EAE participated in the design, generated the riboprobes, performed the cryosections, the in situ hybrdizations, and immunohistochemistry, and drafted the manuscript.
