Among them, period 2 is a key component in negative-feedback regulation, showing robust diurnal oscillations. Moreover, period 2 has been found to have a physiological role in the cell cycle or the tumor suppression. The present study reports that 3&#x02032;-untranslated region (UTR)-dependent mRNA decay is involved in the regulation of circadian oscillation of period 2 mRNA. Within the <italic>mper2</italic> 3&#x02032;UTR, both the CU-rich region and polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB) are more responsible for mRNA stability and degradation kinetics than are other factors. Depletion of PTB with RNAi results in <italic>mper2</italic> mRNA stabilization. During the circadian oscillations of <italic>mper2</italic>, cytoplasmic PTB showed a reciprocal expression profile compared with <italic>mper2</italic> mRNA and its peak amplitude was increased when PTB was depleted. This report on the regulation of <italic>mper2</italic> proposes that post-transcriptional mRNA decay mediated by PTB is a fine-tuned regulatory mechanism that includes dampening-down effects during circadian mRNA oscillations.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in the hypothalamus governs circadian clock oscillation in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Circadian oscillations in response to various stimuli have been demonstrated not only at the SCN in the brain but also in various peripheral tissues, and even in cultured cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). These oscillation mechanisms are regulated by a transcriptional negative feedback loop involving binding of the BMAL1/CLOCK heterodimer to the E/E&#x02032; box in the promoter region of clock genes and feedback inhibition by accumulated Per-Cry protein heterodimer, and by post-translational modification of protein products by cellular kinases and degradation by proteasomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Among the core clock gene family, period 2 and period 1 are responsive to photic entrainment from the retina to the SCN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Robust circadian oscillations of <italic>per2</italic> mRNA and Per2 protein are not only evident in the brain, but are also present in various peripheral tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). period 2 is also known to have a physiological role in tumor suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>) and feeding/energy metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). For these reasons, period 2 regulation has been studied more than any other circadian molecule at the translational or post-translational level; however, no reports have demonstrated regulation at the level of mRNA degradation.</p><p>In general, mRNA degradation is controlled by two major components, the mRNA binding motif (<italic>cis</italic>-acting element, CAE) and its binding partners (<italic>trans</italic>-acting factors, TAFs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>); thus mRNAs containing a CAE in their 3&#x02032;-UTR may be regulated by various binding factors. The AU-rich element (ARE) in the 3&#x02032;-UTR is well characterized and is the most commonly used CAE in post-transcriptional regulation. The fate of the mRNA is therefore largely determined by associations between the ARE and its binding factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>).</p><p>The polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB), also known as heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) I, is a cellular RNA-binding protein that is abundant in many tissues. PTB binds to oligopyrimidine tracts in introns and regulates negative or positive exon definition in the differential splicing of various cellular mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14 B15 B16 B17">14&#x02013;17</xref>). More recently, PTB was shown to be involved in other aspects of RNA metabolism, such as modulation of polyadenylation efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>) and the stability of nitric oxide synthase mRNA during inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Moreover, PTB represents the prototype of a heterogeneous group of cellular RNA-binding proteins that are directly involved in the regulation of translation, a function that was discovered during investigation of translation of picornaviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Activated cytoplasmic PTB appears to affect the nutrient-dependent stabilization of mRNAs involved in insulin synthesis and secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). In addition, regulation of protein kinase A by various hormone signaling pathways promotes nucleocytoplasmic relocalization of PTB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>), suggesting a direct role of PTB in the regulation of mRNA stability.</p><p>Circadian rhythms have been studied using transgenic or knock-out animal models to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the control of gene expression at the transcriptional level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25 B26 B27 B28">25&#x02013;28</xref>), whereas transcriptional feedback regulation is considered a representative model for understanding the phenomenum of circadian oscillation, little is known about the role of post-transcriptional regulation in circadian rhythm. Several reports have demonstrated oscillatory mechanisms mediated by post-transcriptional regulation in the fruit fly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>) and recent studies in mammalian systems revealed that regulation of mRNA decay is actively involved in circadian oscillation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). Kojima <italic>et al.</italic> also reported post-transcriptional regulation of the core clock gene PER1; however, this occurred through modulation of the translational process. Regulatory mechanisms acting at many different stages from core clock gene transcription to protein activation allow finely-tuned rhythmic oscillation. With the ongoing addition of new molecular components to the core model, our understanding of the oscillation mechanism is becoming more comprehensive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>).</p><p>The present reports proposes that mRNA stability of the circadian core clock gene <italic>mper2</italic> is modulated by the 3&#x02032;UTR and cytoplasmic PTB, and that mRNA instability is mediated by cytoplasmic increases in PTB protein. Our study also suggests that cytoplasmic PTB-mediated mRNA decay plays an important role in the modulation of peak amplitude or in dampening down the <italic>mper2</italic> mRNA circadian oscillation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plasmid constructions</title><p><italic>mper2</italic> 3&#x02032;-UTRs were amplified from full-length mouse per2 cDNA using specific primers (GenBank accession number NM011066).

The unusual oscillation of the truncated mRNA may be the results of mRNA stabilization. When we tested the oscillation profile of a reporter lacking <italic>per2</italic> promoter the mRNA did not show a natural oscillating profile(data not shown) indicating that transcriptional regulation is required for circadian mRNA oscillation.

Although the contribution of indirectly bound proteins could not be excluded, the direct binding profile of many proteins was examined. One protein of &#x0223c;57 kDa exhibited enhanced binding to the full-length 3&#x02032;-UTR and 3&#x02032;-U449, but not to the 3&#x02032;-end truncated UTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn893/DC1">supplementary Figure S2A</ext-link>).

To identify the interacting protein, we used <italic>in vitro</italic> transcribed biotinylated <italic>mper2</italic> 3&#x02032;-UTR to isolate RNA-bound proteins, which were separated by SDS-PAGE (data not shown). The 57 kDa protein (p57) was analysed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>) yielding a strong match to the polypyimidine tract binding protein (PTB).

Although post-transcriptional regulation of circadian rhythm in Drosophila was reported a decade ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>), its role in the mammalian circadian system has only recently been revealed. Several reports have demonstrated that post-transcriptional regulation is involved in active mRNA decay in pineal gland melatonin biosynthesis and in the oscillation of the core circadian gene <italic>mper3</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). Translational regulation and miRNA involvement were also reported in circadian rhythmicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>). The present study investigates the functional role of mRNA decay in circadian <italic>mper2</italic> gene regulation. <italic>mper2</italic> mRNA decay kinetics were verified using a modified synchronization method, double-dexamethasone shock, in which an additional 100 nM dexamethasone shock was applied 24 h prior to the standard treatment at 0 h. This technique gave reproducible mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>A) and cytoplasmic PTB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A) profiles and the mRNA profile induced by our modified treatment was not significantly different from that reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). Although transcriptional activation and repression of circadian genes is the main regulatory mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>), our results indicate that mRNA stability also plays an important role, and implicate the 3&#x02032;-UTR as a major regulatory element in this process. We have shown that a reporter gene with full length 3&#x02032;-UTR but lacking a circadian promoter did not oscillate, indicating that 3&#x02032;UTR-mediated regulation of mRNA stability is not sufficient to generate circadian oscillation. Although translational repression in <italic>mper1</italic> mRNA oscillation has been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>), this is the first evidence that active mRNA decay plays an important role in maintaining the <italic>mper2</italic> oscillation.</p></sec><sec><title>Circadian mRNA decay is regulated by the 3&#x02032;-UTR and its binding partners</title><p>In general, mRNA decay is mediated by interactions between a specific <italic>cis</italic>-acting element in the mRNA and its binding partners. Sophisticated regulation of gene expression involves various factors acting at the post-transcriptional level, e.g. in splicing regulation, mRNA export, mRNA degradation and surveilence mechanisms such as nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) and nonstop-mediated mRNA decay (NSD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>), in addition to translational regulation. Those regulatory mechanisms involve many kinds of RNA binding protein including hnRNPs and splicing-related proteins, and various non-coding RNAs such as miRNA. We have shown that many RNA binding proteins interact directly or indirectly with <italic>mper2</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>A), suggesting that a single mRNA can have many different binding partners. The combination of binding proteins on a mRNA molecule appears to determine its fate. With respect to the fine regulation of circadian mRNA oscillation, it is important to determine which proteins bind to the mRNA, the function of these proteins, how they interact with each other, and how they trigger changes in target mRNA metabolism. This study investigated the significance of mRNA decay and dampening-down effect in the regulation of circadian oscillation with particular emphasis on the role of cytoplasmic PTB.</p></sec><sec><title>The role of increased level of cytoplasmic PTB</title><p>We showed that PTB can translocate according to the circadian phase to perform cytoplasmic functions such as mRNA degradation. To further elucidate the effects of PTB on mRNA degradation, it is necessary to examine what causes the increase in cytoplasmic PTB levels and the function of PTB in the cytoplasm. Several reports have suggested that PTB increases target mRNA stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>); however, we found that PTB had an opposite effect on mRNA stability. This difference in action of PTB may be the result of complex formation with available RNA binding proteins and generation of stoichiometric change within the mRNA-protein complex. UV cross-linking analysis of mouse SCN nuclear protein revealed changes in the profile of mRNA binding proteins during the circadian period (data not shown), indicating that complex formation between mRNA and its binding partners can change during circadian phases. Considering that nucleocytoplasmic shuttling and a broad range of RNA-binding specificity are general characteristics of members of the hnRNP family, the complex relationships between mRNA and RNA binding proteins such as PTB may influence mRNA stability. We cannot exclude the possibility that other functions of PTB affect circadian rhythm; since PTB has a broad range of binding capacity to mRNA, the increase of peak amplitude caused by depletion of PTB may not be solely caused by inhibition of mRNA decay.</p></sec><sec><title>Circadian oscillation is flexible but enduring</title><p>Our experiments demonstrated robust and reproducible <italic>mper2</italic> mRNA oscillation following synchronization with the modifed dexamethasone treatment. Many reports have demonstrated that certain physiological treatments or gene disruptions affect different aspects of circadian oscillation such as peak amplitude change in mRNA or protein oscillation, phase shift in locomotor activity, or even elimination of oscillation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49 B50 B51">49&#x02013;51</xref>). We found that the oscillation of <italic>mper2</italic> mRNA continued with increased peak amplitude when the <italic>mper2</italic> mRNA binding protein PTB was depleted. Similar results were reported at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels for mRNA regulation of another circadian gene, <italic>aanat</italic> (arylalkylamine <italic>N</italic>-acetyltranferase; serotonin <italic>N</italic>-acetyltransferase). When nocturnal <italic>aanat</italic> transcription was inhibited by ICER (inducible cAMP early repressor), robust oscillation continued with increased peak amplitude and no affect on circadian phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>). In addition, reduction of RNA-binding proteins hnRNP R, Q and L, which have a destabilizing effect on <italic>aanat</italic> mRNA, also resulted in increased mRNA amplitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). As various regulation mechanisms are involved in the modulation of overt circadian gene oscillation, regulatory mechanisms besides PTB-mediated mRNA degradation are probably also involved in circadian <italic>mper2</italic> mRNA oscillation. We previously reported that the 3&#x02032;-UTR binding protein hnRNP Q can bind to an IRES (internal ribosomal entry site) element in the 5&#x02032;-UTR and modulate nocturnal AANAT translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>), showing that a single binding protein can function in various post-transcriptional mechanisms. Our present study demonstrates that PTB has a destabilizing effect on <italic>mper2</italic> mRNA, but we assume that additional, as yet uncharacterized, RNA binding partners also act in a concerted manner to influence the fate of <italic>mper2</italic> mRNA.</p><p>Circadian oscillation may provide buffering capacity against drastic changes in the molecular environment. As circadian oscillation is the result of complicated regulation and interconnected regulatory circuits, the oscillatory pattern may not be readily disrupted. Circadian rhythm is linked to cellular energy metabolism and the cell cycle, therefore an organism will face serious physiological problems if the regulation of circadian rhythm is disturbed. As is the case for many other fundamental physiological phenomena, the complete regulatory mechanism controlling circadian rhythms remains to be revealed.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn893/DC1">Supplementary data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>Korea Science and Engineering Foundation (R01-2006-000-10194-0, R17-2008-027-01000-0); National Core Research Center (R15-2004-033-06001-0); Brain Korea 21 Program of the Korea Ministry of Education.</p><p><italic>Conflict of interest statement</italic>.
