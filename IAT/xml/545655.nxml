We hypothesized that the contact with extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins normally found in bone marrow would promote osteogenic differentiation of hMSC in vitro. To test this hypothesis, we cultured hMSC on purified ECM proteins in the presence or absence of soluble osteogenic supplements, and assayed for the presence of well-established differentiation markers (production of mineralized matrix, osteopontin, osteocalcin, collagen I, and alkaline phosphatase expression) over a 16-day time course. We found that hMSC adhere to ECM proteins with varying affinity (<mml:math id="M1"><mml:mtext>fibronectin</mml:mtext><mml:mo>&#x0003e;</mml:mo><mml:mtext>collagen I</mml:mtext><mml:mo>&#x02265;</mml:mo><mml:mtext>collagen IV</mml:mtext><mml:mo>&#x02265;</mml:mo><mml:mtext>vitronectin</mml:mtext><mml:mo>&#x0003e;</mml:mo><mml:mtext>laminin-1</mml:mtext></mml:math>) and through distinct integrin receptors. Importantly, the greatest osteogenic differentiation occurred in cells plated on vitronectin and collagen I and almost no differentiation took place on fibronectin or uncoated plates.

These cells are related to, but distinct from, stromal stem cells, and are carefully selected for uniform expression of approximately 50 surface antigens (with 98% homogeneity at passage 2), including at least three different stem cell surface marker proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Once isolated and purified from the marrow stroma, uncommitted hMSC retain the capacity to self-renew and differentiate along multiple pathways resulting in the generation and maintenance of an assortment of tissues. This in turn raises the possibility of utilizing these cells to repair or replace damaged tissues. A more complete understanding of the molecular mechanisms driving the differentiation of these cells should significantly facilitate the adoption of these cells in clinical applications.</p><p>What drives the differentiation of hMSC is not entirely known. The development of these mesenchymal progenitors along an osteogenic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], chondrogenic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], and adipogenic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] linage occurs primarily under the influence of chemical stimuli (eg, dexamethazone, transforming growth factor <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>3, insulin), which is accompanied by profound changes in morphology, proliferation, gene expression, and molecular signaling events. However, the underlying mechanisms governing mesenchymal stem cell differentiation in vitro and in vivo are not yet completely understood.</p><p>Cellular differentiation is induced by cues in the environment immediately surrounding cells. Many of the soluble cues known to influence hMSC differentiation have been identified. For example, when hMSC are cultured in the presence of ascorbic acid-2-phosphate (AsAP), <italic>&#x003b2;</italic>-glycerophosphate (<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>GP), and the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone (Dex), they adopt an osteoblastic phenotype and secrete and organize an extracellular matrix (ECM) where calcium phosphate is deposited as hydroxyapatite crystals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Induction by this osteogenic supplement (OS) medium triggers a series of molecular events including activation of signal transduction pathways and expression of osteogenic marker genes including collagen I (COL I), osteocalcin, osteopontin, and alkaline phosphatase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. While these media supplements clearly induce osteoblast differentiation under some conditions, they may suppress bone growth in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], which may limit their usefulness for repairing bone in situ. Response to these agents is biphasic, concentration-dependent, and varies with the length of exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The result is a somewhat heterogeneous population of cells with mixed differentiation potential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. There is a clear need to better understand the molecular mechanisms that control osteogenesis in these cells.</p><p>Insoluble cues that affect cellular differentiation arise largely from cellular binding to ECM proteins. While considerable attention has been paid to the role of OS medium in hMSC differentiation, comparatively little is known about the effect of ECM binding hMSC behavior. However, it is well known that ECM proteins play a major role in bone development. For example, during endochondral bone development, collagen II expression peaks during the chondrogenesis period while COL I deposition is maximal during the ossification phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Furthermore, it has been known for decades that single-point mutations in COL I yield a lethal form of osteogenesis imperfecta (eg, Pace et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]). In other studies, genetic knockouts of collagen II in mice result in severe developmental abnormalities and skeletal defects, especially in cartilaginous elements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. In vitro, bone marrow stromal cells undergo osteogenic differentiation when cultured on COL I matrix, and this requires interaction with the COL-I-binding integrin <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>2<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The mechanisms linking ECM binding to osteogenic differentiation, especially in hMSC, are largely unknown.</p><p>ECM proteins typically affect cell behavior by binding to specific integrin cell surface receptors, which activate intracellular signaling pathways and control gene expression, cytoskeletal organization, and cell morphology. Over 20 different integrin receptors have been identified, which bind to well over 20 different ECM proteins and stimulate at least six different classes of intracellular signaling molecules: protein tyrosine kinases, serine/threonine kinases, lipid kinases, lipid phosphatases, protein phosphatases, and intracellular ion fluxes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The contribution of integrin-associated pathways to osteogenic differentiation of hMSC is largely unknown. Recent evidence implicates ERK 1/2, an integrin- and growth factor-associated signaling protein, as playing a critical role in osteogenic differentiation of hMSC in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The role of ECM proteins in controlling ERK 1/2 activity and other signaling molecules during osteogenesis has not been investigated.</p><p>How hMSC translate adhesion to ECM into cell differentiation is entirely unknown. We hypothesized that adhesion to ECM proteins, in the absence of soluble osteogenic stimulants, would enhance the osteogenic differentiation of hMSC. To test this hypothesis, we cultured hMSC on purified ECM proteins for 16 days in the presence or absence of soluble osteogenic supplements and assessed the differentiation of these cells by a variety of markers. Our results demonstrate that contact with COL I or vitronectin alone may be sufficient to induce differentiation in these cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title><p>Purified bovine COL I, human plasma vitronectin, and human plasma fibronectin proteins were purchased from Chemicon International (Temecula, Calif).

The lack of rapid adhesion to laminin-1 may be explained by the reported absence of the laminin receptor <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>3<italic>&#x003b2;</italic> 1 integrin in preosteoblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. The hMSC do attach specifically to laminin-1, but only after two hours (not shown). Gronthos et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] have demonstrated that stromal stem cells proliferate on all ECM proteins we tested, including laminin-1, using a 14-day colony-forming assay. We have observed that plating hMSC on purified ECM proteins, including laminin-1, supports growth for at least 16 days. It is therefore likely that all ECM proteins we tested play a role in some stage of osteogenesis.</p><p>Some differences between our results and those for stromal stem cells and osteoblasts are noteworthy. For example, we find little role for fibronectin in stimulating osteogenic differentiation, beyond activation of AP activity (not shown). However, Damsky and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] have demonstrated a role for fibronectin during calvarial osteoblast differentiation in vitro. Yu et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] identified increased fibronectin expression during the chondrogenesis phase of bone formation in vivo. Fibronectin expression varies significantly during the time course of mesenchymal condensation, chondrogenesis, and bone formation, and is expressed as splice variants. It is therefore possible that the window of differentiation we have observed with hMSC represents a stage largely independent of fibronectin's effects. Alternatively, the requirement for fibronectin may be tissue specific, such that calvarial osteoblasts require fibronectin while bone-marrow-derived stem cells do not.</p><p>COL I has been reported to induce calcification of stromal cell matrix after 3 weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] while we find that both VN and COL I support the greatest increase in mineral to matrix ratio, calcium deposition, and osteopontin/osteocalcin secretion. These increases are observed in both control media and OS-containing media; as expected, the effects are significantly increased in OS media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>), suggesting that contact with ECM alone induces differentiation but also enhances the sensitivity to OS media. The differentiation we observe in hMSC occurs within 16 days rather than 21 days, as reported for stromal cells. These results may be explained by the fact that stromal cells and hMSC, while being clearly similar, are isolated using different stem cell markers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. From the combined results from both cell types we conclude that multiple ECM proteins may provide a suitable substrate for the attachment of hMSC to the underlying matrix, but that signaling through the COL I receptor <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>1<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>1 integrin and the VN receptor <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>V<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>3 integrin plays the most significant role in promoting osteogenesis. Incubation of preosteoblasts with a function-blocking antibody against the integrin <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>1 subunit inhibits matrix mineralization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], further implicating <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>1<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>1 as a significant player in this process.</p><p>The hMSC have been reported to undergo a morphological transition from an elongated, spindle shape to a cuboidal shape during OS-induced differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Our results support this observation, and based on our examination of the microtubule and actin cytoskeleton, we conclude that OS components induce dramatic remodeling of the entire cytoskeletal network. A drop in parallel microtubule bundles and actin stress fibers in OS-treated cells, accompanied by extensive infolding of the plasma membrane, suggests that cells are transitioning from a tightly adhesive to a more loosely adherent phenotype. The total surface area in control and OS-treated cells did not differ significantly (not shown), so cell spreading appears to be not directly affected. But the absence of focal complexes or focal adhesions in these OS-induced projections suggests that they are not filopodia or lamellopodia, and that OS-treated cells are not motile. Interestingly, however, we found that cells plated on VN or COL I in control medium lacked these projections and yet underwent the initial stages of ossification, suggesting that hMSC may retain some migration ability in the early phases of differentiation. This raises an additional concern regarding the use of OS components for in vivo application of hMSC. In particular, this could have important implications for tissue engineering of bone, where proper organization of osteoblasts in implants is essential, and may require stem cell migration following polymer seeding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Our results suggest that OS components may not be necessary for proper differentiation of hMSC in engineered bone.</p><p>Our differentiation data suggest that adhesion to purified VN, in addition to COL I, is a potent inducer of hMSC osteogenesis. However, it is certain that osteogenesis requires contact with COL I. This in turn suggests that VN and COL I may act cooperatively during differentiation. While the <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>v<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>3 integrin binds to RGD sites in COL I, these sites are cryptic and are only exposed after proteolytic processing of native COL I [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. The <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>v<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>3 integrin also binds to the RGD sequence in osteopontin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], and thus may participate in later stages of differentiation, following osteopontin expression. We find expression of COL I in VN cultures at days 12 and 16 (not shown). The presence of both VN and COL I in the &#x0201c;VN&#x0201d; samples, especially at later time points, may engage multiple integrin receptors simultaneously and thereby activate a host of signaling pathways, which in turn leads to enhanced matrix mineralization. Thus, our data suggest a model wherein contact with COL I stimulates hMSC expression of osteogenic genes directly, while contact with VN may stimulate expression of COL I; both <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>1<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>1 and <italic>&#x003b1;</italic>v<italic>&#x003b2;</italic>3 integrins contribute to osteogenic differentiation via distinct mechanisms.</p><p>Exactly how ECM contact influences expression of osteogeneic genes is not known. However, considerable data implicates a role for the transcription factor Runx2/ CBFA-1 in controlling osteogenic gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Activation of this transcription factor occurs via serine phosphorylation by extracellular regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK 1/2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], which is a target of both growth factor receptors and integrin signaling pathways. Thus integrin-ECM contact may initiate a signaling cascade through ERK 1/2 that leads to activation of Runx2/CBFA-1. The exact makeup of this signaling pathway has yet to be determined, but multiple studies have linked integrin binding to ERK 1/2 activation in other cell types. The results of this study suggest that at least two distinct ECM proteins, and their corresponding integrin receptors, stimulate osteogenic differentiation without soluble OS factors, and strongly suggest that integrin signaling pathways directly control hMSC differentiation.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group
