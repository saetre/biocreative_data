Since no treatment exists for this chronic disease, novel therapies such post-transcriptional RNA interference-based gene silencing are under investigation, in particular those that might enable constitutive and tissue-specific silencing, such as expressed hairpins. Given that this method of silencing can be abolished by the presence of nucleotide mismatches against the target RNA, we sought to identify expressed RNA hairpins selective for silencing the mutant <italic>ataxin-7</italic> transcript using a linked SNP. By targeting both short and full-length tagged <italic>ataxin-7</italic> sequences, we show that mutation-specific selectivity can be obtained with single nucleotide mismatches to the wild-type RNA target incorporated 3&#x02032; to the centre of the active strand of short hairpin RNAs. The activity of the most effective short hairpin RNA incorporating the nucleotide mismatch at position 16 was further studied in a heterozygous <italic>ataxin-7</italic> disease model, demonstrating significantly reduced levels of toxic mutant ataxin-7 protein with decreased mutant protein aggregation and retention of normal wild-type protein in a non-aggregated diffuse cellular distribution. Allele-specific mutant ataxin7 silencing was also obtained with the use of primary microRNA mimics, the most highly effective construct also harbouring the single nucleotide mismatch at position 16, corroborating our earlier findings. Our data provide understanding of RNA interference guide strand anatomy optimised for the allele-specific silencing of a polyglutamine mutation linked SNP and give a basis for the use of allele-specific RNA interference as a viable therapeutic approach for spinocerebellar ataxia 7.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Spinocerebellar ataxia 7 (SCA7) is a late onset neurodegenerative disease which presents with a classic autosomal dominant ataxia but which is uniquely associated with macular degeneration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007232-Martin1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

While important, these studies have targeted suppression of the human disease transgene in the mouse and therefore have not investigated the effects of concomitant wild-type allele suppression or investigated the mechanistic basis for specific suppression of polyQ disease alleles.</p><p>The sequence-specific nature of post-transcriptional RNAi has therapeutic potential where selective inhibition of a mutant transcript would leave the wild-type intact for normal cellular function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007232-Abdelgany1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007232-Miller1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. This can be achieved by exploiting an endogenous single base pair difference between the wild-type and mutant transcripts, such that an effective RNAi sequence can be designed with complete homology to the mutant transcript but containing a single nucleotide mismatch with respect to the wild-type. Effective double-stranded RNAi sequences, whether small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) or derived from expression of hairpin RNAs (shRNAs), undergo strand selection to generate an active single-stranded guide sequence incorporated into the RISC complex. This 19&#x02013;24 nucleotide guide strand comprises functional domains, including the seed region nucleotides 2&#x02013;8 for target recognition and central nucleotides 10 and 11 for Ago2-mediated cleavage. An important question therefore is which guide strand positions are least tolerant of the presence of a destabilising nucleotide mismatch and therefore how guide strand anatomy can be optimised for mutation-specific silencing</p><p>Previous studies have shown degrees of target discrimination with the single nucleotide mismatch incorporated at central guide strand positions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007232-Elbashir1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007232-Haley1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>.

Furthermore, this study showed that purine:purine nucleotide mismatches resulted in maximum selectivity, whereas purine:pyrimidine and in particular the weak G:U mismatch (in which a single hydrogen bond is formed between the two nucleotides) yielded significantly less discrimination, a finding suggested in earlier studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007232-Ding1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007232-Miller2">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>.

Nucleotide mismatches incorporated at shRNA positions 11-16 all showed effective discrimination between the wild-type and mutant targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007232-g002">Figure 2A</xref>), shR-P15 demonstrating the greatest discrimination with the wild-type target minimally affected retaining 90&#x00025; expression and the mutant knocked down to nearly 50&#x00025; relative to a non-specific shRNA control (p&#x0003c;0.05). However, overall target knockdown was less efficient than for shR-P12 (wild-type and mutant targets knocked down to 40&#x00025; and 20&#x00025; respectively) and shR-P14 (wild-type and mutant targets knocked down to 45&#x00025; and 20&#x00025; respectively).

More importantly, these results further support the original observation that, not only does expression of both mutant and wild-type protein result in a significantly increased percentage of aggregates containing wild-type protein (p&#x0003c;0.05), but that treatment with shR-P16 promotes restoration of the wild-type protein expression pattern.</p><fig id="pone-0007232-g005" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0007232.g005</object-id><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Investigation of aggregate formation.</title><p>(A) Representative confocal images of cells transfected with (i, ii) mutant (atx7-100-A-DsRED) alone; (iii, iv) wild-type (atx7-10-G-eGFP) alone.

In this study we have systematically studied RNAi hairpin design and how hairpin guide strand anatomy might be optimised for discriminating single nucleotide mismatches in the <italic>atxn7</italic> gene. Exploiting a CAG mutation-linked SNP we investigated allele-specific silencing of short and full-length <italic>atxn7</italic> target sequences in both hemizygous and heterozygous model systems, the latter mimicking aspects of this dominant neurodegenerative disease. While analysis of short <italic>atxn7</italic> targets revealed that RNAi hairpins incorporating nucleotide mismatches 3&#x02032; to the central region were most selective for mutant <italic>atxn7</italic> silencing, this approach was not predictive of the most efficacious hairpin for full-length target silencing. The hemizygous and heterozygous full-length <italic>atxn7</italic> model systems both revealed the importance of hairpins with the nucleotide mismatch predicted to be incorporated at the 3&#x02032; position 16, and in the heterozygous system this shRNA yielded over 90&#x00025; mutant silencing. Moreover, treatment with shR-P16 led to phenotype correction in a cellular SCA7 model. The accuracy of the position 16 mismatch was corroborated by subsequent analysis in which a pri-miRNA based on miR-122 containing position 16 nucleotide mismatches also generated highly efficient allele-specific <italic>atxn7</italic> silencing.</p><p>The use of short mRNA targets fused to luciferase reporters is an efficient strategy to identify optimal siRNA sequences for target silencing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007232-Coldwell1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007232-Ohnishi1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. Schwarz <italic>et al</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007232-Schwarz1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref> utilised this approach extensively to screen siRNAs for the targeted silencing of mutant <italic>Htt</italic> and <italic>SOD1</italic> genes and reported that nucleotide mismatches in the 3&#x02032; region of the siRNA guide strand could allow greater single nucleotide selectivity than those placed centrally, in particular mismatches at position 16. The present study used a similar approach in which a 60 nucleotide <italic>atxn7</italic> target sequence was fused to a luciferase reporter and systematically identified the importance of single nucleotide mismatches placed at specific positions 3&#x02032; to the central position 10, in particular position 15, for efficient mutation-specific silencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007232-g002">Figure 2</xref>). However, the mismatch at position 16 failed to show mutant discrimination with strong silencing of both mutant and wild-type short target sequences. This supports the general findings of Schwarz <italic>et al</italic>. in revealing that the significance of the 3&#x02032; region for single nucleotide discrimination extends to expressed RNAi hairpins, however importantly this data was not predictive of the most efficacious shRNA targeting full-length mutant <italic>atxn7</italic>. That the shR-P15 was most discriminatory for silencing of a short <italic>atxn7</italic> target (and not position 16 as shown by Schwarz <italic>et al.</italic> 2006), could simply be due to sequence context and the nature of the nucleotide mismatch in this case. Despite extensive modifications designed to thermodynamically bias shRNA guide strand selection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007232-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) it is possible that strand selection by RISC may have affected shR-P15 knockdown efficiency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007232-Khvorova1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007232-Schwarz2">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>, however it is unlikely that this would have influenced the <italic>degree</italic> of discrimination.</p><p>In general target knockdown efficiency was diminished from the luciferase assay to the full-length target studies, and shR-P15 which had previously shown the highest level of mutant selectivity against the short target sequence failed to knockdown the full-length mutant target (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007232-g003">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007232-g004">4</xref>). However, in both hemizygous and heterozygous full-length target studies the shR-P16 showed strong mutant selectivity with minimal effect against the wild-type. The case of shR-P15 highlights the importance of screening full length target sequences. While shR-P15 showed good mutant selectivity against a short target sequence it was ineffective against a longer full length sequence, a finding likely to be explained by structural constraints imposed by the longer mRNA sequence, given that full-length mRNA secondary structure can influence the efficiency of RISC-associated cleavage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007232-Shao2">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, the data suggest that screening of short mRNA targets might not be a reliable method for identifying optimal mutation-specific RNAi hairpins (or siRNAs) for <italic>in vivo</italic>/clinical use. To corroborate the shRNA data a second approach utilising a pri-miRNA hairpin sequence was investigated. The miR-122 backbone was selected for these experiments given that it has been demonstrated to yield homogenous guide strand sequences as opposed to the more heterogeneous products from miR-31 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007232-Ely1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. Particular effort was made to replicate the thermodynamic structure of miR-122 and wherever possible similar strength mismatches were maintained. Importantly miR-P16 (designed to place the nucleotide mismatch against the wild-type <italic>atxn7</italic> at the same position as was used in shR-P16) showed the greatest mutant selectivity in both full-length cell-based assays, with very similar mutant discrimination to that seen for the corresponding shRNA, corroborating the earlier data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007232-g006">Figure 6</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0007232.s003">Figure S3</xref>).

While the reduction in mutant aggregates correlated with a reduction in mutant protein expression, the decrease in wild-type aggregates correlated with an increase in the number of cells showing a dispersed pattern of wild-type ATXN7 protein expression. This is important for two reasons. First, some studies suggest that mutant aggregate formation is protective and thus inhibition of aggregate formation may have detrimental effects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007232-Arrasate1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. In the present study the prevention of large aggregate formation occurred together with reduction in the level of toxic mutant protein and thus is very likely to be beneficial. Second, it has been reported that mutant ATXN7 protein recruits the wild-type protein into intracellular aggregates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007232-Zander1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref> and thus pathogenesis in this polyQ disease may include an element of loss-of-function of the wild-type protein contributing to disease progression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007232-Landles1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. As a consequence of the allele-specific knockdown of the mutant <italic>atxn7</italic> gene we observed that while the expression level of wild-type ATXN7 protein was largely unchanged its localisation was restored to a non-aggregated, more uniform cellular distribution. It is likely that the function of the wild-type protein in transcriptional regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007232-Helmlinger1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007232-Palhan1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref> is inhibited by its sequestration into aggregates, and thus reversal of this loss-of-function may contribute to the efficacy of this therapeutic approach. Further studies in animal models and/or patient derived stem cells will be needed to test this hypothesis. While targeted silencing of the mutant allele is the most ideal therapeutic approach, two recent publications targeting the huntingtin protein in a non-allele specific manner demonstrate therapeutic benefits <italic>in vivo</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007232-Boudreau3">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007232-Drouet1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>. This may well be relevant to other polyQ disorders such as SCA7, given the added technical challenge of allele-specific silencing. The critical questions are the level to which the specific wild-type protein is reduced in such a non-allele specific approach and to what extent such loss is likely to be tolerated in patients with a late onset neurodegenerative disease.</p><p>The identification of shRNA- and pri-miRNA-mismatched hairpins with high selectivity for mutant <italic>atxn7</italic> and the finding that mutant selectivity via targeting a weak nucleotide mismatch may have beneficial phenotypic effects through decreasing mutant ATXN7 aggregates and restoring wild-type protein to its native distribution pattern, suggests that selective RNAi hairpins may have therapeutic benefits for many of the currently untreatable polyQ disorders.

Cells were co-transfected in triplicate as described in the heterozygous assay. Non-overlapping frames of live cells from each well were captured on an AxioVision Inc. microscope using the AxioVision 4.6.3 software after 72 hours. The sum of the total number of cells in three frames was calculated using a 40&#x000d7; objective. Cells with aggregates and those with dispersed patterns of expression were counted as a total of the three different frames of live cells. This was performed in triplicate with the mean representing the average number of that biological triplicate. It is noted that previous studies using the tagged vectors had shown that the reporter genes had no effect on the localisation and expression pattern of the ATXN7 protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007232-Zander1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4f"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis utilized two-tailed t-tests, unless otherwise stated.
