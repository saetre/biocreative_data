A knowledge of its molecular properties will help to understand its physiological functions. We have therefore performed a structure-function analysis of the protein to identify the regions involved in DNA-binding and transcriptional activation. Our data suggest that only the zinc fingers are required for high affinity, specific DNA-binding. Transcriptional activation was not affected by deletion of the C-terminal tail of the protein. In contrast, deletion of the N-terminal half, upstream of the zinc fingers, completely abolished transactivation without affecting DNA-binding or nuclear localization. Two transcriptional activation domains were identified in this region. They cooperate to establish full activity. They are rich in negatively-charged amino acids and are therefore may constitute acidic activation domains. Comparative analysis of the amino acid sequences of several zinc finger proteins belonging to the Krox-20 subfamily indicates that they contain acidic regions at similar locations within their N-terminal region, suggesting that the functional organization of these proteins has been conserved during evolution.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00084-0090-a" xlink:role="2487"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00084-0090-b" xlink:role="2487"/></fig><fig id="F3"><graphic xlink:href="nar00084-0091-a" xlink:role="2488"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00084-0088.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2485"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00084-0089.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2486"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00084-0090.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2487"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00084-0091.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2488"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00084-0092.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2489"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00084-0093.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2490"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00084-0094.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2491"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00084-0095.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2492"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
