In Eubacteria and chloroplasts this type of tRNA is restricted to three families: tRNALeu, tRNASer and tRNATyr. tRNALeuand tRNASer also carry a long extra arm in Archaea, Eukarya and all organelles with the exception of animal mitochondria. In contrast, the long extra arm of tRNATyr is far less conserved: it was drastically shortened after the separation of Archaea and Eukarya from Eubacteria, and it is also truncated in animal mitochondria. The high degree of phylo-genetic divergence in the length of tRNA variable arms, which are recognized by both class I and class II aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, makes type 2 tRNA recognition an ideal system with which to study how tRNA discrimination may have evolved in tandem with the evolution of other components of the translation machinery.</p></abstract></article-meta></front></article>
