While heterologous over-expression systems have allowed identification of several of the potential biological roles of this receptor, its precise function remains largely elusive. Studying PC-1 <italic>in vivo</italic> has been a challenging task due to its complexity and low expression levels. To overcome these limitations and facilitate the study of endogenous PC-1, we have inserted HA- or Myc-tag sequences into the <italic>Pkd1</italic> locus by homologous recombination. Here, we show that our approach was successful in generating a fully functional and easily detectable endogenous PC-1. Characterization of PC-1 distribution <italic>in vivo</italic> showed that it is expressed ubiquitously and is developmentally-regulated in most tissues. Furthermore, our novel tool allowed us to investigate the role of PC-1 in brain, where the protein is abundantly expressed. Subcellular localization of PC-1 revealed strong and specific staining in ciliated ependymal and choroid plexus cells. Consistent with this distribution, we observed hydrocephalus formation both in the ubiquitous knock-out embryos and in newborn mice with conditional inactivation of the <italic>Pkd1</italic> gene in the brain. Both choroid plexus and ependymal cilia were morphologically normal in these mice, suggesting a role for PC-1 in ciliary function or signalling in this compartment, rather than in ciliogenesis. We propose that the role of PC-1 in the brain cilia might be to prevent hydrocephalus, a previously unrecognized role for this receptor and one that might have important implications for other genetic or sporadic diseases.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD) is one of the most common monogenic disorders, affecting approximately 1/500&#x02013;1/1000 of the population <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007137-Torres1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. The hallmark of the disease is bilateral renal cyst formation, although ADPKD is a systemic disorder affecting several other organs. In 85&#x00025; of all ADPKD cases, germ line mutations in the <italic>PKD1</italic> gene are responsible for the development of the disease, whereas in the remaining 15&#x00025; of cases, the <italic>PKD2</italic> gene is mutated. <italic>PKD1</italic> and <italic>2</italic> are ubiquitously expressed and the generally accepted explanation for the formation of cysts in only some organs is the &#x0201c;two-hit&#x0201d; model. According to this model, a second somatic mutation affecting the normally inherited allele occurs in the renal and bile duct epithelia, resulting in the loss of function of either <italic>PKD1</italic> or <italic>PKD2</italic> and causing the expansion of clonal cysts.

While the expression of PC-1 in all of these subcellular locations is not surprising for such a large, complex, and highly post-translationally regulated receptor, it should be noted that there is a general consensus that studying the endogenous protein is challenging due to a series of factors including the low specificity of antibodies, low protein expression levels, and the high complexity of the protein. Characterization of the overexpressed protein in transgenic mice has been proposed as a way to gain insight into the protein's normal processing, localization, and function. However, the generation of a cystic phenotype in the transgenic mice models reported to date <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007137-Thivierge1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref> demonstrates that this approach perturbs the physiological dosage/function of PC-1 and thus cannot be employed to study its normal function.</p><p>To overcome these limitations and facilitate the study of PC-1 <italic>in vivo</italic>, we have used targeted homologous recombination to generate an easily detectable epitope-tagged conditional allele of PC-1.

In grouped cilia present in the ependyma, PC-1 was concentrated either at the tip or along the axoneme of the cilia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007137-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). In primary cilia of the choroid plexus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007137-g004">Figure 4D</xref>), PC-1 was clearly present along the ciliary axoneme with spotty staining both in the HA and in the Myc lines, resembling the distribution observed for IFT particles.

In these types of cilia, PC-1 appeared to be present at the base of cilia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0007137-g004">Figure 4E</xref>). These results suggest that PC-1 might exert different functions on different cilia. Alternatively, since the tags are inserted into the C-terminus of PC-1 and we are therefore able to detect all of the cleavage products containing the C-tail, it is also possible that the different cleavage products are distributed differently in the cilia.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title><italic>Pkd-1</italic> Knock-Out Mice Show Signs of Mild Hydrocephalus by E16.5</title><p>Since we found strong ciliary staining both in ependymal and choroid plexus cilia, we wondered whether the absence of Polycystin-1 in these structures would cause an overt phenotype or if PC-1 function in this compartment is redundant and compensated for by other factors, given that a defect at this level was never reported before in <italic>Pkd1</italic> mutant mice.

We have shown that the manipulations required to generate these alleles do not alter the function of PC-1, since both tagged alleles were able to rescue the embryonic lethality caused by inactivation of the <italic>Pkd1</italic> gene, and adult heterozygous mice carrying the tagged-allele (<italic>Pkd1</italic><sup>HA/&#x02212;</sup> or <italic>Pkd1</italic><sup>Myc/&#x02212;</sup>) have an identical incidence of renal, pancreatic, and liver cystic lesions to that observed in heterozygous animals carrying the wild-type allele (<italic>Pkd1</italic><sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup>). In addition, we have performed a series of biochemical studies to compare the tagged versus wild-type alleles and shown that both HA and Myc-PC-1 have an identical pattern of expression, cleavage, association with the NTF, and heterodimerisation with PC-2 as compared to wild-type protein. All of this evidence leads us to conclude that the endogenous tagged Polycystin-1 behaves identically to endogenous wild-type protein. In addition, we have shown that inclusion of either tag allows for much more efficient detection of PC-1, as we were able to visualize the endogenous protein in total lysates in the absence of an immunoprecipitation enrichment step, as well as by immunofluorescence. Furthermore, using this system, we were able to provide conclusive evidence of the interaction between endogenous PC-1 and PC-2. Thus, we expect our model system to enormously facilitate future studies on the biology of PC-1.</p><p>Notably, we have found that PC-1 is developmentally regulated with a dramatic downregulation of its expression in most tissues during the perinatal life, as was reported previously. In particular, expression in the kidneys is dramatically downregulated during a narrow window of time, between days P4 and P10. In addition, we have shown that expression of PC-1 is ubiquitous but found at very low levels in most adult tissues, including the kidney, liver, pancreas, muscle (not shown), heart, and brain. Dissection in the different areas of the brain revealed that PC-1 is expressed in all areas with slightly higher expression in the olfactory bulbs and cerebellum. Surprisingly, the organ showing the highest expression levels in the adult is the lung and we have attributed this to the absence of postnatal downregulation of PC-1 in the lung. Of great interest, a recent study has reported a bronchiectasis defect in ADPKD patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007137-Driscoll1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>, suggesting that PC-1 function in lungs might be essential in humans.</p><p>In this study, we have focused our attention on characterization of PC-1 role in brain, where we were able to track the protein thanks to the novel system developed. This is not a compartment known to be affected in ADPKD, despite the reasonably high expression levels of PC-1. This is not surprising, but rather provides further support to the two-hit hypothesis, which predicts that renal cystogenesis generates as a consequence of loss of the normal copy of the <italic>PKD1</italic> gene. Thus, our data support the notion that loss of function of both copies of the <italic>PKD1</italic> gene are necessary in order for its function to be inactivated. Thus, based on our evidences it appears that either the <italic>PKD1</italic> gene does not undergo second-hits in the ependyma and choroid plexus, or else that its inactivation in a single cell in this compartment does not provide a growth advantage necessary for the phenotype to manifest.</p><p>However, our data also highlight the broad role of the PC-1 receptor in mammalian development, as previously suggested based on the severe phenotype observed in <italic>Pkd1</italic> mutant mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007137-Boulter1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007137-Kim1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, although the brain is not an organ affected in ADPKD, we believe that studying PC-1 function in this compartment will help shedding light on fundamental features of this receptor, including its subcellular distribution and function. In this study we show that PC-1 can be detected in ependyma and Choroid Plexus (CP), where we found a strong and specific staining in all three types of cilia observed in this region of the brain, i.e., multiciliated and monociliated CP cells and multiciliated ependymal cells. We believe that the distribution observed in these cilia is very informative, as PC-1 appears to localize in a slightly different manner in the different type of cilia. In fact, PC-1 is present at the base of the cilium in the kidney and in tight bundles of multiciliated choroid plexus cells, whereas it distributes along the axoneme with an IFT-like appearance in the monociliated CP cells and it shows more diffuse axonemal staining in the multiciliated ependymal cells. These various distributions might represent differences in the functions of PC-1 or else in the speed of intraflagellar transport in the different cilia, with slower movement in the monociliated CP cells and a longer residence time at the base in the renal monocilia and in the tight multiciliated bundles of the CP. Whatever the explanation for these different staining patterns, our data are in agreement with a previous report showing that inactivation of Polaris, an IFT protein, in the Tg737 mouse results in accumulation of PC-1 at the tip of monocilia, consistent with its possible transportation along the axoneme <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007137-Banizs1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, studies in the biflagellate unicellular alga <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic> have shown that the <italic>Pkd2</italic> orthologue fused to GFP is able to move along the axoneme, further suggesting that the Polycystins can indeed be transported via intraflagellar transport along the ciliary axoneme <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007137-Huang1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Finally, we not only showed that PC-1 is localized to ependymal and choroid plexus cilia, we also showed a novel phenotype of <italic>Pkd1</italic> mice consistent with a function for PC-1 in these structures. In fact, we have observed a mild hydrocephalus both in <italic>Pkd1</italic> mutant embryos and in newborn conditional mice carrying a Nestin-Cre transgene. Our data suggest that the brain ventricular system is impaired in the absence of a functional <italic>Pkd1</italic> gene, most likely due to a developmental defect. During the last phases of embryonic development starting at E14.5 in the mouse, the ventricles, appearing as large cavities, start narrowing to become very compact in the newborn mouse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007137-Fliegauf1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. This process appears to be impaired in the <italic>Pkd1</italic> mutant brain at E16.5, with a major defect in the third ventricle and a much milder effect in the lateral ventricles. These data are particularly interesting when placed in the context of ependymal cilia development. In fact, it was prteviously reported that ependymal cilia are not visible in the lateral ventricles of E16.5 brains, while they are already detectable in the third ventricle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007137-Spassky1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>. At later time points during development, ependymal cilia become progressively visible in the lateral ventricles as well. Our data strongly suggest that the hydrocephalus phenotype in <italic>Pkd1</italic> mutant mice originates from the third ventricle, the first compartment to develop ciliated ependyma, and subsequently expands to the lateral ventricles. In agreement with the phenotype observed in ubiquitously mutant embryos, we found that the third ventricle was massively enlarged at P8 in newborn mice carrying conditional inactivation of the <italic>Pkd1</italic> gene in brain. In this case, however, the lateral ventricles were also subsequently enlarged at P10, further suggesting a progressive dilatation of all the ventricles initiating from the third ventricle. Unfortunately, the Nestin-Cre model employed in this study is also known to be active in the kidney <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007137-Town1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007137-Tronche1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. The <italic>Pkd1</italic><sup>Flox/&#x02212;</sup>;Nestin-Cre mice develop massive renal cystogenesis after birth, eventually causing death of the mice due to renal failure by day P12 (not shown), thus preventing us from studying the effect on hydrocephalus at later time points. However, we would predict that the phenotype becomes more severe with time. Future studies using a faithful brain-specific Cre that also targets the ependyma and choroid plexus will be necessary to clarify this aspect.</p><p>Interestingly, we found no major structural ciliary defects in the brains of these mice. This situation is different from all previously reported mice showing hydrocephalus due to a defective ciliary protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007137-Town1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007137-Banizs2">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. These data are in agreement with the previously proposed role of PC-1 in cilia, which was shown to be dispensable for a correct ciliogenesis, but necessary for ciliary function at least in the kidneys <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007137-Nauli1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007137-Nauli2">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, our data showing no massive defects in the apico-basal polarity of the epithelium in the choroid plexus are also in agreement with the model previously proposed for the role of cilia in CSF formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007137-Banizs1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007137-Banizs2">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. Previous studies on the role of Polaris (IFT88) in preventing hydrocephalus showed similar results. In that case, differences in the secretory properties of the choroid plexus cells were shown in addition to defective ependymal cilia motility, demonstrating that defective ciliary beating is not the sole explanation for hydrocephalus due to defective ciliary function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007137-Banizs1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007137-Banizs2">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. These data were further supported by the fact that hydrocephalus in the <italic>Tg737</italic> mouse develops prior to the initiation of ependymal cilia beating (postnatal life) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007137-Banizs1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. Identical conclusions could be drawn from our results.</p><p>The function of cilia in most tissues is still a mystery. However, several studies have proposed a role for cilia in the regulation of different signalling pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0007137-Michaud1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, in the ventricular system of the brain, it is conceivable that cilia might be important signalling platforms to allow precise control and coordinate the rate of secretion, movement, and re-absorption of the CSF. PC-1 is a large receptor able to regulate different signalling pathways. Thus, its function in the brain cilia might be to integrate this information in order to achieve the correct regulation of fluid balance.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Antibodies</title><p>The antibodies (Abs) used in this study were as follows: anti-c-Myc (Roche, 1667203, Cell signalling, 2272), anti-HA (Roche, 1867431), PC-2 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc28331); anti-GAPDH (Cell Signalling Technologies, 2118) (1&#x02236;1000), anti-acetylated-&#x003b1;-tubulin (Sigma, T6793, 1&#x02236;1000).
