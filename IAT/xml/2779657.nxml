Leukocytes from patients with WHIM syndrome display impaired CXCR4 internalization and enhanced chemotaxis in response to its unique ligand SDF-1/CXCL12, which likely contribute to the clinical manifestations. Here, we investigated the biochemical mechanisms underlying CXCR4 deficiency in WHIM syndrome. We report that after ligand activation, WHIM-associated mutant CXCR4 receptors lacking the carboxy-terminal 19 residues internalize and activate Erk 1/2 slower than wild-type (WT) receptors, while utilizing the same trafficking endocytic pathway. Recruitment of &#x003b2;-Arrestin 2, but not &#x003b2;-Arrestin 1, to the active WHIM-mutant receptor is delayed compared to the WT CXCR4 receptor. In addition, while both kinases Grk3 and Grk6 bind to WT CXCR4 and are critical to its trafficking to the lysosomes, Grk6 fails to associate with the WHIM-mutant receptor whereas Grk3 associates normally. Since &#x003b2;-Arrestins and Grks play critical roles in phosphorylation and internalization of agonist-activated G protein-coupled receptors, these results provide a molecular basis for CXCR4 dysfunction in WHIM syndrome.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The G protein-coupled receptor CXCR4 and its chemokine ligand stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1, also termed CXCL12) play essential roles in the development and function of the hematopoietic system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008102-Ma1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008102-Zou1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>.

In brief, upon ligand binding, CXCR4 becomes phosphorylated on several serine and threonine residues in the cytoplasmic carboxy-terminal tail, recruits a &#x003b2;-Arrestin, which leads to clathrin dependent CXCR4 internalization, ubiquitination, and eventual lysosomal degradation. In spite of general agreement on the sequence of events accompanying CXCR4 signaling and degradation, many questions persist on the biochemical features of many of the steps. In the case of WHIM-associated CXCR4 mutants, it is unclear which step or steps are abnormal.

As a consequence of this difference in kinetics, signaling by a cell consisting of both a WT and a mutant receptor at a 1&#x02236;1 ratio would be expected to have a signaling time that would be extended.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008102-g002">Figure 2E</xref>, Erk 1/2 signaling was maximal at 15 minutes in cells expressing the WT receptor, whereas it was only detected at 60 minutes in cells expressing the WHIM receptor. When both WT and WHIM receptors were co-expressed in HEK 293 cells, signaling had a bimodal pattern with a peak at 15 minutes and a second peak at 60 minutes, likely reflective of signaling by the individual receptors. These results support our prediction, and are consistent with the extended signaling observed in patients with WHIM. To confirm that such a bimodal pattern was not unique to HEK 293 cells, we transiently transfected equal amounts of both receptors into HeLa cells. Although the kinetics of signaling were slightly different from those with HEK 293 cells, the bimodal pattern of Erk1/2 signaling was also observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008102-g002">Figure 2E</xref>), providing additional evidence for the presence of prolonged signaling when WT and WHIM receptors are expressed.</p><p>We also compared WT and WHIM CXCR4 in attachment assays.

Five important observations were made. First, the mutant receptor is internalized later than the WT receptor after ligand binding. Second, the mutant and WT receptors use the same protein trafficking pathway marked by Rab 5, 7, and 11. Third, ligand-induced phosphorylation of Erk 1/2 is delayed in cells bearing the mutant receptors. Thus, the presence of both a WT and WHIM mutant allele would be expected to result in prolonged Erk 1/2 activation stemming from the combined effect of WT and mutant receptor. Fourth, &#x003b2;-Arrestin 2 recruitment to the activated mutant receptor is delayed compared to the WT receptor, whereas &#x003b2;-Arrestin 1 is not. Fifth, Grk3 and Grk6 bind to the active WT receptor and both are important for its trafficking. However, Grk6 fails to physically associate with the ligand-activated mutant receptor.</p><p>It was previously noted that activation of the Erk1/2 signaling pathway is altered in primary cells from a WHIM patient carrying a 15-residue C-terminal CXCR4 truncation and in cells transduced with this mutant receptor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008102-Lagane1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>.

However, these earlier studies emphasized the enhanced/prolonged signaling by the mutant receptor and its prolonged association with &#x003b2;-Arrestin 2 in comparison with the WT receptor. Our experiments disclose the absence of physical interaction between Grk6 to the activated mutant receptor, a substantial delay in recruitment of &#x003b2;-Arrestin 2 to the activated mutant receptor, and a delay in receptor internalization, trafficking and Erk1/2 activation induced by the ligand.

However, one important distinction between WHIM patients and Grk6-null mice is that the mice did not show a difference in blood neutrophil levels compared to WT mice, suggesting that Grk6 alone does not control neutrophil release from the bone marrow.

We show that the WT and WHIM receptors can both associate with &#x003b2;-Arrestin 1, and we find no difference in the kinetics of &#x003b2;-Arrestin 1 interaction with WT versus mutant CXCR4 receptors. These results are consistent with the notion that &#x003b2;-Arrestin 1 and &#x003b2;-Arrestin 2 have independent functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008102-Shenoy1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008102-Nobles1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>, but does not exclude the possibility that &#x003b2;-Arrestin 1 may play some indirect role in WHIM-CXCR4 deficiencies.

It is unclear how dimerization may influence the receptor's ability to bind ligand and signal. In the case of WHIM patient cells, where both a WT and mutant form exist, it is possible that extended signaling could result from either individual receptor signaling, or alternatively from a single signaling unit comprising heterodimeric WT and mutant CXCR4. Further work will be required to distinguish between these two possibilities. Regardless of whether the functional receptor unit is a dimer or a monomer, our results clearly show the critical role of Grk6-CXCR4 receptor interaction for proper receptor function.</p><p>Most of our studies were performed in the well-characterized Hela cells, but many of the results were confirmed in neuroblastoma cells and myeloid cells. Nonetheless, it is possible that subtle differences may exist among different cell types depending on receptor and effectors expression levels. In conclusion, we present biochemical evidence for the cause of WHIM disease associated with mutant CXCR4. In addition, our findings provide further insight into the complex interactions that mediate CXCR4 signaling.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cells and Cell Culture</title><p>HeLa and HEK 293 cells (American Type Culture Collection, ATCC) were propagated in Dulbecco's Modified Eagles Medium (DMEM, Gibco) supplemented with 10&#x00025; heat-inactivated Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS, Atlanta Biologicals), glutamine and penicillin/streptomycin (Gibco).
