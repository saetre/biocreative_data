In case of the hepatitis C virus (HCV), a positive-strand RNA virus that in the majority of infections establishes persistence, cyclophilins are considered to play an important role in RNA replication. Subsequent to the observation that cyclosporines, known to sequester cyclophilins by direct binding, profoundly block HCV replication in cultured human hepatoma cells, conflicting results were obtained as to the particular cyclophilin (Cyp) required for viral RNA replication and the underlying possible mode of action. By using a set of cell lines with stable knock-down of CypA or CypB, we demonstrate in the present work that replication of subgenomic HCV replicons of different genotypes is reduced by CypA depletion up to 1,000-fold whereas knock-down of CypB had no effect. Inhibition of replication was rescued by over-expression of wild type CypA, but not by a mutant lacking isomerase activity. Replication of JFH1-derived full length genomes was even more sensitive to CypA depletion as compared to subgenomic replicons and virus production was completely blocked. These results argue that CypA may target an additional viral factor outside of the minimal replicase contributing to RNA amplification and assembly, presumably nonstructural protein 2. By selecting for resistance against the cyclosporine analogue DEBIO-025 that targets CypA in a dose-dependent manner, we identified two mutations (V2440A and V2440L) close to the cleavage site between nonstructural protein 5A and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase in nonstructural protein 5B that slow down cleavage kinetics at this site and reduce CypA dependence of viral replication. Further amino acid substitutions at the same cleavage site accelerating processing increase CypA dependence. Our results thus identify an unexpected correlation between HCV polyprotein processing and CypA dependence of HCV replication.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Owing to limited genetic information, viruses have to exploit host cells to achieve efficient production of virus progeny. Host cell factors and pathways therefore play an important role for virus replication and thus represent a possible target for antiviral therapy. In case of the hepatitis C virus (HCV), an RNA virus infecting liver cells and causing chronic liver disease, host cell cyclophilins were shown to play an important role in replication. Pharmacological inhibition of cyclophilins, which are catalysts of protein folding, causes profound inhibition of HCV replication, but neither the underlying mechanism by which cyclophilins contribute to viral replication, nor the exact nature of the cyclophilin are known. In this study we demonstrate that HCV replication and presumably also virus particle assembly requires cyclophilin A (CypA), which can be blocked by the cyclosporine analogue DEBIO-025. We identify mutations affecting proteolytic cleavage of the viral polyprotein that render HCV replication less dependent on CypA and thus cause DEBIO-025 resistance. Studies with additional mutants reveal a correlation between polyprotein cleavage kinetics and CypA dependence. Our results support a model by which CypA activates the viral replicase in a manner that depends on the kinetics with which the viral polyprotein is cleaved.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="18"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a hepatotropic virus that has a high propensity to establish persistence. At present, more than 170 million people suffer from chronic hepatitis C <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000546-Poynard1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Current therapy of this disease is based on the combination of pegylated interferon-alpha and ribavirin. However, sustained viral response rates are not satisfying and side-effects associated with this therapy are high. Thus, the development of alternative and more effective strategies to counteract HCV infection are of great importance. One promising drug showing potent anti HCV function is cyclosporine A (CsA). The cyclic undecapeptide CsA is a secondary metabolite of the fungus <italic>Tolypocladium inflatum</italic> and was originally discovered as powerful immunosuppressive drug <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000546-Borel1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

Unlike CsA, these molecules binds to CyPs but do not display calcineurin inhibition.</p><p>As a member of the <italic>Flaviviridae</italic> family, HCV has a positive strand RNA genome encoding a single polyprotein that is cleaved by cellular and viral proteases into 10 different proteins (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000546-Bartenschlager1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000546-Moradpour1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>). The structural proteins core, envelope protein 1 (E1) and E2 reside in the N-terminal region of the polyprotein and they are the major constituents of the virus particle.

The latter is composed of two domains, an N-terminal protease domain which is activated via the NS4A cofactor and a C-terminal helicase domain. NS4B most likely plays a major role in the induction of membrane alterations that are required for the assembly of viral replication complexes. NS5A is an RNA binding protein required for replication and virus assembly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000546-Huang1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000546-Appel1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref> and NS5B is the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). Cleavage of the polyprotein in the NS3 to NS5B region is mediated by the NS3/4A protease complex. Processing at the NS3-4A site is a rapid intramolecular reaction. Subsequent cleavages take place intermolecularly in the following preferred, but not obligatory order: NS5A-B, NS4A-B, NS4B-5A <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000546-Bartenschlager2">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000546-Lin1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>.

Cyps are molecular chaperones catalyzing the cis-trans isomerization of proline residues and hence are called peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans-isomerases (PPIases). Up to now 16 Cyp members have been identified with 7 major members found in humans (CypA-E, Cyp40, CypNK; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000546-Wang1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>). Cyps share a common domain, but other than their PPIase activity differ in subcellular distribution and function. Conflicting data exist as to which Cyp is required for HCV replication. Watashi and coworkers reported that CypB is important for viral replication and they observed a direct binding of CypB to NS5B which results in enhanced RNA binding and thus increased RNA polymerase activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000546-Watashi1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>.

Cells were lysed 4, 24, 48 and 72 h after transfection and replication was scored by measuring luciferase activity in cell lysates. Luciferase activity was normalized to the 4 h value, reflecting transfection efficiency. Replication was not affected by CypB knock-down and was comparable between na&#x000ef;ve and vector control-transduced Huh7-Lunet or Huh7.5 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000546-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>, left and right panel, respectively). However, when we transfected the same replicon into cells with the stable CypA knock-down luciferase activity was reduced more than 100-fold at the early time point (24 h post transfection) in case of Huh7-Lunet cells and about 50-fold in case of Huh7.5 cells. Only at the latest time point (72 h post transfection) luciferase activities were comparable in all transfected cell lines. This kinetic is due to the fact that replication of JFH1 is limited by the host cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000546-Binder1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. For this reason RNA replication phenotypes are often only detectable at early time points after transfection before host cell factor(s) (other than CypA) become limiting and thus restrict HCV replication in na&#x000ef;ve cells. Therefore, HCV replication in cells with the CypA knock-down can &#x02018;catch up&#x02019; until it reaches wild type level <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000546-Binder2">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. By using the luciferase values (which because of the very short half life of luciferase are ideally suited to determine replication kinetics) we calculated the apparent doubling time of HCV RNA during the exponential phase in the various cell lines. We found that apparent doubling time in na&#x000ef;ve and control cells were in the range of 3.7 h whereas apparent doubling time was 11.4 h in Huh7-Lunet cells with stable CypA knock-down. In case of Huh7.5-derived cell lines apparent doubling times were 3.6 h and 7.4 h for control and CypA knock-down cells, respectively. Thus results obtained with both cell lines were remarkably similar arguing against a cell line-specific phenotype.</p><fig id="ppat-1000546-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1000546.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Impact of stable CypA or CypB knock-down on RNA replication of genotype 2a and 1b replicons.</title><p>(A) Huh7-Lunet cells (left panel) and Huh7.5 cells (right panel) either stably transduced with the unrelated shRNA control (sh-control) or a vector encoding the CypA- or CypB-specific shRNA or naive cells were transfected with a subgenomic luciferase reporter replicon derived from the HCV isolate JFH1 (sgNS3/JFH1-Luc, shown at the top).

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000546-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>, replication of a highly adapted Con1-derived replicon (Con/ET; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000546-Lohmann1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>) was completely blocked in Lunet cells with CypA knock-down as deduced from the comparable drop of luciferase expression in cells transfected with this replicon or the replication defective NS5B active site mutant (Con/GND). In contrast, replication of Con1/ET was completely unaffected by knock-down of CypB expression. In case of Huh7.5 derived cell lines that support Con1 RNA replication to a much lower extent, we also observed a complete inhibition of replication in CypA knock-down cells, but in some experiments a slight inhibition in cells with a CypB knock-down was found as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000546-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>, right panel). The latter was however, at the limit of statistical significance (Mann-Whitney-Test).</p><p>Finally, we studied whether CypA dependence of HCV replication is specific for this virus or applies to other flaviviruses by analyzing replication of a Dengue virus 2 (New Guinea C isolate) replicon in the same cell lines. We found that RNA replication of Dengue virus was not affected by CypA or CypB knock-down in Huh7-Lunet cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000546.s001">Fig. S1</xref>, left panel) whereas in Huh7.5 cells with a CypA knock-down a slight reduction of replication was found (right panel). However, also in this case this difference was at the limit of statistical significance. In summary, we concluded that CypA is an essential host cell factor required for RNA replication of HCV but not Dengue virus, whereas CypB appears to play no role for HCV replication.</p><p>To study the impact of these knock-downs on replication of full length HCV genomes we used a bicistronic reporter genome (Jc1-Luc; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000546-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>, upper panel).

Means and standard deviations of two independent experiments are shown. The dark shaded region in the HCV genome map in the top indicates the J6-derived sequence; the white region corresponds to JFH1. (B) Huh7-Lunet cells were transfected with the Jc1 genome and accumulation of intracellular core protein amounts was determined by core-specific ELISA (upper panel). Kinetic of core release is shown in the middle panel. Core protein in culture supernatants of transfected cells was normalized to total core protein amounts (intra- plus extracellular core). Kinetic of release of infectious virus particles is shown in the bottom panel. Infectivity was determined by TCID<sub>50</sub> assay. Background of the assay is indicated by the horizontal dashed line. (C) Huh7-Lunet cells were transfected with JFH1-derived subgenomic replicons encoding an NS3 to 5B or NS2 to 5B replicase of JFH1 (sgNS3/JFH1-Luc and sgNS2/JFH1-Luc, respectively) and replication was determined by luciferase assay as described in the legend to panel (A). Background of the assay was determined with the sgNS3-derived replicon with an active site mutation destroying NS5B RdRp activity (&#x00394;GDD). A representative experiment of three independent repetitions, each performed in duplicate is shown.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ppat.1000546.g003"/></fig><p>The profound inhibition of Jc1-Luc replication in CypA knock-down cells might be due to the less robust replication of this bicistronic genome compared with the sgNS3/JFH1-Luc replicon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000546-Koutsoudakis1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. Alternatively, CypA dependence of JFH1 full length HCV genomes and subgenomes may differ. We addressed these possibilities by transfection of CypA knock-down cells with a full length genome lacking heterologous sequences. Owing to highest assembly efficiency we used the Jc1 chimera (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000546-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). Viral replication was scored by determination of intracellular core protein amounts whereas virus production was determined by measurement of core released into the supernatant of transfected cells as well as infectivity titers in culture supernatant (TCID<sub>50</sub>; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">materials and methods</xref>). Replication of the Jc1 genome was potently reduced in CypA knock-down cells, but unaffected by CypB knock-down. In addition to impaired replication, core release was also reduced as deduced from the relative core protein amounts in cell lysate and culture supernatant. In agreement with this profound block of replication and impaired assembly no infectivity was detected in supernatants of CypA knock-down cells even though virus titers in control cells were in the range of 10<sup>5</sup> TCID<sub>50</sub>/ml and higher.</p><p>The congruent results obtained with the genomic reporter replicon and the Jc1 genome suggest that CypA targets an additional viral factor outside of the minimal replicase (NS3 to NS5B). We assumed that NS2 would be the most likely candidate for three reasons. First, cleavage at the NS2-3 site by NS2 is essential for RNA replication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000546-Welbourn1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>; second, the structural proteins core, E1 and E2 as well as p7 are dispensable for RNA replication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000546-Lohmann2">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>; third, NS2 is required for HCV assembly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000546-Jones1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000546-Jirasko1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. To put this assumption to the test we performed comparative transient replication assays by using subgenomic JFH1 replicons encoding either an NS2 to NS5B or NS3 to NS5B replicase (sgNS2/JFH1-Luc and sgNS3/JFH1-Luc, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000546-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>). Replication of the sgNS2 replicon was almost completely blocked in Huh7-Lunet cells with a CypA knock-down and only slightly above background as determined with the replication defective NS5B active site mutant JFH1/&#x00394;GDD. In contrast, replication kinetic of the sgNS2 RNA was well comparable between Huh7-Lunet cells with a CypB knock-down and control cells that had been transduced with a non-targeting luciferase shRNA. We note a lower replication of the sgNS2 replicon in CypB knock-down cells at 24 h post transfection as compared to the sgNS3 replicon, but this reduction was also observed with control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000546-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>). At later time points, replication of sgNS2 and sgNS3 replicons was comparable. In summary these results provide genetic evidence that CypA also targets a factor outside of the replicase, most likely NS2.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Isomerase activity of CypA is essential for HCV RNA replication</title><p>Although the results described so far clearly support an important role of CypA for HCV replication, we could not exclude that the observed phenotype was due, at least in part, to off-target effects.

We therefore utilized a selectable JFH1-derived subgenome that carried a stable in-frame insertion of the red fluorescent protein (RFP) in domain 3 of NS5A <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000546-Schaller1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>, which allowed visualization of replicating HCV via RFP autofluorescence in live cells.

In case of genotype 2a the P5 and P4 residues are serine and valine, respectively. Genotype 2b isolates have in addition a P7 glutamic acid residue and a P3 isoleucine residue. Based on this alignment we constructed two cleavage site mutants corresponding to the NS5A-B site of genotype 2a and (with the exception of the P3 isoleucine) to genotype 2b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000546-g009">Fig. 9A</xref>, lower half). In addition these mutations were combined with the P3 leucine substitution (V2440L) to determine its contribution on DEBIO-025 resistance, CypA dependence and cleavage kinetics in the context of the 2a and 2b cleavage site. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000546-g008">Fig. 8</xref>, cleavage between NS5A and NS5B was enhanced with mutants 2a-5AB and 2b-5AB.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000546-g009">Fig. 9E</xref> all cleavage site mutations increased virus titers and kinetics. With the exception of the 2b-5AB V2440L mutant, peak titers were reached already 24 h post transfection with all mutants and titers were elevated 100- to 1.000-fold. Especially for the 2a-5AB mutant, already 7 h after transfection infectious virus was detected in the culture supernatant (compare 2a-5AB also with the very efficient Jc1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000546-g009">Fig. 9E</xref>). A significant, but less pronounced enhancement of kinetics and overall production of virus was achieved with mutant 2b-5AB.

The data also suggest that cleavage kinetics at the NS5A-B site and virus assembly may be linked.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>Exploitation of host cell machineries to achieve efficient replication is a strategy shared by all viruses. In case of HCV, Cyps have gained increasing interest because of the possibility to interfere pharmacologically with their activity thus providing a new approach for antiviral therapy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000546-Flisiak1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. In the present study we demonstrate that CypA but not CypB is the major player for HCV replication. This conclusion is supported by the profound impairment of replication by stable CypA, but not CypB knock-down and the rescue of viral replication by expression of CypA in these cells. Rescue was not achieved by expression of the active site mutant H126Q. This mutation resides in the hydrophobic pocket of CypA and causes a reduction of PPIase activity to about 1&#x00025; of the wild type <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000546-Liu2">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000546-Zydowsky1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. Although this result argues for a role of PPIase activity in HCV replication, it should be kept in mind that CypA mutants that are impaired in isomerase activity have reduced substrate binding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000546-Zydowsky1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000546-Gamble1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, PPIase activity and substrate binding cannot be separated genetically and therefore, the exact role of isomerase activity in HCV replication remains to be determined.</p><p>Cyps are a diverse group of proteins that share a PPIase activity and a 109 amino acids long Cyp-like domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000546-Wang1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. There are 7 major Cyps in humans that differ in their N- and C-terminal sequences, which determine the intracellular localization of a given Cyp. For instance, CypA (as well as Cyp40 and CypNK) are cytosolic whereas CypB and CypC possess N-terminal signal sequences, which target the proteins to the ER-resident secretory machinery. CypD has a signal sequence recruiting the protein to mitochondria and CypE is localized in the nucleus. Although the role of Cyps in HCV replication has been established in several reports, conflicting results exist as to which individual Cyp is required. Two studies identified CypB, but not CypA, as the key player in HCV replication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000546-Watashi1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000546-Nakagawa1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. One study describes that CypA, B and C are required <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000546-Nakagawa2">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref> and the study by Yang and co-workers suggests that CypA, but not CypB and C is critical for HCV replication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000546-Yang1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. The results presented in this report are in full support of the work by Yang and colleagues. We also identify CypA as the key player in HCV replication and show that this host factor is the target of the cyclosporine analogue DEBIO-025. The reasons for the discrepant results is not known, but may in part be due to the use of different cell systems, HCV isolates or experimental conditions such as utilized siRNAs. However, we note that in our study HCV replication was impaired upon CypA knock-down both in Huh7-Lunet and Huh7.5 cells; two widely used Huh7-derived cell clones that are highly permissive for HCV replication. We also note that the impairment of HCV replication was found both with the JFH1 and the Con1 isolate similar to what Yang and colleagues described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000546-Yang1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. In support of these findings, a very recent study also describes CypA as the main actor in HCV replication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000546-Chatterji1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>. Considering the subcellular localization, the cytosolic CypA is more likely to interact with the HCV replicase that also resides on the cytosolic side of the ER membrane, in contrast to the ER luminal CypB. In addition, CypB and C are expressed 10&#x02013;150-fold lower in hepatoma cells as compared to CyPA thus increasing the likelihood of the latter to interact with the viral replicase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000546-Yang1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In an attempt to study the mode-of-action of CypA, we wanted to exploit the possibility to interfere with this protein pharmacologically by using DEBIO-025, a compound that shows promise in clinical trials for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000546-Flisiak1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. The advantage of this compound is its higher anti-HCV activity as compared to CsA and reduced immunosuppressive activity, the latter being due to reduced calcineurin affinity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000546-Paeshuyse1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000546-Ptak1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>. As shown here, dose-response assays with cell lines expressing various levels of CypA confirm that DEBIO-025 indeed targets this host cell factor: HCV replication can be sensitized to the antiviral activity of DEBIO-025 by stable knock-down of CypA whereas over-expression of CypA leads to partial DEBIO-025 resistance. Although these results confirm CypA as a DEBIO-025 target, it is not known whether other Cyps are also affected by this compound, because interference with these proteins (e.g. CypB) has no effect on HCV replication, which was used as a read-out in our assays.</p><p>By using replicons to select for DEBIO-025 resistance we identified Y1421F (Y391F in NS3) that resides in the NS3 helicase domain, two mutations in domain 2 of NS5A (D2229G/D253G; L2266F/L290F) and one mutation at the P3 cleavage site position of the NS5A-B junction (V2440A/V464A). Among these mutations, only V2440A (V464A in NS5A) reduced DEBIO-025 sensitivity and rendered HCV replication less dependent on CypA. We had recently identified a mutation at the very same site that enhances virus assembly about 100-fold without affecting RNA replication (V2440L/V464L) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000546-Kaul1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. As shown here this mutation also confers DEBIO-025 resistance, renders HCV replication less dependent on CypA and slows down processing at the NS5A-B site. Results obtained with additional mutations at the NS5A-B site revealed a correlation between processing kinetics and CypA dependence (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1000546-t002">Table 2</xref>): mutants with slower cleavage kinetic require lower level of CypA and are less sensitive to DEBIO-025 treatment compared to wild type whereas mutants with accelerated cleavage kinetic are more dependent on CypA and more sensitive to DEBIO-025 treatment.

Proper folding of NS5B may require liberation of the N-terminus from the polyprotein (i.e. cleavage at the NS5A-B site). NS5B folded in the absence of CypA may adopt a conformation that is enzymatically inactive or that is not competent to be incorporated into the replicase complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000546-Liu3">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>. In this model binding of CypA to NS5B would be required to induce a conformation necessary for replicase formation or activity. Binding however, would be possible only during a short time period, i.e. prior to or shortly after release of full length NS5B from the polyprotein. In case of a delayed processing (V2440L/A) the time during which the CypA binding site is accessible is extended and therefore lower amounts of CypA would suffice to bind to NS5B. Nevertheless, also under these circumstances CypA is required for HCV replication thus explaining why these replicons are still susceptible to DEBIO-025, albeit to a lesser extent. In case of hyper-processing the time for CypA binding would be much shorter and therefore the chance for interaction with NS5B would be lower. This can however be compensated by higher CypA amounts. This model would also explain why the mutations modulating NS5A-B processing do not have an effect on RNA replication in na&#x000ef;ve cells. Under normal conditions, CypA levels are not limiting and even in case of the hyper-processing mutants CypA amounts are sufficient to bind to NS5B. Only when CypA levels are reduced either by knock-down of CypA expression or by DEBIO-025 treatment the chance that CypA can bind to NS5B during the much shorter time period, compared to wild type, becomes apparent. In contrast, delaying processing will extend the time for CypA binding and therefore even lower CypA amounts would be sufficient for binding to NS5B. However, a too slow processing at the NS5A-B site appears to impair replicase activity as deduced from the reduced replication of the V2440A mutant.</p><p>The CsA resistance mutations residing in domain 2 of NS5A that have been described in a recent study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000546-Fernandes1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref> may affect NS5B activity indirectly by altering binding of NS5A to NS5B.

This observation suggests that CypA may have an additional target outside of the minimal replicase. The most likely candidate is NS2, because it contributes indirectly to RNA replication and is required for assembly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000546-Jones1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000546-Jirasko1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref> whereas all other proteins residing in the N-terminal domain of the polyprotein (core, E1, E2, p7) are completely dispensable for RNA replication. In fact, the stronger inhibition observed with the JFH1 sgNS2-replicon containing NS2 and the impairment of HCV assembly supports this assumption. Since NS2 contributes to RNA replication indirectly by cleaving off itself from NS3, a possible explanation is that CypA supports proper folding of NS2. However, in addition to a viral factor CypA may also be required for host cell factor(s) contributing to virus production. In fact, preliminary results suggest that CypA may be required for integrity of lipid droplets (A. Kaul, C. Berger, and R. Bartenschlager, unpublished observation), which play a key role in HCV assembly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000546-Boulant1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000546-Shavinskaya1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>.
