The primary defense against <italic>Chlamydia</italic> infection in the mouse involves the IFN&#x003b3;-inducible family of IRG proteins; however, the precise mechanisms mediating the pathogen's elimination are unknown. In this study, we identify Irga6 as an important resistance factor against <italic>C. trachomatis</italic>, but not <italic>C. muridarum</italic>, infection in IFN&#x003b3;-stimulated mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). We show that Irga6, Irgd, Irgm2 and Irgm3 accumulate at bacterial inclusions in MEFs upon stimulation with IFN&#x003b3;, whereas Irgb6 colocalized in the presence or absence of the cytokine. This accumulation triggers a rerouting of bacterial inclusions to autophagosomes that subsequently fuse to lysosomes for elimination. Autophagy-deficient Atg5&#x02212;/&#x02212; MEFs and lysosomal acidification impaired cells surrender to infection. Irgm2, Irgm3 and Irgd still localize to inclusions in IFN&#x003b3;-induced Atg5&#x02212;/&#x02212; cells, but Irga6 localization is disrupted indicating its pivotal role in pathogen resistance. Irga6-deficient (Irga6&#x02212;/&#x02212;) MEFs, in which chlamydial growth is enhanced, do not respond to IFN&#x003b3; even though Irgb6, Irgd, Irgm2 and Irgm3 still localize to inclusions. Taken together, we identify Irga6 as a necessary factor in conferring host resistance by remodelling a classically nonfusogenic intracellular pathogen to stimulate fusion with autophagosomes, thereby rerouting the intruder to the lysosomal compartment for destruction.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Chlamydiae are obligate intracellular pathogens that cause a variety of infections in humans and animals. <italic>Chlamydia trachomatis</italic> is a primarily human pathogen associated with common sexually transmitted diseases and trachoma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004588-Carlson1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

IFN&#x003b3; also induced accumulation of the autophagosomal membrane marker LC3, and the lysosomal component LAMP1, suggesting a rerouting of <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> phagosomes to autolysosomes. However, autophagy-deficient MEFs (Atg5&#x02212;/&#x02212;) and WT cells with an impairment in lysosomal acidification surrendered to infection. While Irgb6, Irgd, Irgm2 and Irgm3 still localized to chlamydial inclusions in IFN&#x003b3;-induced Atg5&#x02212;/&#x02212; cells, Irga6 localization was disrupted, indicating a pivotal role for Irga6 in resistance to the microbe. Strikingly, Irga6-deficient MEFs (Irga6&#x02212;/&#x02212;), in which chlamydial growth is enhanced compared to WT MEFs, showed no response to IFN&#x003b3; even though all the major IRG proteins studied still localized to inclusions. Thus, Irga6 constitutes a critical resistance factor against <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> infection in IFN&#x003b3;-induced MEFs that remodels a classically non-fusogenic intracellular pathogen vacuole, stimulating fusion with autophagosomes and directing the intruder to the lysosomal compartment for destruction.</p><p>Autophagy reroutes cytoplasmic material and organelles internalized into autophagosomes to lysosomes, culminating in the formation of autolysosomes and degradation of their cargo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004588-Kabeya1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004588-Levine1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004588-Yoshimori1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>.

Despite the presence of IFN&#x003b3;, autophagosome-deficient MEFs were highly permissive to <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> replication in a compartment disconnected from lysosomes, confirming an involvement of autophagy that leads to lysosomal degradation of the bacteria. Similarly, a study in macrophages showed that IFN&#x003b3; stimulates recruitment of LC3 and LAMP1 to the <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> compartment and induces autophagy to inhibit bacterial viability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004588-Gutierrez1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>.

This discrepancy can be explained by the fact that our LAMP1 analysis was done at 3 h p.i., a time at which most <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> early inclusions strongly colocalized with LAMP1.

Additionally, <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> inclusions in Irga6&#x02212;/&#x02212; cells do not colocalize with LAMP1 and LC3, confirming an involvement of autophagy in restricting pathogen growth.

When overexpressed in cells not stimulated with IFN&#x003b3;, Irga6 and Irgb6 intracellularly mislocalized and aggregated.

Nelson and co-workers suggested a gene in the plasticity zone of <italic>C. muridarum</italic>, which is absent in <italic>C. trachomatis</italic>, is responsible for avoiding the Irga6-mediated growth inhibition by <italic>C. muridarum</italic> in murine cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004588-Nelson1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. This gene encodes a relatively large protein with a homology to a clostridial toxin and the <italic>Yersinia</italic> YopT virulence factor. YopT acts as cysteine protease that can inactivate Rho GTPase by the cleavage of the GTPase and its subsequent release from the membrane. Although indirect, the authors suggested that a <italic>C. muridarum</italic> hypothetical large toxin inactivates Irga6 by a similar mechanism. In contrast to our work, a recent study demonstrated the transient overexpression of Irgb10 in the absence of IFN&#x003b3; was sufficient to reduce the yield of <italic>C. trachomatis</italic>, but not <italic>C. muridarum</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004588-Coers1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. Overexpressed Irgb10 was found associated with <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> inclusions only. Based on this differential subcellular localization of Irgb10 in infected cells, the authors proposed Irgb10 is recruited to the inclusion to induce bacterial growth blockage. They also suggested that <italic>C. muridarum</italic> is protected from IFN&#x003b3;-induced immune response by a mechanism that restricts access of Irgb10 to its inclusion. Here we show IFN&#x003b3;-stimulated association of different IRG proteins (Irga6, Irgb6, Irgd, Irgm2 and Irgm3) with inclusions harbouring <italic>C. trachomatis</italic>, but not <italic>C. muridarum</italic>. Importantly, Irga6 was found to be the critical effector protein responsible for immune resistance to <italic>C. trachomatis</italic>, while other IRGs could have cooperative interactions. Cells deficient in Irga6 were highly permissive to <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> infection, although other IRGs were recruited in response to IFN&#x003b3;. However, <italic>C. muridarum</italic> inclusions did not associate with any of these IRGs. These results strongly indicate that <italic>C. muridarum</italic> can prevent, by a yet undefined mechanism, not only the access and/or the activity of the effector Irga6, but also the localization of the so called &#x02018;co-operative&#x02019; IRGs required for the anti-bacterial function of Irga6.</p><p>Our data indicate that modification of the inclusion is critical to the outcome of the host-parasite interaction; the presence of Irga6 on the inclusion membrane defeats the complex array of processes by which <italic>C. trachomatis</italic> seeks to delay phagosomal maturation.
