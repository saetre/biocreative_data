LKB1 is a multi-task Ser/Thr kinase that phosphorylates AMPK controlling cell growth and apoptosis under metabolic stress conditions.

However, the connection between the RAS pathway and LKB1 is mostly unknown.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>Using the UV induced HGF transgenic mouse melanoma model to investigate the interplay among HGF signaling, RAS pathway and PI3K pathway in melanoma, we identified LKB1 as a protein directly modified by HGF induced signaling. A variety of molecular techniques and tissue culture revealed that LKB1<sup>Ser428</sup> (Ser431 in the mouse) is constitutively phosphorylated in BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> mutant melanoma cell lines and spontaneous mouse tumors with high RAS pathway activity. Interestingly, BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> mutant melanoma cells showed a very limited response to metabolic stress mediated by the LKB1-AMPK-mTOR pathway. Here we show for the first time that RAS pathway activation including BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> mutation promotes the uncoupling of AMPK from LKB1 by a mechanism that appears to be independent of LKB1<sup>Ser428</sup> phosphorylation. Notably, the inhibition of the RAS pathway in BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> mutant melanoma cells recovered the complex formation and rescued the LKB1-AMPK&#x003b1; metabolic stress-induced response, increasing apoptosis in cooperation with the pro-apoptotic proteins Bad and Bim, and the down-regulation of Mcl-1.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>These data demonstrate that growth factor treatment and in particular oncogenic BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> induces the uncoupling of LKB1-AMPK&#x003b1; complexes providing at the same time a possible mechanism in cell proliferation that engages cell growth and cell division in response to mitogenic stimuli and resistance to low energy conditions in tumor cells.

LKB1 is the AMPK&#x003b1; upstream kinase that becomes phosphorylated in response to metabolic stress controlling protein synthesis through mTOR pathway. Considering the LKB1<sup>Ser428</sup> phosphorylation as a read out of the RAS and LKB1 pathways interaction, the constitutive phosphorylation of LKB1<sup>Ser428</sup> in BRAF mutant cells suggested a possible interplay between LKB1-AMPK pathway and BRAF oncogenic signaling. Therefore, we investigated the LKB1-AMPK pathway activation in three different BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> mutant melanoma cell lines under low energy conditions and the contribution of BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> signaling to the energy sensor pathway. To test this hypothesis we starved BRAF mutant melanoma cells under serum free and low glucose conditions in the presence or absence of the Mek1/2 inhibitor U0126, and investigated the activation of LKB1-AMPK-mTOR pathway. UACC903, SKMel28 and A375 cells showed a very limited response to energy withdrawal as measured by the induction of phospho-AMPK&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004771-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). Under these conditions all cells retained considerable mTOR activity as indicated by the phosphorylation levels of ribosomal protein S6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004771-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). However, the addition of U0126 (10 &#x000b5;M) recovered AMPK&#x003b1; pathway activation in response to low energy conditions resulting in the complete abrogation of mTOR activity as indicated by phospho-S6 ribosomal protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004771-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>).

Mitogenic responses coordinate simultaneously cell growth with cell division. Since the activation of AMPK-TSC1/TSC2 pathway by LKB1 controls energy metabolism and protein synthesis, we examined whether the growth factor treatment leads to LKB1-AMPK dissociation, providing a mechanism that would assure cell growth upon a mitogenic stimulus and resistance to energy stress conditions. To investigate the underlying mechanism, we transfected 293T cells with Flag-tagged LKB1 and GST-AMPK&#x003b1; and then treated the cells with or without EGF in order to activate RAS pathway. After immunoprecipitation of the Flag-LKB1 complexes we checked for the presence of GST-AMPK&#x003b1; in the immunocomplexes. The data indicated that some fraction of AMPK&#x003b1; is constitutively bound to LKB1. Interestingly, treatment of cells with the growth factor induced dissociation of the LKB1-AMPK&#x003b1; complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004771-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). Moreover, this effect was totally independent of LKB1 kinase activity since Flag-tagged kinase dead LKB1 (LKB1<sup>KD</sup>) reproduced exactly the same result. Since growth factor stimulation promoted LKB1-AMPK&#x003b1; disassembly and this effect correlated with the phosphorylation of LKB1<sup>Ser428</sup> upon growth factor stimulation, we examined the role of the Ser428 (Ser431 in mouse) residue on this effect.

To confirm that, we performed an immunoprecipitation of the endogenous LKB1 in the BRAF mutant melanoma cells and examined the AMPK&#x003b1; association under low energy conditions with or without U0126 inhibitor.

UACC903 and A375 melanoma cell lines showed some spontaneous apoptosis under normal growing conditions: 5.71&#x00025; and 3.27&#x00025; respectively.

Glucose starvation for 12 hours resulted in slight increase in the number of double positive Annexin V-PI cells respect normal growing conditions: 1.27 fold for UACC903 cells and 2.35 fold for A375 cells.

As previously described for EGF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004771-Sapkota1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, we show that HGF and several other growth factors induce the phosphorylation of LKB1<sup>Ser431</sup> through the Ras-Erk1/2-p90<sup>RSK</sup> pathway.

The role of LKB1 in response to growth factors, and its connection to the RAS pathway, is mostly unknown. Our results show that melanoma cells harboring the BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> oncogenic mutation have a very limited response to metabolic stress. Interestingly, the inhibition of the BRAF signaling restores the ability of the cells to sense the low energy conditions. Notably, growth factor treatment and oncogenic BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> leads to the uncoupling of LKB1-AMPK&#x003b1; complexes, suggesting a mechanism that disconnects the energy sensor pathway, which is involved in controlling cell growth through the mTOR pathway in response to low energy conditions. Furthermore, inhibition of BRAF oncogenic signaling promotes the association of the LKB1-AMPK&#x003b1; complexes and results in an increase of apoptosis in response to metabolic stress.</p><p>Our screening for the discovery of novel molecules involved in HGF signaling in melanoma cells allowed us to identify by DIGE analysis proteins that were directly modified in response to c-Met activation by HGF (data not shown). Previously, it has been described that EGF and forskolin promote the phosphorylation of LKB1<sup>Ser428</sup> in a p90<sup>RSK</sup> and PKA dependent manner respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004771-Sapkota1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004771-Sapkota2">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. Our results showed that LKB1<sup>Ser431</sup> phosphorylation occurs in response to HGF and other different growth factors in a RAS-Erk1/2-p90<sup>RSK</sup> dependent manner as initially suggested by previous investigations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004771-Sapkota1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004771-Sapkota2">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, and according to siRNA knock down experiments (data not shown), cells expressing less than five percent of the LKB1 pool still respond to this stimulus, suggesting that LKB1 would have a relevant role in the mitogenic response to growth factors. Virtually all cancers have aberrant signaling of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), growth factors autocrine loops or activating mutations in the RAS pathway (RAS activating mutations or BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> mutation). We therefore hypothesized that LKB1 would be mediating some of the effects of the RAS and BRAF oncogenes. In agreement with this, LKB1<sup>Ser428</sup> appears to be constitutively phosphorylated in human melanoma cell lines harboring BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> activating mutations as an indicator of the interplay between RAS pathway and LKB1. Furthermore, LKB1<sup>Ser431</sup> (Ser428 in human) tends to be phosphorylated in mouse tumor samples harboring deregulated tyrosine kinase activities or increased mitogenic signaling, suggesting the direct participation of LKB1 in tumor biology.</p><p>LKB1 activity is controlled through its interaction with the STE20-related adaptor (STRAD) and Mo25 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004771-Dorfman1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004771-Boudeau1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. LKB1 can be phosphorylated at eight or more different residues, where the modifications at these amino acids have no effect on LKB1 kinase activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004771-Marignani1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. In the last five years a number of publications have reported several critical roles for LKB1 in different biological processes such as: energy metabolism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004771-Spicer1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004771-Shaw2">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, cell polarity and division <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004771-Williams1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004771-Spicer1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref> and transcriptional regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004771-Zeng1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. However, most of these studies rely on the presence or absence of LKB1 in these processes. Our data show that growth factor treatment induces both, LKB1<sup>Ser428</sup> phosphorylation and the dissociation of LKB1-AMPK&#x003b1; complexes. The participation of this residue in growth inhibition, cell polarity and the activation of the LKB1 downstream kinases (AMPK, BRSK1/2) have been controversial <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004771-Marignani1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004771-Xie1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004771-Boudeau2">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004771-Shelly1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004771-Fogarty1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. Indeed, our results regarding the participation of this residue in the growth factor-mediated dissociation of the LKB1-AMPK&#x003b1; complexes are not conclusive and more research is needed in order to elucidate the complete role of this residue. Moreover, we can no exclude the participation of additional residues or proteins in the process.</p><p>LKB1 is the upstream kinase of AMPK&#x003b1; and is linked to mTOR through the AMPK-TSC1/TSC2 cascade <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004771-Shaw1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004771-Shaw2">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004771-Lizcano1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref> controlling cell growth under energy stress conditions. One possible interpretation of our results would be that the dissociation of the LKB1-AMPK&#x003b1; complex would provide a mechanism to avoid interruption of protein synthesis through this pathway while cells are responding to a mitogenic stimulus. In this matter, the activation of RAS-Erk1/2 pathway would engage biochemical mechanisms to coordinate cell growth and division to assure cell proliferation. Importantly, the deregulation of the AMPK-mTOR axis by the dissociation of the LKB1-AMPK&#x003b1; complex in cells harboring RAS pathway activating mutations could represent an advantage for proliferation and a significant resistance increased to metabolic stress conditions. Notably, BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> mutant melanoma cell lines showed a limited sensitivity in response to low energy conditions. Treatment of cells with the Mek1/2 inhibitor U0126 allowed the formation of endogenous LKB1-AMPK&#x003b1; complexes and restored the energy sensor pathway in response to low energy conditions, supporting the proposed mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004771-g006">Fig. 6</xref>). Mek1/2 inhibitors (U0126, PD98059) have been reported to activate AMPK at 20 &#x000b5;M concentration, but not at 5&#x02013;10 &#x000b5;M <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004771-Dokladda1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. These experiments were done in glucose free medium and in the presence of growth factors with high levels of phospho-Erk1/2. According to our data the inhibition of the Erk1/2 pathway under low energy conditions would allow the re-association of LKB1-AMPK&#x003b1;, which in turn would result in an increase the levels of p-AMPK&#x003b1;. Furthermore, our data showed that in high glucose medium the addition of U0126 (10 &#x000b5;M) or sorafenib (data not shown) had no effect on AMPK&#x003b1; phosphorylation in all BRAF mutant cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004771-g005">Fig 5A</xref>). Up-to-date the connection between RAS pathway and LKB1 has been limited to the phosphorylation of LKB1<sup>Ser428</sup> residue through p90<sup>RSK</sup>. However, our results indicate that this modification is not enough to mediate the observed effect, suggesting the existence of additional biochemical mechanisms mediated by Erk1/2 that will account for the LKB1-AMPK&#x003b1; dissociation mediated by the RAS pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004771-g006">Fig. 6</xref>).</p><fig id="pone-0004771-g006" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0004771.g006</object-id><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>A model of the metabolic stress response regulation by oncogenic BRAF in melanoma cells.</title><p>Resistance to stress conditions is essential for melanoma cells survival. We propose that oncogenic BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> signaling (left panel) protects to apoptosis by regulating BH3-family members and confers resistance to low energy conditions promoting the uncoupling of LKB1 and AMPK through Erk1/2 and p90<sup>Rsk</sup>. Under this condition BRAF mutant cells have a limited response to low energy conditions. On the right panel the inhibition of BRAF signaling allows the formation of the LKB1-AMPK complexes restoring the energy stress pathway and promoting the down-regulation of anti-apoptotic proteins such as Mcl1.

Surprisingly, the inhibition of Erk1/2 pathway in BRAF mutant melanoma cell lines subjected to metabolic stress resulted in an increase in the number of dead cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004771-g006">Fig 6</xref>). Interestingly, our experiments knocking-down AMPK&#x003b1; suggests a causal link among the inhibition of oncogenic BRAF signaling, the reconstitution of the energy sensor pathway and the resulting cell death. In agreement with the interplay between the oncogenic signaling and AMPK is the recent finding where the activation of AMPK pathway by administration of metformin, phenformin or A-769662 to PTEN(&#x0002b;/&#x02212;) mice significantly delayed tumor onset, demonstrating that LKB1 is required for activators of AMPK to inhibit mTORC1 signaling as well as cell growth in PTEN-deficient cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004771-Huang1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, the increased apoptosis rate did not correlate with the stabilization of p53, indicating that the mechanism was apparently p53-independent and that BRAF oncogenic signaling was participating in the stabilization of p53. In fact, it is known that under genotoxic-stress conditions, Erk1/2 signaling mediates p53 stabilization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004771-Melnikova1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004771-Persons1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>.

The reactivation of the LKB1-AMPK-mTOR pathway under low energy conditions by the inhibition of BRAF signaling led to a more pronounced effect that included a drastic down-regulation of Mcl-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004771-g006">Fig 6</xref>).

These results, permit us to speculate that under normal growth conditions, this biochemical mechanism, through the activation of RAS pathway, could be involved in the coordination of two important processes in cell proliferation: cell growth and cell division. Interestingly, BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> mutant melanoma cells have minimal response to energy stressed conditions due to the constitutive dissociation of the LKB1-AMPK&#x003b1; complexes. However, under metabolic stress conditions the inactivation of BRAF oncogenic signaling restores the LKB1-AMPK&#x003b1;-mTOR pathway-promoting apoptosis in collaboration with BH3-only proteins and Mcl-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004771-g006">Fig 6</xref>). Importantly, this mechanism reveals a new level for therapeutical intervention triggering apoptosis of tumor cells. This might be particularly relevant in tumors harboring a deregulated RAF-Erk1/2 pathway that survive in energy stress conditions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cell lines</title><p>37-31E and 37-31T cells have been described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004771-Recio2">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>.
