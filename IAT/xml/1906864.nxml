The oxidative state of CRLPs was varied by exposure to CuSO<sub>4</sub> (oxCRLPs) or incorporation of the antioxidant, probucol (pCRLPs) into the particles. oxCRLPs caused significantly less accumulation of triacylglycerol in the macrophages than CRLPs, and their rate of uptake was lower, while pCRLPs caused more lipid accumulation and were taken up faster. Uptake of all 3 types of particles was inhibited to a similar extent when entry via the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor related protein (80&#x02013;90%), LDL receptor (&#x02212;&#x000a0;30&#x02013;40%), CD36 (&#x02212;&#x000a0;40%) and phagocytosis (&#x02212;&#x000a0;35&#x02013;40%) was blocked using lactoferrin, excess LDL, anti-CD36 and cytochalasin D, respectively, but blocking scavenger receptors-A or -B1 using poly inosinic acid or excess HDL had no effect. These findings show that oxidation of CRLPs lowers their rate of uptake and induction of lipid accumulation in macrophages. However, oxidation does not change the main pathways of internalisation of CRLPs into THP-1 macrophages, which occur mainly via the LRP with some contribution from the LDLr, while CD36 and phagocytosis have only a minor role, regardless of the oxidative state of the particles. Thus, the effects of CMR oxidation on foam cell formation contrast sharply with those of LDL oxidation and this may be important in the role of dietary oxidized lipids and antioxidants in modulating atherosclerosis.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Chylomicron remnants</kwd><kwd>Foam cells</kwd><kwd>Oxidized lipoproteins</kwd><kwd>Macrophages</kwd><kwd>Atherosclerosis</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p>Chylomicron remnants (CMR) carry lipids of dietary origin from the gut to the liver for processing <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref> and there is now a large and growing body of evidence indicating that these lipoproteins are strongly atherogenic. They have been shown to be taken up into the artery wall as efficiently as LDL <xref rid="bib2 bib3 bib4 bib5" ref-type="bibr">[2&#x02013;5]</xref>; remnant-like particles containing apolipoprotein E (apoE) have been isolated from human aortic intima and atherosclerotic plaque <xref rid="bib6 bib7" ref-type="bibr">[6,7]</xref>; and delayed clearance of CMR from the circulation correlates with lesion development <xref rid="bib8 bib9" ref-type="bibr">[8,9]</xref>. Moreover, we and others have shown that CMR induce extensive lipid accumulation causing foam cell formation in human monocyte-derived macrophages (HMDM) <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> and in human and murine monocyte/macrophages cell lines <xref rid="bib11 bib12" ref-type="bibr">[11,12]</xref>.</p><p>Low density lipoprotein (LDL) plays a major role in atherogenesis and in foam cell generation, but oxidation of the lipoprotein particles, a process which can occur within the artery wall, is necessary before extensive lipid accumulation is induced <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. In striking contrast, CMR do not require prior oxidation to cause macrophages to form foam cells <xref rid="bib10 bib11 bib12" ref-type="bibr">[10&#x02013;12]</xref>. However, our studies have demonstrated that incorporation of lipophilic antioxidants into the particles enhances, rather than inhibits, lipid uptake and accumulation in the cells <xref rid="bib14 bib15" ref-type="bibr">[14,15]</xref>, suggesting that the oxidative state of CMRs may play a role in their induction of foam cell formation, but in the opposite way to that of LDL. Oxidized CMR could occur either in the artery wall by the action of the cell-associated lipoxygenase and myeloperoxidase which are believed to oxidize LDL, or in the circulation, because dietary oxidised lipids, which are produced when fat is cooked at high temperatures, have been shown to be transported in these lipoproteins <xref rid="bib16 bib17" ref-type="bibr">[16,17]</xref>. Clearly, therefore, it is important for the understanding of the atherogenicity of CMR to establish how their oxidation influences their uptake and induction of foam cell formation and the pathways by which CMR are internalised by the cells.</p><p>It has been demonstrated that CMR are taken up by the liver by apolipoprotein E (apoE)-dependent pathways mediated by the LDL receptor (LDLr) and the LDL receptor-like protein (LRP) <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. The exact mechanisms by which CMR are taken up by macrophages, however, are not yet definitively established, and nothing is known about the effects of oxidation of the particles on the routes by which they are internalised. The LDL receptor (LDLr) appears to play a part <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, but as it is down-regulated by the influx of cholesterol into cells, native LDL does not induce foam cell formation <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, and our studies <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref> have suggested that the delivery of cholesterol to macrophages by CMR has a similar effect. Thus, other mechanisms are also likely to be involved, and evidence from experiments using antibodies to the LDLr and animals lacking the LDLr supports this view <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Candidates include the LRP <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, the apoB48 triacylglycerol-rich lipoprotein receptor (apoB48r) <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, an as yet unidentified 43&#x000a0;kDa protein described by Elsegood et al. <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> and scavenger receptors such as scavenger receptor A (SR-A) and CD36 <xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. Phagocytosis has also been suggested as a possible mechanism <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Since the route of uptake of LDL by macrophages is profoundly changed after oxidation from the regulated LDLr to the unregulated scavenger receptors <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, it is important to establish whether the oxidative state also alters the mechanisms of uptake of CMR by the cells.</p><p>The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of the oxidative state of CMR on their uptake by macrophages and on the accumulation of lipid within the cells, and to determine how oxidation affects the pathways involved in the internalisation of the particles. Chylomicron remnant-like particles (CRLPs) at three different levels of oxidation (CRLPs, oxidized CRLPs (oxCRLPs) and CRLPs containing the antioxidant probucol (pCRLPs)) and macrophages derived from the human monocyte cell line THP-1 were used as the experimental model, and the mechanisms of uptake were evaluated using specific inhibitors of the processes believed to be involved. The findings clearly demonstrate that oxidation of CRLPs reduces the rate of their uptake by THP-1 macrophages and decreases lipid accumulation in the cells, and further show that this is due to differential interaction with apoE dependent receptors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials-methods" id="sec1"><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><p>RPMI 1640 medium, fetal bovine serum (FBS), <sc>l</sc>-alanyl-<sc>l</sc>-glutamine (glutamax) penicillin/streptomycin and &#x003b2;-mercaptoethanol were obtained from Gibco (Paisley, UK).

These particles are similar in size, density and lipid composition to physiological remnants <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, and also contained human apoE, thus they differ from physiological CMR only in lacking apoB48. Importantly, extensive previous studies in both humans and experimental animals have demonstrated that chylomicron- and chylomicron remnant-like particles without apoB48 are cleared from the blood and metabolised in a similar way to the corresponding physiological lipoproteins <xref rid="bib31 bib32 bib33 bib34" ref-type="bibr">[31&#x02013;34]</xref>. In addition, CRLPs lacking apoB48, but containing apoE from the appropriate species, have been found to have effects which mimic those of physiological remnants in rat hepatocytes and pig endothelial cells <xref rid="bib23 bib35" ref-type="bibr">[23,35]</xref>, and our earlier work has shown that CRLPs cause extensive lipid accumulation in THP-1 macrophages and human monocyte derived macrophages (HMDM) which is comparable to that found in experiments with physiological CMR from rats and the murine macrophage cell line J774 <xref rid="bib24 bib36" ref-type="bibr">[24,36]</xref>. For the current investigation, the use of CRLPs facilitated the manipulation of the oxidative state of the particles by inclusion of the lipophilic antioxidant probucol or by exposure to oxidising conditions similar to those used extensively in studies with oxLDL <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. In previous work, we have shown that incorporation of probucol into CRLPs increases their uptake by THP-1 macrophages <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, and that this is due to protection of the particles from oxidation, since lycopene, a chemically unrelated antioxidant, has a similar effect <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. For the present study, therefore, we used pCRLPs in addition to CRLPs and oxCRLPs, so that 3 different oxidative states were tested. Assessment of TBARS in the particles used showed that the oxidative states of CRLPs, oxCRLPs or pCRLPs were significantly different, and there were no significant differences in their apoE content<italic>,</italic> thus they provided a convenient and suitable model for the study.</p><p>Earlier work in our laboratory and others has demonstrated that CMR cause the extensive lipid accumulation associated with foam cell formation in HMDM, THP-1 macrophages and murine macrophage cell lines <xref rid="bib24 bib36 bib37" ref-type="bibr">[24,36,37]</xref>. In experiments with THP-1 macrophages and HMDM, we found that CRLPs induced a greater increase in the intracellular total lipid content than oxLDL (at the equivalent cholesterol level), and that, as might be expected, this was mainly due to greater accumulation of TG, while TC levels were raised to a comparable extent with both types of lipoprotein <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. In the current study we compared the effects of oxidized and non-oxidized particles and, although both caused rises in cellular lipid content compared to untreated cells, the increase was clearly smaller with oxCRLPs as compared to CRLPs, mainly because of decreased accumulation of TG (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>). These results suggest that the uptake of CRLPs by the cells may be inhibited by oxidation, and this was confirmed in confocal microscopy and FACS studies (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3</xref>), which showed that the rate of uptake of CRLPs was decreased by oxidation and increased by incorporation of probucol into the particles to protect them from oxidation (<xref rid="tbl2" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). These results clearly demonstrate that oxidation of CMR inhibits their uptake by macrophages and attenuates foam cell formation. This is an important new finding, since this effect is strikingly different from that found with LDL, where oxidation is required to induce macrophages to form foam cells.</p><p>CMR are known to be cleared from the circulation by the liver mainly by apoE-dependent pathways involving the LDLr and the LRP, and the present study shows that apoE also plays an important role in the entry of CRLPs into THP-1 macrophages, since a markedly reduced rate of uptake was observed when apoE was not present in the particles. These finding are in agreement with earlier work which has suggested that both the LDLr and the LRP are involved in the uptake of CMR by macrophages <xref rid="bib10 bib19 bib38" ref-type="bibr">[10,19,38]</xref>. Our results indicate that both receptors are able to mediate the uptake of CRLPs regardless of their oxidative state, although lactoferrin, a ligand for the LRP, caused a marked reduction in lipid accumulation and uptake after exposure of THP-1 macrophages to all three types of CRLPs (<xref rid="fig4 fig5" ref-type="fig">Figs. 4, 5</xref>), while the maximum effect of excess LDL on uptake observed was more modest in all cases (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>). This lesser role of the LDLr may be due to its down-regulation on the influx of lipoprotein into cells. We have shown previously that the expression of mRNA for the LDLr in THP-1 macrophages is decreased by CRLPs while the expression of LRP mRNA is increased <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, and the present study, which shows a decrease of about 73% in LDLr mRNA and a 2.7fold rise in LRP mRNA after exposure of the macrophages to CRLPs, is in agreement with these findings.</p><p>The differences in rates of uptake of oxCRLPs, CRLPs and pCRLPs were retained in the presence of inhibitors of both the LDLr and the LRP, although when both the LDLr and the LRP were blocked, uptake of oxCRLPs, CRLPs and pCRLPs was reduced to a similar low level (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5</xref>), suggesting that the difference in their rate of uptake is apoE-dependent. Thus, an important novel finding of this study is that oxidation of CRLPs, unlike LDL, does not change their major routes of uptake by macrophages, with apoE-dependent receptors being of major importance and the LRP playing the predominant role, regardless of the oxidative state of the particles. ApoE does not bind to the LDLr family in its lipid-free state, as interaction with lipid is necessary to induce a conformational change which promotes high affinity for the receptors <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. In addition, apoE has been shown to adopt different conformations when complexed to different lipids. Thus, changes in the lipid composition of lipoproteins such as an increased content of oxidized lipids or the presence of lipophilic compounds such as probucol may alter the conformation of the protein on their surface, and not all apoE molecules on a particular remnant particle may be able to act as ligands <xref rid="bib39 bib40" ref-type="bibr">[39,40]</xref>. The different rates of uptake of CRLPs oxCRLPs and pCRLPs by macrophages demonstrated here, therefore, could be explained by effects on interaction with the LDLr and the LRP caused by differences both in the conformation of apoE and in the number of apoE molecules able to bind to the receptors, even though the total amount of apoE associated with the particles is not changed. Although we cannot rule out the possibility that the faster internalization of pCRLPs is due a specific effect of probucol on the surface structure of the particles, the finding that CRLPs are taken up more slowly after oxidation and more rapidly when the antioxidant is present suggests the changes are more likely to be related to the amounts of oxidized lipid in the particles.</p><p>The expression of scavenger receptors such as SR-A and the class B receptors CD36 and SR-B1 is a characteristic feature of macrophages, and SR-A and CD36 are know to play a part in the induction of foam cell formation by oxidized or chemically modified LDL <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. It is possible, therefore, that this type of receptor may also be involved the uptake of oxCMR by macrophages. In the present study, poly I, a ligand for SR-A, reduced the uptake of acLDL by THP-1 cells by about 90% as expected, but had no significant effect on the uptake of CRLPs, irrespective of their oxidative state. In addition, excess HDL, which binds to SR-B1, did not prevent the entry of CRLPs, oxCRLPs or pCRLPs into the cells. In contrast, in the presence of anti-CD36, the uptake of all three CRLP types was inhibited by about 35&#x02013;40% so that the differences in their rates of uptake were retained (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>). Thus, SR-A and SR-B1 do not appear to play a significant part in the uptake of oxCRLPs by macrophages, although CD36 may have a role which is unaffected by the oxidative state of the particles.</p><p>Mamo et al. <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> have reported previously that the phagocytosis may be important in the uptake of CMR by rabbit alveolar macrophages, although in a later electron microscopy study with HMDM they found no evidence for entry via this route <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. In our experiments with THP-1 macrophages, however, cytochalasin D inhibited the uptake of all CRLPs types tested by 35&#x02013;40%, suggesting that some phagocytosis of CRLPs of all oxidative states does occur in these cells (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref>).</p><p>It has been suggested that the apoB48r may be involved in the uptake of chylomicron remnants by macrophages <xref rid="bib1 bib20" ref-type="bibr">[1,20]</xref>, and Kawakami et al. <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref> have reported that it is responsible for the induction of macrophage foam cell formation by remnant lipoproteins from hyperlipidemic patients. Since apoB48 is an integral protein incorporated during the assembly of chylomicrons in intestinal cells, it is not possible to bind it to model CRLPs in a physiological way. The particles used in the present work, therefore, do not contain apoB48 and we were unable to study involvement of this receptor in the uptake of CMR by macrophages. However, antibodies to apoB48 have been found not to inhibit the uptake of chylomicron remnants by rat macrophages <xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>, and Elsegood et al. <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref> who were unable to detect binding of chylomicron remnants to a protein with a molecular weight corresponding to the apoB48 receptor in THP-1 macrophages have suggested that it may be specific for VLDL remnants rather than chylomicron remnants.</p><p>The results of this study demonstrate that oxidative modification of CMR as compared to LDL has profoundly different effects on the uptake of the particles and the subsequent induction of lipid accumulation in macrophages. Instead of markedly enhancing foam cell formation, oxidation of CMR slows their uptake by macrophages and reduces the amount of lipid subsequently accumulated in the cells. This difference may be due to the different receptor mechanisms involved, since oxidation of LDL shifts the main route of uptake from the regulated LDLr to the unregulated scavenger receptors, while our experiments suggest that CMR are taken up mainly by the LRP with some contribution from the LDLr, with CD36 and phagocytosis playing only minor roles, irrespective of their oxidative state. These findings provide important new information about the way in which oxidation of CMR influences their induction of foam cell formation and the mechanisms involved, and has important implications for the role of dietary factors such as oxidized lipids and antioxidants which are transported in CMR in the promotion of atherosclerosis.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We gratefully acknowledge the support of the British Heart Foundation and the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council for studentships (sponsored by GlaxoSmithKline) for FB and EHM.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>[1]</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Yu</surname><given-names>K.C.</given-names></name><name><surname>Cooper</surname><given-names>A.D.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Postprandial lipoproteins and atherosclerosis</article-title><source>Front.
