They may act as molecular chaperones by preventing aggregation and assisting refolding of misfolded proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Hsps could be induced in response to a physiological effect or environmental effect of stress, such as elevation in temperature, oxidative stress, viral infection, nutritional deficiency, or toxic chemical exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. On the basis of molecular weight, mammalian Hsps have been classified into various families, including Hsp105, 90, 70, 60, and other small Hsps [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The 105 kDa protein is one of the major mammalian Hsp which belongs to the family of higher molecular mass, and is composed of 858 amino acid residues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Hatayama et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] demonstrated a role of this protein in protecting neuronal cells against stress-induced apoptosis in rat neuronal PC12 cells, suggesting that this protein may be a novel anti-apoptotic neuroprotective factor in the mammalian brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Increasing evidences indicate that Hsps could regulate cell apoptosis either by directly promoting cell apoptosis or by inhibiting apoptotic response as a chaperone of a key signaling protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. We have demonstrated that Hsp105 was expressed in monkey testis and may play an important role in regulation of germ cell apoptosis induced by heat stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Hsp105 may function as a pro-apoptotic factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] or as an anti-apoptotic factor depending on cell type in mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>The evidences from our previous studies both on rhesus monkey and human being demonstrated that a relatively high frequency of apoptosis occurs in the secretory endometrium, correlated to the period of formation of implantation window [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] which was a limited period of endometrial receptivity to blastocyst stimulus[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The time surrounding the window of receptivity in the rat is referred to as the peri-implantation period and involves days 4, 5, and 6 of pregnancy. In response to implanting embryos the underlying endometrial stromal cells undergo decidualization that involves proliferation and differentiation through cell division and apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Apoptosis is a physiological process which remodels tissue by removing expendable cells without allowing the entry of proteolytic enzymes and other harmful or corrosive substances into the surrounding tissue, and thus reducing the likelihood of an inflammatory response[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>Localization of apoptotic cells in relation to the expression of apoptosis-related molecules, such as Fas/FasL, Bcl-2/Bax, and P53 have been demonstrated in the materno-fetal boundary of rhesus monkeys in pregnancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Apoptotic nuclei were observed mainly in the glandular cells and the blood vessel endothelial cells in decidua [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. A transient increase in Hsp105 expression during mouse embryogenesis was observed in the embryonic tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Human endometrium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], deciduas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] and trophoblast tissues have been also reported to be capable of expressing Hsps during the first trimester of pregnancy[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], however, to the best of our knowledge, no studies about an action of Hsp105 in mammalian uterus during implantation have been reported. In the present study, we have analyzed Hsp105 protein expression in rat uterus of early pregnancy, and examined the effect of injection of antisense Hsp105 oligodeoxynucleotides into the pregnant uterine horn on embryo implantation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>Spague Dawley rats were obtained from the Animal Facility of Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences. The Guidelines for the Care and Use of Animals in Research enforced by Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Commission were followed. All protocols have been approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences. The rats were caged in a controlled environment with a 14 hr light:10 hr dark cycle. The adult females were mated with fertile males of the same strain to induce pregnancy (day 1, D1 = day of vaginal plug positive). Pregnancy on D1&#x02013;5 was confirmed by flushing embryos from the reproductive tracts. The implantation sites on D6&#x02013;7 were identified by intravenous injection of 1% (w/v) trypan blue (Sigma Chemical Company, St. Louis, MO) in 0.85% (w/v) sodium chloride, according to the procedures described by Chun <italic>et al</italic>. and Xiao <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. In several experiments, some male rats were vasectomized, and after 14 days they were used to mate with females to induce pseudo-pregnancy (PD, PD1 = day of vaginal plug positive).</p></sec><sec><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>In the designed time points the animals were killed by cervical dislocation under anaesthetic and the uteri were collected. In some experiments the implantation sites on day 6 and 7 were separated from the inter-implantation segments, the corrected uterine materials were fixed immediately in 10% neutral buffered formalin solution (Beijing Chemical Reagents Co. Beijing, China) overnight, and then embedded in paraffin. Serial 5 &#x003bc;m sections of the uterine tissues were deparaffinized and rehydrated through degraded ethanol. Antigen retrieval was performed by incubating the sections in 0.01 M citrate buffer (pH 6.0) at 98&#x000b0;C for 20 min, followed by cooling at room temperature for 20 min. Non-specific binding was blocked with 5% (v/v) normal goat serum (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc) in PBS for 1 h. The sections were incubated with the primary antibodies against Hsp105 (sc-6241, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA 1: 200) in 10% goat serum overnight at 4&#x000b0;C. The sections were then washed three times with PBS (10 min each) and incubated with biotin labeled secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit IgG, RT, 30 min, 1:200), After three times washes with PBS, the sections were incubated with avidin-AP complex (1:200, RT, 20 min). After three more washes, the sections were developed with Vector Red AP substrates according to the manufacturer's protocol (Vectastain ABCAP kit, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA). Endogenous AP activity was inhibited by supplement of 1 mM levamisole (Sigma Corp., St. Louis, MO) into the substrate. The sections stained with Vector Red substrates were counter-stained with haematoxylin. The sections incubated with normal IgG instead of the primary antibody served as the negative controls.</p></sec><sec><title>Western blot analysis</title><p>The uteri from various groups were homogenized respectively in the lysis buffer (5 mmol/L phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, containing 0.1% Triton X-100, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride, and 1 mg/L chymostatin), and the concentration of protein in the supernatant after centrifugation was determined by UV spectrophotometer. The sample lysates in each group were mixed with the loading buffer (62.5 mM 1,4- dithiothreitol, 5% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), and 10% glycerol), boiled for 8 min, and then separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) (50 &#x003bc;g total protein/lane). The separated proteins were transferred electrophoretically onto a pure nitrocellulose blotting membrane (Pall Corporation, Pensacola, FL), and then incubated with blocking buffer (3% BSA (v/v) in TBST for 1 h at room temperature. The membrane was subsequently incubated with the anti-Hsp105 antibodies overnight at 4&#x000b0;C, washed for three times with TBST, 15 min each time, and further incubated for 1 h at room temperature with TBST containing alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies, and then washed three times with TBST. After one more time of wash with TBS, then the membrane was subjected to an alkaline phosphatase color reaction by a standard method. Actin protein was used as the internal control for cytosolic protein. Band intensity was determined by Quantity One Software (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA).</p></sec><sec><title>Design of oligodeoxynucleotides specific sequence for Hsp105</title><p>The sequence(s) of oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) (16 nucleotides in length) were: sense oligodeoxynucleotides(S-ODNs):5'-AGCCATGTCGGTGGTT-3, antisense oligodeoxy- nucleotides (A-ODNs): 5'-AACCACCGACATGGCT-3'. The A-ODNs were complementary to bases 191&#x02013;206 bp within exon I of the rat <italic>Hsp105 </italic>(GenBank Accession Number: <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="NM_001011901">NM_001011901</ext-link>). All the sequences were thiophosphate-modified for their long half-lives in cells. FITC/A-ODNs and FITC/S-ODNs are FITC-conjugated ODNs at the 3' end. All the ODNs were synthesized by SBS Genetech Co., Ltd. (Beijing, China). Analysis of homology between the synthesized oligomer and the rodent sequences present in the GenBank data bases (release 73.0) by the Genetics Computer Group sequence analysis software package revealed that the synthetic oligomers were fully complementary only to their own specific mRNA.</p></sec><sec><title>Tracking of FITC- labeled ODNs in the tissue of rat uterus</title><p>Pregnant rats were injected with <italic>Hsp105 </italic>S-ODNs or A-ODNs according to the procedures described by Zhu <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Tracking of FITC-labeled ODNs was performed according to the procedures described by Luu <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Uterine penetration of the ODNs and cross-contamination between the two horns were assessed by injecting 10 &#x003bc;g (in 100 &#x003bc;L distilled water) of FITC-A-ODNs or FITC-S-ODNs into one horn, with either unlabeled standard control A-ODNs or S-ODNs alone into the contralateral horn of the uterus. The uteri were excised and frozen in OCT compound (QIAGEN N.V.) at 2.5 h, 24 h and 48 h after injection of the ODNs. 6 &#x003bc;m thick frozen sections were then analyzed under a fluorescence microscope at 488 nm.</p><p>The ODNs experiments were carried out in the afternoon on day 3 of pregnancy. The animals were divided into two groups, each group (n = 12/ODNs pair, 6 for S-ODNs and the other 6 for A-ODNs) was subject to a surgical operation and each uterine horn was injected with 10 &#x003bc;g of A-ODNs targeted against exon I of the Hsp105 or the corresponding S-ODNs or double distilled water (DD water). The animals were killed at 24 h and 48 h, respectively, after the operation, the uteri were fixed immediately for overnight in 10% neutral buffered formalin solution (Beijing Chemical Reagents Co. Beijing, China) and embedded in paraffin. Serial 5 &#x003bc;m sections of the uterine tissues were deparaffinized and rehydrated through graded ethanol for immunohistochemical analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Microscopic assessment and statistical analysis</title><p>The uterine samples from 3 rats in each group were analyzed. Experiments were repeated at least three times, from which one taken from at least three similar results was presented as a representative of the immunocytochemical data in the group. Signal intensities of Hsp105 detected by immunohistochemistry were quantified by computer-aided laser-scanning densitometry (Personal Densitometer SI; Molecular Dynamics, Inc., Sunnyvale, CA). In order to make the statistical significance of quantitative difference credible, three slides from each of six animals of each group were examined (n = 6), and 40 spots were randomly selected in every specific location of the specific cell types. The gray level of intercellular substance was considered as background. Statistical analysis was carried out with SPSS (version 10.0, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL), and one-way ANOVA was used followed by Post-Hoc comparisons for analyzing the data in different groups. P values lower than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. To estimate specific staining in various cells of the uteri, a semi-quantitative subjective scoring was also performed by three blinded investigators using a 4-scale system with &#x02013; (nil), +/- (weak), + (moderate), and ++ (strong), as described by Yue <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. The statistical data of Western blot from three individual experiments were analyzed by using Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS for Windows package release 10.0, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). Statistical significance was determined by one-way ANOVA. Post-Hoc comparisons between groups were made using Fisher's protected least-significance-difference test. Values were means &#x000b1; SEM. P values lower than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Hsp105 expression in rat uterus during early pregnancy</title><p>In order to examine developmental expression of Hsp105 in rat uterus of normal pregnancy, we performed immunohistochemistry using an antibody against rat Hsp105 protein.

Our data also show that the presence of embryo in uterus as a stimulus may be important for increasing Hsp105 expression. If Hsp105 is involved in regulation of endometrial differentiation for embryo implantation, one may expect that a reduction of its expression could prevent acquisition of receptive state of the endometrium leading to a failure of implantation. Therefore, we designed an experiment with <italic>Hsp105 </italic>antisense oligodeoxynucleotides directly injecting into pregnant rat uterus at early pregnancy, which allowed us to investigate a function of this protein in the process of implantation. Technically, it would be important to do such an experiment to know the transient nature of <italic>Hsp105 </italic>gene expression in the uterus. In order to select an appropriate time window of ODNs administration for blockage of Hsp105 expression, we reasoned that the time window should be immediately preceding that of Hsp105 induction, i.e., between days 3 and 6 of gestation. The precise half-life of the <italic>Hsp105 </italic>mRNA or its protein in uterus has not yet been determined, nevertheless, the modified <italic>Hsp105 </italic>ODNs are known to have a half life of 24&#x02013;48 hours in certain tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Therefore, ODNs were designed for injection in the afternoon of day 3 of pregnancy, one may expect the tissue on observation to survive for the subsequent 3&#x02013;4 days of gestation, for an effective suppression of the surge of Hsp105 expression. Because rat embryos were observed to be also capable of expressing Hsp105 (unpublished data), we examined a potential effect of ODNs on embryonic development by observing its normality. Therefore we selected a much later time point (Day 9) to count and examine the embryos. The statistical analysis of the difference of the numbers of implanted embryo between the antisense- and the sense ODNs-treated groups indicated that embryo implantation was indeed prohibited by the antisense ODNs (P &#x0003c; 0.01). These results together with the other observations suggest that treatment with antisense <italic>Hsp105 </italic>ODNs, but not with complementary sense ODNs, could severely impair the process of embryo implantation, but no effect on the normality of implanted embryos was observed on day 9 of pregnancy. However, Nakamura et al. just recently generated the Hsp105 knockout mice which did not appear a problem with reproduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>], implying that Hsp105 may be not the necessary gene required for implantation in mouse. However, the authors did not specifically pay attention to examine if the animals had any implantation defect present. Hsp105 family has another two members, APG1 and APG which have shown a similar function with Hsp105, and may rescue its function in the absence of Hsp105. We have demonstrated previously that plasminogen activator is important in ovulation of rat and monkeys both in vivo and in vitro[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], however, double knockout of tPA and uPA in mice showed only 26% inhibition of ovulation could be observed[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Our further studies showed that mouse ovary produces not tPA and uPA, but also MMPs which have also shown to play a role in ovulation. It is possible that MMPs could rescue the function in absence of tPA or uPA. Implantation is a very complex event, which involves various processes, such as blastocyst adhesion, trophoblast invasion, decidualization and cell-to-cell interaction, controlled by a variety of molecules produced by endometrium, embryo and ovary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. During mammalian implantation stroma of the endometrium undergoes severe remodeling, involving apoptosis, proteolysis and angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Endometrial cells rapidly proliferate and differentiate to form the decidua tissue which accommodates and protects implanted embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. In our previous reports, analysis of the endometrium of both rhesus monkey and human during peri-implantation period has demonstrated that a relatively high frequency of apoptosis occurs in the secretory endometrium and is correlated to increased expression of apoptosis related molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], while only limited numbers of the apoptotic cells were observed in the other phases of the cycle. It appears that endometrial apoptosis and the cyclic changes in endometrial growth and regression during establishment of implantation window might be regulated precisely and coordinately, not only by <italic>Fas</italic>, <italic>FasL</italic>, <italic>BcL-2 </italic>and <italic>Bax </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], but also by <italic>Hsp105</italic>, because the profile of these molecules is well correlated with that of the Hsp105 expression in rat uterus as demonstrated in the present study. Evidence has shown that Hsp105 is capable of enhancing cell apoptosis in mouse embryonal F9 cells[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>] and murine embryos during embryogenesis[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. On the contrary, the Hsp protein was also observed to inhibit cell apoptosis in rat testis and some experimental cell models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. These observations suggest that Hsp105 may be involved in regulation of murine uterine cell apoptosis. Since the cell types, species used in the individual studies were different, some unknown factors as well as cellular environment present in the various studies might determine an inhibitory or a promotional effect of the Hsp protein on cell apoptosis. However, the molecular mechanism of Hsp105 in regulating uterine cell apoptosis during rat periimplantation period remains to be further investigated. In summary, our data have demonstrated a significant increase in Hsp105 expression on day 5. It seems that the protein might be able to induce luminal cell apoptosis which in turn destabilizes epithelial barrier at implantation site and facilitates trophoblast invasion and implantation. On D6 of pregnancy Hsp105 expression was down-regulated in luminal epithelium, and upregulated in stroma cells adjacent to the embryo attachment. The dynamic changes in the level of expression of this protein during early implantation period suggest involvement of this protein in certain cellular events in luminal epithelial and stromal cells, which are essential for implantation.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>JXY participated together with LJX and YXL in the design of the study.
