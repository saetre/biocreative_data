The molecular basis for the development and survival of memory B cells remains largely unknown. We report that phospholipase C (PLC) &#x003b3;2 is required for efficient formation of germinal center (GC) and memory B cells. Moreover, memory B cell homeostasis is severely hampered by inducible loss of PLC-&#x003b3;2. Accordingly, mice with a conditional deletion of PLC-&#x003b3;2 in post-GC B cells had an almost complete abrogation of the secondary antibody response. Collectively, our data suggest that PLC-&#x003b3;2 conveys a survival signal to GC and memory B cells and that this signal is required for a productive secondary immune response.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Humoral memory is characterized by recall immune responses, which are more rapid than the primary response, and by production of higher serum titers of antigen-specific antibodies, mostly of the IgG isotype. The prevailing view is that antigen-specific B cells are maintained as a pool of memory B cells after clonal expansion during the primary immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>). Most memory B cells have been thought to originate from the germinal center (GC) reaction. In the GC, the combined processes of somatic hypermutation and selection based on the affinity of the B cell receptor (BCR) for the antigen are responsible for the generation of high-affinity antibody variants that ultimately differentiate into long-lived plasma cells or long-lived memory B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>). The GC is also a preferential site of antibody class switching. In the GC reaction, de novo&#x02013;generated antigen-specific memory B cells are thought to acquire intrinsically different traits from their naive predecessors, accounting for faster and heightened secondary responses. Thus, understanding the mechanism by which memory B cells are generated and maintained, as well as the intrinsic functional differences between naive and memory B cells, is of fundamental interest to reveal the basis of immunological memory.</p><p>The analysis of gene-targeted mice lacking the cytoplasmic tail of the IgG1 or IgE BCR has revealed its essential function in secondary responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>). In response to T cell&#x02013;dependent antigens, mice harboring the tailless IgG1 had &#x0223c;25-fold fewer IgG1-expressing B cells, presumably reflecting a reduced number of GC and memory B cells and raising the possibility that the IgG1 cytoplasmic tail is involved in the generation and/or maintenance of memory B cells or their direct precursors. Two non&#x02013;mutually exclusive models have been proposed to explain the function of the IgG1 tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>). First, it may be required for efficient BCR-mediated internalization and, hence, presentation of antigen to T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>). As T cells facilitate productive IgG1 memory responses, inefficient antigen presentation by mutant B cells could lead to defective proliferation of GC B cells and, consequently, diminished generation of memory B cells. Second, the IgG1 tail may contribute to memory responses by modifying the BCR signal, for example by transmitting survival signals to memory B cells and/or their direct precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>).</p><p>To define the signaling molecules required for the establishment and maintenance of memory B cells, we focused on the function of phospholipase C (PLC) &#x003b3;2 because this enzyme is well recognized as an important component of the BCR signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>). Indeed, PLC-&#x003b3;2&#x02013;deficient mice show a differentiation block between the immature and mature B cell stages owing to defective BCR signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>). However, given the expression of PLC-&#x003b3;2 in several immune cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>) and the premature block in B cell development in conventional PLC-&#x003b3;2 KO mice, these mice are not ideal for analyzing the role of PLC-&#x003b3;2 in a B cell&#x02013;intrinsic manner during T cell&#x02013;dependent antibody responses. Thus, we used conditional mice in which PLC-&#x003b3;2 function was specifically inactivated in GC B cells and in an inducible manner. We show in this paper that PLC-&#x003b3;2 is required for the efficient generation and maintenance of memory B cells, probably through the delivery of a prosurvival signal.</p><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Recall responses are severely impaired in mice with conditional deletion of PLC-&#x003b3;2 in GC B cells</title><p>For conditional ablation of PLC-&#x003b3;2 in GC B cells, we crossed PLC-&#x003b3;2 conditional (flox) mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>) to C&#x003b3;1-Cre mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>) to generate PLC-&#x003b3;2<sup>f/f</sup>&#x02013;C&#x003b3;1-Cre<sup>KI/wt</sup>, which we designated PLC G1KO mice. In C&#x003b3;1-Cre mice, Cre recombinase is expressed predominantly in GC B cells activated to express the C&#x003b3;1 germline transcript before switching to IgG1. Cre-mediated deletion of the PLC-&#x003b3;2 gene in C&#x003b3;1-Cre mice is expected to occur mainly in the GC B cells of mice immunized with T-dependent antigens. We found that B cell development was normal in PLC G1KO mice and that there were no major changes in basal serum Ig levels except for those of IgG1 and IgG3, which were 8.2- and 3.2-fold decreased, respectively, compared with control mice (Fig. S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20082100/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20082100/DC1</ext-link>). This phenotype enabled us to analyze the intrinsic roles of PLC-&#x003b3;2 in B cells during the immune response, including recall responses.</p><p>When PLC G1KO mice were immunized with the T cell&#x02013;dependent antigen 4-hydroxy-3-nitrophenylacetyl (NP)&#x02013;chicken &#x003b3;-globulin (CGG) adsorbed on alum, the PLC-&#x003b3;2 gene was efficiently deleted in the majority of NIP<sup>+</sup>IgG1<sup>+</sup>CD38<sup>dull</sup> GC B cells and NIP<sup>+</sup>IgG1<sup>+</sup>CD38<sup>hi</sup> memory B cells on day 10 after the primary immunization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>, left). Flow cytometric determination of PLC-&#x003b3;2 protein in IgG1<sup>+</sup> B cells of PLC G1KO mice showed a 10-fold reduction when compared with control B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>, right). There was a modest reduction in antigen-specific IgG1 levels in the PLC G1KO mice after primary immunization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>), confirming previous studies showing a modest impairment in primary IgG1 responses in PLC-&#x003b3;2&#x02013;null mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>). Consistent with this result, only a slight decrease was observed in the number of anti-NP IgG1 spot-forming cells in the spleen on day 10 after primary immunization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>). Later, on day 40 after primary immunization, anti-NP IgG1 spot-forming cells could be detected in the BM of PLC G1KO mice, although their numbers were reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>). There was no significant difference in the affinity maturation anti-NP IgG1 antibodies in PLC G1KO and control animals (Fig. S2 A, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20082100/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20082100/DC1</ext-link>). Furthermore, accumulation of mutations in the V<sub>H</sub>186.2 gene of GC B cells isolated from NP-CGG&#x02013;immunized mice, including the W33L mutation that leads to a 10-fold increase in affinity for the antigen, was unaffected upon acute PLC-&#x003b3;2 ablation in GC B cells (Fig. S2 B).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>The secondary IgG1 response is impaired in PLC G1KO mice.</bold> (A) PLC G1KO and control mice were immunized with NP-CGG, and the deletion efficiency of the PLC-&#x003b3;2 gene in GC and memory B cells was assessed by semiquantitative PCR (left).

The number of NP-specific IgG1-forming cells in the spleen of PLC G1KO mice was fourfold reduced compared with control mice on day 20 after the secondary immunization, indicating that the observed reduction in IgG1 production was at least partly a result of an impaired formation of antibody-secreting cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>PLC-&#x003b3;2 is required for efficient generation of GC and memory B cells</title><p>Having demonstrated the importance of PLC-&#x003b3;2 in recall IgG1 responses, we wished to address the underlying mechanism.

Although GC and memory responses in control mice were lower than those previously observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>), probably because of the immunization protocol and/or genetic background, the numbers of both NIP<sup>+</sup>IgG1<sup>+</sup>CD38<sup>dull</sup> GC B cells and NIP<sup>+</sup>IgG1<sup>+</sup>CD38<sup>hi</sup> memory B cells were reduced in PLC G1KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>).

As demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 A</xref>, Hoechst 33342 staining revealed that the percentage of PLC G1KO GC B cells in S phase was slightly reduced, and there was an even more pronounced reduction in G2/M phases, suggesting that depletion of PLC-&#x003b3;2 affected cell division by GC B cells. We next analyzed the frequency of GC B cells that had recently triggered the apoptotic program by assessing the disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 B</xref>, the frequency of IgG1<sup>+</sup> apoptotic GC B cells, in which the fluorochrome JC-1 remained monomeric in the cytosol because of disrupted mitochondrial membrane potential, was higher in PLC G1KO mice.

To address this issue, we conditionally deleted the PLC-&#x003b3;2 gene using the tamoxifen-inducible Cre-ER<sup>T2</sup> transgene (PLC-&#x003b3;2 conditional KO [cKO] mice). To minimize the effects of PLC-&#x003b3;2 loss on memory B cell formation, we delayed the administration of 4-hydroxy tamoxifen (4OHT) to day 30 after primary immunization when active GC reactions have subsided. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 B</xref>, memory B cell formation proceeded normally in PLC-&#x003b3;2 cKO mice before 4OHT treatment. In contrast, on day 10 after 4OHT treatment, when the PLC-&#x003b3;2 gene in IgG1<sup>+</sup> cells was efficiently deleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref>) the frequency of NIP<sup>+</sup>IgG1<sup>+</sup> memory B cells was markedly reduced in PLC cKO mice, whereas it remained unchanged in mice harboring only the Cre-ER<sup>T2</sup> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 B</xref>). Importantly, T cell numbers were unchanged after this treatment. Thus, although our data cannot completely rule out the possibility that deletion of PLC-&#x003b3;2 in non-B cells affects the maintenance of memory B cells, it is more likely that memory B cells require PLC-&#x003b3;2 in an intrinsic manner for their maintenance.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p><bold>Inducible deletion of PLC-&#x003b3;2 in immunized mice after the establishment of memory B cells.</bold> 30 d after the primary immunization, the PLC cKO mice were injected with sunflower oil alone or with oil containing 4OHT, as described in Materials and methods, to conditionally ablate the PLC-&#x003b3;2 gene.

These results support a model in which PLC-&#x003b3;2 contributes to maintenance of memory cells in a B cell&#x02013;intrinsic manner and suggest that the BCR is the receptor that utilizes PLC-&#x003b3;2 to generate a survival signal and is therefore required for maintenance of humoral memory.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Previous studies have shown that PLC-&#x003b3;2 is required for transition from the immature to the mature B cell stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>).

Moreover, maintenance of memory B cells also requires PLC-&#x003b3;2 function. Despite the reduced numbers of GC B cells, after the primary immunization only a modest reduction in antigen-specific IgG1 levels was observed in PLC-&#x003b3;2&#x02013;insufficient mice, suggesting that PLC-&#x003b3;2 has no direct significant role in differentiation of GC B to plasma cells.</p><p>In vivo evidence suggests the importance of CD40, BAFF-R, and BCR for efficient generation and/or maintenance of GC B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>). Thus, defects in proliferation and/or survival of PLC-&#x003b3;2&#x02013;deficient GC IgG1<sup>+</sup> B cells could be accounted for by defective signals emanating from these receptors. We made repeated attempts to perform in vitro GC B cell survival experiments to identify the defective receptor in PLC-&#x003b3;2&#x02013;insufficient cells. However, GC B cells, as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>), promptly undergo apoptosis thereby preventing this line of experimentation. Extrapolating from what is known about naive B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>), we speculate that not only BCR but also CD40 and BAFF-R use PLC-&#x003b3;2 to confer survival and proliferative activity on GC B cells. In addition, considering that CD40 and BAFF-R can induce such cellular outcomes independently of antigen affinity, one possible explanation for the minor effects of PLC-&#x003b3;2 depletion on affinity maturation might be that PLC-&#x003b3;2 in CD40 and/or BAFF-R signaling, rather than BCR signaling, more dominantly affects the in vivo phenotype. Because the majority of memory B cells are thought to be derived from GC B cells, the defective generation of GC B cells observed in PLC-&#x003b3;2&#x02013;insufficient mice would be expected to result in a decrease in memory B cell numbers.</p><p>A unique feature of memory B cells is their prolonged life span; however, little is known about mechanisms required for memory B cell maintenance. Several extrinsic factors, including antigen and cytokines, are known to affect the development and survival of memory T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>). In contrast, several observations favor the idea that memory T cell and B cell survival is independent of antigen receptor occupancy, although the issue is still being debated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>). For instance, using an elegant in vivo system in which BCR specificity could be changed after memory B cells had been generated, Maruyama et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>) found that memory B cells that could no longer bind the immunizing antigen had a lifespan comparable to that of memory B cells that had not switched receptor specificity. However, even though antigen occupancy is apparently not required for maintenance of memory B cells, the available data do not exclude the possibility that a BCR signal, presumably similar to that needed for the survival of naive B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>), is required for maintenance of memory B cells. Indeed, one of the explanations for the defective memory responses observed in mice harboring the tailless IgG1 BCR is that the cytoplasmic tail of IgG1 heavy chain contributes to maintenance and/or generation of memory B cells. In this regard, our results support this scenario and we propose that survival receptors, including the BCR, use PLC-&#x003b3;2 for the maintenance of memory B cells. Additional studies are underway to define the essential upstream receptors and the downstream targets of PLC-&#x003b3;2 that support the longevity of memory B cells.</p><p>Recall responses have been studied in several mutant mice defective in BCR signaling. Similar to our findings, the GC reaction in the primary response was diminished and the frequency of antigen-specific memory B cells was reduced 10-fold in Btk-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>). However, despite the drastic reduction in the number of Btk-deficient memory B cells, secondary exposure to antigen resulted in levels of serum IgG1 similar to those in the WT, which is in marked contrast to our results in PLC G1KO mice. The normal secondary IgG1 response in Btk-deficient mice could be the net outcome of positive and negative roles exerted by Btk in humoral immunity. Although Btk is a critical upstream regulator for PLC-&#x003b3;2 activation in the context of BCR signaling, it may have additional PLC-&#x003b3;2&#x02013;independent negative roles in B cell responses. Considering the fact that Btk is expressed in other type of immune cells, particularly in the myeloid lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>), it is also possible that Btk plays a positive role in B cells but a negative role in non-B cells that are required for productive secondary humoral immune responses. Indeed, it was recently demonstrated that Btk plays a role in TLR-induced IL-10 production, which in turn leads to inhibition of IL-6 secretion by antigen-presenting cells such as macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>). Similarly, elevated serum antibody titers in the recall response of BLNK-deficient mice could be accounted for by the multiple roles of BLNK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title/><sec><title>Mice and immunization.</title><p>PLC-&#x003b3;2<sup>f/f</sup> mice were generated as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref>).
