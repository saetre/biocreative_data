However, it has not been determined whether FAK also regulates the dynamics of invasive adhesions formed in cancer cells known as invadopodia. In this study, we report that endogenous FAK functions upstream of cellular Src (c-Src) as a negative regulator of invadopodia formation and dynamics in breast cancer cells. We show that depletion of FAK induces the formation of active invadopodia but impairs invasive cell migration. FAK-deficient MTLn3 breast cancer cells display enhanced assembly and dynamics of invadopodia that are rescued by expression of wild-type FAK but not by FAK that cannot be phosphorylated at tyrosine 397. Moreover, our findings demonstrate that FAK depletion switches phosphotyrosine-containing proteins from focal adhesions to invadopodia through the temporal and spatial regulation of c-Src activity. Collectively, our findings provide novel insight into the interplay between FAK and Src to promote invasion.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Efficient cancer cell migration through tissue barriers requires dynamic interactions between the ECM and the actin cytoskeleton as well as the capacity for matrix degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wolf and Friedl, 2006</xref>). A prominent feature of the cell migration machinery is the generation of organized adhesive structures. The most extensively characterized of these structures, focal adhesions, contain clusters of integrin receptors tethered to ends of actin stress fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schoenwaelder and Burridge, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carragher and Frame, 2004</xref>). Highly invasive cancer cells also form specialized actin-rich ECM-degrading membrane protrusions known as invadopodia, which, in contrast to focal adhesions, are primary sites of rapid actin polymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buccione et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yamaguchi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Linder, 2007</xref>). Significant progress has been made in characterizing the form and function of invadopodia, which are comprised of actin regulators such as Arp2/3, neural Wiscott-Aldrich syndrome protein, gelsolin, and cortactin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yamaguchi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Clark et al., 2007</xref>) and are dependent on Src kinase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Spinardi et al., 2004</xref>). Invadopodia also contain concentrated foci of matrix-degrading proteases such as matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Linder and Aepfelbacher, 2003</xref>). A stepwise model for invadopodia formation has been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Artym et al., 2006</xref>); however, the precise mechanisms that regulate invadopodia formation and dynamics are not well understood.</p><p>FAK is a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase that plays a central role in cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mitra et al., 2005</xref>). FAK has been shown to coordinate lamellipodial formation and focal adhesion turnover in fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Webb et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tilghman et al., 2005</xref>). Increased expression of FAK has been detected in metastatic tumors of the breast, prostate, colon, and brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Owens et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cance et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gabarra-Niecko et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lark et al., 2005</xref>). Recent evidence suggests that FAK may be involved in cancer progression, as FAK is required for ErbB2-mediated oncogenic transformation and invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Benlimame et al., 2005</xref>). Furthermore, mammary epithelial-specific disruption of FAK has been shown to block the transition to carcinoma formation in a mouse transgenic cancer model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lahlou et al., 2007</xref>). In addition, stable expression of the FAK-related nonkinase, an alternative transcript of FAK, has been shown to block mammary carcinoma lung metastases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">van Nimwegen et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>FAK promotes cell migration by its ability to bridge signals between integrin and growth factor receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sieg et al., 2000</xref>). Downstream of integrin or growth factor stimulation, FAK is cis- or trans-phosphorylated at Tyr-397, which provides a critical binding site for Src family kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schaller et al., 1994</xref>), the p85 regulatory subunit of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen and Guan, 1994</xref>), and phospholipase C&#x003b3; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhang et al., 1999</xref>). In particular, Src binding to Tyr-397 is important for phosphorylation of Tyr-576/577, which is important for full FAK activation. Subsequently, an activated FAK&#x02013;Src complex mediates the phosphorylation of multiple adhesion components involved in the dynamic regulation of cell motility, including p130Cas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tachibana et al., 1997</xref>) and paxillin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bellis et al., 1995</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we sought to determine whether FAK is involved in cell invasion through the regulation of invadopodia, which are thought to be responsible for the ability of cancer cells to degrade and invade through the matrix. Intriguingly, we find that depletion of FAK enhances the formation and dynamics of matrix-degrading invadopodia, which is rescued upon expression of wild-type FAK but not by expression of FAK that cannot be phosphorylated at Tyr-397. We demonstrate that enhanced invadopodia formation in FAK-depleted cells is not sufficient for cancer cell invasion. We also provide evidence that depletion of FAK expression regulates a switch from phosphotyrosine-containing proteins at focal adhesions to invadopodia via the spatial and temporal regulation of active Src. Together, our findings provide novel insight into the mechanism of FAK&#x02013;Src signaling in cancer cell invasion.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>FAK negatively regulates invadopodia formation and dynamics</title><p>Previous studies have demonstrated a critical role for FAK in regulating the turnover of focal adhesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Webb et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schober et al., 2007</xref>); however, a role for FAK in regulating the dynamics of invadopodia in cancer cells has not been characterized. MTLn3 mammary adenocarcinoma cells form invadopodia when plated on fibronectin or fibronectin-gelatin substrates, and the formation of these structures is thought to correlate with invasive capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yamaguchi et al., 2005</xref>). To generate FAK-deficient MTLn3 breast cancer cells, we used two independent siRNAs that depleted endogenous FAK by 80% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>) without affecting the expression of FAK-related proline-rich tyrosine kinase (Pyk2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lim et al., 2008</xref>). Invadopodia structures were identified in cells cultured on fibronectin-coated coverslips stained for the invadopodia markers cortactin and actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>). We unexpectedly found that FAK-deficient MTLn3 cells formed increased numbers of invadopodia on fibronectin, fibronectin-gelatin, and Matrigel surfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref> and unpublished data). We also observed increased invadopodia formation in FAK-deficient MDA-MB-231 human mammary adenocarcinoma cells (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200809110/DC1">Fig. S1</ext-link>) and SNB19 human glioblastoma cells (unpublished data), indicating that the ability of endogenous FAK to suppress invadopodia formation may be a general property of invasive cancer cells.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>FAK negatively regulates invadopodia formation and dynamics.</bold> (A) Cell lysates from MTLn3 cells transiently transfected with control siRNA (Ctlsi) or FAK siRNA (FAKsi A and FAKsi B) were analyzed by Western blotting and probed for FAK or Pyk2.

Live fluorescence imaging demonstrated that FAK-depleted cells formed invadopodia that were present for a shorter duration than those formed in control cells by &#x0223c;2 min (unpublished data). From plots of GFP-cortactin fluorescence intensities over time, we generated rate constants for net invadopodia assembly and disassembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 E</xref>). The rate of invadopodia assembly was significantly enhanced by twofold in FAK-deficient cells as compared with control cells. We also found modest increases in the rate of disassembly of invadopodia, indicating that invadopodia dynamics are enhanced in FAK-deficient breast cancer cells. Additionally, confocal microscopy revealed that invadopodia formed by FAK-deficient MTLn3 cells were still able to project vertically from the ventral membrane surface into a gelatin matrix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 F</xref>). Collectively, our results identify a novel role for endogenous FAK as a negative regulator of invadopodia formation and dynamics in breast cancer cells. These findings are especially intriguing in light of data demonstrating that depletion of FAK results in impaired focal adhesion dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Webb et al., 2004</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Enhanced invadopodia formation in FAK-deficient MTLn3 cells is not sufficient for invasion</title><p>Because the matrix-degrading function of invadopodia has been attributed to the focalized activity of MMPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen and Wang, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Artym et al., 2006</xref>), we examined whether the invadopodia formed in FAK-deficient MTLn3 cells retained their capacity to degrade the ECM. We cultured cells on fibronectin&#x02013;Alexa Fluor 568 gelatin substrates in the absence or presence of the pan-MMP inhibitor GM6001 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2, A and B</xref>). FAK-deficient MTLn3 cells displayed a threefold increase in the formation of active invadopodia associated with focal areas of matrix degradation as compared with control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>). The regions of matrix degradation formed in both control and FAK-deficient cells required the activity of MMPs because GM6001 impaired matrix degradation without affecting the formation of cortactin-containing puncta. To determine whether formation of invadopodia correlates with the invasive capacity of MTLn3 cancer cells, we assayed the ability of serum-starved MTLn3 cells to invade toward serum through Matrigel-coated membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 D</xref>). Invasion of MTLn3 control and FAK-deficient cells across Matrigel was impaired in the presence of GM6001, suggesting that the formation of functional invadopodia is necessary for Matrigel invasion. However, FAK-deficient cells, despite forming more active invadopodia, displayed substantially impaired Matrigel invasion as compared with control cells, demonstrating that enhanced formation of invadopodia in FAK-deficient cells is not sufficient to mediate invasive cell migration.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Enhanced invadopodia formation in FAK-deficient MTLn3 cells requires MMP activity but is not sufficient for invasion.</bold> (A) MTLn3 cells transiently transfected with control siRNA (Ctlsi) or FAK siRNA (FAKsi) were cultured on fibronectin&#x02013;Alexa Fluor 568 gelatin coverslips in the presence of DMSO vehicle control (&#x02212;GM6001) and stained with anticortactin antibody (green).

Treatment with FAK siRNA (which targets a sequence in the 5&#x02032; untranslated region of FAK) effectively reduced endogenous FAK expression without affecting the expression of GFP-FAK, GFP-FAK-Y397F, or GFP-FAK-K454R (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200809110/DC1">Fig. S2 A</ext-link>).

In accordance with these studies, FAK-deficient MTLn3 cells displayed enlarged vinculin-containing focal adhesions at the cell periphery, which is consistent with impaired focal adhesion disassembly in fibroblasts depleted of FAK (Fig. S2 B). This corresponded to a threefold reduction in transwell migration as compared with control cells expressing GFP (Fig. S2 C). Focal adhesion morphology and migration were restored in cells expressing GFP-FAK or GFP-FAK-K454R but not GFP-FAK-Y397F.

To determine whether FAK localizes to invadopodia in MTLn3 cells, we performed immunofluorescent cell staining in cells stably expressing GFP-FAK and visualized them by confocal microscopy (Fig. S2 D). We plated cells on fibronectin-gelatin coverslips and stained for vinculin, a known marker of focal adhesions, and Arp2/3, which is known to localize to invadopodia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yamaguchi et al., 2005</xref>). Z sectioning revealed that GFP-FAK and vinculin were localized to focal adhesions, and we did not detect the presence of vinculin or FAK in Arp2/3-containing invadopodia. These data indicate that the invadopodia formed by MTLn3 cells are morphologically distinct from podosomes, which contain vinculin-rich adhesive rings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buccione et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Oikawa et al., 2008</xref>). We were unable to stain for endogenous FAK, but we found that endogenous phosphorylated FAK at Tyr-397 localized with GFP-vinculin at focal adhesions but not cortactin-containing invadopodia (Fig. S2 E).

Accordingly, we found that the enhanced invadopodia formation observed in FAK-deficient cells required Src activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 B</xref>). To determine whether FAK functions upstream or downstream of Src, we examined invadopodia formation in MTLn3 cells stably expressing cellular Src (c-Src) or activated c-Src&#x02013;527F (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 C</xref>).

Additionally, we tested the localization of a phosphotyrosine reporter construct consisting of two tandem Src SH2 phosphotyrosine-binding domains (YFP-dSH2), which specifically detects tyrosine phosphorylation at focal adhesions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kirchner et al., 2003</xref>). YFP-dSH2 was strongly localized with phosphotyrosine at focal adhesions, but not invadopodia, in control cells. However, upon FAK depletion, phosphotyrosine staining at focal adhesions and YFP-dSH2 localization were severely impaired.

A previous study suggested that the localization and activity of Src could be regulated by association with FAK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schaller et al., 1999</xref>). Thus, we wanted to determine how FAK depletion impaired tyrosine phosphorylation of FAK&#x02013;Src substrates at focal adhesions but enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of substrates at invadopodia.

In this study, we describe a novel function for endogenous FAK in the regulation of invadopodia formation and dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Fig. 9</xref>). FAK-deficient MTLn3 breast cancer cells display enhanced dynamics of invadopodia that are rescued by expression of wild-type FAK but not by expression of FAK that cannot be phosphorylated at Tyr-397. Furthermore, we show that depletion of endogenous FAK by siRNA induces the formation of active invadopodia and mediates a switch from robust phosphotyrosine-containing proteins at focal adhesions to invadopodia through the spatial and temporal regulation of Src activity.

It appears that many of the signaling pathways that govern focal adhesion formation and disassembly also play roles in the regulation of invadopodia dynamics. For example, Src kinases and calpain proteases are important for the disassembly of both focal adhesions and podosome-type adhesions, including podosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Calle et al., 2006</xref>) and invadopodia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cortesio et al., 2008</xref>). Nevertheless, the mechanisms that regulate the formation of invadopodia and focal adhesions can be distinct. For example, Src kinase activity is necessary for the formation of podosome-type adhesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Spinardi et al., 2004</xref>), but its role in focal adhesion formation is less clear. Indeed, expression of constitutively active Src in cells that normally form focal adhesions promotes a switch to the formation of podosome-type adhesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gavazzi et al., 1989</xref>) and has been associated with a more invasive phenotype. Many cancer cells form both focal adhesions and invadopodia, but the molecular determinants that mediate the balance between formation of firm adhesive structures through focal adhesions and the generation of invasive matrix-degrading adhesion structures remain poorly understood.</p><p>Our findings suggest that FAK is poised to play a key role in regulating a dynamic interplay in signaling between focal adhesions and invadopodia during invasive cell migration. In accordance with a recent publication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Vitale et al., 2008</xref>), our data indicate that FAK is not necessary for the formation of invadopodia but instead can function to limit the formation of matrix-degrading invadopodia in cancer cells. However, our study is the first to show that depletion of endogenous FAK provides a critical switch between focal adhesion and invadopodia dynamics. We find that FAK depletion induces the formation of functional invadopodia in several different cancer cell lines, including MTLn3 and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells (Fig. S1) and SNB19 glioblastoma cells (unpublished data). Furthermore, our study presents a novel separation between enhanced generation of invadopodia and the invasive capacity of cancer cells. FAK-deficient MTLn3 cells showed impaired invasion across Matrigel-coated filters despite showing enhanced invadopodia formation on many different matrices including fibronectin, fibronectin-gelatin, and Matrigel (unpublished data). Although we found that MTLn3 invasion across Matrigel requires proteinase activity, enhanced matrix degradation alone is not sufficient for efficient tumor cell invasion in FAK-deficient cells. These findings suggest that FAK plays a complicated role in cancer cell invasion. It is intriguing to speculate that mechanisms that limit matrix degradation, through FAK or related pathways, may be necessary to optimize the matrix environment for invasive cell motility. This is an especially attractive hypothesis because FAK expression is associated with the invasive activity of human tumors and has been implicated in breast cancer progression and invasion in mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Owens et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cance et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gabarra-Niecko et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lark et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mitra et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lahlou et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>We have substantial evidence indicating that FAK functions upstream of c-Src to suppress invadopodia formation. For example, we found that endogenous FAK suppresses invadopodia formation in wild-type breast cancer cells and cells that overexpress wild-type c-Src. However, FAK siRNA had no effect on invadopodia formation in cells that express either active c-Src&#x02013;527F or transforming v-Src. In addition, expression of wild type but not Y397F-FAK, which abrogates Src binding, suppressed invadopodia formation in FAK-deficient cells. Interestingly, we observed partial effects in cells expressing kinase-inactive FAK, suggesting that the kinase activity of FAK may also contribute to the ability of FAK to suppress invadopodia formation. Collectively, our data demonstrate that phosphorylation of FAK at Tyr-397 is important for limiting invadopodia formation by FAK upstream of Src.</p><p>Previous studies have demonstrated that tyrosine phosphorylation is a critical mechanism by which focal adhesion dynamics are regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Crowley and Horwitz, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zamir et al., 1999</xref>). We found that tyrosine phosphorylation was decreased at focal adhesions but not at invadopodia in FAK-deficient MTLn3 cells. Furthermore, depletion of FAK resulted in enlarged peripheral focal adhesions and impaired localization and dynamics of a specific phosphotyrosine reporter at focal adhesions, which is consistent with previous reports of impaired focal adhesion disassembly in fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sieg et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Webb et al., 2004</xref>). In contrast, FAK-deficient cells displayed enhanced formation and dynamics of matrix-degrading invadopodia. Together, our data indicate that FAK is critical for tyrosine phosphorylation at focal adhesions and mediates a balance between tyrosine phosphorylation and dynamic turnover at invadopodia and focal adhesions.</p><p>It is interesting that although we find that FAK does not localize to invadopodia in MTLn3 cells, it is still able to modulate their formation and dynamics, implicating a common signaling mechanism that regulates focal adhesion and invadopodia dynamics. It has been proposed that FAK may be important for localized Src activity and phosphorylation of substrates that regulate cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schaller et al., 1999</xref>). In this context, our study is the first to demonstrate that depletion of FAK induces a redistribution of active Src from focal adhesions to invadopodia. Although we found that global Src activity is decreased, we observed a substantial increase in the number of invadopodia containing active Src in FAK-deficient cells. These findings suggest that FAK depletion induces a switch from focal adhesion initiation to invadopodia initiation through the spatial regulation of Src activity and localized tyrosine phosphorylation. Accordingly, depletion of FAK results in decreased tyrosine phosphorylation of p130Cas and paxillin at focal adhesions and enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of cortactin and Tks5/FISH at invadopodia. Our findings demonstrate that FAK is critical for localization of active Src to focal adhesions, and it will be important to determine what localizes and activates Src at invadopodia.</p><p>Interestingly, with the substrates we examined, we found that Tks5/FISH phosphorylation is substantially increased in FAK-deficient cells. In accordance with previous reports, we find that Tks5 is required for invadopodia/podosome formation in MTLn3 cells using RNAi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Seals et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Oikawa et al., 2008</xref>; unpublished data). It is intriguing to speculate that phosphorylation of Tks5 by Src may play a role in modulating the enhancement of invadopodia upon FAK depletion. Mapping the Src phosphorylation sites of Tks5 will be critical for addressing this hypothesis. However, it is unlikely that a single substrate will be sufficient to block the enhancement in invadopodia upon FAK depletion because Src targets multiple substrates involved in invadopodia and focal adhesion dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Luo et al., 2008</xref>). Collectively, our experiments provide novel insight into how FAK differentially modulates focal adhesion and invadopodia dynamics through the spatial and temporal regulation of localized c-Src activity.</p><p>Our findings demonstrate a novel role for FAK as a negative regulator of invadopodia formation and provide mechanistic insight into the dynamic regulation of adhesive structures involved in cell invasion.

A challenge for future investigation will be to elucidate the downstream mechanisms by which the FAK&#x02013;Src complex differentially regulates the balance between adhesive and degradative structures and to characterize their precise functions in vivo.</p></sec><sec sec-type="Materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Reagents and antibodies</title><p>Fibronectin was purified as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ruoslahti et al., 1982</xref>).

Images were captured into MetaVue (version 6.2; MDS Analytical Technologies) or MetaMorph imaging software (version 7.1; MDS Analytical Technologies). At least 40 cells were counted in each of at least three separate experiments performed on separate days. Dotlike structures containing cortactin and/or actin were scored as invadopodia. For ratiometric analysis, images were first subjected to high-pass filtration based on the water algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zamir et al., 1999</xref>) to remove diffuse background fluorescence. The images were thresholded based on the vinculin image because it had the largest signal to noise ratio, providing the clearest distinction between focal adhesions and background. The thresholded vinculin image was used to generate a binary image in which values at focal adhesions equal 1 and all other values equal 0. A ratio image of vinculin/pY416 Src was generated, and high frequency noise was removed with a low-pass filter. Ratio images were displayed with similar nucleocytoplasmic background as a control for possible differences in staining. Ratiometric images presented are representative of at least 50 cells visualized by immunofluorescence.</p></sec><sec><title>Fluorescent gelatin degradation assay</title><p>Alexa Fluor 568&#x02013;conjugated gelatin was prepared using the Alexa Fluor 568 protein labeling kit according to the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen).
