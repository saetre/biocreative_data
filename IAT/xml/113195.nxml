Genes that are transcriptionally regulated by octamer motifs can be either ubiquitously expressed or cell type specific. For example, the octamer motif is required for the ubiquitous expression of the small nuclear RNA (<italic>snRNA</italic>) genes, the cell cycle regulation of the histone <italic>H2B</italic> gene and the B cell-specific expression of immunoglobulin (<italic>Ig</italic>) genes (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf265c1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf265c4">4</xref>). The ability of the octamer motif to differentially regulate transcription is determined by the octamer binding proteins Oct-1 and Oct-2 (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf265c1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf265c4">4</xref>). Oct-1 and Oct-2 are members of the POU domain family of transcription factors (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf265c2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf265c3">3</xref>). The POU domain is a conserved bipartite DNA-binding domain consisting of two subdomains: a POU-specific domain (POU<sub>S</sub>) and a homedomain (POU<sub>H</sub>), separated by a flexible linker.</p><p>Oct-1 is ubiquitously expressed whereas Oct-2 expression is restricted to a small number of cell types, including B cells (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf265c1">1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf265c4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf265c6">6</xref>). The differential expression of some octamer-dependent genes can be explained partly by the interaction between octamer-binding proteins and promoter-selective co-activators that are themselves either cell type specific or ubiquitous. In the case of <italic>snRNA</italic> genes, ubiquitous expression is achieved by the association of Oct-1 with the SNAP<sub>c</sub> complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf265c7">7</xref>). B cell-restricted expression of <italic>Ig</italic> genes requires association of the B cell-specific co-activator OBF-1&#x0002f;OCA-B&#x0002f;Bob-1 (referred to here as OBF-1) with either Oct-1 or Oct-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf265c8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf265c12">12</xref>). Interaction of OBF-1 with Oct-1 or Oct-2 is mediated by direct contacts with their POU domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf265c9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf265c16">16</xref>). However, the formation of a stable complex is also determined by the specific sequence of the octamer element, suggesting that OBF-1 targets a subset of octamer-regulated genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf265c13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf265c16">16</xref>). In <italic>obf-1</italic><sup>&#x02013;&#x0002f;&#x02013;</sup> mice the two most obvious defects are the absence of germinal centres and a profound deficiency in serum Ig of secondary isotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf265c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf265c18">18</xref>).</p><p>The presence of Oct-1 in cell types that do not express Oct-2 suggests that Oct-1 determines the transcriptional activation of octamer-dependent genes in these cells. However, in B cells, where both Oct-1 and Oct-2 are present, it is not clear how each of these transcription factors targets individual octamer-dependent genes. Analysis of B cells in Oct-2-deficient mice demonstrated that whilst Oct-2 was dispensable for the antigen-independent phase of B cell differentiation, it was required for antigen-dependent differentiation and proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf265c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf265c20">20</xref>). These observations suggest that there are genes whose transcription cannot be activated by Oct-1 but which are critically dependent upon Oct-2. Analysis of the regulatory elements in Oct-2-specific genes should therefore reveal how Oct-2 can regulate genes that Oct-1 cannot.</p><p>The first bona fide Oct-2 target gene to be identified encodes the scavenger receptor, CD36. CD36 is expressed in a number of cell types in both humans and mice, including monocytes&#x0002f;macrophages, platelets and adipocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf265c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf265c22">22</xref>). However, CD36 expression in B cells appears to be specific to mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf265c21">21</xref>). Nevertheless, the expression of CD36 in mouse B cells is critically dependent upon Oct-2, and is therefore an ideal model to investigate Oct-2-specific transcriptional regulation in B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf265c21">21</xref>). The human CD36 promoter has been characterized and, consistent with the lack of expression of CD36 in human B cells, does not contain recognisable octamer elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf265c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf265c24">24</xref>). The promoter of the mouse CD36 gene has not been characterised previously and the mechanism by which Oct-2 regulates CD36 expression in mouse B cells remains to be elucidated. Moreover, of the small number of additional Oct-2 target genes that have since been identified, only the <italic>crisp-3</italic> and <italic>blr1</italic> promoters have been investigated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf265c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf265c26">26</xref>). Two low-affinity octamer sites in the <italic>crisp-3</italic> promoter mediate Oct-2-specific transcription of the <italic>crisp-3</italic> gene, whereas a single non-consensus octamer mediates the Oct-2-dependent transcriptional activation of the <italic>blr1</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf265c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf265c26">26</xref>).</p><p>In order to determine how Oct-2 mediates expression of CD36 in B cells, we cloned and analysed the mouse CD36 promoter. In contrast to the human CD36 promoter, the mouse promoter contains a consensus octamer element of the type ATGCTAAT. This octamer element can be bound by either Oct-1 or Oct-2 but requires the expression of Oct-2 to activate transcription in B cells. Mutation of the octamer element renders the CD36 promoter refractory to activation by Oct-2. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the CD36 octamer element does not support recruitment of OBF-1 and that CD36 expression is unaffected in primary B cells derived from <italic>obf-1</italic><sup>&#x02013;&#x0002f;&#x02013;</sup> mice. We conclude that Oct-2 activates CD36 gene expression in mouse B cells via the octamer element in the promoter. Our data also demonstrate that CD36 is the first example of an Oct-2-dependent gene whose expression in B cells is independent of OBF-1. These findings support the notion that Oct-2 regulates gene transcription by both OBF-1-dependent and -independent mechanisms.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cloning of the mouse CD36 promoter</title><p>The mouse CD36 promoter sequence was cloned using the mouse Promoter Finder DNA Walking kit according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions (Clontech).

The sequences of the gene-specific primers were CD36GSP1, 5&#x02032;-ACCATCCACCAGTTGCTCCACACATTTCAG-3&#x02032; and CD36GSP2, 5&#x02032;-GGCAGCTGTGAAGAAGAAAAAGTCCTCAGT-3&#x02032;. A single &#x0223c;600 bp PCR product from the secondary reactions was ligated directly into the T-vector pT7blue (Novagen). Nine of the clones were sequenced and found to have identity with the published human CD36 promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf265c27">27</xref>). One of these clones was subsequently used as a probe to obtain larger genomic clones from a 129&#x0002f;Sv mouse genomic library in Lambda FIX II (Stratagene) using standard hybridisation protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf265c28">28</xref>). A single positive genomic clone of &#x0223c;19 kb was obtained and partially sequenced by the dideoxy chain termination method.

The octamer site in pGLCD36 was mutated using a two-step PCR protocol as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf265c29">29</xref>).

However, the sequence of the mouse promoter has not been reported and the molecular basis of Oct-2-dependent CD36 expression has not been elucidated. We therefore used the published sequence of the mouse CD36 cDNA to design PCR primers to amplify genomic DNA upstream of the start of the known cDNA sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf265c27">27</xref>).

Restriction mapping and partial sequencing revealed that a single clone contained a 19 kb genomic fragment extending &#x0223c;3.5 kb upstream from the cDNA sequence (data not shown). The region upstream of the cDNA was sequenced and aligned with the reported human CD36 promoter (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf265f1">1</xref>A).

Both Oct-1 and Oct-2 formed complexes with the CD36 probe (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf265f2">2</xref>A, lanes 2 and 3). When Oct-1 or Oct-2 was incubated with the analogous probe containing a mutated octamer site (CD36mOct), no specific complexes were observed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf265f2">2</xref>A, lanes 5 and 6). Binding of Oct-1 and Oct-2 to the consensus octamer sequence (V<sub>H</sub>Oct) is also shown (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf265f2">2</xref>A, lanes 8 and 9). The results demonstrate that both Oct-1 and Oct-2 are able to bind specifically to the octamer site in the CD36 promoter.</p><p>It is well established that when B cell nuclear extracts are incubated with an octamer element only complexes containing Oct-1 and Oct-2 are observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf265c1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf265c6">6</xref>). We therefore performed a competition analysis to test the ability of the CD36 octamer (CD36 Oct) to abolish Oct-1- and Oct-2-specific complexes that form on the known octamer site from the IgK enhancer (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf265f2">2</xref>B). When nuclear extracts from the B cell line WEHI231 were incubated with the IgK octamer in the absence of competitor DNA, both Oct-1- and Oct-2-specific complexes were observed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf265f2">2</xref>B, lane 1). In the presence of 100-fold molar excess of CD36 octamer both complexes were abolished. In contrast, both complexes were unaffected by the presence of mutated CD36 octamer DNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf265f2">2</xref>B, lane 2). When the CD36 octamer DNA was used as a radiolabelled probe, two complexes were also observed that were completely abolished in the presence of excess IgK Oct competitor DNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf265f2">2</xref>C, lanes 1 and 4). In contrast, competition with the mutated CD36 octamer DNA did not abolish binding. Taken together, the results clearly indicate that the octamer element in the CD36 promoter can be bound by endogenous Oct-1 and Oct-2.</p><p>To establish unequivocally that endogenous Oct-2 is able to bind to the CD36 octamer, supershift analysis using an Oct-2-specific antibody was performed. In the presence of an Oct-2-specific antibody the lower mobility complex was abolished and an additional supershifted complex appeared (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf265f2">2</xref>C, lane 6). Addition of serum alone did not abolish the Oct-2 complex nor produce a supershifted complex (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf265f2">2</xref>C, lane 5). The results demonstrate clearly that endogenous Oct-2 can bind to the octamer element in the CD36 promoter.</p></sec><sec><title>Oct-2 activates the CD36 promoter in B cells</title><p>To investigate the ability of Oct-2 to activate CD36 transcription the CD36 promoter was ligated upstream of the <italic>luciferase</italic> cDNA in the reporter plasmid pGL2-B to produce pGLCD36. In order to examine the role of Oct-2 in regulating the B cell expression of CD36 we used the pre-B cell line Abl&#x0002f;Oct-2-ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf265c21">21</xref>). This cell line was derived from the mouse <italic>oct-2</italic><sup>&#x02013;&#x0002f;&#x02013;</sup> pre-B&#x000a0;cell line Abl1.1 by stable transfection of a construct expressing Oct-2 fused to the hormone-binding domain of the human estrogen receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf265c21">21</xref>). The specific effect of Oct-2 in a B cell can therefore be determined by the addition of &#x003b2;-estradiol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf265c21">21</xref>). Indeed, the endogenous transcription of the CD36 gene in this cell line is dependent upon &#x003b2;-estradiol activation of Oct-2 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf265f3">3</xref>A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf265c21">21</xref>). Abl1.1 and Abl1.1&#x0002f;Oct-2-ER cells were transfected with the CD36 reporter plasmid pGLCD36 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf265f3">3</xref>B). After transfection, the cells were divided into two separate cultures and one was stimulated by the addition of &#x003b2;-estradiol. In the <italic>oct-2</italic><sup>&#x02013;&#x0002f;&#x02013;</sup> cells, addition of &#x003b2;-estradiol had no effect on the activity of the CD36 promoter (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf265f3">3</xref>B, Abl1.1). In contrast, addition of &#x003b2;-estradiol to Abl&#x0002f;Oct-2-ER cells resulted in activation of the CD36 promoter (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf265f3">3</xref>B, CD36). This is consistent with the activation of the endogenous CD36 gene as determined by northern blot analysis of mRNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf265f3">3</xref>A). To determine that the activation was dependent upon the octamer site, we introduced specific mutations that abolish Oct-2 binding to the octamer. When the octamer sequence was mutated, addition of &#x003b2;-estradiol almost totally blocked activation in Abl1.1&#x0002f;Oct-2-ER cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf265f4">4</xref>, mOct). The results demonstrate clearly that the octamer site in the CD36 promoter mediates its Oct-2-dependent activation.</p></sec><sec><title>Expression of CD36 in B cells requires Oct-2 but not OBF-1</title><p>OBF-1 activates transcription of octamer-containing promoters by binding directly to either Oct-1 or Oct-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf265c8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf265c16">16</xref>). Previous studies have shown that OBF-1 recruitment is dependent upon the presence of adenosine at position five in the octamer sequence (ATGC<bold>A</bold>AAT) and that octamers with thymine at this position (ATGC<bold>T</bold>AAT) do not form a ternary complex with OBF-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf265c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf265c14">14</xref>). The CD36 octamer is of the type ATGC<bold>T</bold>AAT, suggesting that it cannot support recruitment of OBF-1. We have demonstrated that both Oct-1 and Oct-2 can bind to the CD36 octamer element but that no significant transcriptional activity was detectable in <italic>oct-2</italic><sup>&#x02013;&#x0002f;&#x02013;</sup> B cells despite the high level of Oct-1 in these cells. Oct-1 is a weak activator of mRNA genes and therefore requires the presence of a co-activator to achieve efficient transcriptional activation (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf265c2">2</xref>). We therefore tested the ability of the CD36 octamer to form a ternary complex with OBF-1 in a gel retardation assay (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf265f5">5</xref>A). The Oct-2 POU domain was used in order to clearly resolve the ternary complex. OBF-1 forms a ternary complex with the Oct-2 POU domain on the V<sub>H</sub>Oct site (ATGCTAAAT) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf265f5">5</xref>A, lane 3). In contrast, when the CD36 octamer was used as a probe, OBF-1 did not form a ternary complex (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf265f5">5</xref>A, lane 7). This result demonstrates that OBF-1 is excluded from the CD36 promoter and is unlikely to participate in Oct-2 transcriptional activation of the CD36 gene. To confirm that CD36 expression in B cells is independent of OBF-1 expression, we investigated the expression of CD36 in mouse primary B cells. The requirement for OBF-1 was investigated by examining the expression of CD36 by RT&#x02013;PCR using RNA from mature primary B cells derived from wild-type, <italic>oct-2</italic><sup>&#x02013;&#x0002f;&#x02013;</sup> and <italic>obf-1</italic><sup>&#x02013;&#x0002f;&#x02013;</sup> mice (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf265f5">5</xref>B). In agreement with a previous report, comparison of CD36 expression in the wild-type and <italic>oct-2</italic><sup>&#x02013;&#x0002f;&#x02013;</sup> cells clearly demonstrated the lack of CD36 expression in the <italic>oct-2</italic><sup>&#x02013;&#x0002f;&#x02013;</sup> cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf265f5">5</xref>B, panel 2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf265c21">21</xref>). In contrast, CD36 is expressed in <italic>obf-1</italic><sup>&#x02013;&#x0002f;&#x02013;</sup> splenic B cells to equivalent levels seen in the wild-type cells. Expression of OBF-1 is unaffected in <italic>oct-2</italic><sup>&#x02013;&#x0002f;&#x02013;</sup> B&#x000a0;cells, suggesting that the lack of CD36 expression in <italic>oct-2</italic><sup>&#x02013;&#x0002f;&#x02013;</sup> cells is not due to the absence of OBF-1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkf265f5">5</xref>B panel 2; compare <italic>OBF-1</italic><sup>&#x02013;&#x0002f;&#x02013;</sup> with <italic>oct-2</italic><sup>&#x02013;&#x0002f;&#x02013;</sup>). Taken together the data demonstrate that the Oct-2-dependent expression of CD36 in B&#x000a0;cells is independent of the co-activator OBF-1.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><sec><title>Comparison of the mouse and human CD36 promoters</title><p>The conservation of transcription factor binding sites in the human and mouse CD36 promoters suggests that they are likely to be important in the regulation of CD36 gene expression in both mice and humans. The perfect conservation of the DR-1 element suggests that the PPAR&#x003b3;:RXR&#x003b1; complex regulates CD36 gene expression in mouse macrophages by the same mechanism as in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf265c36">36</xref>). The AML1 site in the human gene is required for constitutive promoter activity in monocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf265c24">24</xref>) and conservation of this sequence in the mouse promoter also suggests that it has a similar function in the mouse. The binding sites for the ubiquitous transcription factor NF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf265c37">37</xref>) could also be important in regulation of CD36 gene expression.</p><p>The consensus octamer site in the mouse promoter is not conserved in the human promoter. This correlates with the fact that CD36 is expressed in mouse primary B cells but has not been reported in human primary B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf265c21">21</xref>). However, it is possible that CD36 is expressed in human B cells under some circumstances and that an Oct-2 binding site exists elsewhere in the human CD36 gene, as CD36 expression in human lymphoma cells has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf265c38">38</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Oct-2-dependent transcription</title><p>The mouse CD36 gene was the first gene to be identified as an Oct-2 target gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf265c21">21</xref>) and our finding that the promoter contains a consensus octamer site provides a molecular explanation for the Oct-2-dependent expression of CD36 in B cells. <italic>In vitro</italic>, this octamer site can recruit either Oct-1 or Oct-2, but B cell-specific expression of CD36 <italic>in vivo</italic> is critically dependent upon Oct-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf265c21">21</xref>; this study). Our analysis of the CD36 promoter activity demonstrated that octamer-dependent transcription requires the expression of Oct-2 and that the endogenous Oct-1 was insufficient.</p></sec><sec><title>OBF-1 is not required for CD36 transcription</title><p>Our investigation of OBF-1 in the regulation of CD36 gene expression showed that Oct-2 is unable to recruit OBF-1 to the CD36 octamer <italic>in vitro</italic> and that expression of CD36 in primary B cells from <italic>obf-1</italic><sup>&#x02013;&#x0002f;&#x02013;</sup> mice is unaffected. The regulation of CD36 transcription in B cells therefore appears to be dependent upon Oct-2 but not OBF-1, demonstrating that OBF-1 is not a prerequisite for transcriptional regulation by Oct-2. This is in contrast to the regulation of the <italic>blr1</italic> gene whose promoter can be stimulated by OBF-1 and whose expression is &#x0003e;50&#x00025; reduced in <italic>obf-1</italic><sup>&#x02013;&#x0002f;&#x02013;</sup> B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf265c26">26</xref>). The octamer sequence in the mouse <italic>blr1</italic> gene is AAACAAAT and can presumably support Oct-2-dependent recruitment of OBF-1, although this has not been demonstrated. Other studies have shown that OBF-1 recruitment is dependent upon the presence of adenosine at position five in the octamer sequence (ATGC<bold>A</bold>AAT) and that mutation to a thymine (ATGC<bold>T</bold>AAT) prevents ternary complex formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf265c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf265c14">14</xref>). The CD36 octamer is of the type ATGC<bold>T</bold>AAT, suggesting that the presence of thymine at position 5 in the CD36 octamer discriminates between Oct-2 and an Oct factor&#x0002f;OBF-1 complex. It therefore appears that Oct-2 can specifically exclude OBF-1 from the regulation of some genes whilst actively recruiting it to regulate others, depending on the nature of the octamer. This is supported by a comparison of the phenotypes of the <italic>oct-2</italic><sup>&#x02013;&#x0002f;&#x02013;</sup> and <italic>obf-1</italic><sup>&#x02013;&#x0002f;&#x02013;</sup> mice, which both show severely reduced numbers of mature B cells and low levels of secondary antibody isotypes in serum. However, only B cells from the <italic>oct-2</italic><sup>&#x02013;&#x0002f;&#x02013;</sup> mice are unable to proliferate normally when stimulated with anti-IgM or T cell-independent mitogens. Therefore, these overlapping, yet distinct, phenotypes support the idea that Oct-2 regulates gene expression by OBF-1-dependent and -independent mechanisms.</p></sec><sec><title>A possible mechanism to evade Oct-1 regulation</title><p>Members of a given transcription factor family often possess identical or overlapping DNA-binding specificities. Therefore, a complete understanding of transcription factor function must address the question of how transcription factors with the same DNA-binding specificity target different genes within the same cell. We have investigated how a single gene can be specifically regulated by the transcription factor Oct-2 but escapes the control of Oct-1, which has an identical DNA-binding specificity. Oct-1 is a weak activator of mRNA genes and therefore requires the presence of a co-activator to achieve efficient transcriptional activation (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf265c2">2</xref>). The fact that Oct-1 requires an additional co-activator such as VP16 or OBF-1 to stimulate transcription from mRNA promoters (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkf265c2">2</xref>) suggests that exclusion of OBF-1 from the CD36 promoter by use of the ATGCTAAT sequence renders the CD36 gene refractory to Oct-1 transcriptional activation.</p><p>In summary, our analysis of the mouse CD36 promoter has revealed that Oct-2 regulates the transcription of the CD36 gene by directly binding to an octamer site located in the promoter. The octamer sequence is of a type that excludes the recruitment of OBF-1 whilst maintaining high affinity Oct-2 binding, thus providing a possible mechanism to enable CD36 expression to evade Oct-1 regulation.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkf265f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Sequence alignment of the mouse and human CD36 proximal promoters.
