This study investigated the cross-talk that influences intracellular signaling and gene expression profiling in response to co-activation of the EP2 and FP prostanoid receptors in Ishikawa cells stably expressing both receptors (FPEP2 cells). In this study we show that in FPEP2 cells, PGF alone does not alter adenosine 3&#x02032;,5&#x02032;-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) production, but in combination with Butaprost enhances EP2 receptor mediated cAMP release compared to treatment with Butaprost alone. PGF-mediated potentiation of cAMP release was abolished by antagonism of the FP receptor, inhibition of phospholipase C (PLC) and inositol phosphate receptor (IP3R) whereas inhibition of protein kinase C (PKC) had no effect. Moreover, inhibition of calcium effectors using calmodulin antagonist (W7) or Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMK-II) inhibitor (KN-93) abolished PGF potentiation of Butaprost-mediated cAMP release. Using siRNA molecules targeted against the adenylyl cyclase 3 (AC3) isoform, we show that AC3 is responsible for the cross-talk between the FP and EP2 receptors. Using gene array studies we have identified a candidate gene, Spermidine/N1-acetyltransferase (SAT1), which is regulated by this cAMP mediated cross-talk. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that co-activation of the FP and EP2 receptors results in enhanced release of cAMP via FP receptor-G&#x003b1;<sub>q</sub>-Ca<sup>2+</sup>-calmodulin pathway by activating calcium sensitive AC3 isoform.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Abbreviations</title><kwd>COX, cyclooxygenase</kwd><kwd>DMEM, Dulbecco's modified eagle medium</kwd><kwd>DMSO, dimethylsulphoxide</kwd><kwd>EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor</kwd><kwd>ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase</kwd><kwd>GPCR, G protein-coupled receptor</kwd><kwd>IBMX, 3-isobutyl-1-methyl xanthine</kwd><kwd>PBS, phosphate buffered saline</kwd><kwd>RT, reverse transcriptase</kwd><kwd>SAT1, Spermidine/N1-acetyltransferase</kwd><kwd>siRNA, small interfering RNA</kwd><kwd>VEGF, vascular endothelial growth factor</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Prostaglandin</kwd><kwd>Adenylyl cyclase</kwd><kwd>cAMP</kwd><kwd>SAT1</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p>Prostaglandins exert paracrine and autocrine effects on target cells by coupling to their specific GPCRs and activate intracellular signaling. PGE<sub>2</sub> and PGF<sub>2&#x003b1;</sub> (PGF) are the most abundantly biosynthesized prostaglandins and are major metabolites of cyclooxygenase (COX) enzymes in the human endometrium <xref rid="bib1 bib2" ref-type="bibr">[1,2]</xref>. Furthermore, COX enzyme expression, prostaglandins synthesis and their cognate receptors expression (mainly EP2 and FP) are dysregulated in endometrial adenocarcinoma <xref rid="bib3 bib4 bib5" ref-type="bibr">[3&#x02013;5]</xref>.</p><p>EP2 and FP receptors are often co-expressed in the same cells and use different intracellular signaling pathways. EP2 receptors couple to G&#x003b1;<sub>s,</sub> resulting in increased formation of cAMP, while FP receptors couple to G&#x003b1;<sub>q</sub> which in turn results in release of inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate (IP) and dialcylglycerol (DAG) <xref rid="bib1 bib6 bib7 bib8" ref-type="bibr">[1,6&#x02013;8]</xref>. cAMP is generated in cells from adenosine triphosphate (ATP) by the enzymatic activity of the adenylyl cyclase (AC) family members. There are multiple AC isoforms (9 membrane-bound and 1 soluble) with different amino acid sequence, tissue distribution and regulation. AC isoforms are named from AC1 to AC9 in the order of their publication <xref rid="bib9 bib10" ref-type="bibr">[9,10]</xref>. Difference in regulation of these isoforms includes sensitivity to calcium, G proteins (G&#x003b1;<sub>i</sub> and G<sub>&#x003b2;&#x003b3;</sub>), protein kinases (PKA, PKC, calmodulin and calmodulin-kinase) and phosphatases (calcineurin). Out of the ten AC isoforms three (AC1, AC3 and AC8) are calcium stimulated while AC5 and AC6 are normally inhibited by calcium <italic>in vivo</italic><xref rid="bib10 bib11" ref-type="bibr">[10,11]</xref>. The intracellular calcium pathway has been shown to play a significant part in G&#x003b1;<sub>s</sub>&#x02013;G&#x003b1;<sub>q</sub> cross-talk by regulating calcium sensitive AC isoforms <xref rid="bib12 bib13 bib14" ref-type="bibr">[12&#x02013;14]</xref>. For example, Ostrom et al. <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref> showed a potentiation of &#x003b2;-adrenergic (&#x003b2;-AR) receptor induced cAMP production by activation of angiotensin II (ANG-II) receptor coupled to G&#x003b1;<sub>q</sub> protein through calcium/calmodulin pathway demonstrating cross-talk between ANG-II and &#x003b2;-AR receptors in cardiac fibroblasts cells.</p><p>GPCR cross-talk in the eicosaniod family has been shown in several studies. Walsh and Kinsella <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> showed a cross-talk between thromboxane A<sub>2</sub> (TP&#x003b1; and TP&#x003b2;) and EP1 receptors in HEK 293 cells that leads to desensitization and inhibition of signaling of the TP receptors in a PKC-dependent manner. The same group further indentified that the activation of the FP receptor by PGF can also mediate desensitization of the TP&#x003b1; and TP&#x003b2; receptors via the PKC pathway <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. In another study, Wilson et al. <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> showed that heterodimerzation can occur between the human receptors for prostacyclin (IP) and TP&#x003b1; that leads to augmentation of TP&#x003b1; receptors-mediated accumulation of cAMP by IP receptors when they are co-expressed in a HEK 293 cell line.</p><p>Since EP2 and FP receptors are co-expressed in endometrial adenocarcinoma cells <xref rid="bib7 bib18" ref-type="bibr">[7,18]</xref>, this study investigated the cross-talk that may influence intracellular signaling and target gene activation in response to co-activation of EP2 and FP receptors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><label>2.1</label><title>Reagents</title><p>All chemicals used were molecular biology grade and were obtained from Sigma (Dorset, UK or RSA) or IBI (Cambridge, UK).

However, to our knowledge there have been no studies addressing the integrative signaling effects of the EP2 and FP receptors on signal transduction and gene expression. Here we show for the first time that co-activation of prostanoid receptors can alter the gene expression profile in endometrial adenocarcinoma cells stably expressing the EP2 and FP receptors. In addition to our knowledge this is the first study to investigate the cross-talk between the EP2 and FP receptors and the molecular mechanism underlying the intracellular signaling pathway in response to co-activation of both receptors.</p><p>In order to investigate prostanoid integrative signaling, we stably transfected the EP2 receptor into Ishikawa cells stably expressing the FP receptor. Expression level of the EP2 receptor in FPEP2 cells was compared to the parental FPS32 cells using quantitative real-time RT-PCR, Western blot analysis and immunofluorescence microscopy confirming stable expression of EP2 receptor in FPEP2 cells localised to the perinuclear and plasma membrane. Introduction of the EP2 receptor had no effect on the expression profile of the other E-series receptors and of FP receptor which could be activated by prostanoid ligands in our study. Furthermore, the functionality of EP2 and FP receptors was also confirmed by the release of their respective secondary messengers, cAMP and IP in the presence of their respective ligands.</p><p>Using the FPEP2 cells as a model system, we showed that Butaprost stimulation of FPEP2 cells gave a robust intracellular accumulation of cAMP while PGF-mediated FP receptor activation by its own had no effect on cAMP production. Interestingly we found that PGF could significantly enhance the cAMP accumulation in combination with Butaprost. Using specific receptor antagonists and small molecule chemical inhibitors of cell signaling we dissected the signaling pathways mediating the PGF-induced augmentation of cAMP in cells treated with the combination of ligands and have shown that the PGF-enhancement of cAMP observed in FPEP2 cells treated with Butaprost and PGF was induced via the FP receptor-G&#x003b1;<sub>q</sub>-mediated activation of IP via PLC. Following its release IP could activate its receptors (IPR) present on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane to promote intracellular calcium release and activation of calmodulin and CaMK-II as depicted schematically in <xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;5</xref>.

In order to determine the integrative effects of receptor co-activation on gene expression, we performed whole genome array profiling in FPEP2 cells in response to Butaprost, PGF or the combination of Butaprost and PGF. Co-activation of FPEP2 cells with Butaprost and PGF enhanced or repressed a set of Butaprost (EP2 receptor) regulated genes. Analysis of the gene list for Gene Ontology annotations indicated functions in cellular metabolism, immune response and excretion. One of the genes identified, SAT1 is an important enzyme in polyamine metabolism, adding an acetyl group to aminopropyl ends of spermidine and spermine <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>.
