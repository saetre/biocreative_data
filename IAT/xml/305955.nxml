We have investigated the structural relationship of heat-inducible and cognate members of the human hsp70 gene family. Among several human genomic clones isolated using Drosophila hsp/hsc70 probes, one contained an hsc70 gene. Its complete sequence is reported here. It is split by eight introns and encodes a predicted protein of 70899 d that would be 81% homologous to hsp70. Structural comparisons with corresponding genes from other species provide one of the most striking examples of gene conservation. Isolation of a corresponding cDNA clone, RNA-mapping and in vitro translation data demonstrate that the gene is expressed constitutively and directs the synthesis of a 71 kd protein. The latter is very likely to be identical to a clathrin uncoating ATPase recently identified as a member of the hsp70-like protein family.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00257-0197-a" xlink:role="5186"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00257-0198-a" xlink:role="5187"/></fig><fig id="F3"><graphic xlink:href="nar00257-0202-a" xlink:role="5191"/></fig><fig id="F4"><graphic xlink:href="nar00257-0203-a" xlink:role="5192"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00257-0192.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5181"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00257-0193.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5182"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00257-0194.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5183"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00257-0195.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5184"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00257-0196.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5185"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00257-0197.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5186"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00257-0198.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5187"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00257-0199.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5188"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00257-0200.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5189"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00257-0201.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5190"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00257-0202.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5191"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00257-0203.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5192"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00257-0204.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5193"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00257-0205.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5194"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00257-0206.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5195"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00257-0207.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5196"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00257-0208.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="5197"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
