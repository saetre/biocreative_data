Using a well-established two-stage chemical carcinogenesis model, we investigated the temporal and spatial changes in expression of those Cldns that we have previously demonstrated to be important in epidermal differentiation and the formation of the epidermal permeability barrier, i.e., Cldn1, Cldn6, Cldn11, Cldn12 and Cldn18.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The lower dorsal backskin of mice was treated topically with 7,12-dimethylbenz(<italic>a</italic>)anthracene (DMBA; 0.25 mg/ml in acetone) and following a 10-day incubation period, 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA; 25 &#x003bc;g/ml in acetone) was applied three times a week to the same area.

Specifically, in the early stages of DMBA/TPA treatment, the suprabasal-specific Cldns occupy an expanded zone of expression corresponding to an increased number of suprabasal epidermal cell layers. As tumorigenesis progressed, the number of suprabasal epidermal layers positive for Cldn6, Cldn11, Cldn12 and Cldn18 was reduced, especially in the lower strata of the expanded suprabasal zone. In addition, a variably reduced cell membrane association of those differentiation-specific Cldns was observed, especially within the infiltrating epidermal structures. In contrast, Cldn1 (which is normally expressed in all the living layers of the epidermis) remained restricted to the cell membrane throughout the tumorigenesis protocol. However commencing 2 weeks after treatment there was a marked decrease in the number of Cldn1-positive basal cells, and the zone of Cldn1-null epidermal cells was expanded up into the lower stratified epidermis throughout the progression of DMBA/TPA treatment. In addition, there was no Cldn1 localization in the infiltrating epidermal structures of the tumorigenic epidermis.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This is the first demonstration of the changes in Cldn expression in the progression of DMBA/TPA-induced skin tumors; however further investigation into the molecular mechanisms regulating the observed changes in barrier selectivity during tumorigenesis is required.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Disruption of epithelial cell polarity and cell-cell junctions with concomitant changes in the expression of junctional proteins during primary tumor formation is considered to be a hallmark of cancer cell invasion and metastasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Amongst the junctional complexes, the role in tumor formation of specific tight junction (TJ) proteins essential for cell polarity and the formation and maintenance of heterogeneous permeability barriers is not well understood. In vivo studies have demonstrated that the epidermis is characterized by a defined differentiation-dependent expression of Claudins (Cldns), a family of tetraspan membrane proteins that comprise a major component of TJ fibrils essential to the structure and function of TJs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Recent studies have also shown that changes in the distribution pattern of diverse Cldns may contribute to changes observed in cell permeability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. However, no systematic analysis of the expression and/or localization of various Cldns during skin tumorigenesis is yet available.</p><p>Understanding the molecular basis of skin tumor development has been greatly facilitated by the use of animal model systems in which tumor development can be carefully controlled [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. For example, the classical mouse two-stage carcinogenesis model provides an excellent system in which to study the stages and molecular mechanisms involved in squamous cell carcinoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The chemical carcinogenesis process can be divided into three distinct phases: initiation, promotion and progression. Initiation results from exposure to a mutagenic carcinogen, followed by the application of a promoter to alter gene expression and increase cell proliferation to ultimately result in tumor formation. Therefore, we used this model to elucidate the changes occurring in Cldn expression during the progression of epithelial tumors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>DMBA/TPA treatment</title><p>The coat on the dorsal side of one-month-old CD1 wild type mice was shaved one day prior to the initiation of the experimental protocol and mice were shaved once a week as required until the coat failed to re-grow. The lower dorsal backskin of mice was treated topically with 7,12-dimethylbenz(<italic>a</italic>)anthracene (DMBA; 0.25 mg/ml in acetone) and following a 10-day incubation period, 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA; 25 &#x003bc;g/ml in acetone) was applied three times a week to the same area. Experimental results were highly reproducible in three independent assays, each comprising three mice per time point (treated vs. control) and a minimum of 2&#x02013;3 biopsies per mouse. All animal studies were conducted according to the regulations of the Canadian Council on Animal Care.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample Collection</title><p>Backskin samples (~1 cm<sup>2</sup>) were dissected from the lesion and/or tumor regions of the mid-dorsal backskin from DMBA/TPA-treated mice as well as their vehicle-treated controls; sampling was done 2, 4, 6, 8 and 12 weeks after the initiation of the experimental protocol. Since the fixation method routinely used in our laboratory is rather stringent (see below) and not appropriate for all antibodies, frozen sections were required for Cldn1, Ki67 and CD3 immunostaining [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. All other immunolocalization and histology (Hematoxylin &#x00026; Eosin; H&#x00026;E) were performed on paraffin sections. For frozen sections: skin samples were embedded in HistoPrep&#x02122; and solidified in dry ice-chilled isopentane. Sections (5 &#x003bc;m) on slides were warmed at room temperature for 3 minutes, and then fixed for 10 minutes in methanol at -20&#x000b0;C, followed by washing in PBS prior to immunostaining. For paraffin sections: skin samples were fixed for 12&#x02013;16 hours in Bouin's fixative (75% saturated picric acid, 20% formaldehyde and 5% glacial acetic acid) at room temperature, followed by ethanol dehydration (30%, 50%, 70%, 95%, 100%), paraffin embedding and sectioning (5 &#x003bc;m).

Primary antibodies appropriately diluted in incubation buffer (1% goat serum, 0.8% BSA, 1% gelatin in PBS) were applied for 1&#x02013;2 hours at room temperature; antibodies against the following were used: Ki67 (1:25) (cat. # ab833; abcam, Cambridge, MA), CD3 (1:100) (cat. # 555273; BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ), Cldn6 (1:50) (custom antibody generated from hen #3677 against mouse Cldn6 sequence-CYSTSVPHSRGPSEYPTKNYV, Aves Labs, Inc., San Diego, CA), Cldn11 (1:50) (custom antibody generated from hen #3680 against mouse Cldn11 sequence-CRKMDELGSK, Aves Labs, Inc.), Cldn12 (1:50) (custom antibody generated from hen #5186 against mouse Cldn12 sequence-CZRKLRLITFNRNEKNLTIYT, Aves Labs, Inc.), Cldn18 (1:50) (custom antibody generated from rabbit #A9953 against mouse Cldn18 sequence-CRTEDDEQSHPTKYDYV, Open Biosystems, Huntsville AL) and Cldn1 (6:100) (cat. #71&#x02013;7800; Invitrogen, Burlington, Canada).

Initiation with DMBA followed by 2 to 12 weeks of TPA treatment caused the epidermis progressively to display abnormalities in morphological architecture consistent with tumor formation, including a much thicker suprabasal compartment, an expanded stratum corneum and a more dispersed granular layer (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b&#x02013;e</xref>). In addition, characteristic invaginations of epidermal structures into the dermis were evident (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1c&#x02013;e</xref>), as were pseudohorn cysts (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1c&#x02013;d</xref>, marked with stars); a photograph depicting the dorsal side of the DMBA/TPA-treated mouse after 12 weeks is shown (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1f</xref>).

The distribution of Cldn6, Cldn11, Cldn12 and Cldn18 was indistinguishable in the normal (not shown) and vehicle-treated (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2m&#x02013;p</xref>) epidermis after 12 weeks, occupying the entire suprabasal compartment (in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> the basal layer is marked by a dotted line and the suprabasal compartment is indicated with a bracket). After 2 weeks of DMBA/TPA treatment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a&#x02013;d</xref>), on the other hand, the suprabasal compartment was expanded, with a corresponding expanded zone of Cldn expression in all the suprabasal layers. However, after 6 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2e&#x02013;h</xref>), 8 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a&#x02013;d</xref>) and 12 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2i&#x02013;l</xref>) weeks, the treated epidermis displayed a marked reduction in the number of suprabasal cell layers staining positively for Cldn6, Cldn11, Cldn12 and Cldn18; the loss of staining was evident in the lower suprabasal zone (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>; representative areas of Cldn-negative suprabasal cells are marked with stars). In addition there was an obvious but somewhat variable shift in the subcellular localization of all four of these Cldns away from the cell membrane that was especially evident in the lower suprabasal layers of the DMBA/TPA-treated epidermis after 8 weeks (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a&#x02013;d</xref>, arrowheads illustrate representative areas where Cldn association is not restricted to cell membranes). Although all of the suprabasal-specific Cldns assayed showed some degree of non-membranous labeling after 8 weeks of treatment, this was especially true for Cldn12 and Cldn18 where the subcellular shift extended higher into the suprabasal zone than for Cldn6 and Cldn11.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Suprabasal-specific Cldns in epidermal tumor progression</bold>.

While the localization of these suprabasal-specific Cldns shifted to varying degrees away from the cell membrane, there was a correspondingly varied reduction in the number of Cldn-positive epidermal cell layers in the lower strata of the epidermis after 6 and 12 weeks.

In addition, there were many Cldn6-, Cldn11-, Cldn12- and Cldn18-negative suprabasal cell layers evident (note that in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, the stars highlight areas of Cldn-negative epidermal cells).</p><p>The expanded suprabasal Cldn expression compartment in early DMBA/TPA treatment, followed by the loss of Cldn6, Cldn11, Cldn12 and Cldn18 in the lower strata of the suprabasal compartment as well as the reduced cell membrane association of those Cldns primarily associated with the stratifying/differentiating layers of the normal epidermis raises the question of whether such changes are obligatory for the promotional stage of skin tumor formation. The change in Cldn expression and localization may also impart new permeability properties to the affected and surrounding epidermal cells resulting in their hyperplastic conversion. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis of Daugherty et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] that undifferentiated cells with poor barrier function exhibit a significant intracellular Cldn pool. In addition to transcriptional and translational regulation of expression levels, barrier function may be influenced by Cldn subcellular localization. In this context the observed changes in Cldn localization described in this study may be a result of multiple mechanisms including changes in Cldn phosphorylation. Although a number of Cldns, including the ones assessed in this study, have computer-predicted phosphorylation sites in the cytoplasmic tail domain, the functional significance of such sites has been demonstrated for only a few Cldns; e.g. Cldn3 where post-translational phosphorylation at threonine 192 has been shown to regulate TJ barrier function in ovarian cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Another possibility is that there is increased endocytosis and/or an inhibition of a post-translational insertion into the ER resulting in Cldn retention in cytoplasmic vesicles. However, further investigation into the molecular mechanism(s) governing Cldn expression and localization in skin tumorigenesis is required.</p></sec><sec><title>Changes in Cldn1 expression through epidermal tumor progression</title><p>Amongst the Cldns in the epidermis, Cldn1 expression is unique and undergoes a maturation switch parallel to the acquisition of epidermal barrier function. In the developing epidermis, Cldn1 expression is first restricted to the stratified layers at E15.5, and by E17.5 it occupies both the basal and suprabasal compartments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. This mature expression pattern is maintained throughout life under normal conditions and was not modified when the epidermis was exposed to vehicle over the duration of tumorigenesis experiments (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4a</xref>, the acetone-treated epidermis after 12 weeks is shown). However in response to DMBA/TPA treatment, Cldn1 lost its normal distribution pattern and adopted an expression like the immature pattern (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Thus, 2 weeks after initiation of the carcinogenesis protocol, Cldn1-positive cells were decreased in the basal layer of the epidermis, while the entire suprabasal compartment maintained cell membrane-associated Cldn1 expression (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4b</xref>); by 4 weeks of treatment, the basal layer was essentially devoid of Cldn1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4c</xref>). After 8 weeks of treatment, the zone of Cldn1-negative cells expanded upwards into the lower strata of the suprabasal compartment, with only sporadic presence of Cldn1 protein remaining (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4d</xref>), a phenomena more exaggerated after 12 weeks (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4e</xref>). However, and in contrast to the normal suprabasal-specific Cldns, the membranous localization of Cldn1 was preserved throughout the 12 weeks of sampling in the upper strata of the suprabasal epidermis. Reminiscent of the reduced number of Cldn6, Cldn11, Cldn12 and Cldn18-positive epithelial cell layers in the characteristic epidermal structures infiltrating the dermis, these areas were completely devoid of Cldn1 expression (not shown).</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Changes in Cldn1 expression in skin tumorigenesis</bold>. In the normal (not shown) and vehicle-treated (<bold>a</bold>, after 12 weeks) epidermis, Cldn1 is localized in the basal and suprabasal layers; however in response to the two-stage chemical carcinogenesis protocol, the number of Cldn1-positive epithelial cells was progressively reduced starting from the basal layer and moving upwards at 2 (<bold>b</bold>), 4 (<bold>c</bold>), 8 (<bold>d</bold>) and 12 (<bold>e</bold>) weeks. Although a distinctly membranous Cldn1 association was maintained in the upper layers of the treated epidermis, as the number of Cldn1-negative epidermal cells in the lower epidermal layers increased, only sporadic Cldn1 localization was evident (<bold>c-e</bold>). The epidermal basal layer is indicated by a dotted line, and the suprabasal compartment is marked with a bracket (<bold>a-c</bold>); note that the basal layer is out of view in panels <bold>d </bold>and <bold>e</bold>; the entire view is therefore the suprabasal compartment and is marked with a double-ended arrow.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2407-7-196-4"/></fig><p>Although the molecular mechanisms responsible for the reduced number of Cldn1-positive cells in epithelial tumorigenesis have not been defined, one possibility involves suppression by the Snail family of genes, which are involved in numerous tumors both in vivo and in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. In support of this notion, functional Snail-binding E-box motifs have been demonstrated to have a suppressive role on Cldn1 expression in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Furthermore, a role for promoter methylation in the silencing of Cldn3, Cldn4 and Cldn7 has been observed in some tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], suggesting that methylation could also play a role. Further studies are required to identify the mechanisms responsible for the changes observed in Cldn expression through epidermal tumor progression. However, our studies indicate that in this model the expression and distribution of Cldns change drastically and in a manner consistent with the loss of cell polarity and altered barrier selectivity concomitant with epidermal tumor formation.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations used</title><p>Cldns: Claudins;</p><p>TJs: Tight junctions;</p><p>DMBA: 7,12-dimethylbenz(<italic>a</italic>)anthracene;</p><p>TPA: 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>AA's contribution entails the acquisition and presentation of data.
