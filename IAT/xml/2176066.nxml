Some remodeling events depend upon a critical nucleo-cytoplasmic ratio, whereas others rely on a maternal timer controlled by cyclin E/Cdk2 activity.

The first twelve cleavage cycles following fertilization consist of rapid oscillations between S and M phase without intervening gap phases. These cell cycles do not engage checkpoints in response to damaged or unreplicated DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Rather, embryonic cells that have incurred such assaults to the genome die by a maternally regulated program of apoptosis during gastrulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Beginning at the midblastula transition (MBT), cell cycles lengthen, acquiring gap phases and operable cell cycle checkpoints [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Furthermore, damaged or unreplicated DNA may trigger abnormal development but generally will not induce apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Although the molecular players in cell cycle remodeling during the early development of <italic>X. laevis </italic>have been well characterized, little is known about the underlying controls that govern these events.</p><p>Early embryonic cell cycles are regulated by three cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) complexes. Cyclin A/Cdk1 and cyclin B/Cdk1 are the M-phase Cdks, and cyclin E/Cdk2 is the S-phase Cdk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], although their functions may overlap [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The activity of the mitotic Cdk complexes are controlled by cyclin synthesis and degradation and by inhibitory phosphorylations on threonine 14 and tyrosine 15 by Wee1 and Myt 1 kinases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Phosphorylation-mediated inhibition of Cdks is counteracted by members of the Cdc25 family of phosphatases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In <italic>X. laevis</italic>, Wee1 kinase is present in pre-MBT embryos, but degraded after the MBT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Prior to the MBT in <italic>X. laevis </italic>embryos, Wee1 and Myt1 act in opposition to Cdc25C, inhibiting Cdk1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>At the MBT, the profile of kinases and phosphatases regulating Cdk activity is modified. Both Cdc25C and Myt 1 persist at relatively constant levels. In contrast, Cdc25A levels drop beginning at the MBT and maternally encoded Wee1 disappears at gastrulation when it is replaced by the more active zygotic kinase, Wee2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. It is likely that this change in the ratio of kinase to phosphatase activity operating on the Cdks is an integral component of cell cycle remodeling that initiates at the MBT. In previous studies that support this hypothesis, overexpression of Cdc25A accelerated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], whereas overexpression of Wee2 lengthened cleavage cycles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>In addition to its role in promoting S phase, cyclin E/Cdk2 also serves a developmental function in early <italic>X. laevis </italic>embryos. Oscillations in cyclin E/Cdk2 activity constitute a maternal developmental timer that regulates the timing of the events of the MBT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. One of these events is the degradation of maternal cyclin E itself [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Inhibition of Cdk2 by the specific Cdk inhibitor, &#x00394;34Xic1, lengthens cleavage and delays the onset of the MBT and the degradation of cyclin E [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Although cyclin E levels are constant throughout pre-MBT development, cyclin E/Cdk2 activity oscillates twice per cell cycle, independently of protein synthesis and the nucleo-cytoplasmic ratio [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. However, other inhibitors of the MBT such as &#x003b1;-amanitin (blocks zygotic transcription) and cycloheximide (blocks protein synthesis) do not affect the timing of cyclin E degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], suggesting that the cyclin E/Cdk2 timer regulates the MBT but not vice versa. Overexpression of cyclin E in the early embryo disrupts nuclear divisions and triggers apoptosis after the MBT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. These effects are independent of Cdk activity, suggesting further complexity of the role of cyclin E during early development. A better understanding of how the cyclin E/Cdk2 developmental clock is regulated should give insight into the mechanisms that drive cell cycle remodeling at the MBT.</p><p>It has been proposed that oscillatory activity of cyclin E/Cdk2 is governed by changes in phosphorylation state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. However, the kinases and phosphatases that govern cyclin E/Cdk2 activity in <italic>X. laevis </italic>embryos are unknown. Overexpression of Chk1 in <italic>X. laevis </italic>embryos, which activates Wee1 and inhibits Cdc25A and Cdc25C, delays both the MBT and cyclin E degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], suggesting that the cyclin E/Cdk2 timer is regulated by its phosphorylation state. In mammalian cells, Wee1 inhibits cyclin E/Cdk2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], but it was previously unknown whether Wee1 regulated cyclin E/Cdk2 activity <italic>in X. laevis</italic>.</p><p>Wee1 is the opposing kinase of Cdc25, is degraded after the MBT, and functions to inhibit both cyclin B/Cdk1 in metazoans and cyclin E/Cdk2 in mammals. Therefore, we disrupted the balance of Cdk phosphatase and kinase activity by overexpressing Wee1 in <italic>X. laevis </italic>embryos to more closely identify its role in cell cycle remodeling during the early embryonic development of <italic>X. laevis</italic>. Our results indicate that an imbalance of Cdk-inhibitory activity triggers apoptosis, most likely through the disruption of the cyclin E/Cdk2 timer, since direct inhibition of cyclin E/Cdk2 also induces apoptosis. These data suggest that proper coordination of cell cycle remodeling events at the MBT is required for embryonic survival. By comparing the developmental effects of Cdk inhibitors that trigger apoptosis to those that inhibit apoptosis, we identified Cdc25A as an important predictor of developmentally regulated apoptosis in <italic>X. laevis </italic>embryos.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Overexpression of Wee1 lengthens pre-MBT cell cycles</title><p>To determine the effect of disrupting the balance of Cdk kinase and phosphatase activities in embryos prior to the MBT, 2.5 ng mRNA encoding wild-type Wee1 or luciferase (control) was microinjected into one-cell stage embryos.

Similarly, control embryos expressing luciferase demonstrated low levels of Cdk phosphorylation until the MBT. In contrast, Cdks were phosphorylated on tyrosine 15 as early as 3 hrs pf in embryos expressing exogenous Wee1, suggesting the cell cycle delay resulted from the inhibition of Cdks.</p><p>Mitotic cleavage cycles and nuclear cycles of DNA replication can be uncoupled in early <italic>X. laevis </italic>embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Therefore, we wanted to determine whether exogenous Wee1 also affected DNA replication in early embryos. Total DNA was isolated from embryos expressing Wee1 or luciferase, resolved by gel electrophoresis and stained with ethidium bromide. Embryos expressing exogenous Wee1 contained less DNA throughout early development, compared to luciferase controls (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). However, the DNA content increased through the early development of embryos overexpresssing Wee1 indicative of continuing DNA replication. The rate of increase in DNA content was consistent with the lengthened cleavage cycles, suggesting that nuclear and cytoplasmic cycles were coordinated. To examine nuclear morphology, embryos were collected at several stages, sectioned and stained with DAPI. Representative fields from embryos collected at Stage 9 are shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>. Embryos overexpressing Wee1 contained interphase and mitotic nuclei with normal morphology. There was no loss of nuclei as seen in embryos overexpressing cyclin E [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], although there were fewer and larger cells in these embryos, consistent with the delayed cell cycles. These results indicate that the overexpression of Wee1 delays both nuclear and cleavage cycles, but these cycles appear to remain coupled.</p></sec><sec><title>Overexpression of Wee1 triggers apoptosis after the MBT</title><p>In previous studies, we showed that <italic>X. laevis </italic>embryos expressing exogenous checkpoint kinases, Chk1 or Chk2, exhibited a similar cell cycle delay and premature Cdk phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].

This evidence and the prediction of our mathematical model suggest that timing of cyclin E degradation is determined by cyclin E/Cdk2 activity itself [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].

In order to determine whether Wee1 inhibits Cdk2 in early <italic>X. laevis </italic>embryos, cyclin E was immunoprecipitated from embryos overexpressing Wee1, and Western analysis was performed on the immunoprecipitates to detect inhibitory tyrosine phosphorylation on Cdk2. Embryos overexpressing Wee1 expressed higher levels of phosphorylated Cdk2 (PCdk) indicating inhibition of Cdk2 by Wee1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). These results suggest that the delays in degradation of cyclin E and Cdc25A by the overexpression of Wee1 could be due to the inhibition of Cdk2. The inhibition of cyclin E/Cdk2 is also consistent with the reduced DNA content in embryos expressing Wee1, since cyclin E/Cdk2 promotes the initiation of DNA replication during S phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].</p><p>To more directly measure Cdk activity, cyclin E immunoprecipitates were tested for kinase activity against histone H1.

Despite the increased tyrosine phosphorylation of Cdk2 in embryos overexpressing Wee1, Cdk2 kinase activity was not repressed. In fact, Cdk2 activity persisted in these embryos after it had decreased after the MBT in control embryos. The persistence of Cdk2 is consistent with the delay in cyclin E degradation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). However, it was surprising that Cdk2 activity was not reduced since we had observed tyrosine phosphorylation of Cdk2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>) and this phosphorylation event is known to inhibit Cdk2 activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. One explanation may be that exogenous Wee1 only phosphorylates a fraction of Wee1.

The &#x00394;34-Xic1 protein is a truncated form of the full length-Xic1 that specifically inhibits the activity of cyclin E/Cdk2 in <italic>X. laevis </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. In <italic>X. leavis </italic>embryos, the expression of &#x00394;34-Xic1 delays the degradation of cyclin E, thereby disrupting the cyclin E/Cdk2 timer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. The p27Xic1CK- construct contains four point mutations in the Cdk2 binding site that inhibit p27Xic1/Cdk2 interaction, thus serving as a negative control.</p><p>Embryos expressing &#x00394;34-Xic1 were delayed slightly (~1 cell cycle at the MBT) compared to p27Xic1CK- controls (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>) but developed otherwise normally through the MBT. However, prior to gastrulation, embryos expressing &#x00394;34-Xic1 died by apoptosis, indicated by gross morphology (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>) and activation of caspases (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). In contrast, embryos injected with p27Xic1CK- protein persisted through gastrulation and neurulated (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). These data indicate that specific inhibition of Cdk2 results in apoptosis in <italic>Xenopus </italic>embryos.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Inhibition of Cdk2 triggers apoptosis</bold>.

We initiated these experiments because our previous studies suggested Chk1/Chk2 kinases function as inhibitors of apoptosis in early <italic>X. laevis </italic>embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Expression of catalytically inactive, dominant-negative Chk1 or Chk2 in pre-MBT embryos induces apoptosis during early gastrulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Furthermore, wild-type Chk2 rescues embryos from radiation-induced apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Because exogenous Chk2 lengthens cleavage cycles in a dose-dependent manner, one possible explanation for the protection from apoptosis was that longer cell cycles allowed time for repair of DNA damage. If this were the case, then Wee1, which also lengthens cleavage cycles due to tyrosine phosphorylation of Cdks, should also protect embryos from DNA damage-induced apoptosis.</p><p>However, the studies reported here yielded unexpected results and valuable information regarding the role and regulation of Cdk phosphorylation states in the early embryo. Wee1 mRNA lengthened cell cycles modestly, and until the MBT (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>), embryos overexpressing Wee1 were indistinguishable from those expressing low levels of exogenous Chk2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Both groups of embryos were delayed approximately one cell cycle when sibling controls reached the MBT. Furthermore, the extent of tyrosine phosphorylation was similar in embryos expressing exogenous Chk2 or Wee1. Despite these similarities, embryos injected with Wee1 mRNA died by apoptosis in the absence of any further perturbation.</p><p>Previous studies have implicated Wee1 as an inhibitor of Cdk2 activity in mammalian cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], but Wee1 had only been reported as a Cdk1 kinase in <italic>X. laevis </italic>embryos. In this study, we demonstrated that Wee1 delayed the degradation of cyclin E and phosphorylation of Cdk2, which functions as a developmental timer until the MBT. However, the catalytic activity of the total pool of cyclin E/Cdk2 was not reduced and persisted in embryos overexpressing Wee1, consistent with the cell cycle delay and delayed degradation of cyclin E. Therefore, like Chk1/Chk2, Wee1 causes tyrosine phosphoryation of Cdk1 and Cdk2 in <italic>X. laevis </italic>embryos. Nonetheless, despite similar effects on the cell cycle machinery, they have opposite effects regarding apoptosis in the embryo.</p><p>Because we discovered Wee1 to alter Cdk2 phosphorylation as well as trigger apoptosis, we tested whether apoptosis could be induced by a more specific Cdk2 inhibitor. A variant of Xic1 lacking the first 34 amino acids (&#x00394;34-Xic1) is a specific stoichiometric inhibitor of cyclin E/Cdk2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] and delays both the degradaton of cyclin E and the onset of the MBT in <italic>X. laevis </italic>embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. In our studies, one hundred percent of embryos injected with exogenous &#x00394;34-Xic1 underwent apoptosis after the MBT (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). Similarly, in breast cancer cells, transduction of a non-degradable form of the human homolog of Xic1, Kip1, induced cell cycle arrest, thereby inhibiting cellular proliferation. Furthermore, exogenous Kip1 caused an increase in the number of apoptotic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> and Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> summarize the effects of three different types of Cdk inhibitors on early development in <italic>X. laevis </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Exogenous Chk1/2, Wee1, and &#x00394;34-Xic1 all modestly lengthen cleavage cycles, and delay the degradation of cyclin E, thus delaying the timing of the MBT. Whereas Chk1/2 and Wee1 inhibit Cdk1 and cause phosphorylation of Cdk2, &#x00394;34-Xic1 is a specific inhibitor of Cdk2. These data stress the importance of cyclin E/Cdk2 in the timing of early developmental events.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Effects of inhibitors of Cdk activity on early development of <italic>X. laevis</italic></bold>.

One possible explanation for this difference apparent in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> is the effect of these reagents on Cdc25A levels at the MBT and consequently on the ratio of Cdk kinases:phosphatases at the MBT. Chk1/Chk2 trigger the premature degradation of Cdc25A before the MBT whereas Wee1 and &#x00394;34-Xic1 delay the degradation of Cdc25A. These data suggest that Cdc25A may promote apoptosis and/or that a high Cdk kinase:phosphatase ratio inhibits apoptosis. In support of the former, exogenous non-degradable Cdc25A triggers cell death in the embryo during early gastrulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. In support of the latter Chk1/Chk2 may activate Wee1 in <italic>X. laevis</italic>, leading to an even higher Cdk kinase:phosphatase level than would be achieved by the degradation of Cdc25A alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Alternatively, Chk1/Chk2 may block apoptosis by another pathway altogether, distinct from their effect on the cell cycle machinery. These studies illustrate that cell cycle remodeling events must be appropriately coordinated for the embryo to develop beyond the MBT. These studies also illustrate that cell cycle regulators that have been well characterized biochemically <italic>in vitro </italic>or in cell culture systems may have additional functions that can be uncovered in the rich context of the developing embryo.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Manipulation and maintenance of embryos</title><p>Eggs from wild-type <italic>Xenopus laevis </italic>(<italic>Xenopus </italic>Express) were fertilized <italic>in vitro</italic>, dejellied in 2% cysteine in 0.1&#x000d7; MMR (0.5 mM HEPES, pH 7.8, 10 mM NaCl, 0.2 mM KCl, 0.1 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 0.2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.01 mM EDTA), and maintained in 0.1&#x000d7; MMR.
