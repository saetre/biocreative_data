This wide range of phenotypes is presumably attributed to alterations of FLNa association with F-actin and its binding partners, obstructing analysis of mechanisms underlying FLNa pathogenesis.</p><p>FLNa is a dominant isoform of FLN family proteins (a, b and c) and all isoforms are dimers of 270&#x0223c;280 kDa subunits that have N-terminal spectrin-related actin-binding domains (srABD) separated from C-terminal dimerization domain by 23 Ig repeats organized as linear rod like strands. Two flexible hinges separate Ig repeats 15 and 16 and 23 and 24 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004928-Stossel1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004928-Nakamura1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. FLNa cross-links F-actin to form orthogonal networks that are responsible for cellular integrity and mechanics and attaches to membrane receptors including adhesion molecules and ion channels. FLNa is also a scaffold for numerous intracellular signaling intermediates. One of these, FilGAP, has a pleckstrin homology domain for membrane lipid binding, a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) domain, and a coiled-coil domain responsible for FLNa binding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004928-Ohta1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. FilGAP specifically inactivates Rac <italic>in vivo</italic>, and this activity requires its FLNa association. FilGAP controls cell polarity and movement downstream of ROCK (Rho-kinase) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004928-Ohta1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Sorting out the contributions of these numerous interactions to <italic>in vivo</italic> function requires structural information to enable use of point mutant FLNa or partners lacking specific activities that are otherwise fully functional. Here we describe the structure of the FLNa/FilGAP complex and use the information to engineer mutant protein incapable of expressing FilGAP function <italic>in vivo</italic>. We also show that FilGAP interacts exclusively with FLNa among its homologs and specific disruption of the FLNa-FilGAP interaction perturbs cell spreading. Furthermore, we show that two FLNa mutations found in PVNH and FMD patients disrupt the folding of FLNa Ig repeat (IgFLNa) 23 and abolish FilGAP binding, establishing a link between downstream signaling of Rac and the patients' pathogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Identification of the FLNa-binding interface with FilGAP</title><p>Most of the protein constructs used for <italic>in vitro</italic> binding assay were obtained in good yield and purity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0004928.s001">Figure S1A</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004928-g001">Figure 1A</xref> shows a schematic diagram of FilGAP structure and demonstrates that the C-terminal 100 residues (649&#x02013;748 amino acid, aa) of FilGAP tagged to a glutathione S-transferase-hexahistidine (GST-His) interact with purified full-length FLNa <italic>in vitro</italic>, consistent with previous results <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004928-Ohta1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>.

Further evidence for FilGAP's use of a similar binding motifs are: 1) Phe726, Leu732, and Val734 in the FilGAP binding site are identical to the corresponding amino acids of GPIb&#x003b1;, which make strong hydrophobic contacts with FLNa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004928-Nakamura2">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>; and 2) the amino acid positions corresponding to Thr728 and Gly730 in FilGAP vary between GPIb&#x003b1; and integrin &#x003b2;.

The coiled-coil domain of FilGAP is a decamer when fused to an MBP-His tag, presumably because coiled-coil domains aggregate in a variety of conformations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004928-Woolfson1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>.

Residues 649&#x02013;729 do not bind FLNa, indicating that the coiled-coil interaction functions only to dimerize FilGAP. These data also suggest that FilGAP domains other than the coiled-coil domain allow dimerization while preventing oligomerization. Although NMR detects interaction of IgFLNa23 with FilGAP peptide, neither monomeric IgFLNa23 nor FilGAP biochemically pulled each other down, indicating that their affinities for each other are very low. Binding strength or avidity of macromolecules is governed by three major factors: the intrinsic affinity of the individual binding interface, the valency of the binding site(s), and geometric arrangement of the interacting components <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004928-Nakamura1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004928-Morris1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>.

Our data demonstrated that IgFLNa24 and the coiled-coil domain of FilGAP mediate dimerization of FLNa and FilGAP, respectively, and define their geometric arrangements and valencies, thereby increasing avidity of the FLNa-FilGAP complex. Moreover, FLNa hinge 2 (32aa residues) does not contribute to valency but defines the configurations that favor FilGAP binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004928-g008">Figure 8</xref>).
