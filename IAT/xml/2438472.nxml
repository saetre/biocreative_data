Notably, <italic>JARID1C</italic> mutations cause mental retardation and increased aggression in humans. These phenotypes are consistent with the expression patterns we have identified in mouse brain where <italic>Jarid1c</italic> mRNA was detected in hippocampus, hypothalamus, and cerebellum. <italic>Jarid1c</italic> expression and associated active histone marks at its 5&#x02032;end are high in P19 neurons, indicating that JARID1C demethylase plays an important role in differentiated neuronal cells. We found that XX mice expressed <italic>Jarid1c</italic> more highly than XY mice, independent of their gonadal types (testes versus ovaries). This increased expression in XX mice is consistent with <italic>Jarid1c</italic> escape from X inactivation and is not compensated by expression from the Y-linked paralogue <italic>Jarid1d</italic>, which is expressed at a very low level compared to the X paralogue in P19 cells. Our observations suggest that sex-specific expression of <italic>Jarid1c</italic> may contribute to sex differences in brain function.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="6"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mutations in <italic>JARID1C</italic> are one of the leading causes of X-linked mental retardation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002553-Jensen1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002553-Tzschach1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

Since this histone modification is associated with enhanced gene activity, demethylation of H3 lysine 4 by JARID1C leads to transcriptional repression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002553-Klose1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. In particular, neuronal specific genes are repressed in stem cells and non-neural tissues in part due to JARID1C-mediated H3K4 demethylation at promoter sequences of these genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002553-Tahiliani1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>.

To better understand the pathophysiology of mental retardation and increased aggression caused by <italic>JARID1C</italic> mutations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002553-Jensen1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002553-Tzschach1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002553-Santos1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, it is important to determine where JARID1C accumulates in the brain. In the present study we determined the pattern of expression of <italic>Jarid1c</italic> in mouse brain sections by <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization.</p><p>In human and in mouse, the <italic>JARID1C/Jarid1c</italic> gene escapes X inactivation, i.e. it is expressed from both alleles in females <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002553-Wu1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002553-Agulnik1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, it is not surprising that <italic>Jarid1c</italic> expression is higher in brains from adult females compared to males <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002553-Xu1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. However, the role of sex hormones such as testosterone and estrogens, which could dramatically affect gene expression, was not investigated in our previous study. To simultaneously examine the effects of sex hormones (male versus female) and of the sex chromosome complement (XY versus XX), we have now used a transgenic mouse model, which consists of four genetically distinct types of mice: XX normal females, XY<sup>&#x02212;</sup> females (XY mice sex-reversed by deletion of <italic>Sry</italic>), XY<sup>&#x02212;</sup><italic>Sry</italic> males (XY<sup>&#x02212;</sup> mice with an <italic>Sry</italic> transgene to restore the male sex), and XX<italic>Sry</italic> males (XX mice sex-reversed by insertion of an <italic>Sry</italic> transgene) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002553-LovellBadge1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002553-Mahadevaiah1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>An important question is whether the sex difference in <italic>Jarid1c</italic> expression is present in all tissues and developmental stages. The reported expression of <italic>Jarid1c</italic> from the inactive X ranges between 20&#x00025; and 100&#x00025; of that from the active X chromosome, depending on the tissue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002553-Carrel1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002553-Lingenfelter1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, we have previously shown that <italic>Jarid1c</italic> is transiently silenced on the inactive X chromosome in early development, suggesting that <italic>Jarid1c</italic> may have a similar expression level between the sexes at certain developmental stages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002553-Lingenfelter1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, we compared <italic>Jarid1c</italic> expression in neonates and adult mice. Since the higher expression of <italic>Jarid1c</italic> in females could theoretically be compensated for in males by expression from the Y-linked paralogue, <italic>Jarid1d</italic>, we also examined expression of this gene. The two paralogues are highly similar in nucleotide and amino acid sequence and both function as histone demethylases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002553-Lee1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002553-Agulnik1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. However, it is plausible that the two paralogues differ in their expression patterns across tissues as a result of differences in their developmental regulation. For instance, <italic>Utx</italic> and <italic>Uty</italic>, another X&#x02013;Y paralogous gene pair, appear to be differentially regulated and expressed in the brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002553-Xu2">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. We tested this possibility by in situ hybridization to brain sections. In addition, quantitative RT-PCR was done in male P19 embryonic carcinoma (EC) cells (hereafter P19 stem cells) that can be differentiated into neurons. This study was extended to four additional X/Y gene pairs. Transcriptional regulation of genes is modulated by histone modifications, DNA methylation, and non-coding RNA binding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002553-Jenuwein1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Active histone marks include histone H3 and H4 acetylation at lysine residues (H3ac and H4ac), and H3 di- or tri-methylation at lysine 4 (H3K4me2 or H3K4me3; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002553-Klose1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002553-Grunstein1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>).

We determined that expression from the Y-linked paralogue <italic>Jarid1d</italic> is very low in P19 stem cells and in differentiated neurons, suggesting that it does not compensate for the difference in <italic>Jarid1c</italic> levels between males and females in these cell types.

In adult mouse brain, the expression pattern of <italic>Jarid1c</italic> was generally in line with cell densities, i.e. brain regions with higher cell density showed higher levels of hybridization signals. However, some areas (including triangular septal nucleus, anterior paraventricular thalamic nucleus, BST, anteroventral thalamic nucleus, interstitial nucleus of Cajal, mammallary nuclei, and pontine nuclei) showed high expression despite low neuron densities, suggesting specifically enhanced expression in these cell types. We are currently carrying out detailed analyses to locate and quantify the transcripts inside specific cellular compartments in males and females.</p><p><italic>Jarid1c</italic> encodes a histone demethylase specific for histone H3 where it converts tri-methylated lysine 4 to di- and mono-methylated forms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002553-Iwase1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002553-Tahiliani1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. This activity results in gene repression by removal of the active epigenetic mark. Although the complete list of genes targeted by JARID1C is not fully established, one group of neuronal genes that shares similar motifs at their promoter is regulated by this demethylase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002553-Tahiliani1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. These genes are stably repressed in stem cells and non-neural tissues following binding of the REST complex that consists of several proteins including REST, JARID1C and other chromatin modifying enzymes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002553-Tahiliani1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Surprisingly, we found that <italic>Jarid1c</italic> was highly expressed in P19 differentiated neurons, a finding seemingly contradictory to JARID1C's role as a powerful repressor of neuronal specific genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002553-Tahiliani1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Our observations, which were obtained on fully differentiated neurons, support the hypothesis that JARID1C plays an additional role in neurite development. In a previous study a <italic>Jarid1c</italic> knockdown in cultured cerebellar neurons led to shorter neurites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002553-Iwase1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Using a mouse model to distinguish the effects of steroid hormones from those of the sex chromosome complement <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002553-Arnold1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref> we found that XX mice had a higher level of <italic>Jarid1c</italic> than XY mice, irrespective of whether they were phenotypic males with testes or females with ovaries. These findings are best explained by the fact that XX mice have two actively transcribed copies of <italic>Jarid1c</italic> due to escape from X inactivation. Although <italic>Jarid1c</italic> is transcribed from both copies in a XX mouse, the expression from the inactive X chromosome is often lower relative to the active X chromosome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002553-Carrel1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002553-Lingenfelter1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. Although the parsimonious explanation for the sex difference in <italic>Jarid1c</italic> expression is that XX females have two actively transcribed copies relative to males having one copy, it is possible that the transcriptional activity of <italic>Jarid1c</italic> differs between one of the two copies in females and the single copy in males. For instance, there is a possible gonadal steroid effect on <italic>Jarid1c</italic> expression since we have not tested by manipulating steroid hormones' levels in gonadectomized mice. Moreover, it is also possible that a Y-linked factor, such as JARID1D suppresses the expression of <italic>Jarid1c</italic> in XY mice. It is not certain whether the sex differences we observed for <italic>Jarid1c</italic> mRNA will necessarily result in a corresponding difference at the protein level. Indeed, <italic>Eif2s3x</italic>, another gene that escapes X inactivation in humans and mice, displays sex specific expression at the mRNA level, but not at the protein level <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002553-Xu3">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Expression of Y-linked paralogues in males could theoretically compensate for the high expression of genes that escape X inactivation in females <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002553-Graves1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. However, we found that expression of all five mouse X-linked genes examined here was consistently higher &#x02013; up to a thousand fold &#x02013; than that of their Y paralogues. Thus, it appears that the Y-linked paralogues did not compensate for higher female-specific expression in these cultured cells. This is consistent with our previous observation in mouse brain that the summed expression of X- and Y-linked paralogues in males is less abundant than that of the two X paralogues in females, one escaping X inactivation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002553-Xu1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. If our observations are confirmed in humans, this could explain why males who carry <italic>JARID1C</italic> mutations are affected in spite of having a normal copy of the Y-linked <italic>JARID1D</italic> gene. Alternatively, JARID1D, despite an apparently similar function as a histone demethylase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002553-Lee2">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, may have a different role from JARID1C. Among the five mouse X&#x02013;Y gene pairs compared in our study, two (<italic>Utx/Uty</italic>, <italic>Usp9x/Usp9y</italic>) have a Y paralogue with a separate function from the X-linked paralogue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002553-Xu2">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002553-Lan1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002553-Hall1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, which is consistent with the differential expression of the paralogues in P19 cells. The lower expression of all Y paralogues may be due to their location in the generally heterochromatic Y chromosome and/or to the up-regulation of the active X chromosome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002553-Nguyen1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Gene expression is tightly regulated by histone modifications.
