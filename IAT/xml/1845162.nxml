Here, using fluorescent reporters, we shown in cells that, contrary to in vitro analyses, 3-phosphoinositide&#x02013;dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1) is complexed to its substrate, PKB. The use of F&#x000f6;rster resonance energy transfer detected by both frequency domain and two-photon time domain fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy has lead to novel in vivo findings. The preactivation complex of PKB and PDK1 is maintained in an inactive state through a PKB intramolecular interaction between its pleckstrin homology (PH) and kinase domains, in a &#x0201c;PH-in&#x0201d; conformer. This domain&#x02013;domain interaction prevents the PKB activation loop from being phosphorylated by PDK1. The interactive regions for this intramolecular PKB interaction were predicted through molecular modeling and tested through mutagenesis, supporting the derived model. Physiologically, agonist-induced phosphorylation of PKB by PDK1 occurs coincident to plasma membrane recruitment, and we further shown here that this process is associated with a conformational change in PKB at the membrane, producing a &#x0201c;PH-out&#x0201d; conformer and enabling PDK1 access the activation loop. The active, phosphorylated, &#x0201c;PH-out&#x0201d; conformer can dissociate from the membrane and retain this conformation to phosphorylate substrates distal to the membrane. These in vivo studies provide a new model for the mechanism of activation of PKB. This study takes a crucial widely studied regulator (physiology and pathology) and addresses the fundamental question of the dynamic in vivo behaviour of PKB with a detailed molecular mechanism. This has important implications not only in extending our understanding of this oncogenic protein kinase but also in opening up distinct opportunities for therapeutic intervention.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>Regulation of intracellular signaling depends on the precise operation of molecular switches such as kinases and phosphatases. Disruption of their activities leads to inappropriate cellular proliferation, growth, and survival. Protein kinase B (PKB) is a critical kinase that regulates events downstream of growth factor receptors. It is also involved in human cancer, where its overexpression induces malignant transformation. We studied the molecular mechanisms of PKB's interaction with its upstream regulator, 3-phosphoinositide&#x02013;dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1). By using a fluorescent probe, we monitored the conformational changes of PKB in cells using F&#x000f6;rster resonance energy transfer detected by fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy. Applying this approach, we show that PKB and PDK1 are found as complexes in the cytoplasm. Despite this proximity to its regulator, we show that PKB remains inactive through an intramolecular interaction of its pleckstrin homology (PH) domain and kinase domain. We refer to this inactive state as the &#x0201c;PH-in&#x0201d; conformer. Following growth factor activation, PKB changes conformation to the &#x0201c;PH-out&#x0201d; conformer and is phosphorylated by PDK1. The active &#x0201c;PH-out&#x0201d; conformer dissociates from the plasma membrane to phosphorylate downstream proteins.

The current models of PKB activation only speculate, based on the regulation of other AGC kinases, how PKB may change its conformation to interact with PtdIns at the plasma membrane and thereafter be activated by PDK1. The functionally independent behaviour of the PH and kinase domains of PKB is well characterised; the structure of both has been solved separately &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050095-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050095-b007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050095-b011">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050095-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;.

However, the more complex interactions between the PH and kinase domains have not succumbed to direct structural analysis and remain to be elucidated. The recent advent of an in vivo probe to monitor PKB conformational changes in conjunction with molecular modeling has permitted analysis of the mechanism by which these two domains interact and how PKB changes conformation in relation to its activation by PDK1. We have addressed the possible molecular mechanisms involved in the conformational dynamics of PKB and dissected its activation in intact cells. This has important implications not only in extending our understanding of this critical regulator but also in opening distinct opportunities for therapeutic intervention.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>PDK1 Precomplexes with Its Substrate PKB in the Cytoplasm</title><p>It has been assumed that upon activation of various growth factor pathways, PDK1 and PKB uniquely colocalise at the plasma membrane, permitting PDK1 to phosphorylate PKB. To assess in single cells the dynamic relationship between PKB&#x003b1; and PDK1, F&#x000f6;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) was exploited. Two fusion proteins were generated by genetically encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) (donor) at the N terminus of PDK1 and monomeric RFP (acceptor) at the N terminus of PKB&#x003b1;. NIH3T3 cells were transfected with the expression vectors for GFP-PDK1 and RFP-PKB, and the expressed proteins behaviours were followed upon stimulation of the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor pathway (note that the levels of expression were the minimum required for data acquisition). For optimum spatial resolution, FRET was monitored by two-photon fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM). Resonance energy transfer was detected by the decrease in the donor lifetime in the presence of the acceptor. The variations in lifetime are presented by lifetime distributions curves and mean FRET efficiency. Coexpression of RFP-PKB with GFP-PDK1 in NIH3T3 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050095-g001">Figure 1</xref>A) induced a decrease in the lifetime of GFP-PDK1. The decrease in the donor lifetime is quantitatively presented by the lifetime distribution curves. The blue curve is the GFP-PDK1 when expressed alone, and the green curve is when it is expressed with RFP-PKB (acceptor). From this reduction in lifetime, we deduced that, at steady state, GFP-PDK1 and RFP-PKB interact in the cytoplasm. The cytoplasmic mean FRET efficiency presented as box and whiskers plots is 2.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050095-g001">Figure 1</xref>C). Upon PDGF stimulation, both PKB and PDK1 translocated to the plasma membrane, and a further decrease in the average lifetime was detected (orange curve). The translocation of RFP-PKB to the plasma membrane is clearly shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050095-sg006">Figure S6</xref>. The separation of the lifetime distributions at the plasma membrane versus the cytoplasm (red curve: plasma membrane; light green curve: cytoplasm) showed that at the plasma membrane, the mean FRET efficiency is 7.1, and in the cytoplasm, it is 4.9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050095-g001">Figure 1</xref>C). These results indicated that PDK1 and PKB interacted under basal conditions and that the stimulation of the PDGF receptor pathway promoted an enrichment of the PKB&#x02013;PDK1 complex at the plasma membrane. This intermolecular interaction was also demonstrated by frequency domain FLIM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050095-sg001">Figure S1</xref>). This behaviour indicates that in the cytoplasm, the PKB&#x02013;PDK1 complex is at equilibrium determined by the bulk phase concentrations. Upon stimulation, the local concentration of both proteins is enhanced at the plasma membrane, whereby the equilibrium is shifted toward the formation of the PKB&#x02013;PDK1 complex.</p><p>To verify that the PKB&#x02013;PDK1 interaction was due to docking and not purely concentration effects in the cytoplasm due to transfection, GFP-PKB alone or together with RFP-PKB was expressed in NIH3T3 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050095-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). The lifetimes from cells with expression levels of donor (GFP-PKB) and acceptor (RFP-PKB), comparable to those of GFP-PDK1 and RFP-PKB, were identified. Despite the colocalisation of GFP-PKB and RFP-PKB in the cytoplasm and the corecruitment of both PKBs at the plasma membrane, upon activation, the FRET efficiency did not change. This is clearly illustrated by the complete lack of lifetime variation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050095-g001">Figure 1</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050095-g001">1</xref>C). These data indicated that PDK1 and PKB were docking in the cytoplasm and at the plasma membrane under steady state and stimulated conditions.</p><p>To further investigate whether the docking was PtdIns (3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> dependent, cells were pretreated with the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002 prior to PDGF stimulation. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050095-g001">Figure 1</xref>D shows that with LY294002, the translocation of PKB and PDK1 is prevented. However, a cytoplasmic FRET efficiency of 3.4, similar to basal conditions, was still observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050095-g001">Figure 1</xref>E). The PDGF-induced phosphorylation of Thr308 and Ser473 was reduced on pretreatment with LY294002 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050095-sg002">Figure S2</xref>E). This indicated that the recruitment of the PKB&#x02013;PDK1 complex to the plasma membrane was dependent on PtdIns (3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> production, while the docking of PKB to PDK1 in the cytoplasm was PtdIns (3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> independent. To assess the role of PtdIns (3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> in an inhibitor-independent manner, PKB and PDK1 PH domain mutants (mutants that do not efficiently bind to phosphoinositide lipids: PDK1 RRR and PKB R25C &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050095-b016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050095-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;) were used to determine their influence on interaction with their wild-type binding partners. Cells were cotransfected with GFP-PDK1/RFP-PKB R25C or GFP-PDK1 RRR/RFP-PKB. Under basal conditions, both wild-type proteins interacted with their mutant partner (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050095-sg003">Figure S3</xref>A and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050095-sg003">S3</xref>B). However, upon activation, the PH mutants did not translocate to the plasma membrane and a change in FRET efficiency was not detected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050095-sg003">Figure S3</xref>C). It is concluded that complex formation in the cytosol is independent of lipid binding.</p><p>PDK1 docks with phosphorylated/acidic hydrophobic motifs at the C termini of some AGC kinases. This is affected through a PDK1 interacting fragment domain (PIF pocket) and additionally through a phosphate-binding site within the upper lobe of the PDK1 kinase domain. PDK1 mutants defective in these interactions, namely the L155E mutant in the PIF pocket and the R131A mutant in the phosphate-binding pocket, still interacted with PKB in the cytoplasm or on PDGF stimulation at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050095-sg004">Figure S4</xref>A and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050095-sg004">S4</xref>B). Moreover, the PKB mutant that is not phosphorylated in response to agonists, T308A/S473A (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050095-sg004">Figure S4</xref>C), also retained binding capacity, confirming independently that PKB Ser473 phosphorylation was not required for docking into PDK1&#x02032;s phosphate-binding pocket. Therefore, the interaction of PKB and PDK1 is independent of the PIF and the phosphate-binding pockets and does not require phosphorylation of Thr308 or Ser473 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050095-sg004">Figure S4</xref>D). In line with this observation, it has also been shown by using knock-in mutants of PDK1 that the PIF pocket and the phosphate-binding pocket of PDK1 were not implicated in the activation of PKB &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050095-b018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050095-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;. Therefore, the interaction in the cytoplasm occurs via mechanisms that are distinct from those of other AGC kinases.</p><p>Since these kinases interacted in the cytoplasm, it was of interest to determine why PKB was not constitutively phosphorylated by the associated PDK1 in the basal state. One of the mechanisms that regulate the basal levels of Ser473 is the dephosphorylation of this residue by a serine/threonine protein phosphatase, PP2A, implicated in the downregulation of PKB activation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050095-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d;. It was postulated that dephosphorylation may dominate the cytoplasmic phosphorylation of PKB. To test this hypothesis, PP2A activity was blocked by treating cells with okadaic acid. The time-dependent increase of RFP-PKB Ser473 phosphorylation upon treatment indicated that in the absence of PP2A, phosphorylation of Ser473 was enhanced, showing that in NIH3T3 cells PP2A regulates Ser473 phosphorylation in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050095-sg002">Figure S2</xref>A). The okadaic acid&#x02013;insensitive phosphatase PHLPP &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050095-b021">21</xref>&#x0005d; cannot therefore regulate the basal phosphorylation process. Unlike Ser473, the okadaic acid stimulation of Thr308 was modest. It was possible that the &#x0201c;basal state&#x0201d; phosphorylation induced by okadaic acid occurred via a transient PtdIns (3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>&#x02013;associated form. To investigate this, we exploited the nonbinding PH domain mutant of PKB (RFP-PKB R25C). The okadaic acid&#x02013;induced phosphorylation of Ser473 and Thr308 did not differ significantly from that of wild-type PKB, whereas the PDGF-induced phosphorylation of RFP-PKB R25C was significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050095-sg002">Figure S2</xref>B). These data indicated that the okadaic acid&#x02013;induced phosphorylations occurred in the cytoplasm. In RFP-PKB&#x02013;transfected cells, the okadaic acid&#x02013;induced Ser473 phosphorylation was at the same level as the Ser473 phosphorylation induced by PDGF (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050095-sg002">Figure S2</xref>A, densitometry). However, in the case of phospho-Thr308, the okadaic acid signal was reduced compared to phosphorylation triggered by PDGF stimulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050095-sg002">Figure S2</xref>A, densitometry). The reduced phosphorylation of Thr308 led to the hypothesis that Thr308 was inaccessible in the cytoplasmic PDK1 complex due to PH domain steric hindrance. If this hypothesis is correct, then the removal of the PH domain should alter the kinetics of Thr308 phosphorylation in response to okadaic acid. Thr308 phosphorylation of the deletion mutant RFP-&#x00394;PH PKB was more extensive than the wild-type PKB (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050095-sg002">Figure S2</xref>C). This provided evidence that, in the cytoplasm, Thr308 was not fully accessible to PDK1 and hence could not be phosphorylated.</p><p>To verify that in the RFP-&#x00394;PH-PKB mutant Thr308 phosphorylation was due to PDK1, NIH3T3 cells were cotransfected with RFP-&#x00394;PH PKB and GFP-PDK1 wild-type or the PH domain mutant GFP-PDK1 RRR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050095-sg002">Figure S2</xref>D). In all cases, a prominent phosphorylation of Thr308 independent of PDGF was detected. Therefore, it is established that when the PKB PH domain is absent, Thr308 could be phosphorylated by PDK1 within the cytosolic complex. Thus, for maintenance of PKB in a Thr308-dephosphorylated state under basal conditions, its PH and kinase domains are predicted to interact to obscure Thr308 accessibility.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>PKB PH and Catalytic Domains Interact in the PKB Inactive State</title><p>To test the above hypothesis and determine the possible interactive sites of the PH and kinase domains, molecular modeling was exploited. The calculations of lipophilicity potentials of the PH and kinase domains resulted in finding two isolated hydrophobic patches that were located on the kinase domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050095-g002">Figure 2</xref>A, in blue). On the PH domain, four small hydrophobic patches were found (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050095-g002">Figure 2</xref>A, in cyan) and were located on the same side of the protein. To test the validity of this molecular model, the electrostatic potential maps of each domain were calculated. The complementarity observed between the positive (red) and negative (blue) lobes for the two domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050095-g002">Figure 2</xref>B) was almost perfect. The upper positive lobe of the PH domain corresponded to the upper negative lobe of the kinase domain, and reciprocally, the negative lobe on the PH domain corresponded to a positive lobe on the kinase domain. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050095-g002">Figure 2</xref>C shows the complementarity between the acidic and the basic residues in the kinase and PH domains of PKB. The yellow arrows indicate the pair of complementary residues on each domain. The fit of the hydrophobic interactions predicts that the Trp80 on the PH domain, at the extremity of the variable loop 3, inserts inside a deep cleft in the kinase domain around residues Lys297, Glu298, and Glu314 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050095-g002">Figure 2</xref>D). Furthermore, the crystal structure of the isolated PKB PH domain showed that Trp80 may have an important role in the interaction of the two domains of PKB &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050095-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>From the complementarity of the basic and acidic residues located around Trp80 in the PH and kinase domains, it was envisaged that mutations of these regions would disrupt the docking of these domains. The region where Trp80 interacts in the kinase domain is indicated by an orange arrow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050095-g002">Figure 2</xref>C). The two polar residues Gln79 and Thr82, surrounding Trp80, were mutated to Glu. These mutations were predicted to result in disruption of the two domains since the acidic residues repulse one another instead of the polar residues of the PH domain interacting with acidic residues of the kinase domain.</p><p>To monitor and validate in situ our hypothesis on the docking sites of PKB-PH and kinase domains and specifically the Gln79Glu/Thr82Glu mutant (PKB-EE mutant), a PKB reporter was constructed. Full-length PKB&#x003b1; with EGFP on the N terminus and monomeric red fluorescent protein (mRFP) on the C terminus (GFP-PKB-RFP) was genetically encoded. Variations in PKB conformation were monitored by changes in FRET efficiency. NIH3T3 cells were transfected with PKB tagged only with GFP to use as the reference lifetime (GFP-PKB) or with the double-tagged GFP-PKB-RFP reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050095-g002">Figure 2</xref>E). Under basal conditions, a change in GFP lifetime and FRET efficiency in the GFP-PKB-RFP reporter construct was monitored (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050095-g002">Figure 2</xref>E, box and whiskers plots). The dynamics of the double-tagged reporter is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050095-sg005">Figure S5</xref>. It is of note that double-tagged PKB can be phosphorylated on both Thr308 and Ser473 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050095-g002">Figure 2</xref>F). The FRET signal under basal conditions was indicative of the close proximity of the two domains in the inactive conformer of PKB. Upon the expression of the Gln79Glu/Thr82Glu mutant (GFP-PKB EE-RFP), a further decrease in the lifetime of the reporter (red lifetime distribution curve) was detected and the FRET efficiency significantly increased to 5.2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050095-g002">Figure 2</xref>E, box and whiskers plots). As predicted from molecular model, the double-Glu mutation perturbed the juxtaposition of the PH and kinase domains as reflected in this altered N-terminal to C-terminal FRET (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050095-g002">Figure 2</xref>E).</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Phosphoinositide-Dependent PKB Conformation Change at the Plasma Membrane</title><p>The molecular model implied that a close interaction between the PH and kinase domains was formed as predicted from the complementary surfaces and shown by the extremely significant variations in FRET efficiency between wild-type and mutant PKB. This inactive conformer will be referred to as the &#x0201c;PH-in&#x0201d; conformation. In order for PDK1 to access Thr308, it was predicted that the PH domain alters its association with the kinase domain on binding to lipids, i.e., a &#x0201c;PH-out&#x0201d; conformation.</p><p>To test this hypothesis, the GFP-PKB-RFP reporter was expressed in NIH3T3 cells and its behaviour was monitored upon stimulation with PDGF. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050095-g003">Figure 3</xref>A illustrates that PDGF induced a change in the conformation of PKB concomitant with its translocation to the plasma membrane. The lifetime distribution curves demonstrated the changes in lifetime (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050095-g003">Figure 3</xref>B), as did the FRET efficiencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050095-g003">Figure 3</xref>C). By separating the plasma membrane pixels from those of the cytoplasm, the mean FRET efficiency of each compartment was calculated to be 7.0 and 4.8, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050095-g003">Figure 3</xref>C, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.0006). The cytoplasmic FRET efficiency in PDGF-treated cells in this acute response was similar to basal level FRET efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050095-g003">Figure 3</xref>C), indicating that the &#x0201c;PH-in&#x0201d; conformer, unless recruited to the plasma membrane, remained unchanged. Pretreatment with LY294002 inhibited the conformational change in wild-type PKB as seen by the overlap of the distribution curves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050095-g003">Figure 3</xref>B, green and dashed green lines). Similarly, the nonbinding PH domain mutant of PKB (RFP-PKB R25C-RFP) was not recruited to the plasma membrane and did not change conformation upon stimulation with PDGF (unpublished data). In conclusion, the association of the PH domain with phosphoinositides at the plasma membrane induced a change in PKB conformation by stabilising the &#x0201c;PH-out&#x0201d; conformer and so permitting Thr308 phosphorylation.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>PKB Conformation Dynamics Revealed in Live Cells</title><p>It has been suggested that PKB in its active state dissociates from the membrane and can phosphorylate soluble targets &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050095-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;. However, the &#x0201c;PH-in&#x0201d; conformer may be obscuring its substrate-binding pocket so that PKB's downstream targets will not have access to it. Thus, we speculated that upon dissociation from the plasma membrane, phosphorylated PKB would remain in a &#x0201c;PH-out&#x0201d; conformer where it can phosphorylate cytosolic substrates. To follow the dynamics of the &#x0201c;PH-out&#x0201d; conformer on dissociation from the plasma membrane, the behaviour of the PKB conformation reporter (GFP-PKB-RFP) was assessed in live cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050095-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Cells were transfected with the reporter, and upon stimulation with PDGF, images were acquired every 54 s for up to 20 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050095-g004">Figure 4</xref>A). The intensity images and the quantification of fluorescence intensity illustrated a replenishment of the cytoplasmic fluorescence, which coincided with a decrease in the fluorescence intensity at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050095-g004">Figure 4</xref>B) upon recruitment of PKB. The lifetime maps show that the translocated PKB changed conformation, and over time, the populations of the shorter lifetime pixels were augmented in the cytoplasm and the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050095-g004">Figure 4</xref>A). The quantification of these lifetime variations in six different experiments demonstrated that the mean FRET efficiency, upon stimulation, increased gradually over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050095-g004">Figure 4</xref>C). This indicated that during the 20 min of filming, the de novo PDGF-activated &#x0201c;PH-out&#x0201d; PKB conformer dissociated from the membrane and became distributed in the cytoplasm and the nucleus.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>Assembling these observations produces a new molecular model for PKB activation dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050095-g004">Figure 4</xref>D). Prior to stimulation, PKB and PDK1 form a complex in the cytoplasm that is in constant equilibrium between the associated and dissociated forms. Under basal conditions, PKB is maintained in its inactive form by the interaction of its PH and kinase domains (&#x0201c;PH-in&#x0201d;). The &#x0201c;PH-in&#x0201d; conformation is responsible for preventing the phosphorylation of Thr308 by the associated PDK1. The cytoplasmic and membrane interactions of PKB and PDK1 are similar in nature. These proteins are in dynamic equilibrium, and it is their corecruitment that concentrates them at the plasma membrane to shift the equilibrium state and form more complex at this location. PKB PH domain interaction with phosphoinositides and its concomitant change in conformation (&#x0201c;PH-out&#x0201d;) form the critical step that allows the associated, corecruited PDK1 to phosphorylate Thr308.</p><p>In live cells, the dynamics of PKB activation shows that it remains in the &#x0201c;PH-out&#x0201d; conformer upon dissociation from the plasma membrane. Active PKB accumulates in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus. This observation suggests that the phosphorylated kinase domain has a lower affinity for the PH domain, thereby sustaining the &#x0201c;PH-out&#x0201d; conformer, whereas the dephosphorylated kinase domain has a higher affinity for the PH domain. This higher affinity for the PH domain, in the inactive form of PKB, maintains the &#x0201c;PH-in&#x0201d; conformer. The &#x0201c;PH-out&#x0201d; conformer probably sustains its activity until phosphatases render it inactive; once inactivated by dephosphorylation, the &#x0201c;PH-out&#x0201d; conformer returns to the &#x0201c;PH-in&#x0201d; conformation. Aside from providing a rationale for observations related to the mechanism of PKB activation, this detailed model makes interesting predictions regarding the potential sites for influencing PKB and its activation. Specifically, it is predicted that compounds influencing the &#x0201c;PH-in&#x0201d; versus &#x0201c;PH-out&#x0201d; conformers will influence the activation state of PKB. This may have implications both in cancer where PKB is aberrantly activated and in diabetes where transient PKB activation might be insulinomimetic.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Materials and antibodies.</title><p>Mowiol 4&#x02013;88, LY294002 in solution, okadaic acid, and sodium salt were from Calbiochem (Merck KGaA, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.merck.de">http://www.merck.de</ext-link>).

The fluorescence lifetime of the donor (&#x003c4;<sub>D</sub>) was obtained by fitting the intensity decay with a monoexponential fit. When cells were transfected with both EGFP-PDK1 and mRFP-PKB, two distinct populations can be considered in first approximation. The first one consists of the noninteracting EGFP-PDK1, with a fluorescence lifetime &#x003c4;<sub>D</sub>. The second consists of the interacting EGFP-PDK1 with mRFP-PKB. The formation of the complex EGFP-PDK1/mRFP-PKB leads to a transfer of energy from the donor to the acceptor, inducing a decrease in the fluorescence lifetime of EGFP-PDK1. When measuring the fluorescence intensity decay of EGFP-PDK1 within the cell, photons from both interacting and noninteracting EGFP-PDK1 were collected. Similarly, when transfected with EGFP-PKB-mRFP, the conformational change of the fusion protein leads to a variation of the FRET efficiency due to a variation of distance between the two fluorescent proteins. In both types of experiments, the intensity decays should follow a multiexponential law. However, biexponential fits necessitate a high signal-to-noise ratio. A minimum photon count of 1,000 at the maximum of the intensity decay is required. Considering the limitations inherent to experiments in cells, such as photobleaching and low concentration of EGFP, the number of photons was insufficient to accurately proceed with a multiexponential analysis. Moreover, to accurately identify the contribution of two lifetimes, it is preferable that they differ by at least a factor of 2, which is generally not the case with GFP-like fluorescent proteins. Therefore, to detect FRET, we measured the relative variation of lifetime obtained from monoexponential fit &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050095-b029">29</xref>&#x0005d;.

The lag in the emitted fluorescence signal permits measurement of phase (&#x003c4;<sub>p</sub>) and modulation depth (&#x003c4;<sub>m</sub>) of the fluorescence. The lifetime, &#x0003c;&#x003c4;&#x0003e;, is the average of phase shift and relative modulation depth (&#x003c4;<sub>m</sub> &#x0002b; &#x003c4;<sub>p</sub>)/2 of the emitted fluorescence signal.

In this structure, only the two first amino acids were lacking and were not rebuilt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050095-g005">Figure 5</xref>). There is no available structure for the kinase domain of human Akt-1 (PKB&#x003b1;), but there are several structures for the homolog human Akt-2 kinase domain (PKB&#x003b2;). Among them, one of the most complete is 1GZN with a resolution of 2.5 &#x000c5; &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050095-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;. In this side chain, the following amino acids are lacking: 146&#x02013;147, 198&#x02013;206, 253, 296, and 442. These were rebuilt prior to any experiment using the Homology module of Insight II (Accelrys, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.accelrys.com">http://www.accelrys.com</ext-link>). Because the two proteins (Akt-1 and Akt-2) have a very high homology rate (98.8&#x00025; with 82.3&#x00025; of strict identity), building a model from this homology sequence was straightforward. Moreover, in the chosen alignment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050095-g005">Figure 5</xref>), there is a difference of only one amino acid between the two sequences that results from a two&#x02013;amino acid deletion after position 114 and a one&#x02013;amino acid insertion at position 268 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050095-g005">Figure 5</xref>, arrows). Alignment of sequences was performed using the Homology multiple-sequence aligner software via the PAM (120 or 250) matrices or the ClustalW software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/clustalw">http://www.ebi.ac.uk/clustalw</ext-link>) as implemented within Homology module. In these latter cases, alignments were performed using the Blosum and Gonnet matrices. The crude model of each domain, after full protonation at pH 7.4, was refined by several cycles of splice repairs on the loops and relaxation on the SCR's side by 100 steps of Steepest Descent and 500 cycles of conjugate gradient. Small 5-ps molecular dynamics runs were performed on each loop in order to relax the strains. Finally, the entire backbone was fixed and the side chains were fully minimised with conjugate gradient method until a root-mean-square of 0.1 kcal/&#x000c5;/mol was obtained. The minimisation process was resumed by applying a tethering constraint to the backbone. This constraint was slowly lowered (starting with a 100 kcal/&#x000c5;/mol) force constant) in a stepwise manner so that at each step the energy of the root-mean-square gradient was less than 0.1 0.1 kcal/&#x000c5;/mol (steps are 100, 50, 25, 10, and 0 0.1 kcal/&#x000c5;/mol).</p></sec><sec id="s4l"><title>Molecular modeling: Potential maps calculations.</title><p>Lipophilicity potentials were calculated using a previously described software &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050095-b032">32</xref>&#x0005d; that calculated on each node of a 1-&#x000c5; cubic grid the sum of the lipophilicity contribution of each nonhydrogen atom as a function of distance. On the kinase domain, a unique patch of hydrophobic potential is located on the same side as the ATP active site with the following amino acids: Leu316, Leu321, Lys356 (alkyl chain only), Phe358, Leu362, and Met363. For the PH domain, four small hydrophobic patches are also located on the same side of the protein and on a &#x0201c;plateau&#x0201d; with the following amino acids: Val4, Tyr18, Ile19, Leu52, and Trp80.</p><p>The Molecular Electrostatic Potential (MEP) maps were drawn within the software PYMOL (version 0.97) after calculations performed using the implemented APBS plug-in.

The Trp80 at the extremity of a loop inserts precisely inside a deep cleft in the kinase domain with Lys297, Glu298, and Glu314 located around it. Moreover, in this configuration, the C terminus of the PH domain is on the same side as the N terminus of the kinase domain. In this model, the PH domain completely blocks the entry of the ATP active site and Thr308 will not be accessible.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pbio-0050095-sg001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><title>PKB&#x02013;PDK1 Interaction Monitored by Frequency Domain FLIM</title><p>(A) Fluorescence frequency domain FLIM images of NIH3T3 cells transfected with GFP-PDK1 alone or GFP-PDK1 together with HA-PKB as indicated.

NIH3T3 cells were transfected with GFP-PDK1 alone or with RFP-PKB. The lifetimes are presented in pseudo-colour scale ranging from 2.0 to 2.7 ns. The graph presents the lifetime distributions of the cells for the following conditions: GFP-PDK1 (blue), GFP-PDK1 with RFP-PKB prior (green) and upon PDGF stimulation (orange). The red and the light green lines indicate the lifetime distributions of the plasma membrane and cytoplasm pixels, respectively, after separation of the compartmental pixels (see decomposition).</p><p>(B) NIH3T3 cells were transfected either with GFP-PKB alone or together with RFP-PKB. The FRET efficiency variation is statistically insignificant.</p><p>(C) The statistical analysis of experiments in A and B are presented as box and whiskers plots (see Supporting Information).

The top panels represent intensity images of the donor GFP chromophore in the transfected cell after two photon excitation. The bottom panels represent the calculated lifetime maps of GFP-PKB-RFP over time. After treatment with 60 ng/ml PDGF, cells were observed under the microscope. Acquisition took place once the construct had translocated to the membrane. The lifetimes are represented in pseudo-colour scale ranging from 2.27 to 2.64 ns.</p><p>(B) The variations of fluorescence intensity at the plasma membrane (red squares) in the cytoplasm (blue circles) and in the nucleus (black triangles) were detected over time.</p><p>(C) The time-course graph presents the enrichment in short lifetime pixels of six different experiments. Each coloured triangle presents a cell. The enrichment of short lifetime pixels is calculated as described in Supporting Information.</p><p>(D) Under basal conditions, PKB and PDK1 form a complex in the cytoplasm where the associated and dissociated forms are in dynamic equilibrium. Four possible equilibrium states of PKB&#x02013;PDK1 complex in its inactive conformation are represented. In the PKB inactive conformation, PKB PH and kinase domains interact, noted as &#x0201c;PH-in.&#x0201d; The equilibrium between a &#x0201c;tighter&#x0201d; and a &#x0201c;looser&#x0201d; interaction of PKB PH with its kinase domain is also represented. Upon PDGF stimulation, the PKB&#x02013;PDK1 complex is recruited to the plasma membrane due to interaction with phosphoinositides (in red). The equilibrium of PKB&#x02013;PDK1 interaction is shifted toward the associated form, a process compromised by LY294002. The interaction of PKB PH domain with the lipids induces a change in conformation of PKB, noted as &#x0201c;PH-out.&#x0201d; In this conformation, Thr308 becomes accessible to PDK1 (the phosphorylation sites are represented by yellow circles). After Ser473 phosphorylation and loading of ATP, PKB dissociates from the plasma membrane in its active conformation to return to the cytoplasm and the nucleus. PKB re-adopts an inactive conformation upon dephosphorylation of its Thr308 and Ser473 sites.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pbio.0050095.g004"/></fig><fig id="pbio-0050095-g005" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Sequence Alignment between Akt-1 and Akt-2 Kinase Domain</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pbio.0050095.g005"/></fig></sec><fn-group><fn id="n104" fn-type="present-address"><p>&#x000a4; Current address: Cell Signaling Laboratory, Cancer Research Institute, College of Medicine, Chungnam National University, Taejon, South Korea</p></fn><fn id="ack3" fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Competing interests.</bold> The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.</p></fn><fn id="ack1" fn-type="con"><p><bold>Author contributions.</bold> VC, DA, and BL were involved in the design and performed the FRET experiments.
