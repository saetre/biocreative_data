We have recently identified <italic>UPAR </italic>as an asthma susceptibility gene and there is evidence to suggest that uPAR may be upregulated in lung diseases such as COPD and asthma. uPAR is a key receptor involved in the formation of the serine protease plasmin by interacting with uPA and has been implicated in many physiological processes including proliferation and migration. The current aim was to determine key regulatory regions and splice variants of <italic>UPAR </italic>and quantify its expression in primary human tissues and cells (including lung, bronchial epithelium (HBEC), airway smooth muscle (HASM) and peripheral cells).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Using Rapid Amplification of cDNA Ends (RACE) a conserved transcription start site (-42 to -77 relative to ATG) was identified and multiple transcription factor binding sites predicted. Seven major splice variants were identified (&#x0003e;5% total expression), including multiple exon deletions and an alternative exon 7b (encoding a truncated, soluble, 229aa protein). Variants were differentially expressed, with a high proportion of E7b usage in lung tissue and structural cells (55&#x02013;87% of transcripts), whereas classical exon 7 (encoding the GPI-linked protein) was preferentially expressed in peripheral cells (~80% of transcripts), often with exon 6 or 5+6 deletions. Real-time PCR confirmed expression of uPAR mRNA in lung, as well as airway and peripheral cell types with ~50&#x02013;100 fold greater expression in peripheral cells versus airway cells and confirmed RACE data. Protein analysis confirmed expression of multiple different forms of uPAR in the same cells as well as expression of soluble uPAR in cell supernatants. The pattern of expression did not directly reflect that seen at the mRNA level, indicating that post-translational mechanisms of regulation may also play an important role.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have identified multiple uPAR isoforms in the lung and immune cells and shown that expression is cell specific. These data provide a novel mechanism for uPAR regulation, as different exon splicing may determine uPAR function <italic>e.g</italic>. alternative E7b results in a soluble isoform due to the loss of the GPI anchor and exon deletions may affect uPA (ligand) and/or integrin binding and therefore influence downstream pathways. Expression of different isoforms within the lung should be taken into consideration in studies of uPAR in respiratory disease.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The plasminogen pathway and specifically the urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) has been of interest in the cancer field for some time (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]). The uPAR protein has been shown to be over-expressed in many different cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], whilst an exon 4&#x02013;5 deleted mRNA has been shown to be over-expressed in breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>The uPAR protein is a modulator of the plasminogen pathway, which cleaves and activates urokinase (uPA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. uPAR-uPA is involved in the proteolytic activation of plasminogen to plasmin, which in turn degrades fibrin and other ECM components and activates matrix metalloproteases. However uPAR has many other roles (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]), acting via both intra- and extra- cellular signalling pathways. For instance, soluble uPAR fragments have chemotactic activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], whilst uPAR interacts with integrins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and G-protein coupled receptors to signal within the cell via intracellular kinases. These many interactions explain the position of uPAR as a key player in tissue remodelling, proliferation and cell migration, in both normal and disease states [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>A key feature of many respiratory diseases, including asthma, is airway remodelling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. From the known biology of uPAR, this receptor is potentially involved in tissue remodelling and may be predicted to influence decline in lung function, due to its role in ECM remodelling, proliferation and migration of several cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Recently we have performed linkage and association analyses utilising three populations including 587 UK and Dutch asthma families and identified the urokinase plasminogen activator receptor gene (<italic>uPAR </italic>or <italic>PLAUR</italic>) as an asthma susceptibility gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. We have shown that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) spanning <italic>UPAR </italic>determine the rate of decline in FEV1 and are also determinants of soluble uPAR in the serum of asthma subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In addition, uPAR has been shown to be up-regulated in lung epithelium in severe/fatal asthma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], whilst soluble uPAR was found to be elevated in the sputum in multiple respiratory diseases (asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and cystic fibrosis) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. A gene profiling study also showed uPAR expression was related to reduced lung function in COPD patients, with increased staining for the uPAR protein in the airway epithelium of airflow obstructed patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Therefore our previous data and data from others suggest that levels of uPAR expression may be important in multiple respiratory diseases.</p><p>The uPAR protein has three domains and is bound to the membrane via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor; however it may also be found as a soluble form due to cleavage of the GPI anchor and both membrane bound and soluble forms may be cleaved by various proteases, including uPA to give D1 and D2/3 fragments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The human airway trypsin-like protease (HAT) expressed in airway epithelium can cleave both membrane bound and soluble uPAR at the D1/D2 linker [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], resulting in release of the D1 fragment. The mature uPAR protein consists of three similar domains which assemble to create a globular structure almost surrounding a central cavity in which uPA binds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Specific residues have been determined to be involved in binding uPA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] and integrins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] as well as having chemotactic functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Schematic representation of uPAR structure</bold>. <italic>UPAR </italic>consists of seven exons, with an alternative exon 7b previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. The classical form is transcribed to give a three domain protein which can be membrane bound, via a GPI anchor. Domain S: Signal peptide removed during processing, Domain G: removed during processing to give GPI anchor at new <italic>C-</italic>terminus. Different regions of each domain involved in various protein-protein interactions are highlighted, which may give an indication of the functions of variant forms of the receptor. uPA binding involves residues in all three domains (see Figure 4), with key binding regions in D1 and D2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The minimum chemotactic sequence is located in the D1-D2 linker [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], A region implicated in binding integrins &#x003b1;1&#x003b2;3 and &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1, aiding signalling to vitronectin, which also has chemotactic activity is located in D2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>].

Exon 1 encodes the 5'UTR and a signal peptide, whilst exons 2&#x02013;3, 4&#x02013;5 and 6&#x02013;7 encode the homologous protein domains D1, D2 and D3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Use of an alternative exon 7 (described hereafter as exon 7b) has been reported and results in replacement of the terminal 75 amino acids with a novel 21 residues; this variant cannot gain a GPI anchor and thus encodes a soluble form of the receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Variants lacking exons 5 and 4+5 have also been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. The exon 5 variant was originally identified from a HeLa cDNA library whilst the exon 4+5 deletion was identified in various cancer cell lines using a limited PCR design. To date no comprehensive evaluation of splice variation of uPAR has been completed.</p><p>Due to the increasing interest in uPAR expression in lung diseases, the current study aimed to characterise the <italic>UPAR </italic>gene and identify cell specific transcription initiation sites as well as to identify and quantify splice isoforms in cells and tissues from the lung and periphery. These data provide definitive answers regarding the type and extent of uPAR splice variation and generate a greater insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying the expression and activity of uPAR in the normal lung and immune cells, which may in turn have implications for the role of this receptor in airway disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title><italic>UPAR</italic> has a localised transcriptional start site that shows limited cell specificity</title><p>The transcriptional start sites (TSS) for <italic>UPAR </italic>were determined by 5' RACE in a panel of six human tissues/cell types (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). In lung tissue, human airway smooth muscle cells (HASM), polymorphonuclear cells (PMN) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), the dominant TSS was located at -46 to -52 bp relative to the start codon, however the major TSS in differentiated human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEC) was at -75 bp and a further two minor sites were identified at -42 to -44 (in PMN/PBMC) and at -64 to -69 (all except differentiated HBEC). Differences in TSS usage between tissues/cells were significant (Chi-square, p &#x0003c; 0.001). A shortlist of transcription factors relevant to respiratory disease and asthma was generated by reference to the literature and a 4 kb upstream fragment analysed for potential transcription factor binding sites using four different on-line databases. Consensus sites for c/EBP (9), AP-1 (1), GATA (9), NF-AT (2), STAT (6) and RXR (1) were identified (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Identification and characterisation of the uPAR promoter</bold>.

Those sites identified in two or more different searches are shown.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2199-10-75-2"/></fig></sec><sec><title>uPAR is expressed in multiple splice forms in the lung and periphery</title><p>To identify splice variants and determine the exon structure of uPAR, 5' and 3' RACE were completed in six different tissues/cell types (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). 5' RACE identified a localised TSS (see earlier) and demonstrated that exons 1 and 2 were conserved in all cells/tissues (data not shown). An exon 3 deletion variant was identified at low frequency in differentiated HBEC (4.5% of clones sequenced), PMN (4.5%) and PBMC (4.3%). 3' RACE confirmed the expression of the classical exon 7 as well as the alternative exon 7b, which was present with a truncated or extended 3'UTR (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). The pattern of expression of splice variants differed between tissues/cell types (Chi-square p &#x0003c; 0.001). Several exon deletion variants were identified including; exon 5, 6 and 5+6 deletions, although only the exon 6 deletion had a frequency &#x0003e;5% (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). In addition PCR products spanning exons 1&#x02013;7 and 1&#x02013;7b were cloned and sequenced to determine which exon deletions were found in combination with the two alternative terminal exons, demonstrating that an additional exon 4+5 deletion exists (data not shown). Interestingly, the structural cell types (HASM, HBEC) and lung appeared to express mostly exon 7b (55&#x02013;87% of clones sequenced), encoding a soluble variant of uPAR, whilst more classical membrane bound uPAR (&#x02248; 80%) was detected in the peripheral cells (PMN and PBMC) (when all exon deleted forms were pooled). In RACE, exon-deleted transcripts were cloned from all cell types except differentiated HBEC and HASM. These results were confirmed by full-length PCR, when no exon-deleted forms were obtained for differentiated HBEC and 2/48 clones for HASM, which would not have been detectable by RACE based on primer design (del3 and del4+5). Lung tissue showed 8% exon deleted clones in the RACE analysis; these were exon 5 or 6 deletions, in combination with exon 7b. Of the lung cells, undifferentiated HBEC showed the largest number of exon-deleted forms (7/44 clones analysed, 16%), which included three unique clones showing non-classical splice sites (data not shown). The two peripheral cell types analysed showed high frequencies of exon deleted forms in the RACE analysis (PMN: 14/22, 64%; PBMC: 10/21, 48%). These were predominantly exon 6 deletions, although del5 and del5+6 were also observed. PCR analysis of PBMC confirmed these data with 16/24 exon1&#x02013;7 clones showing exon deletions (including del6 (5/24), del5 (4/34) and del5+6 (3/24)) and 4/24 exon 1&#x02013;7b clones showing deletions (including del6 (1/24) and del5 (2/24)). All classical exon deletions are in frame deletions.

D1 proteolytic fragments (expected molecular weight 10&#x02013;20 kDa) were not detected, probably due to their relatively small molecular weight. The highest molecular weight protein seen in all cell types (60 kDa) probably represents full-length classical uPAR as it corresponds most closely to the band observed for recombinant uPAR and by others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].

The current study aimed to characterise the key regulatory regions of <italic>UPAR</italic>, identify all common splice variation and quantify expression in the normal lung and in specific lung and peripheral cells at the mRNA and protein levels. We have identified a localised TSS with some cell specificity and confirmed expression of uPAR in lung and peripheral cells. At the mRNA level, multiple uPAR splice variants were identified including alternative E7 (E7b) and deletions of E3, E5+6 and E6, and their patterns of expression in different tissues/cell types characterised. Primary peripheral cells (PMN and PBMC) expressed multiple exon deleted forms of membrane bound uPAR, whilst lung cells including epithelium and airway smooth muscle expressed a greater proportion of an alternative soluble uPAR with and without an exon 4+5 deletion. Protein analyses confirmed expression of multiple differentially expressed forms of uPAR in all cell extracts, and soluble uPAR was detected in the supernatants of cultured HASM, HBEC, THP1 and BEAS2B cells. Specificity of the Western blotting analyses was confirmed by siRNA. Our data provide a novel insight into the molecular mechanisms that potentially regulate uPAR expression and activity in the airways and the periphery which has implications regarding the potential role of uPAR in airway disease biology.</p><p>Previous analyses in cell lines suggested the TSS of <italic>UPAR </italic>is 52 bp upstream of the ATG, with a minor start site around -77 bp in U937 (monocytes) and HeLa (epithelial) cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. We have now confirmed and extended these initial analyses using tissues and cells of the respiratory and immune systems; namely lung, HASM, HBEC, PMN and PBMC. In all samples the TSS was located between -42 and -77, however there were clear cell specific locations within this interval <italic>i.e</italic>. -46 to -52 is the dominant TSS in most cells and lung tissue but not in HBEC where the -75 to -78 locus is dominant. The functional significance of the cell specific TSS usage remains to be resolved although it is interesting to note that functional studies using promoter-reporter approaches have suggested that most transcriptional activity is found in the first 220 bp upstream of the ATG in HeLa, HCT116 and RKO (colon cancer) cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Functional studies have implicated AP1 (-122) and SP1-like motifs (spanning -139 to -154) as being important for basal uPAR transcription in colon cancer and HeLa cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. We used data-mining to characterise relevant transcription factor binding sites in the 4 kb promoter region identifying a number of different potential pro-inflammatory transcription factor binding sites including AP1, STAT, GATA and CCAAT/EBP sites using two or more databases. Only a single AP1 (-236) site and no SP1 sites were replicated, despite their known importance, indicating that some sites may be missed using our replication strategy, however, the AP1 (-122) and SP1 (-151) sites identified in functional studies were detected by individual databases. uPAR expression has been shown to be regulated by a number of growth factors at the transcriptional level, which include TGF&#x003b2;1 utilizing the AP1 site at -236 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. TGF&#x003b2;1 is a pro-fibrotic cytokine that has been implicated in airway remodelling in asthma and therefore it is tempting to speculate that TGF&#x003b2;1 induction of uPAR may be a significant mechanism involved in airway remodelling.</p><p>The second objective of the current study was to determine uPAR splice variation in airway and peripheral cells using real-time PCR. Two donors were used for each cell type (but not tissues), to allow for inter-individual differences. We observed expression of the previously identified uPAR E7b soluble splice variant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], which is predicted to result in the loss of the GPI anchor, in the lung and periphery. Interestingly the primary peripheral cells expressed low levels of this variant (as a fraction of total uPAR) compared to the lung tissue and cells. This suggests that peripheral cells could retain more of their uPAR at the cell membrane (GPI-bound) whilst lung structural cells produce more soluble, secreted uPAR. Binding of uPA to membrane bound uPAR initiates many intracellular signalling pathways, resulting in outcomes including differentiation, proliferation and cell motility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], whilst soluble uPAR can act as a chemoattractant for hematopoietic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. It is therefore possible that airway cells might express more soluble uPAR to allow them to attract cells into the airways, whilst the peripheral cells express mainly the surface form of the receptor to allow them to respond to external signals.</p><p>In addition to the exon7 variants we also identified a series of internal exon deletion variants expressed within the context of both the membrane bound and soluble receptor. These included exon 3, 4+5, 5+6 and 6 deletions. Exon deleted forms of classical uPAR were found most frequently in the primary peripheral cells, PMN and PBMC. Exon 6 deletion was the most widely expressed. Loss of exon 6 would disrupt the structure of D3, particularly as it includes one of the key cysteines involved in disulphide bonding. This would be expected to lead to reduced uPA binding affinity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] as two amino acid residues shown to be involved in uPA binding are located in this exon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Expression of an exon 4+5 deleted variant of uPAR has previously been described and was shown to be associated with shorter disease-free survival in breast cancers using a real-time PCR strategy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], however the assay used did not distinguish between exon 7 variants. In the present study, we did not detect this deletion in combination with classical exon 7 using real-time PCR (although a single clone was obtained from PBMC by PCR), whereas in combination with alternative exon 7b this variant was detected in most tissues/cell types, notably the structural cells HASM, HBEC and BEAS2B. Based on the known structure of uPAR, this variant might express a soluble form of the receptor lacking the key chemotactic sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] and D2, which includes integrin binding domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Some uPA binding ability conferred by D1 may be retained [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] although many uPA binding residues will be lost [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] and the structure of the protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] will be compromised. It is possible that this form might act as a dominant-negative inhibitor of uPAR action, by sequestering uPA and preventing its binding to full length membrane-bound or soluble forms of the receptor.</p><p>Repeated epithelial wounding/repair leading to airway remodelling has been implicated in asthma pathogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Epithelial cells have the capacity to repair by cell spreading, migration and proliferation, all integrin-dependent processes. Integrins have therefore been suggested to play a prominent role in wound repair in asthma and the expression of &#x003b1;3&#x003b2;1 (laminin receptor) and &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1 (fibronectin receptor) integrins have been shown to be upregulated at epithelial wound edges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. uPAR interacts with integrins (mainly &#x003b1;3&#x003b2;1 and &#x003b1;5&#x003b2;1) and has been shown to influence cell adhesion and migration on ECM proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Therefore the identification of splice variants that lose this ability to bind integrins (<italic>i.e</italic>. exon 5 deletions) may be of significance in normal and disease mechanisms.</p><p>At the protein level, multiple forms of uPAR were detected in cell lysates. Overall, our data suggest that multiple forms of uPAR are expressed in the panel of cells studied and there is some evidence of differential expression. This corresponds to the findings of Brooks <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], who showed predominantly lower molecular weight forms of uPAR to be expressed in peripheral neutrophils, whilst higher molecular weight forms were more highly expressed in lung eosinophils. These data are also in keeping with our mRNA analyses which suggested a higher proportion of exon deletion variants are expressed in the periphery, potentially resulting in lower molecular weight proteins.</p><p>Although the majority of high abundance predicted uPAR variants might be expected to be detected using either the D1 or D2 antibody, the patterns of expression observed were markedly different. This could reflect differing affinities of the two antibodies for different variants. It should be noted that the epitope for the D1 antibody (amino acids 52&#x02013;60) corresponds to one of the potential glycosylation sites for the protein (Asn<sup>52</sup>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. The presence of a large carbohydrate side-chain may prevent binding of the antibody, resulting in detection of fewer forms by this antibody as we have observed. Additionally, the D1 antibody will not detect D2/3 proteolytic fragments, explaining the presence of fewer low molecular weight proteins detected using this antibody. An attempt has been made to mirror patterns of protein expression as determined by Western blot to real-time PCR results, with some success for the D1 antibody results <italic>e.g</italic>. the presence of a 50 kDa protein potentially representing the alternative exon7b observed in all cell types except PMN and PBMC, as well as a 45 kDa form seen only in PBMC and PMN which may represent single exon deletions of classical uPAR. Concordance between the two assays may be affected by differing efficiencies of the real-time PCR assays or antibody specificity. However, it will also reflect genuine biological differences, as post-translational control mechanisms including glycosylation and proteolytic cleavage play a key role in uPAR protein maturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Our data reflect this complex regulatory pathway.</p><p>All cultured cells tested showed expression of soluble uPAR. This assay does not distinguish between classical uPAR released from its GPI anchor, proteolytic fragments and alternatively spliced (exon 7b) soluble uPAR. However, all of these cell lines expressed relatively high proportions of alternative uPAR(E7b) mRNA and the level of mRNA correlates with soluble uPAR protein expression <italic>e.g</italic>. BEAS2B and THP1 had elevated alternative uPAR(E7b) mRNA and soluble uPAR protein. Therefore, the elevated levels of uPAR in the sputum of asthma and COPD subjects may reflect expression of soluble uPAR from both epithelial and smooth muscle cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have identified the key promoter region of <italic>UPAR </italic>in the airway and highlighted potential regulatory transcription factor binding sites. We have identified multiple splice variants with potentially different functional activity including soluble expression and/or the loss of key binding domains, such as those involved in ligand binding or integrin interactions. The expression patterns of these splice variants in airway and peripheral cells provide an insight into the molecular mechanisms regulating uPAR expression and activity. These data highlight the importance of uPAR splice variants, which should be taken into consideration in future work to determine the role of uPAR in respiratory disease.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell culture, preparation of total RNA and cell protein lysates and siRNA knock-down</title><p>Primary human airway smooth muscle (HASM) cells were isolated and prepared as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] and cultured in DMEM + 10% foetal calf serum (FCS).
