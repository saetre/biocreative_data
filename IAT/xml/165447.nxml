In addition, 30 S precursor molecules contain extra sequences in the beginning and end of structural genes and in between, as well. These additional sequences are removed by a series of processing events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Enzymes involved in rRNA processing have been the subject of extensive studies, but a full understanding of this important process is still incomplete [reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]]).</p><p>RNase III is the best studied enzyme involved in rRNA processing. RNase III is highly conserved in the eubacteria and orthologs occur in fungi, plants and animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In <italic>E. coli </italic>RNase III is encoded by the <italic>rnc </italic>gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], which maps at 55 minutes. It is a double-stranded RNA specific enzyme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], which is active as a 52 kDa homodimer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and requires a divalent metal ion (preferably Mg<sup>2+</sup>) for activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In addition to the secondary structure of substrate RNA, both positive (determinants) and negative (antideterminants) sequence elements are important in determining the cleavage site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>In <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, sequences flanking both 16 S RNA and 23 S RNA contain complementary sequence tracts that can form double-stranded regions enclosing the sequences of the mature species of 16 S and 23 S [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. These helices are known as processing stems. As a result of RNase III cleavage, pre-16 S and pre-23 S precursor molecules are released [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. This event has been shown to occur during transcription of rRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Only 1&#x02013;2% of rRNA is present as long precursors in wild-type bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The final maturation of rRNA molecules depends on the formation of the complex of rRNA and r-proteins and requires participation of other ribonucleases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>Bacteria lacking RNase III activity are viable, although slow growth and defective translation of some specific mRNA's has been attributed to the lack of the enzyme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In these strains, other ribonucleases are responsible for the formation of 16 S and 23 S precursors. However, these precursors are somewhat larger than the precursors formed by RNase III cleavage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Unlike 16 S rRNA, the mature ends of 23 S rRNA are not formed in the RNase III-negative strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>RNase III processing sites in the 23 S precursor have been localized at 3 and 7 nucleotides upstream from the mature 23 S rRNA 5' terminus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and at 8 nucleotides downstream from the 3' terminus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In 23 S rRNA, initial cleavage by RNase III is indispensable for maturation, and no mature 23 S RNA is found in RNase III&#x000af; strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The mature 5' terminus of 23 S rRNA is formed in ribosomes by an unknown enzyme. This seems to be endoribonuclease, because no intermediates have been observed. The maturation of the 3' terminus requires RNase T [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. RNase III was tought to cleave both strands of the 23 S processing stem simultaneously in a staggered fashion. However, more recently it has been demonstrated, that the maturation of the 5' end of 23 S rRNA occurs independently of that at the 3' terminus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Interestingly, there is a reciprocal dependency between RNase III activity and ribosome assembly, the mature 5' end of 16 S rRNA and both mature ends of 23 S rRNA are known to be formed only in assembled ribosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. On the other hand, a temperature-sensitive mutation in ribosomal protein S12, which affects small subunit assembly, has been found to be suppressed by a mutation in RNase III [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>In the present work we have compared RNase III cleavage sites on different forms of precursor 23 S rRNA <italic>in vitro</italic>. It was found that RNase III cleaves pre-23 S rRNA in ribosomes at position 3 nucleotides upstream from the mature 5' terminus of 23 S rRNA. Deproteinized rRNA from the <italic>rnc</italic><sup>- </sup>strain and <italic>in vitro </italic>transcribed rRNA were cleaved by RNase III at position (-7). Thus, the specificity of RNase III cleavage is altered by the presence of ribosomal proteins. We have also shown that RNase III binds to the ribosomes. Binding to the 70 S ribosomes is stronger when compared to the dissociated subunits.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><p>In order to analyze the possible link between ribosome assembly and RNase III processing events we have isolated ribosomes from RNase III negative and from the wild-type strains. In the absence of RNase III the extended version of 23 S rRNA accumulates in the ribosome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The primer extension identified most of the 5' ends of 23 S rRNA at positions (-42) &#x02013; (-45) (data not shown). However, a significant fraction of the 5' ends were located in the helix 1 region of mature 23 S rRNA (positions 3&#x02013;6). These results are in agreement with the earlier observations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>Pre-23 S rRNA was cleaved by RNase III in the ribosomes and after removal of ribosomal proteins. After treatment of 70 S ribosomes or 50 S subunits with RNase III, the main 5' end of 23 S rRNA was at position (-3) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). In contrast, if ribosomal proteins were removed by phenol extraction, the main RNase III cleavage on the naked pre-23 S rRNA occurred at position (-7), although very little cleavage also occurred at position (-3). The <italic>in vitro </italic>transcribed, unmodified 30 S rRNA precursor from the <italic>rrn</italic>B operon was cleaved by RNase III preferentially at position (-7) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). These results clearly demonstrate that the specificity of RNase III is altered by the presence of ribosomal proteins. It is interesting to note that the RNase III cleavage site in the ribosomes (-3) is closer to the ribosomal body when compared to the cleavage site in the free rRNA (-7). Therefore, the presence of r-proteins in the 50 S subunit does not protect or mask the distal cleavage site. We assume that binding RNase III to the ribosomes directs the cleavage at position (-3).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>RNase III cleavage sites in the 5' strand of pre-23 S rRNA. </bold>70 S ribosomes and 50 S subunits were isolated from the RNase III positive (XL-1B) and from RNase III negative (CAG) strain. The 30 S rRNA precursor was transcribed <italic>in vitro</italic>. Samples were treated with RNase III (+ lanes). Control samples were incubated without the enzyme. RNase III cleavage sites on the 23 S rRNA in the ribosomes or in the naked RNA were determined by a reverse transcriptase primer extension. The sequence of the <italic>rrn</italic>B operon around the 5' end of 23 S rRNA is shown on lines A, C, G, T. RNase III cleavage sites and the mature 5' end of 23 S rRNA are indicated on the right (-7, -3, and 5' 23S).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2199-4-8-1"/></fig><p>Next, we have analyzed the 5' end of 23 S rRNA in the 70 S ribosomes and in the 50 S subunits of the wild-type strain (RNase III positive strain; see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Only the mature 5' end was found in the 70 S ribosomes, while the 50 S subunits contain a significant fraction of 5' ends at position (-3). Final maturation of 23 S rRNA is known to occur in 70 S ribosomes or in polysomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Thus, the 50 S subunits with extended 23 S rRNA represent newly formed 50 S subunits which have not been in 70 S. Moreover, the fact that in the 50 S subunits 23 S rRNA has a 5' end at position (-3) suggests that RNase III cleavage occurs after the 50 S subunits are assembled. Srivastava and Schlessinger have proposed that RNase III cleavage of pre-rRNA occurs on the level of ribonucleoprotein particles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Our results confirm this. The fact that rRNA cleavage by RNase III happens after the r-proteins are associated with the 23 S rRNA supports the view that ribosomal large subunit assembly is coupled to the transcription of 23 S rRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>In similar experiments we have analyzed RNase III cleavage sites on the 3' strand of pre-23 S rRNA. The cleavage sites were determined by S1 nuclease mapping. In the wild-type strain, the 3' end of 23 S rRNA was heterogeneous, in addition to the known 3' end the molecules one or two nucleotides shorter were also found (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Similar heterogeneity at the 3' end of 23 S rRNA was also observed by others (e. g. in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]). When ribosomes were isolated from the wild-type, RNase III treatment did not have any effect on the 3' end of 23 S rRNA either in the ribosomes or in the free rRNA.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>RNase III cleavage sites in the 3' strand of pre-23 S rRNA. </bold>70 S ribosomes, 50 S subunits or <italic>in vitro </italic>transcribed 30 S pre-rRNA were incubated with or without RNase III (+ and - lanes respectively). The cleavage sites were determined by S1 nuclease mapping. Sequencing lanes A, C, G, and T were used to determine of exact length of protected 3' [<sup>32</sup>P]DNA. The positions of the RNase III cleavage and the mature 3' end of 23 S rRNA are indicated on the right.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2199-4-8-2"/></fig><p>50 S subunits isolated from the RNase III-negative strain CAG1632 contain extensions 43, 44, and &#x0003c;45 nucleotides at the 3' end (data not shown). 70 S ribosomes and 50 S subunits, isolated from RNase III-negative strain, were treated by RNase III. Two cleavage sites corresponding to positions (+2) and (+3) in respect of the canonical 3' end of 23 S rRNA were identified by S1 mapping (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). The same cleavage sites were found when the ribosomal proteins were removed prior to the RNase III cleavage reaction. Thus, in contrast to the RNase III cleavage at the 5' end of pre-23 S rRNA, the cleavage at the 3' end is not influenced by the presence of the ribosomal proteins.</p><p>On the <italic>in vitro </italic>transcribed <italic>rrn</italic>B 30 S precursor RNase III cleaves the 23 S rRNA 3' strand at position (+8). This site has been recognized before as the RNase III cleavage site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The results presented here suggest that the RNase III cleavage site before ribosomal assembly is at position (+8). When 50 S subunits are formed, the RNase III cleaves at positions (+2) and (+3).

RNase III has been shown to copurify with ribosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] suggesting physical interaction with the ribosomes. Radioactive RNase III was incubated with ribosomes and passed through the Sephacryl S400 spin column. Approximately 60&#x02013;80% of the 70 S ribosomes are found in the void volume. 12&#x02013;15% of the radioactivity was also present in the ribosomal fraction, while less than 1% of the radioactivity was found in this fraction in the absence of added ribosomes (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). This result indicates significant binding of RNase III to the 70 S ribosomes. The actual binding of RNase III to the 70 S ribosomes can be higher since 20&#x02013;40% of the ribosomes remain in the column. Similar results in RNase III binding were detected with ribosomes from the RNase III-negative strain and the wild type strain.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Association of RNase III with ribosomes and ribosomal subunits.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td></td><td align="left">dpm</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">70 S (CAG1632)</td><td align="left">4507 &#x000b1; 379</td></tr><tr><td align="left">70 S (XL-1B)</td><td align="left">3688 &#x000b1; 345</td></tr><tr><td align="left">50 S</td><td align="left">1241 &#x000b1; 97</td></tr><tr><td align="left">30 S</td><td align="left">1274 &#x000b1; 141</td></tr><tr><td align="left">poly(U)</td><td align="left">541 &#x000b1; 36</td></tr><tr><td align="left">70 S + poly(U)</td><td align="left">2511 &#x000b1; 239</td></tr><tr><td align="left">-</td><td align="left">179 &#x000b1; 34</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>[<sup>35</sup>S]RNase III (30 000 dpm) was incubated with 1 A<sub>260 </sub>unit 70 S ribosomes or with the same amount of isolated subunits followed by separation of ribosomes from unbound radioactivity by a Sephacryl S400 spin column using NH<sub>4</sub>Cl concentration as indicated. Ribosome-bound RNase III was determined by TCA precipitation and counting the precipitate for radioactivity. The results are shown in dpm. In the control experiments 2 A<sub>260 </sub>units of poly(U) was added to the incubation mixture. The control with [<sup>35</sup>S]RNase III alone is also shown. The data presented here are average results of 4 parallel experiments.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>Significant binding of RNase III to both 50 S and 30 S subunits was detected (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Taken together, RNase III binds to the 70 S ribosomes and to both subunits. However, RNase III has a higher affinity to the 70 S ribosomes when compared to the isolated subunits. RNase III is known to bind dsRNA via its C-terminal dsRNA binding domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. It is therefore reasonable to assume that RNase III interacts with the rRNA. The fact that ribosomal proteins alter the specificity of RNase III cleavage reaction suggests direct interaction between RNase III and r-proteins. Thus, both rRNA and r-proteins are likely to participate in RNase III &#x02013; ribosome interaction.</p><p>To further test the specificity of RNase III binding to the ribosomes, we have performed competition experiments. Polyuridylic acid (average 4 S) was used as unspecific competitor RNA. When RNase III was incubated with 2 A<sub>260 </sub>units of poly(U) and passed through the Sephacryl S400 spin column a small amount of RNase III was found in the void volume (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Poly(U) is apparently not big enough to be in the flow-through fraction. Thus, in the presence of poly(U) RNase III remains in the column. When RNase III binding to 70 S ribosomes (1 A<sub>260 </sub>unit) was tested in the presence of 2 A<sub>260 </sub>units poly(U) 5 times more RNase III was found in the ribosome fraction when compared to the poly(U) binding results. Therefore, poly(U) did not efficiently compete with the ribosome for the RNase III binding. We conclude that the binding to the ribosomes is specific.</p><p>The results described above demonstrate that RNase III binds to both isolated ribosomal subunits and with an even higher affinity to the 70 S ribosomes. Such interaction can be important for ribosome biogenesis to facilitate high molecular rRNA processing. The same idea has been published by A. Nicholson [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. On the other hand, the translation of many mRNAs in <italic>E. coli </italic>is regulated by RNase III cleavage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. If translation of an mRNA is coupled to transcription and is regulated by RNase III, the association of the enzyme with the ribosome would enhance the control of translation by RNase III. An example of RNase III regulated mRNA is transcription antitermination factor N of phage &#x003bb;. Recently it has been demonstrated that RNase III cleavage does not inhibit gene N transcription antitermination but prevents N-mediated translation repression of N gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. In this system, the association of RNase III with the 70 S ribosomes can play a role in regulating gene expression at the level of translation. It remains to be tested whether the RNase III associated with 70 S has the same cleavage specificity as the free enzyme.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>1.

Single stranded DNA complementary to the positions 6374&#x02013;6540 (numbering according to [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]) was labelled by [&#x003b1;<sup>32</sup>P]-ddATP using terminal transferse (Fermentas, Lithuania) according to manufacturers recommendations. ccDNA probe (1 pmol) was mixed with 4 pmoles of rRNA and hybridized in 20 &#x003bc;l buffer H (0.1 M HEPES, pH 7,8; 1 mM EDTA; 0.5 M NaCl) at 65&#x000b0;C for 20 min. 300 &#x003bc;l of buffer S (280 mM NaCl; 4.5 mM ZnSO<sub>4</sub>; 50 mM NaOAc pH 4.5; herring sperm DNA 20 &#x003bc;g/ml) and 10 units S1 nuclease (Fermentas, Lithuania) were added. Incubation was 40 min. at 37&#x000b0;C. Reaction was stopped by EDTA/NaCl and phenol extraction of DNA. Products were separated by 10% urea-PAGE.</p></sec><sec><title>RNase III binding to the ribosomes</title><p>Binding of RNase III to the 70 S ribosomes and ribosomal subunits was tested by spin column method. [<sup>35</sup>S]RNase III (30 000 dpm) was incubated with 1 A<sub>260 </sub>unit ribosomes 10 min. on ice in 50 &#x003bc;l buffer B (10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>; 20 mM Tris-HCl ph 7.6; 6 mM 2-ME; 100 mM NH<sub>4</sub>Cl). Ribosome-bound RNase III was separated from free enzyme by 1 ml Sephacryl S-400 (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) spin column equilibrated by the buffer B with corresponding NH<sub>4</sub>Cl concentration. 5% TCA precipitate was collected and counted for radioactivity. In the absence of ribosomes 100&#x02013;200 dpm was found in the flowthrough fraction.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><sec><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank our colleagues for help and advise, MSc &#x000dc;.
