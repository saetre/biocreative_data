Although it is known that macrophages and fibroblasts are co-localized and express MMPs in the diseased periodontal tissue, the effect of interaction between these two cell types on MMP expression has not been well elucidated. Furthermore although it is known that diabetes is associated with accelerated periodontal tissue destruction, it remains unknown whether hyperglycemia, a major metabolic abnormality in diabetes, regulates MMP expression by affecting the cross-talking between fibroblasts and macrophages. In this study, human gingival fibroblasts and U937 macrophages were cocultured in a two-compartment transwell culture system, and the cells were treated with normal or high glucose. We found that coculture of fibroblasts and U937 macrophages led to an augmentation of MMP-1 expression by U937 macrophages, and high glucose further enhanced this augmentation. Similar observations were also made in the coculture of fibroblasts and human primary monocytes. We also found that interleukin 6 (IL-6) released by fibroblasts was essential for the augmentation of MMP-1 expression by U937 macrophages. Furthermore our results showed that high glucose, IL-6, and lipopolysaccharide had a synergistic effect on MMP-1 expression. Finally our study indicated that MAPK pathways and activator protein-1 transcription factor were involved in the coculture- and high glucose-augmented MMP-1 expression. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that IL-6 derived from fibroblasts is essential for MMP-1 up-regulation by cross-talking between fibroblasts and U937 macrophages exposed to high glucose, revealing an IL-6-dependent mechanism in MMP-1 up-regulation.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><label>*</label><p>This work was supported, in whole or in part, by <grant-sponsor>National Institutes of Health</grant-sponsor> Grant <grant-num>DE16353</grant-num> (to Y.

Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs),<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn4">3</xref> a family of proteolytic enzymes that degrade collagen and other matrix proteins including elastin, fibronectin, proteoglycan, and laminin, play an essential role in the periodontal tissue destruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>). MMPs are expressed in inflamed periodontal tissue by inflammatory cells including monocytes, macrophages, lymphocytes, and polymorphonuclear cells and also by resident cells such as fibroblasts, epithelial cells, and endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>). Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) derived from Gram-negative bacteria, the major pathogens involved in periodontal disease, is a potent stimulator for MMP expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>).</p><p>It has been well established that patients with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes have increased prevalence and severity of periodontal disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>). Considering the crucial role of MMPs in periodontal disease, it was believed that the periodontal MMP expression was increased in patients with diabetes, leading to an increase in tissue destruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>). Indeed studies have shown that the periodontal MMP expression is higher in patients with both diabetes and periodontal disease than in those with periodontal disease alone. For example, it was reported that MMP-8 and MMP-9 expression was significantly increased in the gingival tissue of diabetic patients with chronic periodontitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>). Our recent study showed a trend of increase in MMP-1 expression in periodontal tissues across patients with neither diabetes nor periodontal disease, patients with periodontal disease alone, and patients with both diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>). In our effort to understand the mechanisms involved in diabetes-promoted MMP expression, we demonstrated that elevated glucose concentration (high glucose) augmented LPS-stimulated MMP expression in macrophages by enhancing LPS-triggered signaling and transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>). We further demonstrated that lactate, which is associated with hyperglycemia and increased in plasma and saliva of diabetic patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>), also had a synergistic effect with LPS on MMP expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>). These studies revealed a molecular mechanism potentially involved in periodontal disease in diabetic patients.</p><p>Both macrophages and gingival fibroblasts are present in periodontitis-inflamed periodontal tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>), and their interaction has been shown to increase MMP expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>). However, the underlying mechanism has not been investigated. Furthermore it is unclear whether hyperglycemia alters MMP expression regulated by the interaction between macrophages and fibroblasts. In the current study, we demonstrated that coculture of U937 human histiocytes (resident macrophages) and human gingival fibroblasts in a two-compartment transwell coculture system led to an augmentation of MMP-1 expression, and IL-6 released by fibroblasts played an essential role in the augmentation. We also demonstrated that high glucose further enhanced the augmentation of MMP-1 expression.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><p><italic>Cell Culture and Treatment with LPS</italic>&#x02014;Human monocytes were isolated as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>) from blood obtained from healthy donors.

The cells were cultured in a 5% CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) containing normal glucose (5 m<sc>m</sc>) or high glucose (25 m<sc>m</sc>), 10% fetal calf serum, 1% minimum Eagle's medium non-essential amino acid solution, and 0.6 g/100 ml HEPES either independently or in Corning Transwell plates (Sigma) that have two compartments separated by a polycarbonate membrane with 0.4-&#x003bc;m pores. Fibroblasts were grown to 80% confluence in the lower compartment, and U937 cells or human monocytes were grown (0.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml) in the upper compartment. For cell treatment, LPS from <italic>E. coli</italic> was used (Sigma). The LPS was highly purified by phenol extraction and gel filtration chromatography and was cell culture-tested. We compared the potency of this LPS with that of LPS isolated from <italic>Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans</italic>, a kind gift provided by Dr. Edward Lally, University of Pennsylvania, in the stimulation of MMP-1 secretion by U937 cells.

First strand complementary DNA (cDNA) was synthesized with the iScript&#x02122; cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad) using 20 &#x003bc;l of reaction mixture containing 0.25 &#x003bc;g of total RNA, 4 &#x003bc;l of 5&#x000d7; iScript reaction mixture, and 1 &#x003bc;l of iScript reverse transcriptase. The complete reaction was cycled for 5 min at 25 &#x000b0;C, 30 min at 42 &#x000b0;C, and 5 min at 85 &#x000b0;C using a PTC-200 DNA Engine (MJ Research, Waltham, MA). The reverse transcription reaction mixture was then diluted 1:10 with nuclease-free water and used for PCR amplification of MMP cDNA in the presence of the primers. The Beacon designer software (PREMIER Biosoft International, Palo Alto, CA) was used for primer designing. Primers for MMP-1 (5&#x02032; primer, CTGGGAAGCCATCACTTACCTTGC; 3&#x02032; primer, GTTTCTAGAGTCGCTGGGAAGCTG) were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc.

Real time PCR was run in the iCycler&#x02122; real time detection system (Bio-Rad) with a two-step method. The hot start enzyme was activated (95 &#x000b0;C for 3 min), and cDNA was then amplified for 40 cycles consisting of denaturation at 95 &#x000b0;C for 10 s and annealing/extension at 53 &#x000b0;C for 45 s. A melt curve assay was then performed (55 &#x000b0;C for 1 min and then the temperature was increased by 0.5 &#x000b0;C every 10 s) to detect the formation of primer-derived trimers and dimers. Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) (5&#x02032; primer, GAATTTGGCTACAGCAACAGGGTG; 3&#x02032; primer, TCTCTTCCTCTTGTGCTCTTGCTG) served as a control. Data were analyzed with the iCycler iQ&#x02122; software. The average starting quantity of fluorescence units was used for analysis.

Thus, we first determined whether the coculture of fibroblasts and U937 cells also stimulated MMP-1 secretion.

Indeed we found that the addition of fibroblast-conditioned medium to U937 cell culture increased MMP-1 secretion in a concentration-dependent manner (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>). Conversely we also collected U937 cell-conditioned medium and applied it to fibroblast culture. Results showed that the addition of U937 cell-conditioned medium to fibroblasts did not increase MMP-1 secretion by fibroblasts (data not shown). MMP-1 expression analysis using quantitative PCR also showed no change in the MMP-1 mRNA level in fibroblasts after incubation with U937 cell-conditioned medium (data not shown). Thus, these data strongly suggested that a soluble factor(s) derived from fibroblasts is essential to stimulate MMP-1 expression in U937 cells and hence augments MMP-1 level in the coculture.</p><p><italic>IL-6 Released by Fibroblasts Is Essential for the Augmentation of MMP-1 Expression by Fibroblast and U937 Cell Coculture</italic>&#x02014; To identify the fibroblast-derived soluble factor involved in the augmentation of MMP-1 expression by U937 cells, we analyzed the inflammatory cytokine expression by fibroblasts in the coculture using an inflammatory cytokine array. From the array analysis, we found that IL-6 was the major cytokine released by fibroblasts and up-regulated by LPS and high glucose (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). In contrast, the expression of IL-1&#x003b1;, IL-1&#x003b2;, and TNF&#x003b1; was low and not stimulated by LPS and high glucose. We also found that IL-6 secretion by the coculture of fibroblasts and U937 cells was increased when compared with that by the independent cultures of fibroblasts or U937 cells and was further increased by high glucose (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7<italic>A</italic></xref>). High glucose also increased IL-6 secretion from the coculture of human monocytes and fibroblasts (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7<italic>B</italic></xref>). Because IL-6 is known to stimulate MMP expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>), we considered fibroblast-derived IL-6 as the soluble factor essential for the augmentation of MMP-1 expression by U937 cells in the coculture system. To confirm this hypothesis, we took two experimental approaches. First, we used anti-IL-6 antibody to block the interaction between IL-6 and U937 cells cultured in high glucose-containing medium. Results (<xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">Fig. 8</xref>) showed that in the absence of LPS anti-IL-6 antibody completely abolished the augmentation of MMP-1 secretion by the coculture. In contrast, anti-TNF&#x003b1; antibody had no effect. In the presence of LPS, anti-IL-6 antibody inhibited MMP-1 secretion by 78%, whereas anti-TNF&#x003b1; antibody only exerted a 15% inhibition. Although the inhibition of MMP-1 secretion by anti-TNF&#x003b1; antibody was also statistically significant, it was significantly less than that by anti-IL-6 antibody. Second, we transfected fibroblasts with IL-6 siRNA to inhibit IL-6 expression before fibroblasts were cocultured with U937 macrophages. Results showed that the transfection of fibroblasts with IL-6 siRNA markedly inhibited IL-6 expression (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9<italic>A</italic></xref>). When transfected fibroblasts were cocultured with U937 cells in the absence or presence of LPS, the augmentation of MMP-1 secretion by the coculture was inhibited by 60&#x02013;63% (<xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Fig. 9<italic>B</italic></xref>). These results strongly indicate that IL-6 plays a major role in the augmentation of the MMP-1 level in the coculture.</p><p><table-wrap position="float" id="tbl1"><label>TABLE 1</label><caption><p><bold>The expression of major inflammatory cytokines by fibroblasts in coculture of fibroblasts and U937 macrophages treated with normal or high glucose and LPS</bold> Fibroblasts cocultured with U937 macrophages in normal or high glucose-containing medium were treated with 100 ng/ml LPS for 24 h.

In contrast, AG490, a specific inhibitor for STAT1 and STAT3 pathways, had no effect. In addition, SB203580 and Bay11-7085, the specific inhibitors for p38 MAPK and NF&#x003ba;B pathways, respectively, also failed to block MMP-1 secretion (<xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 11</xref>). These results suggest that the ERK and JNK pathways mediate IL-6-augmented MMP-1 expression. Moreover because it is known that activation of ERK and JNK pathways leads to activation of AP-1 that is known to be a key transcription factor for MMP-1 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>), we determined the AP-1 transcriptional activity in U937 cells in the coculture exposed to high glucose using both an ELISA-type transcription factor activity assay and EMSA. Results from the transcription factor activity assay showed that AP-1 activity was increased by the coculture or LPS and further increased by the combination of the coculture and LPS (<xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Fig. 12<italic>A</italic></xref>). In contrast, although LPS increased NF&#x003ba;B (p50 and p65) activity in either U937 cell culture or coculture as expected, the coculture of fibroblasts and U937 cells did not augment NF&#x003ba;B activity (<xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Fig. 12<italic>B</italic></xref>), suggesting that NF&#x003ba;B is not involved in coculture-stimulated MMP-1 secretion. Our EMSA also showed a similar increase in AP-1 activity by the coculture or LPS and a further increase by the combination of coculture and LPS (<xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Fig. 12<italic>C</italic></xref>). The specific interaction between AP-1 and AP-1 probes was determined by adding unlabeled AP-1 probes and anti-c-Jun antibody.

The addition of anti-c-Jun antibody led to a supershift of AP-1 probes (<xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Fig. 12<italic>D</italic></xref>).

Although MMP-8, which is mainly released by neutrophils, has been considered to be the major collagenase for the collagen degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>), studies have shown that MMP-1 also plays an important role in periodontal tissue destruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>). A study demonstrated that polymorphism in the promoter region of MMP-1 gene, which leads to increased MMP-1 production, is associated with severe chronic periodontitis phenotype in non-smokers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>). MMP-1 mRNA expression was found to be correlated with decreased gingival collagen in patients with periodontal disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>). Furthermore MMP-1 protein level in gingival crevicular fluid collected from patients with chronic periodontitis was found to be higher than that from periodontally healthy individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>). Thus, MMP-1 is likely to act in cooperation with MMP-8 as collagenases to degrade collagen and other matrix proteins. Our current study showed that among MMP-1, MMP-13, and MMP-2, the coculture of fibroblasts and U937 macrophages only augmented MMP-1 expression, suggesting that the gene up-regulated by the coculture is specific. Moreover the coculture did not augment TIMP-1 and TIMP-2, suggesting that the interaction between fibroblasts and U937 macrophages may tip the balance between MMPs and TIMPs to MMPs, leading to an increase in collagen degradation.</p><p>It was demonstrated that the coculture of gingival fibroblasts and human monocytes led to an increase in MMP-1 production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>). However, no study was conducted to investigate the underlying mechanism. In our current study, we demonstrated that the coculture of human gingival fibroblasts and U937 macrophages led to a marked augmentation of MMP-1 expression, which is consistent with the report by Domeij <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>), and IL-6 released by fibroblasts is essential for the augmentation of MMP-1 expression. We also demonstrated that high glucose further enhanced this augmentation. These findings revealed an interesting cross-talking between fibroblasts and U937 macrophages through IL-6 for MMP-1 up-regulation. It is likely that the total amount of IL-6 in the coculture system, which is derived from both fibroblasts and U937 cells, is sufficient to trigger a signaling that acts in concert with the signaling elicited by high glucose and LPS to up-regulate MMP-1 expression by U937 macrophages, leading to a remarkable increase in MMP-1 secretion in the coculture system. This study also suggests that in periodontitis-inflamed tissue LPS derived from bacteria stimulates IL-6 secretion, and IL-6 then acts with LPS synergistically to stimulate MMP-1 expression by macrophages. Because high glucose has a synergistic effect with LPS and IL-6, this up-regulation of MMP-1 expression is likely to be further enhanced by hyperglycemia in diabetic patients.</p><p><fig position="float" id="fig12"><label>FIGURE 12.</label><caption><p><bold>Enhanced AP-1 transcriptional activity in cocultures of U937 cells and fibroblasts in response to LPS.</bold><italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic>, U937 cells cultured independently or cocultured with fibroblasts in high glucose-containing medium were treated with or without 100 ng/ml LPS for 6 h.

This is an interesting finding. As our results showed that IL-6 plays a key role in MMP-1 up-regulation in the coculture (Figs. <xref rid="fig8" ref-type="fig">8</xref> and <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">9</xref>), this finding would suggest that IL-6 released by the coculture stimulates MMP-1 expression by U937 cells but not fibroblasts. Actually this notion is consistent with the report by Irwin <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>) showing that the addition of IL-6 up to the concentration of 1,000 ng/ml to gingival fibroblasts had no effect on MMP-1 expression unless the soluble IL-6 receptor was used. It is most likely that lack of soluble IL-6 receptor in our coculture system is the reason that no MMP-1 up-regulation in fibroblasts was observed. In contrast to fibroblasts, IL-6 effectively stimulated U937 macrophages without soluble IL-6 receptor (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10<italic>A</italic></xref>). Interestingly our results showed that IL-6 was more potent than LPS at the concentrations of 1 and 10 ng/ml in the stimulation of MMP-1 secretion by U937 macrophages (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10<italic>A</italic></xref>), indicating that IL-6 is a major player in MMP-1 up-regulation. In our recent investigation on the expression of IL-6, TNF&#x003b1;, IL-1&#x003b2;, MMP-1, and MMP-8 in periodontal tissue, we observed a trend of increase in IL-6 mRNA expression across patients with neither diabetes nor periodontal disease, patients with periodontal disease alone, and patients with both diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>). Fascinatingly the same study also demonstrated a trend of increase in MMP-1 expression. Considering the potent stimulatory effect of IL-6 on MMP-1 expression, it is possible that IL-6 released by fibroblasts in periodontitis-inflamed tissue in response to LPS stimulated MMP-1 expression.</p><p>LPS is known to be a potent stimulator for MMP expression by macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>). Besides MMPs, LPS also stimulates the expression of inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6. Given the fact that IL-6 is also a powerful stimulator for MMP-1 expression, it is likely that LPS up-regulates MMP-1 expression via both IL-6-dependent and -independent pathways. Moreover our study showed that LPS and IL-6 had a synergistic effect on MMP-1 expression by U937 macrophages (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10<italic>B</italic></xref>). Therefore, IL-6 appears to act as an &#x0201c;enhancer&#x0201d; for LPS in the stimulation of MMP-1 expression. Because both LPS and IL-6 stimulate gene expression via MAPK signaling pathways and AP-1 transcription factor, it is possible that LPS and IL-6 have a synergistic effect on MAPK signaling and AP-1 activity, leading to an enhanced stimulation of MMP-1 expression. Further studies are necessary to investigate the coordination of signaling and transcriptional activation between LPS and IL-6 on MMP-1 expression.</p><p>Another interesting finding from our current study is that high glucose and IL-6 had a synergistic effect on MMP-1 expression by U937 macrophages (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10, <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic></xref>). In addition to IL-6, our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>) and the current data (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10<italic>B</italic></xref>) showed that high glucose also has a synergistic effect with LPS on MMP-1 expression. Thus, we expect that high glucose would augment the stimulatory effect of the combination of LPS and IL-6 on MMP-1 expression. Indeed our results showed that after U937 macrophages were pre-exposed to high glucose the treatment with IL-6 and LPS led to a 2.5-fold increase in MMP-1 secretion as compared with those preexposed to normal glucose (<xref rid="fig10" ref-type="fig">Fig. 10<italic>B</italic></xref>). Considering that LPS and IL-6 play a critical role in periodontal disease, these findings indicate that diabetic patients with poor glycemic control may have a significant increase in periodontal MMP-1 expression and subsequent tissue destruction as compared with nondiabetic patients during the progression of periodontal disease.</p><p>It is known that STAT3 and MAPK pathways are the major cascades mediating IL-6-stimulated gene expression by macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>). In our experiments to determine which pathway is responsible for the coculture-augmented MMP-1 expression, we found that inhibitors for ERK and JNK pathways, but not the STAT3 cascade, blocked MMP-1 expression augmented by conditioned medium from fibroblasts (<xref rid="fig11" ref-type="fig">Fig. 11</xref>), suggesting that ERK and JNK pathways, but not the STAT3 cascade, are involved in the MMP-1 up-regulation by cross-talking between fibroblasts and U937 macrophages. This finding is different from the previous reports that both STAT3 and MAPK pathways were involved in IL-6-stimulated MMP-1 expression in bovine chondrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>) and mouse skin epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>). It is possible that the cells from different species and different tissues may have different signaling control mechanisms in regulating MMP-1 expression: ERK and JNK MAPK pathways are sufficient in mediating MMP-1 expression for human macrophages, whereas both STAT3 and MAPK pathways are required for bovine chondrocytes and mouse skin epithelial cells. In the investigation of which transcription factor was involved in the coculture-stimulated MMP-1 expression, our study demonstrated that the activity of transcription factor AP-1, which is known to be activated as a result of ERK and JNK MAPK activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>), was stimulated by the coculture and further enhanced by LPS (<xref rid="fig12" ref-type="fig">Fig. 12, <italic>A</italic> and <italic>C</italic></xref>). Considering that AP-1 transcription factor is critical for MMP-1 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref35">35</xref>), our results indicate that IL-6 stimulates MMP-1 expression through ERK and JNK pathways and subsequent AP-1 transcriptional activation. Because high glucose enhances AP-1 activity as shown by our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>), it is likely that high glucose augments IL-6-stimulated MMP-1 expression via AP-1 activation.</p><p>IL-6 has been well documented as a key inflammatory cytokine involved in several inflammation-associated diseases such as coronary artery disease, diabetes, and rheumatoid arthritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>). In this study, we demonstrated that IL-6 mediated the up-regulation of MMP-1 expression by the coculture of fibroblasts and U937 macrophages exposed to high glucose. Thus, this study strongly suggests that IL-6 is a key player in diabetes-associated periodontal disease and should be considered as a major target for the treatment of periodontal disease.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><citation citation-type="journal">Socransky, S.
