Although direct recognition of IE by NK cells induce functional responses such as CXCL8 production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000228-Baratin1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, we have shown that NK cell IFN-&#x003b3; production in response to IE was highly dependent on the cooperation with monocytes/macrophages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000228-Baratin1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Similar results, involving myeloid accessory cells, have been recently reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000228-Newman1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Myeloid cell-derived interleukin (IL)-18 and IL-12 were shown to be mandatory for NK cell IFN-&#x003b3; response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000228-Baratin1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000228-Newman1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000228-Walther1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. However, the innate receptors engaged in the interactions between IE, NK cells and macrophages remain to be identified. Toll like receptor (TLR) 2 was reported to recognize glycosylphosphatidyl inositol (GPI) anchors of <italic>Pf</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000228-Krishnegowda1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, but our previous studies ruled out a requirement for this molecule in NK cell activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000228-Baratin1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p><italic>Pf</italic> infection results in the exposure at the red blood cell (RBC) surface of multiple molecules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000228-Marti1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref> that could be candidate ligands involved in NK cell activation. Among them, PfEMP1 molecules, belong to a large family of parasite proteins that have been extensively characterized for their capacity to mediate IE cytoadhesion to the vascular endothelium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000228-Kraemer1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. This adhesion process, often described as a way for the parasite to evade splenic clearance, has also been reported as associated to vascular obstruction of vital organs leading to major pathological events. PfEMP1 proteins are encoded by &#x0223c;60 different <italic>var</italic> genes, but deletions, recombinations and gene conversions create a virtually unlimited repertoire <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000228-FreitasJunior1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. <italic>var</italic> gene expression is mutually exclusive such that only a single copy is transcribed in one parasite at any one time <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000228-Chen1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Binding experiments using recombinant PfEMP1 domains have shown an interaction with several host receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000228-Flick1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Three of them, CD36, ICAM-1 and chondroitin sulfate A (CSA) have been extensively studied. ICAM-1 is expressed on hematopoietic cells and interacts with the &#x003b2;2 integrins CD11a/CD18 (LFA-1), CD11b/CD18 (Mac-1) or CD11c/CD18, which are involved in cell adhesion and activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000228-Hogg1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. ICAM-1 is also a co-stimulatory receptor that promotes T cell activation and initiates intracellular signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000228-Hubbard1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. CSA is a sulfated glycosaminoglycan chain with a vast structural diversity that decorates several cell surface molecules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000228-Sugahara1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. CSA has been involved in pregnancy-associated malaria, a severe form of the disease due to massive sequestration of the parasite in the placenta. Along this line, most <italic>Pf</italic> strains isolated from women suffering of pregnancy-associated malaria cytoadhere to CSA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000228-Fried1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Finally, CD36 is a broadly expressed class B scavenger receptor which supports adherence of most <italic>Pf</italic> natural isolates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000228-Ockenhouse1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. CD36 has been involved in the non opsonic phagocytosis of IE by macrophages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000228-McGilvray1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, and in the modulation of monocyte-derived dendritic cells function by IE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000228-Urban2">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. Mouse CD36 is also a co-receptor for TLR2 and may thus act as an activating molecule <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000228-Hoebe1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. Altogether these data prompted us to investigate the role of PfEMP1, CSA, CD36 and ICAM-1 in the direct and indirect detection of IE by NK cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec id="s2a"><title>CSA is involved in the cytoadhesion of IE to NK cell lines but is dispensable for primary NK cell activation</title><p>Physical interactions between NK cells and IE have been described upon co-culture <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000228-Baratin1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000228-ArtavanisTsakonas2">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. Since PfEMP1 is responsible for cytoadhesion of IE to endothelial cells, we hypothesized that this cell surface parasite protein might also play a role in IE detection by NK cells. Flow cytometry analysis revealed that circulating NK cells expressed three major receptors for PfEMP1: CSA, CD36 and ICAM-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000228-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). The human NK cell lines, NK92 and NKL, also expressed CSA and ICAM-1 but not CD36 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000228-g001">Fig. 1</xref>).</p><p>We first evaluated the involvement of CSA in the direct detection of IE by NK cells, using the FCR3-CSA parasite strain that has been selected by panning to adhere to CSA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000228-Pouvelle1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. Upon co-culture, FCR3-CSA-infected RBC rapidly adhered to NK92 cells forming structures reminiscent of rosettes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000228-g002">Fig. 2A, left panel</xref>). Rosettes were defined as conjugates engaging one NK cell bound to at least two IE. This striking phenotype was specific of parasitized RBC because uninfected RBC did not form rosettes with NK cells. Quantification revealed that after 1 h of co-culture 26.7&#x00025;&#x000b1;4 NK92 cells formed rosettes with FCR3-CSA-infected RBC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000228-g002">Fig. 2A, right panel</xref>). This interaction was totally abrogated when NK92 cells were pre-treated with chondroitinase ABC that degrades CSA or when an excess of soluble CSA was added in the co-culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000228-g002">Fig. 2A, right panel</xref>). Adding soluble CSA on preformed rosettes disrupted these structures and similar results were obtained with NKL cells (data not shown). To definitively demonstrate the role of CSA in the formation of rosettes between NK cells and IE, we used the 2A5 strain, a FCR3 mutant in which the <italic>var2csa</italic> gene is disrupted <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000228-Viebig1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. This PfEMP1- encoding gene was shown to be essential for the binding to CSA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000228-Viebig1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. RBC infected by 2A5 were unable to form rosettes with NK92 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000228-g002">Fig. 2A, right panel</xref>). Thus PfEMP1 that binds CSA acts as a dominant molecule in the cytoadhesion of IE to human NK cell lines.</p><p>No stable rosettes between primary resting NK cells and CSA-binding IE were detected. Since the CSA sugar chain length and sulfate content is critical for the binding of PfEMP1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000228-Chai1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, it is possible that peripheral NK cells do not express the appropriate CSA structure. However subsets of NK cells, such as activated NK cells or uterine NK cells which accumulate in the placenta during pregnancy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000228-Hanna1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000228-Koopman1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, might express the CSA features required for rosette formation.</p><p>Although IE did not form rosette with primary resting NK cells, we observed conjugates that involved one NK cell bound to one IE. Consistent with previous data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000228-ArtavanisTsakonas2">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, these cellular contacts were visualized with several different <italic>Pf</italic> strains including CSA-adhesive strains (data not shown). We thus investigated whether CSA was involved in the activation of primary NK cells. After 24 hours co-incubation of PBMC with FCR3-CSA-infected RBC, NK cells up-regulated CD69, CD25 at their surface and produced IFN-&#x003b3; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000228-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). Importantly, NK cells were also responsive to RBC infected with the 2A5 strain that is deficient for the binding to CSA. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000228-g002">Figure 2B</xref>, IFN-&#x003b3; production by NK cells following PBMC stimulation with 2A5-infected RBC was very similar to the one induce by the parental strain even though CD69 and CD25 up-regulation was significantly lower (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000228-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). These data suggest that although the interaction between CSA and PfEMP1 might contribute to NK cell activation, it was not mandatory.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>NK cells deficient in CD36 expression are reactive to IE</title><p>We next explored the role of CD36 in NK cell activation by IE. We took advantage of the existence of CD36 genetic deficiencies in the human population <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000228-Lee1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. PBMC were isolated from a CD36-deficient patient and the absence of CD36 was confirmed by immunoblot analysis as well as by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000228-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). The 3D7 parasite was chosen in the following settings, because it is an oligoclonal laboratory strain that is not selected for any adhesive phenotype, and it is one of the most potent <italic>Pf</italic> strain for NK cell activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000228-Baratin1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Remarkably, CD36-deficient NK cells within PBMC were as reactive as normal NK cells to 3D7-infected RBC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000228-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). Therefore PfEMP1:CD36 interaction was dispensable for NK cell activation by IE. Since the patient included in our study did not express CD36 on any PBMC, our data also showed that CD36 was neither required for the direct sensing of IE by NK cells nor for the suitable activation of macrophages, their obligatory partners.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>NK cell IFN-&#x003b3; production requires engagement of ICAM-1 with LFA-1, but not with PfEMP1</title><p>We next addressed the role of ICAM-1, a third major PfEMP1 receptor, in NK cell activation by IE. We first assessed the NK cell response to IE, in the presence or absence of the blocking monoclonal antibody (mAb) 15.2 directed against ICAM-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000228-Berendt1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000228-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). Addition of the mAb 15.2 to the co-culture drastically impaired IFN-&#x003b3; production by NK cells and significantly reduced the CD69 up-regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000228-g004">Fig. 4B, right and left panels</xref>). In contrast CD25 up-regulation remained unchanged in the presence of the mAb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000228-g004">Fig. 4B, middle panel</xref>). An isotype control mAb directed against the NK cell surface receptor, NKG2D, did not alter the NK cell response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000228-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). Thus ICAM-1 engagement is critical for NK cell IFN-&#x003b3; production and participates to CD69 up-regulation. However CD25 up-regulation is independent of ICAM-1, indicating that NK cell activation by IE involve at least two different pathways.</p><p>ICAM-1 consists of five Ig-like domains (D1 to D5) a short transmembrane region and a small carboxyl terminal cytoplasmic domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000228-Staunton1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000228-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). The PfEMP1 and LFA-1 binding sites overlap and are located into the D1 domain of ICAM-1 whereas its two other host ligands, CD11c/CD18 and Mac-1 bind respectively to domains D4 and D3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000228-Diamond1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000228-Frick1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. The mAb 15.2 inhibits both the PfEMP1:ICAM-1 and the LFA-1:ICAM-1 interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000228-Berendt1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000228-Staunton2">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, to independently address the role of LFA-1 and PfEMP1 in NK cell response to IE, we used two other anti-ICAM-1 blocking mAb directed against distinct epitopes. The mAb RR1/1 only blocks the LFA-1:ICAM-1 interaction and the mAb My13 only inhibits the binding of ICAM-1 to PfEMP1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000228-Berendt1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000228-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>). The addition of RR1/1 to the co-culture mimicked the effect of 15.2, showing a mandatory role of the interaction between ICAM-1 and LFA-1 in NK cell IFN-&#x003b3; response to IE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000228-g004">Fig. 4B, right panel</xref>). Of note, IE and non infected erythrocytes do not express ICAM-1 or LFA-1 (data not shown), excluding a role of these two molecules at the surface of RBC. We next confirmed the importance of the interaction between ICAM-1 and its host ligand LFA-1 by showing that TS1/18, a blocking mAb directed against the &#x003b2;2 subunit (CD18) of LFA-1, inhibited NK cell IFN-&#x003b3; production and reduced CD69 up-regulation in the same way than 15.2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000228-g004">Fig. 4B, right and left panels</xref>). In contrast, the anti-ICAM-1 blocking mAb, My13, had no impact on NK cell response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000228-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>), ruling out a major role of an interaction between PfEMP1 and ICAM-1. Although the cell surface expression of CD69 is increased on purified NK cells in the presence of IE, the extent of this up-regulation is lower than when NK cells are included in PBMC, i.e., when they cooperate with macrophages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000228-Baratin1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. The inhibition of CD69 up-regulation by anti-ICAM-1 mAb is thus consistent with the role of ICAM-1:LFA-1 interaction in the helper function of macrophages to NK cell activation induced by IE. Therefore, an ICAM-1:LFA-1-dependent pathway promotes both CD69 up-regulation and IFN-&#x003b3; secretion by NK cells in the presence of IE. As macrophages and NK cells express both ICAM-1 and LFA-1, it is possible that bidirectional interactions involving these molecules are required for optimal NK cell response. In contrast, the NK cell CD25 up-regulation induced by IE is independent of ICAM-1:LFA-1 interactions.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>PfEMP1 deficient parasites are efficient activators of NK cells</title><p>Our results showed that neither CSA, nor CD36, nor ICAM-1 was required as PfEMP1 receptor for NK cell activation. However, due to the high diversity of the <italic>var</italic> genes, we could not exclude a role of any other PfEMP1 molecule in NK cell activation by IE. To address this issue, we used a mutant parasite strain deficient for PfEMP1 expression; DC-J is a transgenic parasite selected to express a <italic>var</italic> gene in which the PfEMP1 coding region has been replaced by a drug selectable marker leading to the silencing of all other <italic>var</italic> genes in the <italic>Pf</italic> genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000228-Dzikowski1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>.

Remarkably, NK cells were still responsive to DC-J-infected RBC as they up-regulated CD69 and CD25, and produced IFN-&#x003b3; upon co-culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0000228-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). Altogether these results ruled out a mandatory role for any PfEMP1 molecules in NK cell activation and indicated also that knobs were not essential structures for NK cell response to IE.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Concluding remarks</title><p>The prediction of the host response to microbes necessitates the precise dissection of innate recognition mechanisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000228-Beutler1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000228-Hargreaves1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. We identified here two receptor:ligand pairs involved in two uncoupled events occurring during the sensing of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> infection by NK cells; PfEMP1:CSA interaction mediates cytoadhesion of IE with NK cells and ICAM-1:LFA-1 interactions play a major role in the cellular cooperation required for NK cell IFN-&#x003b3; response. In addition to these two modes of IE sensing, our data revealed a third pathway that leads to CD25 up-regulation in a PfEMP1 and ICAM-1 independent pathway.</p><p>These different components of the NK cell response may lead to differential outcomes in the physiopathology of malaria. Indeed, massive sequestration of CSA-binding parasites in the placenta leads to severe clinical malaria in primigravid women <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000228-Fried1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. CSA-binding IE are rarely observed outside of pregnancy and primigravid women generally lack acquired immunity to these parasites, suggesting that CSA-binding IE are rapidly eliminated from the host <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000228-Ricke1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. As NK cells traffic through the spleen, conjugate formation with CSA-binding IE, might contribute to parasite splenic destruction. On the other hand, during the first part of normal pregnancy, NK cells invade the decidua <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000228-MoffettKing1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>, so that they might be used by the parasite as selective uterine carriers. It is thus tempting to speculate that the potential rosetting of IE with activated NK cells through PfEMP1:CSA interaction may serve as a <italic>Pf</italic> dissemination strategy. This hypothesis that would reveal a selective advantage of <italic>Pf</italic><italic>var2csa</italic> gene upon pregnancy remains to be tested by the detection of NK-IE rosettes in spleen and/or in placenta sections obtained from <italic>Pf</italic>-infected individuals.</p><p>The second pathway described here relies on the engagement of ICAM-1 with LFA-1 but not with the parasite protein PfEMP1. This essential interaction that is reminiscent of the obligate cross-talk between NK cells and myeloid accessory cells revealed that in addition to soluble factors these two partners cooperate through cellular contacts. Interestingly, an ICAM-1 allelic variant termed ICAM-1<sup>kilifi</sup> has been identified in malaria endemic area. This polymorphism is highly frequent in sub-saharian Africa, but is not found in Caucasian populations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000228-Chakravorty1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. While some genetic analyses have associated ICAM-1<sup>kilifi</sup> to cerebral malaria susceptibility, other studies suggested a protective role of this mutation or did not support any correlation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000228-Chakravorty1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. ICAM-1<sup>Kilifi</sup> was not only shown to alter the interaction with some Pf strains in adhesion assays but also to exhibit a reduced avidity for LFA-1 as compared to the commonly expressed ICAM-1 allele <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000228-Craig1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. Our data suggest that the role of ICAM-1 polymorphism should thus be revisited in light of its potential implication during the early NK cell response to Pf infection. Along this line, the interplay between the effect of ICAM-1<sup>Kilifi</sup> on innate immune response and, on parasite sequestration may help to explain the apparently conflicting reports on the association of ICAM-1<sup>kilifi</sup> with severe malaria.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s3"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Parasites</title><p><italic>Pf</italic> were cultured as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0000228-Baratin1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref> and were routinely proven to be mycoplasma-free by PCR (kit from Minerva Biolabs).
