However, Ryk's correlation with Wnt/Frizzled (Fz) signaling is poorly understood. Here, we report that Ryk regulates <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> convergent extension (CE) movements via the &#x003b2;-arrestin 2 (&#x003b2;arr2)-dependent endocytic process triggered by noncanonical Wnt signaling. During <italic>X. laevis</italic> gastrulation, &#x003b2;arr2-mediated endocytosis of Fz7 and dishevelled (Dvl/Dsh) actually occurs in the dorsal marginal zone tissues, which actively participate in noncanonical Wnt signaling. Noncanonical Wnt11/Fz7-mediated endocytosis of Dsh requires the cell-membrane protein Ryk. Ryk interacts with both Wnt11 and &#x003b2;arr2, cooperates with Fz7 to mediate Wnt11-stimulated endocytosis of Dsh, and signals the noncanonical Wnt pathway in CE movements. Conversely, depletion of Ryk and Wnt11 prevents Dsh endocytosis in dorsal marginal zone tissues. Our study suggests that Ryk functions as an essential regulator for noncanonical Wnt/Fz-mediated endocytosis in the regulation of <italic>X. laevis</italic> CE movements.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used in this paper: &#x003b2;arr2, &#x003b2;-arrestin 2; Cav, caveolin; CE, convergent extension; Co, control; DMZ, dorsal marginal zone; Dsh, dishevelled; Fz, Frizzled; JNK, Jun N-terminal kinase; MO, morpholino oligonucleotide; ORF, open reading frame; PCP, planar cell polarity; Ryk, atypical receptor related tyrosine kinase; XRyk, <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> Ryk.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Morphogenetic movements in gastrulation are essential for establishing basic germ layers and the body axis during early vertebrate development. The major driving forces for this process include convergent extension (CE) movements, by which cells polarize and elongate along the mediolateral axis and intercalate toward the midline (convergence), leading to extension of the anterior/posterior axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Wallingford et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Veeman et al., 2003</xref>). Although the precise molecular mechanisms of CE movements are not clearly understood, the noncanonical Wnt pathway is known to be important in the control of CE movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Myers et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Wallingford and Habas, 2005</xref>).</p><p>The noncanonical Wnt pathway, which is mediated by interaction between Frizzled (Fz) and members of the Wnt family of secreted glycoproteins, regulates cell shape, cell polarity, and cell adhesion without the induction of a secondary axis. This pathway is subdivided into the Wnt&#x02013;Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> pathway and the Wnt&#x02013;planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Veeman et al., 2003</xref>). The former acts via a trimeric G protein to stimulate intracellular calcium release and activate PKC&#x003b1; and Cdc42 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Kohn and Moon, 2005</xref>).

However, the molecular mechanism by which the endocytic process in noncanonical Wnt signaling is regulated or the physiological and functional importance of this process during embryonic development remains unclear. In the present study, we provide new insight that atypical receptor related tyrosine kinase (Ryk) acts as an Fz coreceptor and regulates the noncanonical Wnt-mediated endocytosis in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> CE movements.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and discussion</title><p>In <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> and mammals, Fz and Dsh have been detected in the cytoplasmic puncta, which overlap with elements of the endocytic machinery within Wnt/Wg-responsive cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Chen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Rives et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Seto and Bellen, 2006</xref>). Association of Dsh with the &#x003bc;-adaptin of AP2 has been needed for Fz4 internalization in culture cells and normal gastrulation in <italic>X. laevis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Yu et al., 2007</xref>). In a recent study, we demonstrated that &#x003b2;arr2, which acts as an essential adaptor in clathrin-mediated endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Claing et al., 2002</xref>), has a pivotal role in regulating <italic>X. laevis</italic> CE movements and requires endocytic activity for its function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Kim and Han, 2007</xref>). To further strengthen the claim that endocytic control in noncanonical Wnt signaling occurs in dorsal marginal zone (DMZ) tissues undergoing CE movements, we examined whether endocytosis of Dsh and the noncanonical Wnt/Fz, Wnt11, and Fz7, appears in <italic>X. laevis</italic> CE movements at the cellular level. Indeed, Dsh localized to punctate structures that colocalized with the cellular endocytic elements, Rab5 (an early endosomal marker; Fig. S1 A, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200710188/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200710188/DC1</ext-link>), and endogenous &#x003b2;2 adaptin (a subunit of the heterotetrameric AP2 adaptor complex that indicates the formation of endocytic clathrin-coated vesicles; <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>), in DMZ tissues during gastrulation. Wnt11 and Fz7 also colocalized with Rab5 (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, B and C</xref>). Interestingly, we found that knockdown of &#x003b2;arr2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Kim and Han, 2007</xref>), which mediates Fz internalization in Wnt-stimulated cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Chen et al., 2003</xref>), by the morpholino (x&#x003b2;arr2 morpholino oligonucleotide [MO]) and the endocytic mutant (x&#x003b2;arr2-KRK/Q) relocalizes Dsh to the cell membrane and inhibits colocalization with &#x003b2;2 adaptin in the cytoplasm of DMZ cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1, D and E</xref>). Likewise, &#x003b2;arr2 MO blocked the overlap between Fz7 and Rab5 (Fig. S1 B). A recent study showed that members of caveolin (Cav) family, Cav-1 and -2, which mediate clathrin-independent endocytosis, are expressed in entire regions of gastrula stages, including the involuting mesoderm during <italic>X. laevis</italic> early embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Razani et al., 2002</xref>). We observed that Dsh does not colocalize with Cav-1 and -2 in DMZ cells (Fig. S1, C&#x02013;E), which indicates that Dsh endocytosis is not involved in the caveolar pathway. Together, these results strongly support the idea that in <italic>X. laevis</italic> CE movements, internalization of Fz7 and Dsh is mediated by &#x003b2;arr2- and clathrin/AP2-dependent processes.</p><fig position="float" id="fig1"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Endocytosis of Fz7 and Dsh occurs in <italic>X. laevis</italic> CE movements.</bold> Embryos were microinjected into the two dorsal blastomeres at the four-cell stage with a combination of the indicated mRNAs (500 pg GFP Dsh, 500 pg myc Fz7, 500 pg YFP Wnt11, 500 pg myc Rab5, 500 pg GFP Rab5, 1 ng x&#x003b2;arr2-KRK/Q, 10 ng x&#x003b2;arr2 MO, and 10 ng Co MO).

(D and E) Functional knockdown of &#x003b2;arr2 by x&#x003b2;arr2 MO and x&#x003b2;arr2-KRK/Q relocalized Dsh to the cell membrane and inhibited colocalization with &#x003b2;2 adaptin in cytoplasm.

Considering these data, the finding of the endocytosis of Fz7 and Dsh in CE movements prompted us to determine whether Fz7 and Dsh are internalized and present in endocytic vesicles as a result of noncanonical Wnt11 stimulation. The normal punctate localization of Dsh did not colocalize with these endocytic markers in <italic>X. laevis</italic> animal cap cells where both the CE and noncanonical Wnt signaling do not occur (Fig. S2, A and B, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200710188/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200710188/DC1</ext-link>), as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Schwarz-Romond et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Kim and Han, 2007</xref>). When GFP Dsh was expressed with Fz7 in animal cap cells, Dsh showed continuous staining at the cell membrane and did not colocalize with Rab5 (Fig. S2 C). Intriguingly, expression together with Wnt11, like zebrafish cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Witzel et al., 2006</xref>), led to the coalescence of Dsh into puncta at the cell membrane that colocalized with Fz7 (Fig. S2 D) but not Rab5 and &#x003b2;2 adaptin (Fig. S2, E and F). Moreover, although &#x003b2;arr2 was present, the Wnt11-induced Fz7 aggregates (Fig. S2 G) were not internalized and were found only in punctate structures overlapping with &#x003b2;arr2 at the cell membrane (Fig. S2 H). We conclude that Dsh and &#x003b2;arr2 are recruited to the Wnt11-Fz7 calescence formed by the activation of noncanonical Wnt signaling and that the noncanonical Fz/Dsh endocytosis in <italic>X. laevis</italic> cells requires some additional component beyond Wnt stimulation.</p><p>Recent advances in the signal transduction field have led to the claim that cell-membrane proteins serving as coreceptors have a role in promoting productive signal transduction via the interaction with receptor-mediated endocytosis. Low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5/6 and Fz act as Wnt coreceptors and are essential for canonical Wnt signaling and Fz-mediated endocytosis in flies and mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Kikuchi and Yamamoto, 2007</xref>). Likewise, ADAM12, which acts through an association with TGF-&#x003b2; type II receptor (T&#x003b2;RII), mediates TGF&#x003b2; signaling by controlling the endocytic trafficking of the TGF&#x003b2; receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Atfi et al., 2007</xref>). Recently, it was found that Ryk, known as a homologue of Derailed in the fly and Lin-18 in the worm, is a plasma membrane protein that has important functions in Wnt signaling in several contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Keeble and Cooper, 2006</xref>). Ryk contains a PDZ-binding domain and a protein tyrosine kinase domain lacking kinase activity and has an extracellular Wnt inhibitory factor (WIF) domain that allows Ryk to interact with Wnt and act as its receptor. In fact, Ryk's WIF domain binds to Wnt1/3/3a/5a and forms a ternary complex with Fz8 and Wnt1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Keeble and Cooper, 2006</xref>). However, the precise molecular mechanism by which Ryk correlates with Wnt/Fz signaling is poorly understood. To study the possibility that Ryk acts as a Fz coreceptor and cooperates with Fz7 to promote noncanonical Wnt11-mediated endocytosis, we first isolated a full-length cDNA of <italic>X. laevis</italic> Ryk (XRyk), which is highly similar to orthologues from other species (human, 87% identity; mouse, 88% identity), from DMZ tissues of gastrula using a PCR-based approach (GenBank accession no. <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AAH74417">AAH74417</ext-link>). Temporally, Ryk is expressed both maternally and zygotically throughout the early development of <italic>X. laevis</italic> (Fig. S3 A, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200710188/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200710188/DC1</ext-link>). Spatially, Ryk is visible in the DMZ tissues of the embryo during the gastrula stages (Fig. S3 B). At later stages, Ryk expression was localized in the head region, including the eye, the otic vesicle, and the branchial arch (Fig. S3 C). We then tested whether, in the presence of Ryk, the Wnt11-induced accumulation of Fz7 and Dsh colocalizes with Rab5. To our surprise and contrary to the expression of Wnt11 alone, the punctate aggregates of Dsh and Fz7 (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>) overlapped with Rab5 in animal cap cells that coexpressed Wnt11 and Ryk (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, B and C</xref>). Fz7 also colocalized with Ryk in cytoplasmic puncta (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D</xref>, yellow arrows) as well as in membrane (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D</xref>, white arrows). However, when Fz7 or Wnt11 was excluded, Ryk could not promote the cytoplasmic vesicles of Dsh (unpublished data). In addition, Ryk, like Fz7, interacted with the noncanonical Wnt11 and Wnt5a (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 E</xref>). Furthermore, Ryk also bound to Dsh via its own cytoplasmic domain (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 F</xref>), as described previously for mammalian Ryk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Lu et al., 2004</xref>). These results strongly suggest that Ryk is required for noncanonical Wnt11/Fz7-simulated internalization of Dsh and forms an endocytic complex with these components.</p><fig position="float" id="fig2"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Ryk promotes internalization of the Wnt11-induced Fz7 and Dsh aggregates in animal cap cells.</bold> (A&#x02013;D) Four-cell stage embryos were injected in the animal pole with various mRNAs in combination as indicated (500 pg GFP Dsh, 500 pg myc Rab5, 1 ng Fz7, 1 ng myc Fz7, 1 ng CFP Fz7, 1 ng YFP Fz7, 500 pg GFP Rab5, 1 ng XRyk, 1 ng myc XRyk, and 1 ng Wnt11).

The XRyk MO effectively blocked translation of mRNA containing the 5&#x02032; untranslated region sequences complementary to its MO, but translation of mRNA containing only the open reading frame (ORF) of the protein was not affected. Control (Co) MO had no effect on translation of the Ryk protein, and neither XRyk MO nor Co MO inhibited translation of the control, actin (Fig. S3 D). Interestingly, depletion of Ryk in <italic>X. laevis</italic> resulted in CE movement-defective phenotypes (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 C</xref>), which included the delay of blastopore closure and the failure of neural tube closure and anterior/posterior axis formation in whole embryos, as well as the significant inhibition of the elongation of Keller (DMZ) sandwich explants (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 G</xref>). Additionally, XRyk overexpression induced defects of CE movements that were indistinguishable from those of the XRyk knockdown (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, B and F</xref>). To verify the specificity of the XRyk knockdown in CE movements, we performed a rescue assay with the ORF XRyk construct. Coinjection of XRyk MO with ORF XRyk mRNA rescued the CE defects caused by XRyk MO (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, D and H</xref>; and Fig. S3, E and F).</p><fig position="float" id="fig3"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>Ryk is essential for CE movements.</bold> (A&#x02013;H) Overexpression or depletion of XRyk caused the disruption of CE movements.

To examine whether the phenotypes resulting from XRyk MO were caused by a defect in mesodermal differentiation, we performed whole-mount in situ hybridization using several mesodermal genes. Before the onset of CE movements, XRyk MO-injected embryos (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, I&#x02032; and K&#x02032;</xref>) exhibited normal expression of the dorsal mesodermal marker <italic>Chordin</italic> and the panmesodermal marker <italic>Xbra</italic> (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, I and K</xref>).

However, <italic>Chordin</italic> and <italic>Xbra</italic> expression levels remained the same. Localization of MyoD in XRyk MO or Co MO-injected embryos at later stages also showed that muscle differentiation was not affected by XRyk depletion (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, M and N</xref>). In addition, RT-PCR analysis demonstrated that XRyk does not affect the endogenous expression of dorsal mesoderm genes nor induce expression of these genes regulated by FGF, activin, and Wnt&#x02013;&#x003b2;-catenin signaling (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 O</xref>). Next, we determined the effect of XRyk MO on the normal internalization of Dsh in CE movements. Fluorescence analysis showed that the XRyk MO relocalized Dsh to the cell membrane and inhibited colocalization with Rab5 in the cytoplasm of DMZ cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 Q</xref>). Moreover, depletion of Wnt11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Pandur et al., 2002</xref>) blocked the colocalization between Dsh and Rab5 (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 R</xref>), which indicates that Dsh endocytosis is dependent on endogenous Wnt11 signal in CE movements. Together, these results support the idea that Ryk is required for proper CE movements and normal endocytic regulation of noncanonical Wnt signaling without affecting cell fate during <italic>X. laevis</italic> gastrulation.</p><p>Next, we wanted to know whether Ryk signals the noncanonical Wnt pathway during CE movements. In the PCP pathway, phosphorylation of Dsh is important for its translocation to the cell membrane, and this translocation is a prerequisite for functional signaling activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Park et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Kim and Han, 2007</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that Ryk regulates the phosphorylation and subcellular localization of Dsh. In considering this possibility, we observed that Ryk induces the hyperphosphorylation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 A</xref>) and membrane accumulation of Dsh in animal cap cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, B and C</xref>). In addition, we measured the activity of RhoA by using a GST-RBD fusion protein that recognizes the GTP-bound active RhoA and the phosphorylation level of JNK in CE movements. With theses assays, we found that XRyk is required for RhoA activation (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 F</xref>) in concert with its translocation to the cell membrane of animal cap tissues (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, D and E</xref>) and increases JNK phosphorylation in DMZ cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 G</xref>). We then proceeded to determine the relationship between Ryk and &#x003b2;arr2. Coimmunoprecipitation and fluorescence analyses showed that Ryk is capable of binding to &#x003b2;arr2 (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 H</xref>) and can redistribute &#x003b2;arr2 from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane in animal cap cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, I and J</xref>). Importantly, in the presence of Xdsh MA, a construct fused with the mitochondrial membrane&#x02013;anchoring sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Park et al., 2005</xref>), the Ryk-dependent membrane accumulation of &#x003b2;arr2 is relocalized to intracellular clusters (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 K</xref>), which implies that Ryk, like Fz, indirectly interacts with &#x003b2;arr2 via Dsh. Furthermore, we found that &#x003b2;arr2 knockdown inhibits the noncanonical Wnt11/Fz7-mediated Dsh endocytosis in the presence of Ryk (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, L and M</xref>). Therefore, our observations strongly suggest that Ryk acts as a novel regulator that is essential for noncanonical Wnt/Fz-mediated endocytosis in the regulation of <italic>X. laevis</italic> CE movements. This idea was supported by investigating the biological epistasis between Ryk and noncanonical Wnt signaling components in more detail. For this purpose, rescue experiments using a DMZ elongation assay were performed. Wnt11 overexpression inhibited the elongation of DMZ explants, and, intriguingly, this inhibition was rescued by the coexpression of XRyk MO. Moreover, the CE movements that were significantly inhibited by Ryk overexpression were restored by the functional inhibition of cytoplasmic downstream molecules of noncanonical Wnt signaling using &#x003b2;arr2 MO and dominant-negative forms of Dsh (Xdd1) and RhoA (RhoA-N19) (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, A&#x02013;G</xref>; and Table S1, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200710188/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200710188/DC1</ext-link>). Consistently, the CE-defective phenotypes caused by Ryk depletion were also rescued by the overexpression of Dsh, &#x003b2;arr2, and the constitutively active form of RhoA (RhoA-V14; Fig. S3 F), which indicates that Ryk functions upstream of the cytoplasmic molecules activated by Wnt11 in CE movements. The biochemical experiments between Dsh and Ryk showed that the cytoplasmic domain of Ryk is important to interact with Dsh (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 F</xref>). We further tested whether this domain is required for Ryk function in CE movements. Interestingly, the XRyk &#x00394;C rescued the CE defects caused by XRyk (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 H</xref>) and Wnt11 (Table S1). Moreover, XRyk &#x00394;C did not induce the hyperphosphorylation of Dsh (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 I</xref>) or the membrane accumulation of RhoA in animal cap cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, J&#x02013;M</xref>). Collectively, these observations suggest that Ryk mediates the noncanonical Wnt pathway by controlling Dsh in CE movements.</p><fig position="float" id="fig4"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p><bold>Ryk acts as an essential regulator of noncanonical Wnt signaling on CE movements.</bold> (A) Ryk, like Fz7, phosphorylated Dsh.
