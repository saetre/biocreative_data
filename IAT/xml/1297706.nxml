An anaerobic repression of <italic>sdhCDAB</italic> is known to be mediated by the ArcB/A two-component system and the global Fnr anaerobic regulator. While the cAMP receptor protein (CRP) and Cra (formerly FruR) are known as key mediators of catabolite repression, they have been excluded from the glucose repression of the <italic>sdhCDAB</italic> operon. Although the glucose repression of <italic>sdhCDAB</italic> was reported to involve a mechanism dependent on the <italic>ptsG</italic> expression, the molecular mechanism underlying the glucose repression has never been clarified. In this study, we re-examined the mechanism of the <italic>sdhCDAB</italic> repression by glucose and found that CRP directly regulates expression of the <italic>sdhCDAB</italic> operon and that the glucose repression of this operon occurs in a cAMP-dependent manner. The levels of phosphorylated enzyme IIA<sup>Glc</sup> and intracellular cAMP on various carbon sources were proportional to the expression levels of <italic>sdhC-lacZ</italic>. Disruption of <italic>crp</italic> or <italic>cya</italic> completely abolished the glucose repression of <italic>sdhC-lacZ</italic> expression. Together with data showing correlation between the intracellular cAMP concentrations and the <italic>sdhC-lacZ</italic> expression levels in several mutants and wild type, <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription assays suggest that the decrease in the CRP&#x000b7;cAMP level in the presence of glucose is the major determinant of the glucose repression of the <italic>sdhCDAB</italic> operon.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The term carbon catabolite repression is currently in use to describe the general phenomenon in microorganisms whereby the presence of a carbon source in the medium can repress expression of certain genes and operons, whose gene products are often concerned with catabolism of alternative carbon sources. The mechanisms of carbon catabolite repression in response to rapidly metabolizable carbon sources have been extensively examined in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>). In the vast majority of documented cases, the preferred carbon source is glucose with the famous <italic>E.coli</italic> glucose&#x02013;lactose diauxie as the classical example. The glucose-mediated catabolite repression, termed glucose repression, is mainly mediated by the proteins of the phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP):sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS). This system consists of sugar-specific PTS permeases, also referred to as enzymes II, and two general PTS proteins, enzyme I and histidine-containing protein (HPr), that participate in the phosphorylation of all PTS-transported carbohydrates. The glucose-specific PTS proteins consist of the soluble enzyme IIA<sup>Glc</sup> (EIIA<sup>Glc</sup>) and the membrane-bound enzyme IICB<sup>Glc</sup> (EIICB<sup>Glc</sup>). During translocation of glucose, a phosphoryl group derived from PEP is transferred sequentially along a series of proteins (enzyme I, HPr, EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> and EIICB<sup>Glc</sup>) to the transported glucose molecule.</p><p>Central to carbon catabolite repression is the phosphorylation state of EIIA<sup>Glc</sup>. In the presence of glucose, unphosphorylated EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> binds and inhibits various proteins involved in uptake and metabolism of non-PTS carbohydrates by a mechanism termed inducer exclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref>). However, in the absence of glucose, adenylate cyclase is known to be activated to increase the intracellular amount of cAMP, the allosteric effector necessary for the cAMP receptor protein (CRP) to bind efficiently to DNA and activate transcription at more than 100 promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref>). A popular model for the regulation of adenylate cyclase activity is that the phosphorylated form of EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> generated in the absence of glucose stimulates adenylate cyclase activity; thus, glucose transport is presumed to lead to dephosphorylation of IIA<sup>Glc</sup>, resulting in a de-activation of adenylate cyclase and the glucose repression of many genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>). Recently, the dephospho-form of EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> was also shown to interact with FrsA to regulate the flux between respiration and fermentation pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>), supporting importance of EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> in catabolic regulations.</p><p>Expression of the <italic>E.coli sdhCDAB</italic> operon encoding the succinate dehydrogenase complex, the sole membrane-bound enzyme of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, has also been known to be regulated in response to carbon supply as well as anaerobiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). Recent study also revealed that a small RNA, RyhB, down-regulates the mRNA level for <italic>sdhCDAB</italic> operon at the post-transcriptional initiation level in response to iron availability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>). For the anaerobic repression of <italic>sdhCDAB</italic>, two global regulatory circuits were shown to be involved: the ArcB/A two-component system and the Fnr anaerobic regulator modulate <italic>sdhCDAB</italic> expression over a 70-fold range to provide different amounts of enzyme depending on the cells' needs for energy and carbon intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>). While the molecular mechanisms underlying the anaerobic repression and the iron availability-dependent regulation have been well documented, the mechanism underlying the glucose repression is still not clear. Although CRP and Cra are known to be the key regulators of catabolite repression, they had been dismissed from the glucose repression of the <italic>sdhCDAB</italic> operon, although a putative CRP-binding site was proposed to be located on the <italic>sdhC</italic> promoter region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>). Through a series of genetic analyses to identify the regulator gene(s) involved in the glucose repression of the <italic>sdhCDAB</italic> operon, it was reported that the EIICB<sup>Glc</sup> protein acts as a crucial mediator in the glucose repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). Recently, it has been shown that the dephospho-form of EIICB<sup>Glc</sup> can sequester the global repressor Mlc through the direct protein&#x02013;protein interaction and induce the expression of the Mlc regulon including the genes encoding PTS proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>). Although Takeda <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>) identified <italic>mlc</italic> as the gene responsible for the multicopy effect on the glucose repression of the <italic>sdhCDAB</italic> operon, they concluded that the single copy <italic>mlc</italic> gene on the chromosome is not directly involved in the mechanism of glucose repression of the operon.</p><p>In this study, we re-investigated regulation of the <italic>sdhCDAB</italic> expression by glucose and the PTS to elucidate the mechanism underlying the glucose repression. We conclude that the general carbon catabolite repression regulator CRP directly mediates the glucose repression of the <italic>sdhCDAB</italic> operon in a cAMP-dependent manner.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title><p>Cyclic AMP and orthonitrophenyl-&#x003b2;-<sc>d</sc>-galactopyranoside (ONPG) were obtained from Sigma.

As the ArcA anaerobic repressor is known to serve as the major transcriptional regulator of the <italic>sdhCDAB</italic> operon, we monitored the effect of <italic>arcA</italic> deletion on the glucose repression of <italic>sdhC-lacZ</italic> expression. While deletion of the <italic>arcA</italic> gene resulted in increase of <italic>sdhC-lacZ</italic> expression as expected from the previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>), it did not show any remarkable effect on the glucose repression of <italic>sdhC-lacZ</italic> expression. As a previous study had shown that the glucose repression of <italic>sdhC-lacZ</italic> expression is <italic>ptsG</italic>-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>), we tested the effect of the two glucose-specific PTS genes, <italic>crr</italic> and <italic>ptsG</italic> encoding EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> and EIICB<sup>Glc</sup>, respectively, on <italic>sdhC-lacZ</italic> expression. Deletion mutations of <italic>crr</italic> and <italic>ptsG</italic> were transduced into the TSDH00 strain to generate strains TSDH02 and TSDH03, respectively, and &#x003b2;-galactosidase activities of these strains were measured. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, the glucose repression was negligible in the <italic>crr</italic> deletion mutant when compared with wild type: growth of the TSDH02 strain in LB with glucose resulted in only a marginal decrease (&#x0223c;1.5 fold) of <italic>sdhC-lacZ</italic> expression when compared with that without glucose. Deletion of <italic>ptsG</italic> resulted in the complete loss of glucose repression of <italic>sdhC-lacZ</italic> expression in agreement with the previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). Loss of glucose repression of <italic>sdhC-lacZ</italic> expression in TSDH02 and TSDH03 implies that the glucose-specific PTS proteins play crucial roles in the glucose repression of <italic>sdhCDAB</italic> expression.</p><p>In agreement with the previous study by Takeda <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>), the results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> demonstrate the complete loss of the glucose repression of <italic>sdhC-lacZ</italic> expression in <italic>ptsG</italic> mutant. It was previously shown that the induction of <italic>ptsG</italic> and <italic>ptsHIcrr</italic> expression by glucose was also <italic>ptsG</italic>-dependent, and various studies showed that Mlc is the repressor responsible for this glucose induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>). Further studies revealed that the dephospho-form of EIICB<sup>Glc</sup> could sequester the global repressor Mlc through the direct protein&#x02013;protein interaction and induce expression of the Mlc regulon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>). Thus, the simplest model that could account for the glucose repression of <italic>sdhCDAB</italic> expression and its dependence on <italic>ptsG</italic> was the existence of a transcription regulator interacting with EIICB<sup>Glc</sup> and repressing the expression of the <italic>sdhCDAB</italic> operon in the presence of glucose. To search for a protein(s) interacting with EIICB<sup>Glc</sup> and thus mediating the glucose repression of <italic>sdhCDAB</italic> expression, we carried out a ligand fishing experiment. When the crude extracts prepared from MG1655 and its isogenic <italic>mlc</italic> mutant were mixed with EIIB or 6His-tagged form of EIIB (His-EIIB) and subjected to pull-down assays using the BD TALON&#x02122; metal affinity resin, we could not find out any proteins other than Mlc that specifically interacted with the glucose-sensing EIIB domain of the <italic>ptsG</italic> gene product (data not shown). Although it is well established that Mlc is the global transcription repressor regulating expression of many genes in response to the presence of glucose, the possibility that Mlc may participate in the glucose repression of <italic>sdhCDAB</italic> expression was ruled out as the <italic>mlc</italic> null mutant, TSDH04, still exhibited the glucose repression of <italic>sdhC-lacZ</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), in agreement with a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Regulation of <italic>sdhCDAB</italic> expression by the CRP&#x000b7;cAMP complex</title><p>Considering the fact that only Mlc, which is known to exist in a very limiting concentration in <italic>E.coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>), could be fished out from the crude extract of MG1655 using EIIB as bait (data not shown), we assumed that the glucose repression of the <italic>sdhCDAB</italic> operon might not involve any transcription regulators interacting with EIICB<sup>Glc</sup> in <italic>E.coli</italic> and that the effect of <italic>ptsG</italic> on the glucose repression of <italic>sdhCDAB</italic> expression might be indirect.</p><p>To search for the <italic>cis</italic>-acting region(s) responsible for regulation of the glucose repression of the <italic>sdhCDAB</italic> operon, a series of single-copy transcriptional <italic>lacZ</italic> fusion constructs containing various promoter regions of <italic>sdhC</italic> were generated and introduced into the <italic>E.coli</italic> strain MC4100. The glucose repression of <italic>sdhC</italic> expression in TSDH00 and four different 5&#x02032; deletion constructs of <italic>sdhC-lacZ</italic> fusion, TSDH10, TSDH20, TSDH30 and TSDH40, was monitored in cultures grown aerobically in the presence or absence of glucose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Disruption of the upstream ArcA site centered at &#x02212;205 bp relative to the transcription start site (the TSDH10 strain) modestly reduced the level of aerobic gene expression as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>), while deletion of the DNA region containing the ArcA site centered at &#x02212;119 elevated the level of aerobic <italic>sdhC-lacZ</italic> expression (TSDH20 strain). Regardless of the changes in the aerobic <italic>sdhC-lacZ</italic> expression levels, both the promoter fusions TSDH10 and TSDH20 still exhibited the glucose repression of <italic>sdhC-lacZ</italic> expression to significant levels similar to wild-type TSDH00 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). On the construct TSDH30, <italic>lacZ</italic> was fused to the region covering from &#x02212;60 to +450 bp relative to the <italic>sdhC</italic> transcription start, and thus the presumed CRP-binding site centered at &#x02212;79.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>) was deleted but it still retains the ArcA binding site centered at &#x02212;28 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref>). This construct resulted in the significant reduction of &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity and growth of the TSDH30 strain in LB with glucose resulted in only a marginal decrease (1.49 fold) of <italic>sdhC-lacZ</italic> expression when compared with growth without glucose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). These results indicate that the factor mediating the glucose repression may bind to the region extending from &#x02212;126 to &#x02212;60 relative to the transcription start site of the <italic>sdhC</italic> promoter, where the presumed CRP-binding site is located (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29">29</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). Since it was reported that the <italic>crp</italic> deletion mutant cell still showed the glucose repression of <italic>sdhC</italic>-<italic>lacZ</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>), it had been believed that a regulator other than CRP would be responsible for the glucose repression of <italic>sdhCDAB</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>). The promoter deletion experiments in this study, however, led us to speculate that CRP may be the direct regulator of the glucose repression of <italic>sdhCDAB</italic> expression. Therefore, we mutated the putative CRP binding site centered at &#x02212;79.5 to check whether it is directly involved in the glucose repression of <italic>sdh</italic> expression. TSDH50, which contains a single copy of the <italic>sdhC-lacZ</italic> transcriptional fusion gene with mutated CRP binding site (CGTGACCTGGATCACT to CTCTGCCTGGACTGCA), resulted in the significant reduction of &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity and almost complete loss of the glucose repression of <italic>lacZ</italic> expression similar to the TSDH30 strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). From these results, we concluded that the CRP binding site on the <italic>sdhC</italic> promoter region is directly involved in the glucose repression of <italic>sdhCDAB</italic> expression.</p><p>The involvement of CRP and cAMP on the glucose repression of <italic>sdhC</italic> expression was further investigated using two deletion mutants lacking either CRP or cAMP production. Cells of the <italic>crp</italic> mutant strain, SA2777, were used to generate an isogenic <italic>crp</italic> deletion mutant of the parental strain TSDH00 by P1 transduction. After <italic>crp</italic> deletion was confirmed by western blot analysis using anti-CRP polyclonal antibody in this strain, TSDH05 (data not shown), &#x003b2;-galactosidase activities were measured in TSDH05 cells grown in LB media in the presence and absence of glucose. Contrary to the previous report, the glucose repression was completely abolished in this mutant strain (compare data for the <italic>crp</italic> mutant with wild type in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). The <italic>sdhC-lacZ</italic> expression of TSDH05 grown in LB was even lower than that of wild-type cells grown in the presence of glucose, indicating that CRP is directly involved in the regulation of <italic>sdhCDAB</italic> expression. To determine whether the glucose repression of <italic>sdhC</italic>-<italic>lacZ</italic> expression is dependent on cAMP, an isogenic <italic>cya</italic> deletion mutant of TSDH00 was also generated by P1 transduction from the CA8000&#x00394;<italic>cya</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30">30</xref>). The <italic>sdhC-lacZ</italic> expression in this mutant strain TSDH06 showed a similar pattern with that of TSDH05 and was not affected by the presence of glucose (<italic>cya</italic> mutant in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). From these results, we concluded that the CRP&#x000b7;cAMP complex is one of the major transcriptional regulators of the <italic>sdhCDAB</italic> operon and it is directly involved in the glucose repression of <italic>sdhCDAB</italic>.</p><p>To confirm the direct involvement of CRP and cAMP in the glucose repression of the <italic>sdhCDAB</italic> operon, we tested the effect of episomally expressed CRP and cAMP added in the medium on <italic>sdhC-lacZ</italic> expression in the two mutant cells. The genomic DNA fragment containing the <italic>crp</italic> gene including its own promoter was cloned into the low copy number plasmid pBR322, and the product pBRcrp was transformed into the <italic>crp</italic> deletion mutant to see whether the glucose repression phenotype is recovered. The episomal expression of CRP increased the <italic>sdhC-lacZ</italic> expression in TSDH05 cells and the TSDH05 cells transformed with pBRcrp showed the glucose-dependent repression of <italic>sdhC</italic>-<italic>lacZ</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). The <italic>sdhC-lacZ</italic> expression of TSDH05 cells harboring pBRcrp grown in the absence of glucose showed &#x0223c;1.8-fold higher &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity than that of cells grown in the presence of glucose, while TSDH05 cells harboring pBR322 showed the lower &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity regardless of the presence of glucose. These results suggest that elimination of the glucose repression of <italic>sdhCDAB</italic> expression in TSDH05 resulted from the failure of activation of gene expression by CRP. Inducibility of the <italic>sdhC</italic> promoter by cAMP was also investigated in the <italic>cya</italic> mutant strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). The <italic>sdhC-lacZ</italic> expression level in TSDH06 cells was not significantly changed during the cell growth (filled circles). When 1 mM of cAMP was added to the growth medium, however, the <italic>sdhC-lacZ</italic> expression of TSDH06 cells was increased to &#x0223c;3-fold within 1 h. These results support that intracellular cAMP production as well as <italic>crp</italic> expression plays a crucial role in the regulation of <italic>sdhCDAB</italic> expression.</p></sec><sec><title>The CRP&#x000b7;cAMP complex binds to the <italic>sdhC</italic> promoter and regulates transcription <italic>in vitro</italic></title><p>To show the direct binding of the CRP&#x000b7;cAMP complex to the <italic>sdhC</italic> promoter <italic>in vitro</italic>, gel shift assays were carried out using purified CRP and the <italic>sdhC</italic> promoter fragment in the presence of cAMP. The results showed that CRP&#x000b7;cAMP specifically binds to the s<italic>dhC</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). As the amount of CRP added in the reaction mixture increased, the amount of the CRP&#x02013;promoter DNA complex also increased. Binding affinity of the CRP&#x000b7;cAMP complex toward the <italic>sdhC</italic> promoter was comparable with that toward the <italic>ptsG</italic> promoter.</p><p>To investigate the effect of CRP&#x000b7;cAMP binding to the promoter on <italic>sdhCDAB</italic> transcription, the <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription assay was performed with a supercoiled DNA template (pTSDHpro) containing base pairs &#x02212;183 to +209 relative to the transcription start site, covering the <italic>sdhC</italic> promoter and its CRP and ArcA binding sites. When RNA polymerase alone was present in the reaction, transcription from the <italic>sdhC</italic> promoter did not occur efficiently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, lane 1). The addition of CRP and cAMP, however, remarkably increased the promoter activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, lanes 2&#x02013;5). Most intriguingly, incubation of the reaction mixture with ArcA-P repressed the CRP-activated promoter activity in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, lanes 6&#x02013;8). The specificity of CRP&#x000b7;cAMP function in <italic>sdhCDAB</italic> transcription was confirmed by the consistent activity of <italic>rep</italic> that originates from replication origin of the DNA template regardless of the presence of CRP and ArcA-P.

From the above results, it could be assumed that the different expression levels of <italic>sdhC-lacZ</italic> on various sugars might result from the change in the intracellular cAMP concentration depending on the type of carbon source. To verify this assumption, the relationship between the intracellular cAMP concentrations and &#x003b2;-galactosidase activities was determined in TSDH00 cells grown in LB with various carbon sources. &#x003b2;-Galactosidase activities of TSDH00 revealed the carbon source-dependent expression of <italic>sdhC-lacZ</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Growth with mannose, fructose or maltose did not affect the expression level of <italic>sdhC-lacZ</italic>, while <italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosamine and galactose showed the similar effect with glucose on <italic>sdhC-lacZ</italic> expression. To investigate the effect of cAMP on <italic>sdhC</italic>-<italic>lacZ</italic> expression, the levels of intracellular cAMP were also measured (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). The intracellular cAMP level in TSDH00 cells decreased when glucose was added to the medium, in agreement with the previous reports [reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>)]. The intracellular cAMP level in cells grown on glucose, <italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosamine or galactose was lower than that in cells grown on mannose, fructose or maltose. The result showed that carbon source-dependent expression of <italic>sdhC-lacZ</italic> is in accordance with the intracellular cAMP concentration. Although the mechanism for the regulation of the intracellular cAMP level is not fully understood, a popular model for the regulation of adenylate cyclase activity is that phosphorylated EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> stimulates adenylate cyclase activity and increases the intracellular cAMP concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>). Therefore, we measured the level of EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> phosphorylation in the cells grown with various carbon sources by western blot analysis according to the procedure developed by Takahashi <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>) as described under &#x02018;Materials and Methods&#x02019; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). It is well established that phosphorylated EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> migrates slower than the dephosphorylated form on an SDS&#x02013;polyacrylamide gel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref>). The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A and B</xref> show that there is a general correlation between the level of EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> phosphorylation and the intracellular cAMP concentration in the cells grown on each carbon source: the level of phosphorylated EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> in cells grown with glucose, <italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosamine or galactose was lower than that in cells grown with mannose, fructose or maltose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Taken together with above results, this result led us to the conclusion that the different phosphorylation state of EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> on each sugar reflects the different cAMP concentration in the cell, and consequently the different <italic>sdhCDAB</italic> expression level depending on the type of carbon source added to the medium. From these facts, it could be predicted that the <italic>ptsG</italic> gene plays an indirect role and the <italic>crr</italic> gene product is the major determinant on the glucose repression of <italic>sdhC</italic> expression. It could be assumed that the level of EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> phosphorylation may be unaffected by glucose in the <italic>ptsG</italic> mutant because EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> cannot pass the phosphate group on to EIICB<sup>Glc</sup>. To verify this, we measured the level of EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> phosphorylation in <italic>ptsG</italic> cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, glucose in the growth medium did not affect the phosphorylation state of EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> in the <italic>ptsG</italic> mutant cells. Based on these results, it is assumed that the loss of glucose repression of <italic>sdhCDAB</italic> expression in the <italic>ptsG</italic> mutant results from the lack of glucose-dependent regulation of the EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> phosphorylation state in the mutant that affects the level of intracellular cAMP.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>It was reported that activities of <italic>E.coli</italic> TCA cycle enzymes such as succinate dehydrogenase are remarkably reduced during anaerobiosis and in the presence of glucose in the medium almost 40 years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref>).

Furthermore, the <italic>mlc</italic> mutant still showed the glucose repression of <italic>sdhCDAB</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>); (iv) in a previous review, it was proposed that catabolite repression of the <italic>sdhCDAB</italic> operon is controlled presumably by the CRP&#x000b7;cAMP complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>). (v) Finally, recent reports on the transcriptome analyses of the <italic>crp</italic> mutant using microarray techniques indicated that expression of the <italic>sdhCDAB</italic> operon was affected by deletion of the <italic>crp</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>). It was proposed that the <italic>sdhCDAB</italic> operon might actually be regulated by the CRP homologue Fnr <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>), based on the facts that Fnr has been shown to regulate <italic>sdhCDAB</italic> expression in response to anaerobiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref>), the consensus sequence for Fnr is similar to that for CRP, and both proteins can bind to the DNA site for the other protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>).</p><p>From the results in this study, it is evident that CRP is directly involved in the regulation of <italic>sdhCDAB</italic> expression and the glucose repression of <italic>sdhCDAB</italic> occurs in a cAMP-dependent manner. Genetic studies using <italic>cya</italic> and <italic>crp</italic> mutants and the <italic>sdhC-lacZ</italic> fusion strain harboring the mutated <italic>crp</italic> binding site on the <italic>sdhC</italic> promoter region suggest that both cAMP and CRP are required for <italic>sdhCDAB</italic> expression and its glucose repression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). <italic>In vitro</italic> studies demonstrate binding of CRP to the <italic>sdhC</italic> promoter and activation by the CRP&#x000b7;cAMP complex of <italic>sdhC</italic> transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Furthermore, the phosphorylation level of EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> in cells grown with different carbon sources correlates with the intracellular concentration of cAMP and the <italic>sdhC-lacZ</italic> expression level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). It was previously reported that the phosphorylation level of EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> is dependent on the type of carbon source in the medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref>). Although no biochemical evidence has been provided, it is generally believed that the phosphorylated form of EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> stimulates adenylate cyclase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>). In the presence of glucose, <italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosamine or galactose in the medium, the level of the phospho-form of EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). This decrease seems to be responsible for reduced activity of adenylate cyclase and reduced production of cAMP required to activate <italic>sdhCDAB</italic> expression after binding to its receptor protein CRP. Thus, we conclude that the CRP&#x000b7;cAMP complex mediates the glucose repression of the <italic>sdhCDAB</italic> operon. There still remains one question why the <italic>ptsG</italic> mutant exerts a more profound effect than mutation of <italic>crr</italic> on the glucose repression of the <italic>sdhCDAB</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), that is in conflict with our conclusion that the <italic>crr</italic> gene product EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> is the major regulator in orchestrating glucose repression of the <italic>sdhCDAB</italic> promoter. One possibility for this conflict may be due to the pleiotropic effect of the <italic>ptsG</italic> and <italic>crr</italic> mutants on expression of many genes expected from the fact that both EIICB<sup>Glc</sup> and EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> interact with and regulate activities of many regulatory proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref>). More studies need to be carried out to fully understand this question.</p><p>Under fully aerobic conditions, the TCA cycle in <italic>E.coli</italic> operates as an oxidative pathway that needs the activities of succinate dehydrogenase, encoded by <italic>sdhCDAB</italic>, and &#x003b1;-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. In the presence of readily fermentable sugars and/or under anaerobic conditions, however, the TCA cycle hardly operates in an oxidative way because coupling of the pathway to terminal respiration is absolutely required to maintain the activities of the succinate dehydrogenase complex and &#x003b1;-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex that produce FADH<sub>2</sub> and NADH, respectively. On the other hand, the reactions that make oxaloacetate, succinyl-coenzyme A and &#x003b1;-ketoglutarate are necessary because these intermediates are still required for the biosynthesis of amino acids and tetrapyrroles. Under these conditions, the TCA cycle is converted from an oxidative and cyclic into a reductive and branched pathway to solve the problem. In the reductive pathway, succinyl-coenzyme A is made by reversing the reactions between oxaloacetate and succinyl-coenzyme A, using the enzyme fumarate reductase instead of succinate dehydrogenase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>). Thus, the decreased <italic>sdhCDAB</italic> expression by carbon catabolite repression in the presence of glucose provides one of the mechanisms to maintain the TCA cycle in a reductive pathway, leading to accumulation of succinate and succinyl-coenzyme A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>). The <italic>sdhCDAB</italic> operon in this study is not the first example of genes encoding the TCA cycle enzymes whose expression are activated by CRP and repressed by ArcA and Fnr. The <italic>acnB</italic>, encoding one of the two aconitases differentially expressed in <italic>E.coli</italic>, has been shown to be regulated in the same way as the <italic>sdhCDAB</italic> operon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>). Intriguingly, expression of both <italic>fumA</italic> and <italic>sdhCDAB</italic> was recently shown to be down-regulated by the small RNA, RyhB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>). Expression of the <italic>fumA</italic> and <italic>fumC</italic> genes encoding two fumarase isozymes of the TCA cycle in <italic>E.coli</italic> was also shown to be subject to the glucose repression and require cAMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>). Thus, decrease in the CRP&#x000b7;cAMP level in the presence of readily fermentable glucose seems to be responsible for the reduced expression of genes encoding enzymes necessary to maintain the TCA cycle in an oxidative pathway and conversion of the cycle into a reductive pathway.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by the Korea Research Foundation Grant (KRF-2004-015-C00480) and the 21C Frontier Microbial Genomics and Applications Center Program (Grant MG05-0202-6-0), Republic of Korea.
