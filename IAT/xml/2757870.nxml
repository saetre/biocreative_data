X box binding protein 1 (XBP1) is a transcription factor that mediates one branch of the UPR and is crucial for the development of antibody-secreting PCs. PCs represent only one class of terminally differentiated B cells, however, and little is known about the role for XBP1 in the other class: memory B cells. We have developed an XBP1<sup>fl/fl</sup> CD19<sup>+/cre</sup> conditional knockout (XBP1<sup>CD19</sup>) mouse to build upon our current understanding of the function of XBP1 in PC differentiation as well as to explore the role of XBP1 in memory cell development. Using this model, we show that XBP1<sup>CD19</sup> mice are protected from disease in an autoantibody-mediated mouse lupus model. We also identify a novel developmental stage at which B cells express the traditional PC marker CD138 (syndecan-1) but have yet to undergo XBP1-dependent functional and morphological differentiation into antibody-secreting cells. Finally, we show that memory B cells develop normally in XBP1<sup>CD19</sup> mice, demonstrating that XBP1-mediated functions occur independently of any memory cell lineage commitment.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Proper protein folding is essential for normal immunoglobulin synthesis and secretion in antibody-secreting plasma cells (PCs). The mammalian unfolded protein response (UPR) is a signaling pathway that responds to ER stress that is induced by the accumulation of unfolded proteins within the ER lumen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Todd et al., 2008</xref>). Inositol-requiring transmembrane kinase/endonuclease 1 (IRE1) is an ER-localized transmembrane protein that senses unfolded proteins and serves to activate X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1), a member of the CREB/ATF basic leucine zipper family of transcription factors and a crucial mediator of one branch of the UPR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yoshida et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Calfon et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lee et al., 2002</xref>). IRE1 possesses endoribonuclease activity that excises a 26-nt sequence from XBP1 messenger RNA (mRNA). This event, termed XBP1 splicing, shifts the reading frame to excise a premature stop codon, resulting in a full-length functional XBP1 protein product (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yoshida et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Calfon et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lee et al., 2002</xref>). XBP1 then translocates to the nucleus where it induces target genes involved in protein synthesis and secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Shaffer et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lee et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>XBP1 activation is crucial to the normal function and survival of highly secretory cells such as exocrine gland acinar cells and Paneth cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kaser et al., 2008</xref>). Using XBP1/RAG2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> lymphoid chimeric mice, we have shown previously that XBP1 expression is required for normal PC development and function as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Reimold et al., 2001</xref>). Chimeric mice demonstrated markedly reduced serum Ig levels and impaired Ig response to immunization. This defect was the result of a failure of cells to up-regulate UPR-related XBP1 target genes during terminal B cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Iwakoshi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Shaffer et al., 2004</xref>). The requirement of XBP1 for PC differentiation raises the possibility that disruption of XBP1 activity may represent a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), in which autoantibodies may be directly pathogenic.</p><p>Little is known about the role of XBP1 in the development and function of another important B cell population: memory B cells. These B cells have been exposed to antigen, undergo a germinal center (GC) reaction, and function to differentiate rapidly into antibody-secreting B cells after reexposure to cognate antigen (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">McHeyzer-Williams and McHeyzer-Williams, 2005</xref>). They do not express CD138 (syndecan-1), a cell surface glycoprotein which has traditionally been used a marker for Ig-secreting PCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sanderson and B&#x000f8;rset, 2002</xref>). Memory B cells also function to replete the pool of long-lived antibody-secreting PCs (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">McHeyzer-Williams and McHeyzer-Williams, 2005</xref>), which may represent a persistent source of autoantibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Neubert et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>The recent development of a XBP1<sup>flox</sup> conditional KO (cKO) mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hetz et al., 2008</xref>) has prompted us to explore further the function of XBP1 in terminal B cell development. CD19 expression is limited to B cells and occurs in pro&#x02013;B cells and throughout the remaining stages of B cell development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zhou et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Hardy and Hayakawa, 2001</xref>). We therefore bred the XBP1<sup>flox</sup> cKO mouse to a mouse expressing cre recombinase under the control of CD19 promoter to delete XBP1 selectively from B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rickert et al., 1997</xref>). In the current series of experiments, we use XBP1<sup>flox/flox</sup> CD19<sup>cre/+</sup> (XBP1<sup>CD19</sup>) cKO mice first to confirm the functional PC defects in XBP1/RAG2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> lymphoid chimeric mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Reimold et al., 2001</xref>). In addition, we now report that XBP1<sup>CD19</sup> mice were protected from mouse lupus. We also show, unexpectedly, that the number of cells with the traditional B220<sup>int</sup> CD138<sup>+</sup> PC phenotype is normal in XBP1<sup>CD19</sup> mice as compared with XBP1<sup>flox/flox</sup> CD19<sup>+/+</sup> (XBP1<sup>+/+</sup>) controls. Finally, we report that XBP1<sup>CD19</sup> mice have normal populations of memory B cells, demonstrating that this alternative differentiation pathway for B cells is not dependent on the XBP1 branch of the UPR.</p><sec><title>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</title><sec><title>Initial characterization of XBP1<sup>CD19</sup> cKO mice</title><p>To determine the efficiency of XBP1 deletion in the B cells in XBP1<sup>CD19</sup> mice, splenocytes from these mice were isolated and separated into B220<sup>+</sup> and B220<sup>&#x02212;</sup> populations using magnetic beads coupled to an anti-B220 mAb. Southern blotting demonstrated efficient and specific deletion of XBP1 in the B220<sup>+</sup> (B cell) fraction (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20090738/DC1">Fig. S1 A</ext-link>). There were no differences in cell surface expression of IgM and IgD between XBP1<sup>CD19</sup> and XBP1<sup>+/+</sup> splenocytes (Fig. S1 B). In accord with the known function of XBP1 in PC development, basal Ig levels were markedly reduced in XBP1<sup>CD19</sup> mice (Fig. S1 C). Furthermore, these mice exhibited impaired Ig responses to the T cell&#x02013;dependent antigen nitrophenol (NP)-KLH upon primary or secondary stimulation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20090738/DC1">Fig. S2, A and B</ext-link>, respectively). A similar defect was observed in mice immunized with the T cell&#x02013;independent antigen NP-ficoll (Fig. S2 C).</p><p>XBP1 up-regulates the expression of UPR-related target genes that function collectively in protein synthesis and secretion. XBP1 targets include the ER-associated degradation protein EDEM, ER-localized chaperones like ER-localized Dnajb9 (ERdj4), the ER translocon component Sec61&#x003b1;, and proteins, such as protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), that aid disulfide bond formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Todd et al., 2008</xref>). Using B220<sup>+</sup> splenocytes isolated from XBP1<sup>CD19</sup> and XBP1<sup>+/+</sup> mice, we next measured the expression of XBP1 target genes in these B cells after culture for 0&#x02013;3 d in the presence or absence of 10 &#x000b5;g/ml LPS (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20090738/DC1">Fig. S3 A</ext-link>). As expected, quantitative PCR analysis demonstrated that, by day 3 of culture, there were significant increases in the expression of the aforementioned XBP1 target genes in XBP1<sup>+/+</sup> B cells. These same target genes were up-regulated to a lesser degree or not at all in XBP1<sup>CD19</sup> B cells. In addition, XBP1<sup>CD19</sup> B cells did not demonstrate an appropriate up-regulation of &#x003bc;S, which normally allows for newly synthesized IgM to be secreted. Importantly, B cells from XBP1<sup>CD19</sup> and XBP1<sup>+/+</sup> mice showed no difference in their modest increase in expression of Ig heavy chain binding protein (BiP), another UPR related gene which is not directly downstream of XBP1.</p><p>XBP1 deletion did not affect B cell proliferation or viability in response to LPS treatment. Both were comparable between XBP1<sup>CD19</sup> and XBP1<sup>+/+</sup> B cells as measured by exclusion of 7-amino-actinomycin D (7-AAD) and annexin V (Fig. S3 B) or by exclusion of trypan blue (Fig. S3 C). In contrast, XBP1 deletion led to markedly reduced secretion of IgM by LPS-stimulated XBP1<sup>CD19</sup> B cells (Fig. S3 D). Collectively, these data demonstrate that XBP1 deletion leads to defects in the UPR that impair normal synthesis and secretion of immunoglobulin without affecting B cell viability or proliferative properties. Importantly, these initial experiments in XBP1<sup>CD19</sup> mice recapitulated the known roles of XBP1 in PC development and function, as has been shown previously using XBP1/RAG2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> lymphoid chimeric mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Reimold et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>We next investigated the impact of XBP1 deficiency on the broader network of transcriptional regulators that direct PC differentiation (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Calame et al., 2003</xref>). The transcription factors Bcl-6 (B cell lymphoma 6) and paired box gene 5 (Pax5) repress B lymphocyte&#x02013;induced maturation protein 1 (Blimp1) and IFN regulatory factor 4 (IRF4), respectively, and promote B cell proliferation and the GC reaction. On the contrary, Blimp1 and IRF4 normally arrest cell cycle progression and the GC reaction to promote and sustain PC development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Calame et al., 2003</xref>). Furthermore, Blimp1 and IRF4 permit the expression of XBP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Shaffer et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Klein et al., 2006</xref>). For Blimp1, this regulatory event is accomplished by Blimp1-mediated repression of Pax5, which derepresses XBP1 to ensure an appropriate UPR in anticipation of Ig production and secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Shaffer et al., 2004</xref>). Despite the failure to differentiate into Ig-secreting PCs, LPS-stimulated XBP1<sup>CD19</sup> B cells displayed a typical PC signature of these transcription factors: down-regulation of Pax5 and up-regulation of Blimp1 and IRF4 mRNAs. Interestingly, Blimp1 and IRF4 were substantially overexpressed in LPS-stimulated XBP1<sup>CD19</sup> B cells compared with XBP1<sup>+/+</sup> controls (Fig. S3 A). These data suggest that XBP1 deletion did not alter the genetic program of PC development. Furthermore, failure to up-regulate Ig secretion in the absence of XBP1 appears to promote the PC developmental program, supporting the hypothesis that a mechanism of feedback inhibition exists whereby XBP1 down-regulates Blimp1 and IRF4 expression in LPS-stimulated B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hu et al., 2009</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Mice with XBP1-deficient B cells are protected from mouse lupus</title><p>BALB/c mice develop anti&#x02013;double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) autoantibodies and immune complex deposits in glomeruli when immunized with a DNA mimotope, the decapeptide DWEYSVWLSN on a polylysine backbone (MAP-DWEYS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Putterman and Diamond, 1998</xref>). Furthermore, when treated with LPS to disrupt the blood brain barrier, MAP-DWEYS&#x02013;immunized mice develop lesions in the hippocampus of the brain, a process which is attributable to excitatory cell death induced by stimulatory autoantibodies bound to neuronal N-methyl-<sc>d</sc>-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kowal et al., 2004</xref>). Anti-NMDA receptor autoantibodies have also been identified in the cerebrospinal fluid of humans with SLE, and this mouse system has been used as a model of human central nervous system lupus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">DeGiorgio et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kowal et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>We next sought to use this mouse model of SLE to test whether XBP1<sup>CD19</sup> mice were capable of developing autoantibodies and associated pathological findings of mouse lupus. XBP1<sup>CD19</sup> and litter-matched XBP1<sup>+/+</sup> mice were immunized with MAP-DWEYS three times over a 1-mo period, as described in Materials and methods. Serum anti-peptide and anti-dsDNA antibodies were readily detected in XBP1<sup>+/+</sup> control mice but were only weakly present in XBP1<sup>CD19</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, A and B</xref>). These same mice were then treated with 3 mg/kg LPS and killed 4&#x02013;7 d later for immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis of kidney and brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>). IHC revealed abundant IgG in glomeruli of five out of five control mice and in the hippocampus of two out of five controls, but none was present in any of the XBP1<sup>CD19</sup> mouse tissues. Thus, mice with B cells deficient in XBP1 were protected from autoantibody production and disease expression in this mouse model of SLE.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Female XBP1<sup>+/+</sup> and XBP1<sup>CD19</sup> mice were immunized i.p. with 100 &#x000b5;g MAP-DWEYS in CFA followed by booster immunizations with 100 &#x000b5;g MAP-DWEYS in IFA on days 14 and 28.</bold> (A and B) On day 35, serum was tested for anti-DWEYS (peptide; A) and anti-dsDNA (B) antibodies by ELISA of four serum dilutions.

When treated with bortezomib, these lupus-prone mice lacked autoantibodies, were devoid of mature PCs, and were protected from mouse lupus. Proteasome inhibitors suppress ER-associated degradation pathways such that misfolded proteins accumulate in cells, cause ER stress, and induce the UPR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Obeng et al., 2006</xref>). Chronic ER stress, however, causes cell cycle arrest and cellular apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zinszner et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brewer and Diehl, 2000</xref>). Proteasome inhibitors like bortezomib are toxic to myeloma cells, in part through targeting the activity of IRE1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lee et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Obeng et al., 2006</xref>). These findings raise the intriguing notion that inhibition of XBP1 or the UPR in general may represent a potential therapeutic target in the treatment of autoantibody-mediated diseases like SLE.</p></sec><sec><title>The developmental defect in XBP1-deficient PCs occurs after CD138 expression</title><p>XBP1<sup>CD19</sup> mice allow us to explore further the developmental stage at which PC differentiation arrests. Complicating this analysis, however, is the observation that PCs down-regulate many B cell surface markers such as B220, CD19, and CD20 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Hardy and Hayakawa, 2001</xref>). Traditionally, cell surface expression of CD138 by B cells has been viewed as a marker for antibody-secreting PCs (B220<sup>int</sup> CD138<sup>+</sup> cells; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sanderson and B&#x000f8;rset, 2002</xref>). Accordingly, we immunized XBP1<sup>CD19</sup> and XBP1<sup>+/+</sup> mice with NP-KLH to measure the distribution of B220 and CD138 staining over time. Surprisingly, even though XBP1<sup>CD19</sup> mice had markedly impaired Ig responses to immunization (Fig. S2), both XBP1<sup>CD19</sup> and XBP1<sup>+/+</sup> mice had comparable numbers of B220<sup>int</sup> CD138<sup>+</sup> splenocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>). In XBP1<sup>CD19</sup> mice, these cells lacked the expanded ER and perinuclear cuff of Golgi found in normal PCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>). This difference was quantifiable; B220<sup>int</sup> CD138<sup>+</sup> cells from XBP1<sup>CD19</sup> mice demonstrated less intensive staining by brefeldin A boron-dipyrromethane (BODIPY), which selectively binds to secretory ER and Golgi content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hetz et al., 2008</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>XBP1<sup>+/+</sup> and XBP1<sup>CD19</sup> mice were immunized i.p. with a single 100-&#x000b5;g dose of NP-KLH in alum.</bold> (A) Representative flow cytometry of cell surface CD138 (y axis) and B220 (x axis) expression in splenocytes isolated from XBP1<sup>+/+</sup> and XBP1<sup>CD19</sup> mice at days 0, 5, and 14 after immunization.

In accord with what is known about PCs, B220<sup>int</sup> CD138<sup>+</sup> cells from XBP1<sup>+/+</sup> mice expressed much greater levels of the XBP1 target genes ERdj4, EDEM, PDI, and Sec61 as compared with B220<sup>+</sup> CD138<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cells from the same mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>). There were also increased levels of BiP, &#x003bc;S, Blimp1, and IRF4 and reduced levels of Pax5. These differences were also observed, but to a much lesser degree, in the two sorted XBP1<sup>CD19</sup> B cell populations. When comparing B220<sup>int</sup> CD138<sup>+</sup> cells from XBP1<sup>CD19</sup> and XBP1<sup>+/+</sup> mice, XBP1 target genes and &#x003bc;S were reduced in expression in cKO cells, and levels of BiP and Pax5 were similar. Unlike what was observed in LPS-stimulated B cells, however, levels of Blimp1 and IRF4 were not elevated in cells from XBP1<sup>CD19</sup> mice. This supports the hypothesis that there are multiple pathways of B cell differentiation depending on the specific exogenous stimulus. Indeed, in vitro LPS-stimulated B cells behave differently than in vivo immunogen-stimulated B cells, and this is likely caused, in part, by the absence of T helper cell activity as well as by the different activation pathways involved (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">McHeyzer-Williams and McHeyzer-Williams, 2005</xref>).</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p><bold>XBP1<sup>+/+</sup> and XBP1<sup>CD19</sup> mice were immunized i.p. with a single 100-&#x000b5;g dose of NP-KLH in alum.</bold> At day 5 after immunization, splenocytes were isolated and sorted by FACS for B220<sup>+</sup> CD138<sup>&#x02212;</sup> (B220) and B220<sup>int</sup> CD138<sup>+</sup> (CD138) populations.

This occurs before achieving normal PC morphology and functional activity because of a failure to up-regulate XBP1-dependent UPR target genes. CD138 is a member of the syndecan family of heparin sulfate proteoglycans and is comprised of a transmembrane core protein covalently bonded to heparin sulfate moieties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sanderson and Yang, 2008</xref>). CD138 also exists as part of the bone marrow stroma and in a soluble form that may be shed from cell membranes. Cell surface&#x02013;bound CD138 impairs invasion of myeloma cells through collagen gels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Liebersbach and Sanderson, 1994</xref>), facilitates cell&#x02013;cell aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Stanley et al., 1995</xref>), and promotes myeloma adhesion to collagen in the extracellular matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ridley et al., 1993</xref>). These functions have been hypothesized to explain the organ selectivity of myeloma cells, and CD138 is being investigated as a potential therapeutic target in myeloma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sanderson and Yang, 2008</xref>).</p><p>The role of CD138 in normal PCs, however, is less well defined, although it may have similar bone marrow homing functions in PCs as in myeloma cells. CD138 is expressed on the cell surface of PCs and bone marrow&#x02013;resident B cell precursors. It is not present on the surface of mature naive B cells in the bone marrow, circulation, or secondary lymphoid organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sanderson et al., 1989</xref>). CD138 expression has been closely correlated with Ig secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lalor et al., 1992</xref>), and CD138<sup>+</sup> plasmablasts have been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Angelin-Duclos et al., 2000</xref>), but the existence of a non&#x02013;Ig-secreting CD138<sup>+</sup> cell population has not been formally demonstrated until now. The converse has been seen, however, in that Blimp1-deficient B cells do not express CD138 but can secrete small amounts of Ig (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Shapiro-Shelef et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kallies et al., 2007</xref>). However, this represents an earlier (initial) developmental stage of PC differentiation in that these cells are unable to attain the large secretory capabilities or phenotype of mature PCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kallies et al., 2007</xref>). IRF4-deficient B cells also fail to express CD138 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Klein et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Our findings therefore indicate that in developing PCs, Blimp1 and IRF4 expression precedes CD138 expression, which is then followed by XBP1-directed UPR transcriptional events and large-scale immunoglobulin secretion. This differs from our previously published results in which CD138 was not detected on the surface of XBP1-deficient B cells 9 d after immunization with 2,4-dinitrophenyl (DNP)-albumin in XBP1/RAG2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> lymphoid chimeric mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Reimold et al., 2001</xref>). One limitation of the XBP1/RAG2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> lymphoid chimeric model, however, is that it cannot ascribe this difference solely to an intrinsic deficiency of XBP1 in B cells. With the recent discovery that XBP1 is important for the normal development and function of dendritic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Iwakoshi et al., 2007</xref>), one could conjecture that XBP1 function in non&#x02013;B cell populations might in part explain the reduced numbers of CD138<sup>+</sup> cells in the chimeric mice. Thus, the XBP1<sup>CD19</sup> cKO system provides some refinement in our understanding of the relationship between XBP1 and CD138 expression.</p></sec><sec><title>Post-GC memory cells and preplasma memory cells are intact in mice with B cells that lack XBP1</title><p>Memory B cells make up the second major population of terminally differentiated B cells (for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">McHeyzer-Williams and McHeyzer-Williams, 2005</xref>). They are long-lived antigen-specific cells that reside mainly in peripheral tissues, including in the lung, gut, and peripheral lymphoid organs. When reexposed to cognate antigen, memory B cells proliferate, and a subset differentiates into antibody-secreting PCs. Memory B cell subpopulations can be distinguished phenotypically as post-GC B cells (B220<sup>+</sup> CD138<sup>&#x02212;</sup>) or preplasma memory B cells (B220<sup>&#x02212;</sup> CD79b<sup>+</sup> CD138<sup>&#x02212;</sup>; for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">McHeyzer-Williams and McHeyzer-Williams, 2005</xref>).</p><p>Little is known about the transcriptional programs that regulate B cell differentiation into memory cells, including whether there is any role for XBP1 or the UPR in this process. Neither Blimp1 nor IRF4 are required for the development of post-GC memory B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Shapiro-Shelef et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Klein et al., 2006</xref>). Blimp1-deficient B cells, however, fail to differentiate into preplasma memory B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Shapiro-Shelef et al., 2003</xref>). Furthermore, IRF4-deficient post-GC B cells can expand upon reencounter with cognate antigen (a memory cell&#x02013;driven response), but they fail to differentiate into PCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Klein et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, neither of these transcription factors appears to be crucial for development of the memory B cell population de novo.</p><p>We have already demonstrated that secondary Ig responses are markedly blunted in XBP1<sup>CD19</sup> mice (Fig. S2). Using a well established protocol to study memory B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Shapiro-Shelef et al., 2003</xref>), we next sought to answer whether the defect in secondary memory responses in XBP1<sup>CD19</sup> mice is solely attributable to impaired antibody secretion by PCs or whether there may also be independent deficiencies in memory B cell populations themselves. Mice were immunized with 400 &#x000b5;g NP-KLH in Ribi adjuvant and splenocytes were isolated at day 5 or 14. Cells were stained with antibodies specific for CD4, CD8, F4/80 (a macrophage marker), GR1 (a granulocyte and monocyte marker), B220 (CD45R), CD138, IgD, GL7, CD38, and Ig &#x003bb; light chain. In addition, cells were stained with propidium iodide (PI) to determine viability and allophycocyanin (APC)-conjugated NP to identify antigen-specific B cells. Viable post-GC NP-specific B cells were identified as those cells that excluded PI, were [CD4, CD8, F4/80, GR1]<sup>neg</sup>, and demonstrated a NP<sup>+</sup>IgD<sup>lo</sup> phenotype. The expansion of these cells after immunization was comparable between XBP1<sup>CD19</sup> and XBP1<sup>+/+</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref>).</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><p><bold>Memory B cells are present in normal numbers in XBP1<sup>CD19</sup> mice.</bold> (A, left) Representative expression of IgD and NP on [PI, CD4, CD8, F4/80, GR1]<sup>neg</sup> splenocytes of day-14 mice immunized with Ribi (adjuvant) only (left) or NP-KLH in Ribi (right).

At day 14, there were some differences in the relative numbers of these cells, but the absolute numbers were not significantly different because the number of splenocytes and absolute number of NP-specific cells were up to twofold greater in XBP1<sup>CD19</sup> mice.

There were also no differences between XBP1<sup>CD19</sup> and XBP1<sup>+/+</sup> mice when assayed for the repertoire of &#x003bb; light chain expression by antigen-specific B cells (Fig. S4 B). ELISPOT was used to measure the ability of FACS-purified B220<sup>int</sup> CD138<sup>+</sup> cells to secrete IgM and IgG. At days 5 and 14, the number of NP-specific IgG-secreting B cells was significantly reduced in XBP1<sup>CD19</sup> mice as compared with controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 C</xref>). Similar results were obtained for NP-specific IgM-secreting cells at day 5 but not at day 14. These assays reinforce the notion that XBP1<sup>CD19</sup> B cells are able to differentiate into B220<sup>int</sup> CD138<sup>+</sup> cells but lack the normal capacity for Ig secretion.</p><p>Thus, XBP1<sup>CD19</sup> B cells are capable of differentiating normally into post-GC or preplasma memory B cell populations. These observations again place XBP1-mediated events downstream of Blimp1, which is crucial for the development of preplasma memory B cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Shapiro-Shelef et al., 2003</xref>). These data also show for the first time that the XBP1-driven branch of the UPR is unnecessary for the development of memory B cells themselves. Thus, the defects in Ig production during secondary antigen challenge in XBP1<sup>CD19</sup> mice are solely the result of a failure of formation of antibody-secreting PCs and not of B cell memory itself.</p></sec><sec><title>Summary</title><p>Collectively, this analysis of B cells from XBP1<sup>CD19</sup> cKO mice expands our understanding of the crucial role of XBP1 in terminal B cell development as it pertains to PC development, autoantibody-mediated autoimmune disease, and memory cell development. Deletion of XBP1 leads to failed up-regulation of the UPR in developing PCs with subsequent deficiencies in antibody responses to antigen. Interestingly, the experiments presented here identify and characterize a previously unrecognized population of antibody hyposecreting B220<sup>int</sup> CD138<sup>+</sup> B cells in XBP1<sup>CD19</sup> mice, demonstrating that XBP1-mediated UPR events occur after the developmental stage at which CD138 is expressed. Importantly, we establish that memory B cell populations are unaffected by XBP1 deficiency such that XBP1-related activity can be situated independent of the memory B cell lineage commitment. Finally, XBP1<sup>CD19</sup> mice are protected from autoantibody-mediated mouse lupus. This has therapeutic implications from a clinical perspective in that inhibition of XBP1 or the UPR in general potentially represents a therapeutic target in the treatment of SLE.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title/><sec><title>Mice and immunization.</title><p>The creation of XBP1<sup>flox</sup> mice harboring loxP sites in the first and second intron of the XBP1 gene has been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hetz et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kaser et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lee et al., 2008</xref>).
