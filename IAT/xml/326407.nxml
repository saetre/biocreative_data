These genes are expressed in cultured mouse cells and the 3' and 5' ends of the mRNA have been determined by S1 nuclease mapping. These genes code for a minor fraction of the histone mRNAs expressed in cultured mouse cells. They comprise at most 5-8% of the total histone mRNA of each type. The two H3 genes code for H3.2 and H3.1 histone proteins, while the H2b gene codes for an H2b.1 protein with a single amino acid change (val-leu) at position 18. Only the 3' portion of the H2a gene is contained in the clone and there is an amino acid change (alanine-proline) at position 126. Comparison of the 5' and 3' flanking sequences reveals a conserved sequence at the 3' end of the mRNA which forms a hairpin loop structure. The codon usage in the genes is non-random and there has been no discrimination against CG doublets in the coding region of the genes.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00364-0108-a" xlink:role="6686"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00364-0110-a" xlink:role="6688"/></fig><fig id="F3"><graphic xlink:href="nar00364-0112-a" xlink:role="6690"/></fig><fig id="F4"><graphic xlink:href="nar00364-0113-a" xlink:role="6691"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00364-0101.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6679"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00364-0102.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6680"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00364-0103.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6681"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00364-0104.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6682"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00364-0105.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6683"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00364-0106.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6684"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00364-0107.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6685"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00364-0108.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6686"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00364-0109.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6687"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00364-0110.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6688"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00364-0111.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6689"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00364-0112.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6690"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00364-0113.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6691"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00364-0114.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6692"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00364-0115.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6693"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00364-0116.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6694"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00364-0117.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6695"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00364-0118.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6696"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00364-0119.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="6697"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
