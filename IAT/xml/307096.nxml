This family also includes many proteins with no known function. To better characterize this family of proteins we have used molecular phylogenetic techniques to infer evolutionary relationships among the family members. We have divided the SNF2 family into multiple subfamilies, each of which represents what we propose to be a functionally and evolutionarily distinct group. We have then used the subfamily structure to predict the functions of some of the uncharacterized proteins in the SNF2 family. We discuss possible implications of this evolutionary analysis on the general properties and evolution of the SNF2 family.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00014-0155-a" xlink:role="2717"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00014-0157-a" xlink:role="2719"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00014-0153.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2715"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00014-0154.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2716"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00014-0155.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2717"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00014-0156.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2718"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00014-0157.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2719"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00014-0158.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2720"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00014-0159.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2721"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00014-0160.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2722"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00014-0161.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="2723"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
