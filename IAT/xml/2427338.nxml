In this study we found an inverse correlation between EZH2 and <italic>RUNX3</italic> gene expression in five cancer cell lines, <italic>i.e.</italic> gastric, breast, prostate, colon, and pancreatic cancer cell lines. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assay showed an association between EZH2 bound to the <italic>RUNX3</italic> gene promoter, and trimethylated histone H3 at lysine 27, and HDAC1 (histone deacetylase 1) bound to the <italic>RUNX3</italic> gene promoter in cancer cells. RNA interference-mediated knockdown of EZH2 resulted in a decrease in H3K27 trimethylation and unbound HDAC1 and an increase in expression of the <italic>RUNX3</italic> gene. Restoration of <italic>RUNX3</italic> expression was not associated with any change in DNA methylation status in the <italic>RUNX3</italic> promoter region. <italic>RUNX3</italic> was repressed by histone deacetylation and hypermethylation of a CpG island in the promoter region and restored by trichostatin A or/and 5-aza-2&#x02032;-deoxycytidine. Immunofluorescence staining confirmed restoration of expression of the RUNX3 protein after knockdown of EZH2 and its restoration resulted in decreased cell proliferation. <italic>In vivo</italic>, an inverse relationship between expression of the EZH2 and RUNX3 proteins was observed at the individual cell level in gastric cancer patients in the absence of DNA methylation in the <italic>RUNX3</italic> promoter region. The results showed that <italic>RUNX3</italic> is a target for repression by EZH2 and indicated an underlying mechanism of the functional role of EZH2 overexpression on cancer cell proliferation.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><label>*</label><p>This work was supported by <grant-sponsor>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology, Japan</grant-sponsor>, Grant <grant-num>19590417</grant-num> (to S.

All <italic>RUNX</italic> family members share the central Runt domain, which is well conserved and recognizes a specific DNA sequence, but each has relatively divergent N- and C-terminal regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>). RUNX3 is involved in neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>) and thymopoiesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>) and functions as a tumor suppressor gene in gastric cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>). Failure to express RUNX3 because of a combination of hemizygous deletion and DNA hypermethylation of the <italic>RUNX3</italic> promoter region has been found in about 60% of primary gastric cancer specimens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>). RUNX3-R122C is a mutation located in the conserved Runt domain that was discovered in a case of gastric cancer and it abolishes the tumor suppressive activity of <italic>RUNX3</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>). Subsequent studies have revealed that <italic>RUNX3</italic> inactivation is not limited to gastric cancer, and frequent inactivation of <italic>RUNX3</italic> due to DNA hypermethylation has been reported in various other cancers, including lung cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>), hepatocellular carcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>), breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>), colon cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>), pancreatic cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>), bile duct cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>), prostate cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>), and laryngeal cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>). Thus, <italic>RUNX3</italic> is primarily inactivated by epigenetic silencing, rather than by mutations or deletions, suggesting that <italic>RUNX3</italic> can be reactivated and serve as a good gene for drug targeting.</p><p>Enhancer of zeste homologue 2 (EZH2)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3">2</xref> is one of the polycomb group proteins involved in the regulation of proliferation and cell cycle progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>). More specifically, EZH2 is a histone methyltransferase controlled by the E2F transcription factors that regulate the transition from G<sub>2</sub> to the mitotic phase of the cell cycle through nucleosome modification, chromatin remodeling, and interaction with other transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>). Disruption of EZH2 expression in senescent fibroblasts retards cell proliferation and induces cell cycle arrest at the G<sub>2</sub> to mitosis transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>), whereas overexpression of EZH2 in cultured mouse embryonic fibroblasts shortens the G<sub>1</sub> phase of the cell cycle and leads to accumulation of cells in the S phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>). EZH2 expression has been found to be linked to the progression of prostate and breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>), and because it is a biomarker of tumor progression, <italic>EZH2</italic> has also been suggested to be an oncogene that leads to tumor development. EZH2 competes with histone deacetylase in binding to retinoblastoma protein 2/p130 and subsequently reduces the transcriptional repression of the <italic>CyclinA</italic> promoter, suggesting a molecular mechanism linking elevated EZH2 expression to malignant transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>). However, the downstream signaling and molecular mechanism for the aberrant expression of EZH2 in cancer has been poorly understood.</p><p>RUNX3 has been found to up-regulate <italic>p21</italic><sup>WAF1/Cip1</sup>, an important factor in cyclin-dependent kinase inhibition and cell cycle control, and has been found to do so in collaboration with Smads downstream of transforming growth factor-&#x003b2; in gastric cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>). <italic>RUNX3</italic> is also responsible for transcriptional up-regulation of <italic>Bim</italic> in transforming growth factor-&#x003b2;-induced apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>). Thus, <italic>RUNX3</italic> plays a critical role in the induction of apoptosis as well as in the regulation of cell growth arrest, suggesting that <italic>RUNX3</italic> is a significant tumor suppressor gene in carcinogenesis. In the present study, we investigated the mechanism of the role that EZH2 plays in cancer cell proliferation in several different cancer cell lines and found that EZH2 is a transcriptional repressor of <italic>RUNX3</italic> expression and acts synergistically with DNA methylation.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><p><italic>Cell Culture</italic>&#x02014;Five human cancer cell lines, <italic>i.e.</italic> gastric cancer cell line MKN28, breast cancer cell line MCF-7, prostate cancer cell line LNCap, colon cancer cell line DLD1, and pancreatic cancer cell line MiaPaca2, were maintained at 37 &#x000b0;C in RPMI 1640 or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 1% glutamine in a 5% CO<sub>2</sub> atmosphere.</p><p><italic>Tissue Specimens</italic>&#x02014;A total of 17 gastric cancer specimens (stage IA, 3; IB, 4; II, 2; IIIA, 3; IIIB, 2; and IV, 3; 8 intestinal-type adenocarcinomas and 9 diffuse-type adenocarcinomas) and corresponding non-neoplastic gastric mucosa were studied. The specimens were obtained from 8 males and 9 females (mean age 62.8 years; range 52&#x02013;77 years) by surgical resection at the National Cancer Hospital East and were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 &#x000b0;C until examined. The histological diagnosis was confirmed by microscopic analysis of a section of each frozen specimen before DNA extraction. None of the patients had any preoperative treatment, such as radiation or chemotherapy. All patients agreed to enrollment in the study and gave their informed consent. The institutional review board of the National Cancer Center approved all protocols after obtaining the patients' consent. All clinicopathological data were according to the TNM classification (UICC) and obtained from the clinical and pathology records.</p><p><italic>RNA Interference</italic>&#x02014;Two different 21-nucleotides duplex siRNAs for EZH2 and one negative control siRNA were synthesized by Ambion (EZH2; siRNA ID 107417 and 214022). Twenty-four hours after plating, the cells were transfected with EZH2 siRNA or control siRNA using the DharmaFECT transfection reagent (DHARMACON) according to the manufacturer's instructions. At various time points after transfection, cells were harvested and subjected to several assays, including real-time PCR and Western blotting analysis.</p><p><italic>RNA Isolation and Real-time RT-PCR</italic>&#x02014;Total RNA from the five different cell lines was isolated with TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen) and reverse transcribed to cDNA with ExScript RT Reagent (Takara). Real-time RT-PCR was carried out with specific primers for <italic>EZH2</italic> and <italic>RUNX3</italic> and Smart Cycler (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA). <italic>GAPDH</italic> expression was used to normalize for variance. Real-time fluorescence monitoring of the PCR products was performed with SYBR Green I fluorescent dye (Takara). The expression levels of specific genes are reported as ratios of expression of <italic>GAPDH</italic> in the same master reaction. The PCR primer pairs (5&#x02032; to 3&#x02032;) used for each gene were: <italic>EZH2</italic>, CCCTGACCTCTGTCTTACTTGTGGA and ACGTCAGATGGTGCCAGCAATA; <italic>RUNX3</italic>, TCTGTAAGGCCCAAAGTGGGTA and ACCTCAGCATGACAATATGTCACAA; <italic>GAPDH</italic>, GCACCGTCAAGGCTGAGAAC and ATGGTGGTGAAGACGCCAGT.</p><p><italic>Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) Assay</italic>&#x02014;The ChIP assay was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>). The PCR conditions for the <italic>RUNX3</italic> gene promoter were applied with the following two primer pairs (5&#x02032; to 3&#x02032;): ChIP primer 1, TGTCCCGGGATCCTCTTCT and TAGAGACGTTGGTGCGGAAAT and ChIP primer 2, CTCTCTGCTCTCCCCTCAAAAC and GGACCGTGGTTACATGCGTAA. These primer sets were designed to encompass the transcriptional start site of <italic>RUNX3</italic> variant 2 in the CpG island. A 5 &#x003bc;g amount of each antibody was used in this assay. The antibodies used were EZH2 antibody and dimethyl H3 (Lys<sup>9</sup>) antibody, purchased from Abcam Inc., and HDAC1 antibody and trimethyl H3 (Lys<sup>27</sup>) antibody, purchased from Upstate. Individual ChIP assays were repeated at least twice to confirm the reproducibility of the PCR-based experiment. Preliminary PCR were performed to determine the optimal PCR conditions to assure linear amplification of DNA. PCR products were electrophoresed on a 6% polyacrylamide gel, stained with ethidium bromide, and photographed. To measure the levels of EZH2, HDAC1, and histone methylation (K9 and K27) in each immunoprecipitate, the ratios were calculated by measuring the intensity of the PCR product in immunoprecipitated DNA <italic>versus</italic> input DNA (total chromatin) amplified by PCR in a linear range. The ratios were calculated by performing a DNA 1000 assay with the Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer and using DNA chips for electrophoresis (Agilent Technologies). The <italic>MYT1</italic> (myelin transcription factor 1) gene was used as a positive control to validate each ChIP assay.

Briefly, 2 &#x003bc;l of bisulfite-treated DNA was used as the PCR template, and primer sets specific for methylated and unmethylated alleles were used. The MSP primers for <italic>RUNX3</italic> used in this study have been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>).

The ChIP assay revealed EZH2 binding to the <italic>RUNX3</italic> promoter region in the control MKN28 and MCF-7 cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>A</italic></xref><italic>, a</italic> and <italic>b</italic>), and the amount of the EZH2 recruited to the promoter region of <italic>RUNX3</italic> was inversely correlated with the RUNX3 mRNA expression levels in both cell lines. The level of H3-Lys<sup>27</sup> trimethylation in the <italic>RUNX3</italic> promoter was significantly reduced in MKN28 and MCF-7 cells transfected with EZH2 siRNA, and the decrease in H3-Lys<sup>27</sup> trimethylation was inversely correlated with the increase in expression of the <italic>RUNX3</italic> gene. The amount of HDAC1 bound to the <italic>RUNX3</italic> promoter was also significantly reduced in MKN28 and MCF-7 cells transfected with EZH2 siRNA, and the decrease in HDAC1 was inversely correlated with an increase in expression of the <italic>RUNX3</italic> gene, suggesting that EZH2 forms a transcriptional repressive complex with HDAC1. A decreased level of H3-Lys<sup>9</sup> dimethylation was also detected in MKN28 cells transfected with EZH2 siRNA in comparison with MKN28 cells transfected with control siRNA, suggesting that H3-Lys<sup>9</sup> status may also be involved in modulation of the <italic>RUNX3</italic> gene promoter activity by EZH2. Based on all of the above findings, we concluded that <italic>RUNX3</italic> gene silencing in cancer cells is mediated by EZH2 increasing the H3-Lys<sup>27</sup> methylation level. <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>A</italic></xref><italic>, c</italic>, shows that the binding levels of EZH2 and H3K27me3 (H3-Lys<sup>27</sup> trimethylation) in the <italic>MYT1</italic> promoter region, which is known to be a target of EZH2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>), clearly decreased after knockdown of EZH2, suggesting the ChIP assay was valid. The means and standard deviations of ChIP experiments for each antibody were shown as diagrams (supplemental Fig. S1).</p><p><fig position="float" id="fig3"><label>FIGURE 3.</label><caption><p><bold>Restoration of <italic>RUNX3</italic> expression in five cancer cell lines after treatment with 5-aza-dC, TSA, or a combination of 5-aza-dC and TSA.</bold><italic>RUNX3</italic> expression in the five lines was evaluated by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. <italic>A</italic>, MKN28; <italic>B</italic>, MCF-7; <italic>C</italic>, LNCap; <italic>D</italic>, DLD1, and <italic>E</italic>, MiaPaca2.

We then investigated whether the status of DNA methylation in the <italic>RUNX3</italic> promoter region changed after knockdown of EZH2 and resulted in restoration of <italic>RUNX3</italic> gene expression. Although <italic>RUNX3</italic> was up-regulated after EZH2 siRNA transfection, as shown in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>B</italic></xref> the MSP analysis showed no decrease in DNA methylation of the <italic>RUNX3</italic> promoter region. Hypermethylation of the promoter of the <italic>RUNX3</italic> gene occurred before and after EZH2 siRNA transfection in all five cancer cell lines examined. DNA hypermethylation in the promoter region is known to be associated with silencing of the <italic>RUNX3</italic> gene, however, the above findings suggest that histone modification by EZH2 also played an important role in the regulation of <italic>RUNX3</italic> in all five cancer cell lines.</p><p><italic>Cell Treatment with TSA and 5-Aza-dC</italic>&#x02014;To determine the relative contribution of DNA methylation and histone deacetylation to <italic>RUNX3</italic> silencing, we investigated the effect of a demethylating agent, 5-aza-2&#x02032;-deoxycytidine (5-aza-dC), and a histone deacetylase inhibitor, TSA, in all five cancer cell lines. Real-time RT-PCR showed that exposure to 5-aza-dC resulted in less restoration of <italic>RUNX3</italic> expression than exposure to TSA in four of the cancer cell lines, the exception being the MiaPaca2 line (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, <italic>A&#x02013;E</italic></xref>), but MSP analysis showed hypermethylation of CpG in all five cancer cell lines (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>B</italic></xref>). Although the histone deacetylase inhibitor TSA alone was sufficient to strongly restore <italic>RUNX3</italic> expression (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, <italic>A&#x02013;E</italic></xref>), the combination of DNA demethylation and inhibition of histone deacetylation restored <italic>RUNX3</italic> expression synergistically (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, <italic>A&#x02013;E</italic></xref>). In other words, the effect of histone deacetylation on <italic>RUNX3</italic> transcriptional repression was greater than that of DNA methylation, except in cell line MiaPaca2. Thus, both histone deacetylation and DNA methylation play a synergistic role in silencing <italic>RUNX3</italic> expression. Neither 5-aza-dC nor TSA changed the EZH2 expression levels in any of the cancer cell lines (data not shown). As stated above, the ChIP assay showed that down-regulation of EZH2 by siRNA transfection reversed the binding of HDAC1 to the promoter region of <italic>RUNX3</italic>, which is restoration of <italic>RUNX3</italic> expression. These findings could explain why knockdown of EZH2 by siRNA transfection was capable of restoring <italic>RUNX3</italic> expression.</p><p><italic>Knockdown of EZH2-induced RUNX3 Protein Expression in Gastric Cancer Cells</italic>&#x02014;To determine whether EZH2 down-regulates the RUNX3 protein, we used immunofluorescence to investigate whether a decrease in the EZH2 protein level would restore RUNX3 protein expression. A Western blot analysis in the MKN28 cells following knockdown of EZH2 by siRNA transfection showed that RUNX3 protein was significantly up-regulated (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>A</italic></xref>). Immunofluorescence staining confirmed that expression of the RUNX3 protein had been restored in both the nucleus and cytoplasm (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>B</italic></xref>), and this finding demonstrated that EZH2 overexpression down-regulates RUNX3 protein in cancer cells.</p><p><fig position="float" id="fig4"><label>FIGURE 4.</label><caption><p><bold>Knockdown of EZH2-restored <italic>RUNX3</italic> expression and decreased cell proliferation by the cancer cell lines.</bold><italic>A</italic>, RUNX3 re-expression in MKN28 cells was detected by Western blot analysis at 96 h after EZH2 knockdown. <italic>B</italic>, the nuclear and cytoplasmic distribution of RUNX3 was restored in MKN28 cells transfected with EZH2 siRNA (EZH2, <italic>green</italic>; RUNX3, <italic>red</italic>).

Loss of RUNX3 is thought to play a critical role in the process of tumor cell proliferation, and because EZH2 down-regulates <italic>RUNX3</italic> expression, we investigated the effect of EZH2 on cell proliferation by testing the growth inhibitory effect of EZH2 siRNA in all five cancer cell lines, gastric cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer, colon cancer, and pancreatic cancer lines. At 48 h after transfection with EZH2 siRNA or control siRNA, cells were re-seeded in new plates and observed for cell growth. As shown in <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>C</italic></xref>, cell growth started 24 h after re-seeding (72 h after transfection), and there was significantly less cell growth by the EZH2 siRNA-treated cells than by the control cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4<italic>C</italic></xref>) (<italic>t</italic> test) (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05).</p><p><italic>EZH2 Overexpression Also Correlated with Loss of RUNX3 in Gastric Adenocarcinoma Tissue</italic>&#x02014;Because EZH2 overexpression correlated with loss of <italic>RUNX3</italic> expression in all five cancer cell lines examined in this study and HDAC1-mediated histone modification by EZH2 acted synergistically with DNA methylation in the promoter region to silence <italic>RUNX3</italic> expression, we investigated cancer tissue specimens for such a correlation to determine whether this repressive synergism would silence <italic>RUNX3</italic> expression in a clinicopathologically relevant context (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, <italic>A&#x02013;C</italic></xref>). To determine whether the <italic>RUNX3</italic> silencing pathway by EZH2 exists <italic>in vivo</italic>, immunohistochemical staining was used to examine 17 gastric adenocarcinomas and adjacent non-cancerous gastric mucosa for DNA methylation in the <italic>RUNX3</italic> promoter, overexpression of EZH2 protein, and RUNX3 expression. To test for DNA methylation and/or histone modification by EZH overexpression, we investigated individual cases with gastric cancer <italic>in vivo</italic>. The patients' profiles and clinicopathological data are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>. The MSP analysis showed DNA hypermethylation in 64.7% (11/17) of the gastric adenocarcinomas (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>A</italic></xref>). Immunohistochemical staining showed a slight difference in the distribution of RUNX3-positive cells in the fundic gland and pyloric gland portions. In the fundic gland portion, RUNX3-positive cells were observed mainly in a deeper zone of the fundic glands, corresponding to chief cells morphologically. A slight amount of RUNX3 protein was also detected in the surface epithelial cells in the gastric pits. In the pyloric gland portion, scattered RUNX3-positive cells were observed in the lower half of the antral mucosa near the generative zone. In contrast to the surrounding non-cancerous epithelial cells, weak to moderate cytoplasmic and/or nuclear positivity was observed in the gastric cancer cells in some of the specimens (5/17, 29.4%). EZH2 is normally expressed in the neck region of the gastric foveolae, which is the proliferative zone for gastric mucosa (data not shown) and in the germinal center follicular lymphocytes (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>B</italic></xref><italic>, center</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>). The percentage of specimens that showed overexpression of EZH2 (described as &#x0201c;positive&#x0201d; in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) according to the results of immunohistochemical staining was 82.3% (14/17). Interestingly, all (case numbers 13, 15, and 17) of three specimens with DNA methylation in the promoter of <italic>RUNX3</italic> and negativity for EZH2 overexpression showed RUNX3 expression (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>B</italic></xref>). On the other hand, four (case numbers 2, 5, 6, and 8) of five specimens without both RUNX3 expression and DNA methylation in the promoter of <italic>RUNX3</italic> showed EZH2 overexpression (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5<italic>C</italic></xref>). Even in some specimens without DNA hypermethylation of the <italic>RUNX3</italic> gene, RUNX3 protein expression was lost when EZH2 was overexpressed. This suggests that the loss of RUNX3 expression is mediated by histone methylation at Lys<sup>27</sup> by EZH2 overexpression <italic>in vivo</italic>. Moreover, no DNA methylation or EZH2 overexpression was observed in one specimen (case number 15) showed RUNX3 expression. These results seem to mean that the effects on RUNX3 expression described above are not limited to cultured cells but occur <italic>in</italic><italic>vivo</italic> as well. However, RUNX3 expression was detected in one specimen (case number 7) despite the presence of both DNA methylation and EZH2 overexpression. This finding seems to suggest the existence of an unknown mechanism of RUNX3 repression and further study will be necessary.</p><p><table-wrap position="float" id="tbl1"><label>TABLE

The mechanism underlying EZH2 overexpression associated with poor prognosis and the target genes down-regulated by EZH2, which lead to oncogenic activity, are still unknown. The mechanism of regulation of <italic>RUNX3</italic> by EZH2 reported above may shed some light on the mechanism underlying EZH2 overexpression.</p><p>Polycomb target genes are often silenced by histone deacetylation and DNA methylation of CpG islands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>), and this is explained by the ability of PcG proteins to bind histone deacetylases and recruit DNA methyltransferases. We used TSA, a cell permeable inhibitor of histone deacetylases, to investigate whether expression of the <italic>RUNX3</italic> gene is also controlled by histone deacetylation, and exposure of the five cancer cell lines to TSA for 48 h actually resulted in a 2.5&#x02013;26.2-fold increase in the RUNX3 transcript level (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, <italic>A&#x02013;E</italic></xref>). Because TSA did not affect the expression level of EZH2, these findings strongly indicate that the <italic>RUNX3</italic> gene is also silenced by histone deacetylation. To test in detail, we performed ChIP experiments with antibodies against HDAC1. After transfection with control siRNA, both regions of the <italic>RUNX3</italic> promoter examined were bound to HDAC1 in the MKN28 and MCF-7 cell lines (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>A</italic></xref>), both of whose Runx3 transcript levels were restored only by TSA treatment for 48 h. By contrast, after transfection of these two cancer cell lines with EZH2 siRNA, less HDAC1 was bound to both regions of the <italic>RUNX3</italic> promoter examined when <italic>RUNX3</italic> expression was restored (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2<italic>A</italic></xref>). This suggests that down-regulation of <italic>RUNX3</italic> may be mediated by both H3K27 trimethylation by EZH2 and histone deacetylation by HDAC1. A previous study also showed restoration of both RUNX3 transcript and RUNX3 protein levels in breast cancer cell lines including MCF-7, T47D, and MDA-MB-231 by TSA alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27">27</xref>). Moreover, the results of our study showed that EZH2 and HDAC1 act synergistically to down-regulate <italic>RUNX3</italic> expression.</p><p>Hypermethylation of <italic>RUNX3</italic> had been found to be common in many types of cancer cell lines and to correlate with loss of RUNX3 expression, and in the present study we found that 5-aza-dC, an inhibitor of DNA methyltransferase, promoted expression of the <italic>RUNX3</italic> gene in five cancer cell lines by 1.5&#x02013;10.9-fold (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, <italic>A&#x02013;E</italic></xref>), indicating that DNA methylation also contributed to the repression of <italic>RUNX3</italic>. A comparison between DNA methylation and HDAC1 binding (histone deacetylation) to determine which was more effective in repressing <italic>RUNX3</italic> showed that the level of RUNX3 transcript restoration by TSA was much greater than by 5-aza-dC in four of the cancer cell lines, the exception being the MiaPaca2 line (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, <italic>A&#x02013;E</italic></xref>). In our study, EZH2 knockdown by transient siRNA transfection restored the RUNX3 transcript level 3.5&#x02013;10.4-fold without any change in the DNA methylation status of the <italic>RUNX3</italic> promoter region (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref>). This finding indicates that histone modification by EZH2 plays a key role in down-regulation of <italic>RUNX3</italic>, in addition to DNA methylation in the promoter.</p><p>EZH2 expression has been proposed as a marker of invasion and aggressive tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>), and experimental data have indicated a role of EZH2 in cell cycle regulation and proliferation. For example, disruption of EZH2 expression retards cell proliferation and induces cell cycle arrest at the G<sub>2</sub>-M transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>), and overexpression of EZH2 in cultured mouse embryonic fibroblasts has been found to shorten the G<sub>1</sub> phase of the cell cycle and lead to accumulation of cells in the S phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>). A significant association between EZH2 and tumor cell proliferation, as estimated in human tumor tissue by Ki-67 expression and mitotic count, was recently demonstrated in clinical specimens including specimens of cutaneous melanoma and cancers of the endometrium, prostate, and breast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>). By contrast, <italic>RUNX3</italic> up-regulates <italic>p21</italic><sup>WAF1/Cip1</sup>, an important factor in cyclin-dependent kinase inhibition and cell cycle control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>). It was suggested that down-regulation of <italic>RUNX3</italic> by EZH2 overexpression shown in the present study may be one pathway by which EZH2 affects tumor cell proliferation.</p><p>In summary, in this study, we showed that increased expression of EZH2 results in H3K27 trimethylation of the <italic>RUNX3</italic> gene, indicating that <italic>RUNX3</italic> is a novel EZH2 target gene. The identification of <italic>RUNX3</italic> as an EZH2 target gene can support an influence of EZH2 overexpression on increasing tumor cell proliferation. Our findings suggest that specific inhibitors of EZH2 may be useful in the treatment of several types of cancers because such inhibitors are expected to reverse the down-regulation of the tumor suppressor <italic>RUNX3</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplemental Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="M800224200_index.html"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="PMC_2" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplemental Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="M800224200v2_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="M800224200v2_1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Mai Okumoto for technical assistance.</p></ack><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><citation citation-type="journal">Ito, Y.
