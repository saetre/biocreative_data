Intriguingly, some of these guidance molecules are persistently expressed after axonal pathfinding and target recognition are completed. Although their function at these later stages is poorly understood, recent findings suggest a role for these proteins in regulating synaptic connections.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Here we demonstrate that semaphorin 5B (Sema5B) regulates the elimination of synaptic connections in cultured hippocampal neurons. We show that Sema5B is proteolytically processed in neonatal brains and primary hippocampal cultures, resulting in the secretion of Sema5B fragments that include the biologically active semaphorin domain. Overexpression of full-length Sema5B in hippocampal neurons reduces synapse number while expression of a Sema5B construct lacking the semaphorin domain has no effect. Moreover, bath application with the proteolytically processed, secreted fragments containing the semaphorin domain of Sema5B, results in a rapid elimination of synaptic connections as demonstrated by time-lapse imaging. Conversely, depletion of endogenous Sema5B using RNA interference results in a significant increase in synapse number as well as a significant increase in the size of presynaptic and postsynaptic compartments.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our results demonstrate that in addition to its role as a guidance cue, Sema5B regulates the development and maintenance of synapse size and number in hippocampal neurons. In addition, proteolytic cleavage of Sema5B results in the release of a potentially diffusible semaphorin domain that is a necessary component for its biological function in the regulation of synapse morphology.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The formation of synaptic connections between growing axons and their appropriate targets is essential for proper functioning of the nervous system. During development, synaptic networks are refined through the elimination of excessive or inappropriate synapses that have initially been formed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. In addition to these early refinement events, the assembly and disassembly of synapses persists into adulthood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. It has been suggested that this continuous modification of synaptic connections may serve as a cellular substrate for learning and memory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] however the molecular mechanisms regulating synapse formation and elimination remain largely unknown.</p><p>The semaphorins are a large family of guidance molecules that are involved in processes such as cell migration, axonal guidance, and axonal fasciculation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. While the majority of semaphorins act as inhibitory or repellent molecules, some semaphorins also function as permissive or attractive cues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Semaphorins typically confer their inhibitory activity through a conserved 500 amino acid 'sema' domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], while a variety of alternative functions are associated with their varied C-terminal domains.</p><p>Several members of the semaphorin family have recently been shown to affect the structure and function of central nervous system (CNS) synapses. The invertebrate transmembrane protein, Sema1A, is required for the formation of the giant fiber synapse in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, but overexpression of this protein results in synaptic destabilization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In mammals, bath application of the secreted semaphorins, Sema3A and Sema3F, decreases and increases, respectively, synaptic transmission in cultured hippocampal neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Signaling through the Sema3F receptor plexin A3 is also necessary for the elimination of inappropriate synaptic contacts between dentate gyrus mossy fibers and cornu ammonis (CA)3 pyramidal cells during normal hippocampal development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>The semaphorin Sema5B is expressed in a variety of regions in the developing brain including the hippocampus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Its persistent expression at postnatal stages suggests that Sema5B may contribute to the functioning of neuronal circuits and specifically to the regulation of synaptic functions. Sema5B is a transmembrane protein that, in addition to the typically inhibitory sema domain, possess seven thrombospondin repeats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. This is intriguing as thrombospondins are permissive for axon outgrowth and enhance synaptogenesis, suggesting a bifunctional role for Sema5B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Indeed, the Sema5B homologue, Sema5A, has previously been shown to function as a permissive or inhibitory cue to axon outgrowth depending on local matrix proteoglycans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Whether Sema5B may have similar bifunctional characteristics is unknown.</p><p>Here, we provide evidence that Sema5B is involved in synapse elimination in hippocampal neurons. Overexpression of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-Sema5B in hippocampal neurons results in a decrease in synapse number, however this effect is eliminated when the repulsive sema domain is removed. Accordingly, bath application of hippocampal neurons with secreted Sema5B fragments containing the sema domain resulted in the elimination of postsynaptic, postsynaptic density (PSD)-95 clusters. Conversely, depletion of endogenous Sema5B using short hairpin RNA (shRNA) resulted in the exuberant formation and/or maintenance of synaptic connections, with a concomitant increase in the size of pre and postsynaptic densities. These data therefore reveal a new role for semaphorins in regulating synapse maintenance and morphology and provide insights into the role that these guidance molecules may play in the developing brain.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Sema5B antibody</title><p>Antibodies were generated against the N-terminus of full length Sema5B (anti-5B) along a region that showed the least amino acid homology with other semaphorins including Sema5A (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>). This antibody recognized a hemaglutinin (HA)-tagged recombinant form of Sema5B at approximately 150 kDa (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>) but did not crossreact with a purified Sema5A (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1c</xref>). In contrast, a 150 kDa Sema5B band was absent in postnatal day 1 (P1) cortical or hippocampal lysates, but several smaller bands were apparent indicating that the majority of Sema5B is proteolytically processed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1d</xref>). Similar bands were observed in 21 days <italic>in vitro </italic>(DIV) and freshly cultured hippocampal neurons (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1d</xref>). The anti-5B antibody recognized a number of bands, all 110 KDa and smaller, indicating that the sema domain is proteolytically cleaved from the full length Sema5B and could potentially act as a diffusible molecule. As further validation of the specificity of the anti-5B antibody, the N-terminal peptide fragment was able to compete with the endogenous Sema5B epitopes (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, [Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>]), and there was a reduction of Sema5B immunolabeling in Sema5B knock down cells [Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Sema5B antibody specificity</bold>. <bold>(a) </bold>Schematic illustration of Sema5B including the region in the N-terminus used to generate the antibody.

To confirm this expression, postnatal day 1 (P1) and adult brain sections were immunolabeled for Sema5B (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a&#x02013;i</xref>). Sema5B was robustly expressed in the CA1-CA3 pyramidal cell layer as well as the dentate gyrus in both neonatal and adult mice (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a&#x02013;i</xref>). Sema5B was also localized to the stratum radiatum region immediately adjacent to the pyramidal cell layer. This reflected Sema5B localization in the neurites of CA1-CA3 cells, as well as Sema5B expression in interneurons (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b, d, g</xref>). Immunostaining in the stratum radiatum region appeared more robust in P1 mice compared to adults. This may reflect the dynamic nature of synapse formation and elimination at earlier versus later stages. Preadsorption with the peptide used in the generation of the Sema5B antibody resulted in reduced immunocytochemical labeling confirming the specificity of this antibody (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b, c</xref>; [Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>]).</p><p>The specificity of the 5B antibody was also demonstrated by immunolabeling hippocampal neurons transfected with full-length Sema5B fused to GFP (GFP-Sema5B). Indeed, Sema5B levels were markedly higher in GFP-Sema5B-expresing cells compared to surrounding, untransfected neurons, which expressed endogenous Sema5B (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a&#x02013;c</xref>). In untransfected cells, Sema5B exhibited a punctate distribution in the cell body and colocalized with both MAP-2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3d&#x02013;f</xref>) and tau (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3g&#x02013;i</xref>) indicating its localization in both dendrites and axons, respectively. Immunolabeling with the inhibitory marker glutamate decarboxylase (GAD)-65 revealed that both GAD-65-positive and GAD-65-negative cells express Sema5B. This indicates that Sema5B is expressed by both inhibitory and excitatory cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3j&#x02013;l</xref>). As the punctate distribution along the neurites was suggestive of a synaptic distribution, cells were also labeled with antibodies against the excitatory postsynaptic marker, PSD-95 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3m&#x02013;o</xref>) and the presynaptic marker, synaptophysin (data not shown). There did not appear to be an enrichment of Sema5B at synaptic compartments although there was some minimal colocalization observed between Sema5B and PSD-95 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3o</xref>, inset). Finally, Sema5B expression was also observed in glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP)-positive glial cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3p&#x02013;q</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Sema5B expression in hippocampal neurons</bold>. <bold>(a-r) </bold>Confocal images of 7 to 10 days <italic>in vitro </italic>(DIV) hippocampal cultures immunolabeled with anti-5B antibody plus the specified marker.

Immunolabeling with GFP antibodies of non-permeabilized human embryonic kidney (HEK)293 cells expressing GFP-Sema5B showed that it was appropriately targeted to the cell membrane (data not shown). To examine the effects of GFP-Sema5B overexpression on synapses, neurons were cotransfected with the excitatory postsynaptic marker PSD-95 fused to red fluorescent protein (RFP) to visualize postsynaptic densities. Cultures were then fixed and immunolabeled for synaptophysin, and synapses identified by the colocalization of the pre and postsynaptic markers synaptophysin and PSD-95-RFP, respectively (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4b, e, h</xref>).

This indicated that the number of synaptic inputs from wild type neurons onto the Sema5B overexpressing cell was significantly attenuated (see model, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>Overexpression of Sema5B reduces the number of synaptic inputs</bold>. <bold>(a-i) </bold>Confocal images of 13 days <italic>in vitro </italic>(DIV) hippocampal cultures cotransfected at 10 DIV with postsynaptic density (PSD)-95-RFP plus green fluorescent protein (GFP) (a), GFP-Sema5B (d), or GFP-&#x00394;sema (g), and immunolabeled for synaptophysin (b, e, h).

Our data suggests that similar processing of Sema5B occurs in the hippocampus (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1d</xref>). To further verify that hippocampal neurons can respond to Sema5B, neurons were cocultured with HEK293 cells transiently transfected with HA-Sema5B or a variety of truncated/deletion mutants. After 2 days in culture hippocampal neurites were observed to avoid contact with HEK293 cells expressing constructs that contained the sema domain (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6b</xref>, arrowheads), but grew robustly over control, untransfected HEK293 cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6b</xref>, arrows). While the majority of neurites avoid HEK293 cells expressing Sema5B, on occasion one or two neurites will contact and cross transfected cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6b</xref>; see also [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]). Nonetheless, the high degree of avoidance observed suggested that Sema5B is biologically active for hippocampal neurons. The most robust repulsion was observed when hippocampal neurons were cocultured with HEK293 cells that expressed a form of Sema5B that had the entire intracellular C-terminus removed (HA-Sema5B&#x00394;C) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6b</xref>). Although the avoidance of Sema5B&#x00394;C-expressing cells by hippocampal neurites could be due to contact mediated repulsion, the collapse of growth cones several microns away from the cells could be due to a short diffusible signal (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6b</xref>). To test this possibility, hippocampal neurons were bathed with concentrated supernatant from HEK293 cells expressing HA-Sema5B&#x00394;C. Bath application resulted in the collapse of neurites in a dose-dependent manner (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6d, e</xref>), whereas supernatant from untransfected cells had no impact on growth cone collapse (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6c</xref>). These observations indicate that hippocampal neurons are responsive to Sema5B and exhibit a collapsed/avoidance response similar to that observed with dorsal root ganglion neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In addition, these data indicate that the collapse and/or repulsion of processes are due to a biologically active fragment of Sema5B that is released into the media from the transfected HEK293 cells. To confirm the presence of a secreted form of Sema5B, the supernatant from cells expressing HA-Sema5B&#x00394;C was concentrated, run on an SDS-PAGE gel, and probed with an anti-HA antibody. A number of bands were observed between 100 and 130 kDa with one prominent band at approximately 130 kDa (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6a</xref>).

To determine the effect of supernatant treatment on synaptogenesis, 9 to 10 DIV hippocampal cultures were treated with supernatant from 293 cells expressing HA-Sema5B&#x00394;C (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7</xref>). Specifically, a quarter to a half of the concentration of supernatant that produced maximal growth cone collapse in the collapse assay was used for bath application. After bath application, a reduction in the number of synapses, identified by the colocalization of synaptophysin and PSD-95 puncta, was observed (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7g&#x02013;j</xref>). Increasing the supernatant decreased the percentage of PSD-95 puncta that had an associated Syn puncta twofold, from approximately 40% to 10% after 2 h (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7c, f, i, j</xref>). This effect did not appear to be secondary to collapse, as there were few examples of neurite collapse observed despite the loss of synaptic sites (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). To confirm these observations, experiments were repeated using time-lapse imaging. Neurons expressing GFP to visualize neurite morphology and PSD-95-RFP to visualize postsynaptic densities were treated with the supernatant of HA-Sema5B&#x00394;C-transfected HEK293 cells and imaged every 10 minutes for 60 to 90 minutes following bath application. At 1 h after treatment there was a 56% decrease in the number of PSD-95-RFP puncta (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). In control cells, only minimal fluctuations in the number of PSD-95 puncta were observed over time (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8g</xref>). These fluctuations may be attributed to biological changes in protein localization over time, or slight drifts in focal planes. Bleaching of fluorophores is unlikely as exposure times were short, and laser intensity minimal. The reduction of PSD-95 puncta in response to HA-Sema5B&#x00394;C bath application was not secondary to decreased cell viability, as no difference in survival was observed using the dye YO-PRO-1 as an early apoptotic marker, or using the highly sensitive colorimetric 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) cell viability assay (data not shown).</p><fig position="float" id="F7"><label>Figure 7</label><caption><p><bold>There is a decrease in synapse number in cells treated with secreted Sema5B</bold>. <bold>(a-i) </bold>Confocal images of 9 to 10 days <italic>in vitro </italic>(DIV) hippocampal neurons treated with supernatant from hemaglutinin (HA)-Sema5B&#x00394;C-expressing human embryonic kidney (HEK)293 cells and immunolabeled with anti-postsynaptic density (PSD)-95 (a-c) and anti-synaptophysin (d-f) antibodies.

One of the known caveats of shRNA is the 'off-target' effects, where unintended transcripts are silenced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. To minimize this possibility, two different shRNAs were used to reduce Sema5B protein levels. Previous reports have demonstrated a significant knockdown of Sema5B by Sema5B shRNA1 and Sema5B shRNA3 in heterologous cells and brain tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. We confirmed Sema5B knockdown in primary hippocampal neurons using immunocytochemistry (see [Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>]). To determine the effect of Sema5B knockdown on synapse number, neurons were cotransfected with PSD-95-RFP and cultures immunolabeled for synaptophysin (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9</xref>). Expression of both shRNA constructs resulted in a modest yet significant increase in the number of synapses as identified by PSD-95/synaptophysin colocalization (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9b, d, e</xref>), while the number of synapses in cells expressing control scrambled shRNA were similar to that of wild type neurons (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9a, c, e</xref>). In addition, the size of PSD-95-RFP puncta in Sema5B knockdown neurons (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9c, d, f</xref>) and synaptophysin puncta apposing Sema5B knockdown neurons (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">9c, d, g</xref>) was significantly increased. Increased clustering of PSD-95 has been shown to drive synapse maturation by recruiting a number of PDZ domain-containing proteins to postsynaptic sites, which in turn results in an increased accumulation of synaptophysin presynaptically and an increase in miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) (PDZ is an acronym combining the first letters of three proteins first discovered to share the domain: PSD-95, <italic>Drosophila </italic>disc large tumor suppressor (DlgA), and zonula occludens-1 protein (zo-1))[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F9"><label>Figure 9</label><caption><p><bold>Sema5B knockdown increases synapse number and size</bold>. <bold>(a-d) </bold>Confocal images of 9 to 10 days <italic>in vitro </italic>(DIV) hippocampal neurons expressing postsynaptic density (PSD)-95-red fluorescent protein (RFP) plus either green fluorescent protein (GFP) (a) or GFP-short hairpin RNA (shRNA) (b).

The formation and elimination of synaptic connections are particularly prominent during early development, but continue in the adult, and are thought to be essential for the cellular processes underlying learning and memory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Considerable efforts have focused on the mechanisms underlying synaptogenesis; however, relatively little is known about the molecular mechanisms that control the elimination of synaptic contacts. The speed at which synapse disassembly occurs has been shown to be more rapid than the normal rates of protein turnover at the synapse, indicating that synapse disassembly is not only caused by the lack of maintenance of synapses, but rather by mechanisms that actively drive synapse breakdown. For example, the half-life of &#x003b1;-amino-3-hydroxyl-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionate (AMPA) receptors at a synapse has been measured to be 18 to 23 h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] and yet live-imaging studies have demonstrated that synapses containing AMPA receptors can be eliminated in as quickly as 90 minutes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p><p>Our data demonstrates an important role for Sema5B in the elimination of synaptic connections. Overexpression of full-length, wild type Sema5B in hippocampal neurons resulted in a significant reduction in the number of synapses. Surprisingly, the functional regulation appears to be limited to the sema domain as synapse number remained unaffected following overexpression of Sema5B lacking this domain. Using time-lapse imaging of hippocampal neurons bathed in media containing secreted Sema5B fragments, we determined that the decrease in the number of synaptic inputs is not due to failure to form synapses, but rather in a rapid elimination of synapses. Together with the observation that knockdown of Sema5B in cells increases the number and size of synapses, these data demonstrate that Sema5B is expressed and secreted by hippocampal neurons to regulate presynaptic input.</p><sec><title>Proteolytic processing of Sema5B</title><p>A number of Sema5B N-terminal fragments between 110 and 30 kDa were detected by western blot analysis of cortical and hippocampal tissue. Based on our observations of Sema5B expression in other tissues and in heterologous cell lines, full length Sema5B is approximately 150 kDa. This would suggest that in the cortex and hippocampus, Sema5B is cleaved extracellular to the transmembrane domain, releasing an N-terminal protein that most often contains the entire sema domain. This type of cleavage has been observed in another transmembrane semaphorin, Sema4D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Sema4D can be cleaved at the plasma membrane and released into the extracellular environment, resulting in both a membrane-bound and a secreted molecule. A similar cleavage event may regulate Sema5B release in hippocampal neurons, allowing the sema domain to exert its effect in both a paracrine and autocrine manner. Whether Sema5B can function over longer distances is unknown. Many semaphorins, including Sema5A and B, exhibit complex interactions with the extracellular matrix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. In particular, Sema5A and B have been shown to bind to heparin and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans (CSPG) and in the case of Sema5A, this binding regulates its function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Similarly, the punctate distribution of secreted semaphorins along the cell surface and their interactions with their receptor neuoropilin-1 appears to be regulated by proteoglycan binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Whether similar interactions with the extracellular matrix plays a role in localizing Sema5B to hippocampal synapses is unknown.</p><p>Presently, little is known about the Sema5B receptor. While plexin B3 has been shown to function as a receptor for Sema5A in heterologous cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], an alternative, unknown receptor appears to function in neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Identifying the Sema5 receptor(s) is complicated by their interactions with proteoglycans. For example, the binding affinity of Sema5B to CSPG and heparin can be regulated by the level and location of sulfation on the glycosaminoglycan side chain, suggesting an additional level of complexity in regulating Sema5B function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Indeed, Sema5A has been shown to have complete opposite functions depending on whether it is bound by CSPG or heparin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. This suggests the importance of the extracellular matrix (ECM) molecules in potentially regulating Sema5B interactions with its receptor.</p></sec><sec><title>Endogenous localization of Sema5B</title><p>While other semaphorins have been shown to effect synapse function in vertebrate neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], the absence of specific antibodies has not allowed for an examination of their distribution. Nonetheless, other guidance molecules, such as the ephrins and their receptors and repulsive guidance molecules (RGM), have been shown to colocalize and function at the synapse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Here we demonstrate that at least the N-terminal fragments of Sema5B are localized predominantly in the cell body and along dendrites and axons, with modest accumulation observed at synaptic sites. It is possible that Sema5B is proteolytically processed within the cell and the sema domain-containing fragment secreted or that Sema5B is cleaved by extracellular proteases following membrane insertion of the secretory vesicle. It would be of interest to determine how this proteolytic process is regulated and whether this process is modulated in active versus inactive synapses as well as in mature versus developing circuits. It has yet to be definitively demonstrated whether Sema5B is being released by presynaptic or postsynaptic cells; however, our data suggest that Sema5B is being released postsynaptically to regulate presynaptic inputs (discussed below). Our observations suggest that it is the local release of the N-terminal fragment that is important for Sema5B regulation of synapse integrity, however we cannot rule out a function for the C-terminal fragment. Indeed, thrombospondins have previously been shown to play a role in enhancing synaptogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and the C-terminal fragment of Sema5B consists of a number of thrombospondin repeats. Nonetheless, we could find no effect on synapse number or size when we overexpressed a C-terminal fragment that was lacking the sema domain.</p></sec><sec><title>The role of Sema5B in synapse disassembly</title><p>Overexpression of GFP-Sema5B resulted in a significant decrease in the number of synaptic inputs being formed on these cells. This was determined by cotransfecting cells with PSD-95-RFP to identify postsynaptic compartments in Sema5B-overexpressing cells and then immunostaining for the presynaptic marker, synaptophysin. Interestingly, when cells were cotransfected with Sema5B and synaptophysin-RFP to label presynaptic compartments, and immunolabeled with PSD-95 to identify synapses, no change in synapse number was observed. Therefore, our data support the conclusion that Sema5B fragments are being secreted from postsynaptic cells to affect their presynaptic partners. Indeed, although the number of PSD-95-RFP puncta is similar in control and Sema5B overexpressing cells, the proportion of synaptophysin associated with these puncta is reduced. It is unlikely that Sema5B is being secreted presynaptically as the number of synapses being formed by the Sema5B overexpressing neuron onto wild type cells remains constant. This is in accordance with data from the cerebellum and the mammalian neuromuscular junction (NMJ) demonstrating that elimination is induced by the postsynaptic cell, and that presynaptic disassembly precedes postsynaptic disassembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Indeed, it has been proposed that in hippocampal neurons, Sema3A is released from postsynaptic sites and binds to its receptor neuropilin 1 (NP-1) localized to the presynaptic membrane, resulting in a significant reduction in synapses. Although it was reported that extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) phosphorylation occurred in response to Sema3A, the signaling pathway that resulted in synapse disassembly was not identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>If the cell is secreting increased Sema5B fragments, why doesn't it impact the number of its synaptic outputs? Two explanations are possible. First, it is possible that Sema5B fragments do not diffuse freely, but remain local by its association with ECM molecules to mediate its effects locally. This would afford a higher degree of spatial resolution for synapse elimination. Second, it is possible that a sufficient concentration of freely diffusing Sema5B is not reaching synapses being formed by axons and their targets.</p><p>Overexpression of GFP-Sema5B resulted in a loss of presynaptic markers apposed to postsynaptic densities that remain similar in number. In contrast, treatment of neurons with supernatant from HEK293 cells resulted in the rapid loss of postsynaptic markers. This discrepancy is most likely due to the concentration of Sema5B fragments bathing the cell. Moreover, this may reflect the temporal nature of presynaptic and postsynaptic disassembly.</p></sec><sec><title>Sema5B signaling and synapse elimination</title><p>The actin cytoskeleton is known to play a key role in the development and maintenance of young synapses. Presynaptically, treatment of neurons with latrunculin A results in a reduction in the number and size of synaptophysin-labeled clusters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. At the postsynaptic compartment, actin depolymerization has been reported to elicit the internalization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] and diffusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] of neurotransmitter receptors away from the synapse. Moreover, actin regulates the morphology and plasticity of dendritic spines, the postsynaptic compartment for the majority of excitatory synapses. Interestingly, long-term depression induces a shift in the spine F-actin/G-actin ratio to G-actin, and a concomitant decrease in spine head volume with the occasional disappearance of some spines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. The actin cytoskeleton may therefore be a principal target for stabilizing or destabilizing signals that ultimately result in synapse maintenance or elimination.</p><p>Although little is known about the receptor(s) involved in transducing Sema5B function, Sema5B has recently been shown to stimulate growth cone collapse by inducing the disassembly of adhesion complexes and the actin meshwork in growth cones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. This disassembly has been shown to be due to the concurrent activation of calpain and calcineurin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], and it is possible that similar pathways may be activated during synapse disassembly. The protease calpain is particularly intriguing as its activity appears to function in regulating synaptic efficacy and structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Moreover, a number of synaptic structural and signaling proteins are known substrates for calpain, including PSD-95, &#x003b2;-catenin and the actin nucleating proteins cortactin and Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>], suggesting a direct possible mechanism for Sema5B regulation of synapse structure.

Concentrated supernatant that stimulated 50% and 25% growth cone collapse was used for bath application of hippocampal cultures.</p></sec><sec><title>Image analysis and quantification</title><p>Transfected hippocampal neurons and fluorescent immunocytochemical brain sections were imaged using an Olympus Fluoview 1000 confocal microscope (60 &#x000d7;/1.4 Oil Plan-Apochromat; Olympus, Markham, ON, Canada). All images in a given experiment were captured with the same exposure time and conditions. Brightfield vectastain immunocytochemical images were captured using an Axioplan 2 Imaging microscope (Zeiss, Jena, Germany) equipped with a Retiga 1350X camera (Quantitative Imaging Corporation, Burnaby, British Columbia, Canada) and Northern Eclipse software (Empix Imaging, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada).</p></sec><sec><title>Quantification of puncta colocalization</title><p>Images of cells immunolabeled for Sema5B, synaptophysin, or PSD-95 were analyzed using ImageJ with a colocalization plug-in downloaded from the program's website [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>]. Following thresholding, points of colocalization were defined as regions greater than 4 pixels in size where the intensity ratio of the two channels was greater than 50%. Numbers of colocalized puncta were expressed as a percentage of the total number of puncta, quantified using the same threshold and size criteria and excluding colocalized points that appeared to be within the cell body. The average numbers of colocalized synaptic puncta in each treatment group were analyzed for statistical significance using the Student's t test.</p></sec><sec><title>Quantification of PSD-95-GFP puncta following Sema5B bath treatment</title><p>Neurons expressing PSD-95-GFP were bathed in supernatant from wild type HEK293 cells, or cells expressing HA-Sema5B&#x00394;C. For each experiment the concentrated supernatant was diluted in 100 &#x003bc;l culture media just prior to addition to the cells. Cells were imaged every 10 minutes for 60 to 90 minutes immediately following sema bath application. Images were imported into Image J where they were thresholded and analyzed.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunoblot analysis</title><p>Hippocampal and cortical tissues, as well as cultured hippocampal neurons were lysed in approximately 4 volumes (w/v) of buffer containing (50 mM Tris pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 1.0% NP-40, 10% glycerol). Extracts were run using standard SDS-PAGE, and immunoblots probed with anti-Sema5B. Proteins were visualized using enhanced chemiluminence on a Bio-Rad Versadoc 4000.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>TPOC and SXB conceived the study, evaluated the findings, prepared the figures and manuscript.
