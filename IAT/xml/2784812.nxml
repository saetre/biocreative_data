Sixty-one <italic>BmCOEs </italic>were transcribed based on cDNA/ESTs and microarray data. Generally, most of the COEs showed tissue specific expressions and expression level between male and female did not display obvious differences. Three main patterns could be classified, i.e. midgut-, head and integument-, and silk gland-specific expressions. Midgut is the first barrier of xenobiotics peroral toxicity, in which COEs may be involved in eliminating secondary metabolites of mulberry leaves and contaminants of insecticides in diet. For head and integument-class, most of the members were homologous to odorant-degrading enzyme (ODE) and antennal esterase. RT-PCR verified that the ODE-like esterases were also highly expressed in larvae antenna and maxilla, and thus they may play important roles in degradation of plant volatiles or other xenobiotics.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p><italic>B. mori </italic>has the largest number of insect COE genes characterized to date.

Our results provide some new insights into functions and evolutionary characteristics of COEs in phytophagous insects.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Carboxylesterase (COE, EC 3.1.1.1) is a multigene family and occurs in animals, plants, insects, and microbes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. COEs are mainly attributed to B esterases, which were essentially irreversibly inhibited by organophosphate insecticides (OPs). Based on sequence similarity and substrate specificity, insect COE genes can be subdivided into eight subfamilies: &#x003b1;-esterase (ae), &#x003b2;-esterase (be), juvenile hormone esterase (jhe), gliotactins (gli), acetylcholinesterases (ace, AChE), neurotactins (nrt), neuroligins (nlg), and glutactin (glt) class [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. &#x003b1;-esterases, &#x003b2;-esterases, acetylcholinesterases and juvenile hormone esterase account for the majority of the catalytically active COEs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Gliotactins, neurotactins, neuroligins, and glutactin classes are generally considered to be noncatalytic but have a variety of functions essential to development and neurogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>COEs have a broad range of functions; the key role is hydrolyzing esters of carboxylic acids. Carboxylesterases are also a class of the metabolic enzymes involved in insecticide resistance, which are implicated in the resistance of insects to OPs, carbamates, and pyrethroids through gene amplification, upregulation and coding sequence mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Furthermore, COEs also play important roles in allelochemical metabolism and tolerance, although the roles were validated only at the biochemical level in a few cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In addition, carboxylesterases can serve as noncatalytic adhesive proteins involved in cell-to-cell interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] and participate in other functions, such as pheromone degradation in moths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and hydrolysis of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine and juvenile hormone (JH) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Studies on insect carboxylesterases have been mainly focused on mediating insecticide resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Relatively, the mechanism of degrading plant allelochemicals is still unclear, and only some biochemical evidence confirmed that COEs were related to detoxification of the secondary metabolites of plants. Carboxylesterases can be induced by phenolic glycosides in <italic>Papilio Canadensis </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], and its activity was positively correlated with the survival rate of the gypsy moth, suggesting that esterase may be responsible for glycoside metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In the tobacco cutworm, <italic>Spodoptera litura</italic>, sublethal doses of the widely occurring plant glycoside rutin resulted in a significant increase in midgut carboxylesterase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. It was also found that COEs can be induced by indole alkaloid gramine in <italic>Sitobion avenae</italic>, and the increase of COE activity was positively correlated with dietary gramine concentrations, suggesting that COEs were involved in gramine detoxification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In addition, quercetin, rutin and 2-tridaconone can also induce the activities of COEs in insects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>Herbivorous animals encounter a wide variety of secondary products in the plants on which they feed. They must therefore have developed mechanisms to metabolically inactivate some of the potentially toxic plant chemicals that they ingest. Silkworm is phytophagous insect, and specifically feeds on mulberry, which also encounters a mass of allelochemicals from its host plant. Because the silkworm grows well on mulberry leaves, the toxicities and defensive activities of these leaves against herbivorous insects have been overlooked. However, a recent study revealed that mulberry latex rich in sugar-mimic alkaloids was highly toxic to caterpillars [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Some alkaloids contained in mulberry leaves are potential inhibitors of mammalian digestive glycosidases but not inhibitors of silkworm midgut glycosidases, suggesting that the silkworm has enzymes specially adapted to enable it to feed on mulberry leaves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. In addition, &#x003b2;-fructofuranosidase was characterized in the silkworm genome, which has been no direct experimental evidence that this gene is encoded in the genome of animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. <italic>Bmsuc1 </italic>played an important role in avoiding the toxic effects of 1,4-dideoxy-1,4-imino-D-arabinitol (D-AB1) and 1-deoxynojirimycin (DNJ) that are present in extremely high concentrations in the mulberry latex. In the "animal-plant warfare", silkworm has developed the mechanisms to metabolically inactivate those potentially toxic chemicals, such as detoxification enzyme carboxylesterase, cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450) and glutathione S-transferase (GST), etc. Thus, silkworm can be used as a model of the insect-plant interaction.</p><p><italic>B. mori </italic>is an economically important insect and the Lepidoptera model for the study of pest control in agriculture. Recently, the fine genome map of the silkworm has been assembled. Totally, 87% of the scaffold sequences were anchored to all 28 chromosomes and 14,623 genes were predicted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. In addition, carboxylesterases are a functionally important superfamily, which play important roles in insecticide resistance, allelochemical tolerance, and developmental regulation. Previous studies on silkworm carboxylesterases mainly focused on isozyme polymorphism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Herein, we present the identification and genomic analysis of silkworm COEs using the newly assembled 9&#x000d7; genome sequence. We have searched available EST data for each silkworm COE to confirm active transcription and examined the expression patterns using the genome-wide microarray of the silkworm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Studying the expressions and evolutionary aspects of such large family of COEs will help us understand its functional versatilities.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec><title>Annotation and phylogeny of <italic>B. mori </italic>COEs</title><p><italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, <italic>Anopheles gambiae </italic>and <italic>Apis mellifera </italic>COEs were retrieved from GenBank and used for blast search against the new assembly of the silkworm genome to characterize the COE superfamily in <italic>B. mori</italic>.

It can be seen from Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> that the topology of phylogenetic tree was very similar to those obtained in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Insect carboxylesterases can be divided into fourteen clades and three major classes (intracellular catalytic, secreted catalytic, and neurodevelopmental classes) based on the phylogenetic tree. The gene numbers of neurodevelopmental class and secreted catalytic class were alike in the four organisms, especially, the orthologous genes in neurodevelopmental class can be unambiguously defined (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Thus, this class of COEs might be involved in essential steps in conserved physiological pathways and subject to function constraints. While &#x003b1;-esterases were independently expanded in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, <italic>Ap. mellifera</italic>, and <italic>An. gambiae</italic>, the silkworm &#x003b1;-esterases experienced an obvious species-specific expansion: 55 &#x003b1;-esterase members were identified. This suggested that this class of COEs may play important roles in the adaptation of these insects to their specific biological niches rather than fulfilling general housekeeping functions.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Neighbor-joining tree of amino acid sequences from <italic>B. mori</italic>, <italic>Ap. mellifera</italic>, and <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, and some known COEs in other Lepidopteran insects</bold>.

Most of the variants of the catalytic triad in the silkworm &#x003b1;-esterases were phylogenetically related to the variants of GESAG, which formed a cluster boxed on the phylogenetic tree. Similarity analysis of amino acid sequences indicated that &#x003b1;-esterases with substitutions in catalytic triad shared &#x0003c; 30% identity with other &#x003b1;-esterases, and most of them were only about 20%.

JHEs contain some specific characteristics, such as a GQSAG core catalytic motif required for JH-specific esterase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], a particular amphipathic helix as for a characteristic of Lepidopteran JHEs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. The analysis of catalytic triad indicated that <italic>Bm</italic>JHE1 contained the specific GQSAG motif while <italic>Bm</italic>JHE2 and <italic>Bm</italic>JHE4 had the GESAG, and <italic>Bm</italic>JHE3 had GESSG. Only <italic>Bm</italic>JHE1 and <italic>Bm</italic>JHE4 were identified to have the three Args (R 174, 181, 185) along one face of an amphipathic helix.

Based on sequence characteristics and known functional data, we speculated that <italic>Bm</italic>JHE1 was the only one physiologically functional JHE in the silkworm, and that those new duplicated JHEs might have evolved other functions.</p><p>In insects, most of pheromone molecules are strongly hydrophobic and therefore tend to adhere to waxy surfaces. Both male and female may need to remove the pheromones from their integument so that they can better identify and control the signal, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. During this signaling, integument esterase plays important role in inactivation of pheromones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. In total, two putative integument esterases were identified in the silkworm (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).

In addition, identities among silkworm and <italic>Drosophila </italic>integument esterases were about 44%. Thus, integument esterases among insect species showed higher similarities and played similar roles in degrading pheromone or detoxifying xenobiotics entered into integument.</p><p>Although the number of &#x003b2;-esterase genes is not big in insects, these enzymes have multiple functions, including metabolic resistance to OPs and carbamates in Hemipteran insects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], reproductive function in Diptera [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], and pheromone signaling in Lepidoptera [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>].

Four and nine glutactins were found in <italic>D. melanogaster </italic>and <italic>An. gambiae</italic>, respectively, while no glutactin gene was found in the silkworm and <italic>Ap. mellifera</italic>. However, uncharacterized clade (H) was phylogenetically related to <italic>Drosophila </italic>glutactin clade. <italic>Bmun1 </italic>shared 36.2% and 32.3% amino acid identities with CG5397 and GB15536, respectively, and the three genes may be 1 : 1 : 1 orthologs.

Thus, these genes were generated by duplication events occurred before insect radiation and might have experienced purifying selection process after speciation. Acetylcholinesterases (AChEs) were the only enzymes that perform catalytic function in the neurodevelopmental class. Furthermore, they may be the important target of OPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. In Drosophilidae and Muscidae, only one ace gene was identified, while two ace genes were found in other Dipteran, Hymenoptera, and Lepidopteran insects. On the phylogenetic tree, ace clade can be obviously divided into ace1 and ace2 subclades (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).

In addition, an inhibition assay indicated that both of them can be inhibited by eserine and paraoxon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. However, the alignment of known Lepidopteran AChEs indicated that AChE1 had protrudent C-terminal compared with AChE2, and AChE2 (position at 150-230 aa) had an insertion of 18 incontinuous amino acids like the hydrophilic insertion in DipteranAChE, which had 31 residues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>].

The neuroligin clade (M) contained three pairs of 1 : 1 : 1 orthologs. This indicated that most of the neuroligins were duplicated before radiation of the three species.

Most of the other tandem arranged COEs also showed 40% - 50% amino acid identities among members in a cluster. The tandem arranged COEs might be created by local duplications. Tandem arranged COEs tend to form a family, however, some are not the case. For example, <italic>Bmnlg1 </italic>and <italic>Bmae2 </italic>were tandem arranged but shared only 17% identity identities, and located in a mixed gene cluster with three alpha-esterases (<italic>Bmae50 - 52</italic>) and four JHEs (<italic>Bmjhe1 - 4</italic>).

In the silkworm genome, six neuroligins were found; four of six were located on the chromosome 15, which spanned about 1.1 Mb (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3b</xref>). The four silkworm neuroligins showed similar gene arrangement to those in <italic>Ap. mellifera</italic>, <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, and <italic>An. gambiae</italic>.

Fifteen &#x003b1;-esterases were found in the silkworm but they mutated in the catalytic triad, which may result in loss of the hydrolase activity. Based on the ESTs/microarray datasets, most of these &#x003b1;-esterases (11/15) had expression evidence (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>). Thus, these &#x003b1;-esterases may acquire new functions. Previous studies indicated that esterase gene amplification is one of the important mechanisms resistant to organophosphorus and carbamate insecticides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. The amplified esterases can produce broad spectrum insecticide resistance through rapid-binding (sequestration) mechanism. So we supposed that these amplified &#x003b1;-esterases may play roles in sequestering secondary metabolites of mulberry leaves or insecticide contaminants in diet. In addition, due to mutation of the catalytic triad and no expression evidence, <italic>Bmae6 </italic>and <italic>Bmae28 </italic>may be pseudogenes.</p></sec><sec><title>Midgut-specific expression genes</title><p>Twenty-two <italic>BmCOE </italic>genes were found to be predominantly expressed in the midgut and their expression levels did not significantly differ between male and female (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, group I).

It should be noted that <italic>Bmae3</italic>, <italic>ae18</italic>, <italic>ae27</italic>, and <italic>ae30 </italic>mutated in the catalytic triad were also included in this class. Thus, most of the midgut-specific expression genes should have hydrolyzing function. The potential hazard faced in sericulture is the occasional contamination of the mulberry leaves by air-borne insecticides that have been used in neighboring fields. Midgut is the first barrier of xenobiotics peroral toxicity, in which COEs can eliminate insecticides, such as OPs, carbamate insecticides, on mulberry leaves.</p><p>Silkworm is the phytophagous insect, and specifically feeds on mulberry, which also encounters a mass of allelochemicals from its host plant. A recent study revealed that mulberry latex rich in sugar-mimic alkaloids was highly toxic to caterpillars [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. That silkworm is less affected by sugar-mimic alkaloid is due to insensitivity of <italic>B. mori </italic>glycosidases and &#x003b2;-fructofuranosidase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. So, during the evolution of the silkworm adapted to host plant mulberry, many mechanisms have been selected. COEs can be induced by multiple allelochemicals, such as phenolic glycosides, quercetin, rutin. Indeed, mulberry leaves contain these secondary metabolites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. The fact that a large numbers of <italic>BmCOEs </italic>were predominantly expressed in the midgut may suggest that these genes might also play important roles in tolerating the relevant allelochemicals. Like the COEs, UDP-glucosyltransferases were also expanded in the silkworm relative to Dipteran and Hymenopteran insects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Thus, these expanded superfamilies may represent the characteristic of phytophagous insect.</p><p>Some of midgut carboxylesterases were expressed not only in the midgut, but also in the other tissues such as malpighian tubule, integument, head, fat body and testis. Especially, one cluster in group (I) including seven COE genes was found to be predominantly expressed in the malpighian tubule. The function of insect malpighian tubule is similar to mammalian kidney, which plays important roles in defending against insecticides such as DDT and metabolism of plant secondary and other molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. Thus, these COEs predominantly expressed in the malpighian tubule may be important detoxification enzymes that eliminate insecticides and allelochemicals. Simultaneously, these midgut carboxylesterases expressed in other tissues had important roles in protecting silkworms from xenobiotic damages.</p></sec><sec><title>Head and integument-specific expression genes</title><p>The head and integument specific group (II) included &#x003b1;-esterase, jhe, &#x003b2;-esterase, integument esterase, and neuroligin genes.

For example, <italic>Bmae32 </italic>and <italic>Bmnlg6 </italic>showed male-predominant expression in the reproductive system, whereas <italic>Bmun1 </italic>was a female-predominant expression gene. <italic>Bmie1 </italic>and <italic>Bmie2 </italic>were also expressed in homocyte, and the former showed higher expression level in the anterior/median silk gland (A/MSG) and the latter was also expressed in fat body, midgut, and malpighian tubule.</p><p>ODEs/PDEs, antennal and integument esterases play important roles in degrading odorants/pheromones, such as volatile acetate compounds; these enzymes belong to &#x003b1;-esterase, &#x003b2;-esterase and integument esterase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. In addition, for the herbivorous insects, odorant/pheromone-degrading esterase may have a role in the degradation of plant volatiles with an ester functional group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. Previous studies showed that <italic>Apol</italic>-ODE and <italic>Apol</italic>-PDE could be detected in adult male antennae, but not in female antennae and other control tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. <italic>Apol</italic>-IE, <italic>Mbra</italic>-EST, <italic>Slit</italic>-EST and <italic>Snon</italic>-EST were expressed in male and female antennae whereas <italic>Slit</italic>-EST and <italic>Snon</italic>-EST showed higher expression in legs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. For the silkworm, only larvae fetch mulberry leaves and also encounter a mass of volatile allelochemicals, such as hexyenyl acetate, 3-hexenyl acetate and 2-hexenyl acetate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. Based on the microarray data, it was found that <italic>BmCOEs </italic>phylogenetically related to odorant/pheromone-degrading esterases were specifically expressed in the head and integument of the silkworm larvae (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, group II). Thus, we employed RT-PCR technique to analyze the expression patterns in larva antenna and maxilla, on which important olfactory sensilla are distributed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>], and adult antennae and leg to presume the function of head and integument-specific expression esterases, excluding <italic>Bmnlg6 </italic>and <italic>Bmjhe1</italic>. The results indicated that most of the head and integument-specific expression esterases were expressed in larva antennae and maxilla (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5a</xref>). Except for the <italic>Bmae35, ae40 </italic>and <italic>un1</italic>, others did not show obvious expression differences between female and male. The antenna and maxilla of the silkworm larvae are important olfactory organs. Thus, we predicted that these esterases would play important roles in degrading the volatile acetate allelochemicals and adaptive evolution of silkworm with mulberry leaves. In addition, The pheromone of <italic>B. mori </italic>is a blend of alcohol (bombykol) and aldehyde (bombykal) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. Antennal specific aldehyde oxidase (AOX) can degrade bombykal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Bombykol was inactivated firstly by conversion, including the oxidation of the pheromones by oxidases and/or dehydrogenases to the corresponding fatty acids, and secondly by degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. Thus, odorant/pheromone-degrading like esterases in the silkworm may indirectly play role in degrading the pheromones. Furthermore, <italic>Bmae33</italic>, <italic>ae35 </italic>and <italic>Bmbe1 </italic>showed lower or no expression in adult antennae, suggesting that they may have different functions from their corresponding orthologous genes. In addition, it was observed that some head and integument-specific esterases were also expressed in adult antennae and legs.

The expanded &#x003b1;-esterases were predominantly expressed in midgut, head and integument, and silkgland, respectively, suggesting that they may participate in allelochemical tolerance and synthesis of silk proteins. Generally, &#x003b1;-esterases contain the conserved catalytic triad and showed catalytic function. However, 15 of 55 silkworm &#x003b1;-esterases mutated at the essential catalytic residue sites, implying that they may acquire some new functions. On the basis of tissue microarray, the putative odorant/pheromone-degrading esterases and related genes predominantly expressed in head and integument of the silkworm larvae were detected. RT-PCR verified that these genes were also expressed in the larvae antenna and maxilla, suggesting that they play important roles in detoxifying plant volatiles. In addition, <italic>Bmbe2 </italic>were specifically expressed in the adult MAGs, which may have a similar function of <italic>Drosophila EST-6</italic>, influencing egg-laying behavior and possibly receptivity to remating. In sum, our results provide some new insight into annotation and evolutionary characteristics of the silkworm COEs.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Identification of the <italic>B. mori </italic>COE genes</title><p>COEs amino acid sequences of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, <italic>An. gambiae</italic>, and <italic>Ap. mellifera </italic>were downloaded from the GenBank <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/</ext-link>.
