Because of their similarity in gene structure and protein sequences, they are believed to have evolved from a common ancestral gene through several rounds of gene duplication and subsequent divergence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006163-RandWeaver1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006163-Kawauchi1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Living vertebrates are divided into two lineages: the jawless vertebrates (Cyclostomes) and the jawed vertebrates (Gnathostomes). The jawless vertebrates, represented only by hagfish and lamprey today, are regarded as the basal group of vertebrates. The jawed vertebrates are divided into cartilaginous fishes (Chondrichthyes), bony fishes (Osteichthyes) and tetrapods. The cartilaginous fish are regarded as the basal group of jawed vertebrates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006163-Venkatesh1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Till now, PRL sequences have been characterized in many different vertebrate species, ranging from the most primitive ray-finned fish to mammals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006163-Kawauchi1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. In contrast to GHs and SLs, PRL sequences exhibit great divergence among different vertebrate taxa and its evolutionary history has long been an intriguing question. Sequence analysis showed that all the tetrapod PRLs possess three conserved disulfide linkages, while the teleost PRLs only contain two disulfide linkages. On the basis of this difference, a hypothesis was thus proposed suggesting that the evolution of PRL can be branched into two lineages, i.e. the tetrapod lineage and the teleost lineage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006163-Kawauchi2">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006163-Manzon1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. This hypothesis can accommodate the PRLs identified in teleosts and tetrapods so far. However several questions regarding PRL evolution and classification remained unanswered. First, when all fish lineages (Chondricthyes, Chondrostei, Ginglymodi and Teleostei) are included in the analysis, the evolutionary picture becomes obscure because the sturgeon (Chondrostei) PRL has three disulfide linkages which is the same as tetrapod PRLs. However, sturgeon PRL shares a higher homology with the teleost PRLs than that of the tetrapod <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006163-Noso1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. Second, the occurrence and the complete evolutionary picture of PRLs in vertebrates has not been fully elucidated because of the absence of PRL information in Chondricthyes and Cyclostomes so far. Third, after a single GH with two conserved disulfide linkages was identified in a jawless fish, lamprey (<italic>Petromyzon marinus</italic>), GH was regarded as the ancestor of the GH/PRL/SL family and PRL present in gnathostomes was regarded as the gene duplication and subsequent diversification product of this ancestral GH <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006163-Kawauchi4">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. However, all GHs contain two disulfide linkages only while the sturgeon and tetrapod PRLs contain three. Thus the question of when PRLs have acquired the additional disulfide linkage and what evolutionary processes they have experienced after the duplication event remains unclear. Considering that Chondrichthyes and Cyclostomes occupy strategic positions in the evolution of bony fish and jawed animals, and that their genome information is now available, these valuable resources render us the possibility of understanding more about the evolutionary history of PRLs in vertebrates.</p><p>To date, the genomic sequences of sea lamprey and elephant shark (<italic>Callorhinchus milii</italic>, a cartilaginous fish) have become available. Such sequence information can provide important cues on the evolution of some specific genes. In this study, we have searched the genomes of these two species together with other vertebrate and invertebrate genomes. We have found a new <italic>PRL</italic>-like gene in almost all the non-mammalian vertebrate classes, ranging from cartilaginous fish to tetrapods. Subsequent analysis demonstrates that this novel gene contains five exons and four introns, the same as other members of the <italic>GH</italic> gene family. Phylogenetic analyses show that the protein encoded by this novel gene is more homologous to the previously identified PRLs than to GHs and SLs. Receptor transactivation assay demonstrates that this protein is biologically active and could activate the PRL receptor (PRLR). Considering its close phylogenetic homology to PRL and its biological activity in activating the PRLR, we name it as PRL2 and the previously identified PRL as PRL1. In addition, using zebrafish as the animal model, we have further studied the tissue distribution and physiological function of PRL2. The results showed that this novel PRL2 is strikingly different from the classical PRL1 in many aspects.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Sequence characterization</title><p>In this study, we first searched for the presence of putative <italic>GH</italic> family members in the genomes of elephant shark as well as other distantly related vertebrates and invertebrates. The results showed the absence of <italic>SL</italic>-like genes in elephant shark or lamprey genomes. On the other hand, a <italic>PRL</italic>-like gene (encoding for a protein which we subsequently called PRL2) could be identified in almost all the non-mammalian vertebrate taxa by either bioinformatics or molecular cloning means: Chondrichthyes (elephant shark), Chondrostei (Russian sturgeon, <italic>Acipenser gueldenstaedti</italic>), Teleostei including zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>), Nile tilapia (<italic>Oreochromis niloticus</italic>), black seabream (<italic>Acanthopagrus schlegeli</italic>), goldfish (<italic>Carassius auratus</italic>), <italic>Tetraodon</italic> (<italic>Tetraodon nigroviridis</italic>) and medaka (<italic>Oryzias latipes</italic>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006163.s003">Figures S1</xref>,<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006163.s004">S2</xref>,<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006163.s005">S3</xref>,<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006163.s006">S4</xref>,<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006163.s007">S5</xref>,<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006163.s008">S6</xref>,<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006163.s009">S7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006163.s010">S8</xref>). We have also predicted a partial PRL2 sequence in a reptile, the green anole lizard (<italic>Anolis carolinensis</italic>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006163.s011">Figure S9</xref>). Despite our repeated efforts by prediction and cloning, we failed to obtain its full-length sequence. A possible explanation is that this gene has become a pseudogene in lizard. We have also confirmed that an avian PRL, the chicken (<italic>Gallus gallus</italic>) PRLb (NCBI accession no. XP_416043), is in fact a PRL2. In addition we have obtained the full-length cDNA of PRL1 from spotted gar (<italic>Lepisosteus oculatus</italic>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006163.s012">Figure S10</xref>), the coding regions of PRL1 from medaka (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006163.s013">Figure S11</xref>) and PRL1a from African clawed frog (<italic>Xenopus laevis</italic>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006163.s014">Figure S12</xref>). On the other hand however, PRL2 could not be found in any of the available mammalian genomes indicating that this gene was lost after the divergence that gave rise to the mammalian lineage. Protein sequence comparison shows that PRL2 and PRL1 share a low sequence identity with each other (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006163.s001">Table S1A</xref>) while PRL2s share a higher identity among themselves (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006163.s001">Table S1B</xref>).</p><p>Subsequent to the identification of these PRL2 sequences, phylogenetic analyses were carried out on the different GHs, SLs, PRLs and PLs by three commonly adopted methods of phylogenetic analysis, viz. neighbor-joining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006163-g001">Figure 1</xref>), maximum-likelihood (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006163.s015">Figure S13</xref>) and Bayesian analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006163.s016">Figure S14</xref>). The results from these three different methods all show that the PRLs are clustered into two separate clades, viz. the PRL1 and PRL2 clades which are distinct from the GH and SL clades. The PRL1 clade contains the classical PRL sequences identified from all the bony fish and tetrapods so far. The PRL2 clade contains the novel PRL sequences obtained from almost all the gnathostomes examined in the present study. Both the <italic>Xenopus</italic> PRL1a and PRL1b belong to the PRL1 clade. The results are also consistent with previous studies that human PL was derived from a duplication of the GH gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006163-Chen1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, while PLs in rodents <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006163-Lin1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref> and ruminants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006163-Anthony1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref> were derived from the PRL gene. A protein sequence alignment of different PRLs was also performed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006163-g002">Figure 2</xref>). From this figure, it can be seen that the newly identified PRL2 contains three disulfide linkages with the only exception of the shark PRL2 which contains only two. The teleost PRL1 has lost the first disulfide linkage at the N-terminal.</p><fig id="pone-0006163-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0006163.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Phylogenetic analysis of PRL, GH, SL and PL sequences.</title><p>Mega 3.0 was used to construct the tree.

We name it as PRL2 because of its phylogenetic relationship with the previously identified PRL and its ability to activate PRLR.</p><p>In previous studies, sequence analyses showed that all tetrapod PRLs possess three conserved disulfide linkages, while teleost PRLs contain only two. On the basis of this difference, the two-lineage hypothesis has been proposed to account for the evolution of PRL in fish, viz. the tetrapod lineage and the teleost lineage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006163-RandWeaver1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006163-Kawauchi2">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006163-Kawauchi3">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Our data showed that this hypothesis can only accommodate the classical PRL1 sequences but is not applicable to the novel PRL2 sequences discovered in this study. All the PRL2 sequences possess three conserved disulfide linkages except elephant shark PRL2 which contains only two (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006163-g002">Figure 2</xref>). But sequence comparison showed that the elephant shark PRL2 actually shares a higher sequence identity with other PRL2s than with PRL1s (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006163.s001">Table S1A and B</xref>), and this is also consistent with the phylogenetic analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006163-g001">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006163.s015">SI Figures 13</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006163.s016">14</xref>). However, we could not find PRL1 in elephant shark. The elephant shark PRL2 is the most primitive PRL identified so far. We have in fact searched the genomes of two chordates, viz. the sea squirt (<italic>Ciona intestinalis</italic>) as well as the lancelet (<italic>Branchiostoma floridae</italic>) and a jawless fish, the sea lamprey, but no <italic>PRL</italic>-like genes could be found in these genomes. However, the absence of a <italic>PRL</italic>-like gene in the lamprey genome could be due to the incomplete genome information at the moment.</p><p>Interestingly, we have successfully cloned a PRL2 from the most primitive ray-finned fish, the sturgeon. Sequence analysis shows that both this PRL2 and the previously identified sturgeon PRL1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006163-Noso1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref> contain three disulfide linkages but share very low sequence identity with each other (34.7&#x00025;) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0006163.s001">Table S1A</xref>). Phylogenetic analyses show that this sturgeon PRL2 is orthologous to the shark PRL2 and tetrapod PRL2. Therefore we hypothesize that there exists another PRL (PRL1) in cartilaginous fish as in tetrapods and other fish species. This cartilaginous fish PRL1 may have been lost in elephant shark in a species-specific manner during evolution, or we failed to predict it from the elephant shark genome due to its incomplete genome sequence information, with a 75&#x00025; coverage till now <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006163-Venkatesh1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Sequences obtained from other cartilaginous fish such as the sharks, rays, skates would be useful to clarify this issue.</p><p>To date, gene duplication and loss have been considered to be the primary force of new gene evolution. This phenomenon is evident in a number of sequenced genomes ranging from bacteria to human <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006163-Zhang1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. The 2R hypothesis is a generally accepted model to explain the evolution of gene families and of vertebrate genomes. In this model, two rounds of genome duplication, often referred to as 1R and 2R, occurred after the divergence of tunicates and lancelets from vertebrates (1R) but before the divergence of cartilaginous fishes and bony vertebrates (2R) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006163-Ohno1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006163-Dehal1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Till now, the most primitive member of the GH family is the GH found in sea lamprey. Other members of the GH family were considered duplication products of this gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006163-Kawauchi4">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Although the exact time of its occurrence is not completely certain, 2R is believed to have occurred before the divergence of cartilaginous fish and bony fish <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006163-Venkatesh1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006163-Meyer1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. According to this genome duplication theory, it is unlikely that the four genes in jawed vertebrates, i.e. GH, PRL1, PRL2 and SL, were duplication products of the single GH in jawless vertebrates. A recent paper reported that 2R occurred before the cyclostomes-gnathostome split <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006163-Kuraku1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Since none of the GH family members has been found in invertebrates, these genes were very likely derived from 2R concomitantly. The identity and function of the ancestral gene of the GH family is an intriguing question. Answers to this question would await the isolation and study of an orthologue of these four genes in a chordate such as urochordates or cephalochordates where the ancestral gene is not duplicated. An additional round of genome duplication (3R), also known as the fish-specific genome duplication (FSGD), occurred during the evolution of teleost <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006163-Meyer1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006163-Volff1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. However, the novel PRL2 in teleost fish was not derived from FSGD because it shows an orthologous relationship with the shark and tetrapod PRL2. We believe that both PRL1 and PRL2 in teleost have undergone FSGD but a copy of the duplicated PRL1 and PRL2 has probably been lost due to its redundant physiological function.</p><p>Divergent functions of the duplicated genes might help permanent preservation of the genes. Only if the duplicated genes acquire new functions which are not overlapping with the original gene can the new genes be preserved <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006163-Force1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. Our finding provides another good example to support this gene retention theory. The unique tissue expression pattern of PRL2 and its involvement in the retinogenesis of teleost justify its co-existence with PRL1. The differences between their physiological functions necessitate the need for keeping both genes in non-mammalian vertebrates. However, the reason for the loss of the PRL2 gene in mammals during evolution is not known.</p><p>The existence of more than one form of PRL has been reported previously in some vertebrate taxa, including teleost <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006163-Chan1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006163-Yasuda2">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, amphibian <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006163-Yamashita1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, rodents <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006163-Wiemers1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref> and primates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006163-Wallis1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. All these multiple forms of PRLs are very similar to each other and they all belong to the PRL1 clade. They are likely the products of single or multiple gene duplication in each specific species and are entirely different from the novel PRL2 reported in the present study. Besides fish, we also found a partial PRL2 sequence in green lizard and confirmed that the chicken PRLb belongs to the PRL2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006163-g001">Figure 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Receptor transactivation assay</title><p>In the reporter transactivation assays, only zfPRL1 can trigger the downstream post-receptor event via interacting with both zfPRLR1 and zfPRLR2.

In addition, zfPRL1 and zfPRL2 are inactive towards zfGHR1 and zfGHR2, indicating their specificity of action.
