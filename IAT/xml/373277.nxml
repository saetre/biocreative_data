These riboswitches selectively bind metabolites and modulate gene expression in response to changing ligand concentrations. Previously, we provided evidence that the <italic>btuB</italic> mRNAs of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> each carry a coenzyme B<sub>12</sub>-dependent riboswitch that causes repressed translation of the encoded cobalamin-transport protein at elevated coenzyme concentrations.

RNA structures that conform to this model are widespread in both Gram-positive and Gram-negative organisms. In addition, we find that the 5&#x02032;-untranslated region (5&#x02032;-UTR) of the cobalamin biosynthesis (<italic>cob</italic>) operon of <italic>S.typhimurium</italic> carries an RNA motif that matches this consensus sequence. Biochemical and genetic characterization of this motif confirms that the RNA directly binds coenzyme B<sub>12</sub>, and that it likely serves as a genetic control element for regulating expression of the 25-gene operon for cobalamin production in this pathogen.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Riboswitches serve as ligand-responsive genetic control elements that modulate the expression of certain genes in response to changing concentrations of metabolites. These RNA elements are typically embedded within the 5&#x02032;-UTR of specific prokaryotic mRNAs, and are composed of two functional and sometimes distinct structural domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh167c1">1</xref>). One domain serves as a natural aptamer that binds the target metabolite with high selectivity. The other domain is an &#x02018;expression platform&#x02019; that harnesses allosteric changes in RNA structure, brought about by aptamer&#x02013;ligand complex formation, to control expression of the adjacent gene or operon. In prokaryotes, expression platforms have been identified that control transcription termination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh167c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh167c3">3</xref>) or translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh167c4">4</xref>).</p><p>To date, seven fundamental metabolites are known to be detected by riboswitches, which are responsible for contributing to the genetic regulation of at least 68 genes in <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh167c5">5</xref>). These targets include the nucleobases guanine and adenine, the amino acid lysine, and the coenzymes thiamine pyrophosphate, FMN, SAM and B<sub>12</sub> (adenosylcobalamin or AdoCbl). Several classes of riboswitches have been shown by database searches to be distributed widely amongst prokaryotic organisms, and some examples have been identified in archeans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh167c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh167c6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh167c8">8</xref>). Sequence variants of the natural aptamer for thiamine pyrophosphate also have been identified in certain fungal and plant mRNAs, where they bind the coenzyme with affinities that match those of their prokaryotic counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh167c9">9</xref>). These findings indicate that riboswitches are a fundamental and widespread form of genetic control.</p><p>Initial confirmation that an mRNA domain directly binds to a metabolite in the absence of proteins was achieved by examining a 202-nucleotide fragment of the 5&#x02032;-UTR of the <italic>btuB</italic> gene of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, and similarly by examining the homologous mRNA fragment for <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh167c10">10</xref>). The fragment derived from <italic>E.coli</italic> binds coenzyme B<sub>12</sub> with an apparent dissociation constant of &#x0223c;300 nM, while related analogs such as cyanocobalamin and methylcobalamin do not exhibit measurable binding. In the current study, a refined consensus sequence and structural model for the coenzyme B<sub>12</sub> class of riboswitches is presented. We establish that the 5&#x02032;-leader sequence for the <italic>cob</italic> mRNA conforms to this consensus motif and that it directly binds coenzyme B<sub>12</sub> with an apparent <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> that matches those of related riboswitches. Furthermore, we identify a variant form of the B<sub>12</sub> riboswitch class from <italic>B.subtilis</italic> that retains ligand-binding and genetic control functions despite the absence of nearly half of the conserved core that is typically indicative of a coenzyme B<sub>12</sub> aptamer. The latter observation suggests that this class of riboswitches is composed of modular structural domains and that significant alterations to structure and function can occur through evolution.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIAL AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Chemicals and oligonucleotides</title><p>Coenzyme B<sub>12</sub> was purchased from Sigma and both tritiated coenzyme B<sub>12</sub> (&#x0005b;<sup>3</sup>H&#x0005d;AdoCbl) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh167c11">11</xref>) and PurCbl were gifts from K.

Both RNAs bind coenzyme B<sub>12</sub> (5&#x02032;-deoxy-5&#x02032;-adenosylcobalamin or AdoCbl) with high affinity and specificity, and thus function as natural aptamers for this important metabolite. These RNAs, along with the 5&#x02032;-UTR of the <italic>cob</italic> gene from <italic>S.typhimurium</italic>, carry a short conserved sequence domain termed the B<sub>12</sub> box (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh167c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh167c14">14</xref>), and therefore they likely share structural and functional homology.</p><p>Although we proposed a partial secondary structural model for the riboswitch domains present in the <italic>btuB</italic> mRNAs from <italic>E.coli</italic> and <italic>S.typhimurium</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh167c10">10</xref>), the model was not in agreement with that proposed recently for the 5&#x02032;-UTR of the <italic>cob</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh167c14">14</xref>). To improve upon the structural model, additional examples of the coenzyme B<sub>12</sub> class of riboswitches were identified in other organisms. This was achieved through an iterative approach to secondary-structure modeling and comparative sequence analysis using a computer algorithm. The algorithm (SequenceSniffer; J. E. Barrick and R. R. Breaker, unpublished) searches genomic databases for domains that correspond closely to specific sequence and structural constraints, and has been used previously to identify homologs for the TPP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh167c9">9</xref>), guanine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh167c5">5</xref>), SAM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh167c7">7</xref>) and lysine riboswitches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh167c15">15</xref>). More specifically, database searches such as these are effective in revealing similar aptamer domains, as the metabolite-binding portions of riboswitches are the most highly conserved amongst various organisms and amongst different mRNAs within a single organism.</p><p>A total of 92 different representatives of the coenzyme B<sub>12</sub> class of riboswitches were identified and compared by sequence alignment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh167f1">1</xref>; see also the Rfam database for additional representatives) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh167c16">16</xref>). Upon examination of the sequence alignments, a pattern of conserved sequence and secondary-structure elements that are present in all representatives becomes evident (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh167f2">2</xref>A). The most striking observation is that the B<sub>12</sub> box encompasses only a small portion of the conserved sequence and structural domain. The phylogenetic analysis indicates that this complex RNA motif has at least 10 base-paired elements and &#x0223c;57 nucleotide positions whose identity is conserved in &#x0003e;90&#x00025; of the representative sequences.</p><p>The secondary-structure model proposed previously for the riboswitch from <italic>E.coli btuB</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh167c10">10</xref>) corresponds only partially with the new model that is based on phylogenetic data. Specifically, pairing elements P4 (part) and P5 to P8 of the original structural model are retained in the revised model with the modified designations P5 and P8 to P12, respectively (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh167f2">2</xref>B). In addition, the P9 stem from the original model is retained without designation in the revised model, as it resides outside the domain of highest sequence and structural conservation. In contrast, the revised model includes numerous short base-paired elements that explain the role of nucleotides that were left unfolded in the earlier model, and also that preclude formation of certain other pairing possibilities. Specifically, stems P1 to P3, as predicted in the original model, are replaced and supplemented in the revised model by stems P1 to P4, P6, P7 and P10.</p><p>The revised secondary-structure model is similar to a model proposed recently for this same RNA motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh167c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh167c18">18</xref>). Most notably, these two models differ with respect to how the B<sub>12</sub> box is folded, and on the structural details of the bridge between the left and right halves of the <italic>E.coli btuB</italic> aptamer. Several lines of evidence support our revised structural model for the B<sub>12</sub> aptamer. First, the new secondary-structure model is largely consistent with structural probing data that was presented previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh167c10">10</xref>). Likewise, mutational analysis supported the formation of a bridging stem element that is retained in the revised model (P8). Thirdly, representatives within the sequence alignment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh167f1">1</xref>) exhibit considerable sequence covariation within the stem elements that are common to most B<sub>12</sub> riboswitches (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh167f2">2</xref>B), indicating that these pairing elements are important for riboswitch function. Specifically, the covariation in sequences of proposed stems P3 and P6 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh167f1">1</xref>) suggest that these structures are more likely to be formed than the alternative structure proposed recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh167c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh167c18">18</xref>).</p><p>The revised secondary-structure model is more complex than those of other riboswitches. Interestingly, biochemical evidence (see below) suggests that, at least in some cases, RNA constructs that encompass only the minimal aptamer domain are not sufficient to exhibit maximal binding affinity to coenzyme B<sub>12</sub>. These latter results indicate that the more highly conserved portion of the riboswitch might not comprise the complete and fully functional aptamer motif. Thus, the likely involvement of more distal RNA elements (such as a possible pseudoknot interaction between the loop of P5 and downstream sequences) adds even greater complexity to the RNA&#x02019;s structure.</p></sec><sec><title>5&#x02032;-UTRs from the <italic>btuB</italic> and <italic>cob</italic> mRNAs of <italic>S.typhimurium</italic> bind coenzyme B<sub>12</sub></title><p>Like <italic>btuB</italic>, genetic expression of the <italic>cob</italic> mRNA from <italic>S.typhimurium</italic> is known to be regulated by B<sub>12</sub>-related compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh167c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh167c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh167c20">20</xref>). We speculated that the presence of the conserved B<sub>12</sub> box also could be an indication that the mRNA that encodes for the majority of the genes required for <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis of coenzyme B<sub>12</sub> might be negatively regulated by the metabolic end product. Consistent with this hypothesis is the observation that our database search, along with another reported recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh167c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh167c18">18</xref>), for sequence elements with similarity to the B<sub>12</sub> aptamer identified the 5&#x02032;-UTR of the <italic>cob</italic> operon from <italic>S.typhimurium</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh167f1">1</xref>).</p><p>As expected, the 5&#x02032;-UTR from <italic>S.typhimurium btuB</italic> mRNA has considerable sequence and predicted structural similarity to that of the homologous <italic>E.coli</italic> leader (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh167f3">3</xref>A). In contrast, the sequence of the corresponding <italic>cob</italic> 5&#x02032;-UTR varies significantly from that of <italic>btuB</italic>. Furthermore, the secondary-structure model proposed recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh167c14">14</xref>) for the <italic>cob</italic> RNA differs substantially from our model for the coenzyme B<sub>12</sub> aptamer presented in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh167f2">2</xref>. However, we find that the <italic>cob</italic> 5&#x02032;-UTR does carry the consensus sequence elements that are indicative of the B<sub>12</sub> class of riboswitches, despite the considerable sequence differences between the two RNAs. Furthermore, the <italic>cob</italic> 5&#x02032;-UTR can be folded into a secondary structure (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh167f3">3</xref>B) that carries the major features of the B<sub>12</sub> aptamer model (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh167f2">2</xref>A). The differences in sequence and predicted base-pairing potential reside in portions of the RNA that are not conserved through evolution. Thus, the two leader domains from the <italic>btuB</italic> and <italic>cob</italic> mRNAs from <italic>S.typhimurium</italic> each carry a putative ligand binding aptamer domain for a B<sub>12</sub>-dependent riboswitch.</p><p>In-line probing analyses were conducted with fragments of both the <italic>btuB</italic> and <italic>cob</italic> mRNA leader sequences from <italic>S.typhimurium</italic> that correspond to the putative B<sub>12</sub> aptamer domains. As indicated previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh167c10">10</xref>), the <italic>btuB</italic> mRNA undergoes B<sub>12</sub>-dependent structure modulation with a pattern that is similar to that observed for the homologous mRNA from <italic>E.coli</italic> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh167f3">3</xref>C). The data also reveal that substantial ligand-dependent structure modulation occurs with the <italic>cob</italic> mRNA fragment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh167f3">3</xref>D). Upon closer inspection, the spontaneous cleavage patterns for both RNAs correspond well with the revised secondary-structure model for the B<sub>12</sub> aptamer, wherein the sites of modulation largely correlate with conserved bulges and sites of constant high cleavage correlate with the non-conserved loops of stems. Therefore, we conclude that the 5&#x02032;-UTR of the <italic>cob</italic> mRNA directly binds coenzyme B<sub>12</sub> without the participation of protein factors, and that the biosynthetic pathway for this metabolite is regulated, at least in part, by a coenzyme B<sub>12</sub>-responsive riboswitch.</p></sec><sec><title>Ligand-binding affinity varies with the length of the 5&#x02032;-UTR fragment</title><p>The ligand-dependent changes in spontaneous RNA cleavage can be quantitated and used to derive an apparent <italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub> value for ligand&#x02013;aptamer complex formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh167c21">21</xref>).

For example, the thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) aptamers from the <italic>thiM</italic> and <italic>thiC</italic> mRNAs of <italic>E.coli</italic> exhibit the highest affinity for TPP, while larger constructs that carry portions of the expression platform each bind with significantly lower affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh167c4">4</xref>). This is likely due to the presence of competing RNA structures that detract from tight ligand binding by reducing preorganization of the aptamer domain. In other words, the allosteric nature of the full riboswitch element (aptamer plus expression platform) might be expected to result in a poorer equilibrium constant for complex formation with its target ligand due to these dynamic but mutually exclusive folds.</p><p>We examined several RNA constructs that encompass the minimal consensus sequence and structure for the B<sub>12</sub> aptamer to determine whether such molecules might exhibit higher affinity for the coenzyme. Interestingly, the shortened constructs for the two <italic>btuB</italic> RNAs and for the <italic>cob</italic> RNA experience a significant (&#x0003e;100-fold) loss of binding affinity when the riboswitch is trimmed to represent only the conserved aptamer domain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh167f4">4</xref>B). This suggests that sequence or structural element(s) within the presumed non-conserved domain of the riboswitch aid in proper formation of the more highly conserved aptamer.</p><p>In contrast to other instances where extra-consensus sequences detract from binding affinity, the consensus B<sub>12</sub> aptamer domain (at least in some cases) makes productive use of flanking sequences to form an aptamer domain with improved affinity. Previously, we had suggested that a pseudoknot might play an important role in the formation of the B<sub>12</sub> riboswitch structure of <italic>E.coli btuB</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh167c10">10</xref>). This speculative proposal was based on the fact that structural probing data were consistent with such an interaction, although mutational analysis was inconclusive. This proposed pseudoknot, which is depicted as a base pairing interaction between the loop of P5 and the loop of a non-conserved hairpin (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh167f2">2</xref>B), might play a role in supporting the consensus domain in its function as a B<sub>12</sub> aptamer. If true, this putative interaction is not obviously present in all other representatives of the phylogeny examined in this study.</p></sec><sec><title>Confirmation of coenzyme B<sub>12</sub>&#x02013;<italic>cob</italic> RNA interaction by equilibrium dialysis</title><p>Equilibrium dialysis was used to confirm that the <italic>cob</italic> mRNA sequence directly binds coenzyme B<sub>12</sub> in the absence of proteins (data not shown), as had been determined previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh167c10">10</xref>) for the corresponding <italic>btuB</italic> mRNA fragment from <italic>E.coli</italic>. A Scatchard analysis was also carried out for the 386 <italic>cob</italic> RNA by using equilibrium dialysis with various concentrations of tritiated coenzyme B<sub>12</sub> (data not shown). Unfortunately, coenzyme B<sub>12</sub> is highly photo-labile, and the data were not of sufficient quality to establish stoichiometry with confidence.</p><p>Specifically, we found that 27&#x00025; of the tritium in a control equilibrium dialysis assay failed to bind the RNA, which is most likely due to breakdown of the compound during assembly of the assay mixtures, despite taking precautions to minimize exposure to light. The uncertainty with respect to the extent of degradation in each independent equilibrium dialysis run likely contributes scatter in the placement of data points on the Scatchard plot. Although the plot should be interpreted with caution, a best-fit line to the data indicates a dissociation constant for the <italic>cob</italic> aptamer of &#x0223c;200 nM, which is similar to that determined by in-line probing (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh167f4">4</xref>B). The <italic>x</italic> intercept of this line resides between 0.75 and 1, which is most consistent with a 1:1 relationship between ligand and RNA when in complex.</p></sec><sec><title>A variant coenzyme B<sub>12</sub> riboswitch occurs in the <italic>B.subtilis yvrC</italic> mRNA</title><p>The phylogenetic survey of domains that resemble B<sub>12</sub> riboswitches revealed a single example from <italic>B.subtilis</italic> (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh167f1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh167f5">5</xref>A). This representative resides immediately upstream of an apparent four-gene operon that carries the open reading frames (ORFs) <italic>yvrC</italic>, <italic>yvrB</italic>, <italic>yvrA</italic> and <italic>yvqK</italic>. Although the functions of these ORFs remain unproven, the <italic>yvr</italic> genes appear to encode proteins involved in metal import and processing, and thus modulation of their levels of genetic expression in response to coenzyme B<sub>12</sub> concentrations seems reasonable since this coenzyme carries a metal ligand.</p><p>Interestingly, the <italic>B.subtilis</italic> variant is lacking the P8, P10 and P11 helices, which otherwise would present sequence and structural elements that are conserved in most other representatives (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh167f2">2</xref>A). The absence of this highly conserved portion of the B<sub>12</sub> aptamer makes the <italic>yvrC</italic> RNA one of the most extreme variants identified in our phylogenetic analysis. Therefore, we conducted several experiments to determine whether the <italic>yvrC</italic> RNA binds coenzyme B<sub>12</sub> and whether the riboswitch-like domain responds genetically to this effector when appended to a reporter gene.</p><p>Three RNA constructs were created based on the UTR sequence of <italic>B.subtilis yvrC</italic>. The two largest constructs, 259 <italic>yvrC</italic> and 149 <italic>yvrC</italic>, both exhibit structural modulation upon addition of coenzyme B<sub>12</sub>, which indicate that they both retain ligand-binding function (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh167f5">5</xref>B and C) despite the absence of the P8, P10 and P11 helices and the associated conserved nucleotides. However, the 120 <italic>yvrC</italic> construct, which carries only those nucleotides that correspond closely to the left-most portion of the consensus aptamer motif, fails to bind coenzyme B<sub>12</sub> as indicated by the absence of ligand-induced structural modulation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh167f5">5</xref>D).</p><p>This finding suggests that a structural element that is critical for high-affinity binding resides within nucleotides 121 and 149 of the larger <italic>yvrC</italic> constructs. In addition, this result suggests that the B<sub>12</sub> riboswitch might make use of a two-lobed aptamer, where the left and right halves of the RNA form distinct folds that independently recognize different parts of the ligand. In this model, the novel 29-nucleotide domain that forms the 3&#x02032; terminus of 149 <italic>yvrC</italic> might serve as a functional replacement for the absence of stems P8 to P12 that are found in the <italic>E.coli</italic> and <italic>S.typhimurium btuB</italic> RNAs. In a preliminary assessment of this hypothesis, we have examined whether the molecular recognition characteristics of the <italic>yvrC</italic> and <italic>btuB</italic> variants might be different. Specifically, the <italic>yvrC</italic> leader exhibits poorer discrimination against purinyl cobalamin (PurCbl) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh167c10">10</xref>) than does the <italic>btuB</italic> riboswitch from <italic>E.coli</italic> (data not shown). Although other explanations for this observation can be envisioned, it is possible that the right half of the aptamer binds the adenosyl moiety of coenzyme B<sub>12</sub> and that the 29-nucleotide alternative domain from <italic>yvrC</italic> recognizes this moiety somewhat differently.</p><p>The 5&#x02032;-UTR of the <italic>B.subtilis yvrC</italic> mRNA also permits coenzyme B<sub>12</sub>-dependent modulation of a reporter gene when expressed <italic>in vivo</italic>. To assess riboswitch function <italic>in vivo</italic>, a DNA construct carrying the first 275 nucleotides of the <italic>yvrC</italic> sequence (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh167f5">5</xref>A) was appended to a &#x003b2;-galactosidase gene in a transcriptional reporter vector. When integrated into <italic>B.subtilis</italic>, the construct exhibits an &#x0223c;3-fold reduction of &#x003b2;-galactosidase activity when coenzyme B<sub>12</sub> is added to the culture medium. Specifically, Miller units of 142 and 47 were obtained in the absence and presence of B<sub>12</sub> supplementation to the medium, respectively. These findings indicate that the <italic>yvrC</italic> variant is a functional coenzyme B<sub>12</sub>-specific riboswitch, despite its weaker correspondence to the sequence and structure of most other representatives in the phylogeny.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>The established diversity of riboswitches in living systems is continuing to expand as biochemical, genetic and bioinformatic approaches are being applied to find and characterize new examples. Phylogenetic analyses reported herein and elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh167c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh167c18">18</xref>) indicate that the coenzyme B<sub>12</sub> class of riboswitches is widely distributed amongst both Gram- positive and Gram-negative prokaryotes. In addition, our data indicate that RNA domains matching the consensus sequence and structure of this riboswitch class from three different organisms do indeed bind coenzyme B<sub>12</sub> and control gene expression in response to high ligand concentrations.</p><p>In many instances, genes under the control of a coenzyme B<sub>12</sub> riboswitch are involved in the transport of cobalamin compounds or metals, or associated with the biosynthetic pathway for the coenzyme. For example, a coenzyme B<sub>12</sub> riboswitch in <italic>S.typhimurium</italic> modulates expression of the <italic>btuB</italic> gene encoding a cobalamin transport protein, and a second riboswitch of this class serves as a genetic control element for the 25-gene <italic>cob</italic> operon. In certain organisms, these riboswitches control the expression of genes that are more distantly related to the coenzyme. Perhaps most striking is the involvement of coenzyme B<sub>12</sub> riboswitches in the control of ribonucleotide reductases that do not use this coenzyme. Presumably, when this compound is at a sufficiently high concentration, expression of the coenzyme B<sub>12</sub>-independent ribonucleotide reductase is reduced to defer this metabolic activity to the coenzyme B<sub>12</sub>-dependent form of the enzyme.</p><p>The potential complexity of riboswitch structures is also apparent by examining the structural model of the coenzyme B<sub>12</sub> class of riboswitches. In addition to the numerous short helices and conserved sequence elements, long-range RNA interactions likely augment aptamer function, at least in the case of the <italic>btuB</italic> variants examined. Given the widespread distribution of riboswitches, RNA appears to have sufficient structural and functional diversity to perform reliably as genetic control elements for genes involved in critical biological processes. The substantial deviation in consensus sequence and structure exemplified by the <italic>yvrC</italic> RNA and several others indicates that considerable changes in riboswitch structure can occur through evolutionary processes. Although the large-scale alteration of this riboswitch class appears to be somewhat limited, it seems reasonable to speculate that variant riboswitches might exist that respond selectively to closely related metabolites.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkh167f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Sequence alignment of putative coenzyme B<sub>12</sub> riboswitches.
