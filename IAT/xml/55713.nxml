Diploid cells of fission yeast produce haploid cells through a developmental program of sporulation, which consists of meiosis and spore morphogenesis. The process of meiosis includes DNA replication, recombination and chromosome segregation. Unlike the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, fission yeast cells are most stable in the haploid state and are essentially asexual under rich nutritional conditions. The initiation of meiosis in fission yeast is known to be under the control of two independent, convergent regulatory pathways, i.e., the mating types and nutritional condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke354c1">1</xref>). Fission yeast displays two mating types, <italic>h</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> and <italic>h</italic><italic><sup>&#x02013;</sup></italic>, and the haploid cells with distinct mating types form zygotes, undergo meiosis and generate haploid spores when cells are starved of nutrients, especially nitrogen. Unlike budding yeast, glucose starvation is not mandatory for mating and meiosis. When these spores are returned to rich nutritional conditions, they keep growing and do not undergo conjugation unless they are starved of nutrients. Zygotes can also grow as diploid cells if they are put on a rich medium immediately after conjugation. These diploid cells can also proceed to meiosis when they are starved of nitrogen.</p><p> A number of the genes that are required for these events have been cloned and their function during meiosis and&#x0002f;or sporulation analyzed. Many of the genes exhibit elevated levels of transcription only during the meiotic process, not during the vegetative growth phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke354c2">2</xref>). Compared to the mitotic cell cycle, however, only a limited amount of information is available on the regulatory mechanisms of meiosis or sporulation at a molecular level. This is partly because the number of meiosis- or sporulation-specific genes that have been isolated up until now remains small. To alleviate this problem, genes whose expression was specifically induced during meiosis and sporulation have been isolated on the assumption that many of them will be related to the regulation of these processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke354c3">3</xref>). However, primarily because of technical problems, only a limited number of such genes have been isolated so far. We have recently developed a novel protocol for the preparation of a subtracted cDNA library of high quality that permits comprehensive cloning from the library between two kinds of closely related cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke354c4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke354c7">7</xref>). In this study, we prepared a subtracted cDNA library from <italic>S.pombe</italic> using this technique and have isolated 31 types of clones whose expression was induced during meiosis. We report here the characterization of their gene products.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Strains and media</title><p>We used CD16-1 (<italic>h</italic><italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup></italic><italic>&#x0002f;h</italic><italic><sup>&#x02013;</sup></italic><italic>ade6M-210&#x0002f;ade6-M216 cyh1&#x0002f;&#x0002b; &#x0002b;&#x0002f;lys5-391</italic>) and CD16-5 (<italic>h</italic><italic><sup>&#x02013;</sup></italic><italic>&#x0002f;h</italic><italic><sup>&#x02013;</sup></italic><italic>ade6-M210&#x0002f;ade6-M216 cyh1&#x0002f;&#x0002b; &#x0002b;&#x0002f;lys5-391</italic>) strains for RNA preparation for use in northern blot analysis, cDNA library construction and cDNA subtraction. To examine <italic>mei4</italic><italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup></italic> dependency, we used the temperature-sensitive mutant <italic>pat-1-114</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke354c8">8</xref>) and the <italic>pat-1-114 mei4-</italic>null double mutant strain for RNA preparation for use in northern blot analysis.

The yeast cells were grown in a standard rich medium (YPD or YEA) or in a synthetic medium (EMM2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke354c9">9</xref>). For induction of mating and meiosis, cells were cultured in EMM-N medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke354c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke354c10">10</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Preparation of the subtracted cDNA library</title><p>CD16-1 cells were directed to meiosis as described above and collected at 1 h intervals (1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 h). For mRNA preparation, cells were mixed and disrupted by glass beads in the presence of 5.5 M guanidine thiocyanate, 25 mM sodium citrate, 0.5&#x00025; sodium lauryl sarcosinate and 0.2 M 2-mercaptoethanol. From this mixture, mRNA was prepared and the cDNA library was constructed by a linker-primer method using the pAP3neo vector as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke354c4">4</xref>). This cDNA library was changed to the single-stranded DNA form with the aid of the R408 helper phage. To isolate recombinant phage, the bacteria were removed by two rounds of centrifugation at 17 000 <italic>g</italic> at 4&#x000b0;C for 15 min, then cleared through a 0.22&#x000a0;&#x000b5;m sterile filter. To remove contaminating <italic>Escherichia coli </italic>DNA, 25 ml of the supernatant was incubated at room temperature for 3 h with 10 U&#x0002f;ml of DNase I. Subsequently, the phage was precipitated by adjusting the solution to 4&#x00025; polyethylene glycol and 0.5 M NaCl. After incubation for 20&#x000a0;min at room temperature, the mixture was centrifuged at 17&#x000a0;000 <italic>g</italic> at 4&#x000b0;C, and the pellet was resuspended in 400 &#x000b5;l of TE (10 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA). To obtain phage DNA, the phage protein was digested with 50 &#x000b5;g of proteinase K by incubation at 42&#x000b0;C for 1 h in the presence of 0.1&#x00025; SDS. The single-stranded phage DNA was extracted by phenol&#x0002f;chloroform three times and the ethanol-precipitated DNA was pelleted and dissolved in 20 &#x000b5;l of TE and stored at &#x02013;20&#x000b0;C before use.</p><p> CD16-5 cells were also directed to meiosis, and poly(A)<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> RNA (mRNA) was extracted from cells collected at 1 h intervals (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 h). mRNA (10 &#x000b5;g) was dissolved in 20 &#x000b5;l of H<sub>2</sub>O and mixed with 30 &#x000b5;l of a 1 &#x000b5;g&#x0002f;&#x000b5;l solution of Photoprobe biotin (VECTOR Laboratories, Burlingame). To label the mRNA with biotin, the solution was irradiated on ice for 20 min using a sun lamp at a height of 10 cm. Then 50 &#x000b5;l of 0.1 M Tris&#x02013;HCl pH9.5&#x0002f;1 mM EDTA was added, and the solution was extracted three times with water-saturated 2-butanol and twice with chloroform. After ethanol precipitation, the mRNA pellet was resuspended in 20 &#x000b5;l of H<sub>2</sub>O. To increase the density of the biotin residues, the biotinylation step was repeated twice. This photobiotinylated RNA (5 &#x000b5;g) and 1 &#x000b5;g single-stranded DNA were mixed in a hybridization mixture containing 25 &#x000b5;l 40&#x00025; formamide, 50 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 1&#x000a0;mM EDTA, 0.1&#x00025; SDS and 0.2 M NaCl. To prevent non-specific hybridization between regions of poly(A) in the single-stranded DNA and the biotinylated mRNA, 1 &#x000b5;g of polyadenylic acid (Pharmacia) was also added. The reaction mixture was placed in a FUNA-PCR tube (Funakoshi, Tokyo), heated at 65&#x000b0;C for 10 min, then incubated at 42&#x000b0;C for 48 h.</p><p> After hybridization, the biotinylated RNA and DNA hybrids were removed using 10 &#x000b5;g of streptavidin (Gibco BRL) as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke354c4">4</xref>). To change the recovered single-stranded DNA to a double-stranded form, the single-stranded DNA dissolved in 20 &#x000b5;l of H<sub>2</sub>O was mixed with 10 &#x000b5;l of the primer oligonucleotide (5&#x02032;-GGAAGTGTTACTTCTGCTCT-3&#x02032;; 20 ng&#x0002f;&#x000b5;l). The solution was heated at 65&#x000b0;C for 10 min and incubated at room temperature for 5 min to anneal the oligonucleotide. A primer extension reaction was then performed in 40&#x000a0;&#x000b5;l of extension buffer containing the annealing reaction product, 20 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl pH 8.5, 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 250 &#x000b5;M dATP, dTTP, dGTP and dCTP, and 4 U of <italic>Bca</italic>BEST DNA polymerase (TaKaRa). The reaction was stopped by heating the mixture at 65&#x000b0;C for 1 h, and the products were subjected to electroporation into the MC1061A strain of <italic>E.coli,</italic> according to the protocol we reported previously, to attain a maximum transformation efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke354c11">11</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Northern blot and genomic Southern analyses</title><p>To obtain RNA from cells in meiosis, CD16-1 and CD16-5 cells were shaken at 30&#x000b0;C in EMM2 medium containing nitrogen until they reached log phase (1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>7</sup>cells&#x0002f;ml) and then transferred into EMM2 medium without nitrogen and incubated under the same conditions. Cells were collected at 2 h intervals (for CD16-1, 0&#x02013;12 h; for CD16-5, 0&#x02013;10 h), mixed with 10&#x00025; SDS, phenol&#x0002f;chloroform and RNA extraction buffer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke354c9">9</xref>), and disrupted by glass beads (&#x003c6; &#x0003d; 0.5 mm).

We took advantage of the fact that heterozygous diploid cells of distinct mating types (<italic>h</italic><italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup></italic>&#x0002f;<italic>h</italic><italic><sup>&#x02013;</sup></italic>) can be induced to initiate meiosis after nitrogen starvation, whereas homozygous diploid cells with the same mating type (<italic>h</italic><italic><sup>&#x02013;</sup></italic>&#x0002f;<italic>h</italic><italic><sup>&#x02013;</sup></italic>) never proceed to meiosis. Thus, we used two kinds of diploid strains, CD16-1 and CD16-5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke354c16">16</xref>) for subtraction. Upon nitrogen starvation, the heterozygous CD16-1 strain initiates meiosis, while the homozygous CD16-5 strain cannot proceed to meiosis. We confirmed this by counting the frequency of cells carrying one to four nuclei by staining the cells with Hoechst33342 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke354f1">1</xref>A).</p><p> We first prepared mRNA from CD16-1 cells that were collected at 1 h intervals (1&#x02013;6 h) and pooled from the sporulation medium following nitrogen starvation. Using this mRNA sample, we prepared a cDNA library of 1.8 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> c.f.u. with an average insert size of 1.5 kb in a pAP3neo vector, which was designed to be converted to a single-stranded form by transfection with f1 helper phage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke354c4">4</xref>). The number of independent clones in the original cDNA library was considered to be large enough to minimize the loss of the desired clones. In parallel with these experiments, we prepared mRNA from CD16-5 cells that were collected at 1 h intervals (0&#x02013;8 h) after nitrogen starvation and pooled before mRNA preparation. This mRNA was labeled with biotin using the photobiotin system, and then mixed in excess in the hybridization buffer with the single-stranded form of the cDNA library from CD16-1 cells. After two rounds of subtractive hybridization, the single-stranded form of the subtracted cDNA library was converted to the double-stranded form by<italic> Bca</italic>BEST DNA polymerase (TaKaRa Shuzo, Japan) and transfected <italic>E.coli</italic> (MC1061A strain) by electroporation according to a protocol that maximizes the efficiency of transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke354c11">11</xref>). Thus, we constructed a subtracted cDNA library of 1.2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup> c.f.u. (average insert size &#x0003d; 1.45 kb). The number of independent clones in the subtracted cDNA library was again judged to be large enough to cover almost all of the clones whose expression would be increased in CD16-1 cells after nitrogen starvation.</p></sec><sec><title>Isolation of meiosis- or sporulation-specific genes</title><p>The quality of this subtracted cDNA library was estimated as follows. First, we prepared plasmid DNA from randomly selected clones from the library, and investigated the size distribution of the cDNA inserts by digesting them with <italic>Eco</italic>RI and <italic>Not</italic>I restriction enzymes, whose digestion sites were situated in the multicloning site of the pAP3neo vector. Examination of their sizes by agarose gel electrophoresis revealed that almost all of the plasmids contained cDNA inserts &#x0003e;100&#x000a0;bp, and that their size distribution was variable among the cDNA clones examined. The result suggested that the subtracted cDNA library contained sufficiently diverse clones to cover most of the cDNA species we desired to isolate. Therefore, we subjected this subtracted cDNA library to further analysis.</p><p> Next we cut cDNA inserts longer than 300 bp with <italic>Eco</italic>RI&#x02013;<italic>Not</italic>I, purified the fragments by agarose gel electrophoresis, radiolabeled them with &#x0005b;&#x003b1;-<sup>32</sup>P&#x0005d;dCTP and performed northern blot analyses (see Materials and Methods). In the northern blots, RNA samples taken at 2 h intervals from both CD16-1 and CD16-5 cells during the time course of incubation in the sporulation medium were loaded in each lane as shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke354f1">1</xref>B. By northern blot analysis we expected to detect the cDNA clones from the subtracted cDNA library whose expression would be induced in CD16-1 cells during the time course of meiosis, but not in CD16-5 cells. We also sequenced &#x0223c;1 kb of DNA from the 5&#x02032; ends of the clones and found that most of the cDNA clones possessed distinct DNA sequences; this suggested that the redundancy of the cDNA component was very small.</p><p> We performed northern blot analyses of several hundred clones that were randomly isolated from the cDNA library. We found that the intensity of the bands for 80 clones displayed a band pattern whose intensity was abruptly increased at a certain stage of the meiotic process in CD16-1 cells; no band was observed before the induction of meiosis at 0 h. Since cells at 0 h are in the mitotic phase, the absence of a band implies that these genes are not expressed at the mitotic phase of the cell cycle, i.e., they are expressed in a meiosis-specific manner. In contrast, no band was detected throughout the time course of meiosis in CD16-5 cells, indicating that the bands appearing in CD16-1 cells are not due to nitrogen starvation but caused by progression into meiosis. We named these cDNA clones <italic>meu</italic> after meiotic expression upregulated. The DNA sequences of these cDNA clones revealed that they were independent clones except for the <italic>meu1</italic><italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup></italic><italic>&#x0002f;meu2</italic><italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup></italic>, <italic>meu3</italic><italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup></italic> and <italic>meu4</italic><italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup></italic> cDNAs, which were isolated twice, three times and seven times, respectively. Thus, we isolated 31 types of <italic>meu</italic> cDNA clones.</p></sec><sec><title>Some <italic>meu</italic> genes encode identical or homologous proteins</title><p>Homology searches for these <italic>meu</italic> genes in the non-redundant database using the BLAST network service (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http:&#x0002f;&#x0002f;www.genome.ad.jp&#x0002f;">http:&#x0002f;&#x0002f;www.genome.ad.jp&#x0002f;</ext-link>) revealed that most of them were uncharacterized novel genes.

In order to learn more about its regulation, we isolated a large number of cDNA clones from <italic>S.pombe</italic> whose expression was upregulated during meiosis induced by nitrogen starvation. The isolation of such genes has been performed on the assumption that many such genes may be related to the regulation of meiosis. However, some genes induced by nitrogen starvation may be irrelevant to meiosis. To remove these unwanted genes, we employed a strategy of cDNA subtraction between mating types that respond differently to nitrogen starvation: namely, the heterozygous diploid (<italic>h</italic><italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup></italic>&#x0002f;<italic>h</italic><italic><sup>&#x02013;</sup></italic>) strain (CD16-1), which can initiate meiosis, and the homozygous diploid (<italic>h</italic><italic><sup>&#x02013;</sup></italic>&#x0002f;<italic>h</italic><italic><sup>&#x02013;</sup></italic>) strain (CD16-5), which cannot proceed to meiosis. To prevent loss of the desired clones from the cDNA library during the cDNA library preparation and subtractions, we kept the complexity of the cDNA inserts in the library above 10 times the expected number of cDNA species to be isolated. In <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic>, genetic and biochemical analysis has identified about 150 different genes that are specifically expressed during meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke354c29">29</xref>), and microarray experiments have identified about 500 genes that are either weakly or strongly induced during meiosis and sporulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke354c30">30</xref>). Considering these results, we expected that the number of genes in the <italic>S.pombe</italic> genome would be &#x0003c;10 000, and that there would be &#x0003c;1000 meiosis-specific genes. The average size of the cDNA inserts was also considered to be important for manipulation and subsequent analysis of the isolated clones. With these assumptions in mind, a complexity of 1.8 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> c.f.u. for the meiosis-oriented cDNA library (CD16-1) with an average insert size of 1.5 kb, and a complexity of 1.2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup> c.f.u. for the meiosis-specific subtracted cDNA library (CD16-1 minus CD16-5) with an average insert size of 1.45 kb were well above the required level. Northern blot analysis using randomly selected cDNA clones from the subtracted cDNA library as probes indicated that the transcription of nearly 10&#x00025; of the genes in the library was induced following nitrogen starvation, and the intensity of the bands was stronger in the CD16-1 cells than those of the CD16-5 cells (data not shown). DNA sequencing of &#x0223c;1 kb from the 5&#x02032; ends of each isolated cDNA clone indicated that they were derived from distinct genes, suggesting that the redundancy of the cDNA component in this subtracted cDNA library was very small. This equalized property signifies that isolation of such clones can be efficiently performed using this subtracted cDNA library. High scores of complexity and insert sizes imply that we have concentrated a large number of meiosis- or sporulation-specific cDNA clones in our subtracted cDNA library. Sequence homology searches with the isolated <italic>meu</italic> cDNA clones over the entire genome of <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> revealed that less than half of them have a homolog. Homology searches also indicated that most of these <italic>S.pombe</italic>-specific genes had no homolog in the genomes of other species. These results indicate that the genes involved in meiosis are highly species-specific.</p></sec><sec><title>Some <italic>meu</italic> genes encode non-coding RNA</title><p>It is noteworthy that some of the <italic>meu</italic> cDNA clones had no apparent CDS. Stable hairpin formation found in the whole molecules of these gene products suggests that these genes may generate non-coding RNA molecules. Meiosis in <italic>S.pombe</italic> is known to be regulated by cooperation of a functional RNA and an RNA binding protein. For example, <italic>mei2</italic><italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup></italic>, an essential gene for the initiation of premeiotic DNA synthesis and meiosis I, encodes an RNA binding protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke354c31">31</xref>).

The Mei2&#x02013;meiRNA complex seems to function only at meiosis I. Another RNA species forming a complex with Mei2 to promote premeiotic DNA synthesis remains to be found. Expression of the functional <italic>mes1</italic><italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup></italic> product that is essential for meiosis II may also be regulated by meiosis-specific splicing with the aid of Mei2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke354c33">33</xref>).

This result suggests that Meu16 RNA may function as an antisense RNA for these two genes. It has been reported that antisense RNAs may function as repressors of sense RNA. In <italic>C.elegans</italic>, a small non-coding RNA called <italic>let-4</italic> RNA is involved in the determination of developmental timing, and is expressed as an antisense RNA from the 3&#x02032; untranslated region of <italic>lin-14</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke354c34">34</xref>). The expression levels of the LIN-14 protein are decreased by <italic>let-4 </italic>RNA expression at the end of the first larval stage. On the other hand, the expression of <italic>lin-14</italic> mRNA was unchanged, which implies that the repression of<italic> lin-14</italic> expression occurs after its transcription.

Rad24 also functions as an inhibitor in the regulation of the Mei2 protein, which plays an essential role in the progression of meiosis after nitrogen starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke354c38">38</xref>).
