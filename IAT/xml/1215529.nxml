The role of this virus in the series of events leading to the onset of HCC has remained elusive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. However, it has been suggested that the smallest protein encoded by the HBV genome, HBX, is involved in the development of HCC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>Several proteins have been demonstrated to interact with the HBX protein through the use of the Yeast Two Hybrid system. These include the C-terminal portion of a novel human proteasome alpha subunit which possesses a protein sequence of close relationship to that of the 28 kD subunits from other organisms; PSMA7, the &#x003b1;-subunit of the 20S proteasome complex; PSMC1, the subunit of the 19S proteasome regulatory cap complex; XAPC7, a highly conserved proteasome subunit belonging to the &#x003b1;-subunit of the 20S proteasome complex. PSMA7, PSMC1 and XAPC7 were demonstrated to interact with the second Kunitz-type domain of the HBX protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Another two proteins, XAP2 (X-associated protein 2) and XIP (HBX-interacting protein) were found to be negative regulators of HBX. Overexpression of XAP2 abolished the transactivating function of HBX while the specific interaction of XIP to the carboxy terminus of HBX in differentiated HCC cells led to a reduction of wild-type HBV viral replication to levels similar to that observed after transfection with HBX-minus virus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>HBX was also shown to interact with XAP-1 (X-associated protein 1), a human homolog of the monkey UV-damaged DNA-binding protein (UV-DDB) which might be involved in DNA repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Besides these, HBX was able to interact and colocalise with HVDAC3 to the mitochondria, resulting in decreased mitochondrial transmembrane potential. HVDAC3 was identified as a new member of the human voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) family that provides pathways for ATP and metabolites across the mitochondrial membrane. It constitutes part of the permeability transition pore complex in the mitochondral membrane which regulates mitochondrial transmembrane potential and cytochrome c release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>However, these reported HBX interacting proteins have all been isolated from normal liver cDNA library (cells that had not been exposed to HBV), which may reflect physical but physiologically not meaningful interactions. There is therefore a need to comprehensively isolate and characterize, in a HBV-infected environment, cellular proteins interacting with the widely studied HBX.</p><p>Such an environment has previously been generated in vitro, firstly by showing that clonal cells derived from HepG2 transfected with a HBV-containing plasmid could elicit acute hepatitis in chimpanzees through secretion of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) particles and virions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], and later by our investigation indicating the production of HBV particles in culture medium of HepG2 cells transfected with a replication competent HBV genome cloned in a mammalian expression vector [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>The aim of this study is to isolate cellular proteins interacting with HBX in an HBV-infected environment.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec><title>Infection of HepG2 Cells by Replicative HBV Genome: an ELISA Analysis</title><p>The culture medium of the HepG2 cells transfected with infective HBV genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] was assayed for the presence of HBsAg prior to cell harvesting for RNA extraction. In Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>, values D1, E1, F1, G1, H1, A2, B2, C2, D2, E2, F2, G2 and H2 corresponded respectively to the undiluted medium, its 10&#x000d7;, 10<sup>2</sup>&#x000d7;, 10<sup>3</sup>&#x000d7;, 10<sup>4</sup>&#x000d7;, 10<sup>5</sup>&#x000d7;, 10<sup>6</sup>&#x000d7;, 10<sup>7</sup>&#x000d7;, 10<sup>8</sup>&#x000d7;, 10<sup>9</sup>&#x000d7;, 10<sup>10</sup>&#x000d7;, 10<sup>11</sup>&#x000d7;, 10<sup>12</sup>&#x000d7; serial dilutions measured at an absorbance of 450 nm. The presence of HBsAg was indicated in the undiluted medium, its 10 &#x000d7; dilution and up to 10<sup>4 </sup>&#x000d7; dilution. The values of these samples were respectively, 2.393, 0.464 and down to 0.186. They exceeded the calculated cut-off of 0.179, thus indicating the presence of HBsAg. The results of this assay run were valid as the criteria for the quality control had been met. The mean A<sub>450 </sub>of the negative controls was 0.129, which did not exceed 0.2. The A<sub>450 </sub>of the positive control was 1.494, which was 1.365 higher than the mean A<sub>450 </sub>of the negative controls. The value of the positive control fulfilled the quality control criteria which requires the value to be at least 0.8 higher. The cut-off of the assay reading, 0.179, was derived by adding 0.05 to the mean A<sub>450 </sub>of the negative controls. Based on this cut-off value, readings that were equivalent to or higher than 0.179 indicated reactive samples. Taken together, our results indicated the presence of viral infection process in HepG2 cells transfected with the replicative HBV genome.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Production of HBV in Transfected HepG2 Cells by ELISA Analysis</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left">Wells</td><td align="left">Samples</td><td align="left">Absorbance at 450 nm (A<sub>450</sub>)</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">A1</td><td align="left">Negative Control 1</td><td align="left">0.131</td></tr><tr><td align="left">A2</td><td align="left">Negative Control 2</td><td align="left">0.126</td></tr><tr><td align="left">A3</td><td align="left">Positive Control</td><td align="left">1.494</td></tr><tr><td align="left">A4</td><td align="left">Undiluted growth medium of HBV-transfected HepG2 cells</td><td align="left">2.393</td></tr><tr><td align="left">A5</td><td align="left">10 &#x000d7; diluted growth medium</td><td align="left">0.464</td></tr><tr><td align="left">A6</td><td align="left">10<sup>2 </sup>&#x000d7; diluted growth medium</td><td align="left">0.164</td></tr><tr><td align="left">A7</td><td align="left">10<sup>3 </sup>&#x000d7; diluted growth medium</td><td align="left">0.142</td></tr><tr><td align="left">A8</td><td align="left">10<sup>4 </sup>&#x000d7; diluted growth medium</td><td align="left">0.186</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></sec><sec><title>cDNA Library Construction</title><p>The cDNA library that would be used in the yeast-two-hybrid screening for protein-protein interactions was constructed by simultaneous transformation of double-stranded cDNA and the activation domain vector, pGADT7-Rec, into yeast strain AH109.

Therefore, it can be concluded that the X-&#x003b1;-Galactosidase assay is a reliable method for determining positive interactions in the yeast-two-hybrid system. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>, the HBX bait alone did not activate transcription of the reporter gene that led to blue colour development. This confirms that the blue colonies which resulted after screening were indeed due to interactions between the AD fusion protein and the BD fusion protein in the two separate yeast strains.</p><p>Through the analysis of sequences of 9 positive clones, only one had a library insert that was in frame with the activation domain of GAL4 protein on pGADT7-Rec vector. The insert corresponded to human guanine nucleotide binding protein &#x003b2; subunit 5L (GN&#x003b2;5). Although it has been well established that HBX interacts with many molecules of cellular signaling pathway, GN&#x003b2;5 has hitherto not been identified as a HBX-interacting protein. The use of a cDNA library constructed from HBV-transfected HepG2 cells would therefore be significant in that it would enable cellular signaling events occurring after HBV infection to be traced via interactions with the HBX protein which had been implicated in HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma. This also implies that the use of an infected library increases the likelihood of identifying new interacting partners.</p><p>Despite the stringency of nutritional selection through the use of the AH109 yeast strain which contains three reporters, namely, <italic>ADE2</italic>, <italic>HIS3 </italic>and <italic>MEL1</italic>, the yeast-two-hybrid system is only able to reduce the number of false positives. There still exists an uncertainty of whether interactions are always true positives. For this reason, the Mammalian-Two-Hybrid system was used to re-confirm the interaction. This system verifies protein-protein interactions by transcriptional activation. Similar to the yeast two hybrid system, the Mammalian-Two-Hybrid Checkmate system consists of two vectors namely pBIND and pACT. Interaction between two proteins expressed from these two vectors will be assessed by the luciferase activity following the transient transfection of both vectors into mammalian cells.</p><p>The pBIND-GN&#x003b2;5 plasmid was transfected together with the pACT-HBX plasmid and the pG5luc luciferase vector to test the protein-protein interaction between partial GN&#x003b2;5 sequence and full-length HBX in the Mammalian-Two-Hybrid system. The percentage activity as reflected by the luciferase reporter was plotted out in the graph shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>. The assay value given by this interaction was compared against the positive control nteraction between pACT-MyoD and pBIND-1d and a negative control which included pBIND-GN&#x003b2;5 and the empty pACT vector. The results showed that the luciferase activity triggered by interaction between the partial GN&#x003b2;5 and full length HBX was twenty percent higher than that produced by the negative control reaction, thus suggesting presence of interaction. However, the luciferase activity of the interaction was only 63% of that measured for the interaction in the positive control. Thus, although the experimental value exceeds that of the negative control, the confirmation of the interaction between HBX and partial GN&#x003b2;5 can be fine tuned by further tests using the same system.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay demonstrating the interaction between GN&#x003b2;5 and HBX</bold>.

They are peripherally associated with the plasma membrane and function to couple signals to seven transmembrane-spanning surface receptors. G proteins consist of &#x003b1;, &#x003b2; and &#x003b3; subunits, of which &#x003b2; and &#x003b3; subunits are tightly associated. In a typical G protein coupled signaling pathway, the ligand-activated receptor catalyzes the exchange of guanine nucleotides in the &#x003b1; subunit. The GTP-bound &#x003b1; subunit dissociates from the receptor as well as the &#x003b2;&#x003b3; subunit and proceeds to activate its respective effector molecule. The free &#x003b2;&#x003b3; subunit also activates a similar or different effector molecules.</p><p>The hydrolysis of the bound-GTP to GDP by intrinsic GTPase activity of the &#x003b1; subunit leads to a conformational switch, resulting in the termination of its effector interaction. The resulting &#x003b1;-GDP re-associates with the free &#x003b2;&#x003b3; subunit. This is followed by re-entry of the newly formed heterotrimer into the signaling cycle. To date, 17 &#x003b1; subunits, five &#x003b2; subunits and 12 &#x003b3; subunits have been identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>The GN&#x003b2;5 isolated in our study would be of significance. Previous reports had suggested that the GN&#x003b2;5 protein was essentially soluble. The GN&#x003b2;5 protein displays sequence homology to a group of G&#x003b2;-like proteins known as the WD-40 repeat family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. It has been proposed that this repeat enables G protein &#x003b2; subunits to adopt multiple conformations which could greatly expand the number of signaling partners.</p></sec><sec><title>G proteins and Cancer Development</title><p>G proteins have also been implicated in cancer development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In the classical paradigm, GPCR-mediated signal transduction involves the agonist-dependent interaction of GPCRs with G proteins at the plasma membrane, and the subsequent generation of soluble second messengers or ion currents by membrane localized effectors.</p><p>There exist two major mechanisms for transmembrane signaling in intercellular communication, mediated respectively by receptor tyrosine kinases and by GPCRs. Recent evidence shows that the two pathways can converge on the same effectors, for example, Ras and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK). Both systems appear to use specific protein-protein interactions for localization of key signaling intermediates to appropriate membrane compartments. For receptor tyrosine kinases, protein-protein interactions are mediated by Src homology SH2 and SH3 while for GPCRs, interaction of the &#x003b2;&#x003b3; complex of heterotrimeric G proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>Based on the above, HBX probably associates with GN&#x003b2;5 at the early cellular stage of HBV infection. From previous reports that Ras and MAPK constitute the point of convergence of the tyrosine kinase and the G protein coupled receptor signaling pathways, it is likely that HBX plays a role in bridging and activating the Src-kinase and MAPK mediated pathways at the early stage of viral infection. Further functional studies, including the down-regulation of expression of GN&#x003b2;5 using siRNA, should shed new lights on its role in HBV infection.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell Culture and Transfection</title><p>HepG2 cells were grown in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) (Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum.

This was followed by a 10 minute-incubation period at 25&#x000b0;C and a 10 minute-incubation period at 42&#x000b0;C. 1 &#x003bc;l of SMART III Oligonucleotide (10 &#x003bc;M; 5'AAGCAGTGGTATCAACGCAGAGTGGCCATTATGGCCGGG-3') was addedand the reaction mixtures were incubated at 42&#x000b0;C for 1 hour. The tube was incubated at 75&#x000b0;C for10 minutes to terminate first-strand synthesis and cooled to room temperature before adding 1 &#x003bc;l (2 units) of RNaseH. Next, incubation at 37&#x000b0;C was carried out for 20 minutes. Second strand cDNA was synthesised by Long Distance-PCR. Sufficient double-stranded cDNA was prepared for transformation by setting up two 100 &#x003bc;l reaction mixtures, each composed of the following: 2 &#x003bc;l of first-strand cDNA, 70 &#x003bc;l of deionised water, 10 &#x003bc;l of 10 &#x000d7; Advantage 2 PCR Buffer, 2 &#x003bc;l of 50 &#x000d7; dNTP mix, 2 &#x003bc;l of 5' PCR Buffer, 2 &#x003bc;l of 3' PCR Buffer, 10 &#x003bc;l of GC-Melt Solution and 2 &#x003bc;l of 50 &#x000d7; Advantage 2 Polymerase Mix. Thermal cycling was carried out using the following conditions: 95&#x000b0;C for 30 seconds; 24 cycles of 95&#x000b0;C for 10 seconds, each followed by 68&#x000b0;C for {6 minutes + [5(x)] seconds} where x increased per cycle from "0, 1, 2, 3,..." to 23; 68&#x000b0;C for 5 minutes. Double-stranded cDNA was column-purified using CHROMA SPIN + TE - 400 columns (Clontech Laboratories, Inc.).</p><p>200 &#x003bc;l of AH 109 yeast competent cells (BD Biosciences) was transformed with 14 &#x003bc;l of ds cDNA and 6 &#x003bc;l of pGADT7-Rec. The transformation mixture was distributed onto 130 100 mm SD/-Leu agar plates. The plates were incubated at 30&#x000b0;C for 5 days.</p></sec><sec><title>Harvesting of Yeast Transformants</title><p>1 litre of freezing medium (YPD medium with 25% v/v glycerol and sterilised at 121&#x000b0;C for 15 minutes) was prepared for the harvest of transformants. 5 ml of freezing medium was added to each plate and yeast colonies were scraped off the plates and pooled into a sterile 1 litre conical flask. The mixture was mixed well by swirling the flask before storing as 1 ml aliquots at -80&#x000b0;C.</p></sec><sec><title>Interaction of Yeast Strains</title><p>A single yeast colony from the transformation of the bait plasmid into Y187 yeast strain was innoculated into 50 ml of SD/-Trp liquid medium and incubated at 30&#x000b0;C with shaking at 270 rpm. When OD<sub>600 </sub>of the culture reached 0.8, it was combined with an 1 ml aliquot of the cDNA library in a 1-litre conical flask together with 45 ml of yeast culture medium (2 &#x000d7; YPDA medium with Kanamycin, 50 &#x003bc;g/ml). The mixture was incubated for 24 hours at 30&#x000b0;C with gentle swirling at 40 rpm.</p><p>A drop of the mixture was analysed under phase-contrast microscope (400&#x000d7;) to check for the presence of zygotes. Centrifugation of the mixture was carried out at 1000 &#x000d7; g for 10 minutes and the supernatant was discarded. The cell pellet was resuspended in 10 ml of 0.5 &#x000d7; YPDA/Kanamycin (50 &#x003bc;g/ml). The entire mixture was plated out onto 100 mm SD/-Ade/-His/-Leu/-Trp agar plates. 100 &#x003bc;l of the suspension was distributed evenly onto each plate. The plates were incubated at 30&#x000b0;C for 5 days.</p></sec><sec><title>Selection of Yeast Diploids Expressing Interacting Proteins</title><p>Only colonies that measured 2 mm or more after 5 days of incubation at 30&#x000b0;C were selected for further screening. 60 colonies were randomly selected for the first round of screening. These were streaked onto SD/-Leu/X-&#x003b1;-Gal agar plates. The agar plates were incubated at 30&#x000b0;C over a 4-day incubation period. 52 colonies that turned blue at the end of the 4-day incubation period on the SD/-Leu/X-&#x003b1;-Gal agar plates were individually innoculated into 10 ml of SD/-Leu medium and 5 ml of SD/-Ade/-His/-Leu/-Trp medium. The liquid cultures were incubated with shaking at 30&#x000b0;C, 280 rpm. After 48 hours, glycerol stocks of these cultures were prepared by adding 1.4 ml of each culture to 0.3 ml of glycerol and 0.3 ml of the respective medium. The stocks were stored at -80&#x000b0;C. The SD/-Leu cultures were centrifuged at 5500 rpm, 4&#x000b0;C, for 10 minutes. Yeast plasmid extraction was carried out to determine library insert sizes. 2 &#x003bc;l of extracted plasmid was used as template for PCR. 52 samples corresponding to bands with sizes of approximately 500 basepairs or more were purified using PCR purification columns (QIAGEN) and sequenced. These 52 colonies were also streaked onto SD/-Trp/X-&#x003b1;-Gal agar plates in a grid-like pattern. The following plasmids, the pGBKT7 vector, pGBKT7 cloned with full-length HBX and the pGBKT7-Lamin negative control vector (BD Biosciences) were transformed into Y187. The resulting colonies were used as controls. The agar plates were incubated at 30&#x000b0;C and the rate at which the colonies turned blue over a 4-day incubation period was noted.</p></sec><sec><title>Confirmation of Interaction by Mammalian CheckMate System</title><p>The partial human guanine nucleotide binding protein &#x003b2; subunit 5L (GN&#x003b2;5) insert was amplified for cloning in-frame with the GAL 4 containing binding domain vector, pBIND (CheckMate System, Promega) for use in the Mammalian-two-hybrid system.
