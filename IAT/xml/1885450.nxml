Since a VEGFR1-specific ligand, placenta growth factor (PGF), did not, as expected, inhibit the breast cancer cell apoptosis induced by siVEGF, and since VEGFR1 antibody also had no effects on the survival of these cells, we examined VEGFR1 localization. VEGFR1 was predominantly expressed internally in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 breast cancer cells. Specifically, VEGFR1 was found to be colocalized with lamin A/C and was expressed mainly in the nuclear envelope in breast cancer cell lines and primary breast cancer tumors.

Most of these women live for many years after their diagnosis and many are cured of their cancer. However, sometimes the cancer grows inexorably and spreads (metastasizes) around the body despite the efforts of oncologists. Characteristics of the tumor known as prognostic factors can indicate whether this spreading is likely to happen. Large tumors that have metastasized have a poorer prognosis than small tumors that are confined to the breast. The expression of specific proteins within the tumor also provides prognostic information. One protein whose expression is associated with a poor prognosis is vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). VEGF stimulates angiogenesis&#x02014;the growth of new blood vessels. Small tumors get the nutrients needed for their growth from existing blood vessels but large tumors need to organize their own blood supply. They do this, in part, by secreting VEGF. This compound binds to proteins (receptors) on the surface of endothelial cells (the cells lining blood vessels), which then send a signal into the cell instructing it to make new blood vessels. Angiogenesis inhibitors, including molecules that block the activity of VEGF receptors, are being developed for the treatment of cancer.</p></sec><sec id="sb1b"><title>Why Was This Study Done?</title><p>Some breast cancer cell lines (cells isolated from breast cancers and grown in the laboratory) make VEGF and VEGF receptors (VEGFR1, VEGFR2, and neuropilin 1 &#x0005b;NRP1&#x0005d;). But, although some studies have reported an association between VEGFR1 expression in breast tumors and a poor prognosis, other studies have found no expression of VEGFR1 in breast tumors. Consequently, the role of VEGF receptors in breast cancer is unclear. In this study, the researchers analyzed the expression and function of VEGF and its receptors in breast cancer cells to investigate whether and how VEGF helps these cells to survive.</p></sec><sec id="sb1c"><title>What Did the Researchers Do and Find?</title><p>The researchers first examined the expression of VEGF receptors in several human breast cancer cell lines. All of them expressed VEGFR1, some expressed NRP1, but VEGFR2 expression was universally low. They then investigated the function of VEGF and its receptors in two human breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7). In both cell lines, blocking the expression of VEGF or of VEGFR1 (but not of the other two receptors) reduced cell survival by stimulating a specific process of cell death called apoptosis. Unexpectedly, adding VEGF to the cultures did not reverse the effect of blocking VEGF expression, a result that suggests that VEGF and VEGFR1 do not affect breast cancer cell survival by acting at the cell surface. Accordingly, when the researchers examined where VEGFR1 occurs in the cell, they found it on the membranes around the nucleus of the breast cancer cell lines and not on the cell surface; several primary breast tumors and normal breast tissue had the same localization pattern. Finally, the researchers showed that inhibitors of VEGF action that act at the cell surface did not affect the survival of the breast cancer cell lines.</p></sec><sec id="sb1d"><title>What Do These Findings Mean?</title><p>These findings suggest that VEGF helps breast cancer cells to survive in a unique way: by binding to VEGFR1 inside the cell. In other words, whereas VEGF normally acts as a paracrine growth factor (it is released by one cell and affects another cell), in breast cancer cells it might act as an internal autocrine (intracrine) survival factor, a factor that affects the cells in which it is produced. These findings need confirming in more cell lines and in primary breast cancers but could have important implications for the treatment of breast cancer. Inhibitors of VEGF and VEGFR1 that act inside the cell (small molecule drugs) might block breast cancer growth more effectively than inhibitors that act at the cell surface (for example, proteins that bind to the receptor), because internally acting inhibitors might both kill the tumor directly and have antiangiogenic effects, whereas externally acting inhibitors could only have the second effect.</p></sec><sec id="sb1e"><title>Additional Information.</title><p>Please access these Web sites via the online version of this summary at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0040186">http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0040186</ext-link>.</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>US National Cancer Institute information for patients and professionals on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/types/breast">breast cancer</ext-link> (in English and Spanish) and on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/understandingcancer/angiogenesis">angiogenesis</ext-link> (in English and Spanish)</p></list-item><list-item><p>MedlinePlus Encyclopedia information for patients on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000913.htm">breast cancer</ext-link> (in English and Spanish)</p></list-item><list-item><p>CancerQuest, information from Emory University on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cancerquest.org/index.cfm?page=380">cancer biology</ext-link> and on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cancerquest.org/index.cfm?page=189">angiogenesis and angiogenesis inhibitors </ext-link> (in several languages)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Wikipedia pages on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vascular_endothelial_growth_factor">VEGF</ext-link> (note: Wikipedia is a free online encyclopedia that anyone can edit; available in several languages)</p></list-item></list></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="16"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Lee TH, Seng S, Sekine M, Hinton C, Fu Y, et al.

Lamins are known to be the main components of intermediate filaments in the nuclear membrane. Tissue sections of human normal breast and invasive ductal breast carcinoma of varying pathological stages were immunostained for VEGFR1.

HBMECs were used as positive cells for VEGF receptor expression. The breast cancer cell lines include MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-453, and BT-474, which are highly aggressive and form tumors and metastasis in vivo when inoculated into nude mice. The MCF-7 and T-47D breast cancer cell lines form tumors when inoculated into nude mice, but are less tumorigenic as they do not metastasize in vivo in the mice. We used 5 mg of total breast cancer cell lysates to examine the expression levels of VEGFR1, VEGFR2, and NRP1. VEGFR1 expression was abundant in all breast cancer cell lines, NRP1 expression was variable and observed primarily in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells, while the levels of VEGFR2 expression were low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0040186-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). We next examined the expression of VEGFR2 in MDA-MB-231 cells by immunocytochemistry staining using anti-VEGFR2 antibody. For the positive control, MDA-MB-231 cells were transduced with adenovirus encoding soluble human VEGFR2. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0040186-g001">Figure 1</xref>B, unlike the MDA-MB-231 cells transduced with VEGFR2, no endogenous VEGFR2 expression was detected in untransfected MDA-MB-231 cells by immunocytochemistry analysis and confocal microscopy. These data suggest that VEGFR2 was expressed at relatively low levels compared to VEGFR1 and NRP1 in breast cancer cells. These results are consistent with our previous report detailing VEGFR2 mRNA expression in breast cancer cell lines &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040186-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>As noted above, we found that both MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 breast cancer cells expressed high levels of NRP1, while its expression was low in T-47D, BT-474, SK-BR-3, and MDA-MB-453 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0040186-g001">Figure 1</xref>A).

The effects of <italic>VEGF</italic> antisense on apoptosis were also examined by cell cycle analysis and TUNEL assays. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0040186-g001">Figure 1</xref>D, cell cycle analysis revealed a higher percentage of apoptotic cells in the AS-C1 (11.28&#x00025; &#x000b1; 2.7&#x00025;) and AS-C2 (14.47&#x00025; &#x000b1; 2.8&#x00025;) clones, as compared to the parental (0.74&#x00025; &#x000b1; 0.05&#x00025;) and pZeoSV control cells (0.51&#x00025; &#x000b1; 0.12&#x00025;) (the results represent the mean &#x000b1; standard deviation &#x0005b;SD&#x0005d; of three independent experiments). Similar apoptotic effects were observed in AS-C1 and AS-C2 cells using the TUNEL assay.

To further confirm these results, MDA-MB-231 cells were transiently transfected with siRNA oligonucleotides for <italic>VEGF</italic> or with siCTL for 5 d. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0040186-g001">Figure 1</xref>F, siVEGF induced a knock-down in VEGF production and reduced the survival of the MDA-MB-231 cells as compared to the siCTL. Cells transfected with siCTL showed a low rate of apoptosis (5.07&#x00025; &#x000b1; 1.79&#x00025;), whereas a 3-fold increase in apoptosis was observed in cells transfected with siVEGF (15.89&#x00025; &#x000b1; 1.91&#x00025;).

To eliminate the nonspecific effect of functional siVEGFR1 on MDA-MB-231 cell survival, we used mutated siVEGFR1 oligonucleotides.

Since PGF failed to rescue the survival of siVEGF-treated cells, this prompted us to study the localization of VEGFR1 expression in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 breast cancer cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0040186-g006">Figure 6</xref>, no VEGFR1 expression was detected at the surface of the MDA-MB-231 cells, while expression of VEGFR1 in the MCF-7 cells was low. The VEGFR1 antibodies used in these studies were specific for the detection of the full-length membrane form of VEGFR1. However, when these cells were permeabilized, we observed positive expression of VEGFR1 in both cell lines, indicating that VEGFR1 is expressed internally in both MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells. We next examined the expression of VEGFR1 in the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions of MDA-MB-231 cells as compared to HUVECs. Cellular fractions were subjected to Western blot analysis for VEGFR1, lamin B1 (a nuclear marker), GAPDH (a cytoplasmic marker), and actin. The levels of VEGFR1 expression in the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions were quantitated by Scion image software.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0040186-g007">Figure 7</xref>, VEGFR1 was mainly observed in the nuclear envelope of these cells. In addition, VEGFR1 was colocalized with LMNA at the nuclear envelope of both the MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. Merging of the VEGFR1 and LMNA immunostaining confirmed the colocalization of VEGFR1 with LMNA at the nuclear envelope in these cells. We further confirmed these results with additional antibodies against VEGFR1 that specifically recognize the membrane form of VEGFR1 and do not cross-react with soluble VEGFR1 (unpublished data). To demonstrate the specificity of the staining, we treated MDA-MB-231 cells with siCTL or with wild-type or mutant siVEGFR1, and analyzed the cells for the expression and sublocalization of VEGFR1. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0040186-g008">Figure 8</xref>, the siVEGFR1 treatments resulted in a substantial decrease in VEGFR1 expression in these cells. Specifically, no expression of VEGFR1 was observed in the nuclear envelope nor was any colocalization of VEGFR1 with LMNA found in these cells, as compared to the control siRNA-treated cells.</p><p>We next examined the expression of VEGFR1 in ten sporadic breast cancer tumors. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0040186-g009">Figure 9</xref>, strong expression of VEGFR1 was found in the nuclear envelope and the cytoplasm of these tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0040186-g009">Figure 9</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0040186-g009">9</xref>B), whereas VEGFR1 expression was mainly observed at the nuclear envelope in normal mammary gland tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0040186-g009">Figure 9</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0040186-g009">9</xref>D). No membrane staining of VEGFR1 was observed in breast tumor or normal mammary gland tissues. Therefore, although VEGFR1 is expressed as a plasma membrane protein in endothelial cells, it is mainly expressed in the nuclear envelope in breast cancer cell lines, primary breast tumors, and normal mammary glands.</p></sec><sec id="s3j"><title>VEGF and Its Protein Inhibitors Have No Biological Effects on Breast Cancer Cells</title><p>Based on the VEGFR1 localization results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0040186-g006">Figure 6</xref>), we tested whether functional blocking of VEGFR1 would inhibit the growth or survival of breast cancer cells. For these experiments, we used VEGFR1-specific blocking antibody, which is known to inhibit the VEGF-induced migration of monocytes expressing VEGFR1 only &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040186-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;. MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells were seeded onto six-well plates at a density of 5,000 cells per well. Following 4 d of treatment with the specific blocking antibody, cell proliferation was analyzed. The proliferation rates were similar in the MDA-MB-231 cells treated with 0, 2, and 10 &#x003bc;g/ml of VEGFR1 blocking antibody 100&#x00025; (100&#x00025; &#x000b1; 9.16&#x00025;), 88&#x00025; (87.66&#x00025; &#x000b1; 8.08&#x00025;), and 91&#x00025; (91.11&#x00025; &#x000b1; 7.56&#x00025;), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0040186-g010">Figure 10</xref>). Similar observations were made in MCF-7 cells treated with 0, 2, and 10 &#x003bc;g/ml of the VEGFR1 blocking antibody: the proliferation rates were 100&#x00025; (100.12&#x00025; &#x000b1; 9.53&#x00025;), 87&#x00025; (86.66&#x00025; &#x000b1; 17.67&#x00025;) and 100&#x00025; (100.33&#x00025; &#x000b1; 12.70&#x00025;) in the cells, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0040186-g010">Figure 10</xref>). Thus, this antibody did not inhibit the proliferation of the MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 cells. Using cell cycle analysis, we confirmed that this antibody had no effect on the survival of these cancer cells, since VEGFR1 is mostly expressed internally and not on the surface of breast cancer cells as expected (unpublished data). These results are consistent with our previous report showing that VEGF had no effect on the invasion of MDA-MB-231 cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040186-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;. In addition, VEGF blocking antibody or soluble VEGFR1 protein had no effect on the survival or proliferation of MDA-MB-231 cells (unpublished data). Taken together, these data indicate that VEGF plays a role as an intracrine survival factor in breast carcinoma cells through VEGFR1, which is mainly expressed internally.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we found that several breast cancer cell lines expressed VEGF receptors. Furthermore, we showed that reduced endogenous VEGF or VEGFR1 expression induced the apoptosis of MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 breast cancer cells, whereas externally acting proteins (VEGF, VEGF antibody, soluble VEGFR1, and VEGFR1-blocking antibody) had no significant effects on breast cancer cell growth or survival. We also observed that internally expressed VEGFR1 induced the survival of breast cancer cells. These results indicate that VEGF plays a role as an internal autocrine survival factor in breast cancer cells via VEGFR1 and not through VEGFR2 or NRP1, and suggest that the role of the VEGF/VEGFR1 axis in breast cancer cells may not be governed by the classical paradigm of signal transduction involving interaction between ligands and cell surface receptors.</p><p>VEGF contributes to the growth of solid tumors, such as breast cancer, through angiogenesis rather than through a direct contribution to tumor cell survival. This effect seems to be derived partly from the poor response of tumor cells to externally acting molecules such as VEGF or antibodies to VEGF. However, this concept has now been challenged by recent reports showing that some cancer cells express VEGF receptors on their surfaces in vitro and in vivo, and that in several tumor cell types, including leukemia and melanoma cells, VEGF acts as an autocrine survival factor &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040186-b022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040186-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d;.

Dales et al &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040186-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d; reported that VEGFR1 and VEGFR2 were strongly expressed in endothelial cells within blood microvessels, and weakly expressed in tumor cells in a series of 918 patients. Univariate analysis showed that the expression of VEGFR1 in tumor cells was not correlated with survival, but was significantly correlated with high metastasis risk &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040186-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;. In another study involving 905 cases of breast cancer tumors &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040186-b029">29</xref>&#x0005d;, the expression of VEGFR1 was correlated with a high risk of local recurrence. On the other hand, VEGFR1 expression was rarely observed in 205 cases of ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040186-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;. Thus, there are conflicting reports regarding the expression and role of VEGFR1 in breast cancer. No correlation between survival and metastasis risk and relapse was found in breast cancer cells that expressed VEGFR2 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040186-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;. Therefore, the role of VEGF as an angiogenic factor and/or as a survival factor in tumor cells needs to be fully investigated.</p><p>Our siRNA studies on VEGF receptors revealed that VEGF can modulate the survival of breast cancer cells via VEGFR1, but not VEGFR2. Here, we show that VEGFR1 mediated AKT phosphorylation, a major survival pathway in breast cancer cells. It is known that VEGF mediates most angiogenic processes by interacting with VEGFR2 in endothelial cells. VEGF can also modulate VEGFR2 expression as well as its phosphorylation in endothelial cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040186-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d;. Thus, down-regulation of VEGF expression may induce apoptosis in the MDA-MB-231 clones AS-C1 and AS-C2 through the decreased VEGFR2 expression in these cells. However, our studies with siVEGFR2 demonstrated that VEGFR2 is not important for the survival of breast cancer cells. Although VEGFR2 has strong tyrosine kinase activity compared to VEGFR1 in endothelial cells, the level of VEGFR2 expression in MDA-MB-231 and MCF-7 breast cancer cells might not be sufficient to induce VEGF-mediated signaling in these cells. In fact, we almost could not detect VEGFR2 protein expression by immunoprecipitation, nor could we detect any expression of this protein by immunocytochemical analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0040186-g001">Figure 1</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0040186-g001">1</xref>B).</p><p>VEGFR2 tyrosine phosphorylation was reported to be enhanced by VEGF in breast cancer and to lead to increased ERK1/2 (extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2) and AKT phosphorylation, suggesting that VEGF stimulation is important in the regulation of cell growth, apoptosis, and differentiation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040186-b031">31</xref>&#x0005d;. VEGFR2 was also shown to be expressed on the surface of breast cancer cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040186-b031">31</xref>&#x0005d;. However, these results differ from our data since the level of expression of VEGFR2 was very low in our cell system, and knockdown of VEGFR2 by siRNA treatment had no effect on the apoptosis of breast cancer cells. Additionally, we examined the effect of NRP1 on the survival of MDA-MB-231 cells, as it was previously reported that VEGF mediates the autocrine survival of these cells through NRP1 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040186-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d;; we failed to show that NRP1 mediated VEGF-induced survival in MDA-MB-231 cells. NRP1 is known to interact with VEGFR1 but has a very short cytoplasmic domain &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040186-b032">32</xref>&#x0005d;, suggesting that NRP1 may not directly transduce VEGF-mediated signaling in these cells. Although we can not fully explain these discrepancies, based on our results it is unlikely that VEGFR2 or NRP1 has a direct functional effect on VEGF-mediated survival in MDA-MB-231 cells. Knockdown of endogenous VEGF expression or addition of VEGFR synthetic inhibitors resulted in the apoptosis of hematopoietic stem cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040186-b033">33</xref>&#x0005d;, whereas VEGF or soluble VEGFR1 did not have any effect on the survival of these cells. Therefore, the survival mechanism of VEGF in breast cancer cells might be different from that of VEGF in endothelial cells, and may mimic the VEGF-dependent survival system in hematopoietic stem cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040186-b033">33</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>VEGFR1 was originally thought to be a receptor specifically expressed in vascular endothelial cells. However, some studies have shown that VEGFR1 is expressed in tumor cells and is involved in tumor growth and progression &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040186-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040186-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040186-b020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040186-b034">34</xref>&#x0005d;. VEGF has also been shown to increase the invasiveness of colorectal cancer cells or myeloma cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040186-b015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040186-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;, and VEGFR1-blocking antibody was reported to inhibit the VEGF-induced invasiveness of these cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040186-b015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040186-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;. These results indicate that VEGF can act as an autocrine or paracrine factor in the invasiveness of both cell types via VEGFR1. These previously published studies are different from our present data, which show that neither exogenous VEGF nor VEGFR1-blocking antibody has any significant effects on the invasiveness or survival of breast cancer cells. We observed that VEGFR1 was expressed internally, but not on the surface of breast cancer cells. The localization of VEGFR1 expression in breast cancer cells is a novel finding that may support our observations that VEGF plays a role as an internal autocrine survival factor in these cells. It remains to be elucidated how VEGFR1 is expressed internally in breast cancer cells, and how it mediates VEGF-induced survival in these cells.</p><p>The results of our studies differ from those of studies by Vincent et al. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040186-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d; showing that VEGF facilitated the growth and survival of human primary multiple myeloma cells via VEGFR1. In that study, VEGFR1 was shown to be present in the cytoplasm and the nuclei of proliferating multiple myeloma cells. Vincent et al. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040186-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d; reported that a monoclonal antibody against VEGFR1 inhibited the proliferation and migration of primary multiple myeloma cells via plasma membrane retention of VEGFR1 following the prevention of its nuclear translocation. In our study, however, externally acting growth factors, such as VEGF and VEGFR1-blocking antibody, had no effects on breast cancer cell growth or survival. Furthermore, VEGFR1 receptors were mostly expressed internally, and not on the surface of breast cancer cells, which may provide a mechanism for the lack of inhibition of breast cancer cell growth by antibody to VEGFR1. We also observed localization of VEGFR1 mainly in the nuclear envelope in breast cancer cell lines, primary breast cancer tumors, and normal mammary glands. These results suggest that the expression pattern, localization, and function of VEGFR1 may differ between breast epithelial cells and endothelial cells.</p><p>Although VEGF has a signal peptide that induces its direct secretion through the classical secretory pathway, VEGF can also translocate to the nucleus &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040186-b035">35</xref>&#x0005d;. Moreover, VEGF contains basic amino acids that could act as potential nuclear localization signals &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040186-b036">36</xref>&#x0005d;. Recent studies showed that VEGF protein colocalizes with the RNA-binding protein HuR in discrete nuclear compartments and that nuclear VEGF protein is increased in hypoxia &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040186-b036">36</xref>&#x0005d;. These results indicate that VEGF may have a nuclear function, especially during hypoxia. Furthermore, VEGF nuclear accumulation is correlated with phenotypic changes in endothelial cells &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040186-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d;. VEGF is internalized via the classical receptor-mediated endocytosis pathway and accumulates in the endosomal compartment, whereas in cells situated at the edges of a wound, VEGF is rapidly taken up and translocated to the nucleus &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040186-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d;. Therefore, it is possible that VEGF may be retained within the cell for its interaction with perinuclear VEGFR1. Future studies will address the function of VEGFR1 in live breast cancer cells and normal breast epithelial cells, and determine the kinetics, translocation, and binding of VEGFR1 to VEGF in these cells.</p><p>The limitation of our study is that the intracrine role of VEGF/VEGFR1 was examined in two breast cancer cell lines and in only a few samples of primary breast tumors. These results may not be fully applicable to all breast cancer samples, representing different stages of the disease. Thus, further studies of breast cancer cells from patients at different clinical stages of the disease will be necessary to define the pathophysiologic role of the VEGF/VEGFR1 axis in intracrine signaling. In addition, although we were able to examine the functional blocking of VEGFR1 using antibodies that were readily accessible to our laboratory, other VEGFR1 antibodies (that are currently unavailable to us) need to be examined for their effects on breast cancer cell growth and proliferation in vivo in this system, once these antibodies become available.</p><p>Recently it was reported that VEGFR1 expression was significantly increased in breast cancer patients with a poor prognosis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040186-b037">37</xref>&#x0005d;. Consistent with that report, our data suggest that VEGFR1 might be an attractive target for therapeutic approaches in patients with malignant breast cancer. Furthermore, our data suggest that intracellularly acting inhibitors against VEGF and its receptor VEGFR1 might be a more effective therapeutic method for breast cancer patients as compared to the externally acting inhibitors. Specifically, the former approach will exert direct tumor-killing effects as well as antiangiogenic effects, while the latter approach will exert indirect tumor-killing effects through antiangiogenic activity alone. Hence, our study may provide an optimal strategy for tumor therapy based on the inhibition of angiogenesis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Accession Numbers</title><p>The GenBank (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/</ext-link>) accession numbers of the genes/proteins discussed in this paper are <italic>lamin A/C</italic> (<italic>LMNA;</italic> NM&#x0005f;170707), <italic>lamin B1</italic> (<italic>LMNB1;</italic> NM&#x0005f;005573), <italic>neuropilin 1</italic> (<italic>NRP1;</italic> AF016050), <italic>placental growth factor</italic> (<italic>PGF;</italic> S72960), <italic>vascular endothelial growth factor</italic> (<italic>VEGF;</italic> AB021221), <italic>vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1</italic> (<italic>VEGFR1/FLT1;</italic> AF063657), and <italic>vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2</italic> (<italic>VEGFR2/KDR/FLK1;</italic> AF035121).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Wei Fu and Heather Kil for their typing assistance.
