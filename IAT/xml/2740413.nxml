ALDH2 denitrates GTN to 1,2-glyceryl dinitrate and nitrite but also catalyzes reduction of GTN to NO. To elucidate the relationship between ALDH2-catalyzed GTN bioconversion and established ALDH2 activities (dehydrogenase, esterase), we compared the function of the wild type (WT) enzyme with mutants lacking either the reactive Cys-302 (C302S) or the general base Glu-268 (E268Q). Although the C302S mutation led to &#x0003e;90% loss of all enzyme activities, the E268Q mutant exhibited virtually unaffected rates of GTN denitration despite low dehydrogenase and esterase activities. The nucleotide co-factor NAD caused a pronounced increase in the rates of 1,2-glyceryl dinitrate formation by WT-ALDH2 but inhibited the reaction catalyzed by the E268Q mutant. GTN bioactivation measured as activation of purified soluble guanylate cyclase or release of NO in the presence of WT- or E268Q-ALDH2 was markedly potentiated by superoxide dismutase, suggesting that bioavailability of GTN-derived NO is limited by co-generation of superoxide. Formation of superoxide was confirmed by determination of hydroethidine oxidation that was inhibited by superoxide dismutase and the ALDH2 inhibitor chloral hydrate. E268Q-ALDH2 exhibited &#x0223c;50% lower rates of superoxide formation than the WT enzyme. Our results suggest that Glu-268 is involved in the structural organization of the NAD-binding pocket but is not required for GTN denitration. ALDH2-catalyzed superoxide formation may essentially contribute to oxidative stress in GTN-exposed blood vessels.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDH; EC 1.2.1.3)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="FN2"><sup>2</sup></xref> catalyze the oxidation of aliphatic and aromatic aldehyde substrates to the corresponding carboxylic acids with NAD(P) serving as electron accepting co-factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). The mitochondrial isoform (ALDH2), a homotetrameric protein with subunits of &#x0223c;54 kDa, appears to be essential for detoxification of ethanol-derived acetaldehyde, as indicated by significantly lowered alcohol tolerance of individuals expressing a low activity mutant of the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Aldehyde oxidation by ALDH2 is thought to involve nucleophilic reaction of the substrate with a critical cysteine residue in the active site (Cys-302 in the human protein), resulting in formation of a thiohemiacetal intermediate, followed by hydride transfer to NAD, yielding a thioester intermediate that is hydrolyzed to the carboxylic acid product in a reaction that involves activation of H<sub>2</sub>O by an adjacent glutamate residue (Glu-268). In addition to aldehyde oxidation, ALDH2 catalyzes ester hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). The esterase activity is stimulated by NAD, but the co-factor is not essential for the reaction, which is initiated by nucleophilic attack of the substrate by Cys-302, resulting in formation of a thioester and release of the corresponding alcohol by hydrolysis of the intermediate through activation of water by Glu-268 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>).</p><p>The beneficial therapeutic effects of the antianginal drug GTN are thought to involve bioactivation of the organic nitrate in vascular smooth muscle to yield NO or a related species that activates sGC, resulting in cGMP-mediated vasorelaxation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). In a seminal paper published in 2002, Stamler and co-workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>) discovered that ALDH2 essentially contributes to vascular GTN bioactivation, and this has been confirmed in numerous later studies (for review see Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Stamler and co-workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>) proposed that GTN denitration involves the established esterase activity of ALDH2, <italic>i.e.</italic> nucleophilic attack of a nitro group of GTN by Cys-302, resulting in formation of a thionitrate intermediate and release of the corresponding alcohol, preferentially 1,2-glyceryl dinitrate (1,2-GDN). The thionitrate intermediate would then release nitrite either through nucleophilic attack of one of the adjacent cysteine residues (Cys-301 or Cys-303), resulting in formation of a disulfide in the active site, or through Glu-268-aided hydrolysis yielding a sulfenic acid derivative of Cys-302, which could undergo <italic>S</italic>-thiolation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>) to form a cysteinyl disulfide with one of the adjacent cysteine residues. This mechanism would be compatible both with the effect of NAD, which is not essential but increases reaction rates, and with GTN-triggered enzyme inactivation that is partially prevented by reduced thiols with two SH groups like DTT or dihydrolipoic acid. According to a brief statement in a paper on the structure of the East Asian (E487K) variant, mutation of Cys-302 and Glu-268 resulted in an almost complete loss of GTN reductase activity of ALDH2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>), but so far the proposed role of these residues in GTN metabolism has not been thoroughly studied, and the mechanism underlying bioactivation of the nitrate is still unknown.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><sec><title/><sec><title/><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title><p>Bovine lung sGC was purified as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>).

In contrast to the WT enzyme, E268Q-ALDH2 did not catalyze significant 1,2-GDN formation in the presence of NAD at any GTN concentration. In the absence of the nicotinamide, the mutant exhibited identical rates of GTN denitration as the WT enzyme over the whole GTN concentration range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref><italic>A</italic>). A similar pattern was obtained when the initial rates of GTN denitration were measured as a function of the protein concentration after 1 min of incubation.

The activity of the WT enzyme was markedly increased by NAD, whereas the activity of the mutant was decreased at all of the protein concentrations tested.

In their original report Stamler and co-workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>) proposed a reaction of GTN with the nucleophilic Cys-302 residue of ALDH2 as the initial step of GTN bioconversion. Our results with C302S-ALDH2 support this proposal, even though residual GTN reductase activity of the mutant (&#x0223c;10% of WT) suggests minor contributions of other nucleophilic residues, <italic>e.g.</italic> Cys-301 or Cys-303, to the overall reaction. The loss of aldehyde dehydrogenase and esterase activities upon mutation of Glu-268 agrees well with a previous report showing that this residue is essentially involved in hydride transfer, activation of Cys-302, hydrolysis of thioester intermediates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>), and, of note, GTN denitration measured in the presence of NAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Although the presence of NAD as hydride acceptor is obligatory for the dehydrogenase reaction, significant ester hydrolysis occurs also in the absence of NAD, indicating that the nucleotide is not an essential co-factor but accelerates reaction rates through a conformational change of the active site (see below). Surprisingly, NAD did not stimulate but inhibited the residual esterase activity of E268Q-ALDH2 by &#x0223c;90%. The divergent effects of NAD were also apparent in GTN denitration assays showing identical reaction rates of WT- and E268Q-ALDH2 in the absence of NAD, whereas the nicotinamide increased the activity of WT but decreased GTN denitration by the E268Q mutant. The effect of NAD on WT-ALDH2 was mainly because of an increase in apparent GTN affinity, resulting in diminished stimulation by the nucleotide with increasing GTN concentrations as observed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). With the mutant, the inhibitory effect of NAD was not overcome by high GTN, but at increasing protein concentrations the E268Q variant exhibited significant activity even in the presence of NAD.</p><sec><title/><sec><title/><sec><title>Structural Basis for the Divergent Effects of NAD</title><p>In the apo form of WT-ALDH2 two different side chain conformations of E268 have been observed (Protein Data Bank code <ext-link ext-link-type="pdb" xlink:href="1o05">1o05</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>); in the first the carboxylate points toward Cys-302, whereas it is more remote (&#x0223c;6.5 &#x0212b;) in the second conformation. The latter state is supposed to be catalytically competent by accommodating and activating a water molecule positioned between the carboxylate and the thioester intermediate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Among the eight crystallographically independent active sites in the apo structure, five have the Glu-268 side chain in the &#x0201c;active&#x0201d; and three in the &#x0201c;inactive&#x0201d; conformation. The situation changes completely when NAD is bound (with the nicotinamide mononucleotide moiety in the hydrolysis conformation), because all Glu-268 side chains are in the active conformation (Protein Data Bank codes <ext-link ext-link-type="pdb" xlink:href="1o00">1o00</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="pdb" xlink:href="1o01">1o01</ext-link>, and <ext-link ext-link-type="pdb" xlink:href="1o02">1o02</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). This shift in the equilibrium in favor of the active conformation could explain the observed increase in esterase activity. Additional effects on the activity caused by interactions of the esterase substrate or the tetrahedral intermediate with the bound co-factor cannot be excluded. Similarly, alternate conformations have also been observed for the nicotinamide moiety in structures of ALDH2 with bound co-factor. In one conformation, termed &#x0201c;hydride transfer conformation,&#x0201d; the pyridine ring is close to Cys-302, whereas in the other, the &#x0201c;hydrolysis conformation,&#x0201d; it has moved away toward the entrance to the active site. It has been hypothesized that NAD can be bound in both states somewhat favoring the &#x0201c;hydride transfer&#x0201d; conformation. In the latter state, the nicotinamide ring is positioned between Glu-268 and Cys-302, which is very well compatible with hydride transfer (hence the name) but incompatible with hydrolysis of an acyl enzyme intermediate at Cys-302. The opposite applies to the other NAD conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>).</p><p>A possible explanation for the decrease of the esterolytic activity of the E268Q variant of ALDH2 upon NAD binding is, again, a shift in the equilibrium between the two co-factor conformations. If the hydride transfer conformation is relatively favored by the enzyme variant over the hydrolysis conformation, this would lead to the observed activity loss. In WT-ALDH2, Glu-268 forms a single hydrogen bond to the nicotinamide in the hydride transfer conformation. Thus, a shift toward this co-factor conformation (which inhibits ester hydrolysis) could be accomplished by additional interactions possible for a glutamine compared with a glutamate side chain (<italic>e.g.</italic> two hydrogen bonds formed with the carboxamide of the co-factor).</p></sec><sec><title>Formation of GTN-derived NO</title><p>Formation of 1,2-GDN correlated reasonably well with GTN bioactivation assayed as NO release or sGC activation in the presence of SOD, suggesting that 1,2-GDN and NO are derived from a common reaction intermediate, presumably a thionitrate involving Cys-302 or, to minor extent, one of the adjacent cysteine residues. The mechanism of NO formation is unknown, but our data indicate that the thionitrate intermediate is converted through two distinct pathways that both yield 1,2-GDN but either nitrite or NO as co-products. The three-electron reduction pathway yielding NO appears to account for 5&#x02013;10% of total GTN turnover catalyzed by WT-ALDH2. However, in the reaction catalyzed by E268Q-ALDH2 in the presence of NAD, fractional NO formation increased to up to 50% of total turnover, suggesting that the two pathways are not necessarily linked. Although this pronounced increase in relative NO formation occurred under conditions of very low rates of GTN denitration, there was no obvious correlation between the rates of GTN turnover and the fraction of GTN converted to NO. At present we can only conclude that the partitioning between the two- and three-electron reduction pathways of GTN denitration appears to be determined by the active site structure involving Glu-268 of human ALDH2.</p><p>The present study showing significant cGMP accumulation in the presence of submicromolar concentrations of GTN strongly suggests that ALDH2-catalyzed three-electron reduction of GTN to yield NO mediates vascular GTN bioactivity <italic>in vivo</italic>. However, this may not be the complete story, because several laboratories failed to detect GTN-derived NO in blood vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). There are several possibilities to explain this discrepancy. First, despite the impressive activation of sGC that we observed in the course of the ALDH2/GTN reaction, we cannot rule out the possibility that ALDH2-catalyzed NO formation is a peculiarity of the purified enzyme unrelated to vascular GTN bioactivation. Second, GTN-derived NO could be converted efficiently to a stable transport form that delivers NO to cytosolic sGC without significant release of free NO. Finally, taking into account that a considerable amount of vascular ALDH2 is found in soluble fractions of blood vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>), GTN bioactivation may occur in the cytosol rather than in mitochondria and involve local interaction of ALDH2 with sGC. Further work is needed to clarify this issue.</p></sec><sec><title>Mechanism-based Superoxide Formation</title><p>Our data provide strong evidence for co-generation of superoxide that limits the bioavailability of GTN-derived NO. First, SOD markedly potentiated sGC activation by GTN without having any effect on the rates of GTN denitration or turnover-dependent enzyme inactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Fig. 7</xref>). Second, ALDH2-catalyzed GTN turnover compromised NO stimulation of sGC, and this was prevented by the superoxide scavengers SOD and hydralazine. Finally, ALDH2-catalyzed GTN metabolism resulted in significant oxidation of hydroethidine that was inhibited by SOD and chloral hydrate. The source of the apparent superoxide generation is unknown. The two- and three-electron reduction pathways of GTN metabolism probably involve cysteine oxidation and could give rise to formation of reactive cysteine oxides, <italic>e.g.</italic> disulfide anion radical intermediates, that reduce O<sub>2</sub> to superoxide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>). Accordingly, lower reactivity of a critical cysteine residue in ALDH2 lacking the general base Glu-268 could explain reduced superoxide formation by the E268Q mutant and thus the observed increase in NO bioavailability as compared with the WT enzyme that was apparent as significant formation of detectable NO in the absence of SOD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>).</p><p>Despite ample evidence that exposure of blood vessels to GTN causes superoxide formation that limits NO bioavailability in nitrate tolerance and beneficial effects of antioxidants documented by both animal and clinical studies, the actual source of superoxide in the vasculature is still a matter of debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). The proposed pathways of GTN-induced vascular superoxide formation include activation of NADPH oxidase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>), endothelial NO synthase uncoupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>), and dysregulation of the mitochondrial respiratory chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33"/>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). Considering the present findings in conjunction with the essential role of ALDH2 in vascular GTN bioactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>), it is tempting to speculate that superoxide-mediated nitrate tolerance is a direct consequence of the ALDH2/GTN reaction and that superoxide scavengers like ascorbate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>) or Mn-SOD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>) exert their beneficial effects at least partially through scavenging of ALDH2/GTN-derived superoxide.
