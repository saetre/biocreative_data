The RT enzyme naturally exists as a p66/p51 heterodimer that can undergo post-translational modification in terms of its presence in both virions and cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Subtype C variants of HIV-1 are responsible for ~50% of the worldwide pandemic, representing the dominant epidemics in Sub-Saharan Africa and India [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In spite of this, no work has yet been reported on the differential biochemistry of subtype C reverse transcriptase (RT). Most data are inferred from enzymatic studies on prototypic subtype B viruses circulating in the Western world that represent &#x0003c; 12% of the global pandemic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>Genetic divergence in the RT enzyme may also be linked to differential acquisition of resistance to nucleoside or nucleotide RT inhibitors (N(t)RTIs) that are core constituents of antiretroviral (ARV) regimens for treatment of HIV-1 infection. These drugs include the eight N(t)RTIs approved for clinical treatment of HIV-1 infection: zidovudine (ZDV), stavudine (d4T), didanosine (ddI), lamivudine (3TC), zalcitabine (ddC), abacavir (ABC), emtricitabine (FTC) and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>The RT mutation K65R can be selected by each of tenofovir (TFV), ddI, ddC, ABC and d4T and yields decreased susceptibility to all clinically used NRTIs except ZDV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Our laboratory has described the facilitated selection of K65R in subtype C in cell culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Recent clinical studies show the preferential emergence of K65R in subtype C-infected patients failing d4T/ddI based regimens in Botswana (30%), and d4T/3TC-based regimens in South Africa and Malawi (7&#x02013;20%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. In contrast, K65R is present in only 1.8% of subtype B HIV-1 infected patients failing d4T based regimens in the Stanford HIV Resistance Database (accessed Dec 11, 2008) and is only common in patients failing TFV-containing regimens (up to15%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>Although subtype C viruses harbour a unique KKK nucleotide motif, amino acid polymorphisms and codon bias at position 65 cannot explain the differential acquisition of K65R in subtype C variants. In subtype B the mutation required in codon 65 is AAA &#x02192; A<underline>G</underline>A while it is AAG &#x02192; A<underline>G</underline>G in subtype C. The present study was designed to determine if variations in enzymatic function might be responsible for the higher propensity of K65R to occur in subtype C. In this work, we have characterized the enzymatic properties of recombinant B and wild-type RTs as well as RTs harboring the K65R and K65R/M184V mutations.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Purification of recombinant HIV-1 RT and specific activity analysis</title><p>Recombinant heterodimer (p66/p51) RTs from both subtype C and B were purified to &#x0003e; 95% homogeneity; all RT subunits p66 and p51 were processed to similar molar ratio (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). To determine the specific activity of the recombinant enzyme preparations, DNA polymerase activity was measured using synthetic poly(rA)/(dT)12&#x02013;18 template/primer over a 15-min initial rate reaction. The calculated initial velocities were then divided by the concentration of enzyme used in the assay to determine the specific activity of the recombinant RT preparations (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Wild-type RTs from both subtypes shared similar activities. All mutant enzymes were significantly impaired in specific activity compared with wild-type enzyme, with K65R exhibiting only 46%&#x02013;50% of wild-type activity and K65R+M184V RT exhibiting only &#x02248; 30% of wild-type activity.

In cell culture assays, subtype C K65R viruses, like subtype B K65R viruses, exhibited lower replication capacity and addition of M184V enhanced this effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In our cell-free assay with subtype C RTs harbouring K65R and K65R/M184V, we also observed impaired efficiency of (-)ssDNA synthesis; the decrease in product formation was most pronounced at earlier time points (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>).

The same TFV resistance mechanisms exist in both subtypes B and C, and both impaired discrimination and excision determine TFV susceptibility.</p><p>The K65R mutation is located in the fingers domain of RT and its effect on reduction of NRTI incorporation and reduced excision is probably due to an increased rigidity of the active site and effective trapping of the dinucleoside tetraphosphate excision product [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Natural polymorphisms within subtype C RT did not alter either the direction or the magnitude of the effect of the resistance mutations K65R and M184V. The subtype C RT used in our experiments contains 33 amino acid polymorphisms that are different from the subtype B consensus sequence. Only the polymorphisms at positions 35, 36, 48 (in the fingers), 211, 214 (in the palm), and 245, 286 and 291 (in the thumb) are located close enough to the RT active site to have significant functional interactions with the fingers. However, such effects do not appear to be discernible by the methods used in our study. Hence, the overall effect of K65R in subtype C is to reduce susceptibility to TFV.</p><p>In the absence of biochemical evidence of an enzyme-dependent mechanism for the preferential emergence of K65R in HIV-1 subtype C, the possibility of a template-dependent mechanism is favoured as described by our laboratory elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Briefly, it seems that increased pausing is involved when RT copies a HIV-1 subtype C nucleic acid template at RT positions 64 through 66, due to the combined effect of low fidelity and NRTI pressure. This was shown to be true for reactions involving RT of either subtype B or C origin but only with template C sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Further virological tests, including competition assays, are warranted in order to detect more subtle effects of the K65R mutation in subtype C.</p><p>Based on standard genetic sequencing of HIV-1 RNA from plasma of treated patients, K65R and M184V can emerge in subtype C as in B viruses after therapeutic failure with ABC, ddI, TFV and d4T when combined with 3TC. The finding that both K65R and K65R/M184V decrease the enzymatic fitness of RT in subtype C HIV and that both restore susceptibility to ZDV in an additive manner is important in view of the ongoing switch in use of NRTI backbones away from thymidine analogs and the higher frequency of K65R in subtype C isolates from African patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Newer backbones (TFV/FTC and ABC/3TC) typically select for the K65R and M184V mutations in HIV-1 subtype B, but these mutations have also frequently emerged in subtype C viruses treated with d4T/3TC. As described here, these mutations cause loss of enzymatic fitness and might reduce the virulence of HIV-1.</p><p>Studies with both SIV and a RT SHIV in macaques treated with TFV monotherapy showed selection of the K70E and K65R mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. The viral load of the animals with virologic failure were about 10-fold below the pre-therapy set point, which might be related to loss of viral fitness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. Interestingly, the presence of TFV resistance mutations did not preclude virological suppression in several of the treated animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. A CD8-mediated immunologic response seemed to contribute to virologic suppression in animals harboring TFV-resistant viruses, but this only occurred if TFV was continuously administered.</p><p>We did not test whether thymidine analog resistance mutations (TAMs) affect subtype C RT enzymatic function. Therefore, we cannot comment on the extent to which TAMs might affect TFV incorporation or excision. However, research on this matter is warranted because TAMs also occur in NRTI-resistant subtype C viruses isolated from patients who have failed first line regimens in resource-limited settings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our results show that an enzyme-based mechanism is not the basis for the higher propensity of HIV-1 subtype C to acquire the K65R mutation in response to NRTI exposure and that subtype B and C RTs behave similarly in regard to most enzymatic properties. In particular, both enzymes, when containing K65R, share a diminished initiation efficiency at low dNTP concentrations as well as diminished rates of excision if K65R is present. Both subtype B and subtype C RTs containing K65R are less able to bind to TFV-DP and are less susceptible than WT RTs to the chain-terminating effects of this compound.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Chemicals and Nucleic Acids</title><p>Tenofovir diphosphate (TFV-DP) was kindly provided by Gilead Sciences (Foster City, California, USA).
