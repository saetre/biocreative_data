In this study, we show that an oxazoline analogue of apratoxin A (oz-apraA), a cyclodepsipeptide isolated from a marine cyanobacterium, promotes the degradation of Hsp90 clients through chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA). We identify a KFERQ-like motif as a conserved pentapeptide sequence in the kinase domain of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) necessary for recognition as a CMA substrate. Mutation of this motif prevents EGFR degradation by CMA and promotes the degradation of EGFR through the proteasomal pathway in oz-apraA&#x02013;treated cells. Oz-apraA binds to Hsc70/Hsp70. We propose that apratoxin A inhibits Hsp90 function by stabilizing the interaction of Hsp90 client proteins with Hsc70/Hsp70 and thus prevents their interactions with Hsp90. Our study provides the first examples for the ability of CMA to mediate degradation of membrane receptors and cross talks of CMA and proteasomal degradation mechanisms.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>The molecular chaperone Hsp90 (heat shock protein 90) maintains the conformation, stability, and activity of several key oncogenic proteins, such as EGF receptor (EGFR), cyclin-dependent kinases, Raf, and p53, which are collectively known as Hsp90 client proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Whitesell and Lindquist, 2005</xref>). The chaperone function of Hsp90 requires the formation of a multichaperone complex, which is dependent on the hydrolysis of ATP and ADP/ATP exchange. A geldanamycin (GA) analogue, which inhibits Hsp90 by blocking its intrinsic ATPase activity, was the first in class inhibitor of Hsp90 in human clinical trials for cancer therapy. Inhibition of Hsp90 function by GA disrupts the interaction of Hsp90 with its client proteins and leads to their proteasome pathway-dependent degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zhang and Burrows, 2004</xref>).</p><p>Autophagy mediates the bulk degradation of intracellular components such as macromolecule complexes and subcellular organelles through lysosomal-dependent mechanisms and is essential for the maintenance of cellular homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Meijer, 2003</xref>). Three modes of autophagy have been identified in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Levine and Klionsky, 2004</xref>). Macroautophagy cargo is sequestered into a specialized double-membrane structure called an autophagosome. Autophagosomes then fuse with lysosomes, and its content is subsequently degraded by hydrolytic enzymes. Microautophagy cargo is generated by direct budding of the lysosomal membrane. In chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA), substrates are recognized by a chaperone complex containing Hsc70 (heat shock cognate of 70 kD) and delivered into lysosomes through interactions with LAMP-2A (lysosome-associated membrane protein 2A). CMA is activated during prolonged nutrient deprivation, which results in the degradation of cytosolic proteins in a molecule by molecule fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dice, 2007</xref>). The relevance of CMA for mediating the degradation of noncytosolic proteins, if any, remains unknown.</p><p>Apratoxin A, a cyclodepsipeptide isolated from the marine cyanobacterium <italic>Lyngbya majuscula</italic>, exhibits cytotoxic activity against several cancer cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Luesch et al., 2006</xref>) and has shown to have some activity against colon adenocarcinoma C38-derived tumors in an in vivo study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Luesch et al., 2001</xref>). Apratoxin A was found to induce G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Luesch et al., 2006</xref>). However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms of apratoxin A remain unknown. Using the clues suggested by the gene expression signatures of apratoxin A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Luesch et al., 2006</xref>), we explored its mechanism of action using a synthetic oxazoline analogue of apratoxin A (oz-apraA). In this study, we demonstrate that oz-apraA modulates degradation of Hsp90 client proteins (e.g., EGFR and ErbB2) through the CMA pathway. We show that EGFR contains a KFERQ-like motif in its kinase domain, and oz-apraA&#x02013;induced EGFR degradation is dependent on LAMP-2A. Our study demonstrates a CMA-mediated mechanism for degradation of multiple Hsp90 client proteins, including membrane receptors in oz-apraA&#x02013;treated cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec><title>Impact of apratoxin A and its oxazoline analogue on Hsp90 chaperone complexes</title><p>To study the molecular mechanism of apratoxin A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>), we performed retrospective data mining by identifying the gene expression signature of apratoxin A (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200810183/DC1">Fig. S1 A</ext-link>) from a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Luesch et al., 2006</xref>) and compared it with gene expression signatures of different compounds in the Connectivity Map database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lamb et al., 2006</xref>). The apratoxin A signatures from 3- and 6-h treatment exhibited a high degree of similarity to the gene expression profile from the well-established Hsp90 inhibitor 17-allylamino-GA (<italic>n</italic> = 18, P &#x0003c; 0.001; Fig. S1 B). Consistent with an effect on protein chaperones, apratoxin A significantly induced expression of several heat shock&#x02013;responsive genes, including HSPA1B, DNAJB1, HSPA6, DDIT4, DNAJB9, and BAG3 (Fig. S1 A and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200810183/DC1">Tables S1</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200810183/DC1">S2</ext-link>). We reperformed the analysis of apratoxin A signatures by removing heat shock&#x02013;responsive genes to exclude toxicological effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Meyer et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Schiaffonati and Tiberio, 1997</xref>). The signature of apratoxin A treatment with heat shock&#x02013;responsive genes subtracted also showed high similarity to that of Hsp90 inhibitors (Fig. S1 C). Because immediate cellular responses are more likely to be the result of direct interaction with the primary targets, we hypothesize that the mechanism of apratoxin A action might share similarity to that of GA and act by modulating Hsp90 complex formation with its client proteins.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Apratoxin A and its analogue inhibit the Hsp90 pathway.</bold> (A) Chemical structure of the compounds.

Because our previous work demonstrated that oz-apraA, which has similar potency with respect to tumor toxicity as apratoxin A, could be obtained through total synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ma et al., 2006</xref>), we next examined the impact of oz-apraA on activation of the Hsp90 pathway.</p><p>We first determined the effect of oz-apraA on the protein levels of the Hsp90 client proteins. Treatment with oz-apraA led to concentration- and time-dependent reductions in the protein levels of known Hsp90 clients, EGFR, ErbB2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref> and Fig. S1 D), and RIP-1 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 D</xref>). In A549 cells, wild-type EGFR is more sensitive to oz-apraA than to GA. Although, in MDA-MB-453 cells, the treatment with 10 nM oz-apraA or GA for 24 h led to a similar reduction in the levels of ErbB2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>, bottom). Oz-apraA treatment also led to a dose-dependent increase in the levels of Hsp70 (Hsp/Hsc70), as detected by an antibody recognizing both Hsp70 and Hsc70, but to a lesser extent than that with GA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>). We further tested whether oz-apraA had any effect on the half-life of EGFR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>). Although the levels of EGFR did not change appreciably over 24 h in the presence of cycloheximide (CHX) alone, in the presence of oz-apraA and CHX, a reduction in the levels of EGFR was first detected at 8 h. By 24 h, &#x0003c;20% remained. In contrast, oz-apraA had no effect on the turnover of interleukin 6 signal transducer GP130 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>) or the turnover of pEGFP-CL1 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3 D</xref>), suggesting that oz-apraA does not directly inhibit proteasome activity. Furthermore, &#x0223c;500 nM oz-apraA or up to 1 &#x000b5;M GA had no effect on the levels of FGFR1, a non-Hsp90 client membrane receptor (Fig. S1 E; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Citri et al., 2006</xref>). From these results, we conclude that oz-apraA specifically reduces the levels of at least a subset of Hsp90 client proteins.</p><p>The GA class of Hsp90 inhibitors binds to the N-terminal ATP-binding site of Hsp90 with higher affinity than that of natural nucleotides and thus abrogates the formation of Hsp90 chaperone&#x02013;client protein complexes by preventing exchange of ADP for ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Whitesell and Lindquist, 2005</xref>). To determine whether oz-apraA also disrupts the interaction of Hsp90 with its client proteins, we examined the interaction of Hsp90 with ErbB2 by coimmunoprecipitation. We found that like GA, treatment of MDA-MB-453 cells with oz-apraA reduced the interaction of Hsp90 with its client protein, ErbB2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>). Furthermore, in the presence of 100 nM oz-apraA, the interaction of Hsp90 with ErbB2 in SKoV3 cell lysates was inhibited to the same extent as in cells treated with 1 &#x000b5;M GA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 E</xref>). From these data, we conclude that oz-apraA can inhibit the physical interactions of Hsp90 with at least a subset of its clients.</p></sec><sec><title>Oz-apraA&#x02013;binding proteins</title><p>To identify oz-apraA target proteins, we generated a biotin derivative of oz-apraA (bio&#x02013;oz-apraA) with a spacer at position 26 of <italic>O</italic>-methyl-tyrosine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>). This compound was assembled by a click reaction of a biotin-embodied azide with alkynyl&#x02013;oz-apraA; a new analogue of oz-apraA was synthesized based on our previous procedure. Our early study indicated that modification of the tyrosine tail might have little influence to the biological activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ma et al., 2006</xref>). As desired, bio&#x02013;oz-apraA remains as active as unsubstituted oz-apraA and induces the degradation of EGFR in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig. S1 F). Using bio&#x02013;oz-apraA conjugated with streptavidin-agarose, affinity pull-down assays were performed with lysates of HeLa or HEK293 cells. Proteins with an apparent molecular mass of &#x0223c;70 kD were specifically pulled down with bio&#x02013;oz-apraA, and this 70-kD protein was competed away by excess oz-apraA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>, lanes 2 and 3). Using mass spectrometry, the 70-kD band was identified as proteins of the Hsp70 family, including HSPA8 (which encodes an Hsc70) and HSPA1B (which encodes an inducible Hsp70; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 B</xref>). Other identified oz-apraA&#x02013;binding proteins include RARS (arginyl-tRNA synthetase protein) and SRP68 (signal recognition particle protein 68). RARS, a member of the class I aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase family, has been reported to be associated with Hsp90 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kang et al., 2000</xref>). SRP68, a ribonucleoprotein in the signal peptide recognition particle, is involved in docking the nascent polypeptide&#x02013;ribosome complex at receptors on the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Politz et al., 2000</xref>). We concentrated further analysis on Hsp70/Hsc70 because they are cochaperones for Hsp90 and are directly involved in folding of Hsp90 client proteins.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p><bold>Oz-apraA&#x02013;binding proteins.</bold> (A) Brief synthetic steps of bio&#x02013;oz-apraA.

The binding of bio&#x02013;oz-apraA with Hsp70/Hsc70 binding is specific, as it can be competed away with excessive oz-apraA. To directly analyze the interaction of bio&#x02013;oz-apraA with Hsp70 and Hsc70, we next transiently transfected HEK293 cells with pcDNA-HA-Hsp70 or pcDNA-HA-Hsc70 and repeated the pull-down assay followed by Western blotting with an anti-HA antibody. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 D</xref>, bio&#x02013;oz-apraA can bind to both Hsp70 and Hsc70, and this binding can be competed away by excessive oz-apraA, which is consistent with the results of the pull-down assay for endogenous Hsp70/Hsc70. However, no direct interaction of Hsp90 with bio&#x02013;oz-apraA was detected using a similar assay (unpublished data). Thus, we conclude that oz-apraA can bind to Hsp70/Hsc70 but not Hsp90. Interestingly, binding of oz-apraA to Hsp70/Hsc70 may also disrupt the interaction of Hsp70/Hsc70 with Hsp90 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200810183/DC1">Fig. S2</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec><title>Oz-apraA induces the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins and the formation of aggresome</title><p>Because the inhibition of Hsp90 by GA has been shown to promote ubiquitination of Hsp90 client proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Xu et al., 2002</xref>), we asked whether there was also an increase in the levels of ubiquitinated proteins in oz-apraA&#x02013;treated cells.

Promoting the degradation of Hsp90 client proteins, many of which are important positive regulators of cell growth and proliferation, provides the key underlying mechanism for the success of anti-Hsp90 therapy. We demonstrate in this study that oz-apraA also specifically and potently induces the degradation of at least a subset of Hsp90 client proteins. Although most of the known inhibitors of Hsp90 function by interrupting the intrinsic ATPase activity of Hsp90 and promoting the degradation of the client proteins via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, we show that oz-apraA induces the degradation of Hsp90 client proteins through CMA, a lysosomal degradation mechanism distinct from proteasome-dependent mechanisms. Our study provides the first example for the ability of CMA to mediate the degradation of membrane receptors and the cross talk of CMA and proteasomal degradation mechanisms.</p><p>The Hsp90 chaperone&#x02013;client protein cycle involves successive association and dissociation of several cochaperones to form various multimeric protein complexes and is dictated by the ATP-binding state of Hsp90. A client protein initially associates with an Hsp70&#x02013;Hsp40 complex and is then bound to Hsp90 via HOP (Hsp90/Hsp70-organizing protein). A conformational change in Hsp90, induced by ATP hydrolysis, leads to the release of Hsp70&#x02013;Hsp40 and HOP and association of other cochaperones to form a mature complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sharp and Workman, 2006</xref>). Increased association of Hsp70 with Hsp90 client proteins in cells treated with GA might reflect an inability to release the cochaperones from Hsp90 client proteins. By the same analogy, the increased association of not only Hsp70 but also Hsc70 with Hsp90 client proteins in cells treated with oz-apraA suggests that at least a subpopulation of Hsp90 client proteins might regularly interact with Hsc70.</p><p>Although Hsc70 and Hsp70 are highly homologous (86% identity in amino acid sequence), only Hsc70 but not Hsp70 has been implicated in mediating CMA as a molecular chaperone that stimulates cargo protein translocation across membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bandyopadhyay and Cuervo, 2008</xref>). Hsc70 is constitutively expressed and has also been found to be a part of Hsp90 complex and interact with HOP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gebauer et al., 1997</xref>). Interestingly, Hsp90 megacomplexes, including Hsp90, Hsp40, HOP, Hsp70-interacting protein, and BAG-1 (Bcl-2&#x02013;associated athanogene 1 protein), were found to be associated with the cytosolic side of the lysosomal membrane in cells under prolonged starvation condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agarraberes and Dice, 2001</xref>). Thus, the cells may target the Hsp90 client proteins for degradation through lysosomal pathway under nutrient-limiting conditions.</p><p>A previous study has reported that the increase in total proteolysis induced by GA is reduced by the treatment of NH<sub>4</sub>Cl but not by 3-methyladenine, which inhibits macroautophagy but not CMA, which has led <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Finn et al. (2005)</xref> to suggest that GA also stimulates CMA. However, because a relatively high concentration of GA (2 &#x000b5;M) was used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Finn et al. (2005)</xref>, the apparent induction of CMA might be a result of toxicity rather than a direct result of inhibiting Hsp90. Because the degradation of a vast majority of Hsp90 client proteins induced by GA depends on the proteasomal pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zhang and Burrows, 2004</xref>) and because we found that GA does not induce the association of Hsc70 and Hsp90 client proteins, we propose that GA does not directly promote CMA.</p><p>Another recent study has reported that the GA-induced degradation of IKK, which is also an Hsp90 client protein, is mediated by the macroautophagic pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Qing et al., 2006</xref>). In this case, the degradation of IKK was found to require Atg5, a gene required for macroautophagy but not for CMA. However, because a high concentration of 10 &#x000b5;M GA was used in this study, it is also possible that the toxicity of GA activates macroautophagy, which in turn promotes the degradation of IKK.</p><p>The EGFR family of receptors (EGFR [ErbB1], ErbB2, ErbB3, and ErbB4) are important regulators of normal growth and differentiation. Antagonizing the functions of EGFR family of receptors has been an important therapeutic strategy for the treatment of cancers. Oz-apraA&#x02013;induced EGFR degradation requires the <sub>756</sub>NKEIL<sub>760</sub> peptide for degradation through CMA. Interestingly, in a genomic screen for somatic cancer mutations from a subset of 58 nonsmall cell lung cancer samples that included 41 lung adenocarcinomas, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Paez et al. (2004)</xref> identified 10 tumor samples that carried small deletions in EGFR for codons 746&#x02013;750 (Del-1) and one tumor sample that carried a deletion of 752&#x02013;759 (Del-2; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200810183/DC1">Table S3</ext-link>), which deleted most of the CMA recognition sequence identified by us. Although the potential significance of such deletions for the degradation of EGFR through CMA remains to be examined in future studies, we propose that degradation of EGFR through CMA might serve as a tumor suppressor mechanism by down-regulating EGFR levels.</p><p>Both GA and oz-apraA can induce the down-regulation of EGFR protein levels but through distinct mechanisms. Such down-regulation of EGFR may occur during the folding and ER-Golgi transport process before localization on the plasma membrane. Misfolded membrane proteins are known to be retro transported from the ER to the cytosol through ER-associated degradation and degraded through proteasomal pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Strous and Gent, 2002</xref>). The ability of oz-apraA to induce the appearance of aggresomes without impairing the function of proteasomes is consistent with a significant increase in the retro transport of misfolded proteins from the ER to the cytosol through ER-associated degradation. Alternatively, oz-apraA&#x02013;induced down-regulation of EGFR may occur after ligand binding and receptor activation during receptor recycling and degradation process, which is mediated through clathrin-coated endocytic vesicles and subsequent fusion with early endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2008">Roepstorff et al., 2008</xref>). The ability of oz-apraA to dramatically stimulate the polyubiquitination of EGFR in an NH<sub>4</sub>Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup>-sensitive manner is also consistent with the possibility that oz-apraA may be able to promote the polyubiquitination and degradation of ligand-bound EGFR. The exact form of EGFR that is degraded after oz-apraA treatment needs to be further characterized.</p><p>The existence of cross talks between different forms of autophagy pathways has been proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Massey et al. (2006a)</xref>. It was reported that the cells with impaired CMA function were able to maintain homeostatic protein degradation through up-regulation of macroautophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Massey et al., 2006b</xref>). Thus, inhibition of macroautophagy by oz-apraA at later time points may also contribute to further induction of CMA. Although the molecular mechanism that mediates the cross talk of macroautophagy and CMA is not yet clear, Hsc70, a cytosolic chaperone essential for translocation of substrates via CMA, has been proposed as a good candidate for acting as a cross-talking molecule. Because experimental loading of CMA-incompetent lysosomes with Hsc70 is sufficient to activate CMA capability, increased expression or localization of Hsc70 within a particular subcellular area may activate CMA. We propose that an increased interaction of EGFR with Hsc70 induced by oz-apraA is sufficient to promote the degradation of EGFR through the CMA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title/><sec><title>Cells and reagents</title><p>A549, MDA-MB-453, HEK293, SKoV3, and H4 cells were cultured in DME containing 10% FCS (Hyclone).
