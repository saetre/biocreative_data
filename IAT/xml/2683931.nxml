We have previously isolated a panel of <italic>spi-1</italic> transgenic erythroleukemic cell lines that proliferated in the presence of either erythropoietin (Epo) or stem cell factor (SCF). Using these cell lines, we observed that EpoR stimulation by Epo down-regulated expression of the SCF receptor Kit and induced expression of the Src kinase Lyn. Furthermore, enforced expression of Lyn in the cell lines increased cell proliferation in response to Epo, but reduced cell growth in response to SCF in accordance with Lyn ability to down-regulate Kit expression. Together, the data suggest that Epo-R/Lyn signaling pathway is essential for extinction of SCF signaling leading the proerythroblast to strict Epo dependency. These results highlight a new role for Lyn as an effector of EpoR in controlling Kit expression. They suggest that Lyn may play a central role in during erythroid differentiation at the switch between proliferation and maturation.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Erythropoiesis is critically regulated by a number of growth factors acting through specific receptors, among which erythropoietin (Epo) and stem cell factor (SCF) are essential factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005721-Munugalavadla1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. SCF, the ligand for the Kit receptor, is mainly involved in the survival and proliferation of immature erythroid progenitors, whereas Epo is the predominant regulator preventing apoptosis at the CFU-E/proerythroblast stage of differentiation. The importance of the SCF/Kit pathway during erythropoiesis was highlighted in mice with inactivating mutation in the SCF (Sl/Sl mice) or Kit gene (W/W mice) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005721-Nocka1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005721-Geissler1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.

Fetal livers from these mice contain BFU-E and CFU-E progenitors, although in reduced number, indicating that the Epo/EpoR pathway is crucial in regulating survival, proliferation and terminal differentiation of CFU-E <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005721-Wu1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>.

Starting from this observation, we investigated the molecular mechanisms controlling the expression of Kit and EpoR. We show that Epo down-regulated Kit expression and induced expression of the Lyn kinase. When ectopically expressed in <italic>spi</italic>-transgenic proerythroblasts, Lyn favored cell proliferation in response to Epo, but not to SCF. These biological effects are consistent with the ability of Lyn to induce a down-regulation of Kit expression. Our findings reveal a novel aspect of signaling crosstalk between Kit and EpoR and highlight a central role for Lyn in SCF signaling extinction at the CFU-E/proerythroblast stage.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Cell lines and proliferation assays</title><p>The <italic>spi-1</italic>-transgenic proerythroblastic cell lines (633, 663, 812) have been previously described in details <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005721-MoreauGachelin1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>.

To gain insights into the possible causes leading to proliferation rate disparity, we analyzed the expression level of receptors for Epo (EpoR) and SCF (Kit) by immunoblotting. Different levels of EpoR expression were detected in each cell line, but these levels were comparable whether the cells were cultured with Epo or SCF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005721-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Unexpectedly, the highest EpoR levels were seen in 812 cells that proliferated poorly in response to Epo.

P-Stat5 was undetectable in cells grown with SCF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005721-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Next, we analyzed Kit expression levels in the 3 cell lines grown under the 2 cytokines conditions. Clearly, Kit levels were high in cells exhibiting a robust proliferative response to SCF (cell lines 633 and 663). As a read out for Kit activity, detection of the phosphorylated-Y719-Kit form was performed by immunoblotting. P-Y719-Kit was clearly seen in all cells grown with SCF, but not in Epo-cultured cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005721-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Strikingly, total Kit expression levels were significantly higher in cells grown with SCF compared to cells grown with Epo. Modulation in Kit expression was also detected at the surface of cells grown with Epo or SCF by flow cytometry analysis. The mean Kit-specific fluorescence (MFI) level was increased about 2.5 fold in 663 and 812 cells cultured with SCF compared to cells grown with Epo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005721-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Similar results were obtained for 633 cells (data not shown).

Reciprocally, Kit levels were decreased when cells were switched from SCF to Epo for 48 hrs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005721-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). These variations in Kit expression were also detected at the cell surface by flow cytometry analysis. The Kit-specific MFI was increased when cells were switched from Epo to SCF and conversely was decreased after switching from SCF to Epo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005721-g003">Figures 3A, 3B</xref>). When cells continuously grown with SCF were switched to various concentrations of Epo for 48 hrs, Kit expression levels were reduced in an Epo-dose dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005721-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). The rapid up or down modulation of Kit levels in response to cytokine changes, the absence of cell death (data not shown) during cytokine changes and the reversibility of the phenomenon indicated that they did not result from a selection process. We thus concluded that activation of Epo-R could mediate a fine regulation on Kit expression.</p><fig id="pone-0005721-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0005721.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Reversible down-regulation of Kit in response to Epo.</title><p>Switch from Epo to SCF (A) and switch from SCF to Epo (B): 663 and 812 cells continuously cultured with Epo (1 U/mL) or SCF (100 ng/mL) were extensively washed with medium without cytokine and then expanded for 48 hrs with SCF (100 ng/mL) or Epo (1 U/mL), respectively.

In contrast, no differences in Lck and Src expressions were observed that cells were cultured with either Epo or SCF (data not shown). Of note, Lyn expression profiles differed in each cell lines and correlated with EpoR expression levels. Thus, we investigated whether Epo could regulate Lyn expression. SCF-cultured cells were extensively washed in culture medium with no cytokine and then cultured for 48 hrs in the presence of increasing Epo concentrations.

Likewise, P-Stat5 activation levels increased with Epo concentration. Thus, Epo induced both Lyn expression and Stat5 activation in a dose-dependent manner.

Thus, the intracellular presence of Lyn was not compatible with the expansion of proerythroblastic cells in the presence of SCF. This result is consistent with the ability of Lyn to down-regulate Kit expression.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>During erythropoiesis, SCF and Epo tightly control the pool size of erythroid progenitor cells that will survive, divide or differentiate. From CFU-E to erythroblasts, the subtle balance between Epo and SCF responses results from a gradual decline of Kit expression associated to an increase in EpoR expression. However, the signaling mechanisms underlying the down-regulation of Kit and the up-regulation of EpoR are poorly understood, mainly because of the poor accessibility, the rarity and the transience of the CFU-E. The <italic>spi-1</italic> transgenic proerythroblasts no longer undergo differentiation and are arrested at the CFU-E/proerythroblast transition, but these cells retain their dependency to Epo or SCF for survival and proliferation. This experimental system, in which expansion is uncoupled from maturation, was used to examine the mechanisms controlling the proliferative responses of proerythroblasts to Epo or SCF. We show that Epo down-regulates Kit expression and that Lyn kinase behaves as a mediator of SCF signaling through controlling Kit expression.</p><p>The proerythroblastic cell lines derived from the spleen of diseased <italic>spi-1</italic> transgenic mice are morphologically <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005721-MoreauGachelin1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref> and cytologically (our unpublished data) similar, and resemble CFU-E/proerythroblastic cells. They have intrinsic proliferative capacities and express Kit and EpoR at different levels. This heterogeneity may reflect subtle differences in the level at which the maturation arrest provoked by the overexpression of the <italic>spi-1</italic> transgene occurred and/or to genetic or epigenetic variability in the cell lines.</p><p>We took advantage of this heterogeneity to investigate the molecular processes involved in the control of Kit and EpoR expression in response to their cognate ligands. Each cell line (six were studied and three are shown) had a proliferation rate in the presence of SCF that was correlated with the level of Kit expression. However, we observed that Kit levels were modulated by the cytokine used to expand the cells (Epo <italic>versus</italic> SCF) and that this modulation was rapidly reversible by a change in cytokine. Modifications in Kit levels were detected both in whole cell extracts and at the cell surface indicating that they <italic>in fine</italic> may lead to a modified response to SCF. The variations in surface expression of Kit analyzed by flow cytometry were significantly lower than that of total amount of cellular Kit analyzed by SDS-PAGE. These differences might be a consequence of the occurrence of Kit receptor internalization following SCF-induced activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005721-Broudy1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005721-Jahn1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. Because of the unavailability of EpoR antibodies for flow cytometric analysis, determination of the cell surface expression of EpoR was not performed. However, no obvious variation in EpoR expression could be detected in whole cell extracts whether cells were stimulated with Epo or SCF. The high Kit level in SCF-cultured cells was reminiscent of a mechanism involving SCF as a modulator of its own receptor expression as described for IL-3, CSF-1 and GM-CSF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005721-Panterne1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. In contrast, we observed that Kit expression was down-regulated by Epo and that this down-regulation was inhibited by AG490, an inhibitor of EpoR signaling.</p><p>During hematopoiesis, Kit is expressed in immature and lineage progenitors and is down-regulated upon terminal erythroid differentiation.

Another process refers to the down-regulation of Kit activation by negative effectors such as the SH2-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005721-Kozlowski1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. Such mechanisms can be ruled in our system since Kit down-regulation was seen in the absence of SCF, when cells were grown with Epo. Others mechanisms involve a regulatory control at the <italic>Kit</italic> transcriptional level. In erythropoiesis, transcription factors such as Tal-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005721-Vitelli1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref> and GATA-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005721-Munugalavadla2">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005721-Jing1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref> are repressors of <italic>Kit</italic> transcriptional expression. Our RT-PCR experiments revealed evident differences in <italic>Kit</italic> transcripts levels in cells cultured with Epo compared to cells cultured with SCF, a higher expression of <italic>Kit</italic> transcripts being detected in SCF-cultured cells. Though changes in mRNA stability are an alternate mechanism to explain a variation in mRNA amount, it is attempting to speculate that a transcriptional mechanism is most probably involved in the regulation of Kit expression in proerythroblastic cells. More investigations are required to characterize such a mechanism. Our findings of the down-regulation of Kit expression by Epo in the context of a late erythroid progenitor at the transition CFU-E/proerythroblast highlight that Epo is capable to switch off the expression of Kit in maturing erythroblasts. This process may also limit the cooperation between the two cytokines for proerythroblast proliferation and survival.</p><p>Several laboratories have described synergistic features between Kit and EpoR co-signaling to maintain the growth and survival of erythroid progenitors <italic>in vitro</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005721-Wu2">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005721-vonLindern1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>.

Finally, in the human hematopoietic stem cell-like cell line HML/SE, stimulation of Kit by SCF activates transcription of the <italic>EpoR</italic> gene making the cells responsive to Epo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005721-Sato1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. Similarly, we observed a cooperative effect between Epo and SCF for the survival and proliferation of <italic>spi-1</italic> transgenic proerythroblasts. It should be noted that cooperation was seen only at a limiting Epo concentration when Kit expression was up-regulated. In contrast, when Epo was used at a suboptimal concentration (1 U/mL) in combination with SCF, Epo was the only player in controlling cell proliferation. It is reasonable to propose that the down-regulation of Kit expression leads to the loss of SCF responsiveness. In this regard, SCF and Epo cooperation would be restricted to early stages of erythropoiesis when Kit level is high. This agrees with data localizing the physical interaction of Kit and EpoR before or at the CFU-E stage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005721-Wu3">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref> and with results indicating that elevated levels of Epo abolish the requirement for SCF-mediated signals in <italic>in vivo</italic> erythropoiesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005721-Waskow1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Our findings add to our knowledge of Lyn action in erythropoiesis.

Our findings show that Lyn sustains the Epo-dependent proliferation agreeing with a role of Lyn in the proliferation of late erythroid precursor cells. Furthermore, ectopic Lyn overexpression in SCF-cultured cells resulted in a reduction in Kit expression making cells poorly responsive to SCF. This observation underlines a dual role for Lyn as a positive effector in Epo signaling and a negative effector in Kit signaling and presents Lyn as a major mediator of the balance between Epo and SCF responsiveness during proliferation of proerythroblastic cells.</p><p>Stat5 phosphorylation is induced by Epo in erythroid cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005721-Gouilleux1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005721-Penta1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref> and this activation depends on kinases associated with EpoR: the Jak2 kinase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005721-Witthuhn1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref> and tyrosine kinases of the Src family such as Lyn in murine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005721-Tilbrook1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005721-Chin1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref> and Src in human erythroblasts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005721-Kubota1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005721-Okutani1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>.

Similarly, we found that Stat5 was not activated by SCF in <italic>spi-1</italic> transgenic proerythroblasts. In contrast, Stat5 was activated by Epo. Because phosphorylated Stat5 levels in cells cultured under Epo paralleled the expression level of Lyn, a prediction could be that Stat5 was an effector downstream of Lyn in Epo-dependent proliferation of cells. Though Stat5 has been characterized as a direct substrat for Lyn during Epo-induced differentiation of the J2E cell line <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005721-Tilbrook1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, it is not determined whether Lyn induces similar signaling during cell proliferation in response to Epo. Alternatively, Lyn was an Epo-responsive gene and could be a Stat5 transcriptional target gene. Induction of Lyn protein expression by Epo was associated to induction of RNA expression. Further investigation is required to know whether Stat5 controls the transcription of Lyn through direct binding to its transcriptional promoter.</p><p>In conclusion, our findings on the down-regulation of Kit expression by the EpoR/Lyn pathway in the context of a late erythroid progenitor cell (CFU-E/proerythroblast transition) provide some insights into the mechanisms leading to Kit extinction in maturing erythroblasts. We postulate that the control of Kit expression during erythroid development results from interference between Epo and SCF signaling where activation of the EpoR/Lyn pathway would lead the proerythroblast to the strict Epo dependency through mediating extinction of Kit expression. In this light, it will be interesting to determine if such a down-regulation of the activity of a cytokine active on early multipotent progenitors by a cytokine active later on the maturation of a lineage specific progenitor illustrates a general process in the hematopoietic development.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank Z.
