Unwinding of double-stranded DNA is essential for the processes of DNA repair, recombination, transcription, and DNA replication. Five human DNA helicases sharing sequence similarity with the <italic>E. coli</italic> RecQ helicase have been identified. Three of the human RecQ helicases are implicated in hereditary diseases (Bloom syndrome, Werner syndrome, and Rothmund-Thomson syndrome) which display clinical symptoms of premature aging and cancer. RECQ1 helicase is the most highly expressed of the human RecQ helicases; however, a genetic disease has yet not been linked to mutations in the <italic>RECQ1</italic> gene, and the biological functions of human RECQ1 in cellular DNA metabolism are not known.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>In this study, we report that RECQ1 becomes phosphorylated upon DNA damage and forms irradiation-induced nuclear foci that associate with chromatin in human cells. Depletion of RECQ1 renders human cells sensitive to DNA damage induced by ionizing radiation or the topoisomerase inhibitor camptothecin, and results in spontaneous &#x003b3;-H2AX foci and elevated sister chromatid exchanges, indicating aberrant repair of DNA breaks. Consistent with a role in homologous recombinational repair, endogenous RECQ1 is associated with the strand exchange protein Rad51 and the two proteins directly interact with high affinity.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion/Significance</title><p>Collectively, these results provide the first evidence for a role of human RECQ1 in the response to DNA damage and chromosomal stability maintenance and point to the vital importance of RECQ1 in genome homeostasis.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="15"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>It is believed that RecQ helicases have multiple roles in three facets of DNA metabolism (repair, replication and recombination), S-phase checkpoint, and telomere maintenance; consequently, they are considered caretakers of the genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001297-Hickson1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001297-Sharma1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Three of the five human RecQ genes, designated <italic>BLM, WRN</italic> and <italic>RECQ4,</italic> have been genetically linked to the autosomal recessive diseases Bloom Syndrome (BS), Werner Syndrome (WS) and Rothmund-Thomson Syndrome (RTS), respectively. All three of these rare human diseases are characterized by a predisposition to cancer and chromosome instability, but the clinical features and cellular phenotypes are different from each other, suggesting unique roles of BLM, WRN, and RECQ4 helicases as tumor suppressors.</p><p>The biological significance of the remaining two human RecQ helicases, RECQ1 and RECQ5, is not yet known. The <italic>RECQ1 (RECQL)</italic> gene, originally cloned independently by two groups <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001297-Puranam1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001297-Seki1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, is located on chromosome 12p11-12 and encodes a 649 amino acid protein with a molecular mass of 73 kDa. RECQ1 was found to be the most abundant of the five human RecQ helicases in resting B cells, and its expression is upregulated in response to EBV transformation or treatment with the tumor promoting agent phorbol myristic acetate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001297-Kawabe1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Despite the fact that RECQ1 was the first human RecQ helicase protein to be identified, little is known about its genetic functions in mammalian cells. Studies utilizing chicken DT40 cells have shown that RECQ1 and RECQ5 have roles in cell viability under a BLM-impaired condition, indicating a backup function for these helicases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001297-Wang1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. However, BLM, RECQ5, and RECQL have nonredundant roles in suppressing crossovers in mouse embryonic stem cells and fibroblasts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001297-Hu1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001297-Sharma2">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>, suggesting a cell type or species-specific difference between the chicken and mouse systems.</p><p>In order to better understand and appreciate the molecular-genetic functions of RECQ1, its biochemical properties and protein interactions have been studied. RECQ1 is a nonprocessive helicase that unwinds dsDNA with a 3&#x02032; to 5&#x02032; polarity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001297-Cui1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>.

In addition to its helicase activity, RECQ1 efficiently catalyzes strand annealing of complementary ssDNA molecules in a reaction that is modulated by nucleotide binding to RECQ1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001297-Sharma3">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. It was recently shown that RECQ1 assumes different oligomeric forms to perform its helicase and strand annealing activities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001297-Muzzolini1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. The human single-stranded DNA binding protein Replication Protein A (RPA) modulates RECQ1 catalytic activities. By binding to ssDNA, RPA inhibits RECQ1 strand annealing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001297-Sharma3">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. In contrast, RPA stimulates RECQ1 unwinding activity in a specific manner which is likely mediated by a physical interaction with the RPA70 subunit <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001297-Cui2">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. RECQ1 binds to human mismatch repair factors (MSH2-MSH6, MLH1-PMS2, EXO-1) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001297-Doherty1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. A functional importance for the physical protein interactions was evidenced by the abilities of RECQ1 to stimulate the endo- and exo-nucleolytic incision activities of EXO-1 and MSH2-MSH6 to enhance RECQ1 helicase activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001297-Doherty1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. RECQ1 was also reported to be associated with the Type IA Topoisomerase III&#x003b1; (Topo III&#x003b1;) in human cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001297-Johnson1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Although the catalytic activities and protein interactions of RECQ1 suggest its involvement in the regulation of genetic recombination at some level, the precise roles of RECQ1 in cellular DNA metabolism are not understood.</p><p>In this study, we have investigated the potential importance of human RECQ1 in the DNA damage response and maintenance of chromosomal stability. In response to ionizing radiation (IR)-induced DNA damage, RECQ1 helicase undergoes sub-nuclear redistribution, protein phosphorylation, and preferential association with chromatin. RECQ1 depletion by RNA interference resulted in reduced cell proliferation, compromised cellular resistance to IR or camptothecin (CPT), and elevated sister chromatid exchange (SCE) in cells either untreated or exposed to CPT, suggesting that RECQ1 is important for the repair of endogenous or exogenously induced DNA damage.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Recombinant proteins</title><p>Recombinant human RECQ1 helicase was overexpressed in insect cells using a baculovirus encoding recombinant RECQ1 kindly provided by Dr. Alessandro Vindigni (International Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Trieste, Italy) and purified as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001297-Sharma3">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>.

In this work, we have demonstrated that endogenous human RECQ1 becomes phosphorylated and re-localizes its sub-nuclear distribution to the chromatin fraction upon cellular exposure to DNA damage. Depletion of RECQ1 renders cells sensitive to IR or the topoisomerase inhibitor CPT, and results in spontaneous &#x003b3;-H2AX foci and elevated SCE, indicating an accumulation of double strand breaks. The biological results suggest that RECQ1 either serves to prevent double strand breaks from forming or directly helps to repair double strand breaks through its interaction with HR repair proteins such as Rad51. Collectively, these studies provide the first evidence for a role of human RECQ1 in the response to DNA damage and chromosomal stability maintenance and point to the vital importance of RECQ1 in genome homeostasis.</p><p>The significant reduction in cell proliferation due to RECQ1 depletion in human cells is different from that observed in mice in which RECQ1 deficiency had no obvious effect on the growth/proliferation of mouse embryonic fibroblasts nor the normal development or postnatal growth of mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001297-Sharma2">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. The phenotypes of complete loss of human RECQ1 are likely to be more severe than those observed, particularly in the case of shRNA selection, since that protocol presumably selects for clones that fail to completely silence RECQ1. This allows the possibility that RECQ1 is essential for cell viability in humans, in contrast to the case in mice.</p><p>It is conceivable that manifestation of cellular or organismal phenotypes in <italic>Recql</italic>-null mice may be masked by other genetic factors. For example, <italic>WRN</italic>-null mice do not exhibit any phenotypes prevalent in WS; however, premature aging phenotypes are observed in a <italic>WRN</italic>-null telomerase-knockout mouse characterized by the presence of critically short telomeres (for review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001297-Multani1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>). Furthermore, late generation <italic>mTerc-/- WRN -/-</italic> mouse embryonic fibroblasts have an increased load of DNA damage and replicative senescence, properties similar to that observed in human WS fibroblasts.</p><p>In addition to their growth defects, RECQ1-depleted human cells display defective maintenance of the G2/M checkpoint following IR exposure and an aberrant apoptotic response to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced stress. The role of RECQ1 in the apoptotic response may be either direct or the effect could be secondary, and the reduction in genotoxic stress-induced apoptosis could be due to the altered cell cycle distribution or viability of the RECQ1-depleted cells.</p><p>Intra-nuclear trafficking of nuclear proteins is an important aspect of the DNA damage response since DNA repair factors are known to localize to DNA damage foci. RECQ1 is predominantly found in the nucleoli of proliferating human cells and re-localizes to the nucleoplasm in response to IR-induced DNA damage or replicational stress induced by hydroxyurea. Like RECQ1, WRN and BLM also re-localize to the nucleoplasm after DNA damage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001297-Bischof1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001297-Marciniak1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>; however, RECQ4 is constitutively present in nuclear foci irrespective of DNA damage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001297-Petkovic1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>, suggesting some differences in the sub-cellular distribution of human RecQ helicases before and after DNA damage.</p><p>Most of the RECQ1 is loosely tethered to the nucleus; however, a subset of RECQ1 molecules becomes resistant to detergent extraction after IR exposure, probably due to their tighter association with sites of damage in chromatin. Endogenous RECQ1 is phosphorylated in response to DNA damage or replicational stress, and preferentially associates with chromatin. A number of predicted phosphorylation sites for various stress-activated kinases exist in RECQ1. Our unpublished results indicate that RECQ1 is phosphorylated after DNA damage in AT mutated cells, suggesting that ATM is not the major candidate kinase. <italic>In vitro</italic> phosphorylation of RECQ1 by Protein Kinase C or Casein Kinase II modulates its catalytic activities (data not shown). RECQ1 and its protein partners may be localized to sites of DNA damage where RECQ1 utilizes its catalytic activities to process genomic DNA structures as a component of the DNA damage response.</p><p>In agreement with this, RECQ1 deficiency in both mouse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001297-Sharma2">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref> and human cells resulted in an increased sensitivity to IR or CPT which introduce strand breaks that can be converted to double strand breaks during replication.

Thus, RECQ1 may have a direct role in repairing double strand breaks. Alternatively, RECQ1 may act to prevent double strand breaks from occurring in the first place. The latter explanation would be consistent with our observation that only a minority of RECQ1 co-localizes with &#x003b3;&#x02212;H2AX foci. The sensitivity of RECQ1 deficient cells to other DNA damaging agents remains unexplored and RECQ1 might also participate in other DNA repair pathways.</p><p>Strong candidates for RECQ1 protein interactors that serve to suppress cross-over of sister chromatids are recombination proteins, mismatch repair factors that regulate genetic recombination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001297-Doherty1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, and Type IA topoisomerases that have been implicated genetically and biochemically to collaborate with RecQ helicases to preserve chromosomal integrity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001297-Sharma1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

Clearly, RECQ1 has become the latest member of the RecQ helicase family with important biological functions through its involvement in the DNA damage response and fundamental processes of chromosomal nucleic acid metabolism.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0001297.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Supplementary Data Figure</p><p>(25.27 MB TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0001297.s001.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We acknowledge the NIA IRP Flow Cytometry Laboratory (NIH) (Dr. Robert Wersto and Christa Morris) for assistance with FACS analysis.
