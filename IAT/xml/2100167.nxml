In pancreatic beta cells, investigations have yield conflicting results concerning the possible role of detector for GLUT2 in glucose-induced insulin secretion. The group of B. Thorens demonstrated that in mice GLUT2 participates to the first phase of insulin secretion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001288-Guillam1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>.

These findings show that the expression of the GLUT2 loop did not affect GLUT4-expressing tissues and suggest that other glucose-sensing pathways are involved in these tissues. Moreover, peripheral tissues of transgenic and wild-type mice had similar insulin sensitivity, as determined by an insulin tolerance test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001288-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>).

Transgenic mice excreted massive amount of glucose in urine, which protected them against excess glucose despite attenuated pancreatic insulin production and a preference for lipid oxidation over glucose oxidation. The GLUT2 loop, used here as a molecular tool, blocked the sugar detection triggered by GLUT2 without affecting basal mRNA levels in liver, kidney and pancreas. On the other hand, the GLUT2-null mice, in which both sugar entry and sugar detection are invalidated, deteriorates after weaning, and mice die probably because they are unable to handle excess glucose by appropriate insulin secretion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001288-Guillam1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001288-Guillam2">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. The phenotype of GLUT2-loop transgenic mice may be related to the maintenance of glucose- and insulin-sensitive functions at basal levels.</p><p>The expression of the GLUT2-loop transgene interfered with GLUT2-triggered glucose detection. This highlights the efficiency of this plasma membrane chemoreceptor for glucose, and provides a new therapeutic target for glucose homeostasis. Consumption of a glucose-rich diet still led to accumulation of target gene mRNA in adipose tissue. Indeed, hyperglycemia-modulated gene expression has been reported in peripheral tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001288-Meugnier1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. In tissues without GLUT2, glucose detection occurred by GLUT2-independent mechanisms, probably due to &#x0201c;intracellular&#x0201d; metabolism. As expected, these mechanisms were not directly affected by the molecular tool (GLUT2 loop). Accordingly, GLUT2-loop transgenic mice had normal insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues, mainly muscle and adipose tissue. The capacity of peripheral tissues to respond to insulin remained unaffected by the expression of the transgene.</p><p>The amount of GLUT2 protein in the membranes of liver, pancreas and kidney cells showed that the phenotype of transgenic mice was not caused by defective glucose entry into the cells but rather by the inability of the cells to detect extracellular glucose.</p><p>A fundamental characteristic of GLUT2-loop transgenic mice was that basal metabolism remained unaffected. Nevertheless, in transgenic mice fed with the usual diet, thermic response occurred but was two times slower than in wild-type mice. Fuel oxidation indicated that transgenic mice utilize more lipids than wild-type mice. Better lipid oxidation improves resistance to high fat feeding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001288-YvanCharvet1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref> and increases weight and fat losses without major changes in lean body mass <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001288-Teegarden1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, a feature observed in these transgenic mice.</p><p>Wild-type mice use their energy stores during fasting whereas transgenic mice protect their energy stores when deprived of food due to an impaired ability to detect changes in glucose levels. The slower mobilization of glycogen stores in transgenic compared to control mice is probably due to plasma insulin, which remained high during fasting, and to the preference for lipid oxidation over glucose oxidation. Partial preservation of energy stores in transgenic mice occurred despite similar levels of circulating glucose, suggesting that low glucose concentration was inadequately detected in these mice.</p><p>Transient protection against streptozotocin-induced diabetes has been observed possibly due to many GLUT2-mediated effects, including drug access to pancreatic &#x000df; cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001288-Szkudelski1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>, but not to accelerated urinary glucose loss or larger stores of pancreatic insulin.</p><p>Therefore, we concluded that GLUT2-expressing tissues involved in glucose homeostasis poorly detected both high and low glucose levels.</p><sec id="s3a"><title>Pancreatic adaptations to impaired detection of extracellular glucose</title><p>Pancreatic glucose sensing is mediated by metabolism and primarily by glucokinase activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001288-Schuit1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.

Such perturbation appeared only after oral glucose load or the consumption of a glucose-rich diet. In GLUT2-loop transgenic mice, normal reabsorption of glucose and associated solutes occurred when blood glucose levels were under 170 mg/dl. Glucose reabsorption is not sufficient in transgenic mice and the threshold is lower than in wild-type mice, but there was no significant electrolyte loss. The renal adaptations related to GLUT2-mediated sugar detection are restricted here to decreased glucose reabsorption. We found a relationship in kidney between glucose detection by GLUT2 and the decrease in SGLT1 mRNA. Mutations in SGLT1 gene provokes glucose-galactose malabsorption accompanied by mild glucosuria whereas familial renal glucosuria is due to mutations in the SGLT2 gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001288-Wright1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. Several proteins of proximal tubule and their regulators are likely to be involved in the process of glucose tubular reabsorption. Thus, further investigation is required to understand the molecular mechanisms for this renal functional adaptation.</p><p>The mouse phenotype described here, characterized by a low level of insulin secretion and a high level of glucosuria, is reminiscent of a monogenic (HNF1&#x003b1;) form of diabetes. MODY3 patients have a defect in insulin secretion but no obvious hyperglycemia probably related to massive urinary glucose loss <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001288-Menzel1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>. The maximal renal reabsorption capacity of these patients, as in HNF1&#x003b1;-null mice, is decreased due to substantially less transcription of a sodium/glucose co-transporter (SGLT2) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001288-Pontoglio1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>. In contrast with GLUT2-loop transgenic mice, HNF1&#x003b1;-null mice had defective renal tubular reabsorption of various metabolites (amino acids, phosphates), in addition to glucose, suggesting that HNF1&#x003b1; levels are not involved in the defect we report in mice with an impaired detection of extracellular glucose.</p><p>In conclusion, artificial inhibition of GLUT2-mediated sugar sensing in a limited number of tissues, modified various parameters of glucose homeostasis. This may be advantageous because urinary glucose loss can eliminate excess glucose and reduce fat deposits. Moreover, an attenuated secretion of insulin on demand can preserve pancreatic potential in the long term.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Creation of transgenic mice</title><p>The actin promoter was used to drive strong and ubiquitous expression of the transgene.
