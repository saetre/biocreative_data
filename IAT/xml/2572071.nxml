It is considered a stem cell marker whose expression has been found to be conserved across species from fly to human [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. In the mammalian postnatal brain, Msi1 is mainly expressed in cells that are believed to be the source of adult neural stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] and seems to be critical for their maintenance and self-renewal capability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>High levels of Msi1 have been reported in tumors such as medulloblastoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], glioma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], astrocytoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], retinoblastoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and colorectal adenoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Indeed, a correlation between high levels of Msi1 expression and poor prognosis has been proposed for glioma and astrocytoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Two Msi1 direct targets have been characterized in mammals: <italic>numb </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] and <italic>CDKN1A </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Binding of Msi1 to specific motifs located in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of these mRNAs seems to interfere with translation, thereby decreasing Numb and p21<sup>WAF </sup>(also known as Cdkn1a) protein levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Numb is a regulator of three important pathways usually deregulated in cancer: Notch, Hedgehog and p53 (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]). Numb represses Notch [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and Hedgehog [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. In addition, Numb has recently been shown to prevent degradation of the tumor suppressor p53 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. The second known target of Msi1 is the cell cycle inhibitor p21<sup>WAF</sup>. Therefore, it is plausible to surmise that by repressing translation of Numb and p21<sup>WAF</sup>, high levels of Msi1 might promote aberrant cell proliferation and failure in differentiation and apoptosis.</p><p>We observed that the levels of <italic>MSI1 </italic>were elevated in Daoy neurospheres (high proliferative cultures) compared to monolayers (low proliferative cultures). This data suggested a potential role for Msi1 in promoting cancer cell proliferation in this medulloblastoma cell line. In order to test this hypothesis, we depleted Msi1 in Daoy cells by RNA interference. A significant reduction in soft agar growth (<italic>in vitro </italic>indicator of tumorigenicity) and neurosphere formation (surrogative measure of "stemness") were observed. We also identified a set of cell proliferation genes whose expression was significantly down-regulated after Msi1 shRNA-mediated knockdown. Thus our data suggested that Msi1 may promote cancer cell proliferation. We propose that Msi1 may maintain a pool of cancer cells with deregulated proliferative capabilities which may possibly serve as a source for future tumorigenic events. In this regard, Msi1 might be a positive regulator of tumor progression and a prospective target for therapeutic intervention.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell lines, plasmids and transfections</title><p>Daoy cell line was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC).

Notch, Hedgehog and Wnt pathways are central regulators of cell proliferation and their deregulation is frequently associated with medulloblastoma (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]). With the high levels of Msi1 reported for medulloblastoma, a connection among Msi1, Notch, Hedgehog and Wnt activities and tumor growth is likely.

Therefore, Hedgehog seems to be important for neurosphere formation in Daoy cells, and the increased susceptibility to cyclopamine observed for Msi1 KD cells may reflect a partial down-regulation in the activity of this pathway.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Effect of Hedgehog blockade upon neurosphere formation</bold>. The ability to form neuropheres in the presence of the Hedgehog inhibitor cyclopamine was evaluated in Daoy cells. Spheres derived from Daoy control (upper) and Msi1 knockdown (KD; lower) were incubated for one week in the presence of inhibitor (Cyc) and tomatidine (Tom; negative control) at a concentration range of 5&#x02013;20 &#x003bc;M. A reduction in neurosphere size was observed in both cell lines; however, the knockdown cell line appeared to be more sensitive to cyclopamine treatment as the effects upon sphere formation were significant (p &#x0003c; 0.05) at lower concentrations of inhibitor. a) Representative images of the effects upon neurosphere formation at 5 &#x003bc;M and 20 &#x003bc;M cyclopamine are shown.

On average, a 5-fold increase (p &#x0003c; 0.05) in &#x003b2;III Tubulin and a 8-fold decrease (p &#x0003c; 0.05) in Bcl-2 were detected when Msi1 was knocked down. The higher levels of &#x003b2;III Tubulin detected in the knockdown indicated that Msi1 arrests cell differentiation. Decline in both Bcl2 protein (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>) and <italic>BCL2 </italic>transcript (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) levels were also detected in the knockdown suggesting that Msi1 may block apoptosis in Daoy cells. As a more important reduction was detected at protein level than at mRNA level (~30% down-regulation; Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>), additional post-trancriptional mechanisms might be mediating the decrease of Bcl2 protein in our model system.

High levels of Msi1 have been found in several malignancies, including medulloblastoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. As Msi1 expression was elevated in Daoy neurospheres (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>), we asked if Msi1 may promote expansion of cancer cells. In this study, we used the cell line Daoy as our model system. Daoy is a well-characterized cell line, which among other features, expresses elevated levels of Msi1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], is able to form colonies in soft agar and neurospheres when cultured in the presence of growth factors, has functional Notch, Hedgehog and Wnt signaling pathways and is tumorigenic in <italic>nude </italic>mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. We performed a shRNA mediated knockdown of Msi1 in Daoy and found that cancer cells expressing low levels of Msi1 were less clonogenic (proliferation assay), more differentiated (higher &#x003b2;III Tubulin expression) and, possibly, more apoptotic (lower Bcl2 expression). We also observed a defect in neurosphere formation which was consistent with a potential role of Msi1 in activating proliferation and/or preventing differentiation and apoptosis in Daoy cells. Taken together, our data suggest that Msi1 may contribute to the proliferation of cancer cells. This observation was in agreement with previous reports correlating high levels of Msi1 with glioma and astrocytoma malignancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>Notch, Hedgehog, Wnt and p53 are important pathways that are frequently found to be deregulated in cancer (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]). Msi1 represses translation of <italic>numb </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]; an antagonist of Notch and Hedgehog signaling pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] which also prevents degradation of the tumor suppressor p53 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Msi1 also activates Wnt pathway through an autocrine mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Thus it is possible that high levels of Msi1 may deregulate Notch, Hedgehog, Wnt and p53 activities in cancer cells thereby contributing to tumor growth.</p><p>We performed gene expression analysis to determine the downstream effects derived from Msi1 depletion. Since Daoy is p53 defective, the effects detected in cell proliferation in our model system are therefore independent of p53. However, given that p53 inactivation is found in 50% of the malignancies (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]), an in-depth work to elucidate the possible effects of Msi1 upon p53 activity in cancer cells is highly desirable.</p><p>We demonstrated that Msi1 regulates the expression of several genes involved in cell proliferation and tumorigenicity such us <italic>MYCN</italic>, <italic>SMO</italic>, <italic>NOTCH2</italic>, <italic>CCND1</italic>, <italic>CCND2</italic>, <italic>CDKN1A</italic>, <italic>FOS</italic>, <italic>GLI1</italic>, and <italic>DKK1 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Noteworthy was the differential expression of two cell cycle regulators: <italic>CDKN1A </italic>(encoding p21<sup>WAF</sup>) and <italic>CCND1 </italic>(encoding Cyclin D1). A 2-fold decrease was found in <italic>CDKN1A </italic>levels when Msi1 was depleted in Daoy, possibly due to a reduced Hedgehog activity. Battelli <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] reported that over-expression of Msi1 in HEK293 activates cell proliferation by down-regulating p21<sup>WAF </sup>protein levels. Using a knockdown model in Daoy, we showed that Msi1 increases p21<sup>WAF </sup>transcription, possibly, <italic>via </italic>Hedgehog activation. Although found in different model systems, it seems that Msi1 may play a dual role in regulating p21<sup>WAF</sup>; positive and indirect at the level of transcription (as shown here) and negative and direct at the post-transcriptional level (as previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]).</p><p>The up-regulation of <italic>CCND1 </italic>detected in the Msi1 knockdown was intriguing. <italic>CCND1 </italic>transcription is induced in response to many oncogenic signals like Ras, ErB2, Src and Wnt (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]) and CyclinD1 overexpression is associated with tumorigenesis and metastasis. Moreover, <italic>CCND1 </italic>expression is considered an early event in malignancy and its loss inhibits tumor formation in a <italic>Ptch1</italic><sup>+/- </sup>mouse model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. On the other hand and in agreement with our observation, down-regulation of <italic>CCND1 </italic>has recently been reported by Rubio et al. during spontaneous mesenchymal cell transformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Therefore, the mechanism driving up-regulation of <italic>CCND1 </italic>and its biological implications in our knockdown model system would justify a more intense investigation.</p><p>Cross-talk within Notch, Hedgehog and Wnt pathways has often been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>] indicating that the activity of these pathways needs to be fine-tuned in order to maintain homeostasis. We observed that Msi1 regulated the expression of Hedgehog key components, including the pathway mediators <italic>SMO </italic>and <italic>GLI1 </italic>and the pathway downstream target <italic>MYCN</italic>, known to control cell proliferation and tumorigenicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Interestingly, simultaneous expression of <italic>MSI1 </italic>and <italic>MYCN </italic>occurs in clinical specimens <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://home.ccr.cancer.gov/oncology/oncogenomics/"/>, which posits <italic>MYCN </italic>as an attractive Msi1 downstream effector. Moreover, <italic>MYCN </italic>represses transcription of the tumor suppressor <italic>DKK1 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. We thus propose that down-regulation of <italic>MYCN </italic>in Daoy cancer cells after Msi1 depletion might induce expression of the Wnt repressor <italic>DKK1</italic>, therefore interconnecting Msi1, Wnt and Hedgehog signaling pathways. At least in part, this Msi1/MycN/Dkk-1 axis may explain the growth suppressive effect observed in our knockdown model system.</p><p>To determine the relevance of the Hedgehog pathway in Daoy cancer cells, we performed a neurosphere culture assay in the presence of cyclopamine. Cyclopamine inhibited neurosphere formation in both cases; however, the effects in the knockdown cells were evident at a significantly lower concentration of antagonist. This data was consistent with a partial down-regulation of Hedgehog activity after Msi1 depletion in Daoy cells. On the other hand, it does not exclude the possibility that Msi1 may also modulate the activity of additional cell proliferation pathways such as Notch or Wnt.</p><p>We also found that Msi1 increased <italic>NOTCH2 </italic>levels thus suggesting a potential role of Msi1 in contributing to tumor growth. <italic>NOTCH2 </italic>is a component of the Notch pathway that acts as a mitogen for cerebellar granule cell precursors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>] and whose expression has been associated with malignancy in brain tumors and with the persistence of cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. Indeed, it has been shown that Notch blockade reduces cancer cells in Daoy and inhibits tumor engraftment in nude mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, our data suggest that Msi1 modulates proliferation of cancer cells. Msi1 regulated expression of a set of genes with a well-established role in cell proliferation, cell differentiation and survival and its loss appeared to have a detrimental effect on the maintenance of cancer cells. We thus propose that, by hijacking normal cell signaling pathways, Msi1 may sustain cancer cells. Likely, Msi1 regulates additional genes and a systems biology approach needs to be carried out to identify new Msi1 direct targets (i.e. post-transcriptionally regulated genes) and uncover the gene network controlled by Msi1. We believe that the identification of additional Msi1 direct target genes is necessary to better understand the function of this RNA binding protein in cancer cells. These insights may provide a foundation for designing novel and more rational therapies.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>PCSD performed all the experiments, interpreted the results, contributed with scientific discussion and prepared the manuscript.
