Ultra-low-dose naloxone (NLX) prevents this switch and attenuates opioid tolerance and dependence. This protective effect is mediated via a high-affinity interaction of NLX to a pentapeptide region in c-terminal filamin A (FLNA), a scaffolding protein interacting with MOR. In organotypic striatal slice cultures, we now show that acute morphine induces a dose-dependent Go-to-Gs coupling switch at 5 and 15 min that resolves by 1 hr. The acute Gs coupling induced by 100 &#x000b5;M morphine was completely prevented by co-treatment with 100 pM NLX, (&#x0002b;)NLX, or naltrexone (NTX), or their pentapeptide binding site (FLNA<sub>2561&#x02013;2565</sub>), which we show can act as a decoy for MOR or bind to FLNA itself. All of these co-treatments presumably prevent the MOR&#x02013;FLNA interaction. Since ultra-low-dose NTX also attenuates the addictive properties of opioids, we assessed striatal cAMP production and CREB phosphorylation at S<sup>133</sup>. Correlating with the Gs coupling, acute morphine induced elevated cAMP levels and a several-fold increase in pS<sup>133</sup>CREB that were also completely blocked by NLX, NTX or the FLNA pentapeptide. We propose that acute, robust stimulation of MOR causes an interaction with FLNA that allows an initially transient MOR&#x02013;Gs coupling, which recovers with receptor recycling but persists when MOR stimulation is repeated or prolonged. The complete prevention of this acute, morphine-induced MOR&#x02013;Gs coupling by 100 pM NLX/NTX or 10 &#x000b5;M pentapeptide segment of FLNA further elucidates both MOR signaling and the mechanism of action of ultra-low-dose NLX or NTX in attenuating opioid tolerance, dependence and addictive potential.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Ultra-low-dose opioid antagonists have been shown to enhance opioid analgesia, minimize opioid tolerance and dependence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004282-Crain1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004282-Powell1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref> and attenuate the addictive properties of opioids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004282-Olmstead1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004282-Leri1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>.

Also implicating FLNA in desensitization, our recent organotypic striatal slice culture data showed that potentially disrupting the MOR&#x02013;FLNA interaction via NLX's high-affinity binding to FLNA blocks the chronic morphine-induced G protein coupling switch by MOR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004282-Wang3">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Specifically, FLNA peptide fragments containing the NLX binding site blocked the protective effect of NLX on both the MOR&#x02013;Gs coupling and downstream cAMP accumulation induced by chronic morphine (twice daily 1-hr exposures for 7 days), presumably by interfering with NLX's binding to FLNA in the tissues.</p><p>Again using organotypic striatal slice cultures, we show here that acute morphine causes a dose-dependent and transient MOR&#x02013;Gs coupling that resolves by 1 hr. This is the first indication that MOR&#x02013;Gs coupling occurs acutely and dynamically and is not only a consequence of chronic opioid treatment. To assess the involvement of FLNA in this acute opioid-induced Gs coupling, we co-treated slices with NLX, naltrexone (NTX), or FLNA<sub>2561&#x02013;2565</sub>, their pentapeptide binding site, as a decoy for MOR. We also examined the effects of these treatments on cAMP production and downstream phosphorylation of the cAMP-response-element-binding protein (CREB) at S<sup>133</sup> as a marker of addictive processes, since ultra-low-dose NTX attenuates the acute rewarding effects of opioids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004282-Olmstead1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004282-Leri1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. CREB is activated by phosphorylation at S<sup>133</sup> predominantly by protein kinase A (PKA) through binding of cAMP. Hence, increasing levels of cAMP from activation of adenylyl cyclase following MOR&#x02013;Gs coupling could contribute to the acute rewarding or addictive properties of opiates. A partial mediation of the acute rewarding effects of opiates by Gs signaling could explain the apparent discrepancy that ultra-low-dose NLX or NTX can enhance opioid analgesia while also attenuating the addictive properties of opioids.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Animals</title><p>Male Sprague Dawley rats (200 to 250 g) purchased from Taconic (Germantown, NY) were housed two per cage and maintained on a regular 12-hr light/dark cycle in a climate-controlled room with food and water available <italic>ad libitum.</italic> For organotypic brain slice cultures, rats were sacrificed by rapid decapitation and striata were removed on ice and treated <italic>in vitro</italic> as described below.

While some level of Gs coupling has been previously detected in opioid-na&#x000ef;ve or acute morphine exposed CHO cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004282-Chakrabarti1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, the present work in organotypic striatal slice cultures is the first to demonstrate that acute exposure to a high concentration of morphine causes predominant but transient MOR&#x02013;Gs coupling similar to the persistent change following chronic morphine. This transient and dose-dependent G protein coupling switch of MORs, evident at 5 and 15 minutes of morphine exposure, is unlikely to represent an acute tolerance/dependence effect since MOR had completely reverted to its native Go coupling by 1 hour of morphine exposure. Instead we propose that with even this brief period of continued stimulation following high-dose morphine, MOR initially couples to Gs instead of Gi/o but is able to recover. With the repeated or prolonged MOR stimulation of chronic opiate exposure, however, this dynamic cycling from Gs back to Go evidently becomes impaired, leading to a persistent Gs coupling, behaviorally manifest as opioid analgesic tolerance and dependence.</p><p>Similar to ultra-low-dose NLX's suppression of the chronic morphine-induced coupling switch, the present data show that this acute morphine-induced coupling switch by MOR can be completely prevented by co-treatment with 100 pM NLX or NTX or 10 &#x000b5;M concentration of their pentapeptide binding site on FLNA. In addition, the equal efficacy in blocking this Gs coupling of 100 pM (&#x0002b;)NLX, the isomer that is inactive as an opioid antagonist, further confirms a mechanism of action other than antagonism of MOR. We previously discerned the precise binding site of NLX as FLNA<sub>2561-2565</sub> using overlapping peptides and then blocked the protective effects of NLX on MOR&#x02013;Gs coupling and cAMP accumulation in organotypic striatal slice cultures by co-incubation with decapeptides containing this binding site <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004282-Wang3">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. In this prior study, FLNA peptides presumably bound to NLX, blocking its prevention of the morphine-induced MOR&#x02013;Gs coupling by preventing it from binding full-length FLNA in the tissues. These data led us to postulate that the interaction between MOR and FLNA, first demonstrated by Onoprishvili et al. (2003), was critical to the G protein coupling switch. We theorized that a particular FLNA&#x02013;MOR interaction enables MOR to release from the signaling complex to couple to Gs upon subsequent receptor stimulation. In addition to FLNA, MOR has recently been shown to interact with another scaffolding protein, spinophilin (Charlton et al., 2008). While blocking the MOR&#x02013;FLNA association, at least via ultra-low-dose NLX/NTX, diminishes tolerance, dependence and the rewarding effects of opiates, preserving or enhancing MOR's association with spinophilin appears to similarly modify these opioid effects.</p><p>In the present study, we showed the pentapeptide FLNA<sub>2561&#x02013;2565</sub> itself may act as a decoy for MOR to prevent the MOR&#x02013;FLNA interaction and subsequent Gs coupling by MOR. This VAKGL pentapeptide was as effective as NLX or NTX as all three completely blocked the transient switch to Gs coupling by MOR during acute, high-dose morphine exposure. NLX and NTX presumably prevent the MOR&#x02013;FLNA interaction by binding to their VAKGL binding site on FLNA, and this binding site on FLNA does appear be the approximate site on this protein that interacts with MOR. The demonstration that both purified MOR and FLNA proteins bind to VAKGL suggests that the VAKGL pentapeptide can similarly prevent the MOR&#x02013;FLNA interaction but by binding to either protein. It is also possible that NLX and NTX block MOR&#x02013;Gs coupling by changing the conformation of FLNA upon binding rather than by direct interference, and that by binding to &#x0201c;itself&#x0201d; in the full-length protein, VAKGL similarly prevents the changed FLNA conformation. Finally, since the VAKGL peptide can both prevent NLX's protective effects as in our prior study (Wang et al., 2008) as well as mimic NLX's protective effects when used alone in the current study, we theorize that this pentapeptide preferentially binds NLX but in its absence will interact with MOR or full-length FLNA. Further study is needed to elucidate the precise VAKGL interaction site on FLNA and MOR.</p><p>Our finding that all three co-treatments, NLX, NTX or the decoy pentapeptide also prevented morphine-induced CREB activation (as indicated by ser<sup>133</sup> phosphorylation) in these striatal slice cultures may offer a mechanistic explanation for the attenuation of opioid reward and addictive processes by ultra-low-dose NTX. Found in all cells of the brain, CREB is a transcription factor implicated in addiction as well as learning and memory and several other experience-dependent, adaptive (or maladaptive) behaviors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004282-Carlezon1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. In general, CREB is inhibited by acute opioid treatment, an effect that is completely attenuated by chronic opioid treatment, and activated during opioid withdrawal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004282-Guitart1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>. However, a regional mapping study showed that opioid withdrawal activates CREB in locus coeruleus, nucleus accumbens and amygdala but inhibits CREB in lateral ventral tegemental area and dorsal raphe nucleus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004282-ShawLutchman1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. In the striatum, CREB activation has been viewed as a homeostatic adaptation, attenuating the acute rewarding effects of drugs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004282-Nestler1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004282-Nestler2">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. This view is supported by nucleus accumbens overexpression of CREB or a dominant-negative CREB mutant respectively reducing or increasing the rewarding effects of opioids in the conditioned place preference test <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004282-Barot1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>.

Clearly, CREB activation is implicated in addiction, but whether it directly contributes to the acute rewarding effects of drugs or initiates a homeostatic regulation thereof appears less clear.</p><p>Again, it is possible that the several-fold increase in pS<sup>133</sup>CREB observed here following acute, high-dose morphine might indicate acute dependence rather than acute rewarding effects; however, the transient nature of the MOR&#x02013;Gs coupling and the return to inhibition of cAMP at 1 hr suggests otherwise. The correlation of pS<sup>133</sup>CREB with the MOR&#x02013;Gs coupling and cAMP production following acute high-dose morphine exposure, as well as the similar treatment effects on all, suggest that this alternative signaling mode of MOR may contribute to the acute rewarding or addictive effects of opioids. This counterintuitive notion may explain the apparent paradox that ultra-low-dose NTX, while enhancing the analgesic effects of opioids, decreases the acute rewarding or addictive properties of morphine or oxycodone as measured in conditioned place preference or self-administration and reinstatement paradigms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004282-Olmstead1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004282-Leri1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. If one considers analgesic tolerance, opioid dependence, and opioid addiction together as adaptive regulations to continued opioid exposure, a treatment that prevents MOR's signaling adaptation of switching its G protein partner may logically attenuate these seemingly divergent behavioral consequences of chronic opioid exposure. However, the acute rewarding effects of opioids are not completely blocked by ultra-low-dose opioid antagonists, suggesting that a MOR&#x02013;Gs coupling may only partially contribute to the addictive or rewarding effects. Although ultra-low-dose NTX blocks the conditioned place preference to oxycodone or morphine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004282-Olmstead1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, its co-self-administration only reduces the rewarding potency of these opioids but does not abolish self-administration outright <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004282-Leri1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. Nevertheless, it is tempting to theorize that a direct stimulatory effect on VTA neurons, as opposed to the proposed disinhibition via inhibition of GABA interneurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004282-Spanagel1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, may play some role in opioid reward. Finally, a MOR&#x02013;Gs coupling mediation of reward, increasing with increasing drug exposure, is in keeping with current theories that the escalation of drug use signifying drug dependence may not indicate a &#x0201c;tolerance&#x0201d; to rewarding effects but instead a sensitization to rewarding effects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004282-Zernig1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In summary, the present work has demonstrated that acute, high-dose morphine causes an immediate but transient switch in G protein coupling by MOR from Go to Gs similar to the persistent switch caused by chronic morphine. Ultra-low doses of NLX, NTX or even (&#x0002b;)NLX prevent this switch, just as ultra-low-dose NLX has previously been shown to attenuate the chronic morphine-induced coupling switch by MOR. The transient nature of this acute altered coupling suggests that in recycling, the receptor eventually recovers and couples to its native G protein. We hypothesize that with chronic opioid exposure, the receptor loses the ability to recover and continues to couple to Gs, activating the adenylyl cyclase/cAMP pathway, upregulating protein kinase A, and phosphorylating CREB as one downstream effector example. The persistently elevated phosphorylated CREB may then shape the expression of responsive genes including those closely related to drug addiction or withdrawal, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004282-Akbarian1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, and tolerance. Importantly, the equivalent blockade of Gs coupling and pS<sup>133</sup>CREB by the NLX and NTX pentapeptide binding site on FLNA further elucidates the mechanism of action of ultra-low-dose NLX and NTX in their varied effects. These data strengthen our hypothesis that a particular MOR&#x02013;FLNA interaction allows MOR to couple to Gs and that disrupting this interaction, either by NLX/NTX binding to FLNA or via a FLNA peptide binding to MOR and/or FLNA, can prevent the altered coupling and attenuate tolerance, dependence and addictive properties associated with opioid drugs.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0004282-Crain1"><label>1</label><citation citation-type="journal"><person-group
