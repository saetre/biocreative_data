We have recently reported activation of the Wnt signaling pathway by accumulation of &#x003b2;-catenin in all analyzed parathyroid tumors from patients with primary HPT (pHPT) and in hyperplastic parathyroid glands from patients with uremia secondary to HPT (sHPT). Mechanisms that may account for this activation have not been identified, except for a few cases of &#x003b2;-catenin (<italic>CTNNB1</italic>) stabilizing mutation in pHPT tumors.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Methods and Findings</title><p>Reverse transcription PCR and Western blot analysis showed expression of an aberrantly spliced internally truncated WNT coreceptor low-density lipoprotein receptor&#x02013;related protein 5 (LRP5) in 32 out of 37 pHPT tumors (86&#x00025;) and 20 out of 20 sHPT tumors (100&#x00025;). Stabilizing mutation of <italic>CTNNB1</italic> and expression of the internally truncated LRP5 receptor was mutually exclusive. Expression of the truncated LRP5 receptor was required to maintain the nonphosphorylated active &#x003b2;-catenin level, transcription activity of &#x003b2;-catenin, <italic>MYC</italic> expression, parathyroid cell growth in vitro, and parathyroid tumor growth in a xenograft severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mouse model. WNT3 ligand and the internally truncated LRP5 receptor strongly activated transcription, and the internally truncated LRP5 receptor was insensitive to inhibition by DKK1.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The internally truncated LRP5 receptor is strongly implicated in deregulated activation of the WNT/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling pathway in hyperparathyroid tumors, and presents a potential target for therapeutic intervention.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>Gunnar Westin and colleagues report the expression of an aberrantly spliced LRP5 receptor in primary and spontaneous parathyroid tumors and implicate it in the deregulated activation of the Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling pathway.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="editor"><sec id="sb1"><title>Editors' Summary</title><sec id="sb1a"><title>Background.</title><p>The parathyroid glands&#x02014;four rice-sized glands in the neck&#x02014;maintain a normal calcium balance in the body, to maintain strong bones and essential cellular functions. The glands release parathyroid hormone as a response to a decrease in blood calcium level. By stimulating calcium release from bone and its absorption in the gut, parathyroid hormone restores the blood calcium level. However, 100,000 new individuals in the US develop hyperparathyroidism (HPT) annually, characterized by enlarged, overactive parathyroid glands and high blood levels of calcium. Primary HPT (pHPT) is usually caused by a benign tumor (a non-life-threatening growth) in one of the parathyroid glands. Secondary HPT (sHPT) occurs in response to calcium regulatory disturbances, linked to vitamin D deficiency, and more or less invariably develops in patients with uremic kidney disease.</p></sec><sec id="sb1b"><title>Why Was This Study Done?</title><p>HPT is usually treated by surgical removal of the enlarged parathyroid glands, which is done with great efficiency. However, ideally, doctors would like to know what drives the overgrowth of the parathyroid glands to be able to develop drugs for treatment or disease prophylaxis. Researchers recently reported that the cells in enlarged parathyroid glands from patients with HPT contain high amounts of &#x003b2;-catenin. This protein is part of the Wnt signaling pathway, which has been found to be disrupted in many tumor entities in other organs. In the absence of Wnt proteins, a group of proteins called the &#x003b2;-catenin destruction complex marks &#x003b2;-catenin so that it is rapidly destroyed. When Wnt proteins bind to a cell-surface receptor called Frizzled and a coreceptor called LRP5, the destruction complex is inhibited and &#x003b2;-catenin accumulates. This accumulation induces the production of other proteins (in particular, c-Myc) that stimulate cell growth and division. The accumulation of &#x003b2;-catenin in the enlarged parathyroid glands of patients with HPT could, therefore, significantly contribute to the overgrowth of their glands&#x02014;but what causes &#x003b2;-catenin accumulation? In this study, the researchers have investigated this question to try to identify a target for drugs to treat HPT.</p></sec><sec id="sb1c"><title>What Did the Researchers Do and Find?</title><p>The researchers looked for genetic changes (mutations) in &#x003b2;-catenin that stabilize the protein and measured the expression of LRP5 in abnormal parathyroid gland tissue from 37 patients with pHPT and 20 with uremia and sHPT. All the samples contained high levels of &#x003b2;-catenin, but only four contained a &#x003b2;-catenin&#x02013;stabilizing mutation. All the sHPT samples and 32 pHPT samples (but none of the samples containing the &#x003b2;-catenin stabilizing mutation) expressed a mutated LRP5, with the central region deleted. To investigate the functional consequences of this internally deleted LRP5 protein, the researchers used a technique called RNA interference to block its expression in a human parathyroid tumor cell line. They found that expression of the mutated, short LRP5 is required for accumulation of &#x003b2;-catenin, expression of c-Myc, and continued growth of the cell line in test tubes and in animals.</p></sec><sec id="sb1d"><title>What Do These Findings Mean?</title><p>The accumulation of &#x003b2;-catenin in all the enlarged parathyroid glands examined so far strongly implicates abnormal Wnt/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling in the development of pHPT and sHPT. These new findings identify which part of the signaling pathway is altered. The expression data and functional data together suggest that an internally deleted LRP5 coreceptor is often responsible for the accumulation of &#x003b2;-catenin. The functional data also show that expression of shortened LRP5 is necessary for the abnormal growth of parathyroid tumor cells. Exactly how the internally deleted coreceptor activates &#x003b2;-catenin signaling in parathyroid gland cells, or why a shorter-than-normal LRP5 is made, are not yet known. However, because these findings indicate that internally deleted LRP5 has a fundamental role in activating Wnt signaling in HPT, drugs that inactivate this aberrant protein but leave the normal protein unscathed might provide a nonsurgical treatment for this common hormone disorder.</p></sec><sec id="sb1e"><title>Additional Information.</title><p>Please access these Web sites via the online version of this summary at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0040328">http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0040328</ext-link>.</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>edlinePlus has encyclopedia pages on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001215.htm">hyperparathyroidism</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000384.htm">primary hyperparathyroidism</ext-link>, and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000318.htm">secondary hyperparathyroidim</ext-link> (in English and Spanish)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Information is available for patients from the US National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.endocrine.niddk.nih.gov/pubs/hyper/hyper.htm">hyperparathyroidism</ext-link>, which includes links to organizations that help people with hyperparathyroidism</p></list-item><list-item><p>Wikipedia maintains pages on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wnt_signaling_pathway">Wnt signaling pathway</ext-link> and on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta-catenin">&#x003b2;-catenin</ext-link> (note that Wikipedia is a free online encyclopedia that anyone can edit; available in several languages)</p></list-item></list></sec></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Bj&#x000f6;rklund P, &#x000c5;kerstr&#x000f6;m G, Westin G (2007) An LRP5 receptor with internal deletion in hyperparathyroid tumors with implications for deregulated WNT/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling.

In agreement with these results, WNT3-induced TOPFLASH transcription was inhibited by DKK1 in HEK293T cells cotransfected with LRP5wt and not with LRP5&#x00394;666&#x02013;809 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0040328-g005">Figure 5</xref>D). Also, the activity of LRP5&#x00394;666&#x02013;809 in unstimulated cells (7-fold) was insensible to DKK1. In contrast to sHPT-1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0040328-g005">Figure 5</xref>A), HEK293T cells responded to WNT1-conditioned medium (7-fold) and was sensitive to DKK1 inhibition as expected. However, the small increase of LRP5&#x00394;666&#x02013;809 activity in the presence of WNT1 (1.7-fold) was insensible to DKK1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pmed-0040328-g005">Figure 5</xref>D). The impaired DKK1-mediated antagonism of &#x003b2;-catenin activity may contribute to overall signaling of the internally truncated LRP5 receptor.</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>Inhibition of Tumor Growth in SCID Mice</title><p>The in vivo growth properties of sHPT-1 cells were evaluated in a xenograft SCID mouse model.

We reported <italic>CTNNB1</italic>-stabilizing mutations in a few cases (3 out of 20) of pHPT tumors, while no mutation was found in uremic secondary HPT tumors, and inactivating truncations of APC were not seen &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040328-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d;. Recently, parathyroid adenomas from 97 patients with pHPT who had undergone parathyroidectomy in the United States were analyzed regarding <italic>CTNNB1</italic>-stabilizing mutations in exon 3 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040328-b033">33</xref>&#x0005d;. In agreement with one previous smaller study of Japanese patients &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040328-b034">34</xref>&#x0005d;, no mutations were identified. Taken together, these results indicated a low <italic>CTNNB1</italic> mutation frequency in pHPT tumors &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040328-b035">35</xref>&#x0005d;. We are currently analyzing a large number of additional pHPT tumors from Swedish patients. A few additional tumors with <italic>CTNNB1</italic>-stabilizing mutations has been found so far, suggesting an overall mutation frequency of approximately 6&#x00025; (Bj&#x000f6;rklund et al., unpublished data). This frequency is slightly lower than that observed for colorectal cancers, in which approximately 10&#x00025; of the tumors harbored missense mutations or interstitial deletions of exon 3 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040328-b013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040328-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Several lines of experimental evidence presented here support a fundamental role of the internally truncated LRP5 receptor in regulating &#x003b2;-catenin&#x02013;driven transcription in parathyroid tumor cells. The truncated LRP5 receptor was frequently expressed both in parathyroid tumors of primary origin (86&#x00025;) and in hyperplastic parathyroid glands of HPT secondary to uremia (100&#x00025;). Of all 57 analyzed parathyroid tumors with accumulated &#x003b2;-catenin, 52 expressed the internally truncated LRP5 receptor without <italic>CTNNB1</italic>-stabilizing mutations, four tumors had <italic>CTNNB1</italic>-stabilizing mutations but no truncated LRP5 receptor, and 1 tumor displayed neither aberration. Thus, it seems that mutation of <italic>CTNNB1</italic> and expression of LRP5&#x00394;666&#x02013;809 is mutually exclusive.</p><p>All reported <italic>LRP5</italic> missense mutations, which cause a high-bone-mass phenotype, are located before the first epidermal growth factor&#x02013;like repeat in the amino terminal part of the receptor, not including the third YWTD &#x003b2;-propeller domain, which is absent in the truncated LRP5 receptor. Several mutations of <italic>LRP5</italic> known to cause osteoporosis-pseudoglioma syndrome is located within amino acids 666&#x02013;809, highlighting a functional role for this part of the protein &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040328-b036">36</xref>&#x0005d;. Osteoporosis-pseudoglioma mutations seem to cause varying degree of reduced Wnt or Norrin signaling by unknown mechanisms, as determined by the TOPFLASH reporter assay &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040328-b037">37</xref>&#x0005d;. Clearly, the deletion of 142 amino acids in LRP5&#x00394;666&#x02013;809 and a missense mutation in the same part of the receptor have opposite effects. A missense mutation may for example interfere with binding of cell-type&#x02013;specific factor(s), while a larger deletion may result in structural changes of the receptor with a different impact on cofactor interactions and signal outcome. The mechanism(s) by which the internally truncated LRP5 receptor activates &#x003b2;-catenin signaling in tumor cells remains to be elucidated, but may involve impaired inhibition by DKK1. The WNT3 ligand activated transient transcription more strongly in the presence of LRP5&#x00394;666&#x02013;809 than LRP5wt, possibly suggesting favored interaction of WNT3 with the internally truncated receptor. We emphasize that the conditioned medium of WNT1, WNT3, WNT3A, and DKK1 used throughout this study might contain uncharacterized signaling molecules induced by the WNTs or DKK1.</p><p>RNA splicing defects in cancer are common, but seem rarely to be caused by somatic mutations in splice sites and regulatory elements. Alternative splicing may potentially present as a diagnostic marker &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040328-b038">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040328-b039">39</xref>&#x0005d;. Interestingly, aberrant splicing between direct repeat sequences with potential cryptic splice sites and without mutations in selected parts of the gene has been described also for the <italic>MDM2</italic> oncogene in breast cancer &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040328-b040">40</xref>&#x0005d;. We found no mutations or polymorphisms in the sequenced exons/branch points/intron&#x02013;exon junctions of the <italic>LRP5</italic> gene in the analyzed tumors that potentially could explain the aberrant splicing. Mutations in other areas of the <italic>LRP5</italic> gene affecting splicing specificity, accuracy, or efficiency, or perhaps more likely interference of <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors of the splicing machinery, are other possibilities. Alternative splicing may be affected in a splicing factor concentration-dependent manner &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pmed-0040328-b041">41</xref>&#x0005d;, and this may also apply to aberrant splicing in tumors. Identification of splicing oncogenes or splicing tumor suppressor genes is being pursued.</p><p>The results support a fundamental role of the aberrantly spliced internally truncated LRP5 receptor in activating WNT/&#x003b2;-catenin signaling in parathyroid tumor cells. LRP5 receptors could be attractive targets for the development of antitumor drugs that specifically inactivate the truncated receptor and leave the normal protein unaffected.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are grateful to B.
