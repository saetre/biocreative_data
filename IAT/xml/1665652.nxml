We previously identified the DNA damage&#x02013;signaling protein ATR as the cellular factor that mediates Vpr-induced G<sub>2</sub> arrest and apoptosis. Here, we examine the mechanism of induction of apoptosis by Vpr and how it relates to induction of G<sub>2</sub> arrest. We find that entry into G<sub>2</sub> is a requirement for Vpr to induce apoptosis. We investigated the role of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore by knockdown of its essential component, the adenine nucleotide translocator. We found that Vpr-induced apoptosis was unaffected by knockdown of ANT. Instead, apoptosis is triggered through a different mitochondrial pore protein, Bax. In support of the idea that checkpoint activation and apoptosis induction are functionally linked, we show that Bax activation by Vpr was ablated when ATR or GADD45&#x003b1; was knocked down. Certain mutants of Vpr, such as R77Q and I74A, identified in long-term nonprogressors, have been proposed to inefficiently induce apoptosis while activating the G<sub>2</sub> checkpoint in a normal manner. We tested the in vitro phenotypes of these mutants and found that their abilities to induce apoptosis and G<sub>2</sub> arrest are indistinguishable from those of HIV-1<sub>NL4&#x02013;3</sub><italic>vpr</italic>, providing additional support to the idea that G<sub>2</sub> arrest and apoptosis induction are mechanistically linked.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="synopsis"><title>Synopsis</title><p>HIV-1 encodes a small gene known as <italic>vpr</italic> (viral protein regulatory) whose product is a 96&#x02013;amino acid protein. HIV-1 infects cells of the immune system, such as CD4-positive lymphocytes. When cells become infected with HIV-1, two deleterious effects result from expression of the <italic>vpr</italic> gene. One effect of <italic>vpr</italic> is to manipulate the cell cycle by blocking the cells in G<sub>2</sub> (the phase of the cell cycle immediately preceding mitosis). Thus, cells infected with HIV-1 cease to proliferate, due to the action of <italic>vpr</italic>. A second effect of <italic>vpr</italic> is the induction of cell death by a process known as apoptosis or programmed cell death. When cells die by apoptosis, they do so following activation of a cellular set of genes and proteins whose primary function is to inactivate various cellular functions that are needed in order to maintain cellular viability. In this study, Andersen et al. demonstrate that the above two effects of <italic>vpr</italic> are linked. In particular, the authors show that the blockade in cell proliferation in G<sub>2</sub> is a requirement toward the onset of programmed cell death. Programmed cell death can be accomplished by a number of cellular proteins known as &#x0201c;executioners.&#x0201d; Various executioner proteins reside on the mitochondrial membranes and may trigger release of factors from the mitochondria, which in turn will precipitate the onset of apoptosis.

We, and others, have previously shown that Vpr causes activation of the G<sub>2</sub> checkpoint protein, ATR (ataxia and telangiectasia mutated and Rad3 related), a serine/threonine kinase responsive to DNA damage and replication stress &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020127-b012">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020127-b014">14</xref>&#x0005d;. Furthermore, activation of ATR by Vpr is required for Vpr-induced G<sub>2</sub> arrest and involves the ATR-associated molecules Rad17 and the Rad9-Rad1-Hus1 trimer &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020127-b014">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020127-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>A cause&#x02013;effect relationship between the two deleterious actions of Vpr (G<sub>2</sub> arrest and apoptosis) has not been established. Indirect evidence supports the notion that induction of G<sub>2</sub> arrest and apoptosis are linked. For example, treatment of cells with either caffeine, an inhibitor of ATR/ATM checkpoint function, or small interfering RNA (siRNA) specific to ATR, relieves both Vpr-induced G<sub>2</sub> arrest and apoptosis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020127-b017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020127-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;.

Taken together, these data suggest a model in which checkpoint activation and apoptosis signaling by Vpr are functionally associated and that such an association stems from the ability of Vpr to activate ATR &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020127-b012">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020127-b014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020127-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>On the other hand, evidence from mutagenesis studies suggests that checkpoint activation and apoptosis may be separable effects of Vpr. Thus, mutants of Vpr have been described that induce normal levels of G<sub>2</sub> arrest but are partially impaired for induction of apoptosis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020127-b021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020127-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;. One model to explain the proapoptotic activity of Vpr was proposed by Jacotot et al. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020127-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d; and Vieira et al. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020127-b024">24</xref>&#x0005d;, who observed that recombinant Vpr associates with the adenine nucleotide transporter (ANT) on purified mitochondria, to directly promote release of mitochondrion-associated cytochrome <italic>c</italic> and apoptosis. This finding suggested that Vpr initiated the commitment to apoptosis at the mitochondrial membrane by binding to ANT, rather than by activating upstream stress signaling pathways derived from checkpoint activation.</p><p>In the present study, we examine the relationship between induction of G<sub>2</sub> arrest and onset of apoptosis by Vpr. We find that entry into G<sub>2</sub> is a requirement for Vpr to induce apoptosis. Since the requirement for entry into G<sub>2</sub> seemed inconsistent with the reported ability of Vpr to bind to ANT and promote apoptosis in a cell cycle&#x02013;independent manner, we then examined the requirement for ANT. We find that Vpr-induced apoptosis is unaffected by knockdown of ANT. Instead, Vpr-induced apoptosis is dependent on the presence of Bax and is concomitant with Bax activation. Furthermore, Bax activation is a result of proapoptotic signals transduced by Vpr through the upstream stress proteins ATR and GADD45&#x003b1; (growth arrest and DNA damage&#x02013;responsive protein &#x003b1;) because knockdown of ATR or GADD45&#x003b1; prevented activation of Bax. We also demonstrate that, despite the striking similarities between the signaling events induced by Vpr and those induced by genotoxic stress, important differences can be found. Specifically, Vpr-induced apoptosis is abrogated by checkpoint inhibition, while apoptosis induced by genotoxic agents is exacerbated by checkpoint inhibition. Taken together, these results demonstrate that Vpr activates the ATR-initiated DNA damage&#x02013;signaling pathway to link checkpoint activation and commitment to apoptosis.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>G<sub>2</sub> Arrest Precedes the Release of Mitochondrial Smac and Caspase Activation</title><p>Treatment with caffeine, an inhibitor of ATR and ATM, or siRNA targeted to ATR, abrogates Vpr-induced G<sub>2</sub> arrest and apoptosis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020127-b014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020127-b017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020127-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;. One possible explanation for these observations would be that Vpr induces apoptosis as a downstream consequence of sustained G<sub>2</sub> checkpoint activation. This idea, however, is inconsistent with a previously published model in which Vpr was proposed to directly bind to the mitochondrial ANT to cause release of proapoptotic factors in a cell cycle&#x02013;independent manner &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020127-b023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020127-b024">24</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>To begin to differentiate between these models, we studied the kinetics of induction of G<sub>2</sub> arrest and apoptosis. If apoptosis were a consequence of G<sub>2</sub> checkpoint signaling, we would predict that G<sub>2</sub> arrest should precede the onset of apoptosis. However, if Vpr were binding ANT to induce apoptosis, we would predict that commitment to apoptosis should be independent of cell cycle status and would occur early following expression of Vpr. We transduced a human CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T-lymphocyte cell line, SupT1, with lentiviral vectors (pHR-VPR-G or pHR-VPR-R) expressing Vpr and either green fluorescent protein (GFP) or monomeric red fluorescent protein (mRFP), respectively, with an intervening internal ribosome entry site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020127-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). Having essentially identical vectors with different fluorescent tags allowed us to stain infected cells with a variety of fluorescent indicators of cell cycle profile and apoptosis. As a control, we used isogenic vectors expressing a mutant form of Vpr, pHR-VPR(R80A), wherein Vpr(R80A) is defective in induction of G<sub>2</sub> arrest and apoptosis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020127-b017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020127-b025">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020127-b027">27</xref>&#x0005d;.

In parallel experiments, we transduced SupT1 cells with VSV-G pseudotyped, env-defective vector derived from HIV-1<sub>NL4&#x02013;3</sub> (DHIV3; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020127-g001">Figure 1</xref>A) or a mutant form of the previous vector with Vpr deleted (DHIV3-&#x00394;VPR). At various time points, cultures were harvested and partitioned for further analyses. Analyses included cell cycle profile, induction of apoptosis as measured by caspase activation, and Western blot to detect release of Smac (second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase) into the cytoplasm.</p><p>Accumulation of Vpr-expressing cells at G<sub>2</sub> began at 24 h post-transduction, peaked at 48 h, and persisted throughout the remainder of the experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020127-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). In contrast, caspase activation in Vpr-expressing cells was first detected at 36 h and continued to increase throughout the remainder of the experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020127-g001">Figure 1</xref>C). Release of Smac (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020127-g001">Figure 1</xref>D) also occurred late, between 72 and 96 h post-transduction. Samples of flow cytometry charts from experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020127-g001">Figure 1</xref>C at the 72-h time point are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020127-g001">Figure 1</xref>E.</p><p>Therefore, induction of G<sub>2</sub> arrest is an early Vpr-mediated event, whereas release of Smac and caspase activation lag in relation to cell cycle arrest by approximately 24 h. Since G<sub>2</sub> arrest clearly precedes apoptosis, we found it compelling to ask whether transition into G<sub>2</sub> was required for the commitment to apoptosis in Vpr-expressing cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>G<sub>1</sub>/S Block Abolishes the Induction of Apoptosis by Vpr</title><p>We designed an experiment to prevent Vpr-expressing cells from entering G<sub>2</sub> and then asked whether these cells would still be susceptible to Vpr-induced apoptosis.

DNA content analysis showed that thymidine treatment effectively synchronized uninfected cells in G<sub>1</sub>/S (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020127-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). Thymidine synchronization of pHR-VPR-G&#x02013;infected cells resulted in 82.9&#x00025; cells in G<sub>1</sub>/S and 17.0&#x00025; cells in G<sub>2</sub>/M. The comparatively high number of cells in G<sub>2</sub>/M in the synchronized, pHR-VPR&#x02013;infected culture (17&#x00025;) reflects cells that reached G<sub>2</sub>/M prior to synchronization and arrested due to Vpr expression. To evaluate the frequency of apoptotic cells in these cultures, cells were stained with the nuclear dye 4&#x02032;,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI). DAPI binds to chromatin and reveals the presence of a conspicuous pyknotic nuclear morphology that is associated with late stages of apoptosis. We have previously described the use of DAPI for analysis of Vpr-induced apoptosis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020127-b017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020127-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d;. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020127-g002">Figure 2</xref>B shows fluorescence microscopy photographs from this analysis, and quantitations are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020127-g002">Figure 2</xref>C.

The background level of apoptosis in uninfected cells treated with thymidine was 4&#x00025;.</p><p>To address whether the decreased sensitivity of G<sub>1</sub>/S-arrested cells to Vpr-induced apoptosis could be due to thymidine treatment itself, cells were treated with a pharmacologic apoptosis inducer (etoposide or staurosporine) and then allowed to cycle, or not (thymidine incubation). Staurosporine is a kinase inhibitor and potent inducer of apoptosis with no known cell cycle specificity. Etoposide is a topoisomerase II inhibitor and an inducer of double-strand breaks (DSBs) and, like Vpr, causes G<sub>2</sub> arrest &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020127-b031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020127-b032">32</xref>&#x0005d;.

To determine whether induction of apoptosis by Vpr specifically requires transition into G<sub>2</sub>, cells were synchronized as in the previous experiment and then were released from thymidine block and allowed to reenter the cell cycle. Released cells were harvested at specified intervals to examine cell cycle progression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020127-g003">Figure 3</xref>A) and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020127-g003">Figure 3</xref>B). Both mock-treated and Vpr-expressing cells entered G<sub>2</sub> at 12 h postrelease. Mock-infected cells completed the first division cycle at 18 h postrelease and continued to cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020127-g003">Figure 3</xref>A, upper panels), while cells expressing Vpr persisted in G<sub>2</sub> for the remainder of the experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-0020127-g003">Figure 3</xref>A, lower panels). A small amount of cells (17.4&#x00025;) in the Vpr-transduced culture reached G<sub>1</sub> at 18 h postrelease.

Thus, we set out to compare in parallel the effect of ATR suppression on Vpr- versus genotoxin-induced apoptosis. We reasoned that if Vpr causes irreparable DNA damage, then the effect of checkpoint overriding on Vpr-induced apoptosis should mirror that of cells treated with genotoxic agents. To test this, we treated cells with siRNAs specific to ATR, ATM, or nonspecific siRNA.

In contrast, Vpr-induced caspase activation was dramatically inhibited by ATR knockdown (from 41.2&#x00025; to 14.2&#x00025;) but was unaffected by ATM knockdown (41.2&#x00025; to 39.4&#x00025;).

As positive and negative controls, we incubated cells with nocodazole (lanes 2 and 6) and doxorubicin (lanes 3 and 7), respectively. Doxorubicin is a genotoxic agent that intercalates into DNA, inhibits topoisomerase 2 and induces G<sub>2</sub> arrest via Cdc2 Tyr15 phosphorylation, without allowing mitotic entry. Nocodazole arrests cells in mitosis and exerts its effect by depolymerizing microtubules. HeLa cells transduced with pHR-VPR displayed a high level of H3 phosphorylation (lane 4), whereas transduced SupT1 cells displayed no detectable H3 phosphorylation (lane 8).

The levels of apoptosis, as judged by staining with FITC-VAD-FMK, were very similar between wild-type Vpr, Vpr(R77Q), and Vpr(I74A) and the levels of G<sub>2</sub> arrest were also similar. To more directly assess whether the frequencies of G<sub>2</sub> arrest and apoptosis correlated with each other, we calculated the ratio of cells in apoptosis over cells in G<sub>2</sub> for each mutant Vpr (&#x00025; apoptotic cells/&#x00025; cells in G<sub>2</sub>/M &#x0005b;Apo/G<sub>2</sub>M&#x0005d;). If a Vpr mutant induces normal levels of G<sub>2</sub> arrest, but reduced levels of apoptosis, then the Apo/G<sub>2</sub>M ratio should decrease. The Apo/G<sub>2</sub>M ratios were 0.83 for wild-type Vpr, 0.91 for Vpr(R77Q), and 0.92 for Vpr(I74A). Therefore, we conclude that neither of the Vpr mutants tested here resulted in lower levels of apoptosis induction, when compared to wild-type Vpr.</p><p>We previously demonstrated that Vpr induced phosphorylation BRCA1 at residue Ser1423 by the ATR kinase and that this phosphorylation correlated with induction of apoptosis &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020127-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;.

Both Vpr-GFP and Vpr(R80A)-GFP were able to induce apoptosis.

Surprisingly, Vpr(R80A)-GFP is also capable of inducing apoptosis. Because the fusion with carboxyl-terminal GFP turns Vpr(R80A), a nonproaptotic protein, into an apoptotic one, it appears that the induction of apoptosis by Vpr-GFP represents a gain-of-function phenotype and is not representative of the biology of wild-type Vpr.</p><p>In conclusion, our results suggest that induction of G<sub>2</sub> arrest and apoptosis by HIV-1 Vpr are functionally interrelated and not genetically separable.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3a"><title>The Functional Relationship between G<sub>2</sub> Arrest and Apoptosis</title><p>One gap in our current understanding of checkpoint signaling and apoptosis lies between the activation of nuclear checkpoint sentinels, such as ATR and ATM, and the involvement of Bcl-2 family of apoptosis regulators at the mitochondria.

Fisher et al. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020127-b067">67</xref>&#x0005d; proposed that R77Q is associated with certain viral subtypes, such as subtype A, and not with disease progression. A more recent analysis of the GenBank database revealed that R77 predominates in subtype B, whereas Q77 predominates in clades A, C, D, G, and H and groups O and N viruses, and subtype F and K strains frequently encode H77 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020127-b068">68</xref>&#x0005d;. Rajan et al. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020127-b068">68</xref>&#x0005d; also reported, using isogenic, full-length viruses, that HIV-1 carrying Q77 displayed reduced cytopathicity if the virus had R5 tropism but not if it had X4 tropism. The previous experiments did not uncouple the cytopathic potential of the virus strains from their replication kinetics. Therefore, in our studies, we wished to examine the proapoptotic potential of mutant Vpr proteins in the context of a nonreplicating lentiviral vector and in the absence of other viral genes. Our results conclusively show that in our experimental paradigm, the proapoptotic potentials of Vpr(R77Q) and Vpr(I74A) are indistinguishable from that of Vpr(R77). Thus, the results by Rajan et al. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat-0020127-b068">68</xref>&#x0005d; would seem to indicate that the R77Q substitution has a moderate, positive effect on cell viability, and this effect may be related to viral replication efficiency rather than to proapoptotic signaling.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Western blotting procedures.</title><p>For PARP and HA-Vpr detection, cells were detached with trypsin, washed once with media containing 10&#x00025; fetal bovine serum, and then washed twice in PBS.
