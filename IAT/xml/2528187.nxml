While it has long been known that the type II enzyme requires a divalent metal ion in order to cleave DNA, the role of the cation in this process is not known. To resolve this fundamental issue, the present study utilized a series of divalent metal ions with varying thiophilicities in conjunction with DNA cleavage substrates that replaced the 3&#x02032;-bridging oxygen of the scissile bond with a sulfur atom (i.e. 3&#x02032;-bridging phosphorothiolates). Rates and levels of DNA scission were greatly enhanced when thiophilic metal ions were included in reactions that utilized sulfur-containing substrates. Based on these results and those of reactions that employed divalent cation mixtures, we propose that topoisomerase II&#x003b1; mediates DNA cleavage via a two-metal-ion mechanism. In this model, one of the metal ions makes a critical interaction with the 3&#x02032;-bridging atom of the scissile phosphate. This interaction greatly accelerates rates of enzyme-mediated DNA cleavage, and most likely is needed to stabilize the leaving 3&#x02032;-oxygen.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Topoisomerase II&#x003b1; is essential for the proliferation of human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3 B4 B5">1&#x02013;5</xref>).

Topoisomerase II&#x003b1; has two identical subunits, each of which contains an active site tyrosine at position 805 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5 B6 B7 B8">5&#x02013;8</xref>). Each tyrosine is responsible for cutting one strand of the double helix, and forms a covalent bond with the 5&#x02032;-terminal phosphate that results from scission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8 B9 B10">8&#x02013;10</xref>). A 3&#x02032;-terminal &#x02013;OH moiety also is generated by the action of the enzyme. The two scissile bonds are located across the major groove, four bases apart from one another, such that the DNA cleavage event results in four-base, 5&#x02032;-overhanging cohesive ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>).</p><p>Beyond the role of the DNA cleavage event in the normal physiological functions of topoisomerase II&#x003b1;, this reaction is the primary cellular target for several widely prescribed anticancer agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11 B12 B13 B14">11&#x02013;14</xref>). These drugs, typified by compounds such as etoposide and doxorubicin, are front-line therapy for a variety of hematopoietic, germ-line and solid malignancies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11 B12 B13 B14">11&#x02013;14</xref>). Although topoisomerase II-targeted anticancer agents are derived from a number of structural classes, they all function by increasing cellular levels of the covalent enzyme&#x02013;cleaved DNA complex (i.e. cleavage complex) that is generated during the scission event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11 B12 B13 B14">11&#x02013;14</xref>).</p><p>Despite the importance of topoisomerase II-mediated DNA cleavage to the regulation of DNA topology and the treatment of human cancers, many aspects of the reaction are poorly understood. To this point, it has long been known that the type II enzyme requires a divalent metal ion in order to cleave DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15 B16 B17">15&#x02013;17</xref>), but the role of the cation is unclear.</p><p>Commonly, enzymes that cleave nucleic acids, including exo- and endonucleases, utilize divalent cations in their active sites to stabilize both attacking (i.e. amino acids and/or water) and leaving groups (i.e. DNA backbone oxygen atoms) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18 B19 B20 B21 B22 B23 B24 B25 B26 B27 B28 B29 B30 B31 B32 B33 B34 B35 B36 B37">18&#x02013;37</xref>). However, the number of metal ions per active site and the specific roles of these cations in stabilizing leaving groups (bridging versus nonbridging oxygen) varies. For example, based on structural studies, it has been proposed that several DNA polymerases utilize two divalent cations for both their 3&#x02032;&#x02192;5&#x02032; proofreading exonuclease and 5&#x02032;&#x02192;3&#x02032; polymerization reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Kinetic studies with these enzymes suggest that interactions between one of the active site divalent cations and the bridging oxygen of the DNA backbone play an important role in supporting catalysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). Although some ribozymes utilize two metal ions to catalyze self-splicing, others require only one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38 B39 B40 B41 B42 B43">38&#x02013;43</xref>). Furthermore, interactions with both the bridging and nonbridging oxygens have been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>). Finally, structural studies imply that the restriction endonuclease, <italic>Bgl</italic>II, uses only a single divalent cation and that it coordinates with the nonbridging oxygen of the scissile phosphate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>).</p><p>Based on mutagenesis and enzymological studies with DNA gyrase, Noble and Maxwell suggested that the prokaryotic type II topoisomerase utilizes a two-metal-ion mechanism similar to that of DNA polymerases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). However the specific roles of the divalent cations in DNA gyrase were not characterized.</p><p>Recently, a crystal structure of the catalytic core of yeast topoisomerase II complexed with DNA was solved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>). While the structure showed only a single Mg<sup>2+</sup> atom per active site, the enzyme&#x02013;DNA complex was noncovalent in nature. Furthermore, it was noted that the active site tyrosine was too far away from the scissile bond to be in a cleavage competent configuration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>). Consequently, the number of divalent metal ions in the active site of eukaryotic type II topoisomerases and their role(s) in the DNA cleavage reaction remain open questions.</p><p>To resolve these fundamental issues, the present study utilized a series of divalent metal ions with varying thiophilicities in conjunction with DNA cleavage substrates that replaced the 3&#x02032;-bridging oxygen of the scissile bond with a sulfur atom (i.e. 3&#x02032;-bridging phosphorothiolates).

Oligonucleotide substrates were always 5&#x02032;-end-labeled. Unless otherwise stated, DNA cleavage reactions contained 200 nM human topoisomerase II&#x003b1; and 100 nM double-stranded oligonucleotide in a total of 20 &#x003bc;l of cleavage buffer: 10 mM Tris&#x02013;HCl (pH 7.9), 135 mM KCl, 5 mM divalent cation, 0.1 mM EDTA and 2.5% glycerol. In some cases, the concentration of divalent cation (MgCl<sub>2</sub>, MnCl<sub>2</sub>, CaCl<sub>2</sub> or CoCl<sub>2</sub>) was varied and/or combinations of the cations were used. Studies incorporating experiments that monitored DNA cleavage over a range that included divalent cation concentrations below 1 mM utilized cleavage buffer that lacked EDTA. Reactions were initiated by the addition of enzyme and were incubated for 0&#x02013;30 min at 37&#x000b0;C. DNA cleavage products were trapped by the addition of 2 &#x003bc;l of 10% SDS followed by 2 &#x003bc;l of 250 mM NaEDTA (pH 8.0). Proteinase K (2 &#x003bc;l of 0.8 mg/ml) was added to digest the enzyme, and cleavage products were resolved by electrophoresis in a 14% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. To inhibit oxidation of cleaved oligonucleotides containing 3&#x02032;-terminal &#x02013;SH moieties and the formation of multimers in the gel, 100 mM DTT was added to the sample loading buffer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>).

The only cofactor that is required for DNA scission is a divalent metal ion, which appears to be Mg<sup>2+</sup><italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15 B16 B17">15&#x02013;17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). However, the contribution of the divalent cation to enzyme function is not understood. Therefore, the role of the metal ion in the DNA cleavage reaction mediated by human topoisomerase II&#x003b1; was characterized.</p><p>Several nucleases that generate a 3&#x02032;-OH and 5&#x02032;-phosphate during cleavage require an interaction between a metal ion and the 3&#x02032;-bridging atom of the scissile phosphate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). Consequently, as a first step in exploring the requirement for a divalent cation in the DNA cleavage reaction of human topoisomerase II&#x003b1;, the interaction between the divalent cation and the 3&#x02032;-bridging atom was assessed. Experiments took advantage of novel phosphorothiolate-containing oligonucleotide substrates that substituted a 3&#x02032;-bridging sulfur for the oxygen atom at the scissile phosphate (i.e. S&#x02013;P scissile bond) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>). Topoisomerase II&#x003b1; cleaves these oligonucleotides with all of the characteristics of wild-type substrates, with the following exception: since the resulting 3&#x02032;-terminal &#x02013;SH moiety is a poor nucleophile at phosphorous, 3&#x02032;-bridging phosphorothiolates do not support ligation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>). As a result, these substrates isolate the forward DNA scission event from ligation, and therefore allow high levels of cleavage complexes to accumulate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>). This is in contrast to wild-type oligonucleotides with 3&#x02032;-bridging oxygen atoms (i.e. O&#x02013;P scissile bond), which establish a rapid DNA cleavage&#x02013;ligation equilibrium and maintain low levels of cleavage complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>). Due to the characteristics of DNA scission with these substrates, both rates and levels of cleavage can be determined with S&#x02013;P oligonucleotides. However, only levels of cleavage can be monitored with O&#x02013;P oligonucleotides in &#x02018;bench top&#x02019; experiments.</p><p>Interactions between the divalent cation and the 3&#x02032;-bridging atom of the scissile phosphate were determined by comparing the ability of topoisomerase II&#x003b1; to cleave DNA substrates containing either a 3&#x02032;-bridging oxygen or sulfur atom in the presence of metal ions of varying &#x02018;hardness&#x02019; (i.e. thiophilicity). The ions that were used for this study were Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, Co<sup>2+</sup> and Mn<sup>2+</sup>. Within this series, Co<sup>2+</sup> and Mn<sup>2+</sup> are the &#x02018;softest&#x02019;, or most thiophilic metals, and Mg<sup>2+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> are harder, or less thiophilic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51 B52 B53">51&#x02013;53</xref>). Softer metal ions often prefer sulfur over oxygen as an inner-sphere ligand, while hard metals usually coordinate more readily with oxygen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38 B39 B40 B41 B42">38&#x02013;42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51 B52 B53">51&#x02013;53</xref>).</p><p>The DNA cleavage reaction of human topoisomerase II&#x003b1; generates a 3&#x02032;-oxygen leaving group in a divalent metal ion-dependent manner. If there is a direct interaction between the metal ion and the leaving group that facilitates catalysis, relative rates (or levels) of scission with substrates containing a 3&#x02032;-sulfur in place of the oxygen should increase in the presence of soft (thiophilic) metals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38 B39 B40 B41 B42">38&#x02013;42</xref>).

Since wild-type substrates attain a cleavage&#x02013;ligation equilibrium too quickly to ascertain rates in bench top experiments, a rapid chemical quench system was employed. Unfortunately, over the course of these assays (0&#x02013;3 s), levels of cleavage of wild-type O&#x02013;P oligonucleotides were too low to generate reliable rate constants. Therefore, a nick was introduced at the scissile bond on the opposite strand from the one being monitored. These nicked oligonucleotides do not act as &#x02018;suicide substrates&#x02019;, and rapidly reach a cleavage&#x02013;ligation equilibrium when opposite an O&#x02013;P scissile bond (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>). However, they maintain &#x0223c;10-fold higher levels of cleavage complexes at equilibrium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>).</p><p>As a prelude to rapid quench experiments, bench top assays were carried out with these nicked substrates. Results were similar to those obtained with the corresponding un-nicked oligonucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). Accordingly, Mn<sup>2+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Co<sup>2+</sup> all supported higher levels of DNA cleavage than Mg<sup>2+</sup> with the O&#x02013;P substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, left panel). Furthermore, rates and levels of cleavage observed in the presence of Mn<sup>2+</sup> and Co<sup>2+</sup> were higher than those generated with Mg<sup>2+</sup> using the S&#x02013;P substrate, and the initial velocity of DNA cleavage supported by Ca<sup>2+</sup> was &#x0003e;10 times slower than that seen with Mg<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>, right panel). Once again, these findings support the conclusion that the divalent metal ion interacts with the bridging atom of the scissile bond and promotes the DNA cleavage reaction of topoisomerase II&#x003b1;. <fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><p>Cleavage of nicked oligonucleotide substrates by topoisomerase II&#x003b1; in the presence of different divalent metal ions.

Of the three divalent cations employed, only 5 mM Mn<sup>2+</sup> was able to support efficient cleavage at the +1/+2 S&#x02013;P site.

In addition, the initial phase that was seen with Ca<sup>2+</sup> was more pronounced than observed with Mn<sup>2+</sup>. When cleavage of the S&#x02013;P oligonucleotide was monitored (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>, right panel), the opposite was seen. While the initial phase observed with Mn<sup>2+</sup> became more prominent, that with Ca<sup>2+</sup> essentially disappeared. The biphasic metal ion concentration dependence implies that there are two divalent cation sites in the DNA cleavage&#x02013;ligation site of topoisomerase II&#x003b1; and that both need to be filled in order to support scission. The finding that the initial (i.e. high affinity) phase with the S&#x02013;P substrate became more prominent with the softer metal ion (Mn<sup>2+</sup>) and was lost with the harder metal ion (Ca<sup>2+</sup>), suggests that the first site that is filled by the divalent cation is the one that interacts with the bridging atom of the scissile bond.</p><p>A second approach was employed to confirm that two metal ions are required to support DNA cleavage mediated by human topoisomerase II&#x003b1;. These studies took advantage of the enhanced affinity of Mn<sup>2+</sup> and the decreased affinity of Ca<sup>2+</sup> for substrates with 3&#x02032;-bridging sulfur atoms. Experiments compared levels and rates of DNA scission monitored in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Mn<sup>2+</sup> or a combination of the two divalent cations. Near saturating concentrations of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (5 and 2.5 mM with the O&#x02013;P and S&#x02013;P oligonucleotides, respectively) were paired with concentrations of Mn<sup>2+</sup> that bound the scissile bond site without appreciably filling the second site (25 and 5 &#x000b5;M with the O&#x02013;P and S&#x02013;P oligonucleotides, respectively). These limiting concentrations of Mn<sup>2+</sup> supported levels of enzyme-mediated DNA cleavage that were &#x0223c;10-fold lower than generated at the concentrations of Ca<sup>2+</sup> that were used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p>Combining metal ions in reactions that utilized a wild-type substrate had little effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>, left panel).

This result was not surprising, since cleavage of the O&#x02013;P bond of the site 1b oligonucleotide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>) was stimulated only moderately by the presence of the two metal ions.

Furthermore, a large enhancement in the rate and level of DNA scission (compared to calculated sums) was observed when 2.5 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> was combined with a range of Mn<sup>2+</sup> concentrations (1&#x02013;10 &#x000b5;M) that partially filled or saturated the high affinity scissile bond site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F9">Figure 9</xref>). It is notable that once the scissile bond site was saturated with Mn<sup>2+</sup> (7.5 &#x000b5;M), the inclusion of higher levels of Mn<sup>2+</sup> did not stimulate DNA cleavage further. <fig id="F9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><p>Cleavage of nicked S&#x02013;P (<italic>T<sub>N</sub></italic><sub>&#x02212;1/+1</sub>/<italic>B</italic><sub>S</sub>*) oligonucleotide substrates by topoisomerase II&#x003b1; in the presence of different divalent metal ions. DNA cleavage reactions were carried out for 15, 30 or 60 s in the presence of 2.5 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> alone (open bars), 1&#x02013;10 &#x003bc;M Mn<sup>2+</sup> alone (stippled bars), or a mixture of 2.5 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> and 1&#x02013;10 &#x003bc;M Mn<sup>2+</sup> (Ca<sup>2+</sup> + Mn<sup>2+</sup>, closed bars). The calculated sum of the enzyme-mediated DNA cleavage from reactions containing either Ca<sup>2+</sup> or Mn<sup>2+</sup> alone is also shown (Sum, stacked open and stippled bars, respectively).

Amino acids that are postulated to interact with the metal ions in the active site of topoisomerase II&#x003b1; are D541, D543, D545 and E461. These assignments are based on previous enzymological studies of altered <italic>E. coli</italic> gyrase proteins in which homologous residues were mutated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>), as well as structural studies of prokaryotic topoisomerase III, primase (dnaG) and other DNA enzymes that contain the Toprim domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55 B56 B57">55&#x02013;57</xref>). Moreover, they are consistent with a recent crystal structure of the yeast topoisomerase II catalytic core in a complex with nicked DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>). In this structure, residues homologous to D541, D543 and E461 of the human enzyme were in close proximity to the observed Mg<sup>2+</sup> atom. However, as noted earlier, the yeast topoisomerase II-DNA complex was noncovalent in nature and the active site tyrosine was too far away from the scissile bond to promote cleavage. Mutagenesis studies with topoisomerase II&#x003b1; currently are underway to address the validity of these assignments in the human enzyme. <fig id="F10" position="float"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><p>A two-metal-ion model for DNA cleavage by human topoisomerase II&#x003b1;. Details are described in the text. Amino acids that are postulated to interact with the metal ions in the active site of topoisomerase II&#x003b1; are D541, D543, D545 and E461. Corresponding amino acids in the A subunit of <italic>E. coli</italic> DNA gyrase are shown for comparison. The model postulates that one of the metal ions (left, shown in red) makes a critical interaction with the 3&#x02032;-bridging atom of the scissile phosphate (bond shown in blue), which most likely is needed to stabilize the leaving 3&#x02032;-oxygen (shown in green). While a second metal ion (right, shown in red) is required for DNA scission, our data provide no direct insight into its specific role during cleavage. However, based on a model proposed for <italic>E. coli</italic> DNA gyrase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>), this divalent cation may stabilize the DNA transition state and/or help deprotonate the active site tyrosine (Y805). Finally, if an interaction between one of the metal ions (or both) and the nonbridging atoms of the scissile phosphate exists, it does not appear to have a major effect on rates of DNA scission. The figure was adapted from Ref. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="gkn466f10"/></fig></p><p>Our model for topoisomerase II&#x003b1; has two salient features. The first is a critical interaction between one of the divalent metal ions and the 3&#x02032;-bridging atom of the scissile phosphate. This interaction greatly accelerates rates of enzyme-mediated DNA cleavage and most likely is needed to stabilize the leaving 3&#x02032;-oxygen. While kinetic studies cannot rule out an interaction between a metal ion and the nonbridging atoms of the scissile phosphate, such an interaction (if it exists) does not appear to have a major effect on rates of DNA scission.</p><p>The other important feature is a requirement for a second divalent metal ion in the DNA cleavage&#x02013;ligation active site of the human type II enzyme. Although our data provide strong evidence for the presence of this second metal ion, they offer no direct insight into the specific role that it plays during DNA scission. However, based on a model proposed for <italic>E. coli</italic> DNA gyrase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>), we postulate that this divalent cation may stabilize the DNA transition state and/or help deprotonate the active site tyrosine (Y805).</p><p>In conclusion, while type II topoisomerases require a divalent metal ion in order to cleave DNA, the role of the cation in the scission process was not understood. Based on the studies described above, we propose that human topoisomerase II&#x003b1; cleaves DNA using a two-metal-ion mechanism in which one of the divalent cations makes a critical interaction with the 3&#x02032;-bridging atom of the scissile phosphate and facilitates the cleavage event.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>We would like to express our appreciation to Dr F.
