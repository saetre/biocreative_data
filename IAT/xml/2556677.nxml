Pathogenic Ye strains carry a 70-kb plasmid (pYV), which is essential for the pathogenicity and encodes a type III secretion system (TTSS), <italic>Yersinia </italic>outer proteins (Yops) and YadA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The TTSS enables extracellularly located yersiniae to translocate at least six effector Yops directly into host cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The Yops interfere with different signaling pathways involved in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton, phagocytosis, apoptosis and in the inflammatory response, thus favoring survival of the bacteria in an extracellular tissue compartment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. YopH, YopE, YopT, and YopO/YpkA disturb cytoskeletal dynamics and thereby inhibit phagocytosis by polymorphonuclear leukocytes and macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. YopH, a tyrosine phosphatase, causes disruption of focal adhesion complex structures and inhibits the oxidative burst [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Among others, the host cell targets of YopH in epithelial cells are the focal adhesion proteins Crk-associated substrate (p130Cas) and focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and in macrophages p130Cas, Fyn-binding protein (Fyb) and SKAP-HOM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. YopH mutants, which are unable to bind p130Cas, do not localize to focal complex structures in infected cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. These YopH mutants showed reduced virulence in mice, suggesting that binding to p130Cas and/or Fyb is biologically relevant in <italic>Yersinia </italic>infections. Other functions of YopH include the inhibition of the phosphatidyl-inositol 3 kinase (PI3K)/Akt signaling pathway which is activated in macrophages upon interaction with <italic>Yersinia </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], and downstream effects such as expression of the chemokine monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1, CCL2), an important chemotactic factor for macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>The phosphatase activity of YopH inhibits the ability of T cells to produce cytokines and proliferate, as well as the ability of B cells to express the B-cell co-stimulatory receptor CD86, possibly by dephosphorylating critical tyrosine residues on signaling proteins involved in T- and B-cell activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The biological relevance of YopH is underlined by different reports demonstrating that the lack of YopH results in reduced virulence of <italic>Yersinia </italic>in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we addressed whether and how YopH might affect the innate immune response in mice. Upon infection with <italic>Y. enterocolitica </italic>O8 strain WA-314 (pYV<sup>+</sup>) or a YopH deletion mutant (&#x00394;<italic>yopH</italic>) alterations in gene expression in CD11b<sup>+ </sup>cells was analyzed. These cells include mostly granulocytes and macrophages and to a lower extent dendritic cells and NK cells. CD11b<sup>+ </sup>cells were chosen because they are the most important spleen cell subpopulations involved in innate immune responses. The data reported herein provide strong evidence that IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-6 are not necessarily required for clearance of <italic>Y. enterocolitica </italic>&#x00394;<italic>yopH </italic>and that IFN-&#x003b3; compensates YopH-mediated immune evasion mechanisms in macrophages.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>YopH deletion attenuates <italic>Yersinia enterocolitica </italic>in mice</title><p>In this study, we addressed how the virulence factor YopH affects the early innate immune responses to <italic>Yersinia enterocolitica in vivo</italic>.

The total number of macrophages was significantly increased one day after the sublethal infection with both pYV<sup>+ </sup>and &#x00394;<italic>yopH </italic>compared with mock-infected mice. In contrast, under lethal conditions a significant increase in the number of macrophages was only detected after infection with pYV<sup>+ </sup>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). The number of granulocytes was significantly increased after sublethal as well as lethal infection with pYV<sup>+ </sup>but not after sublethal or lethal &#x00394;<italic>yopH </italic>infection (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). The number of dendritic cells was similar in all conditions one day after infection (data not shown).</p><p>From this data we can conclude that by variation of the inoculum for pYV<sup>+ </sup>and &#x00394;<italic>yopH </italic>infections, conditions can be achieved that lead either to comparable infection course (lethal or sublethal) or to comparable bacterial burden in the spleen as well as to comparable alterations in the composition of splenic cell populations.

RNA was extracted and subjected to gene expression analysis using Affymetrix MG-U74Av2 microarrays. First, we identified all genes which were more than 3-fold higher or more than 3-fold lower expressed after infection with either a sublethal or a lethal dose of pYV<sup>+ </sup>or &#x00394;<italic>yopH</italic> compared to uninfected mice resulting in 1428 probe sets. These probe sets were used in the following analyses.</p></sec><sec><title>Gene expression analyses reveal differences between pYV<sup>+ </sup>and &#x00394;<italic>yopH </italic>infection</title><p>Two approaches were selected, to help identify immune response genes whose expression differs after infection with pYV<sup>+ </sup>and &#x00394;<italic>yopH</italic>. In the first approach, gene expression of CD11b<sup>+ </sup>cells from mice after sublethal pYV<sup>+ </sup>and sublethal &#x00394;<italic>yopH </italic>infection was compared. This method was used to compare gene expression associated with similar outcome of disease; however, the different bacterial splenic counts and different composition of CD11b<sup>+ </sup>subpopulations has to be considered in subsequent comparative analyses. In a second approach, we compared gene expression of CD11b<sup>+ </sup>cells from mice with comparable bacterial splenic counts after infection with pYV<sup>+ </sup>and &#x00394;<italic>yopH</italic>. To accomplish this, we compared mice after sublethal pYV<sup>+ </sup>and lethal &#x00394;<italic>yopH </italic>infection resulting in similar splenic bacterial counts one day p.i. (~10<sup>5 </sup>CFU) in the spleen. In both approaches k-means cluster analysis was carried out to characterize groups of co-expressed genes.

This capability appears to be attributed to its ability to inhibit phagocytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. and T cell activation through the intracytoplasmic action of YopH in phagocytes and T cells, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>The goal of this study was to investigate whether and how YopH might interfere with the innate immune response <italic>in vivo</italic>. To this end, the gene expression profiles prior to and after infection with pYV<sup>+ </sup>or &#x00394;<italic>yopH </italic>were analyzed in CD11b<sup>+ </sup>cells from the spleen of infected mice. CD11b<sup>+ </sup>cells were chosen because they represent the most important spleen cell subpopulation involved in innate immune responses such as granulocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells and have been demonstrated to be involved in or targeted by Ye infection.</p><p>The major problem with <italic>in vivo </italic>studies using Ye mutants is that mutations in major pathogenicity factors such as YopH affect virulence of Ye <italic>in vivo</italic>. Consequently, infection of mice with the same infection dose of wild type and mutant Ye ultimately results in different bacterial burden in infected organs. This gives rise to (i) different immune stimulation by Ye compounds and, as demonstrated herein, (ii) different recruitment of inflammatory cells and hence (iii) different composition of CD11b<sup>+ </sup>spleen cell subpopulations. As a result, the differences in gene expression between wild type and mutant Ye might reflect both direct and indirect effects of virulence factors such as YopH. As an alternative, mice can be infected with different doses of wild type and mutant Ye, which will lead to comparable bacterial burden in infected organs such as the spleen. In this study we used both approaches and compared gene expression in mice infected with identical doses of wild type and mutant Ye (leading to different bacterial burden and clinical outcome) and variable doses (leading to comparable bacterial burden and clinical outcome). However, in the latter approach we could not rule out effects in gene expression that may result from different spleen cell subpopulations. Additional comparisons were performed, such as comparison of sublethal wildtype with lethal wildtype infection, as well as sublethal &#x00394;<italic>yopH </italic>with lethal &#x00394;<italic>yopH </italic>infection because the information obtained was mostly redundant to those already received with the comparisons discussed below.</p><p>We focused on the differences in genes known to be involved in immune responses. Sublethal pYV<sup>+ </sup>and lethal &#x00394;<italic>yopH </italic>infection results in the same bacterial burden in the spleen but shows some differences in the composition of the cell populations expressing CD11b such as granulocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells. However, comparison of the expression between sublethal pYV<sup>+ </sup>and lethal &#x00394;<italic>yopH </italic>infection reveals that acute phase reactants and other genes involved in innate immune response such as the antimicrobial component lactoferrin and MARCO (playing a role in clearance of pneumococcal infections) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] are increased after &#x00394;<italic>yopH </italic>infection compared to pYV<sup>+</sup>infection. Since acute phase reactants are predominantly constitutively expressed, the differences in gene expression after sublethal pYV<sup>+ </sup>and lethal &#x00394;<italic>yopH </italic>infection may be due to changes in the composition of the cell populations which express CD11b but nevertheless may be also associated with lethal course of &#x00394;<italic>yopH </italic>infection.</p><p>IL-10 and CCL17 were found to be higher expressed after sublethal pYV<sup>+ </sup>versus lethal pYV<sup>+ </sup>infection as well as after sublethal versus lethal &#x00394;<italic>yopH </italic>infection, respectively. Since each of these conditions was associated with a comparable composition of the cell populations expressing CD11b in the spleen we conclude that increased expression of IL-10 and CCL17 is not due to differences in the composition of CD11b<sup>+ </sup>cells. Previous studies suggested that the secreted Ye protein LcrV of O8 strains binds to TLR2 and triggers increased IL-10 secretion in macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. In line with this, it was shown that infection with an inocolum of pYV<sup>+ </sup>which is lethal for wildtype mice can be survived by IL-10<sup>-/- </sup>mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] indicating that IL-10 is a marker for lethal or sublethal course of infection. However, this might not be a general observation for all <italic>Yersinia </italic>strains or species since TLR2 activity and probably IL-10 secretion induced by LcrV vary due to a hypervariable region in the N-terminus of LcrV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. In addition, the highest TLR2 activity was found for O8 strains as used in this study. Likewise, CCL17, a chemokine which attracts Th2 and regulatory T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. could also be involved in driving infections in direction of a lethal course; this, however, has to be more thorougly investigated in further studies.</p><p>Since a high number of genes showed a lower expression after sublethal &#x00394;<italic>yopH </italic>infection we focused predominantly on this aspect. Within this group several proinflammatory response genes dependent on TLR signaling such as IL-12, CXCL1, CXCL2 and TNF-&#x003b1; but also IFN-&#x003b3; were predominantly found. Since cytokines and chemokines act as secreted proteins the overall expression levels may be of more relevance than the subpopulation of cells which expresses these genes. In addition, histidine decarboxylase was found in this group of genes. The expression of histidine decarboxylase seems to reflect the importance of histamine signaling for control of Ye infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. The improved reduction of the bacterial burden as found after infection with a sublethal dose of &#x00394;<italic>yopH </italic>is associated with a lower expression of such genes. The weaker immune response found after infection with &#x00394;<italic>yopH </italic>may reflect the more effective clearance of bacteria but may also raise the possibility that components of this immune response are no longer required to control the infection. Previous data suggested that IL-12, IL-18 and TNF-&#x003b1; may not be required for clearance of &#x00394;<italic>yopH </italic>infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. In line with these findings we have shown that IFN-&#x003b3; and IL-6 may also not be required for clearance of a &#x00394;<italic>yopH </italic>infection. Thus, clearance of infection in the spleen is comparable in C57BL/6 and congenic IFN-&#x003b3;R<sup>-/- </sup>mice. Similar experiments were performed using IL-6<sup>-/- </sup>mice, indicating that IL-6 is not necessarily required for clearance of &#x00394;<italic>yopH </italic>infection.</p><p>Other groups found that oral infection of BALB/c mice with a <italic>Y. pseudotuberculosis yopH </italic>mutant resulted in a similar bacterial burden in the spleen five days after infection of IFN-&#x003b3;<sup>-/- </sup>and IFN-&#x003b3;<sup>+/+ </sup>mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Interestingly, by co-infection of <italic>Y. pseudotuberculosis </italic>wild type and <italic>yopH </italic>mutant it has been demonstrated that in the presence of IFN-&#x003b3; the <italic>yopH </italic>mutant is more efficiently killed in comparison to wild type. On the contrary, in the absence of IFN-&#x003b3; the survival advantage of the wildtype <italic>Y. pseudotuberculosis </italic>compared to the <italic>yopH </italic>mutant is much weaker [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. This data supports the view that IFN-&#x003b3; is required for clearance of wildtype <italic>Yersinia </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] but plays a minor role for clearance of &#x00394;<italic>yopH </italic>mutant and would explain at least in this case similarities between <italic>Y. pseudotuberculosis </italic>and Ye infection of mice.</p><p>There is substantial knowledge about IFN-&#x003b3; mediated effector mechanisms in host defense against pathogens, such as promotion of TH1 responses, induction of expression of 47 kDa GTPases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], oxidative burst or antigen presentation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]; however, the exact effector mechanisms induced by IFN-&#x003b3; for clearance of a <italic>Yersinia </italic>infection are not yet defined. By determining killing of BMDM upon infection with Ye we demonstrate that killing of yersiniae by BMDM is quite efficient. However, in contrast to &#x00394;<italic>yopH</italic>, pYV<sup>+ </sup>is less efficiently cleared by BMDM indicating that YopH inhibits killing of yersiniae to some extent. In addition pretreatment of BMDM with IFN-&#x003b3; bypasses indirectly or directly YopH mediated resistance of killing of yersiniae. This data further supports the idea that IFN-&#x003b3; is not necessarily needed to defeat <italic>Yersinia </italic>lacking YopH. However, YopH may also exert other immune evasion mechanisms. In fact, YopH also inhibits T cell activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Previous data demonstrates that infection of athymic, T cell deficient C57BL/6 nude mice leads to an increased bacterial number in the spleen starting only three days after infection compared to infection with C57BL/6 mice suggesting that T cell responses are already involved in the early phase of Ye infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].</p><p>Taken together, the data presented herein show that IFN-&#x003b3; bypasses or compensates for immune evasion mechanism of YopH. Moreover, we provide evidence that improvement in killing of bacteria by macrophages may represent part of the effector functions of IFN-&#x003b3; to compensate for immune evasion mechanisms provided by the interplay of the effector Yops of the Ysc-Yop type three secretion system and that deletion of YopH enables the immune defense to work efficiently without the presence of IFN-&#x003b3;. However, further studies need to define whether alterations in the immune response against YopH deletion mutant are solely due to the phosphatase activity of YopH or whether they also may be due to changes in the secretion of some of the other Yops (e.g. YopT, YopP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Moreover, future studies are needed to define the crucial mechanisms important for clearance of <italic>Yersinia </italic>infection <italic>in vivo </italic>and to elucidate which IFN-&#x003b3; induced genes are important to bypass <italic>Yersinia </italic>mediated inhibition of yersiniae killing. However, since beside IFN-&#x003b3; other genes such as IL-6, TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-12, IL-18 are not necessarily required for clearance of Ye infection with &#x00394;<italic>yopH</italic>, it can be speculated that YopH does not counteract the effector functions of one of those genes specifically but rather a proinflammatory response in general.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Bacterial strains and plasmids</title><p>For infection the Ye O:8 strain WA-314 (pYV<sup>+</sup>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], and derivatives of this strain were used.

Results were quantified using the 2<sup>-&#x00394;&#x00394;C</sup><sub>T </sub>method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Cytokine mRNA expression levels were normalized to the expression of the houskeeping gene ribosomal protein L8 (RPL8). All PCR experiments were performed in duplicate, and standard deviations were calculated and displayed as error bars.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis of intracellular survival by CFU assay</title><p>Intracellular survival was determined with modification as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5 </sup>BMDM resuspended in DMEM (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany), containing 10% FCS (Sigma, Taufkirchen, Germany), supplemented with Na-pyruvate at 1 mM (Biochrom, Berlin, Germany), and 2 mM L-glutamine (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) were seeded into 24 well cell culture plates and incubated overnight. Bacteria were grown overnight at 27&#x000b0;C in LB medium and subcultivated for 2 h at 37&#x000b0;C. The bacteria were washed twice with PBS and finally diluted as needed in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat inactivated fetal calf serum, 2 mM L-glutamine and 1 mM Na-pyruvate. The bacterial number was diluted to a MOI of 5. After addition of bacteria cell culture plates were centrifuged for 5 minutes at 200 &#x000d7; g to facilitate contact of bacteria. After 15 minutes of infection cells were washed twice with PBS. Some of the wells were used to determine initial number of cell associated bacteria by a CFU assay. To the remaining cells cell culture medium containing 8 &#x003bc;g per ml gentamicin was added. After one hour the medium was removed and complete cell culture medium was added containing 4.5 mg/ml gentamicin. Three or five hours after infection a CFU assay was performed as described recently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Statistics</title><p>The data shown in the figures are from representative experiments.
