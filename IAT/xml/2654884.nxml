A striking migration is undertaken by the facial branchiomotor neurons (FBMs) of the mammalian embryonic hindbrain. In the mouse embryo, FBM neurons differentiate within rhombomere 4 (r4), while facial visceral motor neurons differentiate in r5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. FBM neurons extend axons via the facial nerve (between embryonic day (E)10.5 and E13.5); concomitantly, neuronal somata migrate caudally from r4 to r6 commencing around E10.5, and finally migrate radially within r6 to form the facial motor nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. There is very little information about the molecules that drive FBM migration in the mouse embryo. Here we demonstrate for the first time a role for the Wnt/planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway in this process in mammals.</p><p>In vertebrates, the PCP pathway has been shown to function during the convergent extension movements of gastrulation and neurulation, and in hair cell polarisation (reviewed by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]). The 'non-canonical Wnts', including Wnt5a, Wnt7a and Wnt11 are implicated in these processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Although the evidence linking Wnts with the PCP pathway is controversial, PCP signalling operates via Frizzleds (Fzs), and the membrane protein VanGogh-like 2 (Vangl2), while the cytoplasmic protein Scribble1 (Scrb1; which has been linked to apico-basal polarity) may also play a role. These components activate Dishevelled, which activates RhoA/Rho kinase (ROCK), and/or Rac and c-Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK), leading to phosphorylation of molecules involved in cytoskeletal dynamics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The Wnt/PCP molecule Vangl2 can bind to Dishevelled, and can signal via both ROCK and JNK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. In addition, Wnt5a can activate JNK to influence convergent extension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], and is required for the localisation of Vangl2 in cochlear hair cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Thus, it is plausible that in FBM migration, JNK and ROCK form part of a signalling cascade containing Wnt5a, Fz, Vangl2, and other PCP components. Other downstream kinases that might function in FBM migration include myosin light chain kinase (MLCK), which is phosphorylated by ROCK and is implicated in cell migration (reviewed by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]).</p><p>While recent (mainly loss-of-function) studies suggest that the Wnt/PCP pathway functions in FBM migration in the zebrafish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], it is unclear which mechanisms operate in mammals (reviewed by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]). In mice, there are few studies on the mechanisms of FBM migration, although vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has been proposed as a chemoattractant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. In this paper, we demonstrate a role of Wnts, other Wnt/PCP components and their downstream signalling pathways in the migration of FBM mammalian neurons.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Animals</title><p>For appropriate gestational ages, we counted 0.5 days post-coitus as the formation of a vaginal plug on the following morning after matings.

For chemoattraction affinity bead experiments, Cibacron blue 3AG agarose beads (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) were soaked in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; control) or in 100 &#x003bc;g/ml of either Wnt5a, Wnt7a, Semaphorin 3A (Sema3A; R&#x00026;D systems) or VEGF (Peprotech Inc., London, UK) at 4&#x000b0;C overnight, before implantation into hindbrain explants. For the inhibitor experiments, explants were treated with culture medium containing either 10 &#x003bc;M JNK inhibitor (SP 600125, Tocris Bioscience, Bristol UK), 10 &#x003bc;M ROCK inhibitor (Y27632, Calbiochem, UK) or 10 &#x003bc;M MLCK inhibitor (ML-7, Calbiochem). In some cases, inhibitors were applied to hindbrain explants containing Wnt beads to test whether chemoattraction by beads was blocked. For inhibition of Wnt function, a cocktail of secreted frizzed-related proteins (SFRPs; 1, 2 and 3; 500 ng/ml; R&#x00026;D systems) was applied to explants in the culture medium. Although binding specificities of SFRPs are not completely characterised, SFRP 1 and 2 can bind Wnt5a (for example, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]). A combination of SFRPs was applied to block a spectrum of putative Wnt-mediated interactions. After 2 days, explants were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 1 hour and processed for immunohistochemistry.</p></sec><sec><title>Immunohistochemistry and scoring of FBM migration in explants</title><p>After fixation, explants were washed several times with PBS containing 1% Triton (PBT) then blocked in PBT containing 10% sheep serum for 30 minutes. Subsequently, the explants were incubated overnight at 4&#x000b0;C with anti-Islet1/2 antibody (4D5; 1:200; Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, Iowa City, IA, USA), then washed with PBT for several hours, and afterwards incubated for 1 hour with Cy3 anti-mouse secondary antibody (1:800; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories Inc., West Grove, PA, USA). Finally, the explants were washed with PBT and mounted on slides using Fluor-Save (Calbiochem).</p><p>Each explant was scored blind using one of the two following scoring systems. For bead implantation chemoattraction assays, explants were scored as 'attraction' if FBM neurons were deflected from their normal trajectory or as 'no attraction' if the FBM migration stream was unperturbed. Explants containing beads plus inhibitors were scored in the same way, focussing on whether FBM cells were deflected from the migration path, rather than on the migration as a whole. For explants treated with inhibitors, explants were scored on a scale of 1&#x02013;3, ranging from loss of migration (1) to intermediate loss of migration (2) to normal migration (3). As some neurons had already reached r5 in most explants at the time of culture, we scored loss of migration (1) as a failure of neurons to reach r6 and/or a reduction in the number of neurons that had reached r5. Intermediate loss of migration was scored if explants manifest a phenotype between normal and loss of migration, that is, some neurons having reached r6 but less than in the normal case. In some experiments using inhibitors, the dorsal migration of trigeminal motor neurons in r2/3 was also quantified on a 1&#x02013;3 scale. For each treatment, the percentage of explants in each category was calculated and compared statistically between control and treated groups (&#x003c7;-squared test).</p></sec><sec><title>Quantification of FBM migration in explants and in <italic>Wnt5a </italic>mutant embryos</title><p>For experiments with control (PBS-treated) beads, Wnt5a-treated beads alone or with JNK or ROCK inhibitors, migration was quantified using the Scion image (NIH image) programme. Confocal images were rendered in black and white and inverted so that black pixels represented migrating neurons. For explants containing beads, a box was drawn containing the beads themselves (located at the r3/4 boundary) and encompassing r4 ipsilateral to the beads up to the midpoint of the floor plate (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1A</xref>). The number of pixels within the box was counted and the mean number of pixels under each condition was presented graphically. For explants without beads and cultured as controls or with inhibitors, a box was drawn over r4 bilaterally and over r6 bilaterally, containing the FBM neuron migratory stream (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1E</xref>). The ratio of r6 pixels/r4 pixels gives an indication of how successfully migration has occurred. The mean ratio was calculated under each condition. For <italic>Wnt5a </italic>mutant embryos and wild-type littermates, the width of the FBM migratory stream was measured at a dorsoventral midpoint using the Scion image programme to quantify the defect.

Hindbrains were dissected out early on E11.5, as it was found that isolation of hindbrains on E10.5 led to poor tissue and motor neuron viability. Immunostaining of explants with anti-Islet-1/2 antibody at time 0 showed that most FBM neurons were located in r4, whereas a minority had migrated into r5 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1G</xref>). After 24 hours <italic>in vitro</italic>, many FBM neurons had reached r5 and some had reached r6 and started to turn laterally (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1H</xref>). After 48 hours, FBM neurons had reached r6 and coalesced into a characteristic compact nucleus (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1I</xref>), reflecting a similar or slightly later developmental stage than that observed using <italic>Islet-1 in situ </italic>hybridisation on E12.5 hindbrains (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F</xref>). Other branchiomotor neurons, such as those of the trigeminal nucleus, which undergo a lateral migration, were also visualised using Islet-1/2 immunostaining (data not shown).</p><p>We tested the effects of Wnt proteins on this migration pattern, using beads soaked in Wnt5a or Wnt7a protein (or PBS controls) in E11.5 hindbrain explants cultured for 48 hours. These are 'non-canonical' Wnts, which have been linked to convergent extension movements in fish and frogs (reviewed by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]). When PBS-soaked control beads were placed unilaterally in rostral r4, we found that the FBM migration resembled that in controls, that is, cells were not deflected from their normal migration route (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A, A'</xref>). However, placement of beads soaked in Wnt5a or Wnt7a protein led to a coalescence of FBM neurons around the beads, suggesting that there was a chemoattractant effect (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B, B'</xref>). FBM neurons in r4 and also in r5 migrated laterally, and in some cases cells from the contralateral side also moved across the midline towards the beads. Three-dimensional confocal images of these explants suggested that FBM neurons had collected around the beads. Explants containing either PBS-soaked or Wnt-soaked beads were then scored blind as to whether FBM neurons were deflected from their normal course ('attraction') or not ('no attraction'). Quantification and statistical analysis showed that this effect was significantly different from controls (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). We also quantified migration in the presence of Wnt-coated and PBS control beads by pixel counting using the Scion image programme (see Materials and methods; Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1A, B</xref>). This method also showed a significant difference between the two groups. In separate experiments, Wnt beads were also presented in r6/r7 to test whether they could attract FBM neurons caudally. An effect was detected, but showed somewhat less clearly that FBM neurons deviated from their pathway than that obtained from rostral placement of beads, possibly because of the proximity to the normal migration route/FBM nucleus (data not shown). However, our data are consistent with a role for Wnts in the caudal and lateral displacement of FBM neurons.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Chemoattractant effect of Wnt proteins in hindbrain explants</bold>. <bold>(A-B') </bold>Embryonic stage (E)11.5 mouse hindbrain explants with Wnt-coated beads placed in a region of rhombomere (r)4 rostral and lateral to the facial branchiomotor migratory stream: (A) phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) control; (B) Wnt protein; (A', B') higher magnifications of regions in boxes in (A, B), respectively.

Whole-mount <italic>in situ </italic>hybridisation at E11.5 showed that in isolated neuroepithelial preparations, <italic>Wnt7a </italic>is expressed throughout the hindbrain, including a dorsal stripe and the floor plate (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). Cryosections <italic>in situ</italic>-hybridised for <italic>Wnt7a </italic>mRNA showed that this expression was in the ventricular zone and generally in the neuroepithelium (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B&#x02013;D</xref>). Intriguingly, whole-mount <italic>in situ </italic>hybridisation for <italic>Wnt5a </italic>showed a different pattern, with a caudal<sup>high </sup>to rostral<sup>low </sup>gradient. This was a step gradient rather than a smooth gradient, with changes in expression level coinciding with rhombomere boundaries. There was little or no expression in r2/r3 and r4, apart from the floor plate, higher levels in r5/6 and then increased expression caudally, including a dorsal stripe (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E</xref>).

This migration mode is more characteristic of other populations of hindbrain branchiomotor neurons, for example, trigeminal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Another subpopulation of FBM neurons was located in the centre of the floor plate in r4 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E, H</xref>). Some heterozygotes of both lines appeared normal, but in a few cases at E13.5 there were FBM neurons in rostral r5 that had diverged from the migratory stream, and the facial motor nucleus appeared less compact compared with wild-type embryos, occupying part of r5 as well as r6 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4I&#x02013;K</xref>). These observations suggest that the normal caudal migratory path of FBM neurons had been transformed into a lateral or medial migration route in the absence of either of these two PCP genes (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4G&#x02013;I</xref>). The aberrant lateral FBM migration is reminiscent of that seen in <italic>Hoxb1 </italic>mutants at early developmental stages (E11.5), in which mis-specification of the FBM population results in a 'default state' of lateral migration, characteristic of branchiomotor neurons at other axial levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].

A reduced number of FBM neurons could be observed migrating caudally, but many neurons also formed streams migrating laterally in r4 and r5. At E14.5 the FBM nucleus was well-formed in wild-type embryos and was located in r6 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5K</xref>). In <italic>Fz3 </italic>mutants, an FBM nucleus was present in r6, but it was strongly reduced in size (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5M</xref>).

Thus, in <italic>Fz3 </italic>mutants, FBM migration shows severe defects consistent with the involvement of Fz signalling in this system. Attenuation of this pathway leads to many FBM neurons following a lateral 'default' migration pathway, in the manner of other hindbrain branchiomotor neuron subpopulations.</p></sec><sec><title>JNK and ROCK kinases signal during FBM migration and are required for the attractant effects of Wnts</title><p>In order to dissect the signalling pathways involved in FBM migration, we applied pharmacological inhibitors of candidate molecules to the FBM migration assay.

JNK and ROCK inhibitors had modest effects in inhibiting lateral migration, though these effects were considerably less than those on FBM neurons' caudal migration (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3A, B</xref>). However, inhibition of MLCK produced effects that were more pronounced (45% of explants at grade 1) and equivalent to those on the FBM caudal migration (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3C</xref>). These data suggest that while MLCK plays a general role in cranial motor neuron migration, JNK and ROCK show specificity in functioning within the FBM caudal migration. As MLCK is a direct target of ROCK, this suggests that MLCK function in the dorsal migration might also be regulated by other upstream components. We also tested whether JNK and ROCK inhibitors blocked FBM neuron attraction by VEGF. Scoring of explants indicated that these inhibitors failed to block attraction by VEGF beads, indicating that JNK and ROCK are specific to Wnt-mediated FBM migration (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1C, D</xref>).</p><p>In view of the fact that Wnt5a is the most promising candidate to be an FBM chemoattractant <italic>in vivo</italic>, we next tested whether JNK or ROCK functioned downstream of Wnt5a, by applying inhibitors to explants containing implanted Wnt5a beads. The attractant effect of Wnt5a beads was specifically blocked by adding 10 &#x003bc;M of JNK inhibitor or of ROCK inhibitor (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6J, K</xref>). This effect was further quantified by pixel counting (Materials and methods) of the number of FBM neurons in r4 adjacent to Wnt5a beads alone or in the presence of inhibitors. This showed a significant reduction in the number of FBM neurons adjacent to Wnt beads when explants were treated with inhibitors compared with those containing Wnt5a beads alone (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1B</xref>). This suggests that the effect of Wnt5a in FBM migration is mediated by the JNK and ROCK kinases.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>We here propose that Wnt5a/7a act as guidance cues/chemoattractants in mammalian neuronal migration.

Although PCP components play a role in FBM migration in zebrafish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], no Wnt ligands have so far been linked with the migration (reviewed by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]). In the mouse, correlative data have showed that in <italic>Tbx20 </italic>mutant mice with aberrant FBM neuron migration, several Wnt/PCP components are down-regulated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. Our study provides functional data suggesting a role for Wnt signalling via a non-canonical pathway, probably involving PCP components, in mammalian FBM migration.</p><sec><title>Wnt5a/7a act as guidance cues/chemoattractants</title><p>In vertebrates, a role for Wnt5a in cell migration is indicated by the finding that down-regulation of Wnt5a impedes cell migration in a wound-healing assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. Our findings add to a growing body of evidence suggesting that the 'non-canonical Wnts', including Wnt5a, Wnt7a and Wnt11, function in aspects of PCP, including convergent extension movements (for example, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]), and cochlear hair cell orientation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Intriguingly, <italic>Wnt11 </italic>is also expressed in FBM neurons, and is absent in <italic>Tbx20 </italic>mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. It is possible, therefore, that several Wnts collaborate during the migration. We found that <italic>Wnt7a </italic>mutant mice had no deficit in FBM migration, whereas in <italic>Wnt5a </italic>mutants, the migration pattern and nuclear formation were impaired. The relatively weak phenotype in <italic>Wnt5a </italic>mutants, however, suggests that whereas Wnt5a plays an important role, Wnt7a and/or other Wnts might play an adjunct role. This idea has a parallel in studies demonstrating that Wnt7a and Wnt5a both pattern cochlear hair cell polarisation, but only <italic>Wnt5a </italic>mutants show cochlear defects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In our system the more uniform expression pattern of <italic>Wnt7a </italic>might not rule out a possible role in the migration, as in zebrafish, several other Wnt/PCP components that play a functional role in FBM migration are widely expressed in the hindbrain. Interestingly, in the zebrafish, no Wnt ligands have so far been linked to the FBM migration (reviewed by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]). It remains a formal possibility in the mouse hindbrain that, as has been suggested in other systems, activation of the PCP pathway might depend on a gradient of Fz activity without involving a Wnt ligand [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Previous studies on axon guidance in vertebrates have pointed to a role for Wnts in chemoattraction and chemorepulsion of commissural axons and corticospinal axons, respectively, along the rostrocaudal axis of the spinal cord [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. In both cases Wnts (4 and 1/5a) were proposed to be distributed in a rostral<sup>high </sup>to caudal<sup>low </sup>gradient, the opposite polarity to that of <italic>Wnt5a </italic>expression in the hindbrain. It is likely, therefore, that local differences in Wnt gradients along the rostrocaudal axis, coupled with utilisation of different receptors/receptor complexes, dictate different cellular responses. In our proposed model, it is possible that endogenous SFRPs also play a role; SFRP2 is expressed in r4 in the mouse E10.5 hindbrain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>], and might enhance the caudal to rostral Wnt gradient by sequestering Wnt rostrally.</p><p>Another reason for the relatively modest phenotype in <italic>Wnt5a </italic>mutants is likely to be the role played by VEGF in FBM migration. VEGF is expressed in the floor plate and in a lateral stripe in the mouse hindbrain at E12.5, as well as in a group of cells lateral to the FBM nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. VEGF acts as a chemoattractant when presented on beads in an explant FBM migration assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and the present study). VEGF and Wnt signalling are therefore likely to co-operate during the process of FBM migration. As Wnt5a is expressed in a rostro-caudal gradient and VEGF is expressed laterally, it may be that Wnts and VEGF play a role in the caudal and the lateral cell displacements, respectively. It is as yet unclear whether they utilise common signalling pathways; our experiments suggest that VEGF does not act via the JNK and ROCK kinases</p></sec><sec><title>The PCP pathway is implicated downstream of Wnts</title><p>The striking phenotypes of <italic>Vangl2 </italic>and <italic>Scribble </italic>mutants, in which FBM migration is arrested, add to a growing body of evidence implicating Wnt/PCP components in FBM migration (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A, B</xref>).

In <italic>Fz3 </italic>mutants, as in <italic>Vangl2 </italic>and <italic>Scribble </italic>mutants, the majority of FBM neurons migrated laterally (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7A</xref>). <italic>Fz3 </italic>is globally expressed in the mouse hindbrain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>], and in zebrafish, <italic>Fz3a </italic>has been shown to act non-cell autonomously to control FBM migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Although we cannot distinguish between a cell autonomous or non-cell autonomous mechanism of action of Fz3 in our system, the two mechanisms may not be mutually exclusive. Fz3 might function in chemoattraction of FBM neurons in a cell-autonomous manner, but a Fz activity gradient in the neuroepithelium might also play a role. This would not exclude the possibility that other Fzs might be involved. Fz4 and Fz7 can interact with Wnt5a, and Fz7 is expressed by FBM neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>]. Other studies link the alternative Wnt receptor Ror2 to Wnt5a-induced cell migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B56">56</xref>]. The possibility of an association between Fz and Vangl2 is also suggested by the observation that a multi-PDZ containing protein, MAGI-3, can bind Fz4 and Fz7 and Vangl2, providing the basis of a receptor complex for JNK signalling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>JNK and ROCK kinases play a role in FBM migration</title><p>Our investigation of downstream signalling in FBM migration by the use of inhibitors revealed a most striking role for JNK, both in the migration <italic>per se</italic>, and in the deflection of FBM neurons by the presentation of ectopic Wnt5a protein on beads. ROCK inhibition had a less striking effect on the migration pattern, but could also block the Wnt5a effect. Inhibition of MLCK disrupted FBM migration equivalently to ROCK inhibition, but also inhibited the dorsal migration of other hindbrain branchiomotor neurons, suggesting that it does not function specifically in the rostrocaudal migration route. Both JNK and ROCK are well-known to function downstream in the PCP pathway (reviewed by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]; see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7B</xref> for schema). Wnt5a and the PCP pathway have also been linked to both JNK and ROCK in convergent extension movements in fish and frogs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>]. However, in mammals, PCP downstream signalling pathways have been less clear. Whereas Wnt5a activates JNK in cultured mammalian cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>], a study focussing on convergent extension in the mouse found a role for RhoA-ROCK, but not JNK, downstream of Vangl2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>We cannot completely rule out the possibility that JNK and ROCK function independently of the PCP pathway in our system. However, on balance, our findings suggest that both JNK and ROCK are important effectors of Wnt5a signalling in FBM neurons. By contrast, MLCK may play a role as a common target for several signalling pathways involved in the migration of branchiomotor (including FBM) neurons. A major target of MLCK is myosin II, which localises to the rear of the nucleus during neuronal migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>]; mice mutant for <italic>myosin IIB </italic>show defective facial motor nucleus formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>], consistent with our MLCK inhibitor studies. The downstream targets of JNK and ROCK phosphorylation in FBM neurons are unknown. Promising candidates are microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs); for example, known targets of JNK are the MAPs MAP1B and doublecortin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>].</p><p>Finally, it will be intriguing for future studies to discover whether Wnt5a or other Wnts orchestrate neuronal migrations or axon projection patterns along the rostrocaudal axis of the hindbrain.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this paper we demonstrate that the Wnt/PCP pathway functions in mammalian FBM migration via an attractant mechanism. Both <italic>Wnts </italic>are expressed in the hindbrain, and <italic>Wnt5a </italic>is expressed in a rostral<sup>low </sup>to caudal<sup>high </sup>gradient consistent with a chemoattractant role. An <italic>in vivo </italic>role for Wnts is suggested by the finding that attenuation of endogenous Wnt signalling using SFRPs, or by genetic loss of function of <italic>Wnt5a</italic>, disrupts the FBM migration. Genetic deletion of the Wnt/PCP genes <italic>Fz3</italic>, <italic>Vangl2 </italic>and <italic>Scribble </italic>leads to severe disruption of FBM migration. We further show that the JNK and ROCK kinases are downstream components of Wnt signalling in FBM neurons. Our study is the first implicating Wnt/PCP signalling in mammalian FBM neuron migration.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>E: embryonic day; FBM: facial branchiomotor; Fz: Frizzled; JNK: c-Jun amino-terminal kinase; MAP: microtubule-associated protein; MLCK: myosin light chain kinase; PBS: phosphate-buffered saline; PBT: phosphate-buffered saline containing Triton-X100; PCP: planar cell polarity; r: rhombomere; ROCK: Rho kinase; Scrb: Scribble; Sema3A: Semaphorin 3A; SFRP: secreted frizzed-related protein; Vangl2: Van Gogh-like 2; VEGF: vascular endothelial growth factor.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>VV performed all the experiments reported in this paper and developed the concepts.
