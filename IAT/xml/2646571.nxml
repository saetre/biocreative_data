Interleukin (IL) 4 further induces Gfi-1, resulting in optimal Th2 cell expansion. We report a second important function of Gfi-1 in CD4 T cells: prevention of alternative differentiation by Th2 cells, and inhibition of differentiation of naive CD4 T cells to either Th17 or inducible regulatory T (iTreg) cells. In <italic>Gfi1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> Th2 cells, the <italic>Rorc</italic>, <italic>Il23r</italic>, and <italic>Cd103</italic> loci showed histone 3 lysine 4 trimethylation modifications that were lacking in wild-type Th2 cells, implying that Gfi-1 is critical for epigenetic regulation of Th17 and iTreg cell&#x02013;related genes in Th2 cells. Enforced Gfi-1 expression inhibited IL-17 production and iTreg cell differentiation. Furthermore, a key inducer of both Th17 and iTreg cell differentiation, transforming growth factor &#x003b2;, repressed Gfi-1 expression, implying a reciprocal negative regulation of CD4 T cell fate determination. Chromatin immunoprecipitation showed direct binding of the Gfi-1&#x02013;lysine-specific demethylase 1 repressive complex to the intergenic region of <italic>Il17a/Il17f</italic> loci and to intron 1 of <italic>Cd103</italic>. T cell&#x02013;specific <italic>Gfi1</italic> conditional knockout mice displayed a striking delay in the onset of experimental allergic encephalitis correlated with a dramatic increase of Foxp3<sup>+</sup>CD103<sup>+</sup> CD4 T cells. Thus, Gfi-1 plays a critical role both in enhancing Th2 cell expansion and in repressing induction of Th17 and CD103<sup>+</sup> iTreg cells.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Upon T cell activation, naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells can differentiate into distinct cell lineages, including the classical Th1 and Th2 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>), as well as the recently defined Th cells producing IL-17 (Th17 cells) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>) and inducible Treg (iTreg) cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>). These cells play important roles in adaptive immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref>). Th1 cells mainly produce IFN-&#x003b3; and are involved in immunity against intracellular pathogens. Th2 cells produce IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13, are involved in immunity against helminths and other extracellular parasites, and enhance antibody responses. Th17 cells produce IL-17a, IL-17f, IL-21, and IL-22, and are critical for immunity against extracellular bacteria and fungi. Th1, Th2, and Th17 cells are also involved in the induction or maintenance of autoimmune and immunopathologic diseases. Thus, Th1 and Th17 cells are linked to many organ-specific autoimmune diseases, and Th2 cells play critical roles in asthma and other allergic diseases. iTreg cells, functionally similar to naturally occurring Treg cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>), can regulate immune responses. Among naturally occurring Treg cells, a subset expressing CD103 has been reported to contain the highest suppressive activity and to be present in the mucosal tissues, such as in the gut, as well as at sites of inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>). Interestingly, a large number of CD4 cells differentiated in the presence of TGF-&#x003b2; in vitro express CD103 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>), and TGF-&#x003b2; has been shown to induce Treg cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>).</p><p>The cytokine milieu during CD4 T cell activation is one of the most important factors in determining T cell fate. IL-12 and IFN-&#x003b3; induce Th1 cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>); IL-4 and IL-2 induce Th2 cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>), TGF-&#x003b2; and IL-6/IL-21 induce Th17 cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>), and TGF-&#x003b2; and IL-2 induce iTreg cell generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>). Although several transcription factors are involved in the differentiation and maintenance of each Th cell type, Th cell differentiation is mainly controlled by specific master transcription factors and Stat family members: T-bet and Stat4 for Th1 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>), GATA-3 and Stat5 for Th2 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>), ROR&#x003b3;t and Stat3 for Th17 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>), and Foxp3 and Stat5 for Treg cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>).</p><p>Growth factor independent 1 (Gfi-1), a transcriptional repressor, was initially reported as a protooncogene that allows an IL-2&#x02013;dependent cell line to be IL-2 independent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>). Gfi-1 was also found as a common insertion site in Moloney murine leukemia virus&#x02013;induced T lymphomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>). During Th2 cell differentiation, the expression levels of GATA-3 are enhanced as a result of TCR-mediated signaling and/or activation of the IL-4&#x02013;Stat6 pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>). In collaboration with Stat5, activated by IL-2, GATA-3 induces remodeling of the <italic>Il4</italic> locus and the capacity to produce IL-4 when cells are stimulated through TCRs. Gfi-1 is transiently induced by TCR stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>). Its expression is further enhanced and prolonged by IL-4, resulting in optimal Th2 cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>). Gfi-1 selects GATA-3<sup>hi</sup> cells to grow in IL-2, suggesting that there is a selective component involving Gfi-1 in Th2 cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>).</p><p>Three groups, including ours, have generated germline <italic>Gfi1</italic> KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>). Many abnormalities have been observed, including neutropenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>), a T cell development defect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref>), a hematopoietic stem cell defect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref>), and defects in dendritic cell development and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref>). The profound defect in T cell development in <italic>Gfi1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> mice is associated with a large proportion of their peripheral CD4 T cells displaying memory-like phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>), presumably as a result of lymphopenia-driven cell proliferation and differentiation.</p><p>To analyze the role played by Gfi-1 in the differentiation and/or growth of normal CD4 T cells, we generated <italic>Gfi1</italic> conditional KO (<italic>Gfi1</italic> cKO) mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref>) in which Gfi-1 is deleted only in T cells. Th2 cells differentiated from <italic>Gfi1</italic> cKO mice have a severe defect in cell expansion. In vivo, the Th2 response is dramatically impaired in these KO mice. On the other hand, IFN-&#x003b3; production is enhanced in the absence of Gfi-1, raising the possibility that Gfi-1 may negatively regulate the differentiation of other Th cell lineages. We report that Gfi-1 suppresses both Th17 and CD103<sup>+</sup> iTreg cell differentiation, whereas TGF-&#x003b2;, critical for Th17 and iTreg cell induction, down-regulates Gfi-1 expression. In the absence of Gfi-1, Foxp3<sup>+</sup>CD103<sup>+</sup> Treg cells are preferentially expanded in vivo upon immunization.</p><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Th2 cells lacking <italic>Gfi1</italic> display an active genomic configuration at the <italic>Cd103</italic>, <italic>Rorc</italic>, and <italic>Il23r</italic> loci</title><p>Th2 cells differentiated from <italic>Gfi1</italic> cKO (<italic>Gfi1<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>-CD4Cre) mice have a severe defect in cell expansion and also produce some IFN-&#x003b3;, suggesting that Gfi-1 is important for sustaining the Th2 cell phenotype. A recent report suggests that Gfi-1, as a transcriptional repressor, is associated with the histone lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1), which results in demethylation of histone 3 lysine 4 (H3K4) at target promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref>). LSD1 demethylates mono- and dimethylation but not trimethylation of H3K4. However, because of the balance of different methylation states, active gene promoter regions usually contain higher levels of H3K4 trimethylation than of mono- and dimethylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref>). To search for Gfi-1 target genes in T cells, the chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)&#x02013;Seq technology was applied. We used H3K4 trimethylation, the end product of H3K4 methylation, as an indicator, reasoning that such modification would not accumulate in <italic>Gfi1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> cells at Gfi-1 target sites because of a lack of the mono- or dimethylated forms of H3K4. As expected, both wild-type and <italic>Gfi1</italic> cKO Th2 cells displayed a similar pattern of H3K4 trimethylation at the <italic>Gata3</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 A</xref>).1 Because H3K4 methylation is associated with active chromatin, this indicates that Gfi-1, although important for Th2 expansion, is not essential for the Th2 polarization process. Interestingly, at the <italic>Cd103</italic> locus, whose expression is associated with a subset of Treg cells, <italic>Gfi1</italic> cKO Th2 cells showed high levels of H3K4 modification that was absent in wild-type Th2 or Th17 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 B</xref>). At the <italic>Rorc</italic> locus, which encodes ROR&#x003b3;t, critical for Th17 cell differentiation, <italic>Gfi1</italic> cKO Th2 cells displayed levels of H3K4 modification similar to Th17 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 C</xref>). H3K4 modification was also detected at the <italic>Il23r</italic> locus in <italic>Gfi1</italic> cKO Th2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1 D</xref>). Such a modification was absent in wild-type Th2 cells. <italic>Gfi1</italic> cKO Th2 cells did not appear to be contaminated with Th17 cells, because H3K4 trimethylation at the <italic>Il21</italic> and <italic>Il17f</italic> loci was not observed the <italic>Gfi1</italic> cKO Th2 cells, although it was prominent in Th17 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1, E and F</xref>). These results indicate that Gfi-1 plays an important role in chromatin remodeling of Th17 and iTreg cell&#x02013;related genes, including <italic>Rorc, Il23r</italic>, and <italic>Cd103</italic>, in Th2 cells. Although <italic>Gfi1</italic> cKO Th2 cells displayed an active <italic>Rorc</italic> locus, expression of ROR&#x003b3;t in <italic>Gfi1</italic> cKO Th2 cells is much lower than that in Th17 cells (unpublished data), indicating that additional factors, possibly induced by TGF-&#x003b2; and IL-6, are required for <italic>Rorc</italic> expression as well as for the induction of IL-17.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Abnormal histone H3K4 trimethylation at the <italic>Cd103</italic>, <italic>Rorc</italic>, and <italic>Il23r</italic> loci in <italic>Gfi1</italic> cKO Th2 cells.</bold> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from naive wild-type or <italic>Gfi1</italic> cKO mice were activated under Th2 or Th17 conditions for 4 d.

In the wild-type group, 24.5% of the cells from the culture restimulated under Th2 conditions produced IL-4, whereas, only 8% of the cells that were switched from Th2 to Th17 conditions produced IL-4, implying that TGF-&#x003b2; suppresses IL-4 production in differentiated Th2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2 A</xref>). Nevertheless, neither cell population was capable of producing IL-17, suggesting that TGF-&#x003b2; and/or IL-6 is not effective in inducing IL-17 production in differentiated Th2 cells. In contrast, in the <italic>Gfi1</italic> cKO group, although IL-4 production was also reduced (from 16.3 to 5.6%) when cells were switched from Th2 to Th17 conditions, 8.2% of the switched cells were capable of making IL-17.

Consistent with the intracellular staining results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 A</xref>, both IL-17a and IL-17f mRNA levels were reduced by enforced expression of Gfi-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 B</xref>). Enforced Gfi-1 expression in <italic>Gfi1</italic> cKO Th17 cells also suppressed IL-17a but not ROR&#x003b3;t expression (Fig. S2). Suppression of IL-17 requires the Gfi-1 suppressive domain, because Gfi-1 bearing a single mutation in this domain (Gfi-1(P2A)) failed to suppress IL-17 production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig. 4 C</xref>).</p><p>The failure of Gfi-1 to suppress ROR&#x003b3;t transcription in this setting is apparently at odds with the genomic data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1</xref>, in which the <italic>Rorc</italic> locus is not H3K4 trimethylated in wild-type Th2 cells but is trimethylated in <italic>Gfi1</italic> cKO Th2 cells. However, this discrepancy may be explained by the fact that retroviral-mediated expression of Gfi-1 does not occur until 24&#x02013;48 h after infection, whereas ROR&#x003b3;t up-regulation by TGF-&#x003b2; occurred within 24 h (unpublished data). Alternatively, Gfi-1 may require another Th2 factor as a cosuppressor of ROR&#x003b3;t transcription. Nevertheless, the data indicate that Gfi-1 suppresses IL-17 even when ROR&#x003b3;t is normally expressed.</p><p>To test the direct binding of Gfi-1 to its putative target genes, ChIP using anti&#x02013;Gfi-1 antibody was performed. The Gfi-1 DNA binding sites contain AATC, and sequences containing AAATCNNNG are represented at the highest frequency in a random oligonucleotide selection assay, suggesting that such sequences may have particularly high binding affinity for Gfi-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">51</xref>). Eight putative Gfi-1 binding sites containing AAATCNNNG or its complement CNNNGATTT, including the Rorc promoter (Rorcp) from the <italic>Rorc</italic> locus and nine sites from the <italic>Il17a/Il17f</italic> loci along with <italic>Gfi1</italic> promoter (Gfi1p) as a positive control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">52</xref>), were tested for Gfi-1 binding.

These data indicate that endogenous expression of Gfi-1 in Th17 cells, even at low levels, is sufficient to modulate IL-17 production.

As expected, 13&#x02013;14 d after MOG immunization, wild-type mice began to develop clinical symptoms, with a peak in intensity at 3 wk. The onset of disease in <italic>Gfi1</italic> cKO mice was significantly delayed, by approximately 1 wk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 A</xref>). IL-17 has been reported as a key player in the induction of the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">53</xref>). IL-17a mRNA in CD4 T cells was measured by real-time PCR before or after various times of immunization without in vitro restimulation. There was an approximately twofold increase of IL-17a mRNA in <italic>Gfi1</italic> cKO mice at all time points after MOG immunization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 B</xref>). Neither IFN-&#x003b3; nor IL-4 mRNA was found to be consistently different from the levels in wild-type mice, possibly because of the modest Th1 or Th2 responses of these mice to immunization. CD103 mRNA is higher in <italic>Gfi1</italic> cKO CD4 cells before immunization, consistent with the staining data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5 D</xref>, and was further increased after MOG immunization. Ex vivo restimulation of CD4 T cells 1 wk after immunization followed by anti&#x02013;IL-17 intracellular staining confirmed the enhancement of IL-17 production in <italic>Gfi1</italic> cKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 C</xref>). However, intracellular staining of IL-17&#x02013;producing cells 3 wk after immunization revealed no difference between wild-type and <italic>Gfi1</italic> cKO CD4 T cells (unpublished data). The discrepancy between IL-17 mRNA and IL-17 protein at 3 wk after immunization may result from the very strong stimulus used for restimulation. Nevertheless, the data certainly indicate that there was no defect in the generation and expansion of Th17 cells in <italic>Gfi1</italic> cKO mice. Flow cytometry analysis showed a continuous increase of Foxp3<sup>+</sup> cells in <italic>Gfi1</italic> cKO mice after immunization, which peaked at 3 wk (39.1 and 38.5% in <italic>Gfi1</italic> cKO mice compared with 22.8 and 20.5% in wild-type mice; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6 D</xref>). Although CD103<sup>+</sup> Treg cells were already high in <italic>Gfi1</italic> cKO mice before immunization, there was a substantial increase of such cells after immunization (26.1 and 28.9% in <italic>Gfi1</italic> cKO mice vs. 6% and 3.7% in wild-type mice), suggesting that Gfi-1 normally plays a negative role in the expansion of Treg cells in vivo. No apparent lymphocyte infiltration into the central nervous system (CNS) was found in healthy mice from either group after immunization. However, among the sick mice, Foxp3<sup>+</sup> cells were more abundant in the CNS of the <italic>Gfi1</italic> cKO mice than of the wild-type mice (Fig. S3 A, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081666/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081666/DC1</ext-link>).

Th1 cells from <italic>Gfi1</italic> cKO mice expand normally but make more IFN-&#x003b3; than WT Th1 cells. In addition, <italic>Gfi1</italic> cKO Th2 cells display a different pattern of chromatin histone modification than wild-type Th2 cells. These observations led us to reassess the function of Gfi-1 during T cell differentiation, particularly because two new Th lineages, Th17 and iTreg cells, have been recently defined. In this paper, we showed that Gfi-1 is down-regulated by TGF-&#x003b2; stimulation during Th17 and iTreg cell&#x02013;inducing conditions, and enforced expression of Gfi-1 inhibits both Th17 and iTreg cell differentiation.

Gfi-1 and its congener Gfi-1b have been recently reported to associate with the histone demethylase LSD1 and CoREST to form a repressive complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref>). Gfi-1 directs the complex to the promoter of target genes where LSD1 can demethylate H3K4 residues and thus repress transcription. Knockdown of LSD1 in erythroid cells leads to increased H3K4 dimethylation and trimethylation of Gfi-1b targets. In this paper, we showed that <italic>Il17a/Il17f</italic> and <italic>Cd103</italic> are the targets for Gfi-1 in T cells. Furthermore, LSD1 is recruited to those sites in a Gfi-1&#x02013;dependent manner.</p><p>The <italic>Rorc</italic> and <italic>Il23r</italic> promoter regions are heavily methylated on H3K4 residues in <italic>Gfi1</italic> cKO Th2 cells but not in WT Th2 cells; methylation levels are comparable to those found in WT Th17 cells. However, we were not able to locate Gfi-1 binding sites within the <italic>Rorc</italic> or <italic>Il23r</italic> loci, suggesting that they may not be the direct targets of Gfi-1. A future goal will be to understand the mechanism through which Gfi-1 regulates the chromatin modification at the <italic>Rorc</italic> and <italic>Il23r</italic> loci. ROR&#x003b3;t is also expressed in the cells cultured under iTreg cell&#x02013;inducing conditions, correlating with the H3K4 methylation in such cells, although iTreg cells fail to express IL-17 (unpublished data). These results indicate that ROR&#x003b3;t can be up-regulated by TGF-&#x003b2; alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref>) and that down-regulation of Gfi-1 by TGF-&#x003b2; is critical for ROR&#x003b3;t expression during Th17 cell differentiation.</p><p>In a model of EAE involving immunization with MOG, the percentage of IL-17&#x02013;producing cells found in <italic>Gfi1</italic> cKO mice was modestly higher than in wild-type controls.

Thus, similar to our in vitro results, the optimal appearance of IL-17&#x02013;producing cells induced by TGF-&#x003b2; in vivo requires down-regulation of Gfi-1 expression, which is transiently induced by T cell activation and/or IL-4 stimulation.</p><p>Gfi-1 expression is also down-regulated by TGF-&#x003b2; during iTreg cell differentiation, and enforced expression of Gfi-1 partially suppresses the induction of Foxp3<sup>+</sup>IL-2<sup>&#x02212;</sup> Treg cells. By down-regulating Gfi-1, Treg cells become more active and also display a tissue-seeking phenotype. In <italic>Gfi1</italic> cKO mice, the proportion of Foxp3<sup>+</sup>CD103<sup>+</sup> effector/memory Treg cells is already high, but this population is further increased after MOG immunization. In addition, Foxp3<sup>+</sup>CD103<sup>+</sup> are also expanded during <italic>T. gondii</italic> infection or in response to <italic>S. mansoni</italic> egg injection (Fig. S4, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081666/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20081666/DC1</ext-link>). We have not yet determined whether the increased percentage of Foxp3<sup>+</sup>CD103<sup>+</sup> cells in the <italic>Gfi1</italic> cKO mice and the expansion of this subset after immunization reflects a unique role for Gfi-1 in the development of Foxp3<sup>+</sup>CD103<sup>+</sup> thymic-derived Foxp3<sup>+</sup> T cells, or whether the higher percentage of Foxp3<sup>+</sup>CD103<sup>+</sup> T cells is secondary to an increased contribution of peripherally generated Foxp3<sup>+</sup>CD103<sup>+</sup> in the cKO mice that is further potentiated after immunization. In normal mice, the Foxp3<sup>+</sup>CD103<sup>+</sup> cell population is actively cycling and contains a high proportion of apoptotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>), so it remains possible that Gfi-1 may play a role in the homeostasis of this subset.</p><p>A selective effect of Gfi-1 on Treg cells with a modest effect on Th17 cell differentiation in vivo could be explained by the differential requirement of TGF-&#x003b2; in the induction of these two lineages. A low concentration of TGF-&#x003b2; is sufficient for Th17 cell differentiation, whereas iTreg cell differentiation requires a higher concentration of TGF-&#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">54</xref>). In the absence of Gfi-1, Treg cell numbers may increase in response to levels of TGF-&#x003b2; that normally only induce Th17 cell differentiation in wild-type mice after MOG immunization.</p><p>The selective expansion of the Foxp3<sup>+</sup>CD103<sup>+</sup> cells correlates with delayed EAE onset. Treg cells have been suggested to suppress autoimmune diseases by several mechanisms: by suppressing the activation and expansion of the effector cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>); by suppressing functions of effector cells, such as cytokine production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">55</xref>); and by limiting recruitment of effector cells to sites of inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">56</xref>). In our model, the disease onset was delayed in the <italic>Gfi1</italic> cKO mice, yet the number of effector cells that are capable of making IL-17 was not only not reduced but was modestly increased. Thus, it is most likely that the Foxp3<sup>+</sup>CD103<sup>+</sup> cells suppress disease by affecting recruitment and/or activation of the effector cells at inflammation sites consistent with the tissue-seeking phenotype of the Foxp3<sup>+</sup>CD103<sup>+</sup> T cells that are increased in frequency in <italic>Gfi1</italic> cKO mice. The majority of Treg cells found in the CNS are Foxp3<sup>+</sup>CD103<sup>+</sup>, even in wild-type mice. In addition, Treg cells are a much larger proportion of CNS CD4 T cells in <italic>Gfi1</italic> cKO than in wild-type mice.</p><p>Given the dual effects of Gfi-1 on effector and Treg cells, modulation of its expression and function could have opposite effects depending on the timing, location, and cell type in which it is expressed, just as is the case with the administration of TGF-&#x003b2; or anti&#x02013;TGF-&#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">57</xref>). However, blockade of Gfi-1 function during early stages of autoimmune diseases may be beneficial through the resultant expansion of Treg cells. Likewise, the specific targeting of Gfi-1 in Treg cells may enhance their migration to sites of inflammation as well as increase their suppressive activity.
