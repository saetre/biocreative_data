Angiopoietins 1 and 2 (Ang1 and Ang2) are regulators of both angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis through the Tek/Tie-2 receptor tyrosine kinase. The response of endothelial cells to stimulation with either Ang1 or Ang2 is thought to be dependent upon the origin of the endothelial cells. In this study, we examined the effects of the angiopoietins on lymphatic, venous and arterial primary endothelial cells (bmLEC, bmVEC and bmAEC, respectively), which were isolated and cultured from bovine mesenteric vessels.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>BmLEC, bmVEC and bmAEC cell populations all express Tie-2 and were shown to express the appropriate cellular markers Prox-1, VEGFR3, and Neuropilin-1 that define the particular origin of each preparation. We showed that while bmLECs responded slightly more readily to angiopoietin-2 (Ang2) stimulation, bmVECs and bmAECs were more sensitive to Ang1 stimulation. Furthermore, exposure of bmLECs to Ang2 induced marginally higher levels of proliferation and survival than did exposure to Ang1. However, exposure to Ang1 resulted in higher levels of migration in bmLECs than did to Ang2.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our results suggest that although both Ang1 and Ang2 can activate the Tie-2 receptor in bmLECs, Ang1 and Ang2 may have distinct roles in mesenteric lymphatic endothelial cells.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Tek or Tie-2 is the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) for the angiopoietin family of ligands (Ang1, 2, 3, and 4). The role of Tie-2 in endothelial cells has been extensively studied over the years, and the discovery of impaired lymphatic vessel patterning and function in Angiopoietin-2 (Ang2) knockout mice has since added extra complexity to this growing field [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Tie-2 has also been shown to be expressed in lymphatic endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. In vivo studies using slow-release pellets of an engineered form of Ang1, cartilage oligomeric matrix protein-Angiopoietin-1 (COMP-Ang1), have further showed induction of angiogenesis and ectopic lymphangiogenesis in mouse cornea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. In addition, over-expression of Ang1 in the skin of mouse ears via recombinant adeno-associated virus gene delivery induced lymphatic endothelial cell proliferation, lymphatic vessel enlargement, sprouting, and branching [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Prior to the discovery of the involvement of Tie-2 and its ligands in lymphangiogenesis, the role of Tie-2 and it ligands in angiogenesis was the focus of mouse genetic studies. Ang1 deficient mice exhibited phenotypes similar to those of Tie-2 knockout mice. These phenotypes included impaired myocardial trabeculation and endocardial development as well as lack of perivascular recruitment to endothelial cells undergoing angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Ang2 was initially characterized as an Ang1 competitive antagonist since transgenic over-expression of Ang2 produced angiogenic defects resembling those of Ang1 or Tie-2 knockout mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>In recent studies, evidence suggesting condition-dependent agonistic roles for Ang2 brought into question the initial characterization of Ang2 as simply a competitive antagonist of Ang1. Ang2 has been shown to activate Tie-2 phosphorylation at high concentrations leading to cell survival via the Akt signalling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Following a 24-hour pre-treatment, Ang2 can lead to vessel growth in a fibrin matrix model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Ang2 can also induce tubule formation in murine brain capillaries and promote endothelial cell migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In addition to inhibiting JNK/SAPK phosphorylation, Ang2 has been shown to induce phosphorylation of Tie-2, AKT, Erk1/2, and p38 members of the mitogen activated protein kinases in the human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Other functions of Ang2 in vasculogenesis include promotion of endothelial cell (EC) adhesion independently of Tie-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], regulation of differentiation of cells surrounding the cortical peritubular capillaries of the kidneys [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], and modulation of retinal and hyaloid blood vessel remodelling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>Complementing these studies were mouse knockout experiments that further elucidated the impotance of Ang2 in endothelial cell function. Ang2-null mice (strain 129/J) exhibited defects in the hyaloid blood vasculature and gross defects in lymphatic remodelling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Skin oedema in Ang2-null mice correlated with improper recruitment of support cells such as smooth muscle cells responsible for the contractile function of lymphangions in peripheral or dermal lymphatic vessels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The Ang2-null mice also developed lethal chylous ascites and edema in the peritoneal cavity around day 14, correlating with improperly remodelled lacteals in villi, disorganization and hypoplasia of intestinal lymphatic capillaries, and deficient smooth muscle association in mesenteric-collecting lymphatic vessels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The function of Ang2 is therefore not limited to antagonistic regulation of Ang1 in Tie-2 signalling.</p><p>In this study, we demonstrate that bovine mesenteric venous, arterial, and lymphatic endothelial cells (bmVEC, bmAEC, and bmLEC) responded differentially to Ang1 and Ang2. Firstly, both Ang1 and Ang2 activated Tie-2 and downstream ERK1/2 in bmLEC. However, whereas Ang1 promoted migration in bmLECs, Ang2 slightly more effectively promoted proliferation and survival in these cells. Secondly, Ang1 more effectively activated Tie-2 and downstream ERK1/2 in bmVECs and bmAECs than did Ang2. However, whereas Ang1 promoted survival, and migration in bmVECs and bmAECs, Ang2 did not stimulate the same responses in these cells. Whereas Ang1 produced a small proliferative response in bmAECs, neither Ang1 nor Ang2 produced a proliferative response in bmVECs. Taken together, our results suggest cellular responses to Ang1 and Ang2 stimulation vary depending on the origin of the endothelial cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>BmLEC isolation and culture</title><p>In order to distinguish translucent lymphatic vessels from surrounding fatty tissue, Evan's blue dye was injected into exposed mesenteric lymph nodes. The blue staining of post-nodal lymphatic vessels facilitated excision and processing of the vessels to extract endothelial cells. Blood vessels remained red after dye injection (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>) and therefore could not be mistaken for lymphatic vessels. Initial cultures of cells extracted from dispase- and collagenase-treated excised bovine mesentery lymphatic vessels were at least 50% endothelial based on cellular morphology. Cells cultured from treated vessels were a mixture of smooth muscle cells (SMCs), fibroblasts, and cobblestoned bmLECs.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Isolation of Bovine Mesenteric Lymphatic Endothelial Cells</bold>.

The morphologies of the different cells within the mixed population were visually distinguishable. A mixed population of predominantly SMCs, fibroblasts, and a few bmLECs formed circular "swirly" patterns (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). This morphology has previously been described by Leak and Jones, and Johnston and Walker [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Populations of cells that predominantly consisted of fibroblasts (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>) or SMCs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1E</xref>) had distinct morphologies unlike the cobblestoned appearance of bmLEC at confluency (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1F</xref>).</p><p>To obtain purity greater than 90%, contaminating SMCs and fibroblasts were eliminated from the culture by direct aspiration, differential trypsinization, and by limited dilution. Resulting cultures of the primary cells bmLECs had doubling times of approximately 24 hours [see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>], consistent with doubling times reported by Leak and Jones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. These bmLECs were robust and could be frozen and thawed within 20 passages.</p><p>Previously, Leak and Jones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] described the spontaneous formation of lymphatic tube structures <italic>in vitro </italic>from confluent monolayer of lymphatic endothelial cells. We also observed the formation of these tubes in 96-well plates of bmLEC cell populations left at confluency for at least a few weeks (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1H</xref>). Cells at the ends of the tubes attached to and migrated up the sidewalls of the tissue culture wells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1G</xref>). The formation of lymphatic tubular structures in culture indicated that extracted bmLECs maintain lymphatic phenotypic character.</p></sec><sec><title>Comparing bmLECs to bmVECs, and to bmAECs</title><p>In essence, the strategy used to isolate bmLECs was also used to isolate bmAECs and bmVECs. Dye injection was unnecessary since large mesenteric arteries and veins were discernable from surrounding fatty tissue, unlike milky white lymphatic vessels. Arteries were thick-walled vessels that were easily distinguished from slightly larger and thin-walled veins. Cultured bmLECs, bmVECs, and bmAECs exhibited the same cobblestoned monolayer morphology at confluency (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>), although the packing of cells together was somewhat different. After the formation of the confluent monolayer, bmAECs, bmVECs, and bmLECs continued to grow at different rates to form tighter-packed monolayer [see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>]. BmAECs grew fastest at this stage and formed the densest monolayer. BmAECs were followed by bmVECs, which formed the second densest monolayer. BmLECs grew at the slowest rate at this stage and formed the least dense monolayer [see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref> and data not shown].</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Similarities and differences between bmLECs, bmVECs and bmAECs</bold>. A/ BmLECs could not be distinguished from bmVECs or bmAECs by cellular morphology alone. Actin staining of the three cells using Rhodamine-phalloidin showed actin filaments arranged in dense bands around the cell periphery and actin stress fibers extending throughout the cytoplasm. B/ Despite being similar in morphology, RT-PCR analysis showed bmLECs and not bmVECs or bmAECs expressed Prox-1 and VEGR-3; bmAECs and not bmVECs expressed neuropilin-1.

However there seemed to be some qualitative differences in the intracellular distribution of these actin filaments. There were extensive dense peripheral bands of actin, with relatively few stress fibers in bmVECs, whereas stress fibers were more prominent in bmAECs. In contrast, bmLECs seemed to have an intermediate combination of both actin filament arrangements (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>).</p><p>Upon achieving confluency, apart from differences in cell packing, bmLECs were indistinguishable from bmVECs and bmAECs by phase contrast microscopy alone (data not shown). However, using gene-specific primers and reverse transcriptase-PCR analysis, and using antibodies specific for Prox-1, LYVE-1, or Podoplanin and immunofluorescence, we were able to demonstrate that these endothelial cell preparations retained their lineage-specific properties in culture. All three cell preparations expressed Tie-1 and Tie-2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>), whereas bmLECs but not blood ECs expressed VEGFR-3 (Flt-4) and Prox-1 (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). Immunofluorescence also showed bmLECs to express LYVE-1 and Podoplanin (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>), both of which have been shown to be specific markers of lymphatic endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Furthermore, bmAECs and not bmVECs expressed neuropilin-1, which has been shown to be a specific arterial endothelial cell marker [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Activation of Tie-2 in bmECs by Ang2</title><p>In order to ensure Tie-2 in bovine cells is sufficiently similar to human Tie-2 to be stimulated with human angiopoietin ligands, amino acid sequences of bovine, mouse, and human Tie-2 were aligned with CLUSTALW [see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>]. Protein sequence alignment of human, mouse and bovine Tie-2 indicated 95% identity between bovine and human sequences and 92% identity between mouse and human, or mouse and bovine sequences. More importantly, the residues found by Barton et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] to be important for the interaction of Tie-2 with Ang2 were conserved across the three species [see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>, blue boxes], and all tyrosine residues in the kinase domain were perfectly conserved [see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>]. Based on this observation, bovine endothelial cells should be highly suitable for stimulation with human ligands.</p><p>The Tie-2 receptor protein levels were greatest in bmAECs, whereas the levels in bmVECs and bmLECs were lower (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>, anti-Tie-2 (33.1)). Once the differences in expression levels of Tie-2 in each cell were accounted for, activation of Tie-2 as judged by its autophosphorylation by Ang2, relative to basal autophosphorylation level (mock treatment), was highest in bmLECs, and was considerably lower in bmAECs and bmVECs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). Clustered Ang1, which we have previously demonstrated is the most potent form of Ang1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], stimulated the activation of Tie-2 in all three cell types above basal levels (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). Of note, the level of phosphorylation of Tie-2 due to Ang1 stimulation as compared to the level due to Ang2 stimulation was the same in bmLECs but different in bmAECs and bmVECs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Stimulation of Tie-2 phosphorylation in bmECs by Ang1 and Ang2</bold>.

In our endothelial cell system, whereas endogenous protein levels of ERK1/2 were not different in bmLECs, bmVECs and bmAECs, active phosphorylated ERK 1/2 (phospho-ERK) levels were quite different. Mock-treated bmVECs contained high amounts of phospho-ERK, whose levels increased slightly upon Ang1 stimulation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). Ang2 stimulation of bmVECs did not activate ERK1/2 according to phosphorylation levels of the protein (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). Although bmAECs had relative low basal levels of phospho-ERK in the mock-treated sample, these cells responded in a similar fashion as bmVECS to Ang1 stimulation. Phospho-ERK levels were increased above basal levels upon Ang1 stimulation, but not upon Ang2 stimulation in bmAECs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). In contrast to bmAECs and bmVECs, stimulation of bmLECs with either Ang1 or Ang2 resulted in an increase in phospho-ERK levels, although Ang1 seemed to provide a more potent signal (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>).</p><p>In order to ascertain whether the autophosphorylation of Tie-2 detected in these immunoblots reflected ligand-dependent activation of Tie-2 and not just phosphorylation by another kinase, we immunoblotted membranes from bmLECs stimulated with Ang2 with an activation-specific antibody directed to phosphotyrosine 992. Phosphorylation of tyrosine 992 has been shown to reflect activation of kinase activity in Tie-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Tie-2 was phosphorylated at this residue when bmLECs were stimulated with Ang2 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>), indicating that kinase activity of the tyrosine receptor was activated.</p></sec><sec><title>BmLEC proliferation is enhanced by Ang1 and Ang2</title><p>Blood vasculature endothelial proliferation in response to growth factors is considered a key angiogenic response.

To determine whether Ang1 and Ang2 had differential effects on the proliferation of different types of endothelial cells, we tested the levels of thymidine uptake of the three bmECs in the presence of Ang1 and Ang2 (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). Although the basal proliferative activity of each cell preparation was somewhat varied: highest in bmAECs, lower in bmVECs, and lowest in bmLECs (data not shown), the differential responses of the cells to these angiogenic factors relative to control levels was detectable. BmVECs did not respond to either Ang1 or Ang2, whereas bmAECs responded best to Ang1 stimulation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). In contrast, bmLECs responded to both Ang1 and Ang2 but best to Ang2-stimulation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>).

Using a modified Boyden chamber assay we tested the ability of Ang1 and Ang2 to drive migration of these three cell types.

Ang1 has previously been shown by numerous groups including ours to protect HUVEC from apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. However, a role for Ang2-mediated EC survival remains unclear. Results of some studies suggested that Ang2 counteracts the anti-apoptotic effects of Ang1 and leads to cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>].

To investigate the role of Ang2 in serum-deprivation-induced cell death, we tested the ability of Ang1 or Ang2 to promote cell survival on the three cell preparations. Ang1 protected bmVECs and bmAECs from cell death, whereas it had minimal effect on bmLECs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>). In contrast Ang2 had virtually no effect on bmVECs and a marginal effect on bmAECs (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>).

Together with results from survival and proliferation assays (Summarized in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>), these results further suggest that the origin of endothelial cells dramatically influences angiogenesis/lymphangiogenesis-related responses to either Ang1 or Ang2.</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>Survival of Ang1 and Ang2 stimulated bmECs</bold>.

We prepared ECs from lymphatic, venous and arterial vessels taken from bovine mesentery and subjected them to numerous angiogenesis-related <italic>in vitro </italic>assays. Our results demonstrate that the activation of Tie-2 by Ang2 stimulation was as effective as by Ang1 stimulation in bmLECs. In bmVECs and bmAECs, Ang1 stimulation was more effective than Ang2 in activating Tie-2 in bmVECs and bmAECs. The activation of Tie-2 in all three cell types by Ang1 or in bmLECs by Ang2 correlated with the activation of ERK1/2. Ang1 activated ERK1/2 in all three cell types, whereas Ang2 only activated ERK1/2 in bmLECs. Of note, Ang1 seemed to be a more potent activator of ERK1/2 than Ang2 in bmLECs. These results suggest ERK1/2 is a downstream signalling pathway of Tie2 in endothelial cells. Although Ang1 stimulation correlated with ERK1/2 activation in all three cells, Ang1 did not promote proliferation in all three cell types but only weakly in bmAECs and bmLECs (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Unlike bmVECs, both bmAECs and bmLECs had low levels of basal phosphorylated ERK1/2 levels in the mock samples. This finding suggests that the proliferative response of bmLECs to Ang-2 stimulation may not be solely under the regulation of ERK1/2 downstream of Tie-2. Complex cell-type specific mechanisms present in the endothelial cells suppress the proliferative signal from Ang1 in bmVECs, but promote the weak proliferative responses in bmLEC and bmAECs.</p><p>Likewise, additional cell-specific mechanisms may be present in blood endothelial cells that suppress the proliferative and survival signals from Ang2, but are present in lymphatic endothelial cells to promote the proliferative and survival signals from Ang2. This was implied by our findings that Ang2 was not a proliferative signal for bmAECs or bmVECs but only for bmLECs. Similarly, Ang2 did not strongly support serum-free survival of bmVECs and bmAECs but significantly promoted the survival of bmLECs (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Of note, the level of ERK1/2 activation stimulated by Ang2 in bmLECs was lower than the level stimulated by Ang1, which did not provide as potent a proliferative or survival signal as Ang2 in bmLECs. In summary, our data shows that endothelial cells of different origin have different sets of cellular responses to Ang1 and Ang2 stimulation, suggesting that Ang1 and Ang2 activate distinct sets of signalling molecules in the signalling cascades of endothelial cells of different origin. Thus, we recommend the consideration of Ang2 as a full agonist in endothelial cells of lymphatic origin, but a partial agonist in endothelial cells of blood origin. Since Ang1 and Ang2 also elicited slightly different responses from bmAECs and bmVECs in our study (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>), the subtype of endothelial cells of blood origin need to be taken into consideration in future studies of Ang1 and Ang2 signalling and function.</p><p>Until recently, Ang2 was thought to be an Ang1 competitive antagonist. This conclusion was made based on the finding that transgenic over-expression of Ang2 produced blood vasculature defects resembling those of Ang1 or Tie-2 knockout mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Ang2 competitively blocked activation of Tie-2 by Ang1 but Ang2 was equally as effective as Ang1 in activating Tie-2 phosphorylation in NIH 3T3 fibroblasts ectopically expressing Tie-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. This finding suggested that endothelial cells have additional components that allow functional discrimination between the two angiopoietin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Our findings clearly indicates that the additional components suggested by these initial studies of Ang2 are endothelial cell-type specific and may be responsible for the agonistic activities of Ang2 in lymphatic endothelial cells. Although there are some functional redundancies, each angiopoietin may be driving a distinct set of cellular events within a specific type of endothelial cell.</p><p>Ang2 induction has been shown to associate with progression and prognosis of a variety of human cancers. High expression of Ang2 in malignant tissue correlates with poor survival rate, and/or high frequency of metastasis, and/or high microvascular density (MVD) in patients with advanced colorectal carcinoma, breast cancer, gastric carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), prostate cancer, and ovarian cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. In contrast, expression of Ang1 in these tumours was often found to be at comparatively low to undetectable levels. These studies implicate Ang2 as a potentially potent target of anti-angiogenic cancer therapy. In fact, blocking Ang2 activity by antibodies and specific peptide inhibitors has been efficacious in suppressing tumour growth and reducing endothelial cell proliferation in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>].</p><p>This evidence suggests that Ang2 is not simply a "context-dependent antagonist/agonist" of Tie-2 signalling; Ang2 can also be a potentially effective candidate target of therapy for pathological conditions involving both angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis, such as cancer metastasis. Importantly, drug designs intended to target Ang2- while avoiding Ang1-mediated signalling may produce fewer side effects. This point lends justification to further intensive studies to characterize the cell-type specific mechanisms responsible for differential responsiveness to Ang1 and Ang2 stimulation in angiogenesis as well as in lymphangiogenesis. Cells systems such as the one described in this study would be useful tools in this endeavour.</p><p>Historically, the angiogenesis field has advanced faster and farther than that of lymphangiogenesis. The discovery of lymphatic markers and the emerging evidence implicating the lymphatic system's central role in a variety of pathological conditions has attracted research interest and driven the field forward. One important question emerges as researchers are confronted with the design of pharmaceuticals in enhancing or mitigating lymphangiogenesis: whether it is possible to specifically target one vascular system without adversely compromising the functions of other vascular system when there is evidence of shared molecular regulators such as the angiopoietins behaving differently in the two systems. Addressing this important question requires <italic>in vitro </italic>systems such as the one described here, that allows simultaneous characterization of the signalling pathways downstream of the angiopoietins in each of the three cell types: venous, arterial and lymphatic endothelial cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have isolated primary endothelial cells from lymphatic (bmLECs), vein (bmVECs), and arterial (bmAECs) vessels of bovine mesentery. The cells express specific markers of their respective lineages, and were used to test the hypothesis that endothelial cell type determined cellular response such as proliferation, migration, and survival to Ang1 and Ang2 stimulation. We found that indeed, while Ang1 was a chemoattractant for all three cells, Ang1 was a more potent survival signal than Ang2 in bmAEC and bmVEC. In contrast, Ang2 was a more potent survival and proliferative signal than Ang1 in bmLECs. Our data suggests that each endothelial cell type possesses a unique repertoire of signalling proteins that allows that cell type to differentially respond to the angiopoietins.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>bmLEC isolation and culture</title><p>Methods for isolation and culture of bovine endothelial cells were adapted from previously established methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].
