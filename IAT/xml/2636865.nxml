Sp3 over-expression strongly reduces the development of tumours in nude mice confirming its pro-apoptotic potential in vivo. However, cells can survive to apoptosis through selective Sp3 cleavage by caspase. Sp3 induction in established tumours resulted in transient regression then progression. Progression coincides with re-accumulation of the full length form of Sp3. Sp3 is over-expressed in tumour cell lines of different origins. The presence of high levels of the full-length form of Sp3 indicates a poor prognosis for overall survival of patients with head and neck tumours.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Full length Sp3 accumulation highlights bypass of tumour cell apoptotic capacities and is indicative of head and neck tumours aggressiveness.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Sp3 is a zinc finger transcription factor that belongs to the Sp transcription factor family comprising Sp1, 2 and 4.

Both cells were chosen in order to determine the effect of Sp3 over-expression in a normal and a tumour cell line. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004478-g001">Figure 1</xref> shows that exogenous Sp3 was induced by tetracycline stimulation in the different cell types.

Western blot experiments with an anti-Sp3 antibody showed that exogenous Sp3 was over-expressed compared to the endogenous form in both cell lines. Moreover, endogenous Sp3 was more highly expressed in LS174 than in R443 cells. Note that following over-expression, extra bands were detected at 60 and 35 kDa with both anti-Sp3 and anti-Myc antibodies.

We carefully addressed the apoptosis mechanisms by three independent methods: measurement of pan-caspase activity, evaluation of the number of fragmented nuclei and cleavage of caspase 9. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004478-g003">Figure 3A</xref> shows that induction of Sp3 resulted in increased pan-caspase activity. The specific pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK inhibits both basal and Sp3-dependent caspase activation which was stronger in LS174 cells (clone S27), probably reflecting the higher basal amounts of Sp3 in the absence of tetracycline. We have then more carefully addressed the apoptotic potential of Sp3 in the LS174 tumour cells. A quantitative analysis of fragmented nuclei upon Sp3 induction presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004478-g003">Figure 3B</xref> illustrates that more than 50&#x00025; cells were apoptotic following 72 hours of Sp3 induction and that the increased number of apoptotic cells paralleled the cleavage/activation of caspase 9 and PARP cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004478-g003">Figure 3C</xref>), two substrates for active caspase 3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004478-Fujita1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>.

Sp3 was more highly expressed in tumour than in normal cell lines (fibroblast, endothelial cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0004478-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). We then tried to extrapolate these results to human head and neck carcinomas (H&#x00026;N). As in colon cancer, H&#x00026;N tumours have mutations in ras and over-expression of EGF receptors leading to activation of the ERK pathway. We unsuccessfully tried to constitutively express Sp3 in H&#x00026;N tumour cells, suggesting that the pro-apototic potential of Sp3 is also efficient in these cells. Sp3 levels in 52 H&#x00026;N tumour samples were previously analysed by our team <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004478-Onesto1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>.

Moreover, patient age, tumour size and nodal status were also significantly correlated with overall survival (p&#x0003c;0.05) and serve as positive controls.

treatments. For this reason we analysed the relevance of the transcription factor Sp3 as an indicator of tumour aggressiveness. Our study was based on previous observations describing Sp1 as an indicator of poor prognosis for pancreatic cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004478-Shi1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. However, the Shi et al study was contradicted by the results of Deniaud et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004478-Deniaud1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, which showed that Sp1 over-expression induces apoptosis. Although it is over-expressed in tumour cells and tumour samples, Sp3 also induces apoptosis. One part of the puzzle has been elucidated since increased Sp3 expression seems progressive from benign to aggressive tumours <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004478-MertensTalcott1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. The present data have highlighted that accumulation of Sp3 is progressive all along the tumour process. This mechanism of adaptation apparently depends on a balance between reduced of Sp3 cleavage and increased Sp3 expression and/or stability. Hence, the presence of the full-length active form of Sp3 results in increased transcription of many genes related to tumour growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004478-Zhang1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref> and angiogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004478-Pages1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. The use of an inducible cellular system has allowed evaluation of the initiation of apoptosis related to Sp3 accumulation, a mechanism mimicking the first steps that potentially happen in vivo. In the case of tumour development, Sp3 could first be considered as a tumour suppressor during the initial steps, then as an oncogene, since it boosts growth and angiogenesis. Accumulation of Sp3 could be the result of increased ERKs activity since ERKs-induced Sp3 phosphorylation results in increased half-life <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0004478-Pages1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. The initiation of tumour development by oncogenes would allow adjustment of Sp3 levels, thus controlling the balance between growth and apoptosis. The latter (i.e. apoptosis) has been addressed by evaluating the genes activated upon Sp3 induction. Only 12 genes were modulated.

Since TGF&#x003b2; was maximally induced upon Sp3 overexpression and because its role on apoptosis was highly described, we tried to inhibit its action with blocking antibodies. No modification was observed suggesting that it is not the &#x0201c;master factor&#x0201d; implicated in Sp3-dependent apoptosis. The cell growth step of the mechanism has been addressed in two ways: 1) the possibility of obtaining cells resistant to Sp3-induced apoptosis through specific cleavage by caspase; the presence of a putative consensus cleavage site (DSSD) in the Sp3 sequence supports our results but the cleavage at this specific site needs to be confirmed; 2) formation of tumours in nude mice has highlighted in vivo selection processes. After an initial regression phase, a progression phase is observed. This progression coincides with an accumulation of the full-length form of Sp3. We hypothesised that the two phases observed in mice mimic the process which happens in human tumours resulting in <italic>in vivo</italic> selection of aggressive tumour cells with decrease apoptotic potential and increased growth and angiogenic capacities.</p><p>Our experiments have demonstrated the prognostic role of Sp3 in H&#x00026;N tumours.

The level of Sp3 in each cell or tumour sample was quantified with a GeneGnome imaging system (Syngene, Frederick, MD, USA) and normalised to the signals of &#x003b2;-actin and Sp3 present in LS174 cell extracts.</p></sec><sec id="s4i"><title>Statistics</title><p>Quantitative data were analysed using one-way ANOVA. Data were expressed as means&#x000b1;SEM. P&#x0003c;0.05 was considered to be significant. For tumour analysis, all categorical data were described using numbers (n.) and percentages (&#x00025;). Quantitative data were presented using median and range or mean and standard deviation. Censored data were described using Kaplan Meier estimation including median survival, and 95&#x00025; confidence intervals (95&#x00025; CI). Statistical analysis was two-sided and performed using R-2.5.0 for Windows. For univariate analysis, statistical comparisons were performed using the Chi-squared test or Fisher exact test for categorical data, the Student T test or Wilcoxon test for quantitative data, and Log-Rank test or Peto and Peto modification of the Gehan-Wilcoxon test for censored data. Multivariate analysis was performed by creating a Cox proportional hazards model. All variables associated with p&#x0003c;0.05 in the univariate analysis were included in the model. Proportional hazards tested for all entered variables using graphical (Schoenfeld residuals, log-log plot of cumulative hazard) and statistical methods. The search for interactions was automated using the R-2.5.0 stepAIC procedure, with interactions considered significant if p&#x0003c;0.01. Overall survival (OS) was defined as the interval between first diagnosis of cancer and death related to any cause. Follow-up was limited to 60 months for all patients. Patients lost to follow-up were censored after 60 months or at the date of their last known contact.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0004478.s001"><label>File S1</label><caption><p>List of the investigated genes</p><p>(0.05 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0004478.s001.doc" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0004478.s002"><label>File S2</label><caption><p>Sp3 overexpression do not affect p27 expression.
