A major gap in our understanding of PKR's antiviral properties concerns the nature of the kinase activating molecules expressed by influenza and other viruses with a negative strand RNA genome, as these pathogens produce little or no detectable amounts of dsRNA. Here we systematically investigated PKR activation by influenza B virus and its impact on viral pathogenicity. Biochemical analysis revealed that PKR is activated by viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) complexes known to contain single-stranded RNA with a 5&#x02032;-triphosphate group. Cell biological examination of recombinant viruses showed that the nucleo-cytoplasmic transport of vRNP late in infection is a strong trigger for PKR activation. In addition, our analysis provides a mechanistic explanation for the previously observed suppression of PKR activation by the influenza B virus NS1 protein, which we show here to rely on complex formation between PKR and NS1's dsRNA binding domain. The high significance of this interaction for pathogenicity was revealed by the finding that attenuated influenza viruses expressing dsRNA binding-deficient NS1 proteins were rescued for high replication and virulence in PKR-deficient cells and mice, respectively. Collectively, our study provides new insights into an important antiviral defense mechanism of vertebrates and leads us to suggest a new model of PKR activation by cytosolic vRNP complexes, a model that may also be applicable to other negative strand RNA viruses.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Upon viral infection of vertebrate cells, a vigorous innate defense response is initiated <italic>via</italic> the recognition of viral double-stranded (ds) RNA by the protein kinase PKR, resulting in the cessation of protein synthesis and subsequent blockage of viral propagation. The activation of PKR's potent antiviral response against influenza and other viruses with a negative strand RNA genome has presented a conundrum, however, as previous attempts failed to detect dsRNA in cells infected with these viruses. Here, we identify genomic RNA within the ribonucleoprotein (RNP) of influenza viruses as a non-canonical activator of the latent kinase PKR. Cell biological examinations revealed that the transfer of viral RNP from the nucleus to the cytoplasm provides a strong stimulus for PKR activation. Moreover, we provide insight into mechanisms of pathogenesis by showing PKR and the NS1 protein of influenza B virus forms a complex in infected cells, which inhibits PKR activation. This interaction seems to be crucial for viral pathogenicity, as a strong attenuation of NS1 mutant viruses was largely rescued in PKR-deficient mice and cells. Taken together, these findings suggest a new model for the induction and inhibition of PKR by influenza virus that may also apply to viruses with a similar genome structure.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The presence and replication of viral nucleic acids in vertebrate cells triggers innate immune responses by the activation of antiviral enzymes and induction of type I interferon (IFN) genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000473-GarciaSastre1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

Activation of PKR during infection involves recognition of viral nucleic acids, which induces a structural rearrangement leading to dimerization and autophosphorylation of the kinase at threonine residues 446 and 451 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000473-Sadler1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. The best-studied natural target site of activated PKR is serine 51 of the alpha subunit of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2&#x003b1;). Its phosphorylation brings about a translational block of cellular and viral mRNAs and hence, a strong impairment of viral replication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000473-Sadler1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000473-Garcia1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, PKR controls transcriptional activation of the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-&#x003ba;B) pathway and was also shown to mediate apoptosis and to function as a tumour suppressor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000473-Garcia1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Many virus families have evolved gene products targeting PKR, illustrating the high relevance of this kinase in antiviral defense <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000473-Garcia1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000473-Gale1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. The inhibitory mechanisms include PKR degradation, sequestration of viral dsRNA by a viral protein, preventing PKR activation through inhibitory viral proteins or viral decoy RNA, and regulating the phosphorylation of eIF2&#x003b1; through a viral pseudosubstrate or recruitment of a cellular phosphatase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000473-Garcia1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Early studies identified dsRNA with a minimum length of 34 base pairs as a prototypical activator of PKR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000473-Manche1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref> and the sources of these kinase-inducing nucleic acids have been well recognized for several classes of viruses: Complex DNA viruses such as vaccinia virus, adenovirus or herpes simplex virus transcribe open reading frames in opposite orientations leading to formation of duplex RNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000473-Jacobs1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. In reovirus-infected cells, the viral genome consists of dsRNA and also the genomes of many plus-strand RNA viruses contain long stretches of extensively base-paired secondary structure elements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000473-Jacobs1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. Surprisingly, there is little knowledge about the specific nucleic acids of influenza and other negative-sense RNA viruses that trigger PKR activation, as earlier attempts failed to detect dsRNA in cells infected with such viruses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000473-Pichlmair1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000473-Weber1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. Progress in this area has been hampered in part by viral suppressors of PKR, which necessitates the application of reverse genetic procedures for such analyses.</p><p>The influenza A and B viruses are globally distributed pathogens of the <italic>Orthomyxoviridae</italic> family that cause acute severe respiratory disease and around 40,000 deaths each year in the European Union alone (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ecdc.europa.eu/Health_topics/influenza/facts.html">http://ecdc.europa.eu/Health_topics/influenza/facts.html</ext-link>). These viruses have a segmented genome that consists of eight single-stranded viral RNAs (vRNA) of negative polarity with short complementary sequences at their 5&#x02032;- and 3&#x02032;-ends <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000473-Palese1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. The vRNAs carry a triphosphate group at their 5&#x02032;-ends and associate with the viral polymerase complex and the nucleoprotein NP into viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP). In the nucleus, the viral polymerase synthesizes mRNAs and positive strand cRNAs that serve as templates for new vRNAs.

Such a scenario is unlikely, however, as production of viral RNAs with opposite polarities is a nuclear event <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000473-Palese1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, whereas activation of PKR occurs in the cytoplasm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000473-Tian1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. It was also proposed that influenza virus infection induces PACT, a stress-activated protein activator of PKR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000473-Li1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, but the dependency of PKR induction on PACT expression during viral infection has not been reported yet.</p><p>Despite uncertainty regarding the mode of PKR stimulation, it is well established that the influenza A and B virus NS1 proteins (A/NS1 and B/NS1, respectively) function as PKR antagonists since mutant viruses with defects in the NS1 gene, but not wild-type virus, are potent PKR activators <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000473-Bergmann1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000473-Hatada1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. The NS1 proteins of both virus types are multifunctional proteins consisting of 202&#x02013;237 and 281 amino acids (aa), respectively. Although their overall sequence identity is below 25&#x00025;, they carry a similarly structured N-terminal dsRNA binding domain located at positions 1&#x02013;73 (type A) and 1&#x02013;93 (type B) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000473-Yin1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Both NS1 proteins bind to the same RNAs <italic>in vitro</italic> including synthetic dsRNA, U6 RNA, and poly(A)-RNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000473-Wang1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>; however, at present it is unclear whether the NS1 proteins sequester viral dsRNA in the same way as other viral PKR antagonistic proteins, how dsRNA binding is related to PKR inhibition and if the A/NS1 and B/NS1 proteins block PKR activation by the same or different mechanism(s). Interpretation of studies aiming to define the interactions of influenza viruses with PKR and their significance for virus propagation is complex due to the multifaceted nature of NS1 protein function. The NS1 proteins not only inhibit PKR, but also downregulate the signals leading to the activation of type I IFN genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000473-Dauber1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000473-Dauber2">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000473-Wang2">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover, the A/NS1 protein was shown to inhibit the maturation and export of cellular pre-mRNAs, to enhance translation, to inhibit the 2&#x02032;-5&#x02032;- oligo adenylate synthetase (OAS) and to activate the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000473-delaLuna1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000473-Satterly1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. In contrast, it is a specific function of the influenza B virus NS1 protein to inhibit the conjugation of the antiviral ISG15 gene product to cellular targets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000473-Lenschow1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000473-Yuan1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>.

Thus, a given mutation in the NS1 gene may affect multiple functions, thereby complicating the assignment of a specific host factor as being responsible for a certain phenotype.</p><p>In the present report, we propose a novel concept for the induction and control of PKR by influenza viruses that may also apply to other negative strand RNA viruses. Analysis of recombinant viruses showed that activation of PKR is triggered upon the appearance of viral RNP in the cytoplasm late in infection.

Based on several lines of evidence, we put forward the hypothesis that influenza virus RNP functions as a non-canonical activator of PKR in the cytosol: First, PKR autophosphorylation in infected cells occurred concomitantly with the cytosolic appearance of vRNP, when a functional NS1 protein was absent. Second, PKR activation was largely abolished when the nucleo-cytoplasmic export of vRNP was blocked by LMB treatment. Third, biochemical analysis demonstrated that purified vRNP activates PKR in an <italic>in vitro</italic> kinase assay directly. The RNA-dependency of this stimulation was shown by its sensitivity to pre-treatment with single- and double-strand-specific RNases and the failure of the vRNP to activate a dsRNA binding-defective PKR. We favour the explanation that the vRNA promoter structure formed by the partially complementary 5&#x02032;- and 3&#x02032;-ends within vRNP is an important determinant for PKR activation.

In fact, the present study is the first characterization of a natural viral RNA/RNP with a 5&#x02032;-triphosphate group that triggers PKR, as the studies mentioned above tested exclusively synthetic model RNAs. Our mechanistic model suggests PKR can contact RNA residues within the vRNP despite their association with the viral NP and polymerase proteins.</p><p>A second novel aspect of our study centres on the mode by which the influenza B virus NS1 protein inhibits PKR. Previously, we showed that dsRNA binding mutations within NS1 prevented PKR inhibition, but did not eliminate the suppression of IFN induction that is triggered through the RNA helicase RIG-I <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000473-Pichlmair1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000473-Dauber1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000473-Hornung1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>. Our new study explains the former observation by showing that the NS1 protein entangles PKR into an immunoprecipitable complex in infected cells. These PKR-NS1 complexes were sensitive to treatment with dsRNA-specific RNase and the interaction required a functional NS1 dsRNA binding domain. The most likely interpretation of these findings is that RNA to which both proteins bind facilitates the interaction of PKR and NS1. Interestingly, the association with PKR appears to be necessary but not sufficient to preclude its activation. In fact, all NS1 mutants that were not associated with PKR failed to block kinase activation (this study; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000473-Pichlmair1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000473-Dauber1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000473-Hornung1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>), but the NS1 mutant #1 did not prevent PKR activation even though it interacted with the enzyme. Clearly, more work is required to determine the whole catalogue of events leading to the blockade of PKR by influenza B virus. Slightly different modes of PKR association, which did not require dsRNA binding in GST pull-down assays were suggested for the A/NS1 protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000473-Min2">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000473-Tan1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>. We have therefore initiated comparative studies to determine whether the two divergent NS1 proteins employ different or similar ways to block PKR.</p><p>At present, we can only speculate about the nature of the RNA component in NS1-PKR complexes in influenza B virus-infected cells. The presented data argue for a scenario in which cytoplasmic vRNP complexes are recognized by PKR and provide the major stimulus for its activation. We detected both vRNA and the NS1 protein in PKR immunoprecipitates from infected cell lysate raising the possibility that NS1 prohibits activation of PKR by cytosolic vRNP through the formation of a hetero-trimeric complex. However, we cannot rule out the option that binding of NS1 to PKR in infected cells is mediated by a yet undetermined viral or host-derived nucleic acid; for that reason more work will be required to elucidate the specific components involved.</p><p>The influenza B virus non-structural NS1 protein has apparently evolved in a way that suits the specific needs of the pathogen to inhibit PKR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000473-g006">Fig. 6</xref>). During the first hours of infection viral RNPs are confined to the nucleus and not accessible for the cytosolic sensor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000473-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>). At later stages, the vRNPs are exported to the cytoplasm where they assemble into progeny virions at the plasma membrane. Cytoplasmic vRNPs act as PKR activators in the absence of functional NS1 protein, thus reducing protein synthesis and virus growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000473-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>). However, in the wild-type situation NS1 protein is expressed and prevents activation of PKR by vRNPs, thereby facilitating full-level synthesis of structural viral proteins and efficient viral propagation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000473-g006">Fig. 6C</xref>). This scenario is supported by the dynamic intracellular trafficking of the B/NS1 protein showing that it migrates to nuclear speckles early in infection, but relocalizes to the cytoplasm at later time-points <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000473-Schneider1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>.

Further observations suggest that also non-segmented negative-strand RNA viruses may induce PKR by a ribonucleoprotein structure; for instance, the Ebola virus VP35 protein counteracts stimulation of PKR, indicating indirectly that members of the <italic>Filoviridae</italic> family activate and prevent induction of the kinase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000473-Feng1">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref>.

Exploring the methods used by viral pathogens to counteract PKR not only promises an improved understanding of the innate immune defense against viral infections, but may also foster the development of novel therapeutic substances. Our study suggests that it should be possible to shift the course of influenza virus infection from efficient pathogen replication towards its elimination <italic>via</italic> the body's innate defense if the NS1-mediated blockade of PKR could be suspended. The recent description of substances capable to modulate NS1's activity in IFN suppression supports the concept that this viral protein is indeed amenable to control by therapeutic substances <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000473-Basu1">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cells and viruses</title><p>293T and A549 cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10&#x00025; fetal calf serum (FCS), 2 mM <sc>l</sc>-glutamine, and antibiotics.
