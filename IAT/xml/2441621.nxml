Phox2b in particular plays a key role in the specification of branchiomotor neurons. In its absence, generic neuronal differentiation is defective in the progenitor domain and no branchiomotor neurons are produced. Conversely, ectopic expression of Phox2b in spinal regions of the neural tube promotes cell cycle exit and neuronal differentiation and, at the same time, induces genes and an axonal phenotype characteristic for branchiomotor neurons.

They arise in the hindbrain and rostral cervical spinal cord from the ventralmost progenitor domain characterized by expression of the transcription factors Nkx2.2, Mash1 and Phox2b [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Targeted mutation in the mouse has shown that their development crucially depends on <italic>Phox2b </italic>whereas the inactivation of <italic>Nkx2.2 </italic>or <italic>Mash1 </italic>results in only mild defects of bm development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In the absence of Phox2b, the differentiation of all bm neurons is arrested at an early stage and their precursors either die by apoptosis or switch fate and become serotonergic neurons. Conversely, Phox2b induces neurons with bm characteristics when misexpressed in the neural tube of chicken embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Hence, <italic>Phox2b </italic>appears both necessary and sufficient for the implementation of a specific cranial motoneuronal phenotype. Loss and gain of function experiments also show that Phox2b has proneural activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and promotes cell cycle exit and generic neuronal differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] (see for review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]). The development of the facial bm (fbm) neurons that arise in rhombomere 4 (r4) has been particularly well studied in the <italic>Phox2b </italic>knockout embryos. A number of downstream target genes have been identified that depend on <italic>Phox2b </italic>for their expression in fbm neurons by examining expression of candidate genes and by a subtractive screening approach. They include generic markers for young post-mitotic neurons (<italic>Tubb3</italic>, <italic>Nfl</italic>, <italic>Ebf2</italic>, <italic>Math3</italic>) and genes more specifically associated with bm neuron differentiation (<italic>Phox2a</italic>, <italic>Islet1</italic>, <italic>Rgs4</italic>, <italic>Tbx20</italic>) ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and unpublished results).</p><p>Despite this wealth of information, only part of the genetic program that depends on <italic>Phox2b </italic>in fbm neurons has been identified. Indeed, the subtractive screening approach proved far from exhaustive since most previously identified downstream genes were not detected and none were found to be up-regulated in the mutants. Here we have used microarrays to compare the patterns of gene expression in fbm precursors from homozygous (<italic>Phox2b</italic><sup><italic>LacZ</italic>/<italic>LacZ</italic></sup>) mutants, in which fbm differentiation is arrested, with that of heterozygous Phox2b (<italic>Phox2b</italic><sup><italic>LacZ</italic>/+</sup>) embryos, in which fbm neurons are phenotypically normal. In addition to genes already identified in previous work, a number of new candidates turned up in the screen, among which many were up-regulated in the mutants and might thus be repressed by Phox2b. Most of the down-regulated genes were panneuronally expressed in young post-mitotic neurons. They were thus expected to pop up in the screen, since fewer post-mitotic neurons are produced in the mutants, and were not analyzed further. We selected a few other genes for further study by gain of function experiments in chicken embryos: <italic>Gap43</italic>, whose expression, although panneuronal, was strikingly enhanced in post-mitotic fbm precursors; and two that were up-regulated in the mutants, <italic>Sfrp1 </italic>and <italic>Sox13</italic>. Overexpression of <italic>Sox13</italic>, whose function in neural development has not been studied so far, inhibited neuronal differentiation and the relocation to the mantle layer (ML) caused by <italic>Phox2b </italic>misexpression in the embryonic spinal cord, while that of <italic>Sfrp1 </italic>prevented the repression of the interneuronal marker Lhx1,5.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Identification of genes regulated by Phox2b in facial branchiomotor precursors</title><p>Phox2b being an important regulator of the development of bm neurons, we wanted to further investigate its function in the specification of bm neurons by searching for novel genes regulated by Phox2b in fbm neuron precursors. We thus chose to compare gene expression in ventral r4 from heterozygous (<italic>Phox2b</italic><sup><italic>LacZ</italic>/+</sup>) and homozygous (<italic>Phox2b</italic><sup><italic>LacZ</italic>/<italic>LacZ</italic></sup>) embryonic day 10.5 (E10.5) mutant embryos. At this stage, fbm differentiation is well underway in <italic>Phox2b</italic><sup>+/+ </sup>and <italic>Phox2b</italic><sup><italic>LacZ</italic>/+ </sup>animals while no signs of bm differentiation are seen in the homozygous mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Four pairs of <italic>Phox2b</italic><sup><italic>LacZ</italic>/+ </sup>and <italic>Phox2b</italic><sup><italic>LacZ</italic>/<italic>LacZ </italic></sup>RNA samples were amplified from microdissected ventral r4, labeled with Cy3 or Cy5, mixed and hybridized to two mouse cDNA microarrays, a microarray of the 15 K NIA probe set representing approximately 12,000 different genes and a home-made NeuroDev microarray representing 2,000 genes chosen for their expression in developing nervous tissue. We adopted as criteria for putative Phox2b-regulated genes a significance analysis of microarray (SAM) score (see Materials and methods) below -3.5 or above 3.5 for genes up- or down-regulated in the mutants, respectively, and a false discovery rate of 5%. By these criteria, 51 genes were found to be down-regulated and 23 up-regulated in the homozygous mutants (Additional files <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). Surprisingly, only three genes showed a greater than twofold change in expression. However, out of the 12 genes we selected for validation by <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization (ISH), 10 were confirmed as being clearly differentially expressed, despite fold changes as low as 1.14 and 1.13 for two of them (see below). Part of the rather low signal ratios on microarrays may be due to the fact that the floor plate, which should not be affected in the mutants, was always included in the material used for RNA preparation.</p><p>Only two of the genes that scored as underexpressed in the mutants, <italic>Tubb3 </italic>and <italic>Nfl</italic>, had been known from previous work ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] and unpublished data). We selected six for validation by ISH, which was done on sections through r4 from E10.5 <italic>Phox2b</italic><sup><italic>LacZ</italic>/+ </sup>and <italic>Phox2b</italic><sup><italic>LacZ</italic>/<italic>LacZ </italic></sup>embryos. The expression of one of them, <italic>Sncg</italic>, was not noticeably affected in the mutants (not shown). The remaining five fell into two categories. <italic>App</italic>, coding for the amyloid beta (A4) precursor protein, <italic>Mapk8</italic>, also known as Jun N-terminal kinase (<italic>Jnk1</italic>), and <italic>Tubb3</italic>, the <italic>beta3-tubulin </italic>gene (already documented in previous work) are pan-neuronal genes expressed in all developing neurons. In the mutants, their expression was interrupted at the dorsal border of the normally Phox2b<sup>+ </sup>territory (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a&#x02013;d</xref>). The small number of post-mitotic neurons that are generated in the homozygous mutants and locate to the ML, some of which are in the process of acquiring a serotonergic fate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], thus do not appear to activate these genes that are otherwise pan-neuronal. <italic>Gap43</italic>, a major growth cone protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], and to a lesser extent <italic>Nfl</italic>, coding for the neurofilament light chain, differed from the others by the fact that, although pan-neuronal as well, they were more strongly expressed in the fbm precursors than in other young post-mitotic neurons. Their expression was extinguished in the mutant territory (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1e&#x02013;h</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Expression patterns of a subset of genes down-regulated in ventral r4 of <italic>Phox2b</italic><sup><italic>LacZ</italic>/<italic>LacZ </italic></sup>embryos. <bold>(a-h) </bold><italic>In situ </italic>hybridizations on transverse sections of ventral r4 of <italic>Phox2b</italic><sup><italic>LacZ</italic>/+ </sup>(a, c, e, g) or <italic>Phox2b</italic><sup><italic>LacZ</italic>/<italic>LacZ </italic></sup>(b, d, f, h) E10.5 mouse embryos.

We therefore favored for further analysis up-regulated over down-regulated genes. We chose six genes among the candidates that were overexpressed in the mutants for validation by ISH. One of them, <italic>Fgfr1</italic>, did not show changes noticeable by ISH (not shown). The others revealed three distinct patterns of changes. In the heterozygotes, <italic>Igfbp5 </italic>was expressed in only part of the <italic>Phox2b</italic><sup>+ </sup>territory in the ventricular zone (VZ) and was excluded from the mantle layer (ML), while in the homozygotes, it showed a patchy distribution throughout the <italic>Phox2b</italic><sup>+ </sup>VZ and was strongly expressed in the ML (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a, b</xref>). Igfbp5 is a member of a family of modulators of insulin-like growth factor (IGF) activity that may also have IGF-independent functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Like in our screen, <italic>Igfbp5 </italic>has obtained top scores in other differential screens on neural tissues (see, for instance, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]), signifying perhaps that their expression is exceptionally labile. Their role in neural development has not been explored. Since Igfbp5 has been found to colocalize with areas of apoptosis during development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], its overexpression may be related to the increased apoptosis caused by lack of <italic>Phox2b </italic>activity in ventral r4. <italic>Hes1</italic>, best known as an effector of Notch signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], is normally weakly expressed in the floor plate and more strongly in the dorsalmost part of the <italic>Phox2b</italic><sup>+ </sup>VZ in the E10.5 hindbrain, but it invades most of the normally <italic>Phox2b</italic>-expressing VZ in a salt-and-pepper pattern in the mutants (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2c, d</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Expression patterns of a subset of genes up-regulated in ventral r4 of <italic>Phox2b</italic><sup><italic>LacZ</italic>/<italic>LacZ </italic></sup>embryos. <bold>(a-j) </bold><italic>In situ </italic>hybridizations on transverse sections of ventral r4 of <italic>Phox2b</italic><sup><italic>LacZ</italic>/+ </sup>(a, c, e, g, i) or <italic>Phox2b</italic><sup><italic>LacZ</italic>/<italic>LacZ </italic></sup>(b, d, f, h, j) E10.5 mouse embryos.

In the mutant territory, their expression extended up to the neural tube border, thus including the post-mitotic neurons in the ML (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2e&#x02013;h</xref>). A similar expansion into the mutant ML has been found in previous work for <italic>Dll1 </italic>and <italic>Nkx2.2</italic>, which are normally confined to the VZ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In contrast to <italic>Tcf3</italic>, <italic>Sfrp1 </italic>appeared also to be up-regulated throughout the mutant VZ: the signal given by the <italic>Sfrp1 </italic>probe was stronger outside of the fbm progenitors in <italic>Phox2b</italic><sup><italic>LacZ</italic>/+ </sup>embryos, but the reverse was true in <italic>Phox2b</italic><sup><italic>LacZ</italic>/<italic>LacZ </italic></sup>animals. Tcfs are transcription factors that function in the Wnt signaling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Secreted frizzled-related proteins (Sfrps) also function mainly in the Wnt pathway as antagonists of Wnt signaling, but Sfrp1 may also exert a Wnt-independent activity as a stimulator of neurite outgrowth and as a growth cone attractant for retinal axons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>The <italic>Sox </italic>genes code for an extended family of SRY-box-containing transcriptional regulators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Sox13, a member of the SoxD group, has been identified as a diabetes autoantigen expressed in pancreatic beta-cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and recently as a positive regulator of gamma-delta T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. We found <italic>Sox13 </italic>to be expressed throughout most of the VZ, but almost absent in fbm progenitors. In the <italic>Phox2b </italic>mutants, its expression in the normally <italic>Phox2b</italic><sup>+ </sup>VZ becomes as strong as elsewhere in the VZ (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2i&#x02013;l</xref>). We then asked whether <italic>Sox13 </italic>would also be excluded from the trigeminal bm progenitors in r2 that also express and depend on <italic>Phox2b</italic>. In ventral r2, <italic>Phox2b </italic>is expressed in the VZ and bm neuron production is underway at E9.5. One day later, bm neuron production has ceased and <italic>Phox2 </italic>is down-regulated in the VZ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. At E9.5, strong <italic>Sox13 </italic>expression in the VZ was interrupted at the border of the <italic>Phox2b</italic><sup>+ </sup>territory, similar to what has been observed for the E10.5 fbm progenitors. At E10.5, when <italic>Phox2b </italic>expression was about to disappear in the VZ, <italic>Sox13 </italic>became clearly detectable in the ventralmost progenitor domain (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a&#x02013;d</xref>). Cessation of <italic>Phox2b </italic>expression and bm neuron production in ventral r2 is accompanied by a fate switch of the progenitors, which now produce serotonergic neurons. Their production depends on <italic>Mash1 </italic>activity, in the absence of which serotonergic neurons are not produced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. We thus asked whether the expansion of <italic>Sox13 </italic>expression would take place in <italic>Mash1 </italic>mutants.

To search for Phox2b-regulated genes by a more systematic approach, we have used gene expression profiling of ventral r4, in which the fbm precursors arise, from heterozygous and homozygous <italic>Phox2b </italic>mutant embryos. In this way we have identified a number of candidates that are either up- or down-regulated in the homozygous mutants. Two of these candidates regulated by Phox2b had been identified in previous work, but none of the others have been reported before. We restrict our discussion to those candidates we confirmed by ISH as being regulated by Phox2b in ventral r4.</p><p>Our analysis did not distinguish between genes that were under direct control of Phox2b and genes that depended on Phox2b indirectly, through the action of other transcription factors. However, the genes that we found induced or repressed in the chicken spinal cord already at 24 hae can be supposed to be proximal targets in the genetic program induced by Phox2b, and not to be dependent on a vast network of other factors. So far, only transcriptional activation by Phox2b has been demonstrated, but the possibility exists that it may also act as a repressor, as indicated by the observation that repressor forms of Phox2b reproduced some of the effects of Phox2b [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Since less post-mitotic neurons are produced in the mutant territory, it was to be expected that many genes that are normally expressed in young post-mitotic neurons would be underrepresented in <italic>Phox2b</italic><sup><italic>LacZ</italic>/<italic>LacZ </italic></sup>embryos. <italic>App</italic>, <italic>Mapk8</italic>, <italic>Nfl </italic>and <italic>Gap43 </italic>belong to this category.

In our study, <italic>Gap43 </italic>overexpression in the embryonic neural tube did not produce overt morphological alterations. Hence, its effects might be limited to terminal fields and situations of regeneration. A number of discrete developmental defects have been reported in <italic>Gap43 </italic>mutants, including pathfinding defects of the optic nerve [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], a reduction in serotonergic innervation of the forebrain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] and a failure to form the anterior commissure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Such a subtle phenotype for a gene expressed in virtually all young neurons may be due to redundancy with the <italic>CAP23 </italic>gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>].</p><p>Among the genes found to be up-regulated in mutant ventral r4, <italic>Hes1</italic>, at the stage studied, was expressed only in the dorsalmost part of the Phox2b<sup>+ </sup>VZ in wild-type or heterozygous animals. In <italic>Phox2b</italic><sup><italic>LacZ</italic>/<italic>LacZ </italic></sup>embryos, its expression invaded most of the normally Phox2b<sup>+ </sup>domain. The basic-helix-loop-helix transcription factor of the <italic>hairy and enhancer of split </italic>family, Hes1 is best known as an effector of Notch signaling and, together with its paralogues Hes3 and Hes5, plays a crucial role in maintaining the progenitor state of neuroepithelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Since Phox2b drives neural progenitors to exit the cell cycle and to differentiate, it is perhaps not surprising that it shuts off a negative regulator of neural differentiation. This scheme, however, is complicated by the observation that its paralogue <italic>Hes5 </italic>has been found to be down-regulated in <italic>Phox2b</italic><sup><italic>LacZ</italic>/<italic>LacZ </italic></sup>embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. It appears that the lack of proneural activity in <italic>Phox2b </italic>mutants and the consecutive down-regulation of the Notch ligand Dll1 in the VZ affect differently the two paralogous genes. The Lef/Tcf proteins are transcription factors that play pivotal roles in Wnt signaling, functioning mainly as repressors in the absence and as obligatory co-activators of beta-catenin in the presence of Wnt ligands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Tcf3 has remained the most enigmatic member of the family. Loss of <italic>Tcf3 </italic>results in early gastrulation defects and perhaps as a consequence to broad defects in neural tube patterning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. <italic>Tcf3 </italic>has been said to become undetectable in the mouse embryo from E10.5 onward [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], but we found it strongly expressed in E10.5 r4 throughout the VZ. Normally excluded from the ML, its expression domain invaded the ML in the mutant territory. This has been observed in previous work also for <italic>Nkx2.2 </italic>and <italic>Dll1 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Apparently, the post-mitotic cells that accumulate in the mutant ML are not only unable to express generic neuronal markers but also do not switch off genes whose expression is normally confined to the VZ.</p><p><italic>Sfrp1 </italic>shared with <italic>Tcf3 </italic>the tendency to be expressed in the mutant ML, from which it was normally excluded. However, the expression pattern of <italic>Sfrp1 </italic>in r4 was much more circumscribed than that of <italic>Tcf3</italic>. It was only expressed in ventral r4, including the <italic>Phox2b</italic><sup>+ </sup>progenitor domain and extending up to the middle of the basal plate. In <italic>Phox2b</italic><sup><italic>LacZ</italic>/+ </sup>embryos, its expression was stronger dorsal to the <italic>Phox2b</italic><sup>+ </sup>progenitors, but the reverse was true in <italic>Phox2b</italic><sup><italic>LacZ</italic>/<italic>LacZ </italic></sup>embryos. In the embryonic chicken spinal cord, we found <italic>Sfrp1 </italic>to be strongly expressed in the VZ of the dorsal basal plate, in line with previous results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>], and to be massively repressed by <italic>Phox2b</italic>. <italic>Sfrp1 </italic>overexpression in the chicken spinal cord up-regulated the interneuron marker Lhx1,5. When co-expressed with <italic>Sfrp1</italic>, <italic>Phox2b </italic>was still capable of inducing Islet1,2, but became unable to repress expression of Lhx1,5. Hence, co-expression of <italic>Phox2b </italic>and <italic>Sfrp1 </italic>results in a mixed phenotype that is not normally encountered in the spinal cord, as also indicated by the observation that <italic>Sfrp1 </italic>partially restored the ability of <italic>Phox2b</italic>-transfected neurons to grow commissural axons. However, expression of <italic>Pax2</italic>, another interneuronal marker that was down-regulated by <italic>Phox2b</italic>, was already reduced by expression of <italic>Sfrp1 </italic>alone and continued to be down-regulated when Sfrp1 was co-expressed with <italic>Phox2b</italic>.</p><p>The Sfrps have been mostly described as secreted inhibitors of Wnt signaling, but there is evidence that they are able to promote rather than to inhibit Wnt signaling in some contexts and that they can act through Wnt-independent mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. In the <italic>Wnt1</italic><sup>-/-</sup>; <italic>Wnt3a</italic><sup>-/- </sup>embryonic spinal cord, the dI4 (Lhx1,5<sup>+</sup>; Pax2<sup>+</sup>) subclass of interneurons has been found to be expanded at the expense of the dI1 and dI2 interneuron populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. In line with these results, we found that <italic>Sfrp1 </italic>increased the population of Lhx1,5-expressing cells. <italic>Sfrp1</italic>, however, down-regulated <italic>Pax2</italic>, suggesting that the effect of <italic>Sfrp1 </italic>overexpression cannot be explained solely by inhibition of Wnt signaling. Gain of function experiments in the chicken retina have shown that <italic>Sfrp1 </italic>promotes neuronal differentiation and the generation of retinal ganglion cells and cones at the expense of other cell types by a mechanism that does not involve inhibition of Wnt signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. In our study, <italic>Sfrp1 </italic>overexpression in the spinal cord did not cause an obvious increase in generic neuronal differentiation. Still, our results suggest that Sfrp1 plays a role in neuronal subtype specification as has been observed in the retina.</p><p>Transcription factors of the B-, C- and E-group Sox proteins have been found to play key roles during early neural development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. By contrast, much less is known about the expression of the D-group Sox proteins in neural tissues and virtually nothing is known about their function during central nervous system development. In our screen, the D-group <italic>Sox13 </italic>gene was the only <italic>Sox </italic>gene that scored as a <italic>Phox2b</italic>-regulated gene. A previous study reported Sox13 to be expressed mainly by differentiating neurons in the ML [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. At the slightly earlier stages and more caudal regions studied here, we found, by both ISH and antibody staining, Sox13 to be expressed throughout and confined to the VZ in both the mouse and chicken nervous systems. We found <italic>Sox13 </italic>to be expressed in the VZ in a salt-and-pepper pattern, patches of high signal intensity alternating with cells expressing lower levels, suggesting a highly dynamic expression pattern perhaps in relation to the commitment to differentiation. VZ cells that expressed constitutively high levels of <italic>Sox13 </italic>after transfection were proliferating as indicated by BrdU incorporation and many expressed the neural cell stem marker Sox2, but none the neuronal marker NeuN, whose expression in the ML was inhibited. These results may be interpreted to mean that the cells normally expressing lower levels were those destined to become neurons. In E10.5 ventral r4, Sox13 mRNA and protein expression, which was strong in more dorsal regions, was much weaker in the fbm progenitor domain, but invaded the normally <italic>Phoxb</italic><sup>+ </sup>region in the mutants. While Phox2b expression in the VZ and motor neuron production is prolonged in ventral r4, peak motor neuron production in r2 occurs at E9.5 and ceases around E10.5 together with Phox2b expression in the VZ, where the progenitors switch to the production of serotonergic neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Consequently, in E9.5 ventral r2, <italic>Sox13 </italic>expression was absent from ventral progenitors, but became detectable there one day later. At this stage, the basic-helix-loop-helix factor Mash1 has been found to be required in this domain as both the sole provider of proneural activity and a determinant of the serotonergic phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. As shown here, <italic>Sox13 </italic>expression did not expand into the ventral progenitor domain when <italic>Mash1 </italic>was absent, although <italic>Phox2b </italic>expression had ceased. One possibility is that <italic>Sox13 </italic>expression requires activation of the Notch pathway by its ligands, whose expression depends on proneural activity provided by Mash1, but more work is required to ascertain this. The idea that Sox13 may function as a Notch effector is also supported by the observation that its overexpression inhibits neurogenesis.</p><p>In contrast to what might have been expected from the pronounced down-regulation of <italic>Sox13 </italic>in <italic>Phox2b</italic>-expressing progenitors, <italic>Phox2b </italic>misexpression in spinal regions of the chicken neural tube did not result in downright repression, but areas of down-regulation alternated with regions with enhanced expression. Again, one reason may be that <italic>Sox13 </italic>expression depends on Notch activity, which may be repressed by <italic>Phox2b </italic>but enhanced in neighboring cells by the propensity of <italic>Phox2b </italic>to induce the Notch ligand Dll1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Constitutively high expression of <italic>Sox13</italic>, however, counteracted <italic>Phox2b </italic>activity in our ectopic expression paradigm. A major effect was to block the relocation of the transfected cells to the ML. In the presence of forced expression of <italic>Sox13</italic>, <italic>Phox2b </italic>was still able to promote cell cycle exit and neuronal differentiation, but now the Phox2b<sup>+</sup>, NeuN<sup>+ </sup>and BrdU<sup>- </sup>cells normally located in the ML accumulated in the VZ. Many of the doubly transfected cells expressed Sox2, which was totally absent from cells transfected with <italic>Phox2b </italic>alone, and Islet1,2 induction by <italic>Phox2b </italic>was inhibited in them. Hence, <italic>Sox13 </italic>appears to counteract the capacity of <italic>Phox2b </italic>to silence <italic>Sox2 </italic>expression and to induce a bm phenotype. However, blocking migration to the ML may still be the primary effect, since persistent <italic>Sox2 </italic>expression and inhibition of Islet1,2 induction may be consequences of the former. So far, the only <italic>in vivo </italic>function of <italic>Sox13 </italic>that has been reported is the promotion of, and a requirement for, proper development of the gamma/delta T cell lineage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. This has been attributed to the inhibition of Wnt signaling by direct interaction with the Wnt effector TCF1. Given that this also holds true for Sox13 function in the nervous system, it is interesting that two inhibitors of Wnt signaling, Sfrp1 and Sox13, appeared in our screen. However, Sfrp1 and Sox13 act on different processes: Sox13 inhibits generic neuronal differentiation while Sfrp1 affects cell type specification. Repression of both may thus be a prerequisite for proper development of bm neurons. Sox13 knockout mice die at birth from unknown reasons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], and this may well be because of defective neural development. Our results showing that <italic>Sox13 </italic>inhibits neurogenesis and blocks migration to the ML give a first glance of the possible <italic>in vivo </italic>functions of <italic>Sox13 </italic>in neural development, opening the way for future mechanistic studies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Mice and embryo dissection</title><p>Phox2b<sup>LacZ/+ </sup>mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>] were intercrossed and the hindbrains of E10.5 embryos were dissected out and incubated for 2 minutes at 37&#x000b0;C with 1 &#x003bc;g/&#x003bc;l fluorescein di-(beta-D-galactopyranoside) (Sigma-Aldrich, Lyon, France).

For each GenePix output file, two filters were applied, one to clear out spots and another one to discard saturating spots where the median foreground intensity was greater than 60,000 in one of the two channels. The resulting median foreground intensities were normalized, without background signal subtraction, for dye bias using a global Lowess correction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>]. An expression matrix for each type of microarray (eight experiments each) was created gathering all normalized ratio data (M values).

We chose in addition a SAM score above 3.5 or below -3.5 (for genes down- or up-regulated in the mutants, respectively) as an arbitrary cut-off since smaller scores increased the number of genes whose expression changes could not be confirmed by ISH.</p></sec><sec><title>Expression vectors and electroporation</title><p>We used <italic>pCAGGS::Phox2b-IRES2-EGFP </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], <italic>pCAGGS::Gap43</italic>-<italic>IRES2-EGFP</italic>, <italic>pCAGGS::Sox13-IRES2-EGFP</italic>, <italic>pCAGGS::Sfrp1-IRES2-EGFP </italic>or <italic>pCAGGS::IRES2-EGFP </italic>to express mouse <italic>Phox2b</italic>, mouse <italic>Gap43</italic>, human <italic>SFRP1 </italic>(the latter two subcloned from IMAGE clones) and human <italic>Sox13 </italic>(subcloned from Ultimate ORF Clone IOH44934, Invitrogen) together with <italic>GFP </italic>or <italic>GFP </italic>alone in the chicken neural tube driven by a composite chicken beta actin-CMV promoter.
