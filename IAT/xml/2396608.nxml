The distal half of the germ line is a syncytium, with multiple germ nuclei sharing a common cytoplasm. At the distal tip of the two gonad arms, germ line stem cells interact with the distal tip cell, which maintains them in a mitotic stem cell fate (the mitotic zone) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. As the nuclei proceed proximally down the germ line and lose contact with the distal tip cell niche, they exit mitosis and begin meiotic differentiation (the transition zone).</p><p>When the nuclei enter meiosis and arrest at pachytene in the meiotic zone, they are associated with the germ line cortex, resulting in a nucleus-free inner core of cytoplasm called the rachis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Germ line plasma membrane invaginates between the nuclei to partially enclose them, forming a characteristic "T" structure of plasma membrane surrounding the meiotic germ nuclei [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Somatic sheath cells partially envelop the germ line and extend filopodia over bare regions, but do not extend protrusions deeply between germ line plasma membrane invaginations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. As pachytene nuclei reach the flexure, or bend, of the gonad arm, individual meiotic nuclei enter diakinesis and become completely enclosed by plasma membrane to complete oogenesis. Oocytes are fertilized as they move proximally through the spermatheca.</p><p>In recent years, genes and signals that control mitotic stem cell character and meiotic differentiation have been identified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. LAG-2 Delta in the distal tip and GLP-1 Notch in the germ line are required to maintain the mitotic stem cell fate in the distal tip cell niche and to repress the translation of meiotic differentiation factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. As germ nuclei leave the niche, the meiotic differentiation factors GLD-1, 2, and 3 and NOS-1 promote meiosis and repress GLP-1 translation and the mitotic fate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The transition zone contains a mix of mitotic and meiotic nuclei that reorganize to the cortex to form the rachis. Meiotic nuclei at the cortex arrest in pachytene until they reach the gonad flexure, where meiosis resumes and oogenesis begins. Ras/Map kinase signaling, including LET-60 Ras, is required for progression through pachytene and entry into diakinesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. While much is known about meiotic specification, less is known about the molecular mechanisms that control rachis organization in the meiotic zone, although Ras signaling is likely involved, as mutations in <italic>let-60 Ras </italic>and <italic>mpk-1 Erk </italic>cause disorganization of the pachytene region of the germline.</p><p>Described here are initial studies showing that the <italic>fli-1 </italic>gene perturbs rachis formation without affecting meiotic progression. In <italic>fli-1 </italic>mutants, chains of germ nuclei were observed in the rachis of the meiotic zone, and ultrastructural analysis revealed that these nuclei remained associated with germ line plasma membrane. Furthermore, extensions of the sheath cells protruded into the rachis between these misplaced nuclei. This phenotype is referred to here as a <underline>g</underline>erm <underline>l</underline>ine <underline>m</underline>orphogenesis defect (the Glm phenotype). No defects in mitotic or meiotic specification were observed in the misplaced nuclei or in any germ nuclei in <italic>fli-1 </italic>mutants.</p><p>The <italic>fli-1 </italic>locus was identified and found to encode a molecule with N-terminal leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) and 5 C-terminal gelsolin repeats, similar to the Drosophila and human Flightless 1 molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. <italic>C. elegans </italic>FLI-1 can bind to and sever actin filaments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], and a <italic>fli-1 </italic>mutation caused defects in a variety of tissues, including germ line organization defects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Human Flightless 1 (fliih), along with a monomer of G-actin, is a component of a transcriptional coactivator complex that acts with nuclear hormone receptors and &#x003b2;-catenin/TCF LEF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In Drosophila, <italic>Flightless 1 </italic>mutants display defects in flight muscle development as well as defects in nuclear organization and cellularization in the syncytial blastoderm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Thus, Flightless 1 molecules might have distinct roles in the cytoplasm and nucleus, possibly organizing the actin cytoskeleton in the former and modulating transcription in the latter.</p><p>The LET-60 Ras molecule has been shown to control meiotic progression from pachytene to diakinesis, and <italic>let-60 </italic>mutations were found to have a germ line organization defect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Data presented here show that <italic>let-60 Ras </italic>has a Glm phenotype similar to <italic>fli-1</italic>, and that <italic>let-60 Ras </italic>and <italic>fli-1 </italic>interact genetically in germ line morphogenesis. Thus, FLI-1 and LET-60 Ras might act together to control germ line organization and rachis formation during meiotic differentiation in the <italic>C. elegans </italic>germline.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title><italic>fli-1(ky535) </italic>affects germ line morphogenesis</title><p>The <italic>ky535 </italic>mutation was isolated in a synthetic lethal screen to identify molecules that act in parallel to the actin-binding protein UNC-115 abLIM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. UNC-115 and FLI-1 likely have roles in pharyngeal function underlying the synthetic lethal phenotype. Pharyngeal pumping is severely reduced in <italic>unc-115; fli-1 </italic>double mutants, and double mutants arrest in the L1 larval stage consistent with a feeding defect (data not shown).</p><p>Alone, <italic>fli-1(ky535) </italic>animals were viable and fertile and displayed a slightly Dumpy (Dpy) body morphology.

In most cases, chains of apparently connected nuclei spanned the rachis. Misplaced germ cells in the rachis were observed as soon as the rachis was evident in mid-to-late L4 larval animals (data not shown).

After 10 minutes of exposure to BrdU, wild-type animals displayed BrdU-positive nuclei in the distal mitotic zone (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1G</xref>). <italic>fli-1(ky535)</italic>-mutant gonads displayed a similar BrdU incorporation profile (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1H</xref>), and nuclei in the rachis of the meiotic zone did not incorporate BrdU. A 30-minute exposure to BrdU also resulted in no apparent differences between wild-type and <italic>fli-1(ky535) </italic>(data not shown).

In <italic>fli-1 </italic>mutants, the projections between misplaced nuclei in the meiotic zone were not from the distal tip cell, but were from the more proximally-located sheath cells that normally do not protrude deeply between nuclei.</p><p>Misplaced chains of nuclei in <italic>fli-1 </italic>mutants were not due to defects in meiotic progression, as all aspects of meiosis appeared normal in <italic>fli-1 </italic>mutants: nuclei in the meiotic zone did not incorporate BrdU, suggesting that they were post-mitotic; the morphology of misplaced nuclei was similar to normal meiotic nuclei as judged by DAPI staining and by electron microscopy. Thus, while <italic>fli-1 </italic>mutant germ nuclei apparently underwent meiosis normally, they failed to organize properly to form the rachis.</p><p>Data presented here suggest that <italic>fli-1 </italic>affects germ line morphogenesis without affecting meiotic progression or other aspects of germ line differentiation. However, <italic>fli-1(ky535) </italic>is a hypomorph and <italic>fli-1(tm362) </italic>homozygotes arrested in embryogenesis before germ line development (the germ line phenotype was scored in <italic>fli-1(tm362) </italic>heterozygotes). All <italic>fli-1 </italic>genotypes in which the Glm phenotype was scored had some <italic>fli-1 </italic>activity, so it is possible that complete loss of <italic>fli-1 </italic>activity in the germ line would affect other aspects germ line development not apparent in these studies (e.g. meiotic progression to diakinesis similar to <italic>let-60 Ras </italic>or other aspects of meiotic differentiation). Possibly, FLI-1 is required for the proper formation or maintenance of the rachis through effects on the actin cytoskeleton or the germline plasma membrane. Alternatively, FLI-1 might be part of a developmental program that coordinates rachis formation with other aspects of meiotic differentiation.</p></sec><sec><title>The Glm phenotype might be sensitive to gene dosage</title><p>Animals heterozygous for both <italic>fli-1(ky535) </italic>and <italic>fli-1(tm362) </italic>displayed the Glm phenotype. <italic>let-60 Ras </italic>was also haploinsufficient, as heterozygous <italic>let-60 Ras </italic>loss-of-function mutations displayed the Glm phenotype. These data suggest that precise dosages of FLI-1 and LET-60 Ras are required for normal germ line morphogenesis, and that reduction by as little as one half can cause the Glm phenotype. It is also possible that <italic>ky535 </italic>and <italic>tm362 </italic>are not simple loss-of-function alleles and that each might have a gain-of-function effect, explaining the Glm defect of heterozygous animals. In any case, RNAi of <italic>fli-1 </italic>results in the Glm phenotype, suggesting that the Glm phenotype is a consequence of loss of <italic>fli-1 </italic>function.</p><p>No nucleotide lesion associated with <italic>ky535 </italic>was detected in the region that can rescue the <italic>fli-1(ky535) </italic>and <italic>fli-1(tm362) </italic>Glm phenotypes. However, <italic>ky535 </italic>was mapped genetically to the <italic>fli-1 </italic>region using the Glm phenotype, and <italic>fli-1 </italic>RNAi phenocopied the <italic>ky535 </italic>phenotype. Furthermore, the Glm phenotype of <italic>ky535 </italic>was rescued by a <italic>fli-1(+) </italic>transgene containing only the <italic>fli-1 </italic>gene. Possibly, <italic>ky535 </italic>is a mutation outside of the rescuing region that reduces but does not abolish <italic>fli-1 </italic>expression, such as a mutation in a distal enhancer element. The haploinsufficiency of the <italic>fli-1 </italic>locus is consistent with this idea. The <italic>fli-1(tm362) </italic>deletion also displayed a haploinsufficient Glm phenotype rescued by a <italic>fli-1(+) </italic>transgene.</p></sec><sec><title>FLI-1 and LET-60 Ras might act together to control germ line morphogenesis</title><p><italic>let-60 Ras </italic>loss-of-function and dominant-negative mutations caused the Glm phenotype similar to <italic>fli-1</italic>. Constitutively-active alleles of <italic>let-60 Ras </italic>did not. Previous studies showed a germ cell organization defect in <italic>let-60 </italic>and <italic>mpk-1 </italic>mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. <italic>mpk-1 </italic>caused large clumps of nuclei with regions of the germline barren of nuclei, a defect rarely seen in the <italic>fli-1 </italic>and <italic>let-60 </italic>analyses described here. Possibly, the defects of <italic>fli-1 </italic>and <italic>mpk-1 </italic>are related, and <italic>mpk-1 </italic>has a stronger effect than <italic>fli-1</italic>. Alternatively, <italic>fli-1 </italic>and <italic>mpk-1 </italic>might affect distinct processes.</p><p>Interestingly, the Glm phenotype of <italic>fli-1 </italic>mutations was suppressed by constitutively-active <italic>let-60 Ras </italic>mutations, suggesting that LET-60 Ras overactivity compensated for FLI-1 loss of function. In these experiments, FLI-1 activity was reduced but not eliminated (<italic>ky535 </italic>is a hypomorph, and <italic>tm362 </italic>was heterozygous). Thus, it is possible that LET-60 Ras and FLI-1 act together in the same pathway or in parallel pathways to control germ line morphogenesis. The LRRs of <italic>C. elegans </italic>FLI-1 interact physically with human Ha-Ras in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] suggesting that FLI-1 and Ras might act in the same pathway. Another possibility is that <italic>let-60 </italic>controls <italic>fli-1 </italic>expression. Indeed, microarray expression analysis indicates that <italic>fli-1 </italic>transcript levels are increased by constitutively-active <italic>let-60(G12V) </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Further experiments will be required to test these models of FLI-1 and LET-60 interaction.</p></sec><sec><title>FLI-1 is expressed in the gonad</title><p>The <italic>fli-1 </italic>promoter was active in muscle cells and in the gonad. Anti-GFP Immunofluorescence revealed that FLI-1::GFP was associated with germ line nuclei. The expression pattern of <italic>fli-1 </italic>is consistent with expression in the germ line, but expression in the somatic sheath cells cannot be excluded. Furthermore, rescue of the <italic>fli-1(ky535) </italic>and <italic>fli-1(tm362) </italic>Glm phenotype could be due to somatic or germline transgene expression. FLI-1 might be expressed and active in the germ line, in the somatic sheath cells, or both. RNAi of <italic>fli-1 </italic>in <italic>rrf-1 </italic>mutants led to the Glm phenocopy, suggesting that knock-down of <italic>fli-1 </italic>in the germ line causes the Glm phenotype. However, <italic>fli-1 </italic>is very sensitive to gene dosage, so even slight perturbation of <italic>fli-1 </italic>in the soma of <italic>rrf-1 </italic>animals might be enough to cause the phenotype. <italic>fli-1 </italic>males also showed the Glm phenotype, and male gonads do not have somatic sheath cells. Together, these data suggest that <italic>fli-1 </italic>acts in the germ line, but they do not exclude the possibility that <italic>fli-1 </italic>acts in the sheath cells or in another tissue.</p><p>Human Fliih acts in the nucleus as a component of a coactivator complex and with the TCF/LEF and &#x003b2;-catenin complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. However, Fliih also associates with microtubule- and actin-based structures in the cytoplasm of fibroblasts, and acts with small GTPase and PI3 kinase signaling in the cytoplasm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. It is unclear from these experiments if FLI-1 acts in the nucleus or cytoplasm in germ line morphogenesis. FLI-1 could act in the nucleus to regulate expression along with Ras signaling. Alternatively, FLI-1 could act in the cytoplasm in a pathway parallel to a transcriptionally-dependent Ras pathway, possibly by modulating cytoskeletal architecture involved in germ line reorganization, although no defects in germ line actin organization were apparent. Further studies will address these models of molecular mechanisms of FLI-1 and LET-60 Ras function in germ line morphogenesis.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This work describes the role of the FLI-1 molecule in germ line morphogenesis in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. While much is known about meiotic differentiation in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, less is known about the mechanisms that control meiotic germ cells organization at the periphery of the germ line to form a germ cell-free core of cytoplasm called the rachis. Mutations in <italic>fli-1 </italic>perturb rachis organization without perturbing meiotic differentiation. In <italic>fli-1</italic>, germ cell nuclei occupied positions in the rachis; these misplaced nuclei were partially enclosed by germ line plasma membrane as were nuclei at the cortex; and extension of the gonadal sheath cells were associated with misplaced nuclei deep in the rachis. Mutations in <italic>let-60 Ras </italic>also displayed this phenotype, and constitutively-active LET-60 partially compensated for loss of FLI-1, indicating that LET-60 Ras and FLI-1 might act together to control germ line morphogenesis. These studies describe a developmental role for the FLI-1 molecule in germ line morphogenesis and demonstrate a functional interaction between FLI-1 and Ras GTPases in this process.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title><italic>C. elegans </italic>strains and genetics</title><p><italic>C. elegans </italic>were cultured by standard techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].
