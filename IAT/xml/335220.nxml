Only one apparently functional mRNA has been identified thus far and this encodes a novel 25 kDa nuclear protein. In this report, we find that the XLR gene family is composed of 50-75 copies per haploid genome which localize to at least two different portions of the mouse X chromosome. Neither of these locations are near the xid mutation that earlier work had correlated with XLR. In addition, some members of this family are also on the Y chromosome. Another surprising finding is that while the fourteen genomic clones examined to date have the same exon-intron structure and are closely related with respect to sequence conservation (90%), all appear (in most cases by multiple criteria) to be non-functional, raising the possibility that all but one of the members of this large semi-dispersed family are pseudogenes.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00140-0362-a" xlink:role="9880"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00140-0363-a" xlink:role="9881"/></fig><fig id="F3"><graphic xlink:href="nar00140-0364-a" xlink:role="9882"/></fig><fig id="F4"><graphic xlink:href="nar00140-0366-a" xlink:role="9884"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00140-0353.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9871"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00140-0354.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9872"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00140-0355.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9873"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00140-0356.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9874"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00140-0357.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9875"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00140-0358.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9876"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00140-0359.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9877"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00140-0360.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9878"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00140-0361.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9879"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00140-0362.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9880"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00140-0363.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9881"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00140-0364.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9882"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00140-0365.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9883"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00140-0366.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9884"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00140-0367.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9885"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00140-0368.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9886"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00140-0369.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9887"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00140-0370.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="9888"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
