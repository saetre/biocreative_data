The symbionts, by provisioning nutrients lacking from diets, allow various insects to occupy or dominate ecological niches that might otherwise be unavailable. One such insect is the glassy-winged sharpshooter <italic>(Homalodisca coagulata),</italic> which feeds on xylem fluid, a diet exceptionally poor in organic nutrients. Phylogenetic studies based on rRNA have shown two types of bacterial symbionts to be coevolving with sharpshooters: the gamma-proteobacterium <named-content content-type="genus-species">Baumannia cicadellinicola</named-content> and the <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic> species <named-content content-type="genus-species">Sulcia muelleri</named-content>. We report here the sequencing and analysis of the 686,192&#x02013;base pair genome of <named-content content-type="genus-species">B. cicadellinicola</named-content> and approximately 150 kilobase pairs of the small genome of <italic>S. muelleri,</italic> both isolated from <italic>H. coagulata.</italic> Our study, which to our knowledge is the first genomic analysis of an obligate symbiosis involving multiple partners, suggests striking complementarity in the biosynthetic capabilities of the two symbionts: <named-content content-type="genus-species">B. cicadellinicola</named-content> devotes a substantial portion of its genome to the biosynthesis of vitamins and cofactors required by animals and lacks most amino acid biosynthetic pathways, whereas <named-content content-type="genus-species">S. muelleri</named-content> apparently produces most or all of the essential amino acids needed by its host. This finding, along with other results of our genome analysis, suggests the existence of metabolic codependency among the two unrelated endosymbionts and their insect host. This dual symbiosis provides a model case for studying correlated genome evolution and genome reduction involving multiple organisms in an intimate, obligate mutualistic relationship. In addition, our analysis provides insight for the first time into the differences in symbionts between insects (e.g., aphids) that feed on phloem versus those like <named-content content-type="genus-species">H. coagulata</named-content> that feed on xylem. Finally, the genomes of these two symbionts provide potential targets for controlling plant pathogens such as <italic>Xylella fastidiosa,</italic> a major agroeconomic problem, for which <named-content content-type="genus-species">H. coagulata</named-content> and other sharpshooters serve as vectors of transmission. </p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>Sequence data from two obligate bacterial endosymbionts of an insect--the glassy-winged sharpshooter--suggest there is metabolic co-dependency among them and their insect host.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Through mutualistic symbioses with bacteria, eukaryotes have been able to acquire metabolic capabilities that in turn have allowed the utilization of otherwise unavailable ecological niches. Among the diverse examples of such symbioses, those involving bacteria that live inside the cells of their host are of great interest. These &#x0201c;endo&#x0201d;-symbioses played a central role in the early evolution of eukaryotes (e.g., the establishment of the mitochondria and chloroplasts) and in many more recent diversification events such as animals living at deep-sea vents, corals, blood-feeding flies, carpenter ants, and several clades of sap-feeding insects.</p><p>Insects that feed primarily or entirely on sap are a virtual breeding ground for symbioses because this liquid rarely contains sufficient quantities of the nutrients that animals are unable to make for themselves. For example, the sole diet of most aphids is sap from phloem which is the component of the plant vascular system normally used to transport sugars and other organic nutrients. Despite the presence of many nutrients, phloem usually has little, if any, of the &#x0201c;essential&#x0201d; amino acids that cannot be synthesized by animals. To compensate, aphids engage in an obligate symbiosis with bacteria in the genus <italic>Buchnera,</italic> which, in exchange for sugar and simple, nonessential amino acids, synthesize the needed essential amino acids for their hosts. </p><p>The exact details of aphid- <italic>Buchnera</italic> interactions have been difficult to determine because no <italic>Buchnera</italic> has been cultivated outside its host. This limitation has been circumvented to a large degree by sequencing and analysis of multiple <italic>Buchnera</italic> genomes &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040188-b001">1</xref>&#x02013; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040188-b003">3</xref>&#x0005d;, which have provided detailed insights into the biology, evolution, and ecology of these symbioses. For example, despite having undergone massive amounts of gene loss in the time after they diverged from free-living <italic>Gammaproteobacteria,</italic> the <italic>Buchnera</italic> encode many pathways for the synthesis of essential amino acids. A critical component of these genomic studies is that, in most aphids, <italic>Buchnera</italic> is the only symbiont &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040188-b004">4</xref>&#x0005d;. This implies that when genome-based metabolic pathway reconstructions suggest that a particular <italic>Buchnera</italic> is unable to make all the essential nutrients for its host, either the reconstructions are wrong, or the host must be getting those nutrients from its diet. For example, although one of the <italic>Buchnera</italic> strains is predicted to not be able to incorporate inorganic sulfur for the production of cysteine and other compounds, sulfur-containing organic compounds are known to occur in the diet of its host aphid &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040188-b002">2</xref>&#x0005d;. </p><p>In many other sap-feeding insects, including some aphids, several heritable bacterial types are found often living in close proximity within specialized structures in the insect body (e.g., &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040188-b005">5</xref>&#x02013; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040188-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;). This is apparently the case for all insects that are strict xylem-sap feeders, which include cicadas, spittlebugs, and some leafhoppers &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040188-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d;. Xylem is the component of the plant vascular system that is primarily used to transport water and salts from the roots to the rest of the plant. Xylem sap has the lowest nitrogen or carbon content of any plant component and contains few organic compounds &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040188-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;. Although the composition varies among plant species and developmental stages, xylem fluid is always nutrient-poor, containing mostly inorganic compounds and minerals with small amounts of amino acids and organic acids &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040188-b011">11</xref>&#x02013; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040188-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;. As in phloem, the amino acids consist mainly of nonessential types such as glutamine, asparagine, and aspartic acid, with all essential ones absent or present in very low amounts. </p><p>Among xylem-feeders, sharpshooters (Insecta: Hemiptera: Cicadellidae: Cicadellinae) are a prominent group of about 2,000 species &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040188-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;, many of which are major pests of agriculture due to their roles as vectors of plant pathogens. Sharpshooters are known to possess two bacterial symbionts. One, called Candidatus <named-content content-type="genus-species">Baumannia cicadellinicola</named-content> (hereafter <italic>Baumannia</italic>), resembles <italic>Buchnera</italic> in having small genome size and a biased nucleotide composition favoring adenine and thymine (A &#x0002b; T) and in belonging to the Enterobacteriales group in the <italic>Gammaproteobacteria</italic> &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040188-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;. The other symbiont, which was recently named Candidatus <named-content content-type="genus-species">Sulcia muelleri</named-content> (hereafter <italic>Sulcia</italic>), is in the <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic> phylum (formerly called the Cytophaga-Flexibacter-Bacteroides, or CFB, phylum) and is distributed widely in related insect hosts &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040188-b009">9</xref>&#x0005d;. Both symbionts are vertically transmitted in eggs and are housed in a specialized bacteriome within developing nymphs and adults, and molecular phylogenetic studies show that both symbionts represent ancient associations dating to the origin of sharpshooters <italic>(Baumannia)</italic> or earlier <italic>(Sulcia)</italic> &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040188-b005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040188-b009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040188-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;. </p><p>We sought to apply genome sequencing and analysis methods to the sharpshooter symbioses. For a host species, we selected the glassy-winged sharpshooter, <named-content content-type="genus-species">Homalodisca coagulata</named-content>. This pest species has a rapidly expanding geographic range and inflicts major crop damage as a vector for the bacterium <italic>Xylella fastidiosa,</italic> the agent of Pierce's disease of grapes and other plant diseases &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040188-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;. Initially, we focused on the <italic>Baumannia</italic> symbiont with the idea that comparisons with the related <italic>Buchnera</italic> species would allow us to better identify differences that related to xylem versus phloem feeding. After completing the genome of this <italic>Baumannia,</italic> analysis revealed that many pathways that we expected to be present were missing. In contrast to the <italic>Buchnera-</italic>aphid symbioses, a second symbiont is present in sharpshooters, so we could not assume that the nutrients that would have been made by the missing pathways must be in the sharpshooter diet. Despite technical difficulties, we were able to obtain a significant portion of the genome of the <italic>Sulcia</italic> from the same wild-caught samples of <italic>H. coagulata.</italic></p><p>Here we present the analysis of these two genomic datasets and the striking finding that the symbionts appear to work in concert, and possibly even share metabolites, to produce all of the nutrients needed by the host to survive on its xylem diet.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results/Discussion</title><sec id="s2a"><title>General Features of the <italic>Baumannia</italic> Genome and Predicted Genes </title><p>The genome of <italic>Baumannia</italic> consists of one circular chromosome of 686,192 base pairs (bp) with an average G &#x0002b; C content of 33.23&#x00025; ( <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0040188-t001">Table 1</xref>). The genome size closely matches an earlier estimate from gel electrophoresis &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040188-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;. <italic>Baumannia</italic> has neither a strong GC skew pattern nor a <italic>dnaA</italic> homolog&#x02014;two features commonly used to identify origins of replication in bacteria. A putative origin was identified and designated as position 1, based on a weak but clear transition in oligonucleotide skew. </p><p>A total of 46 noncoding RNA genes were identified: six rRNAs (two sets of 16S, 5S, and 23S), one small RNA, and 39 tRNAs including at least one for each of the 20 amino acids.

Only four of the CDSs lack detectable homologs in GenBank or other complete genomes and thus can be considered &#x0201c;orphan&#x0201d; genes. </p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Evolution of <italic>Baumannia</italic> and the Genomes of Intracellular Organisms </title><p>Genome sequences have been found to be very useful in providing for better resolution and accuracy in phylogenetic trees than is achieved using single genes such as rRNA genes &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040188-b017">17</xref>&#x0005d;. Although there are many ways to build genome-based trees, one particularly powerful approach is to identify orthologous genes between species and to combine alignments of these genes into a single alignment. We built a tree for <italic>Baumannia</italic> and related species from 45 ribosomal proteins using this concatenation approach ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040188-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). This tree supports the rRNA-based grouping of <italic>Baumannia</italic> with the insect endosymbionts of the genera <italic>Buchnera, Wigglesworthia</italic> (symbionts of tsetse flies) <italic>,</italic> and <italic>Blochmania</italic> (symbionts of ants) &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040188-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;. However, the branching order is different in the protein tree with <italic>Baumannia</italic> being the deepest branching symbiont. As in prior genomic studies &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040188-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;, the insect endosymbionts in the tree in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040188-g002">Figure 2</xref>A are monophyletic (i.e., they share a common ancestor to the exclusion of all other species for which genomes are available). A possible close relationship of <italic>Baumannia</italic> to the other symbionts in the group is further supported by the presence of a substantial number of segments of conserved gene order ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040188-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). </p><p>All of these insect endosymbionts, including <italic>Baumannia,</italic> exhibit many genome-level trends commonly found in intracellular organisms when compared to free-living relatives, including a smaller genome, lower G &#x0002b; C content, a higher average predicted isoelectric point for encoded proteins, and more rapidly evolving proteins ( <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0040188-t001">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040188-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). Of critical importance to understanding these trends is that they occur in all types of intracellular organisms (e.g., mutualists and pathogens) from across the tree of life (archaea, bacteria, and eukaryotes). Much research has focused on trying to understand the mechanisms underlying these trends for which there are two major hypotheses: the loss of DNA repair genes resulting in subsequent changes in mutation patterns or changes in population genetic parameters that lead to more genetic drift &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040188-b019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040188-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d;. </p><p>As a global explanation, the population genetic forces have more support (e.g., &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040188-b021">21</xref>&#x02013; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040188-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d;), but the issue is far from resolved. One reason for this lack of resolution is that it is usually difficult to reconstruct the early events in the evolution of intracellularity. This insect endosymbiont group has many advantages that have made it a model system for resolving these early events. The addition of the <italic>Baumannia</italic> genome further improves the utility of this group for reasons we detail below. </p><p>One limitation of studies of the evolution of intracellular organisms is that the evolutionary separation between free-living and intracellular species is usually very large. For example, although much can be learned about recent mitochondrial evolution by comparative analysis of mitochondrial genomes, it is not even known what subgroup of <italic>Alphaproteobacteria</italic> contains the closest free-living relative of these organelles. This is because the mitochondrial symbiosis originated billions of years ago. The insect endosymbionts lack this limitation both because their symbioses evolved relatively recently and because of the large diversity of genomes available for the <italic>Gammaproteobacteria.</italic> To make the most use of these benefits, it is imperative to have an accurate picture of the phylogeny of the symbionts. The addition of the <italic>Baumannia</italic> genome is useful in this regard because its proteins appear to be evolving more slowly (as indicated by shorter branch lengths in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040188-g002">Figure 2</xref>A) than those in the other endosymbionts. Having one organism with relatively short branch lengths in this group makes it more likely that the monophyly of the insect endosymbionts in trees is a reflection of their true history and not an artifact of phylogenetic reconstruction known as long-branch attraction. </p><p>The branch-length finding is an example of how <italic>Baumannia</italic> can be considered as a &#x0201c;missing link&#x0201d; in that it is an intermediate in many ways between the other insect endosymbionts and free-living species. This is the case not only for branch length but also for phylogenetic position (it is the deepest branching species), isoelectric point (pI), and G &#x0002b; C content ( <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0040188-t001">Table 1</xref>). By filling in the gaps between the free-living and intracellular species, the <italic>Baumannia</italic> genome should allow better inferences of the early events in the evolution of intracellularity. </p><p><italic>Baumannia</italic> is not intermediate in value between free-living species and other insect endosymbionts for all &#x0201c;intracellular&#x0201d; features. For example, its genome size is smaller than that of some of the other endosymbionts. This is an important finding since the absolute values for many other features are highly correlated, both in this group and in other symbiont groups &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040188-b024">24</xref>&#x0005d;. An example of this is shown for pI and G &#x0002b; C content ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040188-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Another way of looking at this is that the <italic>Baumannia</italic> genome has shrunk more than one might expect based on its other intracellular features. This decoupling of the rates of change of different features can be useful in understanding the patterns of evolution in intracellular species. For example, one explanation for the pattern in <italic>Baumannia</italic> is that although it has experienced more gene loss than some of the other insect endosymbionts, it has maintained the most complete set of DNA repair genes for the group ( <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0040188-t002">Table 2</xref>). This retention of repair functions may have slowed its rate of change in other features, such as sequence change. If true, this suggests that, although the general differences between intracellular and free-living species may be due to population genetic forces, the variation among intracellular species may be due in part to variation in DNA repair. Consistent with this is the finding that species with the longest branch lengths in the trees ( <italic>Wigglesworthia</italic> and <italic>Blochmania,</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040188-g002">Figure 2</xref>A) are those that are missing the mismatch repair genes ( <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0040188-t002">Table 2</xref>). </p><p>The differential loss of repair genes among organisms that share many other genome properties allows the insect endosymbiont group to serve as a model for studying the long-term effects of loss of various repair processes. For example, the consequences for genome evolution of losing <italic>recA</italic> can be examined by comparing <italic>Baumannia</italic> and <italic>Wigglesworthia,</italic> which retain it, to <italic>Buchnera,</italic> which lack it. The same logic can be used to study the effects of the loss of the DNA replication initiation gene <italic>dnaA</italic> which is missing from <italic>Baumannia</italic> (see above), <italic>Wigglesworthia,</italic> and <italic>Blochmannia</italic> &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040188-b018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040188-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d; but is present in the other insect endosymbionts. Although the species without <italic>recA</italic> may be able to survive with little or no recombination, those lacking <italic>dnaA</italic> must make use of alternative initiation pathways. Some alternatives such as pathways based on <italic>priA</italic> and <italic>recA</italic> &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040188-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d; can be ruled out since at least one of these is missing from each of the species missing <italic>dnaA</italic>. The <italic>recBCD</italic> genes may play some role in initiation. This would explain why the <italic>recBCD</italic> genes are present in all insect endosymbionts ( <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0040188-t002">Table 2</xref>) including those missing <italic>recA</italic>, which is required for the &#x0201c;normal&#x0201d; role of <italic>recBCD</italic> in recombination. </p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms Are Abundant in the <italic>Baumannia</italic> Population </title><p>Genetic variation among individuals is both a complication of genome sequencing projects of uncultured species and a valuable source of information about microbial populations. For the <italic>Baumannia</italic> data, we used a stringent search protocol that may have missed some true polymorphisms but should have eliminated variation that was due to sequencing errors or cloning artifacts (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>). In total, we identified 104 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and two insertion-deletion differences (indels) that fit these criteria. Details of the locations and types of polymorphisms are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0040188-t003">Table 3</xref>. </p><p>Since our DNA was isolated from the symbionts of hundreds of hosts, one major question is whether the observed polymorphisms were between symbionts within one host or between hosts. We used polymerase chain reaction surveys of individual insects to address this question.

The same is true for <italic>Buchnera</italic> species but not for <italic>Wigglesworthia</italic> and <italic>Blochmannia</italic>. The functional significance of this difference is unclear. On one hand, lipid A (the lipid component of the LPS) is generally highly toxic to animal cells; thus, LPS may be disadvantageous for endosymbionts and discarded during their evolution. Alternatively, the difference may reflect differences in the packaging of symbionts within the host bacteriocytes. <italic>Buchnera</italic> and <italic>Baumannia</italic> cells are surrounded by host-derived vesicles, while <italic>Wigglesworthia</italic> and <italic>Blochmannia</italic> directly contact the host cytoplasm. </p><p>The findings in regard to sugar metabolism are consistent with <italic>Baumannia</italic> acquiring sugars from its host and using them for energy metabolism. For import, a complete mannose phosphotransferase permease system is present including an Enzyme II <sup>Man</sup> complex, the phosphotransferase system Enzyme I, and histidyl phosphorylatable protein PtsH. Imported sugars could then be fed into glycolysis. However, since the tricarboxylic acid cycle appears to be incomplete, apparently reducing power must come from other sources such as glycolysis itself, a pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, and an <italic>mqo</italic> type malate dehydrogenase. An intact electron transport chain consisting of NADH dehydrogenase I, cytochrome <italic>o</italic> oxidase, and ATP synthase is present. </p><p>The most striking aspects of the metabolism of <italic>Baumannia</italic> relates to what it apparently does and does not do in terms of the synthesis of essential nutrients missing from the hosts' xylem diet. </p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title><italic>Baumannia</italic> Is a Vitamin and Cofactor Machine </title><p>A large fraction of the <italic>Baumannia</italic> genome (83 genes, 13.7&#x00025; of the total) encodes proteins predicted to have roles in pathways for the synthesis of a diverse set of vitamins, cofactors, prosthetic groups and related compounds ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040188-g004">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st001">Table S1</xref>). These include thiamine (vitamin B <sub>1</sub>), riboflavin (vitamin B <sub>2</sub>), niacin (vitamin B <sub>3</sub>), pantothenic acid (vitamin B <sub>5</sub>), pyridoxine (vitamin B <sub>6</sub>), as well as biotin and folic acid. More detail on the pathways and the basis for the predictions is given below. </p><p>For the synthesis of riboflavin, folate, pyridoxal 5&#x02032;-phosphate, and thiamine, complete pathways for de novo synthesis could be identified with <italic>Baumannia</italic>'s ability to produce endogenously important precursors such as ribulose-5-phosphate, phosphoenolpyruvate, pyruvate, dihydroxyacetonephosphate, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, erythrose-4-phosphate, guanosine triphosphate, 5-aminoimidazole ribonucleotide, 5&#x02032;-phosphoribosylglycinamide, and 5,10-methylene-tetrahydrofolate. </p><p>For some compounds, although homologs of enzymes carrying out key steps in other species could not be identified, candidates for alternatives are present suggesting the pathways are complete. For example, the step normally carried out by erythrose 4-phosphate dehydrogenase <italic>(Epd)</italic> in the pyridoxal 5&#x02032;-phosphate pathway might be carried out by glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GapA) as seen in some other species &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040188-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d;. </p><p>There are some compounds for which we could identify homologs of all known genes in biosynthetic pathways. However, some enzymes in these pathways are still unknown in any organism, and thus we could not identify them here. This is true for the pyrimidine phosphatase in the riboflavin pathway and the dihydroneopterin monophosphate dephosphorylase in the folic acid pathway. We believe it is likely that these pathways are complete in <italic>Baumannia</italic> and that, due to its ultracompact gene pool, <italic>Baumannia</italic> provides an ideal opportunity to identify the genes encoding the enzymes for these steps. </p><p>Perhaps most interesting are the pathways for which we could identify genes underlying many downstream steps but for which <italic>Baumannia</italic> would need to import some intermediates to feed those steps. For example, <italic>Baumannia</italic> encodes genes for the last three steps for siroheme synthesis, and the last step of heme O pathway, but candidate genes underlying the upstream steps could not be identified. Thus, <italic>Baumannia</italic> needs to import prophobilinogen and protoheme as substrates for these incomplete pathways. This pattern is particularly apparent in that <italic>Baumannia</italic> appears to be able to synthesize many cofactors from amino acids but is unable to synthesize the amino acid precursors. Examples of such pathways and the amino acid required include thiamin (tyrosine), biotin (alanine), pyridine nucleotides (aspartate), and folate and pyridoxal 5&#x02032;-phosphate (glutamine and glutamate). This suggests that <italic>Baumannia</italic> must import these amino acids. The lack of amino acid biosynthesis pathways also makes it a necessity for <italic>Baumannia</italic> to import 2-ketovaline as a precursor for the synthesis of pantothenate and coenzyme A. </p><p>Due to the diversity of vitamin and cofactor synthesis pathways that are present, we conclude that <italic>Baumannia</italic> is providing its host with these compounds due to their low abundance in its diet. In this respect <italic>Baumannia</italic> is more similar to <italic>Wigglesworthia,</italic> the symbiont of tsetse flies, than to <italic>Buchnera</italic>. </p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Amino Acid Biosynthetic Pathways Are Generally Absent from <italic>Baumannia</italic> and Likely Are Found in Another Organism in the System </title><p>In contrast to what is seen for vitamin and cofactor synthesis, <italic>Baumannia</italic> is predicted to encode a very limited set of amino acid synthesis pathways. The few capabilities that are present include histidine biosynthesis, synthesis of methionine if external homoserine is provided, and the ability to make chorismate but not to use it as substrate for production of aromatic amino acids as in most bacterial species. Except for histidine, no complete pathways for the synthesis of any amino acids essential to the host are present. </p><p>The lack of amino acid synthesis pathways is apparently compensated by an ability to import amino acids from the environment using a general amino acid ABC transporter, an arginine/lysine ABC transporter, a lysine permease, and a proton/sodium-glutamate symport protein, although the gene for the latter is disrupted by one frameshift. The import of amino acids is apparently used not just for making proteins but also for energy metabolism. The latter is evident by the presence of the aspartate ammonia-lyase AspA, which could be used to convert <sc>l</sc>-aspartate to fumarate, which in turn can be fed into the tricarboxylic acid cycle. </p><p>The absence of essential amino acid synthesis pathways from <italic>Baumannia</italic> implies that both the host and <italic>Baumannia</italic> must obtain amino acids from some external source or sources. The sole diet of <named-content content-type="genus-species">H. coagulata</named-content> is xylem sap &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040188-b010">10</xref>&#x0005d;, in which essential amino acids are rare to absent; however, a substantial portion of the nitrogen in xylem occurs in the form of certain nonessential amino acids, including glutamine, aspartic acid, and asparagine (e.g., &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040188-b011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040188-b014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040188-b031">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040188-b032">32</xref>&#x0005d;). The essential amino acid synthesis pathways have not been found in any animal species studied to date, and nutritional studies in insects indicate that these compounds are required nutrients in insects as in mammals. Thus, the most plausible alternative is that another organism that is reliably present in the &#x0201c;ecosystem&#x0201d; of the host body is synthesizing the missing amino acids. </p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Analysis of Leftover Shotgun Sequence Reads Reveals the Presence of Amino Acid Synthesis Genes in Organisms Other than <italic>Baumannia</italic></title><p>The most likely candidate for another organismal source of the amino acid synthesis pathways is <italic>Sulcia,</italic> the other coevolving symbiont found in bacteriomes mentioned above. Although we did not set out to sequence the <italic>Sulcia</italic> genome as part of this project, we realized we might have inadvertently acquired some of it since many sequence reads from the shotgun sequencing did not assemble with the <italic>Baumannia</italic> genome. These reads derived from cells of other organisms that were present in the tissue samples we used to isolate DNA for the <italic>Baumannia</italic> sequencing. An initial search of these sequence reads revealed the presence of homologs of genes with roles in the synthesis of essential amino acids. However, we could not conclude that these reads were from <italic>Sulcia,</italic> since there could have been cells of other organisms in the sample as well. To sort the extra reads into taxonomic bins, we adapted methods we have used to sort sequences from environmental shotgun sequencing projects (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>) and were able to assign non- <italic>Baumannia</italic> sequences to three main groups: host, <italic>Wolbachia</italic> related, and <italic>Sulcia</italic> related. </p><p>The finding of some <italic>Wolbachia</italic> in the sample was not surprising since rRNA surveys have shown that these alphaproteobacterial relatives of Rickettsia are found in many sharpshooters including <italic>H. coagulata.</italic> We note that we did not detect any sequences from the previously sequenced phytopathogen <italic>X. fastidiosa,</italic> which colonizes the surface of the foregut and is not present in the bacteriomes that we used for DNA isolation. In addition, although some of our sequences show high identity to sequences annotated as being from a phytoplasma, we believe this annotation is incorrect. The &#x0201c;phytoplasma&#x0201d; DNA was isolated from the saliva of the leafhopper <named-content content-type="genus-species">Orosius albicinctus</named-content> &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040188-b033">33</xref>&#x0005d;.

Why these sequences appeared in samples from salivary secretions is unclear. </p></sec><sec id="s2h"><title>Amino Acid Synthesis Pathways Are in <italic>Sulcia</italic> and Not Other Organisms in the Sample </title><p>Of the essential amino acid synthesis genes identified in the extra shotgun sequence reads, the vast majority (31 of 32) were assigned to the <italic>Sulcia</italic> bin. In contrast, only one gene ( <italic>argB</italic>) was found in the <italic>Wolbachia</italic> bin and none were found in the host bin. We therefore sought to obtain as much sequence information as possible from the <italic>Sulcia</italic> symbionts in this system. First, we completed the sequence of all plasmid clones for which at least one read had been assigned to the <italic>Sulcia</italic> bin. In addition, we constructed a new library from tissue thought to contain more of the <italic>Sulcia</italic> symbiont than the library used for the initial sequencing. End-sequencing of this library identified some additional <italic>Sulcia-</italic>derived clones, and these, too, were completely sequenced. After conducting another round of assembly and assigning contigs and sequences to taxonomic bins, we were able to assign 146,384 bp of unique sequence to <italic>Sulcia</italic>. In these data, we identified 166 protein-coding genes. A phylogenetic analysis of a concatenated alignment of ribosomal proteins groups this protein set within the Bacteroidetes, thus supporting our assignment of these sequences to <italic>Sulcia</italic> ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040188-g005">Figure 5</xref>). </p><p>Although theoretically we could obtain a complete genome sequence of <italic>Sulcia</italic> by very deep sequencing of the samples we have obtained, this was not practical given limited funds. Nevertheless, analysis of the incomplete genome is quite revealing. First, among the 166 predicted proteins are 31 that underlie steps or whole pathways for the synthesis of amino acids essential for the host ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040188-g004">Figure 4</xref>). These include the complete pathway of threonine biosynthesis and nearly complete pathways for the synthesis of leucine, valine, and isoleucine (the only gene not sampled is <italic>ilvE</italic> encoding the branched chain amino acid aminotransferase). In addition, multiple genes in the pathways for the synthesis of lysine, arginine, and tryptophan are present. We believe it is likely that these pathways are present and that the missing genes are in the unsequenced parts of the genome. </p><p>One question that remains is where <italic>Sulcia</italic> gets all of the nitrogen for these amino acids. One possibility is that it acquires and then converts nitrogenous organic compounds, particularly the nonessential amino acids known to be present in xylem (e.g., &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040188-b014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040188-b032">32</xref>&#x0005d;). Alternatively, it is possible that <italic>Sulcia</italic> assimilates nitrogen from compounds such as ureides or ammonium, which are found in xylem (e.g., &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040188-b014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040188-b032">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040188-b034">34</xref>&#x0005d;). It has been proposed that <italic>X. fastidiosa,</italic> the plant pathogen vectored by <italic>H. coagulata,</italic> makes use of the ammonium in xylem as a nitrogen source &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040188-b035">35</xref>&#x0005d;. Alternatively, <italic>Sulcia</italic> could garner inorganic nitrogen from the host, for which ammonium is a waste product &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040188-b010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040188-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;.

Although some insect genomes encode enzymes that may allow for this (e.g., glutamine synthetase or glutamate synthase (e.g., &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040188-b037">37</xref>&#x0005d;), it is not yet known whether these capabilities are present in sharpshooters. Whatever the source of its nitrogen, the genome analysis indicates that <italic>Sulcia</italic> apparently can make the amino acids required by the host. </p><p>The other abundant organism in our DNA was <italic>Wolbachia,</italic> an unlikely candidate as the source of these compounds. <italic>Wolbachia</italic> cannot be an obligate symbiont of sharpshooters because it infects only some individuals. Screening of individual <named-content content-type="genus-species">H. coagulata</named-content> indicates that some do not contain <italic>Wolbachia</italic> (&#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040188-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;, two of 40 insects were uninfected in our screens); and screening of individuals of the closely related species, <named-content content-type="genus-species">Homalodisca literata</named-content> (a synonym of <named-content content-type="genus-species">H. lacerta</named-content>), revealed no cases of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> infection. Also, although we have sampled only a fraction of the <italic>Wolbachia</italic> genome, the absence of amino acid synthesis pathways is consistent with the complete lack of essential amino acid biosynthesis in any of several sequenced <italic>Wolbachia</italic> genomes (two complete and many incomplete) &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040188-b023">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040188-b038">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040188-b039">39</xref>&#x0005d;. </p><p>We therefore conclude that <italic>Sulcia</italic> is most likely the sole provider of essential amino acids for <italic>H. coagulata.</italic> Thus, this member of the <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic> phylum appears to function in a similar way to <italic>Buchnera</italic> and <italic>Blochmannia</italic> species in the <italic>Gammaproteobacteria</italic>. </p></sec><sec id="s2i"><title><italic>Sulcia</italic> and <italic>Baumannia</italic> Complement Each Other </title><p>We found very few genes in the partial <italic>Sulcia</italic> genome for vitamin or cofactor synthesis.

Thus, in the 146 kb of sequence assigned to <italic>Sulcia,</italic> we have already found many of the core housekeeping types of genes (e.g., 40 ribosomal proteins and ten tRNA synthetases ( <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040188-g006">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st002">Table S2</xref>).

Not only do they appear to provide different resources for the host ( <italic>Sulcia</italic> provides the amino acids and <italic>Baumannia</italic> the vitamins and cofactors) but, based on the current evidence, each does not provide the resources made by the other ( <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0040188-t004">Table 4</xref>). Indeed, the single essential amino acid biosynthetic pathway present in the <italic>Baumannia</italic> genome, that for histidine, is correspondingly the sole essential amino acid pathway with multiple steps for which no genes were detected in <italic>Sulcia</italic>. Thus, although <italic>Baumannia</italic> and the host apparently depend on <italic>Sulcia</italic> for the majority of essential amino acids, <italic>Sulcia</italic> and the host may depend on <italic>Baumannia</italic> for histidine. The complementarity between host and each symbiont extends to mutual dependence between the symbionts, which appear to depend on each other for these required compounds and for intermediates in other metabolic processes. For example, we predict that <italic>Sulcia</italic> can make homoserine, which, as discussed above, could be the substrate for methionine synthesis in <italic>Baumannia</italic>. In addition, the valine pathway in <italic>Sulcia</italic> could be the source of the 2-ketovaline for pantothenate and coenzyme A biosynthesis in <italic>Baumannia</italic>. Exchange of intermediates may be occurring for many aspects of metabolism. In the case of ubiquinone, a key component of the electron transport chain, <italic>Baumannia</italic> lacks genes encoding the needed biosynthetic enzymes and thus likely needs to import ubiquinone. The same appears to be true for menaquinone. Strikingly, even though only four of the 166 proteins in <italic>Sulcia</italic> are predicted to be involved in pathways of cofactor synthesis, two are for production of menaquinone and ubiquinone production, which are among the few cofactors whose synthesis is not carried out by <italic>Baumannia</italic>. </p><p>The coresidence of <italic>Sulcia</italic> and <italic>Baumannia</italic>, presented here from <italic>H. coagulata,</italic> is representative of a symbiotic pair that is distributed in most or all sharpshooters, a xylem-feeding insect group &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040188-b009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040188-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;. Thus, the possibility of metabolic complementarity that is suggested by the genome analyses reflects long coevolution of the three lineages represented by the insects and the two bacteria.

For example, the different organisms must balance their contributions to the shared metabolism through coordinated growth and gene expression, and the mechanisms underlying this integration are not known. Also, these bacterial genomes have undergone major reduction in size while apparently maintaining their complementary capabilities, raising the question of how the steps in genome reduction have been coordinated. The sharpshooters and their obligate bacterial endosymbionts provide a simple model of genomic coevolution, a process that has likely been central in the evolution of most organisms living in stable associations.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s3"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Isolation of DNA for sequencing.</title><p>The material for sequencing was obtained from adults of <named-content content-type="genus-species">H. coagulata</named-content> collected in a lemon orchard in Riverside, California, in June 2001 and June 2004.

DNA was isolated from the filtered material using standard methods &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040188-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;. For the second sample, adults were collected in 2004 from the same lemon orchard as before; in this case, we attempted to increase representation of the <italic>Sulcia</italic> genome by dissecting out the yellow portion of the bacteriome from approximately 200 adults and then processing as for the first sample. </p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Library construction and shotgun sequencing.</title><p>DNA libraries were constructed by shearing the genomic DNA through nebulization, cutting DNA of a particular size out of an agarose gel, and cloning it into the pHOS2 plasmid vector. Then 13,926 sequencing reads were generated from a 3- to 4-kb insert-sized library that was constructed using the first &#x0201c;red bacteriome&#x0201d; DNA sample. In addition, a large insert library (10- to 12-kb inserts) was constructed with DNA purified from the second &#x0201c;yellow bacteriome&#x0201d; DNA sample and 3,396 reads were generated from this library. In order to get more sequences to close the <italic>Baumannia</italic> genome and finish <italic>Sulcia</italic> clones, 2,986 sequencing reads were generated in the closure efforts. </p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Assembly and closure of the <italic>Baumannia</italic> genome. </title><p>The shotgun sequence data were assembled using the TIGR assembler &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040188-b040">40</xref>&#x0005d;, and the genome of <italic>Baumannia</italic> was closed using a combination of primer walking, multiplex PCR, and generation and sequencing of transposon-tagged libraries. Repeats were identified using RepeatFinder &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040188-b041">41</xref>&#x0005d;, and sequence and assembly of the repeats were confirmed using PCRs that spanned the repeat. The final assembly was checked such that every single base is covered by at least two clones and has been sequenced at least once in each direction. The average depth of coverage for the genome is 6.4. A putative origin of replication was identified by analysis of transitions in oligonucleotide skew &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040188-b042">42</xref>&#x0005d;. </p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>Identification and sequence of fragments of the genome of <italic>Sulcia</italic></title><p>Sequence reads from the shotgun sequencing data that did not map to the <italic>Baumannia</italic> genome were processed to sort them into candidate taxonomic groups (bins). First, they were assembled into contigs (although the vast majority of sequences did not assemble). Then each contig was analyzed to assign it to a putative bin using a combination of BLAST searches and phylogenetic trees. All sequences were searched with BLASTN and BLASTX against multiple sequence databases to identify top scoring matches. In addition, the BLASTX search results were used to identify possible proteins encoded in the sequences; these proteins were then used to build phylogenetic trees. The taxonomic identity of the nearest neighbor in these trees was extracted and stored. From these search results, sequences were assigned to taxonomic groupings of as low a taxonomic level as possible (e.g., if a protein grouped within a clade of sequences from insects, it was assigned to an insect bin). Examination of the results revealed that there were three major bins: insect, <italic>Wolbachia,</italic> and <italic>Bacteroidetes.</italic> There were also many sequences that were not readily assignable to one of these bins but could be assigned to higher level groups such as &#x0201c;Bacteria.&#x0201d; Based on rRNA studies and other work, we assumed that all sequences that were assigned to animals were likely from the host, and that all assigned to <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic> were likely from the <italic>Sulcia</italic> symbiont. Thus we refer to these bins as host and <italic>Sulcia,</italic> respectively. </p><p>Initial analysis indicated that there were some genes encoding proteins predicted to be involved in amino acid synthesis in the <italic>Sulcia</italic> bin. In order to get more data from this taxonomic group, we decided to finish sequencing any clones that mapped to this group and that were at the end of contigs. In order to reduce the probability of wasting funds sequencing clones from another organism, we developed more stringent criteria for selecting which of the initial <italic>Sulcia</italic> bin sequences to characterize further. In these criteria, at least one of the following had to be true: (1) part of the contig contained a match of greater than 99&#x00025; identity to the previously sequenced 16S to 23S rDNA of <italic>Sulcia</italic> &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040188-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;; (2) BLASTP searches of translated sequences against all complete microbial genomes gave a best match (based on E-value) to a member of the <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic> phylum; (3) predicted proteins branched with genes from <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic> species in neighbor joining trees; and (4) the sequences were significantly AT biased. For all sequence reads that were assigned to <italic>Sulcia</italic> using these criteria, if they were at the end of a contig, the remainder of the clone was sequenced. </p><p>After this additional sequencing, all sequence reads (including the new reads) that did not map to the <italic>Baumannia</italic> genome were reassembled using the Celera Assembler. From this new assembly, a &#x0201c;final&#x0201d; list of contigs likely to be from <italic>Sulcia</italic> was identified using similar criteria as above: first, the fragment had to have ORFs that either had a best scoring BLAST hit to a sequence in the <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic> phylum or position next to a <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic> gene in neighbor-joining trees of the proteins identified by BLASTP. In addition, GC content had to either be below 40&#x00025; or the fragment had to have greater than 99&#x00025; match for at least 200 bases to the previously sequenced 16S rDNA of the <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic> endosymbiont of the <named-content content-type="genus-species">H. coagulata</named-content>. The low GC content criterion was applied to exclude contamination from free-living bacteria in our DNA sample. </p><p>From the new assemblies, contigs we also reassigned to the <italic>Wolbachia</italic> and host bins. To be considered to be from <italic>Wolbachia,</italic> the contig had to have not been assigned to <italic>Baumannia</italic> or <italic>Sulcia</italic> and had to have a top BLASTX hit to sequences from other <italic>Wolbachia</italic>. In total, 43,079 bp of unique sequence were assigned to <italic>Wolbachia</italic>. Another 120 kb worth of sequences and assemblies could not be assigned conclusively to <italic>Sulcia</italic>, <italic>Wolbachia,</italic> or <italic>Baumannia</italic> but had top BLAST hits to bacterial genes. </p></sec><sec id="s3e"><title>Genome annotation.</title><p>For the <italic>Baumannia</italic> genome, the GLIMMER program was used to identify putative CDSs &#x0005b; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040188-b043">43</xref>&#x0005d;.

We used only positions that did not have variable flanking sites to prevent alignment errors from mistakenly causing us to score a site as polymorphic.
