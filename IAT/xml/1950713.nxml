However, our <italic>in vivo </italic>experiments show that subcutaneous injection of cells overexpressing HIF2&#x003b1; into syngenic mice, leads to the formation of tumour nodules that grow slower than controls, but that are well structured and highly vascularized.

Under normoxia, HIF&#x003b1; are subjected to enzymatic proline hydroxylation that target them for proteasome degradation via the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) ubiquitin E3 ligase complex (for review, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]).</p><p>Both HIFs are overexpressed in many cancer cells and mainly associated with invasiveness, poor prognosis and/or tumour angiogenesis (for review, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]). Experimental studies have however led to discrepant results regarding their role in cancer, pointing to functions varying depending on the cell type. Experiments performed with HIF1&#x003b1;-/- embryonic stem (ES) cells conflictingly revealed that HIF1 may act as a positive regulator of tumour growth, most likely through its activation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] or as a negative regulator, possibly through the stabilization of p53 in hypoxic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In pancreatic cancer, disruption of HIF1 pathway using a dominant negative strategy reduces tumourigenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Opposite results have also been obtained concerning HIF2&#x003b1;. In renal carcinoma cells originating from patients affected by Von Hippel Lindau disease, the abnormal stabilization of HIF2&#x003b1; appears to be directly responsible for tumourigenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In teratomas derived from ES cells carrying an HIF2&#x003b1; knock-in at the HIF1&#x003b1; locus, Covello et al recently observed an increase in both vascular density and proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. In contrast, transfection of HIF2&#x003b1; in a breast cancer cell line inhibits tumour growth, both <italic>in vitro </italic>and <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], while it was recently demonstrated to display pro-apoptotic activities in both rat gliomas and ES cells-derived teratomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>Neuroblastomas are highly vascularized tumours that constitute one of the most frequent solid malignancy of childhood. They arise from immature cells derived from the neural crest and are particularly sensitive to low oxygen tension. Hypoxic treatment of neuroblastoma cells leads to their dedifferentiation towards a neural crest phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], while overexpression of VHL leads to their differentiation into functional neuron-like cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Moreover, hypoxia was associated with an increased invasiveness of these tumours <italic>in vivo </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. These data point to a role of the HIF pathway in the induction of neuroblastoma's tumour phenotype.</p><p>HIF2&#x003b1; plays an important role in the sympathetic nervous system (SNS), both during embryogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and in pathological conditions where it is associated with pheochromocytoma malignancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Hence, it appeared pertinent to assess its role in the SNS-derived model of neuroblastoma C1300. We thus carried out stable transfection of these cells with HIF2&#x003b1; cDNA or with its dominant negative mutant HIF2&#x003b1;(1&#x02013;485) and show that HIF2&#x003b1; displays antiproliferative but pro-angiogenic activities that favour the establishment of neuroblastoma nodules <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Vector constructions</title><p>pCDNA3.1-EPAS1 vector, encoding human HIF2&#x003b1; cDNA (1&#x02013;870) was a gift from S.

N1E-115 cells were transfected using Lipofectin transfection reagent (Invitrogen), as described by the manufacturer. Transfected cells were selected with G-418 (750 &#x003bc;g/ml; Geneticin; Invitrogen) and cloned by a limiting dilution method.</p></sec><sec><title>RT-PCR</title><p>Total RNAs were isolated using the RNeasy extraction kit (Qiagen) and reverse transcribed using random hexamers and the MMLV reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) as described by the manufacturer. PCR reactions were performed as follows: cDNAs were denatured (94&#x000b0;C for 5 min), submitted to 30 cycles of amplification (94&#x000b0;C for 1 min, Tm&#x000b0;C for 1 min and 72&#x000b0;C for 1 min) and to a final elongation (72&#x000b0;C for 10 min).

Membranes were subsequently stripped in NaOH and probed with anti-Akt IgG (1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology) and anti-p70 S6 kinase IgG (1:200, sc-230; Santa Cruz). Immunoreactive bands were visualized by enhanced chemiluminescence, digitized using a 2-dimensional gel scanner, and quantified using Quantity One software (Bio-Rad). For HIF2&#x003b1; western blot, proteins were extracted using the NE-PER Nuclear and Cytoplasmic Extraction Reagents (Pierce). 75 &#x003bc;g of nuclear extracts were blotted on PVDF membranes and probed with the ep190b anti-human HIF2&#x003b1; antibody (1:500; abcam).</p><p>In another set of experiments, the release of VEGF by native and transfected N1E-115 cells under normoxia and reduced oxygen tension was measured using the murine VEGF development ELISA kit (PeproTech) according to the manufacturer's instruction.</p></sec><sec><title>Cell size evaluation</title><p>Cell diameter was evaluated using the Adobe Photoshop software. <italic>In vitro</italic>, cells were seeded at low confluence in 10 cm Petri dishes, in order to avoid the formation of cell aggregates, and grown as described above.

After few hours, medium was replaced and the number of surviving cells (T = 0) evaluated by using a Coulter counter (Beckman Coulter). Further counting was performed after 72, 96, 120 and 144 h. The relative proliferation rate of each clone was assessed by calculating the slope of each proliferation curve. This study was performed four times within few weeks of interval.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>In vivo </italic>tumourigenesis assay</title><p>Sixty five 8 weeks-old, female A/J mice, were purchased from Jackson Laboratory and bred under standard conditions at the Experimental Animal Center of our Research center. Tumours were established in accordance to the guidelines set by the Montreal Heart Institute (MHI) animal care committee and the Canadian Council for Animal Protection. Each mouse was submitted to one injection of 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6 </sup>cells in 500 &#x003bc;l Matrigel (Becton Dickinson). Injections were performed subcutaneously at one site on the back of the mouse. The growth of tumour nodules was then measured bidirectionally every 2 days and tumour volume was calculated by the formula &#x003c0;/6 length<sup>2 </sup>&#x000d7; width. Mice were sacrificed 4 weeks after inoculation. For four HIF2&#x003b1; expressing cells, the MHI ethical committee allowed us to pursue our study up to day 35 post-inoculation.</p></sec><sec><title>Histology and immunohistochemistry</title><p>Tumours were resected and fixed for 24 h at room temperature, either in formalin or, for CD31 immunohistochemistry (IHC), in IHC zinc fixative (BD Biosciences Pharmingen). Samples were then dehydrated and embedded in paraffin and six &#x003bc;m-thick sections were submitted to Masson's trichrome staining. Briefly, after treating tissue sections with Bouin's solution to intensify the final coloration, nuclei were stained with Weigert's iron hematoxylin, and cytoplasm and muscle with Beibrich scarlet-acid fuchsin. After treatment with phosphotungstic and phosphomolybdic acid, collagen was demonstrated by staining with aniline blue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>Immunohistochemistry was performed as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] with a rat anti-mouse CD31 (PECAM-1) monoclonal IgG (MEC13.3, BD Biosciences Pharmingen), a rabbit polyclonal anti-proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) IgG (FL-261, Santa Cruz Biotechnology), or an anti-cleaved caspase-3 (Cell signaling technology).</p></sec><sec><title>Determination of tumour vessel density</title><p>The number of blood vessels was quantified on Masson's trichrome stained sections.

To better characterize these cells, we performed RT-PCR experiments to seek for the expression of genes of interest (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>). We observed that N1E-115 cells express both HIF1&#x003b1; and HIF2&#x003b1;, their common target genes VEGF and adrenomedullin as well as several neuroblastoma classical markers including neuropilin-1, neuronal-specific enolase, Id2 and chromogranin A.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Characterization of native and transfected N1E-115 cells</bold>. a) Expression of HIF1&#x003b1;, HIF2&#x003b1;, VEGF, Neuropilin-1 (NRP-1), adrenomedullin (ADM), neuronal-specific enolase (NSE), Id2 and Chromogranin A (CgA) as well as HIF2&#x003b1; endothelial-specific targets VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2 and Tie2 in N1E-115 cells and mouse kidney cDNAs.

Western blot using a specific anti-human HIF2&#x003b1; antibody confirmed the nuclear presence of the wild-type protein in E1 and E2 clones. d) Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) expression was assessed by western blot and e) VEGF protein expression quantified by ELISA in duplicate 21% or 4% O<sub>2 </sub>atmosphere.

Upper asterisks indicate significance between 21% and 4% O<sub>2 </sub>for each clone. f) Western blot evaluation of HIF1&#x003b1; levels revealed no variation between the different cell clones in both 21% and 4% O<sub>2</sub>.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2407-7-139-1"/></fig><p>We then stably transfected N1E-115 cells with plasmids encoding human HIF2&#x003b1; or its dominant negative mutant (DN). HIF2&#x003b1; DN (namely HIF2&#x003b1;(1&#x02013;485)) comprises the DNA binding domain and the HLH-PAS dimerization domains, but lacks both transactivation domains (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1b</xref>). All commercially available anti-HIF2&#x003b1; antibodies target the C-terminus of the protein, which happens to be deleted in HIF2&#x003b1;(1&#x02013;485). Screening for transfectants was thus performed by RT-PCR using primers specific to the human HIF2&#x003b1; sequence (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1c</xref>, upper panel). To avoid unspecific responses due to clonal selection, we selected two clones expressing HIF2&#x003b1; (E1 and E2) and two clones expressing HIF2&#x003b1;(1&#x02013;485) (DN5 and DN8). Western blot experiments using a specific anti-human HIF2&#x003b1; antibody confirmed the nuclear expression of the transfected construct in HIF2&#x003b1; clones (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1c</xref>, lower panel). Untransfected cells (NT) or cells transfected with the empty pCDNA3.1 vector were used as controls (C).</p><p>To confirm the activity of HIF2&#x003b1; and HIF2&#x003b1;(1&#x02013;485) exogenous proteins, we studied the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), a known HIF2&#x003b1; target gene in the sympathetic nervous system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. We observed an increase in TH protein expression in HIF2&#x003b1; clones, and a reduction in HIF2&#x003b1;(1&#x02013;485) compared to control cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1d</xref>). We next incubated the cells in normoxia (21% O<sub>2</sub>) or in low oxygen tension (4% O<sub>2</sub>) for 6 h and evaluated the release of VEGF by ELISA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1e</xref>). In controls cells, we confirmed that VEGF expression was indeed induced, although moderately, in response to decreased oxygen tension (p = 0,04). As expected, we noted a marked increase in VEGF levels in both E1 and E2 clones, in normoxia (161% (p = 0,017) and 178% (p = 0,012) increase respectively as compared to control cells) and in 4% O<sub>2 </sub>(117% (p = 0,004) and 272% (p &#x0003c; 0,001) increase respectively). In contrast, VEGF protein concentration was not modified in DN5 and DN8 clones in normoxia compared to control cells, while its hypoxic induction was repressed in both clones. Western blot evaluation of HIF1&#x003b1; protein levels confirmed that the differences observed were not due to a deregulation of HIF1&#x003b1; protein expression, but attributable to HIF2&#x003b1; transfections (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1f</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Effect of HIF2&#x003b1; on neuroblastoma cell phenotype</title><p>Hypoxia induces an immature phenotype of neuroblastoma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], while inhibition of the HIF pathway by VHL overexpression mediates differentiation toward a neuron-like morphology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. We searched for such modifications in HIF2&#x003b1; and HIF2&#x003b1;(1&#x02013;485) clones, but could not detect any change in the typical cell shape nor in the number of neuronal extension (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref>). To confirm this observation, we studied the expression of Id2 and CgA markers, which are respectively induced and downregulated during hypoxia-mediated neuroblastoma dedifferentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].

At day 24, the volume of HIF2&#x003b1; nodules was 45% inferior to that of control tumours (p = 0.001). However, from day 24 onward, the growth curve of HIF2&#x003b1; cells displayed a marked acceleration. We thus extended the evaluation period for four HIF2&#x003b1; tumours.

First, they did grow slightly faster than control cells, to reach a maximal 22% volume increase at day 19 (p = 0.058). From day 19 onward, this divergence however diminished and at day 28, there was no distinction between control and HIF2&#x003b1;(1&#x02013;485) tumours volumes.</p><p>In an attempt to clarify this rather complex <italic>in vivo </italic>effect of HIF2&#x003b1; on neuroblastoma growth, we removed tumours at days 19 (just before the growth acceleration of HIF2&#x003b1; nodules) and 28 for controls and HIF2&#x003b1;(1&#x02013;485) cells and at days 19, 28 and 35 for HIF2&#x003b1; nodules. Macroscopic examination revealed that 28-days HIF2&#x003b1;(1&#x02013;485) tumours were pale and highly necrotic compared to controls, whereas equivalent HIF2&#x003b1; tumours (obtained at day 35) appeared particularly dense and red coloured (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5a</xref>). These observations were confirmed by histological observation of Masson's trichrome stained sections. Massive necrosis was observed in HIF2&#x003b1;(1&#x02013;485) tumours as compared to controls, while HIF2&#x003b1; nodules presented a much-limited number of necrotic regions (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5b</xref>). At day 19, cell proliferation revealed by proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) immunohistochemistry did not show any difference between the 3 tumour types, which were all actively proliferating (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5C</xref> insets). In contrast, at later stages, we observed that within healthy-looking areas of tumours, the number of proliferating cells was markedly increased in both 28- and 35-days HIF2&#x003b1; nodules compared to controls. In contrast, there was almost no PCNA staining in cells expressing the HIF2&#x003b1; DN (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5c</xref>). This observation does suggest that 28-day HIF2&#x003b1;(1&#x02013;485) tumours were most probably entering a regression process, while their equivalent 35-day HIF2&#x003b1; counterparts were particularly proliferating. Finally, as HIFs have been described to induce or repress apoptosis, depending on the cell type, we studied the number of cleaved caspase-3 positive cells, outside of the large necrotic areas. In all tumours studied we observed isolated apoptotic cells as well as several areas presenting an increased density of positive cells, but we were unable to use these criteria to discriminate between control, HIF2&#x003b1; and HIF2&#x003b1;(1&#x02013;485) tumours (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5d</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>HIF2&#x003b1; promotes tumour angiogenesis <italic>in vivo</italic></title><p>We hypothesized that the delayed growth of HIF2&#x003b1; tumours and the simultaneous necrosis of fast-growing HIF2&#x003b1;(1&#x02013;485) nodules could be respectively imputable to an increase and a defect in the angiogenic process. We performed immunohistochemistry analyses to detect the endothelial marker PECAM/CD31, which highlighted a marked reduction in the vascularization of HIF2&#x003b1;(1&#x02013;485) expressing tumours and an amplification of angiogenesis in HIF2&#x003b1; ones (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6a</xref>). Quantification of blood vessels (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6c</xref>) within healthy regions of each tumour type revealed that vascular density was markedly increased in HIF2&#x003b1; tumours compared to controls nodules (96% increase at day 19, p = 0.05, and 63% increase at day 28, p = 0.006). In contrast, although angiogenesis was comparable between HIF2&#x003b1;(1&#x02013;485) nodules and control ones at day 19, it then diminished in HIF2&#x003b1;(1&#x02013;485) to reach a 54% decrease in the number of blood vessels compared to control tumours at day 28 (p = 0.001).</p><fig position="float" id="F6"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p><bold>HIF2&#x003b1; promotes neuroblastoma angiogenesis</bold>. a) Positive staining of endothelial cells in tumours was revealed by PECAM/CD31 immunohistochemistry and b) by Masson's trichrome staining of tumour sections.

However, we also demonstrate that <italic>in vivo</italic>, its antiproliferation function acts in combination with an amplification of the angiogenic process to promote the establishment of well-structured neuroblastoma nodules.</p><p>To evaluate the role of HIF2&#x003b1; in neuroblastoma, we overexpressed its native form or inactivated its function using a DN strategy. We used the well-characterized C-terminal deletion mutant HIF2&#x003b1;(1&#x02013;485), which forms a heterodimer with ARNT, binds to the hypoxia-responsive element (HRE) sequence but lacks the ability to transactivate HRE-driven transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. In light of the parameters studied, we observed reproducible and opposite effects of HIF2&#x003b1; and HIF2&#x003b1;(1&#x02013;485) respectively, and equivalent results were obtained with two independent clones of each transfectant. These observations strongly argue for the efficiency and the specificity of this approach. However, it is worth noting that HIF2&#x003b1;(1&#x02013;485) may also prevent HIF1&#x003b1;-mediated transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. In our model, we thus cannot exclude that HIF2&#x003b1;(1&#x02013;485) effects may also be partly due to HIF1&#x003b1; inhibition.</p><p>We observed a marked effect of HIF2&#x003b1; on the modulation of cell size, which was quantified <italic>in vitro </italic>as well as on histological sections of tumour nodules. The impact of this observation is still unclear, and to the best of our knowledge, such an induction of neuroblastoma cell hypertrophy has never been reported. Interestingly, cellular hypertrophy has been associated with cell cycle arrest in mesangial or vascular smooth muscle cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. HIF2&#x003b1; enlarged cells also displayed a reduced proliferating rate associated with a diminution in p42/44 MAPK phosphorylation, while proliferation and phospho-p42/44 were increased in small HIF2&#x003b1;(1&#x02013;485) cells. Although this is the first report of an antiproliferative role of HIF2&#x003b1;, similar activities of HIF1&#x003b1; have already been described in several cells types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Consequently, these <italic>in vitro </italic>data led us to conclude that HIF2&#x003b1; would present antitumoral activities in neuroblastoma, as previously proposed in breast cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and gliomas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Our <italic>in vivo </italic>observations led us to reconsider this initial assumption.</p><p>We indeed show that overexpression of HIF2&#x003b1; leads to a delayed growth of neuroblastoma nodules, characterized by a well-organized structure and a homogeneous histology 5 weeks after inoculation. In contrast, despite an apparent acceleration in tumour growth, 4 week-old HIF2&#x003b1;(1&#x02013;485) neuroblastomas present extensive necrosis associated with a marked reduction in the number of proliferating cells within the apparently healthy tumour territories. Due to ethical restriction, we have not studied HIF2&#x003b1;(1&#x02013;485) tumours beyond this 28-day period. The histological analysis of these tissues, together with the PCNA immunohistochemistry data, were however suggestive of a forthcoming regression, or at least growth arrest, of neuroblastomas expressing HIF2&#x003b1; DN. Hence, the antiproliferative role of HIF2&#x003b1; appears to allow the favourable formation of well-organized tumour nodules instead of reducing neuroblastoma tumourigenesis, as initially assumed. These findings confirm the complexity of HIF2&#x003b1; activity in cancer, which appears to be highly variable depending on the cell-type. In gliomas, Acker et al. observed a comparable negative effect of HIF2&#x003b1; on tumour growth, but an exact opposite phenotype on histology, with increased necrosis in HIF2&#x003b1; tumours and the presence of micronecrotic areas in HIF2&#x003b1;-DN-expressing ones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>Finally, we observed that HIF2&#x003b1; transfected cells led to the formation of particularly vascularized tumours. In contrast, we observed that there was a clear defect in the long-term angiogenic progression within neuroblastomas formed by HIF2&#x003b1; (1&#x02013;485) cells. These tumours were able to initiate a vascularization process, but after four weeks of growth, they presented a marked reduction in vascular density, which could be expected to be responsible for the growth arrest and the important necrosis we observed. The pro-angiogenic role of HIF2&#x003b1; has been established <italic>in vivo </italic>during embryogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] and in a wound healing assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. In pathological angiogenesis such a role has been suggested by a wealth of expression studies performed on tissue sections, but remained to be clarified in experimental tumour angiogenesis. Recently, discrepant results have been obtained in two models of ES-cells-derived teratomas, demonstrating a positive effect of HIF2&#x003b1; on vascular density [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], or an increase in vessel diameter but no modification of blood vessel density [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Our results reveal a pro-angiogenic function of HIF2&#x003b1; by increasing blood vessel density in neuroblastoma, probably mediated by VEGF overexpression. The long-term anti-angiogenic effect of HIF2&#x003b1;(1&#x02013;485) demonstrates that this transcription factor's endogenous activity is required for an optimal vascularization of such tumours, putatively by improving the integrity and maintenance of the vascular network. These data support a very recently published study, which reported that high HIF2&#x003b1; protein levels were correlated with advanced clinical stage and high VEGF expression and predicted poor prognosis in a clinical neuroblastoma material [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, this study confirms the cell-type-dependent heterogeneity of HIF2&#x003b1; 's function in cancer and reveals its unexpected antiproliferative role in the N1E-115 neuroblastoma cell line. Instead of inhibiting cancer progression, this function seems to act in combination with a pro-angiogenic activity of this transcription factor to favour the establishment of appropriately fed, well oxygenized, strong and thus potentially aggressive tumours. These complementary functions, acting together, thus emphasize a favourable role of HIF2&#x003b1; in neuroblastoma tumourigenesis by providing sustained tumour growth, albeit at a slower rate.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>JF conceived the study, performed most experiments and wrote the manuscript.
