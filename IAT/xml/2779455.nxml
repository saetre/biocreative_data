While it was previously demonstrated that poisoned Top1 and Top2&#x003b2; are subject to proteasomal degradation, this phenomena was not demonstrated for Top2&#x003b1;.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>We show here that Top2&#x003b1; is subject to drug induced proteasomal degradation as well, although at a lower rate than Top2&#x003b2;. Using an siRNA screen we identified Bmi1 and Ring1A as subunits of an E3 ubiquitin ligase involved in this process. We show that silencing of Bmi1 inhibits drug-induced Top2&#x003b1; degradation, increases the persistence of Top2&#x003b1;-DNA cleavage complex, and increases Top2 drug efficacy. The Bmi1/Ring1A ligase ubiquitinates Top2&#x003b1; <italic>in-vitro</italic> and cellular overexpression of Bmi1 increases drug induced Top2&#x003b1; ubiquitination. A small-molecular weight compound, identified in a screen for inhibitors of Bmi1/Ring1A ubiquitination activity, also prevents Top2&#x003b1; ubiquitination and drug-induced Top2&#x003b1; degradation. This ubiquitination inhibitor increases the efficacy of topoisomerase 2 poisons in a synergistic manner.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>The discovery that poisoned Top2&#x003b1; is undergoing proteasomal degradation combined with the involvement of Bmi1/Ring1A, allowed us to identify a small molecule that inhibits the degradation process. The Bmi1/Ring1A inhibitor sensitizes cells to Top2 drugs, suggesting that this type of drug combination will have a beneficial therapeutic outcome. As Bmi1 is also a known oncogene, elevated in numerous types of cancer, the identified Bmi1/Ring1A ubiquitin ligase inhibitors can also be potentially used to directly target the oncogenic properties of Bmi1.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Anticancer drugs targeting topoisomerases (Top) are some of the most widely used chemotherapeutic agents. These drugs are type specific; they target either Top1 or Top2&#x003b1; and Top2&#x003b2;. The Top2 poisons (<italic>e.g.</italic> Etoposide, Teniposide (VM26) and Doxorubicin) increase the steady state levels of an intermediate state of the reaction, producing a Top2-DNA cleavage complex comprised of Top2 covalently bound to a double strand DNA break <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008104-Holden1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. Eventually the Top2-DNA cleavage complex forms cytotoxic DNA lesions that trigger cell cycle arrest and cell death. Top2 poisons convert the enzyme into a DNA damaging agent with a stochiometric relationship, one DNA double strand break for every drug molecule bound to a Top2 enzyme. Thus sensitivity to Top2 poisons is dependent on high levels of Top2-DNA cleavage complexes. Moreover, the efficacy of Top2-targeted agents reflects the persistence of drug-induced cleavage complexes in cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008104-Bandele1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Proteasomal degradation of Top2 is one of the mechanisms that decrease the persistence of drug-Top2-DNA complex thus contributing to the emergence of drug resistance and reduced efficacy. While Top2&#x003b2; was shown to be specifically degraded following treatment with Top2 drugs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008104-Mao1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008104-Xiao1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, physiological conditions, such as glucose deprivation and hypoxia, have been shown to induce degradation of Top2&#x003b1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008104-Brown1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref> leading to decreased Top2&#x003b1; levels, rendering cells resistant to Top2-targeted drugs such as etoposide and doxorubicin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008104-Yun1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Hence, inhibition of ubiquitin-dependent degradation of topoisomerases may improve long-term therapeutic efficacy of topoisomerase-targeted drugs. Further support for a degradation based resistance mechanism is obtained from the fact that proteasome inhibition circumvents solid tumor resistance to Top2-directed drugs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008104-Ogiso1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Inhibition of the E3 ubiquitin ligase that directs the drug-Top-DNA complex for degradation should stabilize the cleavage complex in a similar manner and concomitantly increase drug-induced efficacy. Inhibiting a specific E3 ligase is expected to be superior to inhibiting the proteasome as it is expected to have much lower side effects.</p><p>Here we demonstrate first that Top2&#x003b1;, similar to Top2&#x003b2;, is degraded following a treatment with the Top2 drug teniposide (VM26) although at a slower rate then Top2&#x003b2;. We describe the identification of Bmi1 and Ring1A as subunits of an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that is involved in both, drug-induced Top2&#x003b1; degradation and low-glucose induced Top2&#x003b1; degradation. Silencing of either Bmi1 or Ring1A by RNAi reduces drug-induced Top2&#x003b1; degradation and correlates with increased drug efficacy in various cell-lines, while overexpression of Bmi1 induces increased ubiquitination of Top2&#x003b1;. A purified complex formed by Bmi1 and Ring1A is shown to ubiquitinate immunopurified Top2&#x003b1;. We describe a high-throughput assay for the discovery of small-molecule inhibitors of Bmi1/Ring1A. A compound discovered using this assay prevents degradation of Top2&#x003b1; induced by a Top2 drug and increases the efficacy of Top2 drugs in a synergistic manner.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Reagents and Antibodies</title><p>All cell-lines were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC).

In contrast, in Bmi1 knockdown cells the Top2&#x003b1;-DNA complex is stabilized, as it is found bound to genomic DNA also after 6 hours of drug treatment.

For that purpose we produced tagged recombinant Ring1A and Bmi1 proteins and tested their activity, either separately or together, in a cell-free auto-ubiquitination assay with a panel of different E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes. Ubiquitination activity is assessed by monitoring the increase in molecular weight of the ubiquitinated proteins, using tag-directed antibodies. When each protein is assayed alone, Ring1A acts preferentially with UbcH5a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008104-g006">Fig. 6A</xref> upper panel), while Bmi1 is inactive with all the E2 enzymes tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008104-g006">Fig. 6A</xref> lower panel). When Ring1A and Bmi1 are combined and assayed together, Bmi1 is highly ubiquitinated in the presence of UbcH5a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008104-g006">Fig. 6B</xref> lower panel) whereas ubiquitination of Ring1A is very weak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008104-g006">Fig. 6B</xref> upper panel). Weak Bmi1 ubiquitination is also seen with UbcH2, UbcH5b, UbcH5c and UbcH6.

The results of the HTRF<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>-based assay are in agreement with the gel-based assay showing that the Bmi1-Ring1A complex has a preference for UbcH5a as an E2.

To distinguish between these two possibilities we carried the HTRF<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>-based ubiquitin-chain elongation assay with wild-type or L20A RING domain mutant of Bmi1 and either wild-type Ring1A or a I50A RING domain mutant of Ring1A. The L20A and I50A point mutations in Bmi1 and Ring1A respectively, are similar to mutations in other RING proteins where it was demonstrated to prevent binding to the E2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008104-Zheng1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008104-Albert1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008104-Brzovic1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, but does not interfere with functional dimerization with a partner RING domain protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008104-BenSaadon1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>.

When Bmi1 is combined with the I50A Ring1A mutant protein, the complex is inactive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008104-g006">Fig. 6D</xref>), indicating that binding of Ring1A is not sufficient for Bmi1 to become active. The activity of Bmi1(L20A)-Ring1A complex was comparable to the activity of wild-types Bmi1-Ring1A complex suggesting that the E2 binding site on Bmi1 is not contributing to the activity. Hence, we conclude that Bmi1 and Ring1A form an active heterodimeric E3 ubiquitin ligase, where Ring1A is the active component and Bmi1 greatly enhances its activity.</p><p>To determine the effect of Bmi1 and Ring1A on Top2&#x003b1; ubiquitination in cells we transfected HeLa cells with Bmi1 and Ring1A separately or together.

We show that overexpression of Bmi1 is sufficient to increase the ubiquitination of Top2&#x003b1;, while Ring1A overexpression does not contribute additional ubiquitination. This suggests that Bmi1 is the limiting factor in Top2&#x003b1; ubiquitination in HeLa cells and is in agreement with various reports showing that Bmi1 is a key factor in the PRC1.</p><fig id="pone-0008104-g007" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0008104.g007</object-id><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>Bmi1 and Ring1A bind and ubiquitinate Top2&#x003b1;.</title><p>A.

Top2&#x003b1; was immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag beads and attached proteins were detected by immuno-blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008104-g007">Fig. 7B</xref>). Both Bmi1 and Ring1A are associated with Top2&#x003b1; in this cell-free binding assay, either when each one was added separately or when combined together. To test if Top2&#x003b1; is a direct ubiquitination target of Ring1A-Bmi1, we used Flag-tagged Top2&#x003b1; immunopurified from transfected HeLa cells as a substrate in a cell-free ubiquitination assay containing biotin-tagged ubiquitin, UbcH5a and Bmi1/Ring1A.

These results together with the stabilization effect of Bmi1 and Ring1A siRNAs on drug-induced Top2&#x003b1; degradation, suggest that the Bmi1/Ring1A complex may function as a Top2&#x003b1; ubiquitin ligase.</p></sec><sec id="s3h"><title>Identification of Bmi1/Ring1A Inhibitors</title><p>After identifying Bmi1/Ring1A, as an E3 ligase involved in drug-induced Top2&#x003b1; degradation, we initiated a campaign for the identification of small-molecule inhibitors of its ubiquitination activity. The assumption is that such inhibitors will diminish proteasomal degradation of Top2&#x003b1; thus increasing the potency of Top2 directed drugs. For this purpose, we modified the HTRF<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>-based Bmi1/Ring1A ubiquitination assay into high throughput format. Using this assay we screened a library of 56,000 diverse small-molecule compounds and identified several chemical structural families that inhibit Bmi1/Ring1A ubiquitination activity. Initial hits were tested using several cell-free filtering assays, designed to eliminate assay artifacts and inhibitors of other components in the reaction. Specifically we set up assays for measuring E1 dependent ubiquitin activation and E2 dependent ubiquitin conjugation.

This led us to test whether PRT4165 affects Bmi1 localization in cells. Staining of cells with Bmi1 antibodies, results in a typical punctate appearance of endogenous Bmi1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008104-g009">Figure 9C</xref>). We found that a 3 hour treatment with 50 &#x000b5;M PRT4165 in A375 cells or 100 &#x000b5;M in HeLa cells, leads to disappearance of the speckled staining in the nuclei and appearance of Bmi1 also in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008104-g009">Figure 9C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3j"><title>PRT4165 Synergistically Increases Potency of Top2 Drugs</title><p>Next we set to test whether prevention of drug-induced Top2&#x003b1; degradation by PRT4165 is also translated into increased Top2 drug efficacy in these cells. Towards that end, we determined the effect of PRT4165 on the LD50 of VM26 in A549 lung cancer and A375 melanoma cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008104-g010">Fig. 10A</xref>). Increasing concentrations of PRT4165 systematically improves the efficacy of VM26 in a dose-dependent manner. In A549 lung cancer cells (top panel) the LD50 of VM26 is reduced ten-fold from 3.1 &#x000b5;M when treated alone to 0.3 &#x000b5;M when VM26 is combined with 33 &#x000b5;M of PRT4165. In A375 melanoma cells (bottom panel) PRT4165 is even more effective, a similar ten-fold increase in VM26 efficacy is observed at a concentration of 5.5 &#x000b5;M PRT4165. Isobolgram analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008104-g010">Fig. 10B</xref>) demonstrates that the combined toxicity of PRT4165 and VM26 is synergistic (top panel) whereas the combined effect of PRT4165 with another commonly used cancer drug such as Taxol, that does not target topoisomerases, is additive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0008104-g010">Fig. 10B</xref>, bottom panel).

We show that Top2&#x003b1; is an ubiquitination target of Bmi1/Ring1A in a cell free system and that Bmi1 overexpression increases drug-induced Top2&#x003b1; ubiquitination in cells. Recently it was reported that the polycomb complex remains bound to DNA during DNA replication <italic>in vitro</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008104-Francis1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. This localizes the polycomb complex at the right place and time to be a direct E3 ligase of Top2&#x003b1; when it is within the Top-DNA cleavage complex. However, whether or not Top2&#x003b1; is indeed a direct ubiquitination target of Bmi1/Ring1A also in cells still has to be shown by additional studies. Two other E3 ubiquitin ligases, Mdm2 and Brca1, were implicated in the ubiquitination and degradation of Top2&#x003b1;. Mdm2 binds to Top2&#x003b1; and mediates its ubiquitination and subsequent degradation following etoposide treatment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008104-Nayak1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. Cells harboring a single nucleotide polymorphism that increase the expression of Mdm2 were found to be about ten-fold more resistance to Top2 poisons whereas silencing of Mdm2 increased sensitivity, although to a lesser extent. Several pieces of evidence connect Brca1 to Top2&#x003b1; ubiquitination. It was shown that Brca1 binds and ubiquitinates Top2&#x003b1; and this ubiquitination increases the DNA decatenation activity of Top2&#x003b1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008104-Lou1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. In another report it was suggested that retinoblastoma protein (pRb) facilitates processing and repair of Top2-cleavable complexes by recruiting Brca1 to Top2&#x003b1; at the damaged site <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008104-Xiao2">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. Oxidative stress also leads to Brca1 and pRb-dependent ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of Top2&#x003b1; in some cell lines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008104-Shinagawa1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref>. The last two reports suggest that pRb serves as an adaptor protein to recruit Brca1 (and other proteins) involved in Top2&#x003b1; ubiquitination. Interestingly, pRb is also localized in the PcG bodies and interacts with Ring1A <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008104-Dahiya1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. The exact roles filled by Mdm2, Brca1 and Bmi1/Ring1A, in the ubiquitination and degradation of Top2&#x003b1; is yet to be determined.</p><p>Self-ubiquitination is a mechanism that serves some E3-ligases as a mean to control their own level. Inhibiting Bmi1/Ring1A ubiquitination activity may raise the concern that this may lead to increased cellular levels of these oncogenic proteins. Prior to initiating the screen for inhibitors, we have noticed that co-expression of Bmi1 and Ring1A results in higher expression levels of both proteins (unpublished results). These results imply that the self-ubiquitination activity of Bmi1/Ring1A is not serving as a degradation signal, similar to the reported results for Bmi1 and Ring1B <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008104-BenSaadon1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. In agreement with this, it turns out, that the identified inhibitor PRT4165 does not increase the observed cellular levels of either Bmi1 or Ring1A (data not shown). However, application of PRT4165 does modify the cellular localization of Bmi1, from discrete PcG bodies within the nucleolus to disperse nuclear and even cytoplasmic localization. How the inhibitor leads to miss-localization of Bmi1 and whether it affects the oncogenic properties of Bmi1 remains to be explored.</p><p>Previous publications have demonstrated ubiquitination activity of Ring1A <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008104-Buchwald1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008104-Wei1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref> however this activity was very weak and the main ubiquitination activity of the PRC1 complex was attributed to Ring1B. Here we demonstrated a robust ubiquitination activity of Ring1A when it is in a complex with Bmi1. It appears that the contribution of Bmi1 does not depend on the integrity of its E2 binding site. An activation role of Bmi1 was also demonstrated in the case of Ring1B-dependent H2A ubiquitination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008104-Cao1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008104-BenSaadon1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008104-Wei1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>. Bmi1 has a key role in the function of the PRC1 complex as was reflected by its overexpression in many different tumors. In agreement, we show that Bmi1 overexpression, but not Ring1A overexpression, increases drug-induced Top2&#x003b1; ubiquitination. Taken together it may suggest that a key role of Bmi1 in the PRC1 complex is to activate the ubiquitination activity of PRC1 in a Ring1A or a Ring1B-dependent manner. In addition it may suggest a modular mode of action, where the level of activity is determined by the expression of Bmi1, and the relative levels of the other RING-domain subunits influence the target selectivity.</p><p>Bmi1 is a key component of PRC1 regulating chromatin remodeling and gene expression pathways essential for self-renewal of stem cells and cancer stem cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008104-Lessard1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008104-Park1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008104-Molofsky1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008104-Iwama1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>.

Moreover, silencing of Bmi1 by siRNA leads to the death of cancer cells specifically <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008104-Liu1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, suggesting that its activity is also essential for viability during the malignant stage. Ring1A has been also shown to have tumorogenic properties as its overexpression leads to anchorage-independent growth and tumor induction in athymic mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008104-Satijn1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, however its expression does not seem to be upregulated in tumors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008104-SanchezBeato1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>.

The PRC1 complex with its core activity of an ubiquitin ligase, cooperates with the PRC2 complex, with a core activity of histone methyltransferase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008104-Simon1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref> and association with DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008104-Vire1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. A key component in the PRC2 complex is EZH2 histone methylase and similar to Bmi1, it is also elevated in various cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008104-Simon1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. PRC1 and PRC2 act together to epigenetically silence target genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008104-Simon2">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>, many of them with pro-differentiation and anti-proliferative function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008104-Bracken1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>. The exact role of the different polycomb complexes, the relation between the methylation and ubiquitination and the sequence of events are under extensive research by many labs. However, the picture that emerges is that these complexes and their activities play a crucial role in the initiation and maintenance of cancer and stem cell phenotype of cancer cells. Hence, the ubiquitination and methylation activities of the polycomb complexes appear as promising therapeutic targets for cancer therapy and moreover, for targeting cancer-stem-cell self-renewal. Therefore, the effect of PRT4165 on the PRC1-repressed genes and the self-renewal capabilities of cancer stem cells would be highly relevant to its therapeutic potential.</p><p>Inhibiting Bmi1/Ring1A is expected to increase the persistence of Top2&#x003b1;-DNA cleavage complex, by preventing its proteasomal degradation, leading to increased potency of Top2 drugs. Such a combination therapy can be beneficial, as increasing the potency of such a drug by this mechanism, can either achieve better eradication of cancer cells using the same amount of drug, or allow the use of lower doses. This can reduce some of the side effects associated with these cytotoxic drugs. As Top2&#x003b1; is expressed only in proliferating cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0008104-Wang2">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref> and is overexpressed in many cancer cells, a combination therapy of an anthracycline and a Bmi1/Ring1A inhibitor, is expected to achieve similar specific killing of cancer cells through increased poisoning of Top2&#x003b1;, with reduced unwanted side effects.</p><p>The ubiquitin system of protein modification is a crucial mechanism involved in almost every aspect of cellular processes. The evidences for the involvement of the ubiquitin system in human diseases are rapidly accumulating reflecting the central role of the system in cellular function. However, the concept that E3 ubiquitin ligases are druggable targets is still to be demonstrated. The complexity of the assays and the lack of classic enzymatic activity make the task even more challenging. Bmi1 represents one of the attractive potential targets in the ubiquitin system, either for a stand-alone therapy or as we show here, for combination therapy with Top2 poisons.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0008104.s001"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p>siRNA used in the study</p><p>(0.02 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0008104.s001.doc" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0008104.s002"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>Dependence of Bmi1-Ring1A self-ubiquitination on concentration of various E2 conjugating enzymes.
