Genes involved in energy metabolism are likely to be central to heat and cold tolerance. To test the hypothesis that climate shaped variation in metabolism genes in humans, we used a bioinformatics approach based on network theory to select 82 candidate genes for common metabolic disorders. We genotyped 873 tag SNPs in these genes in 54 worldwide populations (including the 52 in the Human Genome Diversity Project panel) and found correlations with climate variables using rank correlation analysis and a newly developed method termed Bayesian geographic analysis. In addition, we genotyped 210 carefully matched control SNPs to provide an empirical null distribution for spatial patterns of allele frequency due to population history alone. For nearly all climate variables, we found an excess of genic SNPs in the tail of the distributions of the test statistics compared to the control SNPs, implying that metabolic genes as a group show signals of spatially varying selection. Among our strongest signals were several SNPs (e.g., <italic>LEPR</italic> R109K, <italic>FABP2</italic> A54T) that had previously been associated with phenotypes directly related to cold tolerance. Since variation in climate may be correlated with other aspects of environmental variation, it is possible that some of the signals that we detected reflect selective pressures other than climate. Nevertheless, our results are consistent with the idea that climate has been an important selective pressure acting on candidate genes for common metabolic disorders.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>The human species inhabits a wide geographical range encompassing a diversity of climates, and adaptation to these climates likely played an important role in shaping genetic and phenotypic variation among populations. We hypothesized that spatially varying selective pressures related to climate shaped the frequencies of genetic variants in the energy metabolic pathway. To test this hypothesis, we examined patterns of genetic variation in 82 candidate genes for common metabolic disorders across the 52 globally dispersed populations of the Human Genome Diversity Project. We applied a combination of statistical approaches to test whether the geographic distribution of these variants could be accounted for by differing climates, consistent with a signal of spatially varying positive selection. For several climate variables, we observed signals in excess of that expected from human population history and chance alone. Significantly, many of these signals were from genes previously shown to affect cold tolerance and disease risk. Our results provide evidence that variation among human populations in susceptibility to common metabolic diseases may be due, in part, to different histories of selective pressures on genes in these disease pathways. Furthermore, our results point to additional genes and variants that are suitable targets for follow-up disease association studies.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Hancock AM, Witonsky DB, Gordon AS, Eshel G, Pritchard JK, et al.

If phenotypes that increase heat or cold tolerance were acted upon by natural selection, the genes responsible for these phenotypes would be expected to carry detectable signatures of selection in the spatial distribution of genetic variation. Indeed, latitudinal clines of allele frequencies have been observed for several polymorphisms in humans (e.g. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040032-b002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040032-b003">3</xref>&#x0005d;) as well as in natural populations of model organisms, including <named-content content-type="genus-species">Drosophila melanogaster</named-content> (e.g. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040032-b004">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040032-b008">8</xref>&#x0005d;), and <named-content content-type="genus-species">Arabidopsis thaliana</named-content> (&#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040032-b009">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040032-b011">11</xref>&#x0005d;). Interestingly, many of the variants with latitudinal clines in <italic>Drosophila</italic> reside in genes involved in energy metabolism.</p><p>Adaptations to spatially varying selective pressures, such as climates, may be particularly important in human populations. Because the human species first arose in equatorial Africa, the ability to tolerate high temperatures was likely under strong long-term selection in ancestral human populations. As humans spread out of equatorial Africa to regions at higher latitudes, cold temperatures likely became important selective forces. As a consequence, traits under stabilizing selection at near-equatorial latitudes may have become deleterious at higher latitudes. In addition to thermal stress, this scenario is likely to apply to a range of selective pressures, e.g. exposure to UV radiation and to different pathogens, which may be directly influenced by and partly correlated with climate. A striking example of adaptation to an environmental variable is variation in skin pigmentation, a phenotype known to vary worldwide as a function of UV radiation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040032-b012">12</xref>&#x0005d;. Consistent with the notion that variation in skin pigmentation is adaptive, genome-wide scans for selection have detected strong signals at candidate genes for melanin production and melanocyte function &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040032-b013">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040032-b018">18</xref>&#x0005d;. Another possible example of spatial variation in selective pressures is sodium homeostasis. It was proposed that climate-related selection acted on the genes influencing salt and water retention and that variation in the intensity of selection partly accounts for the large inter-ethnic differences in the prevalence of salt-sensitive hypertension &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040032-b019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040032-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d;. In support of this hypothesis, two recent studies reported a strong correlation between the frequencies of candidate risk variants for hypertension and latitude; this correlation was significant also when compared to that observed for a genome-wide set of random markers &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040032-b021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040032-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>In addition to skin pigmentation and sodium homeostasis, human body shape and size also show clines with climate variables, suggesting that humans conform to the classical ecological rules that individuals inhabiting colder regions are bulkier and have shorter relative limb lengths &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040032-b023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040032-b024">24</xref>&#x0005d;. More specifically, classical work by Roberts showed that mean annual temperature is significantly correlated with body mass and relative sitting height &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040032-b025">25</xref>&#x0005d;. Forty years later, a re-examination of body mass measures found a strong correlation with mean annual temperature, but the slope of the correlation was smaller, probably due to nutritional changes in a subset of populations &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040032-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d;. These results imply that climate had a strong influence on human morphology. Importantly, this influence can be detected even though, due to climate changes and population movements, the current climate conditions are only weak proxies for the long-term climate experienced by each population. In addition to clines of body mass measures, it was shown that basal metabolic rate is consistently elevated in indigenous circumpolar populations of North America and Siberia &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040032-b027">27</xref>&#x0005d;. Although not all of this phenotypic variation has a genetic basis, these findings suggest that the metabolic state of individuals differs across populations and that this variation has adaptive significance.</p><p>The biological processes that influence tolerance to climatic extremes are likely to play important roles in the pathogenesis of common metabolic disorders, such as type 2 diabetes (T2D), obesity, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. For example, obesity risk is likely to be related to variation in energy balance, through variation in food intake, body mass index, and basal metabolic rate. Additional examples include the relationships between T2D risk and variation in blood glucose levels, between lipid levels and intake, processing and storage of lipids, and between hypertension risk and sodium retention and arterial vessel tone. Therefore, susceptibility genes for these common metabolic disorders are promising candidate targets of climate adaptations. Interestingly, these phenotypes tend to co-occur in individuals, an observation that gave rise to the definition of the metabolic syndrome as a clustering of quantitative phenotypes related to T2D, obesity, hypertension and dyslipidemia &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040032-b028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040032-b029">29</xref>&#x0005d;. The clustering in individuals, along with their concomitant increase in prevalence, suggests that these diseases result from a set of shared metabolic defects and that these defects are adaptations to the life style, diet and climates experienced by human populations over long-term evolutionary time &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040032-b020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040032-b030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040032-b031">31</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>With the goal of selecting genes that experienced similar selective pressures, we used a bioinformatics approach that aims to characterize the core gene subnetwork of the metabolic syndrome phenotypes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040032-b032">32</xref>&#x0005d;. The genes in this subnetwork are likely to harbor those shared metabolic defect(s) that result in the clustering of metabolic disorders. To test the hypothesis that these genes adapted to the different climates experienced by human populations, we captured genetic variation in these genes by tag SNPs, which were genotyped in a worldwide panel of individuals &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040032-b033">33</xref>&#x0005d;. Statistical tests were then performed to detect spatial patterns of allele frequencies that reflect the action of climate-related selective pressures. We find that these genes, as a group, harbor an excess of tag SNPs whose allele frequencies are correlated with climate variables. This suggests that climate was an important selective pressure acting on the biological processes underlying common metabolic disorders.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><p>To identify spatial patterns of allele frequencies that result from adaptations to climate, we analyzed newly collected genotype data for 1083 SNPs in a worldwide panel of 1034 individuals from 54 populations, 52 of which belong to the Human Genome Diversity Project (HGDP) panel &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040032-b033">33</xref>&#x0005d;. Of the 1083 SNPs, 873 are tag SNPs in 82 genes belonging to the core network of the metabolic syndrome phenotypes and 210 are control SNPs from unconstrained genomic regions. We characterized the signal of spatially varying selection in terms of the correlation between allele frequencies and four summaries of climate. To assess the significance of the correlation between genic SNP allele frequencies and climate, we compared the patterns observed at genic and control SNPs. In this analysis, the control SNPs are meant to provide an empirical null distribution for the spatial patterns of variation generated by human population history alone. Finally, to explore the performance of our approach in an empirical setting, we genotyped tag SNPs from a gene, <italic>SLC24A5</italic>, which is known to influence variation in skin pigmentation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040032-b013">13</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Selection of Candidate Genes in the Metabolic Syndrome Core Subnetwork</title><p>In order to select a broad set of genes playing a role in metabolic disease phenotypes, we used a network-based algorithm, referred to as Molecular Triangulation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040032-b032">32</xref>&#x0005d;, which uses &#x0201c;seed genes&#x0201d;, i.e. genes previously implicated in disease risk, to search through the total network of gene-gene interactions to define the disease sub-network. The seed genes can be thought of as casting a shadow on the network, the size of which is proportional to the strength of the evidence implicating the seed in the disease phenotype. Therefore, a non-seed gene interacting with a strongly supported seed gene has a high probability of belonging to the disease subnetwork; note that the disease subnetwork will include both seed and non-seed genes, all prioritized based on the network analysis.</p><p>To create the total gene network, we compiled a list of human gene-gene interactions from databases containing data from automated and human-curated literature extraction methods (BIND, preBIND, MIPS, MINT, and GeneWays) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040032-b034">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040032-b038">38</xref>&#x0005d; as well as from two large-scale yeast two-hybrid studies that used human proteins &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040032-b039">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040032-b040">40</xref>&#x0005d;. This total interaction network contains 12,743 genes and 224,269 non-redundant gene-gene interactions.</p><p>To choose the seed genes, we conducted a large-scale literature review to identify genes that had been implicated in the etiology of T2D, obesity, hypertension, and dyslipidemia, separately, or of the metabolic syndrome as a phenotype. Each gene was scored depending on whether it was implicated in a given phenotype based on data from association studies (single and meta-analyses), animal models of the disease, pharmacological and physiological studies, or studies of the Mendelian form of the disease (seed genes for each phenotype are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0040032-st001">Tables S1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0040032-st005">S5</xref>). This information was combined to create a primary evidence score for each seed gene that summarizes the strength of the evidence implicating it in a given disease phenotype. The Molecular Triangulation algorithm uses the primary evidence scores and the total network to calculate a secondary evidence score (a function of the primary evidence scores and distances from all seed genes) for each gene and disease; the significance of the secondary evidence score is assessed by permutations &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040032-b032">32</xref>&#x0005d;. The permutation-based <italic>p</italic>-values were combined across phenotypes for each gene and were used to rank all the genes in the total network (i.e. both seeds and non-seeds), separately. The highest ranking 39 seed and 35 non-seed genes (excluding genes that were poorly tagged in the HapMap data) were selected for analysis.</p><p>Because current knowledge of the true human gene-gene interaction network is incomplete, not all seed genes are found in the total network (e.g. <italic>TCF7L2</italic>) and not all strong candidate genes are identified as high ranking genes by the network analysis (e.g. <italic>PPARG</italic>). Therefore, we also selected an additional 8 genes with strong evidence of involvement in metabolic syndrome phenotypes.

In total, we included 82 genes in the analysis (listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0040032-st006">Table S6</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Testing for Spatially Varying Selection</title><p>We used the HapMap Phase II data &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040032-b054">54</xref>&#x0005d; to select 873 tagging SNPs that capture most of the variation in the 82 candidate genes (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). In addition, we selected 210 control SNPs. The control SNPs were chosen from non-coding regions that do not contain and are not tightly linked to evolutionarily constrained sequence elements. In order not to introduce a bias, the same ascertainment scheme was used to select genic and control SNPs (except that only one tag SNP was chosen at random from each control region) (for details, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). A total of 1,083 SNPs typed in 964 individuals from the HGDP panel as well as in 37 Ewondo Beti and 33 Hausa from Cameroon yielded genotype data that passed our data quality filter (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>).</p><p>To check that the control SNPs were appropriately matched to the genic SNPs, we calculated the minor allele frequency and F<sub>ST</sub> for each SNP in our data and compared the frequency distributions of these two statistics between the two sets of SNPs. A global F<sub>ST</sub> value, based on the average squared deviation between regional allele frequencies and the global average (&#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040032-b055">55</xref>&#x0005d; p. 167), was calculated among the seven major geographical regions defined by Rosenberg et al. 2002 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040032-b056">56</xref>&#x0005d;. Using a two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, we found no significant difference between the distributions of genic and control SNPs for minor allele frequency (D &#x0003d; 0.058, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.61) or F<sub>ST</sub> (D &#x0003d; 0.070, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.38). This suggests that our procedure for matching genic and control SNPs is reliable and that the control SNPs can provide an appropriate empirical null distribution for spatial patterns of variation expected for putatively neutral regions.</p><p>To test the hypothesis that climate-related selection shaped variation in the candidate genes, we obtained climate data for each population in our panel. We selected six climate variables likely to reflect the physiological effects of cold and hot climates (i.e. precipitation rate, relative humidity, minimum temperature, maximum temperature, mean temperature and short wave radiation flux). Separate values for summer and winter seasons were obtained for each of these variables. Since many of these variables are strongly correlated with one another, we reduced the dimensionality of the climate data using principal components analysis. In all analyses, we used the first two principal components (PCs) for each season, which together explained 77.6&#x00025; and 78.6&#x00025; of the variance in the complete data set for summer and winter variables, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0040032-st007">Tables S7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0040032-st008">S8</xref>). It should be noted that because of climate changes and population movements over evolutionary time, the current values of these climate variables may be only partially correlated with the long-term climatic conditions experienced by each population.</p><p>To assess the relationship between SNP allele frequency and climate, we used two methods that make different assumptions and, therefore, may be complementary. The first one, Spearman rank correlation, is a non-parametric method that does not assume a linear relationship between the variables. The second one, which will be denoted Bayesian geographic analysis, is a newly developed method that tests whether a linear relationship between allele frequency and a climate variable provides a significantly better fit than the null model alone, where the population covariance matrix provides the basis for the null model (Coop et al., in preparation). With both methods, statistical significance was assessed against the distribution of the test statistic calculated from the set of control SNPs. Although the use of control SNPs may be conservative &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040032-b057">57</xref>&#x0005d;, here it is necessary to reduce the number of spurious signals that would arise from the genome-wide correlation between allele frequencies and climate variables. Indeed, the control SNPs show an excess of significant correlations with all climate variables, as assessed against the theoretical null distribution (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0040032-sg001">Figure S1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Signals of Spatially Varying Selection on Metabolism Genes</title><p>We found that many genic SNPs had significant spatial patterns with climate variables (absolute latitude, summer PC1, summer PC2, winter PC1, winter PC2). To assess the evidence for climate adaptations in metabolism genes, we asked if genic SNPs <italic>as a group</italic> show an excess of signals for spatially varying selection. Our expectation was that, even if climate had exerted a strong selective pressure on these genes, only a fraction of genic SNPs would show evidence for spatially varying selection. Therefore, we asked if there was an excess of SNPs in the tail of the distribution of empirical <italic>p</italic>-values for the genic SNPs for several type I error (&#x003b1;) levels. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0040032-t001">Table 1</xref>, we found an excess of genic SNPs with <italic>p</italic>-values above the type I error rate for most climate variables. To rule out the possibility that this pattern was driven by linkage disequilibrium in a few genes with strong signals, we bootstrap resampled across genes and control SNPs and determined how often we found an excess (for details, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). The <italic>RAPTOR</italic> gene had been included in our survey because of a known correlation between latitude and a microsatellite within this gene (Witonsky and Di Rienzo, unpublished data); therefore, <italic>RAPTOR</italic> was omitted from this analysis. (When <italic>RAPTOR</italic> was included in this analysis, we obtained similar results; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0040032-st009">Table S9</xref>.) This analysis revealed strong signals for summer PC1 and winter PC1, consistent with the idea that these summaries of climate variables reflect important selective pressures that shaped the spatial distribution of allele frequencies of metabolism genes in humans.

Since climate and, as a result, UV exposure at the earth surface changed over evolutionary time while latitude did not, it is possible that latitude provides a better proxy for the long-term selective pressures that shaped variation in these genes. It is also possible that the power to detect a correlation varies for different climate variables. For example, if the spatial distribution of some climate variables is similar to genome-wide patterns of population structure, neutral allele frequencies may be more strongly correlated with these climate variables, possibly leading to a greater reduction in power for some variables compared to others. Indeed, we found that the correlation between control SNP allele frequencies and climate PCs differs across variables (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0040032-sg001">Figure S1</xref>).

To select a group of genes likely to have experienced similar selective pressures, we exploited the knowledge-base gleaned from studies of the metabolic syndrome and its phenotypes coupled with a bioinformatics approach based on network theory. Common variation in these genes was systematically captured by genotyping tag SNPs in a worldwide population panel and the data were analyzed to characterize the spatial patterns of variation. Based on the assumption that selection varies according to measurable aspects of climate, we show that the spatial distribution of allele frequencies in genes involved in metabolic processes is significantly different from that of unconstrained SNPs. Although we cannot exclude the possibility that other environmental variables correlated with climate drove part of the signals of spatially varying selection, our results argue for a role of climate adaptations in the biological processes underlying the metabolic syndrome and its phenotypes.</p><p>The finding that variation in candidate genes for common metabolic disorders was selected because it increased tolerance to climatic extremes is supported by the link between a number of non-disease metabolic traits and the phenotypes of the metabolic syndrome.

Therefore, because of the partial overlap between common metabolic disorders and cold-adaptive phenotypes, the subset of SNPs with strong signals of spatially varying selection detected in this study can be considered strong candidates for the genetic susceptibility to the metabolic syndrome.</p><p>Consistent with the idea of a link between the genetic susceptibility to metabolic disorders and adaptations to climate, many of the SNPs with strong signals in our analysis were also associated with metabolic phenotypes. As a general observation, this may not be surprising: genes were included in the analysis because of prior evidence of association with metabolic disorders. However, the specific patterns observed at SNPs in which signals of spatially varying selection coincided with evidence of association with specific phenotypes were not dictated by our study design.

However, two of these derived alleles (<italic>LEPR</italic> 109R and <italic>PON1</italic> 192Q) decrease risk to disease phenotypes (obesity and CAD), while the other two (<italic>FABP2</italic> 54T and <italic>EPHX2</italic> 287Q) increase risk for disease traits (obesity and coronary artery calcification). Moreover, the frequencies of two additional derived alleles that protect against T2D (i.e. rs7903146 in <italic>TCF7L2</italic> and P12A (rs1805192) in <italic>PPARG</italic>) and show significant climate signals also increase outside Africa. Therefore, these derived alleles have opposing effects on disease susceptibility, even though they are all likely to be involved in adaptations to cold climates. This observation contrasts with the results of a survey of variants influencing risk to hypertension; in all cases, the frequencies of the protective alleles were found to increase outside Africa, but some of these alleles were ancestral rather than derived &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040032-b022">22</xref>&#x0005d;. A possible explanation is that the impact of climate adaptations on the susceptibility to common diseases varies depending on the biological process underlying the specific disease trait. For example, it is reasonable to expect that adaptations to heat and cold stress involve a different set of genes and biological processes, e.g. sodium homeostasis and energy metabolism, respectively. Therefore, the evidence for climate adaptations in candidate genes for metabolic disorders does not lead to the expectation that these conditions will systematically occur at higher frequency in one ethnic group compared to another. On the other hand, one might speculate that climate adaptations involving different biological processes account in part for the distribution of metabolic profiles and disease-related traits across ethnic groups &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040032-b088">88</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>The idea that alleles that confer adaptations to climate have opposing effects on disease susceptibility is not entirely unexpected; this is probably because positive selection acted on phenotypes that are related, but distinct from the metabolic disorders that reach high prevalence among contemporary populations or that account only for a portion of all patients. For example, a haplotype in the <italic>TCF7L2</italic> gene was reported to carry a signature of positive selection and this haplotype includes the derived allele at SNP rs7903146 that protects against T2D &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040032-b066">66</xref>&#x0005d;. Interestingly, this haplotype is associated with higher body mass index and altered concentrations of the hunger-satiety hormones ghrelin and leptin, suggesting that it conferred a selective advantage on energy metabolism. Our finding that SNP rs7903146 has a significant signal of spatially varying selection and that the derived allele increases in frequency outside Africa is consistent with this proposal. Furthermore, it illustrates how an adaptation to climate may partially, but not entirely overlap with the disease phenotype.</p><p>A key feature of our approach was the use of a network algorithm to choose a set of candidate genes likely to have experienced similar selective pressures, hence leading to the expectation that these genes, <italic>as a group</italic>, would show a signal of spatially varying selection. A network approach seemed particularly appropriate because of the widely accepted idea that the clustering of quantitative phenotypes typical of the metabolic syndrome is due to a small set of shared metabolic defects. By choosing seed genes implicated in all or most of the phenotypes that characterize the metabolic syndrome, we aimed to extract information regarding the core portion of the metabolic syndrome subnetwork; the genes in this core subnetwork are likely to be responsible for the concomitant increase in prevalence of metabolic syndrome phenotypes and to have been targets of natural selection in ancestral populations. The observed excess of signals of spatially varying selection in this group of genes suggests that our strategy for identifying candidate genes with similar evolutionary histories was successful. Interestingly, we found a similar proportion of seed and non-seed genes with signals of spatially varying selection, consistent with the idea that network theory provides a useful framework for elucidating the impact of natural selection.</p><p>From the population genetics standpoint, our results suggest that searching for a correlation between allele frequencies and specified environmental variables complements other approaches to detecting the signature of selection that also compare allele frequencies across populations. For example, there is a long history of using F<sub>ST</sub> values for detecting adaptations to local environments &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040032-b089">89</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040032-b091">91</xref>&#x0005d; and this approach has been recently applied to genome-wide variation data &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040032-b092">92</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040032-b093">93</xref>&#x0005d;. Even though spatially varying selection may lead to high F<sub>ST</sub> values, a strong and significant correlation between allele frequencies and environmental variables can be detected even if allele frequencies at opposite extremes of the environmental range are not highly differentiated. This is what we observed, for example, in the <italic>RAPTOR</italic> gene, which carries the strongest signal with latitude. Six SNPs are significant with empirical <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05; however, when compared to the HapMap data, the F<sub>ST</sub> values for these same SNPs are unremarkable, with 12&#x00025; to 86&#x00025; of HapMap SNPs showing more extreme values.</p><p>The power and accuracy of our approach is likely to depend on a number of factors, including the strength of selection relative to gene flow. If selection is not sufficiently strong to spread favored alleles between subdivided populations, allele frequencies may not show the expected clines with the appropriate environmental variable. This may be the case for some of the signals observed in this study. For example, the allele frequencies at candidate SNPs for skin pigmentation are not most strongly correlated with the variable, i.e. short-wave radiation, that most closely matches the selective pressure acting on these variants. Indeed, several of these variants reach high frequency only in Eurasian populations living west of the Himalayas, while East Asian populations at similar latitudes have allele frequencies as low as those found in Sub-Saharan Africa &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040032-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;. Although further work is necessary to estimate the power of our approach for a range of selective coefficients and migration rates, our empirical investigation based on the skin pigmentation SNPs suggests that strong signals can be detected even if the spatial distribution of allele frequencies does not match exactly the spatial distribution of the intensity of selection. Additional factors that may affect the power and accuracy of our approach include threshold effects on fitness, so that a correlation between an allele frequency and an environmental variable is expected only over a portion of the range of environmental variation. Furthermore, as noted for skin pigmentation variants &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040032-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;, parallel mutations that arose in different populations may obscure the expected correlation with the relevant environmental variable.</p><p>Although we tested for a correlation between allele frequencies and climate variables, it is unclear whether all the signals of spatially varying selection reported here are the result of adaptations to climate rather than other environmental variables. To the extent that other features of the environment are partially correlated with climate, our method is unlikely to distinguish between selective pressures. For example, UV radiation, which was included among the climate variables in our analysis, is correlated with the other climate variables and with latitude (data not shown). Clearly, UV radiation influences environmental temperature and, therefore, it is expected to exert a selective pressure on genes involved in diverse biological processes, from energy metabolism to melanin production. In some cases, climate may be an important determinant of other aspects of the environment. An important example is the diversity of parasitic and infectious disease species, which is known to decrease with latitude mainly as a result of climatic factors &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040032-b094">94</xref>&#x0005d;. Likewise, resource availability, which in turn may influence subsistence and diet, is likely to be partially correlated with climate (see, for example &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040032-b095">95</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040032-b096">96</xref>&#x0005d;). Therefore, the signals of spatially varying selection, detected in this study are likely to be the result of both the direct and indirect influence of climate on human genetic variation; they may also be due to selective pressures entirely unrelated to climate, but partially correlated with it. Despite these caveats, our results indicate that searching for spatial patterns of allele frequencies that correlate with environmental variables will add to our knowledge concerning the history of selective pressures acting on the human genome.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Population samples.</title><p>We genotyped 971 individuals from 52 worldwide populations from the CEPH Human Genome Diversity Project (HGDP) panel &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040032-b033">33</xref>&#x0005d; and 10 duplicate controls.

For each type of evidence, points were added to the primary evidence score in the following manner: ten points were added if there was significant evidence of association from a meta-analysis, one point was added if there was significant evidence of association in a single analysis, four points were added if a Mendelian phenotype results from mutations in a given gene, four points were added if the gene product is a drug target, one point was added if the gene was found to affect a given phenotype in an animal model, one point was added if there was physiological evidence a gene was involved in a phenotype and for genes with at least one of the previous types of evidence, we gave one point for genes that fell under a linkage peak. In order to be included as a &#x0201c;seed&#x0201d; gene in the network analysis, a gene needed to have a primary evidence score &#x02265;3, except in the case of metabolic syndrome, where we only required a score &#x02265;1. The score required was lower for metabolic syndrome because this phenotype is likely to represent a defect in the core metabolic pathway and because few studies have examined metabolic syndrome directly. We chose genes using the molecular triangulation method in two ways: (1) by running the algorithm on each phenotype separately and then combining the <italic>p</italic>-values and (2) by running the algorithm on genes with strength of evidence scores reflecting evidence for all phenotypes together. For the separate phenotype analysis, we first ran the molecular triangulation algorithm on each phenotype separately and summed the <italic>p</italic>-values associated with the secondary evidence scores across all phenotypes. Then, we chose 50 &#x0201c;seed&#x0201d; and 50 &#x0201c;non-seed&#x0201d; genes with the lowest sums of the <italic>p</italic>-values. For the combined phenotype analysis, we summed the strength of evidence scores for all phenotypes, ran the molecular triangulation algorithm, and chose the most significant 20 &#x0201c;seed&#x0201d; and 20 &#x0201c;non-seed&#x0201d; genes. This list of genes was reduced by choosing the 39 seed and 35 non-seed genes that had the best coverage of tag SNPs in the HapMap (a total of 34 out 140 genes were omitted due to poor tagging in the HapMap). We also selected an additional 8 genes with strong evidence of involvement in MetS phenotypes that were not present in the network. These genes are described in greater detail in the Results section. In total, we included 82 genes in the analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Selection of SNPs in candidate genes.</title><p>Genic SNPs were selected from among HapMap Phase II (Build 35) SNPs located in a region that spans from 100 kb upstream to 100 kb downstream of each of the 82 genes. The frequency of the global minor allele (GMA) for each SNP was estimated based on the allele counts of the combined sample of 180 unrelated HapMap individuals (60 CEU parents, 60 YRI parents, 30 JPT &#x0002b; 30 CHB chosen at random from the 90 Asian samples). Given these allele frequencies, the SNPs selected for genotyping were further filtered using the following steps. First, SNPs with GMA frequency less than 10&#x00025; or greater than 90&#x00025; in all three regional populations were omitted. Second, SNPs from step 1 were sorted into tag bins using ldSelect (v 1.0) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040032-b098">98</xref>&#x0005d;, applying an r<sup>2</sup> threshold of 0.8. The process of sorting into tag bins was done both for the global sample and the non-African (CEU &#x0002b; ASN) sample. Third, tag SNPs were selected from each bin observed in the global sample; in addition, tag SNPs were selected from bins that were found only in the non-African sample. If a tag bin had multiple tag SNPs, the SNP with the highest Illumina assay score was chosen. SNPs were also preferentially included if they were nonsynonymous or if they had been previously associated with disease phenotypes. For all genes, tag SNPs were chosen from among those bins whose span (the smallest region containing all SNPs in the bin) intersected the region between 5 kb upstream and 5 kb downstream of the gene.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Selection of control SNPs.</title><p>To control for the effect of population structure in assessing the relationship between climate variables and allele frequencies at candidate genes, we genotyped a set of control SNPs from unconstrained genomic regions. These regions were chosen from among noncoding regions that are neither conserved nor in strong LD with deeply conserved sequence elements. To select unconserved regions, sequence conservation was calculated over sliding windows (100 bp window size, 1 bp step size) in the human-chicken, human-zebrafish, human-mouse and human-rat genome alignments, which were obtained from the UCSC Genome Browser (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.ucsc.edu">http://genome.ucsc.edu</ext-link>), and a region was considered conserved if sequence identity exceeded 70&#x00025;.

Among these regions, we selected a subset so that their lengths matched the distribution of lengths for genic regions. SNPs from these regions were chosen using a procedure similar to the procedure used in the selection of genic SNPs. Briefly, tag SNPs were chosen so that their allele frequency distribution matched that of SNPs in genic regions. One SNP was selected at random from the set of tag SNPs each control region.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>SNP genotyping.</title><p>1130 SNPs were genotyped using the Illumina BeadArray technology at the UCLA Southern California Genotyping Consortium Facility.

In the first method, a Spearman rank correlation coefficient is calculated for each SNP and each climate variable or PC. The data from the control SNPs are used to provide an empirical null distribution of rank correlation coefficients that reflects the history of human migrations and population structure. Specifically, for the rank correlation coefficient value of each genic SNP we found the percentile value in the control SNP distribution; this percentile value is referred to as the empirical p value for a given genic SNP and a given climate variable or PC. The Spearman rank correlation method does not assume that the relationship between SNP allele frequency and climate variable or PC is linear.</p><p>The second method, which we refer to as Bayesian geographic analysis, is designed to test for a correlation between an environmental variable and the frequency of an allele across populations, while accounting for differences in sample size and the neutral covariation of allele frequencies among populations. This approach involves two stages. First, we use a set of SNPs (which can be treated as randomly chosen for our purposes and which were typed by Conrad et al., 2006 &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0040032-b102">102</xref>&#x0005d;) to estimate the covariance matrix (&#x003a9;) whose entries give the covariance of allele frequencies between pairs of populations. To estimate this matrix we make a number of assumptions. The allele counts at a SNP in a population are assumed to be a binomial draw from the unknown underlying population allele frequency. We assume the population allele frequency within a population marginally has a normal distribution where the mass of the normal distribution below zero is placed as a point mass on zero and the mass above one is placed on one. The population frequency across populations is assumed to have a multivariate normal distribution, with an unknown covariance matrix &#x003a9; and mean &#x003bc;. Given these assumptions we used Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to sample the posterior distribution of the covariance matrix (using standard priors). Second, for each genic SNP and each climate variable, we tested for correlation with the climate variable (whose values across the 52 populations is a vector Y), while controlling for population structure using the covariance matrix estimated in the first step. To perform this test we included a linear effect &#x003b2;Y (where &#x003b2; is the coefficient) in the mean of the multivariate normal, and estimated the posterior of &#x003b2; using MCMC. To summarize the posterior in a single test score we recorded the proportion of the posterior density, which was above zero. If the data has no strong signal of an effect of the environmental variable (Y) the posterior of &#x003b2; will be reasonably symmetrically distributed around zero resulting in scores close to 0.5, a posterior strongly skewed towards positive &#x003b2; will have a score close to one, while a posterior distribution strong skewed towards negative &#x003b2; will give a score close to zero. We also ran a test for each environmental variable on each control SNP and use these scores to estimate, for each environmental variable, an empirical two-tailed <italic>p</italic>-value for each genic SNP.</p><p>We included the two Cameroonian populations (Hausa and Beti) when we ran the Spearman method, but we excluded these populations when we ran the Bayesian geographic analysis method since the covariance matrix was created from a dataset that did not include these populations.</p></sec><sec id="s4h"><title>Testing for excess significance for climate variables.</title><p>Since we performed many tests and the SNPs within a given gene are not independent, we asked whether the genic SNPs as a group show a larger proportion of low p values than expected by chance. To this end, we chose several type I error levels (&#x003b1; &#x0003d; 0.01, 0.05, 0.1 and 0.5) and, for each variable, we calculated the proportion of genic SNPs with empirical <italic>p</italic>-values less than &#x003b1;. Furthermore, because the SNPs within any given genic region are not completely independent while the control SNPs are, it is possible that the observed excess of genic SNPs with <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; &#x003b1; is driven by a large number of correlated SNPs within one or few genes rather than by SNPs in many genes. To distinguish between these two possibilities, we bootstrap re-sampled across genic and control SNPs and recalculated, for each of 1000 bootstrap replicates, the proportion of SNPs with <italic>p</italic>-values lower than each cutoff. This distribution of proportions was then used to get a measure of the confidence that the excess we observed was robust to the choice of genes and control SNPs. More specifically, for each replicate, we drew a set of 81 genes with replacement from the original set of genes and a set of 210 controls with replacement from the list of control SNPs. Then, we calculated empirical <italic>p</italic>-values for each of the genic SNPs using the distribution of control SNPs. Next, we determined the proportion of genic SNPs that had <italic>p</italic>-values less than or equal to each &#x003b1; cutoff. Finally, we found the proportion of bootstrap replicates where the proportion of SNPs with <italic>p</italic>-values less than or equal to the cutoff was greater than expected by chance.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pgen-0040032-sg001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><title>Correlation between Climate Variables and Control SNPs</title><p>(A) shows the frequency distribution of the Spearman rank correlation test statistic (&#x003c1;) for the control SNPs for each of the climate variables.
