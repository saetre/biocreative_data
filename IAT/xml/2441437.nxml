Human tankyrases post-translationally modify multiple proteins involved in processes including maintenance of telomere length, sister telomere association, and trafficking of glut4-containing vesicles. To date, however, little is known about in vivo functions for tankyrases. We recently reported that body size was significantly reduced in mice deficient for tankyrase 2, but that these mice otherwise appeared developmentally normal. In the present study, we report generation of tankyrase 1-deficient and tankyrase 1 and 2 double-deficient mice, and use of these mutant strains to systematically assess candidate functions of tankyrase 1 and tankyrase 2 <italic>in vivo</italic>. No defects were observed in development, telomere length maintenance, or cell cycle regulation in tankyrase 1 or tankyrase 2 knockout mice. In contrast to viability and normal development of mice singly deficient in either tankyrase, deficiency in both tankyrase 1 and tankyrase 2 results in embryonic lethality by day 10, indicating that there is substantial redundancy between tankyrase 1 and tankyrase 2, but that tankyrase function is essential for embryonic development.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The tankyrase protein family consists of tankyrase 1 and 2, which share 85&#x00025; amino acid sequence identity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002639-Kuimov1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002639-Smith1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

The role of human tankyrase has been extensively assessed in maintenance of telomeres. Telomeres are structures at the end of eukaryotic chromosomes, consisting of hexanucleotide repeats and associated proteins, which play a critical role in cellular senescence, apoptosis and tumorigenesis, reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002639-Blackburn1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002639-Garcia1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>. Telomere length is regulated by the enzyme telomerase, which consists of a catalytic telomerase <underline>r</underline>everse <underline>t</underline>ranscriptase (TERT) and an <underline>R</underline>NA <underline>t</underline>emplate (TR) that encodes the telomeric DNA sequence, reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002639-Autexier1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Tankyrase 1 has been shown to co-localize with TRF1 to telomeres <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002639-Smith1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Overexpression of human tankyrase 1 results in release of TRF1 from telomeres and telomere elongation in human cell lines, whereas overexpression of mutated tankyrase 1 lacking PARP activity fails to affect TRF1 and telomere length <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002639-Cook1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002639-Smith2">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. These studies have lead to the hypothesis that tankyrase 1 ADP-ribosylates TRF1, releasing it from telomeric complexes, resulting in a telomeric conformation that provides greater access of telomerase to telomeres.</p><p>SiRNA-mediated knockdown of human tankyrase 1 has been shown to result in cell cycle arrest at mitosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002639-Chang2">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002639-Dynek1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, with an increase in persistent sister telomere association <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002639-Dynek1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref> and spindle dysfunction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002639-Chang2">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>.

Recently, it was shown that the requirement for tankyrase 1 in sister telomere resolution and mitotic progression could be abrogated by depletion of TRF1 and its binding partner TIN2 or the cohesin subunit SA1, suggesting that unresolved cohesion at telomeres might promote persistent sister telomere association and mitotic arrest <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002639-Canudas1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>In addition to telomere-related functions, it has been reported that knockdown of human tankyrase 1 in adipocyctes inhibits translocation of the glucose transporter Glut4 and insulin-regulated aminopeptidase (IRAP) from endosomal compartments to the plasma membrane, altering intracellular Glut4/IRAP distribution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002639-Yeh1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Glut4 and IRAP are among the cargo of Glut4 storing vesicles (GSV), and it was suggested that GSV trafficking depends upon the presence of IRAP in these vesicles, which in turn is regulated by tankyrase via its PARP activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002639-Yeh1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002639-Chi1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. It has therefore been proposed that tankyrases may regulate insulin-dependent glucose metabolism through their effect on GSV.</p><p>Although tankyrase 2 has been less extensively studied than tankyrase 1, the structural homology and protein binding properties of tankyrase 1 and 2 suggest that tankyrase 2 might have similar or redundant functions with tankyrase 1. The function of human tankyrase 2 in telomere length maintenance has been shown to be similar to that of tankyrase 1. Overexpression of wild type tankyrase 2 in human cells resulted in telomere elongation, while overexpression of tankyrase 2 mutated in the PARP domain failed to induce elongation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002639-Hsiao1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Whether human tankyrase 2 mediates functions similar to those described for tankyrase 1 in separation of sister telomeres and mitotic progression remains to be determined. It is similarly unclear whether tankyrase 2 functions in GSV transport and glucose uptake in a manner similar to tankyrase 1. It was reported that tankyrase 2 can interact with IRAP in a yeast two hybrid system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002639-Sbodio2">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>; however, the involvement of tankyrase 2 in regulation of GSV trafficking has not been defined.</p><p>Recently, we reported <italic>in vivo</italic> studies of tankyrase 2 function using mice genetically engineered to be completely deficient in TANK2 or to express a PARP-deficient TANK2 mutation. TANK2 deficient mice developed normally and exhibited no detectable change in telomere length, but did show a significant decreases in total body weight that might reflect a role of tankyrase 2 in glucose/fat metabolism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002639-Hsiao1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002639-Chiang1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. The absence of other changes, including those in telomere length, could reflect a redundancy of tankyrase 1 and tankyrase 2 functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002639-Hsiao1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002639-Chiang1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, to further understand the <italic>in vivo</italic> functions of tankyrases, we have generated TANK1 knockout mice and TANK1/2 double deficient mice. In the present study, we report a systematic analysis of putative tankyrase functions in mice deficient in either tankyrase 1 or tankyrase 2, as well as the phenotype resulting from deficiency in both tankyrase 1 and tankyrase 2.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Targeting vector, electroporation, and selection</title><p>A tankyrase 1 gene targeting vector was constructed from an 11 kb SalI/KpnI fragment of mouse genomic DNA containing the first exon of tankyrase 1.

Analysis of the Genebank database sequence indicates that TANK1 has a potential alternative promoter capable of producing an alternative transcript which corresponds to a previously reported EST sequence (Accession #AK046840) and which could be translated into a HPS (region containing homopolymeric runs of His, Pro, and Ser) domain-deleted tankyrase 1 protein, which we designate as TANK1a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002639-g003">Fig. 3</xref>).

This could correspond to the protein of TANK1a, because the tankyrase 1 knockout was generated in the present study by removal of the (first) promoter region and exon 1 of the TANK gene. The alternative promoter of the gene remains intact in the TANK1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mouse and is potentially functional. The lower molecular weight TANK1a band was detected in both WT and TANK1&#x02212;/&#x02212; testis by immunoblotting with antibody 763 (made against full length tank1, data not shown), antibody 762 (anti-SAM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002639-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>) and antibody 465 (anti-SAM, data not shown), but not with antibody 376 (anti-HPS, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002639-g002">Fig. 2E</xref>). To understand the transcriptional expression of tankyrase 1a, the TANK1a expression-specific primers (TNK1AF151 and TNK1AR576 set) were used for RT-PCR analysis. The TANK1a-specific RT-PCR showed that WT and TANK1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> testis expressed similar levels of TANK1a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002639-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>).

RT-PCR product of TANK1a was detected only in WT testis, and not in kidney, spleen, or thymus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002639-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>). The RNA expression pattern of TANK1a thus correlated with expression of the protein tankyrase 1a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002639-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>).

It has also been suggested that tankyrases regulate translocation of Glut4, thus playing a critical role in glucose metabolism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002639-Yeh1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002639-Chi1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. We have carried out a systematic analysis of tankyrase function in vivo by analyzing the effects of inactivating either or both tankyrase genes in mice.</p><p>The most extensively studied aspect of tankyrase function has involved the role of tankyrases in regulation of telomere length. In contrast to what has been observed in <italic>in vitro</italic> studies of human tankyrase function, we recently reported that neither complete deficiency of mouse tankyrase 2 nor mutation in its PARP domain affects the maintenance of telomere length <italic>in vivo</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002639-Hsiao1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002639-Chiang1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. To further assess the function of mouse tankyrases, we generated tankyrase 1 knockout and tankyrase 1/2 double knockout mice. In the present study we found no defects in telomere length maintenance in tankyrase 1 deficient mice. These findings could reflect the absence of any role for tankyrase in telomere length regulation in mice, in contrast to the function of telomerase, which is functionally conserved in humans and mice. The function of human tankyrases in modulating telomere length has been linked to their ability to bind to TRF1. Mouse TRF1 lacks a tankyrase binding motif, consistent with the possibility that tankyrase function in telomere maintenance differs with species (11, 16, 20, 21), and that tankyrases do not play a role in telomere length regulation in mice. The lack of effect on telomere length in either TANK1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> or TANK2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> single knockout mice could also reflect functional redundancy rather than lack of function of these two molecules. The fact that TANK1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>.TANK2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> double deficiency results in embryonic lethality in fact indicates that there is redundancy of these genes for one or more functions critical for viability, as discussed below, but complicates analysis of potentially redundant functions in telomere maintenance. Studies of conditional knockout mice and/or siRNA treatment of either TANK1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> or TANK2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> cells could provide information on the nature of redundant function.</p><p>It has been shown that tankyrase 1 is necessary for successful resolution of sister telomere association at mitosis in human cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002639-Dynek1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002639-Canudas1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, and that knockdown of tankyrase 1 results in mitotic arrest <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002639-Chang2">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002639-Dynek1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. In contrast, in the studies reported here, we have demonstrated that inactivation of tankyrase 1 or tankyrase 2 has no effect on mitosis in the mouse cells analyzed. It was recently reported that depletion of TRF1 and TIN2 abrogates the requirement for tankyrase 1 in human sister telomere resolution and mitotic progression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002639-Canudas1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, it is possible that our failure to observe an effect on mitosis in tankyrase-deficient mouse cells reflects the absence of interaction between mouse TRF1 and tankyrases. As noted above, an alternative explanation is the existence of redundant functions of tankyrase 1 and tankyrase 2 in sister telomere resolution and mitotic progression. Of note is the finding that embryonic lethality of TANK1/TANK2 double knockout mice does not occur until embryonic day 10. It would be anticipated that any profound defect in mitosis in these mice would be lethal at a very early stage and would prevent development to this point unless alternative tankyrase-independent mechanisms are active during early embryogenesis. There may therefore be a profound species difference in the requirement for tankyrase during mitosis.</p><p>We previously reported that tankyrase 2 deficiency results in a reproducible decrease in overall body weight <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002639-Hsiao1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0002639-Chiang1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. In contrast, there was no decrease in body weight in TANK1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. Although the basis for alteration in body weight is not clear, it may be related to changes in overall metabolism, potentially including tankyrase-dependent regulation of GSV. Deficiency of mouse tankyrase 1 did not affect body weight in TANK1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mouse in contrast to the effect seen in TANK2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice. Insulin-stimulated glucose uptake tended to be reduced in TANK2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> WAT cells, but this difference was not statistically significant, while TANK1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> WAT cells have normal sensitivity of insulin-stimulated glucose uptake. A comprehensive analysis of <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> glucose metabolism in tankyrase 2-deficient mice is currently in progress (manuscript in preparation).</p><p>The studies presented here also revealed the existence of a previously unappreciated TANK1 gene product, designated TANK1a, encoding an HPS domain-deleted TANK1 protein that was observed in mouse testis. The mRNA encoding TANK1a was transcribed by an alternative promoter of the TANK1 gene. The expression of TANK1a was tissue-specific, with mRNA and protein detected in testis, but not other tissues tested, in contrast to the apparently ubiquitous expression of tankyrase 1 and tankyrase 2 mRNA. The function of TANK1a will require further study.</p><p>Although development of TANK1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and TANK2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> single deficient mice was generally normal, TANK1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>TANK2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and TANK1<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> TANK2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> genotypes were embryonic lethal at E10.5 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0002639-t001">Table 1</xref>), and the TANK1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> TANK2<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> genotype was partially lethal (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0002639-t001">Table 1</xref>)These findings indicate that tankyrase 1 and 2 mediate redundant functions that are critical to embryonic mouse development. Although the underlying mechanism of this lethality is unclear, histological study indicated that TANK1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>TANK2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> and TANK1<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> TANK2<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> embryos lacked umbilical cords and that placental development was abnormal, factors which are sufficient to result in the death of embryos.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are grateful to Drs.
