In wild-type Arabidopsis, root hairs are formed by epidermal cells termed trichoblasts which overlie the boundary between two cortical cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The formation of a root hair can be divided into two distinct stages, namely initiation and outgrowth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The first detectable marker of root hair initiation is the appearance of a Rop GTPase which is localised towards the basal end of trichoblasts prior to any visible bulge formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The first visible sign of root hair initiation is characterized by the formation of a bulge which in Arabidopsis is typically located towards the basal end of the epidermal cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In order for the bulge to form, the cell wall must undergo loosening and it is thought that alkalinisation of the cytoplasm, acidification of the cell wall [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], expansin (EXP) and xyloglucan endotransglycosylase (XET) activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] all contribute to this step. XETs act by breaking and reforming the glycosidic bonds of xyloglucan which cross links cellulose microfibrils whereas the expansins mediate cell wall loosening without undergoing breakage of the major structural components of the cell wall. XET activity has been demonstrated to be localized to the site of root hair bulge formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], suggesting a specific role in hair formation. Two of the Arabidopsis expansin genes (<italic>AtEXP7 </italic>and <italic>AtEXP18</italic>) are expressed in trichoblast but not atrichoblast cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], indicating that they also play a role in loosening of the cell wall to promote hair initiation and outgrowth. The role of expansins in root hair formation is further substantiated by the finding that they accumulate at the site of bulge formation in maize roots [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Additionally, in barley the <italic>HvEXPB1 </italic>expansin gene expression is absent in the root hairless <italic>bald root barley </italic>mutant but is normal in 2 mutants which form short root hairs. This suggests that the HvEXPB1 is required for the initiation of root hairs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>Cellulose is a major structural component of cell walls comprising chains of &#x003b2;-1,4-linked glucosyl residues which are assembled into microfibrils. The arrangement of the microfibrils in the cell wall influences the manner in which cells expand. A number of mutants have been described in Arabidopsis which exhibit abnormal cell expansion and several of these are affected in cellulose biosynthesis. For example, abnormal radial swelling is observed in the <italic>rsw1 </italic>(<italic>CESA1</italic>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]), <italic>rsw2 </italic>(<italic>KORRIGAN</italic>; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]); <italic>rsw3 </italic>(glucosidase II; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]) and <italic>rsw10 </italic>(ribose-5-phosphate isomerase; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]) mutants. The <italic>rsw10 </italic>mutant exhibits ballooning of root trichoblast cells that is thought to arise from the cellulose deficiency in the root. Interestingly, the expression of <italic>RSW10 </italic>is not limited to the trichoblast cell files providing a possible link between root hair formation and abnormal expansion in <italic>rsw10</italic>. The <italic>root epidermal bulger </italic>(<italic>reb1/rhd1</italic>) mutant of Arabidopsis also exhibits abnormal expansion of trichoblast cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. <italic>REB1 </italic>encodes an isoform of UDP-D-glucose 4-epimerase which functions in forming UDP-D-galactose. The <italic>reb1 </italic>mutant lacks galactosylated xyloglucan and arabinosylated (1&#x02192;6)-&#x003b2;-D-galactan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Interestingly, the <italic>reb1 </italic>mutant shows a loss of the JIM14 and LM2 arabinogalactan epitope in trichoblasts while it remains in atrichoblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] implying that trichoblast arabinogalactan proteins (AGPs) are required for normal anisotropic expansion.</p><p>In this study we have made use of the <italic>procuste1 </italic>(<italic>prc1-1</italic>) cellulose deficient mutant of Arabidopsis to probe the influence of cell wall structure in modulating root hair formation. The Arabidopsis <italic>prc1-1 </italic>is mutated in the cellulose synthase <italic>CESA6 </italic>gene resulting in a reduction in the cellulose content of the cell walls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Mutant <italic>prc1-1 </italic>seedlings exhibit bulging of the hair forming trichoblast cells of the root and a reduction in primary root elongation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Our studies show that <italic>prc1-1 </italic>is able to partially bypass the defect in hair formation of the <italic>rhd6-1 </italic>root hairless mutant, demonstrating that the cell wall structure is an important factor during hair morphogenesis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Root epidermal bulging in <italic>prc1-1 </italic>is predominantly associated with trichoblast cells</title><p>Despite previous descriptions of the <italic>prc1-1 </italic>phenotype, detailed analysis of the root defects and in particular, the phenomenon of the bulging epidermal cells has not been performed. Examination of <italic>prc1-1 </italic>roots shows that the bulged cells are predominantly arranged in apical-basal oriented files flanked by files of non bulged cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). This indicates that the bulging phenomenon in <italic>prc1-1 </italic>roots may not be a random event but linked in some way to the positional properties of particular cells. To investigate this further, radial sections were made of resin embedded roots of <italic>prc1-1 </italic>and wild-type seedlings and each bulged or non-bulged cell scored as to whether it was in a trichoblast (hair-cell) or atrichoblast (non-hair cell) position. The bulged cells were predominantly though not exclusively located in the trichoblast cells of the <italic>prc1-1 </italic>roots (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D, E</xref>). No evidence of epidermal cell bulging was found in wild-type root tissues (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A, C</xref>). This shows that the bulging of epidermal cells is associated with their radial position with respect to the underlying cortical cells and that it may be linked with the process of hair initiation and/or outgrowth.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold><italic>prc1-1 </italic>roots exhibit epidermal bulging predominantly in trichoblast cells</bold>.

From a sample size of 500 cells from 50 independent primary roots which did not include unbulged cells lacking a root hair, the majority (65%) were bulged and had formed a hair. Bulged cells which had not formed a hair (17%) and cells which were not bulged but had formed a hair (18%) were evident less frequently but in similar proportions. Although the developmental events leading to hair formation in <italic>prc1-1 </italic>normally result in a bulged cell phenotype it is possible for hairs to be formed by cells which are not bulged.</p></sec><sec><title>Mutant <italic>prc1-1 </italic>roots have reduced epidermal cell length and increased root hair density</title><p>The <italic>prc1-1 </italic>roots are shorter than the wild-type (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>) and have a more hairy appearance. This may be a consequence of <italic>prc1-1 </italic>having a reduced epidermal cell length or alternatively the mutant may form more root hairs compared to wild-type. To test these possibilities wild-type and <italic>prc1-1 </italic>roots were cleared and the trichoblast cell lengths measured in differentiated root hair cells. Mutant <italic>prc1-1 </italic>trichoblast cells were 43% reduced in length compared to the wild-type (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). Thus, the shorter <italic>prc1-1 </italic>root length is primarily due to reduced cell elongation rather than decreased cell division. To further determine the basis for the apparent increased hair density in <italic>prc1-1 </italic>roots, the numbers of hairs per mm were counted in separate files of trichoblast cells. This shows that <italic>prc1-1 </italic>root hair density is almost double that of the wild-type (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). Although the majority of <italic>prc1-1 </italic>trichoblast cells formed a single hair, 4% of epidermal cells were observed having two root hairs (n = 358 cells) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref>). In contrast, wild-type trichoblast cells only ever formed single hairs (n = 236 cells) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2D</xref>). It was also notable that <italic>prc1-1 </italic>had a significant degree of branching of the root hairs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref>). Thus the appearance of a higher density of root hairs in <italic>prc1-1 </italic>is largely due to the decrease in epidermal cell length with a minor contribution from the double hair and hair branching phenotypes.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Primary root growth and hair development is affected in the <italic>prc1-1 </italic>mutant</bold>.

The site of future hair formation towards the basal end of trichoblasts is marked by the Rop GTPase prior to any visible bulge formation and thus represents a very early event in root hair initiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The formation of double hairs by a proportion of <italic>prc1-1 </italic>epidermal cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2E</xref>) indicates that the control of the site of hair initiation is affected. To test this, the position of hair formation relative to the basal ends of the epidermal cells was measured for wild-type and <italic>prc1-1 </italic>mutant seedlings. The distribution of hair positions in <italic>prc1-1 </italic>was determined to be significantly different from the wild-type using either a Fisher Exact test (please see Availability &#x00026; requirements section below) using 2 &#x000d7; 5 tables (p = 0.0) or Mann-Whitney rank sum test (please see Availability &#x00026; requirements section below) (p &#x0003c; 0.05), (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>).

In wild-type Arabidopsis roots the Rop signal is localised towards the basal ends of trichoblast cells consistent with the subsequent position of the root hair (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A, E</xref>). In <italic>prc1-1 </italic>Rop signal is also found in some cells to be localized towards the basal region of the trichoblasts but it was noted that the signal was less discrete than in the wild-type and was often localised to a more extreme basal position (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B, F</xref>). However in a proportion of epidermal cells there was a clear shift of the Rop signal to a more apical location (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C, G</xref>) consistent with the observed shift in hair positioning in a subset of the <italic>prc1-1 </italic>epidermal cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>The expression pattern indicated by <italic>PRC1 </italic>promoter activity cannot account for predominance of bulging in trichoblast cells compared to atrichoblasts</title><p>The preferential epidermal bulging in <italic>prc1-1 </italic>trichoblasts compared to atrichoblasts (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D, E</xref>) suggests there is a link with a trichoblast-specific characteristic or function.

To test this wild-type, <italic>prc1-1</italic>, <italic>rhd6-1 </italic>and <italic>prc1-1/rhd6-1 </italic>seedlings were grown in the presence of 10 &#x003bc;M AgNO<sub>3 </sub>or 2 &#x003bc;M AVG.

To test this, <italic>rhd6-1 </italic>roots were grown on MS agar lacking sucrose but with the addition of 1 % arabinose which causes reduced primary root elongation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. The effect of 1 % arabinose on inhibition of primary root elongation was similar for wild-type and <italic>rhd6-1 </italic>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8I</xref>).

Our analyses revealed that the radial swelling of trichoblast cells in <italic>prc1-1 </italic>roots is linked to the early steps in hair formation and that the swelling is greatly reduced in the root hairless <italic>rhd6-1 </italic>mutant background. The radial swelling of <italic>prc1-1 </italic>trichoblasts is reminiscent of similar phenotypes exhibited by the <italic>rsw10 </italic>(ribose-5-phosphate isomerase) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] and <italic>root epidermal bulger 1 </italic>(<italic>reb1/rhd1</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] mutants. The <italic>rsw10 </italic>mutant, like <italic>prc1-1</italic>, shows bulging or ballooning of trichoblast cells and has reduced cell wall cellulose content [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The <italic>RSW10 </italic>gene is expressed in the distal elongation zone root and within epidermal, cortex and vascular cells of the more mature root tissues. This indicates that the cell wall alteration caused by the <italic>rsw10 </italic>is not limited to the trichoblasts and that bulging of trichoblasts may be linked to root hair initiation and/or outgrowth as shown with <italic>prc1-1 </italic>in this study.</p><p>The expression pattern of <italic>PRC1 </italic>as indicated by the p<italic>PRC1</italic>::GUS reporter includes both trichoblast and atrichoblast cell files as well as the underlying cell layers (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). However, the possibility that the activity of the <italic>PRC1 </italic>promoter region used does not reflect the true expression pattern of the endogenous gene cannot be ruled out. Despite this, there is no evidence of a preferential trichoblast expression of <italic>PRC1</italic>, strongly suggesting that this cannot by itself explain the predominance of epidermal cell bulging in the hair forming cells of <italic>prc1</italic>. The primary cell wall cellulose biosynthesis complex is believed to consist of 3 different CesA subunits; namely CesA1, CesA3 and CesA6-related [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. The possibility that functionality of the cellulose biosynthesis complex differs in the trichoblast verses atrichoblast files due to the expression pattern or activity of one of the other CesA proteins or other important factors cannot be ruled out. However, alteration of the cellulose composition of the cell wall is not the only factor controlling trichoblast expansion properties. Analysis of the <italic>reb1 </italic>mutant has indicated that AGPs are involved in anisotropic cell expansion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Thus a number of different factors contribute to control the site of expansion of trichoblast cells.</p><sec><title>Mislocalisation of Rop in <italic>prc1-1 </italic>is unlikely to account for the bulges formed by trichoblasts</title><p>Root hairs in wild-type Arabidopsis are invariably localised close to the basal ends of trichoblast cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] implying that there are developmental mechanisms to control this positioning. Recent work has shown that auxin provides positional information for hair polarity and that this is mediated at least in part via <italic>AUX1/EIN2/GNOM </italic>acting upstream of the recruitment of Rop GTPases to the hair initiation site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Despite this, relatively little is currently understood about the modifications that take place in the cell wall and where these modifications occur to promote hair bulge formation and its subsequent outgrowth.</p><p>The bulging seen in <italic>prc1-1 </italic>trichoblasts occurs over the whole of the outer face of the cell which contrasts with the normal localised bulging associated with the hair initiation site seen in the wild-type. However it is unlikely that the <italic>prc1-1 </italic>bulges are abnormal hair-like structures since normal appearing hairs are often found to develop from the bulged surface. This is further supported by the fact that some limited bulging is found in atrichoblast cells which do not undergo the steps leading to hair initiation. Although Rop is found to be mislocalised in some <italic>prc1-1 </italic>trichoblasts it still remains in a discrete patch even though this is more diffuse than in wild-type cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3E, F, G</xref>). Rop mislocalisation is therefore unlikely to directly cause the uncontrolled bulging over the whole of the outer face of some <italic>prc1-1 </italic>trichoblasts. Nevertheless, constitutive expression of the activated GTP-bound form of Rop2 and Rop4 results in bulging of epidermal cells reminiscent of the <italic>prc1-1 </italic>phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In this case, this may be as a result of Rop marking the whole of the cell wall for loosening rather than a discrete basally localised patch. Thus, CA-Rop expression in wild-type may lead to ectopic cell wall loosening which mimics the <italic>prc1-1 </italic>phenotype. The reason for mislocalisation of Rop in some but not all <italic>prc1-1 </italic>trichoblasts and the more diffuse distribution (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>) is unclear but suggests that cell wall structure or composition influences the localization of Rop proteins to a certain extent.</p></sec><sec><title>Hair formation in <italic>rhd6-1 </italic>can be partially rescued by <italic>prc1-1</italic></title><p>Although RHD6 is clearly an important factor for normal hair formation it is evident that its requirement can be bypassed by application of auxin or ethylene to the growth medium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The <italic>RHD6 </italic>gene has been cloned and shown to encode a basic-helix-loop-helix transcription factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. RHD6 was found to accumulate in the nuclei of trichoblast cells within the meristem and elongation zone but disappeared before emergence of the root hair. This confirms that RHD6 acts at an early stage of root hair initiation and prior to the formation of the bulge. Interestingly the closely related gene <italic>RHD6-LIKE1 </italic>(<italic>AtRSL1</italic>) also displays a trichoblast specific pattern similar to <italic>RHD6</italic>. By making the <italic>rhd6/rsl1 </italic>double mutant it was found that the effect on hair development was synergistic indicating that the two transcription factors function together in the regulation of hair initiation. Results presented in this paper show that the <italic>prc1-1 </italic>mutation is able to partially restore the formation of root hairs in the <italic>rhd6-1 </italic>mutant (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5D, E, F</xref>). It is possible that this partial rescue of the <italic>rhd6-1 </italic>root hair defect may depend on the presence of a functional RSL1. Although this has not been tested, it is apparent that the presence of RSL1 in an <italic>rhd6-1 </italic>mutant background is insufficient to promote the formation of root hairs unless the growth conditions are altered such as growing on cellophane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] or with addition of auxin or ethylene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. While the mechanism for the <italic>prc1-1 </italic>mediated partial restoration of root hairs in <italic>rhd6-1 </italic>remains unclear, clues are provided by the fact that hair formation in the double mutant is accompanied by expression of <italic>EXP7 </italic>which is normally absent in an <italic>rhd6-1 </italic>background. It has previously been shown that <italic>EXP7 </italic>and <italic>EXP18 </italic>expression in <italic>rhd6-1 </italic>is restored by hormonal and environmental treatments which induce root hair formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. These findings are consistent with the idea that <italic>EXP7 </italic>may act to loosen the cell wall and that this promotes hair formation. This is further supported by the finding that the bulged regions of trichoblasts are enriched with expansin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. While results in this study also support the conclusion that <italic>RHD6 </italic>does not directly control transcription of <italic>EXP7</italic>, the functional role of <italic>EXP7 </italic>still needs clarification, since loss-of-function mutants do not display a phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Restoration of root hairs in <italic>prc1-1/rhd6-1 </italic>occurs via an ethylene-dependent pathway</title><p>Root hair formation is dependent on ethylene production and perception and can be blocked using synthesis inhibitors such as AVG or silver as an inhibitor of the ethylene receptor. Previous studies have shown that <italic>prc1 </italic>seedlings grown on ACC exhibited a triple response and therefore that the mutant was sensitive to ethylene. This also indicates that <italic>prc1-1 </italic>is unlikely to overproduce ethylene since it does not exhibit the triple response in the absence of exogenous ethylene. Additionally, the double mutant between <italic>prc1-1 </italic>and the ethylene insensitive <italic>ein2-1 </italic>did not abolish the growth defects of the <italic>prc1-1 </italic>mutant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. This shows that the <italic>prc1-1 </italic>growth defects are likely to be independent of ethylene. Results in this study show that while AVG and Ag<sup>+ </sup>can effectively block the formation of root hairs, the <italic>prc1-1 </italic>epidermal cells still exhibit a bulging phenotype (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">7E, F</xref>). It has also been found that ethylene is unable to rescue the bulging phenotype in <italic>prc1-1 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Thus the bulging phenotype is at least partially independent of ethylene action. The possibility that the <italic>prc1-1 </italic>mutation results in overproduction of ethylene within root epidermal cells cannot be discounted at present. However it is not possible to measure ethylene production specifically in root epidermal cells to address this question.</p></sec><sec><title>A model for cell wall loosening in root hair initiation</title><p>Our results indicate that in wild-type trichoblasts targeting of Rop GTPases to a discrete basal location marks that region for localised cell wall loosening. This poses the question of how cell wall loosening is restricted to the Rop site. One mechanism may be via a localised increase in apoplastic pH via activation of potassium channels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] thereby inducing expansin activity. In the <italic>prc1-1 </italic>mutant this process is affected in several ways. Firstly, the modification of the cell wall structure can cause an apical or basal shift and some smearing of the Rop localisation although as yet it is not understood why this occurs. It is proposed that the normal increase in turgor pressure occurs as in wild-type but since the whole of the <italic>prc1-1 </italic>cell wall may be weak the entire outer face bulges out instead of just the position where Rop is localised. Interestingly root hairs can still be formed from the bulges suggesting that either Rop or another unknown site-specific signal is still able to direct the normal post bulge steps in hair formation.</p><p>It is feasible that <italic>RHD6 </italic>is normally required to direct the cellular machinery causing cell wall loosening and so in an <italic>rhd6 </italic>mutant this does not occur. By placing <italic>rhd6-1 </italic>in a <italic>prc1-1 </italic>mutant background the requirement for cell wall loosening is fulfilled independently of RHD6 and hair initiation can proceed. It is interesting that in <italic>prc1-1/rhd6-1 </italic>roots, <italic>EXP7 </italic>expression is found specifically in cells which are bulged or form a root hair. This indicates that <italic>EXP7 </italic>is an important factor in root hair formation. One intriguing possibility is that EXP7 is induced by radial expansion of trichoblast cells. In wild-type this would require initial loosening of the cell wall possibly via acidification and XET activity. In <italic>rhd6-1 </italic>the cell wall loosening may be blocked and therefore there is no induction of <italic>EXP7</italic>. However in <italic>prc1-1/rhd6-1 </italic>roots the cell wall is already sufficiently weakened in a subset of cells to allow the turgor pressure to cause radial expansion, in turn causing a feedback induction of <italic>EXP7 </italic>expression. This would cause further loosening of the wall and allow root hair formation to proceed.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The <italic>prc1-1 </italic>mutant has provided useful information showing that the cell wall structure influences the morphogenesis of root hairs and also provided information about the role of <italic>RHD6 </italic>in hair formation. By affecting the cell wall structure and composition in the <italic>prc1 </italic>mutant, the requirement for a functional RHD6 in root hair formation can be partially bypassed. However, further work is required to elucidate the complex interplay between the different genetic and physiological factors which combine to determine the site of hair formation and its subsequent biogenesis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Growth of Arabidopsis</title><p>Wild-type (Columbia 0 ecotype) and mutant seed was surface sterilized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] and sown <italic>in vitro </italic>on Murashige and Skoog (MS) agar (4.3 g MS salts (Duchefa, Haarlem, Netherlands); 1 % sucrose, pH 5.8 with 0.5 M KOH; 1 % plant agar; Duchefa, Haarlem, Netherlands).
