To understand the function of the LRS surface in silencing, we performed an EMS mutagenesis screen to identify suppressors of the H3 A75V LRS allele. We identified dominant and recessive mutations in histones H3, H4, and dominant mutations in the BAH (Bromo Adjacent Homology) domain of <italic>SIR3</italic>. We further characterized a surface of Sir3p critical for silencing via the LRS surface. We found that all alleles of the <italic>SIR3</italic> BAH domain were able to 1) generally suppress the loss of telomeric silencing of LRS alleles, but 2) could not suppress SIN (<underline>S</underline>wi/Snf <underline>In</underline>dependent) alleles or 3) could not suppress the telomeric silencing defect of H4 tail alleles. Moreover, we noticed a complementary trend in the electrostatic changes resulting from most of the histone mutations that gain or lose silencing and the suppressor alleles isolated in <italic>SIR3</italic>, and the genes for histones H3 and H4. Mutations in H3 and H4 genes that lose silencing tend to make the LRS surface more electronegative, whereas mutations that increase silencing make it less electronegative. Conversely, suppressors of LRS alleles in either <italic>SIR3</italic>, histone H3, or H4 also tend to make their respective surfaces less electronegative. Our results provide genetic evidence for recent data suggesting that the Sir3p BAH domain directly binds the LRS domain. Based on these findings, we propose an electrostatic model for how an extensive surface on the Sir3p BAH domain may regulate docking onto the LRS surface.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>The chromatin in which eukaryotic DNA is wrapped is organized in nucleosome units, consisting of eight core histone molecules. We study gene silencing, thought to be associated with chromatin compaction in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, which has most of its genome in the form of open chromatin, i.e., the genes are expressed. There are three distinct classes of silent genomic loci associated with such a compact structure; when genes are inserted at these loci, they are subject to silencing, regardless of DNA sequence. Yeast cells distinguish between silent and expressed loci using silencing complexes, concentrated at silent loci, as well as establishing different modification states of silent and expressed chromatin. One of these silencing proteins, Sir3p, is crucial for silencing transcription. Using suppressor genetics, we identified a genetic interaction between a specific surface patch on the nucleosome face (the LRS surface) and Sir3p; the complementary charges of the respective surfaces determine the strength of this key interaction. Genetically guided molecular docking experiments identified electrostatic and steric complementarity between these two surfaces at the molecular level that could help explain both the genetics and the impact of the critical nucleosomal modifications that control silent chromatin formation.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="14"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Previous work identified a nucleosome surface named the LRS domain critically important for silencing at all classically defined silent loci in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000301-Park1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000301-Thompson1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

Bulk nucleosomes are 90&#x00025; methylated at H3K79 and this modification is widely distributed across the euchromatic yeast genome but markedly depleted at heterochromatic mating-type, ribosomal DNA, and telomeric loci. These results suggest that this residue is important for defining euchromatin, and imply that the absence of such methylation defines a silent chromatin ground state <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000301-Ng1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000301-Pokholok1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Most of the genome of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> is in the active state, as genes are densely spaced and most of the genes are expressed under standard laboratory growth conditions. There are three regions of silent chromatin, the silent mating type cassettes or <italic>HM</italic> loci, the telomeres, and the rDNA repeats (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000301-Rusche1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>). Three models have been put forth to explain the role of the LRS domain in silencing: (i) these residues are simply directly required for K79 methylation/Dot1p recognition, (ii) the LRS surface could represent a direct nucleosome-nucleosome interaction surface important for tight packing of nucleosomes and silencing (iii), the surface may represent a site of interaction between the nucleosome and a silencing protein(s) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000301-Park1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>. While there is evidence against the first two models, until recently data supporting the third hypothesis, which we favor, were lacking. The evidence against the first two hypotheses is as follows: i) Most LRS alleles are competent for Dot1p methylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000301-Fry1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>; (ii) despite the fact that many of LRS residues are important for DNA binding, we showed that the LRS surface is not required structurally for condensation of oligonucleosome arrays <italic>in vitro</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000301-Fry1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover, one model for a condensed chromatin fiber, based on the tetranucleosome structure, suggests that LRS surfaces are solvent-exposed and not involved in intimate nucleosome-nucleosome interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000301-Schalch1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. (iii) Data presented here and elsewhere <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000301-Onishi1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000301-vanWelsem1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref> provide evidence that the LRS surface directly binds the Sir3p BAH domain, and this binding is important for silencing at the telomeres.</p><p>In the current model for telomeric silencing, Rap1 and Ku proteins bind directly to telomere chromatin, followed by recruitment of the Sir complex (Sir2/3/4p). Iterative cycles of deacetylation of histone tails, and specifically H4 K16, by Sir2p create high-affinity sites for the Sir 2/3/4 complex in adjacent nucleosomes, allowing spreading of silent chromatin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000301-Hoppe1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000301-Tanny1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. The encroachment of silent chromatin from silent loci into neighboring euchromatin is prevented by several redundant mechanisms. The modification of residues of H3 K4 and H3 K79 and H4 K16 are important for telomeric silencing. Methylation of both H3 K4 and K79 and acetylation of H4 K16 in active chromatin are needed to restrict Sir3p to silent chromatin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000301-Ng1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000301-Singer1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000301-Venkatasubrahmanyam1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000301-Carmen1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. Recent work has given insight into how these modifications restrict silent chromatin. These data suggest that Sir3p and Dot1p, the methyl transferase for H3 K79, compete for binding of overlapping nucleosome surfaces consisting of the short basic patch of the H4 tail surrounding K16 as well as the region of the nucleosome core surrounding H3 K79 (the LRS surface), for overall chromatin binding affinity. Importantly, the Sir3p <italic>in vitro</italic> interaction is inhibited by both H4 K16 acetylation and H3 K79 methylation, whereas Dot1p binds irrespective of K16 acetylation status <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000301-Onishi1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000301-Altaf1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000301-Millar1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. This scheme sets up a two fold level of regulation, the first level of competition between for the Sas2p, the H4 K16 acetyl transferase and Sir2p, the deacetylase, for the acetylation status of H4 K16 affects the second level of competition between Dot1p and Sir3p for the nucleosome surface. The region of Sir3p that is responsible for binding the nucleosome, and whether the interaction is direct remains unclear. Yeast two hybrid, <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> studies implicated the Sir3p C-terminus in interaction with Sir4p, Rap1p, itself, H3 and H4 tails, and the region around H3 K79 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000301-Luo1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000301-Cockell1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000301-Johnson1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>.

This result strongly supports a model in which Sir3p interacted directly with the LRS domain at the telomeres but did not rule out an indirect effect.

The SIN surface is located at the dyad axis, where the DNA enters and exits the nucleosome. The <italic>sin</italic> mutant alleles partially bypass the need for the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, are defective in nucleosome array formation, and defective for telomeric silencing.

If there were a specific interaction between the LRS surface and the Sir3p BAH domain we would expect the <italic>SIR3</italic> alleles to suppress the LRS mutants' defect in telomeric silencing but not the defects of SIN or other alleles.

To provide further evidence against an indirect mechanism we localized Sir3p using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) to telomeric DNA in wild-type or H3 A75V strains with the <italic>SIR3</italic> alleles D205N and L79I.

Interestingly, Sir3-D205Np and Sir3-L79Ip also bind wild-type telomeric nucleosomes more efficiently than does wild-type Sir3p, suggesting a gain of function in these mutant proteins. The efficiency of Sir3p telomeric localization does not entirely parallel the telomeric silencing phenotype as assayed by the <italic>URA3</italic> and <italic>ADE2</italic> reporters.

These results are all consistent with the hypothesis that electronegative regions of the nucleosome and Sir3 normally repel each other in wild-type yeast to some extent and it is the slightly unstable nature of this interaction that underlies silencing. Thus what the mutants do is decrease repulsion, which presumably increases nucleosome binding. Our genetics suggested that two surfaces, one on the nucleosome and one on Sir3p, could directly interact. To this end, we performed studies to attempt to dock the BAH domain on the nucleosome using the mutated &#x0201c;patches&#x0201d; of these surfaces as guides. Considering the large positively charged stretch of amino acids 24 and 34 in <italic>SIR3</italic> we surmised that this section was likely to lie in proximity to the DNA. Additionally, there is a deep cleft in the nucleosome neighboring the LRS domain created by the H2B-H4 four helix bundle at the interface between the H2A/B dimer and the H3/4 tetramer (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000301-g007">Figure 7A and 7B</xref>). Guided by these constraints, the helix &#x003b1;8 of the BAH domain was readily docked into this cleft, maintaining the packing of the &#x003b1;-helices of H4 and H2B that make up the proposed docking site (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000301-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). The area buried in this structure is approximately 2300 &#x000c5;<sup>2</sup>, consistent with a strong interaction. Importantly, this configuration directly juxtaposes the LRS domain with the surface of the BAH domain identified here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000301-g007">Figure 7A&#x02013;7F</xref>). We looked deeper into the structure to find evidence of consistent electrostatic interactions between the two proteins. Remarkably, we found that many residues of both surfaces not only line up well, with few clashes, but importantly, we found adjacencies/interactions consistent with the observed silencing-inhibitory and silencing-enhancing mutations isolated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000301-g007">Figure 7</xref>). The most frequently isolated <italic>SIR3</italic> suppressor mutants were <italic>D205N</italic>, <italic>L138P</italic>, and <italic>W86R</italic>. The importance of these residues in the docking structure are demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000301-g007">Figure 7E and 7F</xref>. <italic>SIR3 D205</italic> and <italic>L138</italic> are all in close proximity (within 5 &#x000c5;) to each other and to H3 K79. Given the importance of H3 K79 methylation in Sir3p binding to the nucleosome, we also found in this proposed docking scheme that tri-methylation of H3 K79 is predicted to sterically hinder binding of Sir3p to the LRS surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000301-g007">Figure 7E</xref>). <italic>SIR3 W86</italic> is within 5 &#x000c5; of H3 T80, H3 D81 and H4 K79. A substitution of an arginine (R) at position W86 could enhance an electrostatic interaction between H3 D81 and Sir3p. Also H3 D77 makes potentially inhibitory repulsive interactions with Sir3p-E178 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000301-g007">Figure 7C</xref>), which would be ameliorated by introduction of glycine (G) or asparagine (N) residues into either partner. There are of course stabilizing interactions that would not necessarily be revealed by our mutagenesis but were revealed in the docking study. While our genetic data revealed important side-chains in limiting the interaction between Sir3p and the nucleosome, the docking model showed that there are potential attractive forces as well, namely the &#x003b1;7 helix of the Sir3p BAH domain makes favorable contacts with helices &#x003b1;C and &#x003b1;3 of H2B.</p><fig id="pgen-1000301-g007" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1000301.g007</object-id><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>Model for Sir3p BAH domain binding to the LRS surface.</title><p>The 2Fl7 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000301-Hou1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref> crystal structure was docked to the 1ID3 nucleosome structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000301-White1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>.

At the outset of our investigation we had evidence arguing against the first two models. 1) We found that LRS alleles are not intrinsically deficient in H3 K79 methylation as evaluated by immunoblot or <italic>in vitro</italic> Dot1 methylation assays. Although a few alleles are deficient in methylation, most are not. Therefore, recruitment of Dot1p to effect H3 K79 methylation cannot be the sole function of the LRS surface. 2) The H3 R83A allele, unlike its structurally equivalent H4 R45C SIN allele, is competent to form oligonucleosome arrays <italic>in vitro</italic> by sedimentation analysis, arguing against an inter-nucleosomal interaction defect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000301-Fry1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>To genetically probe the function of the LRS surface, we used EMS mutagenesis to find suppressors of H3 A75V loss of telomeric silencing. In this screen almost half of the mutations were in histone H3 and H4 genes. Remarkably, all the remaining chromosomal mutations, which were dominant and therefore difficult to characterize, were subsequently found to map to <italic>SIR3</italic> and to have point mutations in the Sir3p BAH domain that accounted for the suppressor phenotype. This fact alone provides strong evidence consistent with a Sir3p BAH - LRS surface interaction underlying silencing. However, it was formally possible that the Sir3p BAH domain could have an indirect effect on the LRS surface. We have three additional lines of evidence that argue against such an indirect effect. (i) <italic>SIR3</italic> suppressor alleles restore Sir3p binding to telomeric DNA in H3-A75V mutants (ii) the electrostatic alterations in the mutants in H3 that lose silencing, and the H3-A75V suppressing mutants in <italic>SIR3</italic> and <italic>hht2</italic> (H3) that restore that silencing, suggest complementary physical interactions, and (iii) <italic>SIR3</italic> suppressor mutant residues lie in a contiguous surface similar in dimensions to the LRS surface.</p><p>To provide evidence for a direct LRS-Sir3p interaction we used ChIP analysis of Sir3p and we did indeed find that the LRS mutant H3-A75V was completely defective in binding Sir3p to telomeric chromatin, and that both Sir3p-D205N and Sir3p-L79I completely restored the binding. Based on targeted mutagenesis of the BAH domain of <italic>SIR3</italic> we were able to further genetically define the surface of Sir3p important for suppression of LRS alleles. We also noted that both the D205N mutation and 69&#x00025; of the mutants found in the targeted mutagenesis study decreased the negative charge of the Sir3p BAH domain, distinctly complementary to the electrostatic trend seen in the H3 A75V histone H3/H4 suppressors located in the LRS domain, raising the possibility that decreasing charge compatibility would decrease nucleosome/BAH affinity and increasing it would restore binding. To test the notion that such charge complementarity may function between the LRS surface and the BAH domain we tested the allele specificity of the <italic>SIR3</italic> suppressor mutants, and found that <italic>SIR3</italic> mutants were able to generally suppress the loss of telomeric silencing of LRS surface mutations, but were not classically allele-specific. Why weren't we able to isolate residue-specific suppressors? The LRS surface may be important for binding to several different proteins/complexes, and a general electrostatic interaction could allow the surface to bind different factors at different loci. While we provide evidence that Sir3p binds to the LRS surface at telomeres, these <italic>SIR3</italic> alleles do not suppress H3-A75V's loss of rDNA silencing. It will be interesting to determine whether other BAH domain containing proteins such as Orc1p, Rsc1p or Rsc2p can bind the LRS surface at other loci in the yeast genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000301-Callebaut1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000301-Triolo1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Complementary Surfaces Underlie the Sir3p-Nucleosome Interaction</title><p>In this mutational study suppressor mutations were used to inform docking experiments between the Sir3p BAH domain and the LRS surface. The interaction between the LRS surface and the Sir3p BAH domain is determined by charge complementarity and surface complementarity, an improvement in either type of complementarity can suppress defects in either type of complementarity. Based on this docking we did find residue-specific interactions consistent with our genetics, and found that the key residues H3 K79 and H3 D77 could play critical roles in stabilizing the docked structure. Specifically, H3 K79 could interact with Sir3p residues W86, L138, and D205, all of which would be inhibited by tri-methylation of H3 K79; such inhibition is presumably steric, i.e. reducing surface complementarity. Additionally, substitutions of H3 D77 are the strongest suppressors of H3 A75V, suppressing both its telomeric and rDNA silencing phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000301-g002">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000301-g003">3</xref>). Based on the idea that electrostatics underlie LRS surface function, and based on our docking experiments, we predict that H3 D77 normally makes potentially inhibitory interactions with Sir3p E178 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000301-g007">Figure 7</xref>), hence the D77N and D77G substitutions most likely function by increasing Sir3p/nucleosome affinity. H3 D77 is important for inhibitory interactions with Sir3p residues, whereas Sir3p D205 maintains inhibitory interactions with both H3 and H4, all of which could be ameliorated by a decrease in negative charge as seen in all of the substitutions of aspartic acid (D) at position 205 of <italic>SIR3</italic> suppressors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000301-g007">Figure 7</xref>). Repulsion of electronegative forces limit the interaction of Sir3p BAH domain and the LRS nucleosomal domains, and hence decreasing them leads to greater affinity. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000301-g001">Figure 1</xref> shows an electronegative region abutting the LRS region; mutations that remove any positive charge from the LRS surface lead to loss of silencing. We also predict that Sir3p W86 does not normally make inhibitory interactions but introduction of an (R) Arginine could improve interactions with the nucleosome by creating a salt bridge with H3 D81 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000301-g007">Figure 7F</xref>). Not all substitutions in Sir3p BAH domain would improve electrostatic complementarity, in fact many of the suppressor mutants change hydrophobic residues, for example L79I and L138P. We predict that altering these side-chains improves surface complementarity between the BAH domain of Sir3p and the LRS surface. The attractive forces may involve the positively charged H4 N-terminal tail and/or the H2B &#x003b1;-C helix that abuts the &#x003b1;7 Sir3p helix; there are many complementary charge interactions.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Indirect and Direct Histone Suppressor Alleles</title><p>Whereas the majority of the H3 A75V suppressor mutations in histones mapped to the LRS surface, three suppressor mutations, H3 R39K, H4 A15V and H4 H75Y are elsewhere.

Investigating the function of these alleles, Smith <italic>et al.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000301-Smith1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref> demonstrated that H4 A15V decreases the acetylation of H4 K16, which in turn interferes with Sir3p binding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000301-Onishi1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000301-Altaf1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000301-Hecht1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. Presumably, decreasing the acetylation state of K16 tips the balance toward Sir3p binding at the expense of Dot1p, and thereby increases silencing. Losing H4 K16 acetylation all together could actually hinder silencing because of a dilution effect on silencing complexes, which explains why a H4 K16R mutation or a <italic>sas2</italic> deletion can lead to loss of telomeric silencing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000301-KatanKhaykovich1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. The suppressor mutations H3 R39K and H4 H75Y are more difficult to reconcile.

Additionally, they predicted that a substitution of tyrosine for histidine could increase the H2B/H4 interaction. Considering the proposed docking of the Sir3 BAH domain onto the nucleosome, an increase in stability between H4 and H2B could enhance Sir3p binding and hence increase silencing. Alternatively, the decreased interaction of H75Y with Asf1, predicted to decrease nucleosome disassembly/assembly thereby increasing telomeric silencing could explain its suppression of H3 A75V <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000301-English1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. Recently H3 R39, along with the residues N terminal to it, was co-crystallized with histone chaperone RbAp46. This residue may have a similar effect as H75Y, except not on the nucleosomal structure itself. Instead this mutation may alter a histone/chaperone interaction, which is important for disassembly/assembly processes that affect telomeric silencing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000301-Murzina1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>The BAH Domain and the Evolution of Silencing Mechanisms</title><p>Homologs of <italic>SIR3</italic> have not been found in other fungal taxa outside of <italic>Saccharomyces</italic>. However, all eukaryotes share an essential replication protein, Orc1p, the N-terminus of which consists of a BAH domain similar to that of Sir3p. This fact suggests that Sir3p's role in silencing was recently acquired in evolution, and study of the two proteins' sequence might give some hints as to functional constraints on their evolution. The similarity in structures suggests that Orc1p's BAH domain might also contact the LRS surface as part of its role in defining origins of replication.

Approximately 5&#x000d7;10<sup>5</sup> log phase cells of both the pool and each individual suppressor strain were mixed well in 1 mL YPD.

The Sir3p structural model (PDB ID 2FL7) was manually docked in the nucleosome (PDB ID 1ID3) in a nucleosome cleft abutting the LRS surface. This cleft, formed by the interface between H3/H4 and H2B/H2A, shows surface complementarity with Sir3p's &#x003b1;8 helix. The Sir3p surface is at an optimal distance from the LRS surface to allow the interaction between the regions in Sir3p and the nucleosome that affect silencing. The orientation of Sir3p BAH domain in the complex was guided by the assumption that the basic region (residues 24&#x02013;34), which is disordered in the crystal structure, interacts with the negatively charged DNA backbone. Protein-protein contacts were optimized only by modifications of the side chain conformations. Initially, suitable side chain conformations were selected from a library of rotamers and further optimized by energy minimization using CHARMm32 (Accelerys) as the force field. Only the side chain atoms of both proteins were allowed to move during the optimization, with all other atoms constrained in a fixed position. Areas buried for the modeled SIR3/nucleosome complex were calculated using the program NACCESS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000301-Hubbard1">&#x0005b;60&#x0005d;</xref>.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pgen.1000301.s001"><label>Dataset S1</label><caption><p>Sir3p_model.pdb</p><p>(0.12 MB TXT)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pgen.1000301.s001.txt" mimetype="text" mime-subtype="plain"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pgen.1000301.s002"><label>Dataset S2</label><caption><p>nucleosome_model.pdb</p><p>(0.95 MB TXT)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pgen.1000301.s002.txt" mimetype="text" mime-subtype="plain"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank the Boeke lab, the &#x0201c;silencing&#x0201d; group, Kate O'Donnel, Bobby Yarrington, Edel Hyland, Junbiao Dai, and Yu-Yi Lin, for helpful discussions.
