Alignment of rpS5/rpS7 from metazoans (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>), fungi (<italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>) and bacteria (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>) shows that the proteins contain a conserved central/C-terminal core region and possess variable N-terminal regions. Yeast rpS5 is 69 amino acids (aa) longer than the <italic>E. coli</italic> rpS7 protein; and human rpS5 is 48 aa longer than the rpS7, respectively. To investigate the function of the yeast rpS5 and in particular the role of its N-terminal region, we obtained and characterized yeast strains in which the wild-type yeast rpS5 was replaced by its truncated variants, lacking 13, 24, 30 and 46 N-terminal amino acids, respectively. All mutant yeast strains were viable and displayed only moderately reduced growth rates, with the exception of the strain lacking 46 N-terminal amino acids, which had a doubling time of about 3 h. Biochemical analysis of the mutant yeast strains suggests that the N-terminal part of the eukaryotic and, in particular, yeast rpS5 may impact the ability of 40S subunits to function properly in translation and affect the efficiency of initiation, specifically the recruitment of initiation factors eIF3 and eIF2.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Despite a large body of information provided by X-ray analysis of prokaryotic ribosomes, the role of many prokaryotic ribosomal proteins (rp&#x02019;s) remains rather obscure. Even less is known about the functions of eukaryotic rp&#x02019;s. Thirty-four rp families are present in all the domains of life, and 33 additional families are specific to Archaea and Eucarya (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). Apparently, these proteins have evolved to play distinct roles in archaeal and eukaryotic ribosome biogenesis, structure and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Many rp&#x02019;s (like eukaryotic rp L9; homolog of prokaryotic L6) show an extremely high degree of conservation and display very little variation in size and amino acid (aa) composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3 B4">1&#x02013;4</xref>). Others possess less pronounced similarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3 B4">1&#x02013;4</xref>). Interestingly, the proportion of universally conserved rp&#x02019;s is higher in the small ribosomal subunit (two-thirds are conserved), whereas only 50% of the rp&#x02019;s are conserved in the large ribosomal subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). This high degree of conservation of rp&#x02019;s from the small ribosomal subunit has been attributed to the higher degree of conservation of the small subunit ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and the rRNA regions with which they interact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Yet, many details of the evolution of sequence and structure of rp&#x02019;s from both small and large ribosomal subunits are unclear and remain to be established.</p><p>rpS5 belongs to a family of conserved rp&#x02019;s that includes bacterial rpS7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). rpS5/7 proteins share about 30% identity at the aa level and possess a conserved central/C-terminal region and variable N-terminal ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4 B5 B6">4&#x02013;6</xref>). The extreme carboxy-terminal 16 aa of the rpS5/S7 proteins are extremely conserved in all organisms spanning several kingdoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4 B5 B6">4&#x02013;6</xref>). This suggests that this region of the rpS5 and rpS7 proteins serves an important function. The protein forms part of the exit (E) site on the 30S/40S ribosomal subunits and contributes to the formation of the mRNA exit channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). The high degree of sequence similarity between rpS5 and rpS7 and their location suggest conservation of function(s) of this protein in the ribosome. Indeed, mutations in rpS7/S5 are detrimental for the cell function and/or can significantly perturb the translation process, leading to an increased capacity for frameshifting and read-through (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). In contrast to the high degree of conservation of the C-terminal region, the rpS5/S7 proteins show variability in aa sequence composition and length at the N-terminal end. It is evident that many fungal and insect (fly) rpS5 proteins are the longest and prokaryotic rpS7 proteins are the shortest members of this family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> rpS5 is 69 aa longer than the <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> rpS7 (strain O6) protein; and human rpS5 is 48 aa longer than the <italic>E. coli</italic> rpS7, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). The reason why eukaryotes and in particular fungi have evolved a longer rpS5 protein is not clear. <fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Alignments of amino acid sequences of ribosomal proteins S7/S5. <italic>E. coli</italic> strain O6:H1/CFT073 (NP_755978), <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> rpS5 (NP_012657) and <italic>H. sapiens</italic> rpS5 (NP_001000) have been used.

We concluded that the negatively charged N-terminal extension of yeast rpS5 might affect the ribosomal recruitment of specific mRNAs as well as play important roles in ensuring the efficiency and fidelity of elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Although human rpS5 is 67% identical and 79% similar to <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> rpS5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>), it nevertheless could not be excluded that the observed differences between the wild-type (wt) and humanized yeast strains were due to the overall dissimilarity of the yeast and human rpS5 proteins, rather than to the dissimilarity of their N-terminal regions.</p><p>To further investigate the function of the yeast rpS5 and to better understand the role of the N-terminal region of the eukaryotic protein, we obtained and characterized yeast strains in which the wt yeast rpS5 was replaced by its truncated variants, lacking 13, 24, 30 and 46 N-terminal amino acids, respectively. Our data further corroborated our previous observations, suggesting that the N-terminal part of the yeast S5 plays important roles in ensuring the efficiency and accuracy of elongation as well as initiation processes and may in addition play important roles in recruiting certain initiation factors to the 40S ribosome.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Yeast strains and growth methods</title><p>Yeast strains used in this study are: Research Genetics (Huntsville, AL, USA) WT haploid BY4741 (<italic>MATa, his3-1, leu2-0, met15-0, ura3-0</italic>), diploid BY4743 (<italic>[4741/4742] MATa/MAT&#x003b1;, his3-1/his3-1, leu2-0/leu2-0, lys2-0/+, met15-0/+, ura3-0/ura3-0, RPS5/rps5::kanMX</italic>).

To determine whether truncated rpS5 proteins can substitute for the full-length yeast rpS5 protein we have used an approach that ensures that truncated rpS5 proteins in the mutant strains will be expressed at levels equal to that of the full-length yeast rpS5 in the wt strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). In eukaryotic cells, and, particularly in yeast, balanced expression of rp&#x02019;s is achieved at the post-transcriptional level, through the regulated turnover of rp&#x02019;s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27 B28 B29">27&#x02013;29</xref>). Rp&#x02019;s that are present in excess are rapidly degraded until they reach levels identical to other rp&#x02019;s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27 B28 B29">27&#x02013;29</xref>).

An initiation (ATG) codon was added to all of the truncated gene variants to insure that translation of all the mRNA would be initiated properly. All rpS5 variants were placed under the control of the constitutive (<italic>TEF</italic>) promoter (derived from the elongation factor 1A gene), because the <italic>TEF</italic> gene belongs to the cluster of rp genes and its expression is tightly co-regulated with the expression of rp&#x02019;s in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>).

Tetrad dissection analysis revealed that in the case of yeast strains carrying either the full-length rpS5, or gene/protein variants lacking 13, 24, 30 and 46 aa residues all four spores were viable; however, further truncation of rpS5 protein (by 50 aa) resulted in two inviable spores (data not shown) suggesting that an rpS5 gene variant encoding rpS5 lacking 50 N-terminal aa is not able to complement the full-length gene. PCR analysis using chromosomal DNA isolated from yeast clones showed that two of four viable spores contained a disrupted copy of the yeast <italic>RPS5</italic> gene (data not shown). Thus, rpS5 variants expressed from the plasmid were the sole source of rpS5 in these strains, and we therefore concluded that they substitute for the full-length protein <italic>in vivo.</italic> The BY4743 strain transformed with the empty p425TEF plasmid (2 &#x000b5;, <italic>LEU2</italic>) gave rise to only two viable colonies after sporulation and tetrad dissection, confirming that rpS5 is essential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>) for yeast viability (data not shown).

It should be noted that the haploid BY47yS5 strain carrying the full-length copy of the <italic>RPS5</italic> gene expressed from the plasmid displayed growth rates equal to that of the haploid BY4741 strain; however, the BY47yS5-13, BY47yS5-24, BY47yS5-30 strains displayed moderately reduced (15&#x02013;25%) growth rates in comparison with the BY4741 and BY47yS5 yeast strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). The BY47yS5-46 strain revealed substantial reduction in growth rates, when grown on either rich YEPD medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A) or minimal SD medium (data not shown) in comparison with the BY47yS5 yeast strain. The doubling time for this strain at 30&#x000b0;C in liquid YEPD glucose medium was &#x0223c;3&#x02013;3.2 h, whereas for all other strains it is &#x0223c;1.5&#x02013;1.7 h.</p><p>The expression levels of yrpS5 proteins in the wt and all the mutant yeast strains were determined by western blotting using an antibody directed against the AIKKKDELERVAKSNR C-terminally conserved rpS5 peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>).

The polyribosome: 80S monosome ratio is indicative of the efficiency of translation initiation. Sucrose density-gradient centrifugation analysis of cytoplasmic extracts prepared from the BY47yS5-0, BY47yS5-13, BY47yS5-24, BY47yS5-30 and BY47yS5-46 strains showed that protein synthesis is not severely perturbed in BY47yS5-13 and BY47yS5-24 strains in comparison with the BY47yS5-0 strain carrying the full-length copy of rpS5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>). The polysome (P) to monosome (80S) ratios were 2.25 : 1, 3.10 : 1 and 3.43 : 1 for the BY47yS5-0, BY47yS5-13 and BY47yS5-24 strains, respectively. Both the BY47yS5-13 and BY47yS5-24 strains displayed a moderate increase in the heavy polyribosomal components similar to what we observed previously for the strain carrying a copy of the human rpS5 protein, which is 21 aa shorter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Further truncation of yeast rpS5 by 9 aa (strain BY47yS5-30) resulted in a reduction in the polysome: 80 monosome ratio (1.47 : 1) characteristic of a reduced rate of translation initiation. However, truncation of the protein by 46 aa resulted in more severe changes in polysome : 80 monosome ratio (0.87 : 1 in the BY47yS5-46 strain). Western blot analysis showed that all the rpS5 variants (including the rpS5-46 protein) were present in fractions containing 40S subunits, 80S ribosomes and polyribosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>); thus, confirming that the truncated proteins are stable components of mutant ribosomes and are actively involved in protein synthesis. These data suggest that truncation of rpS5 by 30 and 46 aa residues might significantly impair translation initiation.</p><p>Additional evidence supporting this conclusion came from experiments utilizing a reporter plasmid carrying the lacZ gene under control of the <italic>GAL1</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). These experiments showed that LacZ expression in the mutant strains expressing rpS5-13 and rpS5-24 proteins was only mildly reduced (by &#x0223c;10&#x02013;15%) compared to the strain expressing the full-length protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A). However, LacZ expression in the strain expressing the rpS5-30 protein was reduced by &#x0223c;30%, and in the strain expressing the rpS5-46 protein was reduced by more than 50%. These results corroborate the data from polyribosome analysis and suggested that cap-dependent translation is impaired in the strains expressing rpS5 lacking 30 and 46 amino N-terminal acid residues. Interestingly, expression mediated by the <italic>URE2</italic> internal ribosome entry site (IRES) in the mutant BY47yS5-13, BY47yS5-24 and BY47yS5-30 strains was about 50% higher than in the BY47yS5-0 strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>B). <italic>URE2</italic> IRES-mediated expression was measured using the previously described Ure2p-lacZ reporter vector, in which the <italic>URE2</italic> IRES was inserted in frame in front of the lacZ reporter gene but behind a stable hairpin structure (&#x00394;<italic>G</italic> &#x0003e; &#x02212;30 kcal/mol), which abolished cap-dependent lacZ expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>). This suggests that, particularly in the BY47yS5-30 strain, it is cap-dependent initiation which becomes impaired. However, further truncation of rpS5 in BY47yS5-46 also results in reduction of IRES-mediated translation.</p></sec><sec><title>Ribosome biogenesis is not severely affected in the mutant yeast strains carrying rpS5 proteins lacking 13, 24, 30 and 46 aa residues from the N-terminal end</title><p>Rp&#x02019;s that maintain the structural integrity of mature ribosomal subunits including rpS5 have been suggested to play important roles in ribosome biogenesis and intracellular transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33 B34 B35">33&#x02013;35</xref>). Therefore, it could not be completely excluded that the observed defects in translation initiation, particularly in the BY47yS5-30 and BY47yS5-46 strains, might in part be related to the affected biogenesis of 40S ribosomal subunits leading to their reduced amounts in the mutant yeast cells. However, analysis of the ratios of 40S&#x02013;60S subunits done under conditions of low Mg<sup>2+</sup>, when polyribosomes and 80S ribosomes dissociate into free ribosomal subunits, does not support this suggestion. The isogenic BY47yS5-0, BY47yS5-13, BY47yS5-24, BY47yS5-30 and BY47yS5-46 strains had very similar amounts of 40S and 60S subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>). This suggests that the observed drop in polyribosome fractions and increase in 80S ribosomes, particularly in the BY47yS5-46, strain could most probably be attributed to the inability of mutant 40S subunits (containing truncated rpS5 protein lacking 46 N-terminal amino acids) to function properly in initiation, rather than to the reduced amounts of 40S subunits due to affected 40S biogenesis. Additional evidence supporting this observation came from the analysis of rRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>). We have not observed any substantial changes in 25S/18S ratios between the strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>) and/or the appearance of the unprocessed 20S pre-rRNA species that would be indicative of affected 40S subunit biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>).

While catalysis of peptide bond formation does not seem to require rp&#x02019;s, other steps in the translation process do involve rp&#x02019;s, which participate in a variety of activities such as recruitment of tRNAs and/or translation factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3 B4">1&#x02013;4</xref>). In addition, the additional rp&#x02019;s present in the eukaryotic ribosome were suggested to stabilize eukaryote-specific rRNA expansion segments, participate in ribosomal biogenesis and play an important role in translational control of gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Interestingly, the 34 rp families that are present in all the domains of life are not identical and exhibit varying degrees of similarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>).

The mutant yeast strains were all viable and their growth rates were only moderately (&#x0223c;15&#x02013;25%) reduced, with the exception of the strain expressing the rpS5-46 truncation mutant, which displayed a more than 2-fold reduction in growth rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>A). This result suggests that the N-terminal &#x0223c;25 aa of yeast rpS5 may play only a modulatory role in the function of the yeast ribosome, whereas more distal amino acid residues play a considerably more important role in yeast cell physiology, likely in key steps of the translation process. The increase in levels of 80S ribosomes and the significant reduction in polyribosomal fractions in the BY47yS5-30 and BY47yS5-46 mutant strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>) suggest a significant defect in the translation initiation step. It has previously been shown that altered expression of almost any single rp of the small subunit (including rpS5) in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> affects ribosome biogenesis and limits ribosome production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>). Interestingly, Woolford <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>) reported that the carboxy-terminal extension of rpS14 is required for maturation of 43S preribosomes in yeast and is important for the late (cytoplasmic) steps of 40S subunit assembly. RpS14 resides on the 40S subunit&#x02019;s platform in close proximity to the E-site and rpS5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Although the exact location of the rpS5 N-terminal region is not known (especially relative to rpS14&#x02019;s carboxy-terminus), it could not be excluded that the N-terminal extension of rpS5 might play a role in 40S subunit maturation. However, the 40S:60S subunit and 18S:25S rRNA ratios were not significantly affected in the mutant strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>), indicating that the increase in 80S ribosomes and reduction in the polyribosomal pool in these strains most likely reflect the inability of the mutant 40S subunits to function properly in translation, rather than the impairment of their biogenesis. This in turn suggests that the N-terminal region of rpS5 is essential for translational activity, rather than for ribosomal biogenesis. However, although we did not observe a major ribosome biogenesis defect in mutant strains, the slightly reduced levels of 40S ribosomes, particularly in the BY47yS5-30 and BY47yS5-46 strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>), might nevertheless contribute to the translation initiation defect.</p><p>The results of polyribosome analysis were corroborated by our experiments directly assaying cap-dependent initiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A), which showed that this process was almost unaffected in the BY47yS5-13 and BY47yS5-24 strains, but was reduced in the BY47yS5-30 and BY47yS5-46 strains by &#x0223c;30% and more than 50%, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A). Interestingly, although translation driven by the <italic>URE2</italic> IRES was also reduced by 50% in the BY47yS5-46 strain, in contrast to cap-mediated translation, it was enhanced by &#x0223c;50% in the mutant BY47yS5-13, BY47yS5-24 and BY47yS5-30 strains. However, it is difficult to comment on the basis for the observed differences between cap-dependent and IRES-mediated translation in these three mutant strains because the mechanism of initiation on the <italic>URE2</italic> IRES is unknown. Reduction of both cap-dependent and IRES-mediated translation (by about 50%) in the BY47yS5-46 strain, on the other hand, suggests more general translation defects, which might be attributable to the affected association of the general translation initiation factors eIF2 and eIF3 with the mutant 40S subunits, which is discussed below.</p><p>The translational fidelity of the mutant strains was altered relative to the wt Y47yS5-0 strain, displaying moderately to severely increased levels of frameshifting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>A) as well as a mildly altered ability to recognize stop codons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F7">Figure 7</xref>B). Interestingly, all effects were rather minor in the BY47yS5-13, BY47yS5-24 and BY47yS5-30 strains, whereas the BY47yS5-46 strain displayed a more than 10-fold increase in programmed &#x02212;1 frameshifting and a &#x0223c;2-fold increase in the read-through of the UGA stop codon. However, the +1 frameshifting and recognition of UAG and UAA stop codons were less affected in all the mutant yeast strains compared to the wt strain. The observation that the translational fidelity of mutant ribosomes with a modified rpS5 (and hence a modified E-site) was generally altered is consistent with previous suggestions that the E-site is allosterically coupled to the A-site and that this coupling controls the ability of the ribosomes to discriminate between cognate and noncognate tRNAs at the A-site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>). It cannot be excluded that the altered structure of the E-site might also affect the structure of the adjacent P-site due to its proximity. Codon&#x02013;anticodon mismatches in the P-site have been found to compromise tRNA selection fidelity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>).</p><p>However, the observation that initiation was significantly more affected by mutation of rpS5 than elongation or termination steps suggests that the N-terminal region of eukaryotic rpS5 that is absent in prokaryotes (in particular, residues 25&#x02013;46) may have evolved specifically to control certain steps in eukaryotic initiation, possibly involving ribosomal recruitment of initiation factors. Consistently, association of eIF3 with mutant 40S subunits decreased, whereas association of eIF2 increased in the BY47yS5-30 and BY47yS5-46 strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">Figure 8</xref>). In this respect, it is significant that the five-lobed mammalian eIF3 was modeled onto a protein-rich area on the solvent side of the 40S subunit with its left &#x02018;arm&#x02019; in close proximity to rpS5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>). eIF3 is critical for ribosomal recruitment of mRNA, and simultaneous depletion of its eIF3a and eIF3b subunits in yeast led to a strong reduction in the formation of 48S initiation complexes and to accumulation of mRNA-free 80S ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>). The overall increase in mRNA-free 80S ribosomes observed in the rpS5 mutant stains is consistent with reduced levels in them of eIF3 associated with 40S subunits, and as a consequence, with a presumable defect in recruitment of mRNA to 40S ribosomal complexes. However, it was previously reported that although a 90% reduction in eIF3 binding to yeast 40S subunits had more a dramatic effect on recruitment of mRNA to 40S subunits (also a 90% reduction), it also resulted in a &#x0223c;50% reduction in ribosomal recruitment of eIF2&#x02013;ternary complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>), whereas in our study, the level of association of eIF2 with 40S subunit in mutant stains actually increased. In mammalian ribosomal initiation complexes, the eIF2 &#x003b1;-subunit is situated in very close proximity to rpS5 because both, rpS5 and eIF2&#x003b1;, cross-linked to the same &#x02013;3 position on mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>). Thus, N-terminal truncation of rpS5 could potentially either directly affect recruitment of eIF2-ternary complexes to 40S subunits or influence ribosomal association of eIF2 by modulating eIF5-stimulated hydrolysis of eIF2-bound GTP or subsequent dissociation of eIF2-GDP. Further <italic>in vitro</italic> biochemical analysis is required to determine the exact steps in initiation that are affected by truncation of rpS5.</p><p>In conclusion, taken together, the data presented here indicate that the N-terminal region of eukaryotic rpS5 is important for efficient translation initiation, maintenance of the translation reading frame, stop codon recognition and likely also influences ribosomal association of initiation factors eIF3 and eIF2.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>Funding for open access charge: The National American Heart Association (grant 0730120N to A.A.K.).</p><p><italic>Conflict of interest statement</italic>.
