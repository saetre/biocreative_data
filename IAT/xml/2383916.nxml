They are controlled by an autonomous circadian clock, which can be synchronized to the environmental day-night cycle. In mammals, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), a structure in the ventral part of the hypothalamus, appears to be the main coordinator of the circadian timing system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] synchronizing peripheral clocks present in all tissues throughout the body [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>The oscillatory mechanism underlying the circadian clock has been unraveled by means of genetic analysis in <italic>Drosophila </italic>and mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In the latter, a heterodimeric complex of two transcriptional activators, CLOCK and BMAL1, binds to E-box enhancer elements present in the promoters of target genes and thereby activates the expression of three <italic>Period </italic>(<italic>Per1</italic>, <italic>Per2 </italic>and <italic>Per3</italic>) and two <italic>Cryptochrome </italic>genes (<italic>Cry1 </italic>and <italic>Cry2</italic>).

The positive (CLOCK-BMAL1) and negative (CRY, PER) arms of the feedback loop are coupled via the nuclear orphan receptor REV-ERB&#x003b1; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] generating a stabilized feedback loop that drives recurrent rhythms in mRNA and protein levels of clock components.</p><p>Transcriptional reporter assays, yeast two-hybrid screens and co-immunoprecipitation experiments have been successfully used to identify molecular interactions of clock components at the protein level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Interactions of BMAL1 with CLOCK, NPAS2, DEC1 and DEC2 have been identified. Furthermore it has been suggested that the transactivation activity of BMAL1 is mediated by interaction with CREB binding protein (CBP) or p300 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>Many different approaches have been employed to characterize the interactions between the repressors PER2, CRY1 and CRY2 and the BMAL1-CLOCK heterodimer, but still the picture is far from being clear. It is thought that CRY1 plays a key role in repressing the transcriptional activation potential of the heterodimer, and recently, various attempts have been made to elucidate the mechanism by which interaction of CRY1 with BMAL1 and/or CLOCK inhibits transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. However, many of these studies use multimeric protein complexes, which do not always satisfactorily identify the exact interactions between two individual components of the complex.</p><p>We decided to choose a complementary approach and to investigate the interactions of PER2, CRY1 and CRY2 with BMAL1 and CLOCK using a mammalian two-hybrid system where we only overexpressed two of the components &#x02013; one part of the activating heterodimer and one repressor &#x02013; at a time. All interactions identified in the two-hybrid system were confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation. Our results indicate that in our conditions, CRY1, CRY2 and PER2 proteins interact with BMAL1 by binding to different sites of BMAL1, but that only PER2 interacts with CLOCK alone. Moreover, in keeping with the idea that the CRY proteins are more potent inhibitors than PER2, we found that CRY1 and CRY2 both modify the interaction between PER2 and BMAL1, but not vice versa.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec><title>Interaction of PER2, CRY1 and CRY2 with BMAL1</title><p>We first sought to identify the interactions between each of the repressors with BMAL1 using a mammalian two-hybrid system.

In this system, an interaction of the two clock components reconstitutes a functional transcription factor that will activate a luciferase reporter under the control of a GAL4-based promoter. For GAL4-BMAL1/PER2-VP16, a 1000-fold increase in luciferase activity was observed (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). Similar values were obtained for GAL4-BMAL1/CRY1-VP16 and GAL4-BMAL1/CRY2-VP16 (750- and 950-fold, respectively; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). However, only a minimal activation of the reporter was seen when GAL4-BMAL1 was expressed alone or together with an unrelated fusion protein (PAX5-VP16) or when the VP16 fusions were co-transfected with the Gal4 DBD alone (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A, C</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>PER2, CRY1 and CRY2 all interact with BMAL1</bold>.

Therefore, it appears likely that in this case the respective results depend strongly on the system and cell type used and that cell-specific factors might be involved in mediating the interaction. In the mammalian two-hybrid system we employed in HER911 cells, CRY1 and 2 do not interact with CLOCK.</p></sec><sec><title>CRY1 and CRY2 influence the interaction between PER2 and BMAL1</title><p>Since in our system, all three repressors bind to BMAL1, we wanted to know whether these proteins mutually influence each other's binding to BMAL1. We first analyzed the influence of CRY1 and 2 on the interaction between PER2 and BMAL1.

When we co-transfected <italic>Cry2</italic>, however, the increase in reporter activity was markedly higher and sustained over a much wider dose range (1&#x02013;100 ng), a decrease was observed only with the two highest amounts of co-transfected plasmid (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>, open triangles).</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>CRY1 and CRY2 have different effects on PER2-BMAL1 interaction</bold>.

We wished to find out whether this would still be true in the presence of CLOCK and repeated the co-transfections as described above, but additionally co-transfected <italic>Clock</italic>. We observed an overall higher reporter activity but were able to reproduce the differences between <italic>Cry1 </italic>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>, solid squares) and <italic>Cry2 </italic>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>, solid triangles).

Co-transfection of 1 ng-1 &#x003bc;g <italic>Cry1 </italic>expression plasmid led to a dose-dependent increase in PER2-VP16 expression whereas it did not influence GAL4-BMAL1 levels, co-transfection of <italic>Cry2 </italic>caused a slight increase in both PER2-VP16 and GAL4-BMAL1 expression only with the highest amount tested (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). Additional co-transfection of <italic>Clock </italic>had no effect on GAL4-BMAL1 levels. PER2-VP16 expression levels were slightly elevated when <italic>Clock</italic>, but not <italic>Cry</italic>, was co-transfected whereas no further increase was seen with <italic>Clock </italic>in the presence of <italic>Cry </italic>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>).</p><p>A crucial role of CRY proteins in the nuclear entry of PER1/2 has been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. It has also been described that CRY expression has an effect on BMAL1 localization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Since in the mammalian two-hybrid system used in this study only fusion proteins that are present in the nucleus can activate the transcription of the reporter, we determined the subcellular localization of GAL4-BMAL1 and PER2-VP16. To this end, we performed Western blots on nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions of HER911 cells transfected as described above (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3D</xref>). The effects of <italic>Cry1/2 </italic>and <italic>Clock </italic>basically followed the pattern observed in total extracts for both fractions, we did not detect any gross redistributions of the fusion proteins. If anything, the influence was stronger in the cytoplasm, which would not influence mammalian two-hybrid results.</p><p>In summary, fusion protein expression levels do not correlate with the degree of reporter activation, since e.g. the highest amount of <italic>Cry1 </italic>leads to a marked increase in PER2-VP16 expression and nonetheless significantly decreases luciferase activity. We therefore conclude that the modulations of luciferase activity we observe in the mammalian two-hybrid system reflect true modulations of PER2-BMAL1 interaction by the respective co-expressed proteins. In this scenario, CLOCK would strengthen the interaction because the increase in luciferase activity caused by co-transfection of <italic>Clock </italic>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>) is markedly higher than the slight increase in PER2-VP16 expression. A similar effect has in fact been observed by Kiyohara <italic>et al</italic>. for the interaction of CRY1 with the heterodimer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Given that in our system, PER2 interacts with both BMAL1 and CLOCK (and those two in turn with each other), a stabilization of PER2-BMAL1 interactions by CLOCK might be envisaged through the formation of a heterotrimer where each component interacts with the other two. The increase in PER2-VP16 expression after co-transfection of <italic>Cry1 </italic>is very likely due to a stabilization of PER2-VP16 by CRY1, an effect that has been reported before [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><p>CRY1 appears to be more effective than CRY2 in disrupting PER2-BMAL1 interactions. The observed decrease in luciferase activity is not due to less PER2-VP16 or GAL4-BMAL1 available, on the contrary, there is clearly elevated PER2-VP16 expression. For <italic>Cry2</italic>, a less pronounced increase in expression is observed, especially with low amounts of co-transfected <italic>Cry2</italic>, which, however, already cause a marked increase in reporter activation. Of course, these effects might be cell-specific; however, they fit in with previous observations. Recently, CRY1 has been proposed as the main repressor of BMAL1-CLOCK-mediated transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], and previous studies in mice also show that the <italic>Cry1 </italic>gene has a dominant role over <italic>Cry2</italic>, because one normal <italic>Cry1 </italic>allele sustains normal circadian rhythms in behavior, while one <italic>Cry2 </italic>allele leads to arrhythmicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Since the PER proteins have been reported to be weaker repressors than CRY1/2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], the ability of CRY1 (and, to a lesser extent, CRY2) to disrupt PER2-BMAL1 interactions might be important to allow stronger repression of the transcription activation potential of the heterodimer.</p></sec><sec><title>PER2 does not significantly affect the interaction between CRY and BMAL1</title><p>If the CRY proteins, especially CRY1, act as the main repressors, PER2 should not be able to destabilize the interactions between the CRY proteins and BMAL1. Preliminary experiments showed that co-transfection of small amounts of <italic>Per2 </italic>indeed did not reduce CRY1/2-BMAL1-mediated luciferase activation in the mammalian two-hybrid system (data not shown). To further test this hypothesis, we co-transfected <italic>Cry1/2-VP16 </italic>together with <italic>Gal4-Bmal1 </italic>and an excess of <italic>Per2</italic>. Since the DNA amount that can be transfected is limited, we decreased the amounts of co-transfected <italic>Cry1/2-VP16 </italic>rather than increased that of <italic>Per2</italic>. For <italic>Cry1 </italic>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>) as well as for <italic>Cry2 </italic>(Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>) we found a dose-dependent reduction in luciferase activity as co-transfected plasmid amount decreased, both in the presence (solid circles) and the absence (open circles) of PER2. Co-transfection of <italic>Per2 </italic>actually increased luciferase activity instead of diminishing it, which might hint at a stabilization of CRY-BMAL1 interactions by PER2. Alternatively, it could be due to increased protein expression or nuclear availability of the fusion proteins; we were, however, not able to determine expression levels of the fusion proteins in this experimental set-up.

The results of Kiyohara <italic>et al</italic>.

No significant increase was observed for <italic>Cry2-VP16</italic>. We therefore conclude that CRY1 is still able to weakly interact with this truncated version of BMAL1, whereas CRY2 binding is completely abolished (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>Mapping of PER2, CRY1 and CRY2 binding sites in BMAL1</bold>.

PER2 consequently still appears to be able to bind to this BMAL1-mutant, although to a much lesser extent than to GAL4-BMAL1&#x00394;C-term, which indicates that the PAS domain of BMAL1 might be involved in PER2 binding. It also seems to play a role in CRY1 binding since the residual reporter transactivation observed with GAL4-BMAL1&#x00394;C-term and CRY1-VP16 disappears when the deletion in <italic>Bmal1 </italic>is extended to the PAS B domain.</p><p>GAL4-BMAL1&#x00394;HLH/PAS A was able to activate the luciferase reporter to a considerable extent already in the absence of any VP16 fusion protein.

Although it is difficult to draw any conclusions due to the high background activity of this <italic>Bmal</italic>1 mutant, these results confirm the observations made using the other two truncated forms, namely that the N-terminal portion of BMAL1 appears to be most important for PER2 binding, less crucial for the binding of CRY1 and not essential for interactions with CRY2.</p><p>In summary, our interaction data leads to a model where PER2 binds to the N-terminus of BMAL1, where the PAS A domain is located. Since PER2 itself also contains a PAS domain, a direct interaction between these two domains could be envisaged. CRY1 would bind more towards the PAS B domain and CRY2 even further C-terminally. This hypothesis is in line with observations of Kiyohara <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] who report normal binding of PER2, but not of CRY1, to a C-terminally truncated version of BMAL1. Others have also identified mutations in the C-terminus of BMAL1 that weaken BMAL1-CRY1 interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. To our knowledge, the binding site for CRY2 has not been mapped in BMAL1 so far. However, given that CRY2 was less effective than CRY1 in disrupting PER2-BMAL1 interactions in our system, it can be expected to be further away than the binding site for CRY1, which, in our model, would actually be the case.</p><p>CBP and p300, transcriptional co-activators found to interact with BMAL1, have also been hypothesized to bind to the extreme C-terminus that harbors a putative transcription activation domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Thus, the fact that CRY1 and CRY2 bind more C-terminally to BMAL1 than PER2 might also explain why they have a stronger capacity to inhibit BMAL1-CLOCK-mediated transcriptional activation.</p></sec><sec><title>Confirmation of the interactions in cos-7 cells</title><p>We were not able to confirm the interactions identified in the mammalian two-hybrid system by co-immunoprecipitation of <italic>in vitro </italic>transcribed/translated proteins (data not shown).

We show that PER2 binds to both BMAL1 and CLOCK whereas in our system, CRY1 and CRY2 are only able to bind to BMAL1. These interactions can be observed in transfected cells also in the absence of endogenous clock proteins, but not <italic>in vitro</italic>, indicating that post-translational modifications of the interaction partners and/or not clock-related bridging proteins are necessary to stabilize them. Analysis of deletion mutants of BMAL1 reveals that PER2 interacts with N-terminal regions, in contrast to CRY1 and CRY2 that both need C-terminal motifs to be able to bind to BMAL1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). The CRY proteins moreover seem to have a higher affinity to BMAL1 than PER2. Taken together, our results provide new insights into the interactions between activating and repressing components of the circadian clock. They also confirm the notion that the CRY proteins are more potent inhibitors of BMAL1-CLOCK mediated transcriptional activation than the PER proteins, which might be due both to their higher affinity to BMAL1 and their binding to the C-terminus of BMAL1.</p><fig position="float" id="F8"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p><bold>Model of PER2, CRY1 and CRY2 binding to BMAL1</bold>.
