The PI3K-Akt pathway is a similarly conserved signalling pathway which regulates processes such as differentiation, proliferation and survival. Mice with disrupted Notch and PI3K signalling show phenotypic similarities during haematopoietic cell development, suggesting functional interaction between these pathways.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We show that cellular responsiveness to Notch signals depends on the activity of the PI3K-Akt pathway in cells as diverse as CHO cells, primary T-cells and hippocampal neurons. Induction of the endogenous PI3K-Akt pathway in CHO cells (by the insulin pathway), in T-cells (via TCR activation) or in neurons (via TrKB activation) potentiates Notch-dependent responses. We propose that the PI3K-Akt pathway exerts its influence on Notch primarily via inhibition of GSK3-beta, a kinase known to phosphorylate and regulate Notch signals.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The PI3K-Akt pathway acts as a "gain control" for Notch signal responses. Since physiological levels of intracellular Notch are often low, coincidence with PI3K-activation may be crucial for induction of Notch-dependent responses.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The phosphoinositide-3-kinases (PI3Ks) constitute an enzyme family of p85/p110 heterodimers responsible for regulating numerous biological processes in diverse cell types [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] such as cellular proliferation, differentiation and survival. Of particular interest is the role of this pathway in lymphocyte activation, where antigen and cytokine receptor ligation result in activation of PI3K-driven signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. A key target of PI3K activity is Akt/PKB, which mediates many of the effects of PI3K activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>PI3K is activated in T-cells both in response to T-cell receptor (TCR) stimulation, and by engagement of the co-stimulatory receptor CD28. Gene targeting studies have emphasised the essential role PI3K plays in these responses: whereas PI3K-deficient mice are immunodeficient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], constitutive activity is associated with hyperproliferative T-cell responses and autoimmunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Equally, preventing the termination of PI3K activity by conditional gene targeting of the lipid phosphatase <italic>Pten </italic>in T-cells leads to autoimmunity and development of lymphoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. These studies demonstrate that PI3K activity is tightly regulated and plays an integral role in the maintenance of lymphocyte homeostasis.</p><p>The Notch signalling pathway plays a critical role in a wide range of developmental processes in the embryo, including binary lineage decisions and boundary formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Binding of the Notch ligands Delta or Jagged to the Notch receptor instigates proteolytic cleavage which releases the Notch intracellular domain (N-IC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] which activates the transcription factor CBF-1 which, in turn, controls target genes such as Hes-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Central to Notch's role is its ability to modulate the differentiative potential of pluripotent cells, for instance in the neural stem cell compartment. The effects of Notch also extend to the developing immune system, where it directs the differentiation of lymphoid precursors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Recent data have highlighted unexpected functions for the Notch pathway in regulating cells of the peripheral immune system. Co-incident delivery of Notch signals to T-cells exerts a profound effect upon the outcome of antigen-stimulation <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] suggesting that interplay between the antigen receptor and Notch pathways regulate the outcome of peripheral T-cell responses.</p><p>Mice expressing catalytically inactive PI3K subunit p110&#x003b4; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] or a deletion of p110&#x003b4; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] exhibit defective B-cell and T-cell receptor signalling: antigen-mediated activation of BCR or TCR fails to activate Akt and cells exhibit defective proliferation and cytokine responses. Recent publications have demonstrated that Notch signals modulate cytokine production by T-cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], suggesting that the Notch pathway integrates with TCR-mediated signals to modulate cytokine production. Furthermore, marginal zone B (MZB) cell development is severely impaired in both p110&#x003b4;- and Notch2-deficient mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Taken together with Notch's ability to modulate TCR signals, this phenotypic similarity suggested to us the possibility of Notch/PI3K signalling integration. Our studies reveal that the PI3K-Akt pathway is a potent inducer of Notch-dependent responses in cell types as diverse T-cells and neurons, demonstrating that this is a cell signalling paradigm with broad applicability.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Inhibition of the PI3K-Akt pathway impairs Notch signalling in Jurkat T-cells</title><p>To address whether the PI3K pathway is a regulator of Notch-responsiveness, we generated a Jurkat E6.1 T-cell line which stably expresses full-length human Notch2 cDNA (J-N2 cells). J-N2 cells were treated with plate-bound recombinant human Delta1 protein (hereafter referred to as Delta1-Fc) fusion protein, and Notch signalling was measured using a transiently-transfected CBF1-driven luciferase reporter construct (p10xCBF1-luc). Plate-bound recombinant Delta1-Fc efficiently transactivated CBF1-luc, driving around a 10-fold increase in activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). A similar result was obtained using the murine Hes-1 promoter cloned upstream of the luciferase reporter (data not shown). Strikingly, treatment of these cells with the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 led to a dose-dependent decrease in Delta1-Fc-induced Notch signalling (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). A similar result was observed with the mechanistically-distinct PI3K inhibitor Wortmannin (data not shown). The integrity of this reporter assay as an accurate reflection of Notch signalling was confirmed by assessing mRNA levels of the Notch target gene Hes-1 by Q-PCR in Delta1-Fc-treated J-N2 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). As with the CBF1-dependent reporter, treatment with LY294002 inhibited the up-regulation of Hes-1 by Delta1-Fc.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Inhibition of the PI3K-Akt pathway impairs Notch signalling in Jurkat T-cells</bold>. <bold>(A) </bold>J-N2 cells were transfected with 14 &#x003bc;g of p10xCBF1-luc and 1 &#x003bc;g pTK-RL, incubated overnight, then plated onto 96-well plates coated with either 20 &#x003bc;g/ml hIgG4 or 20 &#x003bc;g/ml hDelta1-Fc along with LY294002 for 6 hours.

To further define the mechanism by which PI3K activity regulates Notch signals, we asked whether the inhibitory effect of LY294002 could be recapitulated with an inhibitor of Akt.

Taken together, these data identify the PI3K-Akt pathway as being responsible for the high level of ligand-induced Notch activation in J-N2 cells.</p></sec><sec><title>The PI3K-Akt pathway regulates Notch-responsiveness in primary human CD4<sup>+ </sup>T-cells</title><p>We next investigated whether PI3K activity also regulates Notch-responsiveness in primary human CD4<sup>+ </sup>T-cells. We asked whether PI3K induction, triggered by TCR activation, could influence Hes-1 levels (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). In the absence of any exogenously added Delta 1 (open bars-IgG control), TCR activation (with anti-CD3/anti-CD28 antibodies) up-regulated Hes-1 levels in a LY294002-sensitive manner. Significantly, this induction was also blocked by the gamma secretase inhibitor DAPT, consistent with an absolute requirement for N-IC. We also studied the induction of Hes-1 by Delta 1-Fc treatment (closed bars). In the absence of TCR activation, Delta 1-Fc induced a small, but consistent induction of Hes-1. However, coincidence of Delta 1-Fc with TCR activation (anti-CD3/anti-CD28 antibodies) dramatically up-regulated Hes-1 levels in a LY294002-sensitive manner. Again, this induction was also blocked by the gamma secretase inhibitor DAPT. LY294002 also inhibited Notch signalling in primary human CD4<sup>+ </sup>T-cells transfected with p10xCBF1-luc and a Notch1 intracellular domain expression plasmid (data not shown), demonstrating that the effect of PI3K on Notch is exerted downstream of Notch cleavage. Thus, TCR activation dramatically increases the cellular response to Notch signals in primary human T cells via a mechanism requiring the PI3K-Akt pathway.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>The PI3K-Akt pathway regulates Notch-responsiveness in primary human CD4<sup>+ </sup>T-cells</bold>. <bold>(A) </bold>24-well tissue culture plates were coated with anti-human IgG4 and anti-mouse IgG2a capture antibodies at 1 &#x003bc;g/ml in PBS, and incubated at 4&#x000b0;C, overnight.

Over-expression of a constitutively-active Akt construct (gagAkt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]) was sufficient to potentiate the ability of pN1-IC to drive CBF1-dependent reporter activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>PI3K regulates Notch signals through GSK3&#x003b2; activity</title><p>Previous data has suggested that inactivation of GSK3&#x003b2; by the Wingless pathway enhanced Notch signals by preventing inhibitory phosphorylation of N-IC by GSK3&#x003b2; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Therefore, given that Akt phoshorylates and inactivates GSK3&#x003b2; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], we hypothesised that Akt-dependent inactivation of GSK3&#x003b2; might be responsible for Notch potentiation. To address this question, we looked at the N1-IC-induced Notch response in primary human CD4<sup>+ </sup>T-cells treated with the GSK3&#x003b2; inhibitor lithium chloride. Increasing concentrations of LiCl induced a dramatic increase in Notch signalling (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>Inhibiting GSK3&#x003b2; with lithium chloride enhances Notch signals in primary human CD4<sup>+</sup>, but not Jurkat, T-cells</bold>. <bold>(A) </bold>Primary human CD4<sup>+ </sup>T-cells were nucleofected with 4 &#x003bc;g p10xCBF-luc, 0.5 &#x003bc;g pTK-RL and 1 &#x003bc;g of either pN1-IC or pcDNA3.1 and plated o/n in triplicate with increasing concentrations of LiCl.

This fact, coupled with limited transfection efficiency of primary T cells, makes it technically difficult to achieve robust induction of a transfected CBF1 reporter construct by Delta1-Fc. However, given the large potentiation of Notch-responsiveness by LiCl (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>), we hypothesised that, in the presence of LiCl, robust Delta1-Fc dependent induction of a CBF1 reporter could be observed. We found that, consistent with the technical issues outline above, plate-bound Delta1-Fc activates the CBF1 reporter weakly and unreliably in the absence of LiCl (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). However, LiCl greatly potentiates activation of the reporter by plate-bound Delta1-Fc (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>). Thus, the GSK3&#x003b2; inhibitor LiCl is sufficient to potentiate primary Notch-responsiveness in primary human CD4<sup>+ </sup>T-cells, triggered either by N1-IC expression, or by ligation of endogenous full length Notch by plate-bound ligand.</p><p>In Jurkat T-cells, deficient in <italic>Pten </italic>expression, basal Akt activity is high [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], so we expected GSK3&#x003b2; to be maximally inhibited. Consistent with this, LiCl treatment did not exert any further effect on Delta1-induced signalling in Jurkat-N2 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>PI3K activity also regulates Notch responsiveness in CHO cells and neurons</title><p>To investigate whether PI3K-dependent regulation of Notch responsiveness may be a general phenomenon extending beyond T-cell biology, we took advantage of a Notch-dependent CHO cell reporter assay which we have previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. In this assay, CHO cells which stably express a human Notch2 receptor cDNA and a CBF1-dependent luciferase reporter construct (termed CHO-N2) are co-cultured with a second CHO cell line which stably expresses the full-length human Delta1 cDNA (termed CHO-hDelta1). CHO-hDelta1 cells trigger a dose-dependent luciferase response to the CHO-N2 cells, whilst control CHO parental cells fail to activate the Notch pathway (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4A</xref>). We next asked if activation of the PI3K pathway influenced Notch signals in this assay system. As predicted from our T-cell studies, including insulin in the culture medium potentiated Notch signalling, and this effect was blocked almost completely by inclusion of LY294002 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>). From our observations with T-cells, we hypothesisesd that GSK3&#x003b2; inhibition with LiCl could substitute for insulin in potentiating Notch signalling induced by CHO-hDelta1 cells. LiCl does indeed potentiate Notch signalling in the CHO co-culture system, leading to a substantial enhancement of ligand-dependent reporter activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4C</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p><bold>The PI3k/GSK3&#x003b2; pathway also regulates Notch signalling in CHO cells and in primary neurons</bold>. <bold>(A) </bold>CHO-N2 cells were co-cultured with increasing numbers of either CHO-hDelta1 or control CHO cells and luciferase reporter activity assayed for after 24 hours.

As observed with T-cells, inhibition of GSK3&#x003b2; with lithium chloride strongly enhanced the level of Notch signalling in rat primary hippocampal neurons in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>). PI3K-activating neurotrophins such as BDNF regulate cell survival, proliferation and differentiation of both peripheral and central neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].

Moreover, over-expression of constitutively active gagAkt was sufficient to potentiate pN1-IC-driven reporter activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E</xref>). To further reinforce this finding, expression of a constitutively-active GSK3&#x003b2; construct (S9A), which is resistant to inactivation by Akt, prevented BDNF induction of Notch responsiveness (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4E</xref>). In contrast, expression of wild-type GSK3&#x003b2;, which is inhibited by Akt activity, failed to significantly reduce reporter activity. As observed with T-cells, inhibition of GSK3&#x003b2; with lithium chloride strongly enhanced the level of Notch signalling in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4D</xref>). Thus the PI3K-Akt pathway positively regulates Notch signals via GSK3&#x003b2; in neurons as well as T-cells, as summarised in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>A schematic depicting a proposed mechanism for the influence of the PI3K pathway on Notch-responsiveness</bold>.

The cellular output must represent a net response to a diverse set of cues, and therefore the pathways mediating these responses are frequently integrated. Our studies demonstrate for the first time that PI3K activity strongly potentiates Notch responsiveness in diverse cell types. Given the vital nature of PI3K and Notch in controlling cellular survival and differentiation, the implications of this finding are far-reaching.</p><sec><title>Reciprocal signalling between the Notch and PI3K pathways in T cells</title><p>Ligation of lymphocyte antigen receptors leads to activation of PI3K, initiating a diverse and wide-ranging set of signalling pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Our findings that PI3K activation enhances Notch signalling leads us to suggest that Notch pathway activation might be an inherent consequence of lymphocyte activation. This positions the Notch pathway as a central mediator of antigen-dependent stimulation of immune cells.</p><p>T-cells are entirely quiescent in the absence of antigen signals, but are shifted rapidly into a state of activation following TCR ligation. Inappropriate control of this activation can lead to autoimmune disease, and therefore negative feedback loops are an inherent feature of T-cell biology. Recent data show that Notch signals block Akt activation in peripheral CD4+ T-cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Indeed we also observe that in primary human CD4+ T-cells recombinant Delta1-IgG4 fusion protein, or Notch-IC expression, blocks TCR-mediated phosphorylation of Akt and GSK3&#x003b2; (GM, BC, unpublished data). Although Akt activation is essential for production of cytokines such as IL2 and IFN&#x003b3; by T-cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], constitutive activity is associated with cellular transformation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], and therefore the existence of a negative feedback loop to limit antigen-dependent Akt activation would appear rational. We have shown that co-incident Notch signals are enhanced upon TCR activation, and we hypothesise that by inhibiting Akt activity, enhanced Notch signalling may constitute a negative feedback control impacting upon peripheral T-cell activation.</p><p>It is interesting to note that whilst the model we propose is consistent with the data generated in peripheral T-cells, a number of studies suggest that the opposite is true [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Ciofani et al demonstrate that during the earliest stages of T-cell development in the thymus Notch signals co-operate with pre-TCR signalling to <italic>activate </italic>Akt-dependent metabolism, thereby promoting expansion of those T-cells which have undergone favourable TCR rearrangement. The functional outcome of PI3K/Notch pathway interaction thus appears to reverse from developing to mature T-cells, an observation which further underlines the ability of the Notch pathway to perform multiple, context-dependent, tasks during development. We suggest that a molecular understanding of how Notch can function as a bi-directional regulator of Akt activity is a research priority.</p></sec><sec><title>PI3K and Wnt signalling modulate Notch responses via a common pathway</title><p>Our data strongly suggests that PI3K activity links to the Notch signalling pathway through Akt-mediated inactivation of GSK3&#x003b2;, a known downstream effector of Akt. In support of this data, PI3K and GSK3&#x003b2; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] have both been identified as binding partners for N-IC in immunoprecipitation studies. GSK3&#x003b2; has also previously been positioned as a component of the downstream Notch signalling pathway in lateral inhibition in Drosophila [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Furthermore, GSK3&#x003b2; activity is inhibited downstream of both the wingless and PI3K pathways, and thus represents a convergent site for integration of extracellular signals with the Notch pathway. Indeed, inhibiting GSK3&#x003b2; activity by activating the wingless pathway with Wnt-1 has been shown to enhance Notch-dependent reporter activity in NIH-3T3 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. We note, however, that although an interaction between GSK3&#x003b2; and Notch seems conclusively proven, the functional consequences of this interaction are not consistent between different studies. Whilst our data agrees with that of Espinosa et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], that is that GSK3&#x003b2; activity inhibits Notch signalling, data from the Nye laboratory in GSK3&#x003b2;-deficient murine embryonic fibroblasts demonstrates that GSK3&#x003b2; phosphorylates and stabilises Notch-IC, leading to enhanced signalling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Although we have no definitive explanation for these experimental differences, it is possible that, as discussed above for thymocytes and T-cells, the effect of GSK3b on Notch changes between embryonic and mature tissues.</p></sec><sec><title>Notch signalling in neural cells</title><p>Notch's role during embryonic development is not to directly program neuronal differentiation itself, but to inhibit this cell fate choice in neighbouring cells during the lateral inhibition process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. During neurogenesis, this is achieved by Notch target genes blocking transcription of pro-neural transcription factors such as MASH-1. Interestingly, conditional deletion of Pten in neural progenitors leads to dramatic alterations in brain architecture, an observation which the authors attribute to increased proliferation and self-renewal of neural stem cell populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. Given that the data presented here establishes the Notch-suppressing capability of Pten, deregulated renewal of progenitors in these mice may be in part due to enhanced Notch signalling. This hypothesis awaits testing.</p><p>Notch also plays an emerging role in differentiating neurons by inhibiting dendritic outgrowth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. It is tempting to speculate that Notch-dependent dendritic retraction, reliant on neuron-neuron interactions, is augmented by target-derived neurotrophic factors promoting PI3K signalling. In differentiated neurons, Notch contributes to synaptic plasticity, learning and memory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. The long-standing involvement of BDNF and other neurotrophins in synaptic plasticity raise the possibility that PI3K-Notch interplay is at work in this scenario as well.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our data demonstrates that the potentiation of Notch signalling by PI3K is conserved in ontologically-distinct cell types, leading us to suggest that it represents a general mechanism of signal integration linking two evolutionarily-conserved pathways together. This apparently simple observation has far-reaching implications regarding the mechanisms by which stem cell self-renewal and differentiation proceeds. It will be interesting to assess the relevance of this finding in other signalling contexts, such as tumour formation, where Notch and PI3K have important roles.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Materials and plasmids</title><p>SH-6, lithium chloride, LY294002, Wortmannin and BDNF were from Calbiochem.
