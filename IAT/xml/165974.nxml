We report here that human kin17, a nuclear stress-activated protein, associates with both chromatin and non-chromatin nuclear structures in a cell cycle- and DNA damage-dependent manner. After <sc>l</sc>-mimosine block and withdrawal we observed that kin17 protein was recruited in the nucleus during re-entry and progression through S phase. These results are consistent with a role of kin17 protein in DNA replication. About 50&#x00025; of the total amount of kin17 protein was detected on nuclear structures and could not be released by detergents. Furthermore, the amount of kin17 protein greatly increased in both G<sub>1</sub>&#x0002f;S and S phase-arrested cells in fractions containing proteins anchored to nuclear structures. The detection of kin17 protein showed for the first time its preferential assembly within non-chromatin nuclear structures in G<sub>1</sub>&#x0002f;S and S phase-arrested cells, while the association with these structures was found to be less stable in the G<sub>2</sub>&#x0002f;M phase, as judged by fractionation of human cells and immunostaining. In asynchronous growing cells, kin17 protein interacted with both chromatin DNA and non-chromatin nuclear structures, while in S phase-arrested cells it interacted mostly with non-chromatin nuclear structures, as judged by DNase I treatment and <italic>in vivo</italic> UV cross-linking. In the presence of DNA damage in S phase cells, the distribution of kin17 protein became mainly associated with chromosomal DNA, as judged by limited formaldehyde cross-linking of living cells. The physical interaction of kin17 protein with components of the nuclear matrix was confirmed and visualized by indirect immunuofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy. Our results indicate that, during S phase, a fraction of the human kin17 protein preferentially associates with the nuclear matrix, a fundamentally non-chromatin higher order nuclear structure, and to chromatin DNA in the presence of DNA damage.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>DNA replication is a complex phenomenon and it is unclear how 3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>9</sup> bp of DNA per typical human cell are replicated with a high degree of fidelity in a relatively short time in a process that could involve thousands of origins of replication. Uncertainty still exists as to whether or not true origins of chromosomal DNA replication exist in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg459c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg459c2">2</xref>). Given this complexity, it is likely that nucleic acid metabolism is carried out on spatially organized domain structures in the cell nucleus. Evidence suggests that the nuclear matrix, a non-chromatin nuclear structure is a key player in organizing higher order chromatin&#x0002f;nuclear structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg459c3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg459c5">5</xref>). In the case of DNA replication, fluorescence microscopic analyses revealed discrete granular sites of replication, i.e. replication sites or replication foci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg459c6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg459c8">8</xref>). Nascent DNA and several proteins involved in DNA synthesis have been found to attach to these non-chromatin nuclear structures, thereby forming replication foci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg459c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg459c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg459c9">9</xref>). In addition, non-chromatin nuclear elements have also been implicated in the initiation step of DNA replication and putative origins of replication are often situated close to matrix attachment regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg459c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg459c11">11</xref>).</p><p>The kin17 protein was initially identified based on the cross-reacting property of antibodies raised against the stress-activated <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> RecA protein. The kin17 protein displays common epitopes with the RecA protein and shares 47&#x00025; homology over a 40 residue stretch in the RecA C-terminal region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg459c12">12</xref>). In RecA protein, this region is involved in the regulation of DNA binding and in the SOS response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg459c13">13</xref>). Human kin17 is a 45 kDa nuclear protein which is remarkably conserved during evolution, ubiquitously expressed in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg459c14">14</xref>) and forms intranuclear foci in proliferating cells. To date, major features of the kin17 protein are its ability to: (i) bind to curved DNA found at the hot-spots of illegitimate recombination of human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg459c15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg459c16">16</xref>); (ii) complement the functions of the bacterial transcriptional factor H-NS, which binds to curved DNA and controls gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg459c17">17</xref>); (iii) be up-regulated after UV and ionizing radiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg459c18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg459c23">23</xref>). We have reported that a fraction of kin17 protein is strongly and directly associated with chromosomal DNA in human cells. The amount of kin17 protein anchored to nuclear structures increases 2.6-fold after &#x003b3;-irradiation and was found to be concentrated in large nuclear foci associated with replication protein A (RPA). Furthermore, clones expressing a human <italic>KIN17</italic> antisense transcript elicited major disruptions in S phase progression as well as a significant decrease in clonogenic cell growth and proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg459c22">22</xref>). There is a relationship between kin17 protein, DNA replication and DNA damage, since these antisense clones displayed a 6-fold increase in their radiosensitivity in comparison with controls, suggesting an impaired tolerance to DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg459c24">24</xref>). Blattner <italic>et al</italic>. have also highlighted a link between the presence of UV-induced DNA damage and the mouse <italic>KIN17</italic> pathway in deficient Xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group A (XPA) mouse cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg459c20">20</xref>). Further more, the integrity of human global genome repair is crucial for the up-regulation of the human <italic>KIN17</italic> gene. In particular, the presence of functional XPA and Xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group C (XPC) proteins is a prerequisite for the up-regulation of human <italic>KIN17</italic> gene expression after UV-C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg459c23">23</xref>). Interestingly, XPA, XPC and RPA proteins have been implicated in DNA damage recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg459c25">25</xref>). Recently, we have reported a physical interaction between human kin17 protein and SV40 large T antigen. This interaction inhibited <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> DNA synthesis, suggesting a role of the kin17 protein in DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg459c26">26</xref>). Taken together, these observations suggest that kin17 protein is a nuclear maintenance protein involved in DNA replication and in the cellular response to DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg459c20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg459c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg459c26">26</xref>).</p><p>The determination of the distribution of proteins implicated in DNA replication among subcellular fractions and their interactions with nuclear structures will cast light on how replication is initiated and otherwise regulated. Elucidation of the precise subnuclear compartmentalization of kin17 protein and its dynamic relocalization in human cells should help to uncover roles of this protein in chromosomal DNA replication. The aim of the present cell fractionation and immunostaining study was then to determine if the detergent-resistant nuclear kin17 protein could be associated with the nuclear matrix. We demonstrated for the first time that, in addition to its increased association with chromosomal DNA after DNA damage, kin17 protein is also detected in the nuclear matrix in all the phases of the cell cycle, becoming strongly associated with non-chromatin nuclear structures during S phase.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cell culture and synchronization</title><p>Human cervical carcinoma HeLa and human colorectal carcinoma RKO and HCT116 cell lines were grown in Dulbecco&#x02019;s modified Eagle&#x02019;s medium (DMEM) with 10&#x00025; fetal calf serum and synchronized in early S phase with 0.5&#x02013; 3 mM hydroxyurea (Sigma) or 15 &#x000b5;M aphidicolin (Sigma) treatment for 16&#x02013;18 h, in G<sub>1</sub>&#x0002f;S with 50&#x02013;400 &#x000b5;M <sc>l</sc>-mimosine (Sigma) treatment for 16&#x02013;18 h or in G<sub>2</sub>&#x0002f;M phase with 0.2 &#x000b5;M nocodazole (Sigma) treatment for 16&#x02013;18 h.

This increase was maintained throughout the cell cycle (lanes 4&#x02013;7). As control experiments, we detected p34<sup>cdc2</sup> and cyclin B proteins in the same immunoblot. The p34<sup>cdc2</sup>&#x0002f;cyclin B complex is required for the G<sub>2</sub> to M transition and these proteins are synthesized during late S and G<sub>2</sub> phases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg459c36">36</xref>). We found these proteins to be increased 6&#x02013;9 h after drug withdrawal (lanes 5 and 6), corresponding to cells in late S and G<sub>2</sub> phase. The recruitment of kin17 protein during re-initiation of DNA replication suggests a physiological role of this protein in this process.</p></sec><sec><title>Increased association of human kin17 protein with nuclear structures in G<sub>1</sub>&#x0002f;S and S phase-arrested cells</title><p>Since kin17 protein is recruited in synchronized cells released in S phase, we sought to determine whether kin17 protein remained bound to the sites of stalled replication forks. We then examined kin17 protein sublocalization in asynchronous and hydroxyurea- and <sc>l</sc>-mimosine-treated HeLa cells. Hydroxyurea and <sc>l</sc>-mimosine are agents known to block the elongation of DNA replication by reducing the dNTP pool. Hydroxyurea or <sc>l</sc>-mimosine treatment resulted in a population of cells predominantly stalled at the G<sub>1</sub>&#x0002f;S border, as determined by flow cytometry of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) pulse-labeled cells (data not shown).</p><p>We have suggested that kin17 protein participates in a cellular response to irradiation, thus helping to overcome the perturbation of DNA replication produced by unrepaired DNA lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg459c22">22</xref>). Since in RKO cells &#x0223c;50&#x00025; of kin17 protein is extracted with 1&#x00025; non-ionic detergent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg459c22">22</xref>), we asked whether the <sc>l</sc>-mimosine and hydroxyurea treatments leading to a G<sub>1</sub>&#x0002f;S and early S phase arrest, respectively, may change this distribution. Under the same experimental conditions, asynchronous and arrested RKO or HCT116 cells were lysed in buffer N to discriminate between &#x02018;cytoplasmic and soluble nuclear proteins&#x02019; (detergent-extractable fraction) and &#x02018;proteins anchored to nuclear structures&#x02019; (nuclei-bound fraction) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg459f2">2</xref>). Proteins extracted from each fraction were immunoblotted with anti-kin17 protein, anti-RPA or anti-PCNA antibodies and the relative amounts quantified. In asynchronous HCT116 cells, 30&#x02013;50&#x00025; of the kin17 protein, RPA or PCNA remained bound to nuclei, compared to only 10&#x02013;20&#x00025; in RKO cells, the remainder being present as a detergent-extractable form (compare lanes 1 and 10 from both detergent-extractable fraction and nuclei-bound fraction). In the nuclei-bound fraction of HCT116 cells, the maximal levels of kin17 protein were, respectively, 4- and 6-fold higher than in mock-treated cells after both <sc>l</sc>-mimosine and hydroxyurea treatments (the signals in lanes 5 and 9 over that in lane 1 in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg459f2">2</xref>). In RKO cells, the highest levels were, respectively, 2.5- and 3-fold (lanes 13 and 17 over lane 10 in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg459f2">2</xref>). A similar pattern was observed for RPA70 levels except for <sc>l</sc>-mimosine-treated RKO cells (lanes 11&#x02013;14), whereas PCNA levels increased slightly in hydroxyurea-treated RKO cells (lanes 15&#x02013;18). However, treatment of HCT116 and RKO cells with the lowest concentration of hydroxyurea used (0.5 mM, lanes 6 and 15) increased the level of detergent-resistant kin17 protein, PCNA and RPA70 to their maximum compared to mock-treated cells (lanes 1 and 10). In contrast, only minor modifications in kin17 protein or PCNA levels were noted in the detergent-extractable fractions of RKO cells after <sc>l</sc>-mimosine (lanes 11&#x02013;14) or hydroxyurea (lanes 15&#x02013;18) treatment compared to mock-treated cells (lane 10), whereas a modest 1.5- to 2-fold increase was noted in HCT116 cells after treatment (the signals in lanes 5 and 9 over lane 1). Interestingly, the increased RPA levels present in the nuclei-bound fractions of both cell lines were found to be linked to decreased levels of this protein in the corresponding detergent-extractable fractions. Similar results to hydroxyurea were obtained in cells arrested in S phase by aphidicolin treatment (data not shown). It is important to notice that <sc>l</sc>-mimosine, aphidicolin and hydroxyurea treatments stall DNA replication, induce DNA single-strand breaks and sister chromatid exchange and may cause oxidative cell stress. The possibility that the alterations of kin17 protein distribution by these chemicals may reflect a response to generic cell stress cannot be excluded. Nevertheless, <sc>l</sc>-mimosine treatment, which induces a cell cycle arrest in late G<sub>1</sub> phase close to the G<sub>1</sub>&#x0002f;S border in HeLa cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg459f1">1</xref>), has little effect on the level of kin17 protein. Although the whole content of kin17 protein was increased in S phase-arrested cells (by hydroxyurea), we constantly observed an increased association of this protein with nuclei-bound fractions in S phase cells (after <sc>l</sc>-mimosine withdrawal). It could then indicate that the main effect of these drugs observed on kin17 protein was not due to a response to generic cell stress.</p></sec><sec><title>RPA and kin17 proteins interact with both chromatin DNA and nuclear protein complexes</title><p>The increased association of kin17 protein with nuclear structures suggests that, in addition to DNA binding, a portion of kin17 protein could also interact with protein components organized into foci on non-chromatin structures. To test this hypothesis, we investigated the localization of kin17 protein in asynchronous HeLa cells using a fractionation method that includes a mild detergent extraction to produce extracted nuclear pellets, which were further extensively digested by DNase I to obtain solubilized supernatants and nuclear pellets resistant to nuclease. These fractions were immunoblotted with anti-kin17 protein, anti-RPA or anti-PCNA antibodies (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg459f3">3</xref>A). In asynchronous HeLa cells, &#x0223c;40&#x00025; of the total kin17 protein was present as a Triton X-100-extractable form, and the remainder was bound to nuclei (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg459f3">3</xref>A, lanes 1 and 2). About 70&#x00025; of the total PCNA was found in the detergent-extractable fraction, while &#x0223c;90&#x00025; of the total RPA was sensitive to mild detergent extraction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg459f3">3</xref>A, lanes 1 and 2), as already described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg459c37">37</xref>). Therefore, kin17 protein was strongly associated with nuclei compared to RPA and PCNA, two other nuclear proteins implicated in DNA transactions that are more easily solubilized by mild detergent extraction. To investigate whether the kin17 protein present in the detergent-resistant fraction was linked to chromatin or non-chromatin nuclear structures, the extracted nuclei were digested with DNase I (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg459f3">3</xref>A). This drastic treatment (1000 U&#x0002f;ml DNase I at 25&#x000b0;C for 30 min) stripped &#x0223c;90&#x00025; of core histones (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg459f5">5</xref>B) and DNA (unpublished data). It is important to note that incubation at 25&#x000b0;C for 30 min of detergent-extracted nuclei without DNase I treatment revealed that &#x0223c;60&#x02013;70&#x00025; of the nucleus-bound kin17 protein, &#x0223c;90&#x00025; of nucleus-bound RPA and &#x0223c;50&#x00025; of nucleus-bound PCNA were released into the supernatant (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg459f3">3</xref>A, lane 3 versus 4). Interestingly, DNase I digestion did not help to release further kin17 protein from the nuclear fraction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg459f3">3</xref>A, lane 6), as compared to samples processed under the same conditions but without nuclease digestion (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg459f3">3</xref>A, lane 4), whereas bound RPA and bound PCNA were almost completely released into the supernatant (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg459f3">3</xref>A, lane 5). For all three proteins, neither detectable proteolytic products nor a remarkable reduction in the total amount were found after incubation at 25&#x000b0;C for 30 min. This temperature-induced release has already been described for PCNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg459c38">38</xref>). Addition of ATP to the reaction mixture did not prevent the heat-induced dissociation of kin17, RPA or PCNA proteins bound to extracted nuclei (data not shown). Furthermore, the core histones were detected only in the nuclear pellet fractions, indicating that DNA was not solubilized at the incubation temperature (data not shown). We conclude that a fraction of kin17 protein interacts with non-chromatin nuclear structures, such as the nuclear matrix, while RPA and PCNA are mostly associated with nuclear structures sensitive to DNase I digestion.</p><p>To confirm the association of kin17 protein with non-chromatin nuclear structures, we prepared replication foci attached to the nuclear matrix in detergent-permeabilized HeLa cells after <italic>in situ</italic> DNase I digestion followed by ammonium sulfate extraction to eliminate loosely bound proteins and the digested DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg459c33">33</xref>). After paraformaldehyde fixation, indirect immunofluorescence staining was performed with monoclonal anti-kin17 antibodies (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg459f3">3</xref>B). Although the focal nuclear staining of kin17 protein was maintained, DNase I digestion and ammonium sulfate extraction slightly affect the structure of the nuclear foci. The foci seem fewer and fatter, suggesting that DNase I and ammonium sulfate treatment may induce the collapse of numerous small foci into each other. Furthermore, the intensity of kin17 protein detection was clearly increased in S phase-arrested cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg459f3">3</xref>B, panels c and d) compared to asynchronous cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg459f3">3</xref>B, panel b). These nuclear foci, which are still able to synthesize DNA <italic>in vitro</italic> (data not shown), remained associated with nuclear matrix structures despite the removal of &#x0003e;80&#x00025; of the total nuclear DNA, as evidenced by DAPI staining of permeabilized cells before (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg459f3">3</xref>B, panel e) and after chromatin extraction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg459f3">3</xref>B, panels f&#x02013;h). Taken together, these results indicate that a fraction of kin17 protein is anchored to the nuclear matrix, a structure which is, as already described, well preserved during the isolation procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg459c7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg459c33">33</xref>).</p><p>The data described above, i.e. (i) the resistance to extensive nuclease treatment of bound kin17 proteins present in the detergent-extracted nuclei and (ii) the preservation of the staining pattern of kin17 protein in nuclear foci after <italic>in situ</italic> chromatin digestion, suggest that most of the nuclear fraction of kin17 protein (detergent-unextractable) is associated with non-chromatin nuclear structures. To check this hypothesis, we performed cross-linking experiments on living HeLa cells with increasing doses of UV (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg459f3">3</xref>C and D). In this type of experiment only proteins that are directly associated with DNA may be cross-linked by UV and become high molecular weight complexes that cannot be extracted and detected by SDS&#x02013;PAGE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg459c39">39</xref>). The eventual association of kin17 protein with chromatin DNA <italic>in vivo</italic> will lead to a decreased amount of this protein in the fractions obtained after detergent and high salt extraction. Alternatively, if kin17 protein is bound to nuclear proteins by non-covalent interactions, it will be solubilized by detergent and salt extraction.</p><p>After irradiation with increasing UV doses, cells were subjected to <italic>in situ</italic> extractions with 0.1&#x00025; Triton X-100 followed by 1 M NaCl. Only the soluble forms of kin17 protein from asynchronous (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg459f3">3</xref>C) and early S phase cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg459f3">3</xref>D) were detected by immunoblotting. In asynchronous cells, the amount of kin17 protein decreased with UV irradiation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg459f3">3</xref>C, lane 10), indicating that kin17 protein bound to nuclei after detergent extraction became unextractable upon UV irradiation. Interestingly, the kin17 protein present in the Triton-extractable fraction (cytoplasmic and nucleoplasmic proteins) seemed to be more efficiently cross-linked than the the Triton-unextractable nuclei-bound fraction. The UV dose required to make half of the kin17 protein covalently link to DNA was calculated to be between 100 and 200 mJ&#x0002f;cm<sup>2</sup> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg459f3">3</xref>C, lanes 4 and 5). The situation was completely different in hydroxyurea-treated cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg459f3">3</xref>D). Indeed, the nearly constant amounts of kin17 protein detected after both Triton extraction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg459f3">3</xref>D, lanes 1&#x02013;5) and high salt extraction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg459f3">3</xref>D, lanes 6&#x02013;10) indicated that this protein was not cross-linked to DNA in this UV range since salt extraction released almost all the kin17 protein. The RPA70 present in the Triton-extractable fraction showed a more efficient cross-linking to DNA in early S phase cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg459f3">3</xref>D, lanes 1&#x02013;5) than in asynchronous cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg459f3">3</xref>C, lanes 1&#x02013;5). RPA70 was scarcely cross-linked to DNA in the same UV range (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg459f3">3</xref>C and D, lanes 6&#x02013;10). Although the <italic>KIN17</italic> gene is induced by UV, it should be noted that <italic>KIN17</italic> mRNA starts to accumulate at 8 h after UVC irradiation and that the doses of UV used in the protein&#x02013;DNA cross-linking experiments presented here were 50- to 250-fold higher than the UV dose used in stress response studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg459c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg459c23">23</xref>). From the UV cross-linking experiments, we suggest that, in early S phase cells, the nuclei-bound fraction (detergent-unextractable) of kin17 protein was predominantly linked to non-chromatin nuclear structures, such as the nuclear matrix, or with matrix-associated proteins and a small proportion bound directly to DNA, while RPA70 associated preferentially with chromatin DNA.</p></sec><sec><title>Relocalization of kin17 protein to chromatin after DNA damage in S phase HeLa cells</title><p>The results presented above show that <italic>in vivo</italic> only a part of kin17 protein is directly associated with chromosomal DNA in human cells, whereas the remainder is bound to non-chromatin structures. The amount of kin17 protein anchored to nuclear structures increased 2.6-fold after &#x003b3;-irradiation and was found to be concentrated into large nuclear foci associated with RPA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg459c22">22</xref>). These observations indicate that kin17 protein could be a nuclear maintenance protein involved in DNA replication and in the cellular response to DNA damage. We asked whether part of such a response involves changes in the subnuclear localization of the kin17 protein following other types of DNA damage. S phase synchronized HeLa cells were subjected to MNNG treatment before <italic>in vivo</italic> formaldehyde cross-linking. Next, protein&#x02013;protein complexes (reflecting the fraction not associated with the chromatin) were separated from DNA&#x02013;protein complexes (representing the proteins bound to chromatin) by density gradient fractionation as described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg459c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg459c27">27</xref>). Purified complexes were de-cross-linked by boiling in SDS sample buffer and analyzed for their protein components by SDS&#x02013;PAGE. Immunoblot analysis of these fractions showed that kin17 protein in untreated cells was equally distributed in the unbound (free protein) versus bound fractions (data not shown). However, after DNA damage induced by 100 &#x000b5;M MNNG for 3 h (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg459f4">4</xref>A) or 200 &#x000b5;M MNNG for 30 min (data not shown) a 5-fold increase in chromatin-bound kin17 protein was observed (compare lane 1 to 2), while the unbound fractions (free protein) remained unchanged (data not shown). As a control experiment, the fractions were probed with anti-histone H1 antibodies (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg459f4">4</xref>B). The same level of chromatin-bound histone H1 was detected in untreated and MNNG-treated cells. These results indicate that the up-regulation of kin17 protein observed after DNA damage formation leads to an increased association of this protein with chromatin DNA.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>In vivo</italic> association of kin17 protein with non-chromatin nuclear structures in HeLa cells using protein&#x02013;protein cross-linking</title><p>To investigate further the association of kin17 protein with non-chromatin nuclear structures, we cross-linked HeLa cells <italic>in vivo</italic> using a method described by Fujita <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg459c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg459c38">38</xref>). Living cells are first cross-linked with the cell-permeable protein&#x02013;protein (but not DNA&#x02013;protein) cross-linker DSP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg459c29">29</xref>) and then chromatin is extensively stripped by nuclease and salt treatments thus allowing exploration of the organization of nuclear proteins. If kin17 protein is associated with non-chromatin nuclear structures <italic>in vivo</italic>, they could be covalently cross-linked to these structures and, consequently, the bound protein would become resistant to chromatin stripping. If they bind to particular chromatin components but not to the structures, then they would be extracted together with chromatin.</p><p>We first performed cross-linking experiments and subsequent chromatin extraction with increasing DSP concentrations and detected kin17 protein by immunoblot in the fractions obtained (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg459f5">5</xref>A). In asynchronous HeLa cells, &#x0223c;40&#x00025; of kin17 protein was present in the fraction extracted with 0.1&#x00025; Triton X-100 and the remainder was bound to nuclei (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg459f3">3</xref>A, lanes 1 and 2, and Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg459f5">5</xref>A, lanes 1 and 2). This ratio remained unchanged when cells were treated with DSP even at the highest concentration tested (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg459f5">5</xref>A). The constant distribution observed between extracted and remaining amounts of kin17 protein indicate that the treatment does not generate non-specific protein aggregation leading to artificial insolubility. Therefore, we used a DSP concentration of 200 &#x000b5;g&#x0002f;ml in the following experiments in agreement with a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg459c30">30</xref>).</p><p>In asynchronous cells, almost all of the Triton-insoluble kin17 protein and RPA were readily extracted with the buffer containing 0.5 M NaCl (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg459f5">5</xref>A, lane 4 versus 3, and Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg459f6">6</xref>A, lane 3 versus 2). In contrast, in asynchronous DSP cross-linked cells the Triton X-100-insoluble kin17 protein became resistant to salt extraction and reached &#x0223c;80&#x00025; (&#x0223c;50&#x00025; of total kin17 protein) at the highest concentration of DSP used, indicating that kin17 protein was covalently linked to other salt-insoluble nuclear protein(s) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg459f5">5</xref>A, lane 8).</p><p>We asked further whether kin17 protein was linked to chromatin or to non-chromatin nuclear structures. After Triton and salt extraction, the DSP cross-linked nuclei were digested with DNase I followed by a second 0.5 M NaCl extraction. This treatment stripped &#x0223c;90&#x00025; of core histones (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg459f5">5</xref>B, lane 7 versus 8) and DNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg459f6">6</xref>D, panels a and b versus c and d). Detergent-unextracted forms of both RPA and kin17 proteins were detected mostly in the resultant nuclear pellets (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg459f6">6</xref>B, lane 5). In parallel, HeLa cells grown on coverslips were cross-linked with DSP and extracted with Triton X-100 and NaCl as described above but analyzed by immunocytochemistry. The observed nuclear staining revealed the characteristic dot distribution of kin17 protein in cells directly fixed with formaldehyde (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg459f6">6</xref>D, panel a), after extraction with Triton X-100 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg459f6">6</xref>D, panel b) as well as after cross-linking with DSP (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg459f6">6</xref>D, panel c). Only a slight residual fluorescence was detected in cells stripped without cross-linking (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg459f6">6</xref>D, panel d), indicating that even after a drastic extraction, a small fraction of kin17 protein still remains tightly bound to the nucleus. We conclude that under physiological conditions in asynchronous cells, kin17 protein is completely extracted after nuclease digestion and salt extraction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg459f6">6</xref>A, lane 5), whereas in S phase-arrested cells this fraction became strongly bound to other nuclear proteins (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg459f6">6</xref>A, lane 10).

To check whether kin17 protein was still associated with non-chromatin nuclear structure in S phase, we analyzed hydroxyurea-treated HeLa cells arrested in early S phase with and without <italic>in vivo</italic> cross-linking with DSP. Without cross-linking, kin17 protein was completely extracted by salt treatment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg459f6">6</xref>A, lane 3), but in early S phase cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg459f6">6</xref>A, HU) we detected a fraction of kin17 protein that became resistant to salt extraction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg459f6">6</xref>A, lane 8) and to DNase I digestion (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg459f6">6</xref>A, lane 10). The major part of RPA in S phase was unextracted by detergent (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg459f6">6</xref>A, lane 6) and became resistant to 0.5 M NaCl (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg459f6">6</xref>A, lane 8) and nuclease extraction (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg459f6">6</xref>A, lane 10). Taken together, the data shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg459f6">6</xref>A and B indicate that both kin17 protein and RPA were associated with non-chromatin nuclear structures in S phase. Immunofluorescence staining after fractionation showed that the cross-linked kin17 proteins are indeed in the nuclei of S phase HeLa cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg459f6">6</xref>D, panel g), as they are in cells directly fixed with formaldehyde (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg459f6">6</xref>D, panel e) or after extraction with Triton X-100 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg459f6">6</xref>D, panel f).

We prepared residual structures corresponding to the nuclear matrix obtained by detergent, nuclease and salt extractions of living HeLa cells as described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg459c34">34</xref>). The protocol was applied to cells attached to plastic dishes, allowing preservation of the ultrastructure and more efficient extractions. By using this method, we obtained 100&#x00025; completely preserved nuclear matrix, as revealed by electron microscopic observations. The nuclear matrix thus prepared contained less than 5&#x00025; protected residual DNA (unpublished data). The successive extractions clearly reveal the three components of the nuclear matrix: the peripheral lamina (L), the internal or interchromatin matrix &#x0005b;with interchromatin granules (Ig) resistant to the treatment&#x0005d; and the residual nucleolus (NU) (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg459f7">7</xref>A and C). The detection of kin17 protein with monoclonal antibodies revealed both scattered (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg459f7">7</xref>A) and typical focal labeling restricted to the internal matrix (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg459f7">7</xref>B&#x02013;D). Considering the drastic treatment used to prepare nuclear matrix of living cells attached to plastic culture dishes (1&#x00025; Triton X-100, extensive DNase I digestion and 2 M NaCl), few gold particles could be detected. Isolated gold particles were visualized on the fibers of the internal nuclear matrix but very rarely on interchromatin granules (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg459f7">7</xref>A). It should be noted that foci of kin17 protein were preserved in 11&#x00025; of the nuclear matrix observed, mostly close to the residual lamina (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg459f7">7</xref>A&#x02013;C), while the residual nucleoli were never labeled. The immunogold electron microscopy localization of kin17 protein demonstrated its association with the nuclear matrix.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The human kin17 protein is mainly localized in the nucleus of asynchronous cells. Several genotoxic agents trigger the nuclear accumulation of this protein, indicating its participation in a general cellular response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg459c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg459c20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg459c23">23</xref>). These reports have suggested the participation of kin17 protein in DNA metabolism, although its precise biological activity remains to be determined.</p><p>We show here that kin17 protein is present in two different forms in HeLa cells: a fraction containing nearly 40&#x00025; of the total kin17 protein that is extractable by non-ionic detergent and a fraction tightly associated with the nucleus containing 60&#x00025; of kin17 protein resistant to detergent, as judged by cell fractionation and immunocytochemical analysis. Under the same experimental conditions, RPA and PCNA are at least 70&#x02013;90&#x00025; extractable by mild detergent extraction. We have extended this type of analysis to drugs that arrest cells in different phases of the cell cycle. We showed that the levels of the nuclei-bound kin17 protein increased in S phase-arrested cells, suggesting that newly synthesized kin17 protein is in a nuclei-bound form. Furthermore, we show that in synchronized HeLa cells in G<sub>1</sub>&#x0002f;S phase the levels of total kin17 protein gradually increased during progression through S phase. Although the level of chromatin-bound kin17 protein fraction seems to be constant after G<sub>2</sub>&#x0002f;M arrest by nocodazole treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg459c22">22</xref>), we show here that the association of kin17 protein with nuclear structures became less stable during mitosis, when resetting of the next replication cycle occurs, suggesting another possible role of kin17 protein in facilitating cell division.</p><p>In asynchronous cells, the fraction of kin17 protein extracted under mild detergent conditions mainly represents the chromatin-bound fraction, as judged by UV cross-linking experiments reported here. Interestingly, in S phase-arrested HeLa cells kin17 protein is barely bound to chromatin, suggesting a dynamic change in the association of this protein with other nuclear components during S phase. Nuclease treatment experiments further showed an interaction of kin17 protein with both nuclease-resistant nuclear structures and chromatin DNA, indicating that it does not associate simply with DNA. Our results also suggest that the detergent-extractable form of kin17 protein and&#x0002f;or the heat-sensitive portion of nuclear-bound kin17 protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg459f3">3</xref>A) represents the part of kin17 protein that is effectively linked to chromatin DNA. In addition to this resistance to nuclease, a characteristic feature of nuclear-bound kin17 protein is its dissociation by salt wash within a wide concentration range (0.2&#x02013;1 M NaCl), pointing to interactions with numerous partners and&#x0002f;or targets in nuclei (unpublished data). An association with nuclease-resistant nuclear structures using DNA as mediator may also be possible, but the data presented here are mostly in favor of an interaction with both chromatin DNA and one or more nuclease-resistant nuclear components.</p><p>We entertain the idea that the &#x02018;nucleoplasmic pool&#x02019; of kin17 protein (extracted by mild detergent) could serve as a reservoir of kin17 protein that may later be associated with both chromatin and&#x0002f;or nuclear matrix during DNA replication. Indeed, during S phase kin17 protein interacts predominantly with non-chromatin nuclear structures where it could form a transient complex involved in DNA replication. Alternatively, the equilibrium of kin17 protein between the &#x02018;nucleoplasmic pool&#x02019; versus the nuclei-bound form of kin17 protein (chromatin-bound plus non-chromatin-bound) would be required after generation of double-strand breaks induced by genotoxic agents like ionizing radiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg459c22">22</xref>). The simplest hypothesis would be that the nuclear accumulation of kin17 protein leads to an increase in the chromatin-bound fraction in order to facilitate the DNA replication process in spite of the presence of multiple damaged sites or other DNA lesions. This idea is reinforced by the data presented here showing that the methylating agent MNNG increases the amount of both kin17 protein and PCNA bound to chromatin DNA (data not shown for PCNA). Furthermore, it has been shown that PCNA interacts with other components of the high molecular weight replication complex and at the same time with chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg459c27">27</xref>). We hypothesize that after DNA lesion formation the complex containing kin17 and other proteins such as PCNA undergoes a dynamic rearrangement leading to the interaction of these proteins in or around DNA damage. Our results indicate that kin17 protein is one of several factors that equilibrate between the free nuclear pool and assembly into large structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg459c40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg459c41">41</xref>), further confirming the notion that the nucleus is a highly dynamic organelle in which the assembly of compartments in response to metabolic requirements of the cell may be a general feature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg459c41">41</xref>).</p><p>Nuclear morphology is strikingly deformed after the ectopic expression of kin17 protein in human cells, leading to the inhibition of DNA synthesis and to a drastic drop in clonogenic growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg459c42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg459c43">43</xref>). Furthermore, the inhibition of <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> DNA replication triggers by a direct interaction between human kin17 protein and SV40 large T antigen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg459c26">26</xref>), together with the results presented here, point to a role of kin17 protein in the regulation of DNA replication. DNA replication takes place in specialized compartments, such as the nuclear matrix, in which specific factors assemble in highly organized structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg459c4">4</xref>). The nuclear matrix is a non-chromatin substructure of the nucleus upon which chromatin is organized, DNA and RNA are processed and differential gene expression may be managed. The nuclear matrix is experimentally seen after removal of the nucleoplasm and chromatin by detergent extraction, nuclease digestion and high salt extraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg459c33">33</xref>). Proteins that remain within the nuclear structure after these treatments are defined as being &#x02018;nuclear matrix associated&#x02019;. However, some proteins may coagulate under high salt conditions and thereby be artificially detected as matrix elements. Alternatively, some proteins associated with the matrix <italic>in vivo</italic> may be stripped by salt extraction. Furthermore, exposure of cells to non-physiological buffers alters the native nuclear architecture and could also result in non-specific aggregation of matrix-related proteins. These limitations were circumvented by using the <italic>in vivo</italic> cross-linking method with the permeable chemical protein&#x02013;protein (but not DNA&#x02013;protein) cross-linker DSP, as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg459c30">30</xref>). We demonstrated that kin17 protein covalently linked to the nuclear structures became resistant to chromatin stripping and then associated with these non-chromatin nuclear structures <italic>in vivo</italic> during all the phases of the cell cycle.</p><p>The average amount of kin17 protein in several proliferating human cell lines is &#x0223c;2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup>&#x02013;1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>5</sup> molecules&#x0002f;cell nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg459c26">26</xref>). This amount of kin17 protein is similar to that of other nuclear proteins involved in DNA metabolism, such as RPA, AP endonuclease 1 (APE1), DNA ligase 1 and DNA polymerase &#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg459c37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg459c44">44</xref>). Several of these nuclear proteins localize either partly or completely in distinct &#x02018;bodies&#x02019; or subnuclear compartments that produce a punctate staining pattern when analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence. Immunocytochemical analyses detect kin17 as a protein mainly localized in nuclei with a staining pattern that resembles those of other proteins involved in DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg459c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg459c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg459c42">42</xref>). The observed intranuclear foci are substructures arising as a consequence of activities such as DNA replication and may reflect the assembly of dedicated &#x02018;factories&#x02019; at specific sites in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg459c45">45</xref>). Evidence for multiprotein DNA replication complexes has been accumulating in recent years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg459c27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg459c46">46</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg459c49">49</xref>). Recently, a model of DNA replication was proposed to represent the multiprotein DNA replication complex termed the &#x02018;DNA synthesome&#x02019;. The synthesome &#x02018;core&#x02019; comprised proteins involved in the elongation phase of DNA replication (DNA polymerases &#x003b1; and &#x003b4;, primase, replication factor C, DNA helicase, ligase I and topoisomerase II), whereas the proteins involved in the initiation phase of DNA replication (PCNA, RPA and topoisomerase I) are more loosely associated with it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg459c47">47</xref>). We have recently co-purified from HeLa cells the endogenous kin17 protein as a component of a high molecular weight protein complex with components of the &#x02018;DNA synthesome&#x02019; such as PCNA, RPA, DNA polymerase and ATPase activities (manuscript in preparation). The implication of kin17 protein in DNA replication is reinforced by the results presented here together with recent findings, i.e. (i) the inhibition of <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> DNA synthesis by a physical interaction between human kin17 protein and SV40 large T antigen, (ii) the increased expression of kin17 protein in cells entering S phase, (iii) the blockage in early-to-mid S phase of cells expressing a <italic>KIN17</italic> antisense transcript, (iv) the preferential association of kin17 protein with the nuclear matrix in S phase and (v) the co-purification of kin17 protein with the DNA synthesome. The molecular characterization of this matrix-associated protein and the determination of its biological activity will help to shed some light on replication regulation and on the role of the nuclear matrix in the activity of kin17 protein.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkg459f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> kin17 protein levels increased during the re-initiation of DNA synthesis and the progression into S phase.
