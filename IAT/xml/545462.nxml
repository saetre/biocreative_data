In an effort to identify novel proteins that might be involved in stabilizing stalled replication forks, <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> mutant <italic>wss1</italic>&#x00394; was isolated from a high-throughput screening of &#x0223c;5000 deletion strains for genes involved in the response to continuous, low-intensity UV irradiation.

WSS1 was also found to interact genetically with <italic>SGS1</italic>, <italic>TOP3</italic>, <italic>SRS2</italic> and <italic>CTF4</italic>, which are involved in recombination, repair of replication forks and the establishment of sister chromatid cohesion. A yeast two-hybrid screen identified a potential physical interaction between Wss1 and both Psy2 and Tof1.

Tof1 is known to be involved in stabilizing stalled replication forks and our data suggest that Wss1 and Psy2 similarly function to stabilize or process stalled or collapsed replication forks.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>DNA is a labile molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh994c1">1</xref>), and it is thus essential that a cell rapidly recognize DNA damage, coordinate cell cycle progression, and efficiently restore DNA to its native state. The cellular response to DNA damage has been particularly well characterized in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> through the isolation of mutants that are hypersensitive to specific DNA damaging agents. From these studies, three groups of functionally related genes have been identified and are referred to as the RAD3, RAD6 and RAD52 epistasis groups. The RAD3 and RAD6 genes encode proteins that function in nucleotide excision repair (NER) and post-replication repair (PRR), respectively. The RAD52 genes encode proteins involved in homology-dependent recombination and double-strand break (DSB) repair.</p><p>In addition to facilitating DSB repair, the RAD52 group genes are involved in repairing stalled or collapsed replication forks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh994c2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh994c5">5</xref>). These pathways are based on homologous recombination and require Rad52 to recruit Rad51 to sites of DSBs or collapsed replication forks. Rad51, the <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> analog of the bacterial recombination mediator RecA, forms single-stranded DNA&#x02013;protein filaments, which facilitate the formation of recombination intermediates by catalyzing strand invasion of the 3&#x02032;-overhang into a homologous duplex. Sgs1, a member of the RecQ family of helicases, forms a complex with Top3 (Sgs1&#x0002f;Top3), and is thought to process Rad51-recombination intermediates to produce non-crossover recombination products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh994c6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh994c8">8</xref>). Sgs1 is also thought to convert recombination intermediates into forms that are required to stabilize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh994c9">9</xref>) and restart stalled replication forks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh994c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh994c11">11</xref>), and to bind Mec1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh994c9">9</xref>). Consistent with these activities, Sgs1&#x0002f;Top3 is required for Rad53 activation when cells are damaged in the absence of Rad24, possibly by acting in a pathway that overlaps with Rad9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh994c12">12</xref>). In addition, Sgs1 binds Rad53 <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> and these proteins colocalize in S-phase specific nuclear foci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh994c12">12</xref>).</p><p>In addition to Sgs1, <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> has another helicase involved in resolving recombination intermediates, Srs2. Mutations in <italic>SRS2</italic> have been found to suppress the sensitivity associated with mutation of <italic>RAD6</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh994c13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh994c15">15</xref>), suggesting that Srs2 acts to funnel intermediates from recombinational repair to PRR. Interestingly, suppression of the sensitivity observed in <italic>rad6</italic>&#x00394; mutants is dependent on the presence of Rad52 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh994c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh994c16">16</xref>). In addition, Srs2 has been shown to efficiently displace Rad51 from DNA <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh994c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh994c18">18</xref>). Thus, it has been proposed that Srs2 acts as an anti-recombinase by catalyzing the removal of Rad51 from recombination intermediates and causing their disassembly, which allows for repair by other means (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh994c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh994c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh994c18">18</xref>).</p><p>In addition to these direct repair pathways, cells have evolved mechanisms to stabilize replication forks when they stall, due to the presence of damage or the absence of necessary substrates, such that replication may be restarted when cellular conditions return to normal. Two key proteins in this regard are Mrc1 and Tof1 (and the Tof1 binding partner Csm3), which are thought to be components of the processive replication fork where they help to prevent the uncoupling of the replication proteins from the associated DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh994c19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh994c21">21</xref>). The <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> analog of Tof1, Swi1, is also thought to stabilize collapsed replication forks in a conformation recognized by Mrc1 and checkpoint sensor proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh994c22">22</xref>). Once activated, the checkpoint system halts cell cycle progression, inhibits the firing of late origins of replication and induces a transcriptional response that facilitates survival.</p><p>Mrc1, Tof1 and Csm3 also appear to play an important role in establishing cohesion between sister chromatids by helping to recruit an alternate RFC complex (the Ctf18&#x02013;RFC complex) to stalled replication forks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh994c23">23</xref>). The Ctf18&#x02013;RFC complex can then load PCNA or an alternative clamp loader (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh994c24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh994c28">28</xref>), which facilitates loading of polymerase &#x003ba; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh994c25">25</xref>). The result is the establishment of cohesion between sister chromatids as they emerge from the modified replication fork. Important links between replication and cohesion are mediated by Ctf4 and Ctf8, which are thought to act in association with replication forks and are also required for robust sister chromatid cohesion. Ctf8 is a component of the Ctf18&#x02013;RFC complex and Ctf4 binds polymerase &#x003b1; and is thought to participate in repair of lagging strand synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh994c29">29</xref>). Neither <italic>CTF4</italic> nor <italic>CTF8</italic> is essential, unless <italic>MRC1</italic>, <italic>TOF1</italic> or other genes that facilitate the establishment or maintenance of cohesion are absent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh994c29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh994c32">32</xref>). In addition, the <italic>ctf4</italic>&#x00394; <italic>rad52</italic>&#x00394; double mutant exhibits severe growth defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh994c33">33</xref>). These results suggest that sister chromatid cohesion is important for the stabilization and recombinational repair of stalled replication forks. One possibility is that these proteins play a role in establishing cohesion between sister chromatids as they emerge from the replication fork, and in the absence of such juxtaposed sister chromatids, homologs are inappropriately used during recombinational repair if the fork stalls.</p><p>Here, we report the identification and initial characterization of <italic>WSS1</italic>, a gene that when deleted, renders cells sensitive to UVB (310 nm) and UVC (254 nm) irradiation, and results in severe genetic phenotypes when deleted in recombination, cohesion and cell cycle checkpoint deficient backgrounds. We also report the characterization of <italic>PSY2</italic> and <italic>TOF1</italic>, which encode proteins identified by a yeast two-hybrid screen for Wss1 interactors. <italic>PSY2</italic> and <italic>TOF1</italic> were found to display significant genetic interactions with each other, with several of the same genes identified for <italic>WSS1</italic>, as well as with <italic>WSS1</italic> itself. The data are consistent with a model wherein Wss1, Tof1 and Psy2, function to stabilize or process stalled replication forks.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>Yeast strains used in this study are listed in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh994tb1">1</xref>.

UVB irradiations were performed using a UVP-UVXX bench lamp with two 302 nm midrange bulbs (UVP Inc., Upland, CA) filtered by a 2 mm glass pane to yield an overall intensity of 1.04 Js<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>, a dose that results in little delay of doubling time (&#x0003c;1%) in wild-type cells. UVC irradiations were performed using a G8T5 germicidal tube (Ushio America, Cypress, CA). UV fluences were determined using a UVX radiometer with UVX-25 and &#x02212;31 sensors (Ultraviolet Products). Methyl methane sulfonate (MMS, Aldrich), 5-fluoro-orotic acid (5-FOA, RPI), hydroxyurea (HU, US Biological) and X-gal (Amersham) were also used in this study.

In each case, the ORF was amplified along with a &#x0223c;500 bp upstream of the start codon. PCR-amplified products were digested with XhoI&#x0002f;SacII and ligated into the low copy, centromeric plasmid pRS416 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh994c37">37</xref>).

To examine the G<sub>1</sub>&#x0002f;S checkpoint, cells were arrested in G<sub>1</sub> with &#x003b1;-factor (6 mg&#x0002f;ml) for 150 min. Cell were treated with 0.25% MMS during the final 30 min of the arrest and then released. Control cells were arrested but not exposed to MMS. Samples were removed every 15 min, fixed with formaldehyde and examined microscopically. To analyze cell cycle delay at the G<sub>2</sub>&#x0002f;M transition, log phase cultures were arrested with nocodazole (15 mg&#x0002f;ml) for 150 min. During the final 30 min of the arrest, cells were treated with 0.25% MMS and then released from both MMS and nocodazole. Aliquots were removed every 15 min, fixed with paraformaldehyde and resuspended in buffer (100 mM KPO<sub>4</sub> and 1.2 M sorbitol). Nuclei were counterstained with 4&#x02032;,6&#x02032;-diamidino-2-phenylindole and cells were visualized with a Nikon E600 microscope.

Aliquots of 2 ml were removed at 10 min intervals and fixed in 70% ethanol overnight at 4&#x000b0;C. Samples were then treated with 0.5 ml RNase [2 mg&#x0002f;ml RNase A (Sigma), 50 mM Tris, pH 8.0] for 2&#x02013;4 h, 0.2 ml pepsin [5 mg&#x0002f;ml pepsin (Sigma), 4.5 mg&#x0002f;ml concentrated HCl in H<sub>2</sub>O] for 30 min, and resuspended in 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5. For analysis, cells were diluted into 1 ml of SYTOX Green solution [1 mM SYTOX (Molecular Probes) in 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5] and sonicated. Samples were analyzed by flow cytometry using a FACScalibur (Becton Dickinson Immunocytometry Systems), with an argon laser tuned to 488 nm. The FL1 detector with a standard 530&#x0002f;30 band pass filter was used in the acquisition of SYTOX Green fluorescence.</p></sec><sec><title>Rad53 phosphorylation assay</title><p>Two aliquots of 1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>8</sup> log phase cells were collected and resuspended in 10 ml of YPAD with or without 0.2% MMS.

Whole cell extracts were prepared as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh994c41">41</xref>), separated on 6.5% SDS&#x02013;PAGE gels and transferred onto PVDF. Immunostaining was performed with a goat polyclonal antiserum to Rad53 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) used at a final dilution of 1:1000 followed by overnight incubation. Horseradish peroxidase-linked secondary anti-goat antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.) was used at a final dilution of 1:5000 with a 60 min incubation period.

The 5&#x02032; PCR primer contained a BamHI restriction site and a linker sequence encoding Gly-Gly-Ser-Gly-Gly. The 3&#x02032; PCR primer contained an XhoI restriction site. The PCR product was digested and ligated into BamHI&#x0002f;XhoI digested pEG202. Screening was done in yeast strain EGY48, using the reporter plasmid pSH18-34 and a genomic library (&#x0223c;2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> fragments) in pJG4-5 obtained from R. Brent (Molecular Sciences Institute, Berkeley, CA). Proper activation of the <italic>LEU2</italic> and <italic>lacZ</italic> reporter genes (located in EGY48 and pSH18-34, respectively) were used to identify clones with productive binding interactions.

All additional double mutants were constructed by transformation of a PCR generated DNA deletion cassette specific for <italic>WSS1</italic>, <italic>PSY2</italic> or <italic>TOF1</italic>.

Gene disruption was confirmed by colony PCR. Epistasis analyses of the double mutants were conducted using colony survival assays by comparing the UV or MMS sensitivity of the various double mutants with those of the corresponding single mutants. In these assays, cultures were grown to mid-log phase, diluted to &#x0223c;6 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> cells&#x0002f;ml and serially diluted in 5-fold increments. For UV assays, appropriate dilutions were plated, irradiated, grown for 2 days in the dark and counted. Cell cultures were prepared identically for MMS experiments and spread on agar media with the indicated concentration of MMS. Cells were grown for 3 days and counted. Several independent spores or transformants were analyzed for each double mutant to rule out anomalous phenotypes. The predicted additive interaction viability curves (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh994f2">2</xref>A, C&#x02013;F) were calculated by multiplying the sensitivity of one single mutant relative to wild type (viability of mutant&#x0002f;viability of wild type) by the measured viability of the other single mutant.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Identification of <italic>WSS1</italic></title><p>In a competitive fitness assay, a pool of logarithmically growing homozygous diploid deletion strains was subjected to continuous UVB irradiation. A control pool was grown in parallel without UVB exposure. During the experiment, pools were sampled every 8 h, genomic DNA was extracted from the cells, tags corresponding to individual deletion strains were PCR amplified (using conserved flanking sequences) and hybridization intensities from oligonucleotide arrays were collected. The hybridization data were used to calculate the relative growth rate for each deletion mutant in the pool. Mutants judged to be sensitive exhibited growth rates that were at least 20% lower than wild type. Strains that did not exhibit at least two hybridized tag signals at the initial time point that were greater than five times the background signal were not considered for further analysis.</p><p>Eight putative UVB-sensitive strains were identified and tested individually to verify the hybridization data (<italic>mnn1</italic>&#x00394;, <italic>wss1</italic>&#x00394;, <italic>isc1</italic>&#x00394;, <italic>yor322c</italic>&#x00394;, <italic>yor235w</italic>&#x00394;, <italic>clb5</italic>&#x00394;, <italic>dpb3</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>ybr277c</italic>&#x00394;). Growth rates of the homozygous diploid deletion strains in rich liquid media with and without UVB treatment were compared with that of BY4743. One strain, <italic>wss1</italic>&#x00394;, was verified as phenotypically more sensitive than wild type to continuous low-dose UVB irradiation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh994f1">1</xref>A). The eight strains were also tested for sensitivity to acute UVC irradiation, as well as MMS. Deletion of <italic>WSS1</italic> resulted in sensitivity to UVC in diploid cells homozygous for the deletion, as well as in <italic>MAT</italic><bold>a</bold> haploid cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh994f1">1</xref>B and C). During this study it was reported that <italic>wss1</italic>&#x00394; was isolated in a high-throughput screen for acute UVC and UVB sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh994c45">45</xref>). The strain <italic>clb5&#x00394;</italic> was also found to be sensitive to UVC; however, given that this gene encodes a well-studied cyclin, it was not further characterized.</p><p>Verification that the increased sensitivity to UVC was caused by the deletion of <italic>WSS1</italic> and not an artifact of strain construction was accomplished by complementation with plasmid-borne <italic>WSS1</italic> and acute UVC irradiation. We did not investigate complementation of the UVB sensitivity, since selective media is incompatible with the growth assay. The region of the chromosome containing <italic>WSS1</italic> and an upstream region containing the endogenous promoter (&#x0223c;500 bp) were cloned into pRS416. The <italic>wss1</italic>&#x00394; (<italic>MAT</italic><bold>a</bold> haploid) cells transformed with the plasmid containing <italic>WSS1</italic> were less sensitive to UVC (as sensitive as the wild-type control) than the single mutant transformed with an empty vector (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh994f1">1</xref>D). We also examined the HU sensitivity of the <italic>WSS1</italic> deletion strain. HU is thought to induce replication fork stalling by depleting cellular levels of dNTPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh994c46">46</xref>). Deletion of <italic>WSS1</italic> resulted in cells that grew significantly more slowly in the presence of HU (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh994f1">1</xref>E). The UV and HU sensitivity associated with the deletion of <italic>WSS1</italic> implies that its protein product may be important when replication forks stall due to damage or insufficient dNTPs.</p><p>To determine if <italic>WSS1</italic> plays a role in the damage response that is related to one of the known epistasis groups, it was deleted in strains carrying <italic>rad18</italic>&#x00394; (PRR), <italic>rad14</italic>&#x00394; (NER) or <italic>rad52</italic>&#x00394; (recombination). The <italic>wss1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>rad18</italic>&#x00394; double mutant is additively more sensitive to UVC than either single mutant (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh994f2">2</xref>A), implying Wss1 does not function in PRR. The <italic>wss1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>rad14</italic>&#x00394; double mutant is only marginally more sensitive than either single mutant (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh994f2">2</xref>B). Given the difficulty in interpreting epistatic relationships when one deletion strain is very sensitive and the other is not, we conclude only that the double mutant is not synergistically more sensitive to UV damage. Based on these results and the additional genetic interactions reported in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh994tb3">3</xref>, and discussed below, we conclude that <italic>WSS1</italic> does not contribute to either PRR or NER. In contrast, the <italic>wss1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>rad52</italic>&#x00394; mutant displayed a synergistic increase in sensitivity to UVC irradiation, relative to the corresponding single mutants (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh994f2">2</xref>C). These data suggest that Wss1 and Rad52 play a role in different pathways that act on a common intermediate.</p></sec><sec><title>Further characterization of Wss1 in the DNA damage response</title><p>It was reported previously that <italic>wss1</italic>&#x00394; is synthetically lethal in an <italic>sgs1</italic>&#x00394; background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh994c47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh994c48">48</xref>). Based on this interaction, we examined the effect of <italic>TOP3</italic> deletion, since at least some aspects of Sgs1 functions are mediated by a complex of Sgs1 and Top3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh994c6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh994c7">7</xref>). A synthetic growth defect in the absence of damage as well as a synergistic increase in sensitivity to UVC was observed in the <italic>wss1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>top3</italic>&#x00394; double mutant, but the mutant was viable (data not shown). To investigate the possibility that suppressor mutations arose in the <italic>wss1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>top3</italic>&#x00394; strain, <italic>WSS1</italic> was deleted in strains W1588-4C and U1619-9D (the latter of which carries a <italic>top3</italic>&#x00394; mutation and a <italic>URA3</italic>-marked <italic>TOP3</italic> plasmid). In the <italic>top3</italic>&#x00394; strain, loss of the complementing plasmid due to counterselection in the presence of 5-FOA yielded colonies that were slow growing, yet viable (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh994f2">2</xref>G). However, counterselection in the <italic>wss1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>top3</italic>&#x00394; strain did not give rise to any viable colonies (even after 6 days of growth). Thus, we conclude that suppressor mutation(s) arose during construction of the double mutant strain by gene disruption in a <italic>top3</italic>&#x00394; background and that without the suppressor mutation(s), simultaneous deletion of <italic>WSS1</italic> and <italic>TOP3</italic> is lethal. This is consistent with the synthetic lethality reported for <italic>wss1</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>sgs1</italic>&#x00394;, and suggests that Wss1 and the Sgs1&#x0002f;Top3 complex may act in different pathways that process a common intermediate.</p><p>To define the function of <italic>WSS1</italic> further, a genetic interaction with <italic>SRS2</italic> was investigated. <italic>SRS2</italic> encodes helicase with functions that at least partially overlap with <italic>SGS1</italic> in processing recombination intermediates. The <italic>wss1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394; double mutant exhibited a mild synergistic sensitivity to UVC treatment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh994f2">2</xref>D). One interpretation of these data is that Srs2 acts to oppose inappropriate recombination, and that this function becomes more critical in the absence of Wss1. We favor this interpretation because it is also consistent with the hypothesis that Wss1 functions in a pathway that recognizes stalled replication forks that are otherwise recognized and processed by Rad52 and Sgs1&#x0002f;Top3.</p><p>In addition to their roles in recombination, Srs2, Sgs1 and Top3 are thought to play roles in the cell cycle checkpoint response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh994c9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh994c12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh994c49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh994c50">50</xref>). To determine if <italic>WSS1</italic> plays a role in the cell cycle checkpoint response, we examined <italic>wss1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>rad9</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>wss1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>rad24</italic>&#x00394; double mutants. In both cases, we observed a synergistic increase in sensitivity to UVC treatment (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh994f2">2</xref>E and F). To determine if Wss1 plays a direct role in the cell cycle response, we examined Rad53 phosphorylation in the presence and absence of either Rad9 and&#x0002f;or Wss1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh994f3">3</xref>A). Deletion of <italic>RAD9</italic> resulted in a significant reduction of the amount of phosphorylated Rad53 following MMS damage. In contrast, deletion of <italic>WSS1</italic>, either in the wild-type or <italic>rad9</italic>&#x00394; strain, had no effect. Thus, the genetic and biochemical data suggest that Wss1 does not play a direct role in the checkpoint response, but rather in its absence, Rad9 and Rad24-mediated cell cycle arrest becomes more critical.</p><p>We also examined the integrity of the G<sub>1</sub>-, S- and G<sub>2</sub>&#x0002f;M-phase damage checkpoints in cells lacking <italic>WSS1</italic>. Following MMS treatment during &#x003b1;-factor arrest, wild-type and <italic>wss1</italic>&#x00394; cells showed similar delays before progressing through the G<sub>1</sub>&#x0002f;S transition, as judged by budding morphology (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh994f3">3</xref>B). The S-phase DNA damage checkpoint was analyzed by monitoring the DNA content of cells after their release from G<sub>1</sub> block. When treated with MMS following release from &#x003b1;-factor arrest, <italic>wss1</italic>&#x00394; and wild-type cells showed virtually identical transitions through S phase (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh994f3">3</xref>C). The G<sub>2</sub>&#x0002f;M-phase checkpoint was examined by monitoring mitotic division following DNA damage (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh994f3">3</xref>D). When cell cultures were released from nocodazole arrest after MMS treatment, both wild-type and <italic>wss1</italic>&#x00394; cells entered mitosis at similar rates. Thus, in an otherwise wild-type cell, Wss1 does not appears to be required for the G<sub>1</sub>-, S- and G<sub>2</sub>&#x0002f;M-phase damage checkpoints following MMS treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Interaction of Wss1 with Psy2 and Tof1</title><p>A yeast two-hybrid screen was performed to identify other proteins that may physically interact with Wss1. The entire <italic>WSS1</italic> gene was cloned into the bait vector pEG202 and screened against a <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> genomic DNA library of &#x0223c;2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6</sup> fragments. About 140 colonies growing on selective media were isolated and screened to remove false positives. Library plasmids from the potential positive clones were recovered and sequenced. From 30 individual clones, 11 unique proteins were predicted to interact with Wss1 (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh994tb4">4</xref>).</p><p>The majority of the fragments (14 out of 30) identified encoded TyA, a gag protein for the Ty retrotransposon. The strains <italic>nob1</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>rpn3</italic>&#x00394; are inviable and were also not further characterized. As indicated in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkh994tb4">4</xref>, a single fragment was obtained for <italic>TOF1</italic> and for <italic>PSY2</italic>. To confirm these interactions, direct yeast two-hybrid analyses were performed with the <italic>WSS1</italic> bait plasmid and the recovered <italic>TOF1</italic> and <italic>PSY2</italic> library plasmids. In each case, a strong binding interaction was verified using the <italic>LEU2</italic> reporter gene (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh994f4">4</xref>B). A productive interaction for Psy2 was also verified using the <italic>lacZ</italic> reporter (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh994f4">4</xref>C). Expression of the Tof1 fragment resulted in a slight autoactivation of <italic>lacZ</italic>; however, the signal intensity was significantly greater in the presence of Wss1-LexA fusion, also confirming the interaction (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh994f4">4</xref>C). However, initial attempts to immunoprecipitate the corresponding complexes with myc13-tagged Wss1, GST-tagged Tof1 and GST-tagged Psy2 failed. This implies that the physical interactions may depend on the protein concentrations or the cellular environment associated with the two-hybrid experiment, or at least that the complex is not stable under the conditions required for its immunoprecipitation. Nonetheless, the genetic data described below, implies that there is a functional interaction between Wss1, Psy2 and Tof1.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis of <italic>tof1</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>psy2</italic>&#x00394;</title><p>The <italic>tof1</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>psy2</italic>&#x00394; strains are both sensitive to MMS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh994c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh994c36">36</xref>). However, since <italic>psy2</italic>&#x00394; has not been previously characterized, its sensitivity was first confirmed by complementation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh994f5">5</xref>A). Double mutants of <italic>tof1</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>psy2</italic>&#x00394; were then constructed with <italic>wss1</italic>&#x00394;, <italic>rad52</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394;, as well as with each other. Analysis of MMS sensitivities demonstrated that <italic>tof1</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>psy2</italic>&#x00394; are synergistic with <italic>wss1</italic>&#x00394;, <italic>rad52</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394; (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh994f5">5</xref>B&#x02013;G). Additionally, the <italic>tof1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>psy2</italic>&#x00394; double mutant is synergistically more sensitive to MMS (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh994f5">5</xref>H). Sensitivity to UVC treatment also showed that <italic>wss1</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>tof1</italic>&#x00394; are synergistic; however, the interaction between <italic>psy2</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>wss1</italic>&#x00394; under these conditions could not be determined due to the insensitivity of <italic>psy2</italic>&#x00394; to UV irradiation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh994f5">5</xref>I and J). During the course of this work, a synthetic lethal interaction was reported for double mutant spore progeny of a heterozygous <italic>tof1&#x00394; srs2&#x00394;</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh994c48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh994c51">51</xref>). These genetic interactions suggest that Wss1, Psy2 and Tof1 have at least some functional overlap and they also suggest that the Wss1&#x02013;Tof1 and Wss1&#x02013;Psy2 interactions detected in the two-hybrid assay may be functionally significant.</p></sec><sec><title>Genetic interaction of <italic>WSS1</italic> with <italic>CTF4</italic></title><p>Ctf4 is thought to be associated with replication forks and to help establish sister chromatid cohesion after their replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh994c32">32</xref>). Because <italic>CTF4</italic> appears to play an essential but redundant function in establishing cohesion, synthetic interactions between <italic>ctf4</italic>&#x00394; and other gene mutations have been used to identify proteins involved in establishing or maintaining cohesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh994c29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh994c31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh994c32">32</xref>). Using this approach, it has already been suggested that Tof1 plays a role in establishing sister chromatid cohesion during replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh994c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh994c30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh994c31">31</xref>). To determine if Wss1 plays a similar role, we constructed a <italic>wss1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>ctf4</italic>&#x00394; double mutant and found that it was synergistically sensitive to UVC damage (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh994f5">5</xref>K). This result supports the hypothesis that Wss1 recognizes or processes stalled replication forks in a manner that has some functional redundancy with Ctf4.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>A critical component of the DNA damage response is the maintenance or stabilization of replication forks that have stalled in response to damaged DNA or depleted dNTPs, and must be eventually restarted. Mrc1, Tof1 and Csm3 have already been found to help build stable pausing complexes. These proteins are associated with the replication fork (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh994c23">23</xref>) and facilitate checkpoint activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh994c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh994c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh994c52">52</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh994c54">54</xref>) and the establishment of cohesion between sister chromatids, such that they are readily available for recombination repair of the stalled fork (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh994c23">23</xref>). While these proteins are thought to eventually recruit the Ctf18&#x02013;RFC-like complex and polymerse &#x003ba; to sites where the fork stalls, other proteins are likely to be required.</p><p>As part of an effort to identify additional proteins involved in the stabilization of stalled forks, we performed a genome-wide screen in <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> for genes whose deletion render yeast cells sensitive to low-intensity, chronic UVB radiation. The screen was performed under permissive conditions that allowed DNA synthesis in the presence of damaged DNA without causing cell cycle arrest or cell death. <italic>WSS1</italic> was isolated from this screen, and encodes a 30 kDa protein of unknown function. Wss1 shares 47% similarity and 28% identity to <italic>S.pombe</italic>, Spcc1442.07, which is thought to be a zinc protease, but Wss1 does not appear to contain the protein motifs commonly found in zinc proteases. Deletion of <italic>WSS1</italic> was found to render cells sensitive to chronic UVB, acute UVC irradiation and HU. During the course of these studies, <italic>wss1&#x00394;</italic> was also identified in a genome-wide screen for UV sensitive strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh994c45">45</xref>), and reported to be synthetically lethal with <italic>sgs1</italic>&#x00394;, based on a synthetic genetic array analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh994c47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh994c48">48</xref>). <italic>WSS1</italic> was originally identified in a screen for high copy suppressors of a temperature-sensitive mutant allele of <italic>SMT3</italic> (<italic>smt3-331</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh994c55">55</xref>), which encodes a ubiquitin-like protein (SUMO in higher eukaryotes) that is post-translationally conjugated to target proteins and is required for normal chromosome segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh994c55">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh994c56">56</xref>). The <italic>smt3-331</italic> mutants accumulate large-budded cells with sister chromatids separated by short spindles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh994c55">55</xref>). While <italic>WSS1</italic> was found to suppress the growth defects associated with <italic>smt3-331</italic> mutants, it did not suppress the large-budded phenotype, suggesting that it did not suppress the aberrant chromosome segregation.</p><p>We identified Tof1 and Psy2 as binding partners for Wss1 in a yeast two-hybrid screen. The physical interaction between Wss1 and Tof1 suggests that they may perform related functions. To examine the functional relatedness of Wss1, Tof1 and Psy2, we examined the damage sensitivity of the three double mutants, <italic>wss1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>tof1</italic>&#x00394;, <italic>wss1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>psy2</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>psy2</italic>&#x00394; <italic>tof1</italic>&#x00394;. All three were synergistically more sensitivite to MMS than the corresponding single mutants, implying that the three proteins play similar or overlapping roles and recognize a common substrate. This hypothesis is strengthened by the observation that <italic>TOF1</italic> deletion increases UV sensitivity only in a <italic>wss1</italic>&#x00394; background. Because Tof1 is known to function in the stabilization of stalled replication forks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh994c20">20</xref>), we suggest that both Wss1 and Psy2 also function to stabilize or process stalled or collapsed replication forks.</p><p>Proteins that stabilize replication forks, for example Mrc1 and Tof1, are often also involved in the checkpoint response to DNA damage, but Wss1 does not appear to play a direct role in cell-cycle wide checkpoint activation. While the <italic>wss1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>rad9</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>wss1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>rad24</italic>&#x00394; double mutants were synergistically sensitive to UV damage, relative to the single mutants, we found that Rad53 activation in response to MMS was not reduced by the deletion of <italic>WSS1</italic> either in a wild-type or <italic>rad9</italic>&#x00394; background. In addition, the G<sub>1</sub>-, S- and G<sub>2</sub>&#x0002f;M-phase damage checkpoints all remained intact following MMS treatment in the absence of Wss1. These results imply that in the absence of Wss1, cells show a greater reliance on checkpoint activation by Rad9 and Rad24.</p><p>Based on the idea that Wss1, Psy2 and Tof1 may stabilize or process stalled or collapsed replication forks, we examined the effect of crippling the recombination repair pathways by deleting <italic>RAD52</italic>. We found that the <italic>wss1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>rad52</italic>&#x00394; double mutant is significantly more sensitive to UV damage than predicted by the sensitivities of the two single mutants. We also found that <italic>TOF1</italic> and <italic>PSY2</italic> show similar genetic interactions with <italic>RAD52</italic> in response to MMS damage. Previously, <italic>wss1</italic>&#x00394; was shown to be synthetically lethal when combined with <italic>sgs1</italic>&#x00394;, and we have extended these results by showing that it is also synthetic lethal with <italic>top3</italic>&#x00394;. We interpret these data to mean that Wss1, Tof1 and Psy2 act at an early stage after forks stall and that in their absence, collapsed or broken forks result, which must be processed by Rad52 and Sgs1&#x0002f;Top3.</p><p>Similar to Sgs1, Srs2 also plays an important role in processing stalled replication forks. Srs2 destabilizes Rad51 filaments within recombination intermediates and thus acts as an anti-recombinase to help abort aberrant recombination intermediates to allow for repair by other means (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh994c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh994c18">18</xref>). For example, the synthetic lethality observed between <italic>mrc1</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394; was suggested to result from unrestrained recombination involving collapsed forks with unestablished cohesion between sister chromatids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh994c23">23</xref>). We find that <italic>wss1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394; is synergistically more sensitive to UV irradiation, relative to the <italic>wss1</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394; single mutants. Similarly, we observe synergistic increase in MMS sensitivity for <italic>tof1</italic>&#x00394; <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>psy2</italic>&#x00394; <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394;. Thus, we suggest that in the absence of Wss1, Psy2 or Tof1, Srs2 is required to restrain or control recombination.</p><p>The data are consistent with a model in which Wss1, Psy2 and Tof1 cooperate, perhaps along with Csm3 and Mrc1, to stabilize replication forks when they stall due to damaged DNA or insufficient dNTP levels. Given the different sensitivities of the corresponding deletion mutants (i.e. <italic>wss1</italic>&#x00394; is sensitive to UV- but not to MMS-mediated DNA damage, while <italic>tof1</italic>&#x00394; and <italic>psy2</italic>&#x00394; are sensitive only to MMS), these proteins may stabilize replication forks specifically in response to different forms of DNA damage. This is consistent with the damage response roles already proposed for Mrc1, Tof1 and Csm3. One model postulates that Mrc1, Tof1 and Csm3 recruit the Ctf18&#x02013;RFC-like complex to stalled replication forks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh994c23">23</xref>), which then loads PCNA or an alternative clamp loader (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh994c24">24</xref>). Polymerase &#x003ba; in turn replaces the RFC-like complex and ultimately establishes cohesion during replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh994c24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh994c28">28</xref>). It is presently not clear how Psy2 contributes to stable pausing complexes, but its potential interactions with Cdc6 and Rad53 suggest a cell cycle checkpoint role similar to that already proposed for Mrc1 and Tof1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh994c57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh994c58">58</xref>).</p><p>The precise role of Wss1 in stabilizing stalled replication forks is not yet clear. However, several lines of evidence point to a function intimately related to the establishment of sister chromatid cohesion and recombinational fork repair. First, we find that <italic>WSS1</italic> interacts genetically with <italic>CTF4</italic>, whose protein product is thought to couple DNA synthesis and sister chromatid cohesion. Second, our genetic data suggest that at least some functions of Wss1 overlap with those of Tof1, which is thought to help establish sister chromatid cohesion at stalled replication forks. Finally, overexpression of Wss1 suppresses the growth defect of <italic>SMT3</italic> mutants, apparently without suppressing the actual cohesion defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh994c55">55</xref>). One possibility that is consistent with the data is that Wss1 helps to funnel stalled forks into a pathway that is parallel to cohesion-mediated recombinational repair. This hypothesis is consistent with the increased importance of Rad52, Sgs1&#x0002f;Top3 and Ctf4 in the absence of Wss1, as well as with the ability of Wss1 overexpression to facilitate survival of strain with cohesion defects. The repair pathway favored by Wss1 might also be facilitated by the anti-recombinase activity of Srs2, explaining the increased dependence on Srs2 in the absence of Wss1.</p><p>We suggest that Wss1, Psy2 and Tof1, along with Mrc1 and Csm3, function to stabilize or repair stalled or collapsed replication forks and facilitate the resumption of processive DNA synthesis. This may be accomplished by helping to coordinate the various facets of the response, including delaying cell cycle progression, establishing cohesion for recombinational repair or other forms of repair, such as translesion synthesis. Further genetic characterization of these genes and biochemical characterization of their protein products is required to refine this proposed model, and help in elucidating the manner in which the different facets of the damage response are coordinated.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkh994f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> DNA damage sensitivity and complementation of <italic>wss1</italic>&#x00394;.
