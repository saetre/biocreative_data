Recent evidence indicates that an important component of the persistence strategy involves active interference with the MHC class I antigen processing pathway during the lytic replication cycle. We have now identified a novel role for the lytic cycle gene, <italic>BILF1</italic>, which encodes a glycoprotein with the properties of a constitutive signaling G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR). BILF1 reduced the levels of MHC class I at the cell surface and inhibited CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell recognition of endogenous target antigens. The underlying mechanism involves physical association of BILF1 with MHC class I molecules, an increased turnover from the cell surface, and enhanced degradation via lysosomal proteases. The BILF1 protein of the closely related CeHV15 &#x003b3;<sub>1</sub>-herpesvirus of the Rhesus Old World primate (80&#x00025; amino acid sequence identity) downregulated surface MHC class I similarly to EBV BILF1. Amongst the human herpesviruses, the GPCR encoded by the ORF74 of the KSHV &#x003b3;<sub>2</sub>-herpesvirus is most closely related to EBV BILF1 (15&#x00025; amino acid sequence identity) but did not affect levels of surface MHC class I. An engineered mutant of BILF1 that was unable to activate G protein signaling pathways retained the ability to downregulate MHC class I, indicating that the immune-modulating and GPCR-signaling properties are two distinct functions of BILF1. These findings extend our understanding of the normal biology of an important human pathogen. The discovery of a third EBV lytic cycle gene that cooperates to interfere with MHC class I antigen processing underscores the importance of the need for EBV to be able to evade CD8<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> T cell responses during the lytic replication cycle, at a time when such a large number of potential viral targets are expressed.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is a herpesvirus and an important human pathogen that can cause diseases ranging from non-malignant proliferative disease to fully malignant cancers of lymphocytes and epithelial cells. Nevertheless, the vast majority of people in all populations worldwide are infected with EBV. After primary infection the virus persists for the life of the infected individual, and usually without clinical symptoms. To understand how EBV causes disease, we also need to know how this virus is able to persist in healthy individuals with potent immune-responses. A picture is emerging which suggests that EBV, similar to non-tumorigenic herpesvirus, has multiple co-operating mechanisms to modulate immune responses by interfering with antigen processing pathway in cells undergoing lytic virus replication. We have now identified an EBV-encoded protein, BILF1, which targets MHC class I molecules for lysosomal degradation, leading to impaired recognition by immune T cells. BILF1 is a constitutively active G-protein-coupled receptor, but its effect on MHC class I degradation is independent of its signaling functions, and the molecular mechanisms are distinct from those identified in other viruses that induce degradation of MHC class I. This work aids our understanding of EBV biology and emphasizes the complexity of mechanisms evolved by viruses to enable persistent infection.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="16"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Viruses that persist asymptomatically in infected individuals need to evade or modulate immune responses, and particularly the adaptive T cell responses. A universal mechanism for virus persistence involves latency, where viral genes are transcriptionally silenced and, therefore, not available as targets for immune effectors. In addition, viruses may exhibit active immune-evasion mechanisms. In this context, the herpesviruses are paradigmatic.

To examine this in more detail, we generated a retroviral expression vector for BILF1, and transduced both 293 and MJS cells to generate stable cell lines expressing BILF1. Since the BILF1 in these retroviral vectors contained an N-terminal HA-tag sequence, expression of BILF1 in the transduced cells was initially confirmed by staining of viable cells with anti-HA mAb and flow cytometry analysis (data not shown). Staining with PE-W6/32 mAb confirmed that expression of MHC class I expression at the cell surface was reduced in BILF1-expressing 293 and MJS cells relative to paired lines transduced with a control retrovirus vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000255-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>).

The results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000255-g010">Fig. 10A</xref> are the mean of three independent experiments, and show that whereas transfection of wt-BILF1 typically induced more than a 5-fold increase in NF&#x003ba;B activity relative to the empty vector control transfectant, the K122A-BILF1 mutant did not induce any discernable NF&#x003ba;B activation above the vector control.

The effects of BILF1 on MHC class I were not critically dependent upon the activation of G-protein signaling, and were not exhibited by the most closely related human herpesvirus GPCR homolog, the ORF74 protein of KSHV, which has 15&#x00025; amino acid sequence identity with EBV BILF1.

Thus, CXCL12 ligand-induced activation of CXCR4 on malignant cancer cell lines and peripheral blood mononuclear cells triggered down-regulation of MHC class I from the cell surface. Mechanistically, this process involves physical association of CXCR4 with the &#x003b2;2-microglobulin component of mature MHC class I complexes, ubiquitination of the MHC class I heavy chain, and endocytosis of MHC complexes into a late endosomal/lysosomal compartment where degradation presumably occurs. Although BILF1 is unable to directly associate with &#x003b2;2-microglobulin (JZ, unpublished data) and we have no evidence that BILF1 induces ubiquination of MHC class I heavy chains above the levels seen in control BILF1<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000255-g006">Fig. 6</xref>), CXCR4 does share some broad features with the mechanism by which BILF1 downregulates MHC class I, which raises the possibility that targeting of the antigen processing pathway might not be a property uniquely associated with the &#x003b3;<sub>2</sub>-herpesvirus BILF1 vGPCRs. It is perhaps relevant that when co-expressed in the same cell, BILF1 and CXCR4 show almost complete co-localization (both being present predominantly in the plasma-membrane), whereas the KSHV-ORF74 and HCMV-US28 vGPCRs (predominantly intracellular) exhibit separate localizations to BILF1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000255-Paulsen1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Many other viral gene-products have been shown to target MHC class I molecules for degradation.

However, we cannot yet rule out the possibility that some MHC class I molecules might also be diverted before they reach the surface. An investigation of what adaptor molecules can associate with BILF1 will provide crucial information to elucidate the finer details of BILF1's mechanism of action. It also remains to be determined what are the sequence elements of BILF1 that are involved in its association with MHC class I molecules. Experiments are ongoing to resolve these unanswered questions.</p><p>It is perhaps surprising that BILF1 can inhibit T cell recognition so efficiently when it has a comparatively small effect on the levels of surface MHC class I (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000255-g002">Figs. 2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000255-g003"/><xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000255-g004">4</xref>). There are a number of possible explanations for this. First, BILF1 might target different HLA alleles with different efficiency. Thus, while HLA-A2, -B8, and B35 might be efficiently removed from the cell surface for degradation, other alleles recognized by W6/32 antibody may be unaffected and will mask the full extent that selected MHC molecules are being degraded. Secondly, the association of BILF1 with MHC class I molecules in the ER might interfere with Tapasin or TAP binding and thus interfere with correct peptide loading, while stabilizing a defective MHC complex and allowing egress from the ER. Thirdly, the association of BILF1 with MHC class I molecules at the cell surface might directly interfere with recognition by TCR. None of these possibilities is mutually exclusive, and further work is ongoing to test them.</p><p>In summary, through identifying and partially characterizing the molecular mechanisms of an immune-evasion function for BILF1, we have extended our understanding of the normal biology of an important human pathogen.
