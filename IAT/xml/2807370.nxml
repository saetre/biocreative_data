Fukutin-related protein (FKRP) was identified as a homolog of fukutin, the defective protein in Fukuyama-type congenital muscular dystrophy (FCMD), that is thought to function as a glycosyltransferase. Mutations in FKRP have been linked to a variety of phenotypes including Walker&#x02013;Warburg syndrome (WWS), limb girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD) 2I and congenital muscular dystrophy 1C (MDC1C). Zebrafish are a useful animal model to reveal the mechanism of these diseases caused by mutations in FKRP gene. Downregulating FKRP expression in zebrafish by two different morpholinos resulted in embryos which had developmental defects similar to those observed in human muscular dystrophies associated with mutations in FKRP. The FKRP morphants showed phenotypes involving alterations in somitic structure and muscle fiber organization, as well as defects in developing eye morphology. Additionally, they were found to have a reduction in &#x003b1;-dystroglycan glycosylation and a shortened myofiber length. Moreover, co-injection of fish or human FKRP mRNA along with the morpholino restored normal development, &#x003b1;-dystroglycan glycosylation and laminin binding activity of &#x003b1;-dystroglycan in the morphants. Co-injection of the human FKRP mRNA containing causative mutations found in human patients of WWS, MDC1C and LGMD2I could not restore their phenotypes significantly. Interestingly, these morphant fish having human FKRP mutations showed a wide phenotypic range similar to that seen in humans.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Several muscular dystrophies have been associated with glycosylation defects of dystroglycan. Dystroglycan is a central component of the dystrophin&#x02013;glycoprotein complex (DGC), a large protein complex essential for maintaining the integrity of the sarcolemma by connecting components of the extracellular matrix (ECM) to the internal cytoskeleton of the muscle fiber. No human diseases have been associated with the dystroglycan gene mutations. However, dag1-null mice showed embryonic lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP528C1">1</xref>), suggesting that dystroglycan function is critical for normal embryogenesis. Mature dystroglycan consists of two isoforms (&#x003b1;- and &#x003b2;- dystroglycan) generated by post-translational cleavage of a precursor protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP528C2">2</xref>). Additionally, &#x003b1;-dystroglycan subunit is capable of binding to a variety of laminin isoforms and the proteoglycan molecules agrin, perlecan and neurexins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP528C2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP528C5">5</xref>).</p><p>Several forms of muscular dystrophy are associated with the defective glycosylation of &#x003b1;-dystroglycan and are caused by mutations in six genes encoding putative glycosyltransferases: POMGnT1, POMT1, POMT2, Fukutin, fukutin-related protein (FKRP) and LARGE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP528C6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP528C13">13</xref>). These diseases include severe forms of congenital muscular dystrophy associated with structural brain defects and variable eye involvement such as Fukuyama-type congenital muscular dystrophy (FCMD), muscle&#x02013;eye&#x02013;brain (MEB) disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP528C14">14</xref>) and Walker&#x02013;Warburg syndrome (WWS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP528C15">15</xref>). Mutations in the glycosyltransferase genes also cause much milder muscular dystrophies such as the limb girdle muscular dystrophies (LGMD) types 2I and 2K (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP528C16">16</xref>). In some cases, a spectrum of disease severity can result from different mutations in any one of these putative glycosyltransferase genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP528C6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP528C7">7</xref>). The pathology of these disorders has been attributed to the failure of the resulting hypoglycosylated dystroglycan to bind to components of the ECM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP528C17">17</xref>).</p><p>FKRP was identified as a homolog of fukutin, the defective protein on FCMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP528C13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP528C18">18</xref>). The primary protein sequence predicted from the gene sequence indicates homology to a class of proteins that are thought to function as glycosyltransferases, specifically mediating O-linked glycosylation. The role of FKRP in the glycosylation of &#x003b1;-dystroglycan remains unclear. FKRP has been proposed as a putative glycosyltransferase based on similar sequences to other glycosyltransferases; however, this activity has not been confirmed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP528C19">19</xref>). Mutations in FKRP have been linked to variable phenotypes including congenital muscular dystrophy, also referred to as MDC1C, and LGMD2I that may or may not be accompanied by dilated cardiomyopathy. The range of phenotypic severity due to FKRP mutations is very large and is not usually observed for other genes involved with muscular dystrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP528C18">18</xref>). Some reports of FKRP mutations include descriptions of founder mutations in the European population (826C &#x0003e; A, L276I) and the Tunisian population (1364C &#x0003e; A, A455D) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP528C18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP528C20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP528C21">21</xref>). Moreover, recent reports showed that some mutations in FKRP gene caused WWS (953G &#x0003e; A, C318Y) and MEB (919T &#x0003e; A, Y307N) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP528C22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP528C23">23</xref>).</p><p>Zebrafish represent a good model to investigate genes involved in muscle development and degeneration, and they serve as a good model for muscular dystrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP528C19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP528C24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP528C31">31</xref>). The zebrafish expresses orthologues of many DGC components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP528C32">32</xref>). Zebrafish have glycosyltransferases with strong homology to the human forms including FKRP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP528C33">33</xref>). Using a morpholino against FKRP, the resulting knocked down morphants showed an abnormal formation of muscle and eye analogous to the human diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP528C34">34</xref>). These results demonstrate the possibility of the animal model of dysfunction of this glycosyltransferase.</p><p>In the present study, we have knocked down FKRP expression in the zebrafish using two different morpholinos and obtained the same phenotypes in the resulting morphants as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP528C34">34</xref>). FKRP morphant embryos show defects in muscle organization, eye development and reduction in &#x003b1;-dystroglycan glycosylation. In addition, co-injection of a control FKRP mRNA or mutated FKRP mRNAs either corrected pathology or mimicked human clinical conditions. Interestingly, the developmental symptoms in the FKRP morphant were restored by injection of control FKRP mRNA, not by mutated human FKRP mRNAs. Moreover, injection of human FKRP restored the reduction of &#x003b1;-dystroglycan glycosylation and laminin binding to &#x003b1;-dystroglycan. Our data suggest that the fish model of human FKRP mutations is useful to investigate the pathogenesis associated with the FKRP gene and serves to elucidate the role of FKRP in developmental processes associated with the glycosylation of &#x003b1;-dystroglycan.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2a"><title>FKRP morphant morphology</title><p>We began the study of the function of FKRP in zebrafish embryo development by using two anti-sense morpholino oligonucleotides (MO) to disrupt the translation of FKRP mRNA during development. MO1 and MO2 were targeted to regions containing the 5'-untranslated region (MO2) and the start codon of fish FKRP mRNA (MO1). The binding regions of MO1 and MO2 were not overlapping. At 1 dpf, FKRP morphant injected FKRP MO1 (6 ng) and FKRP morphant injected FKRP MO2 (6 ng) had abnormal formation of their heads and eyes (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ddp528/DC1">Supplementary Data S1</ext-link>). Moreover, the organization of their muscles was abnormal in both FKRP morphants compared with controls. FKRP morphants displayed alterations in somite morphology observed as curved somite boundaries that are distinct from the regular v-shaped pattern observed in control MO injected embryos (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ddp528/DC1">Supplementary Data S1</ext-link>). At 1 dpf, mildly affected morphant embryos were also found to have curved tails and a slight curvature of the somite boundaries like previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP528C34">34</xref>). At 1 dpf, the frequency of observed abnormalities was correlated with injection of increasing amounts of both FKRP MO1 and 2 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ddp528/DC1">Supplementary Data S2</ext-link>).</p><p>At 4 dpf, the frequency of observed developmental abnormalities was also found to correlate in a dose-dependant fashion with amounts of both FKRP MO1 and 2 injected (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ddp528/DC1">Supplementary Data S2</ext-link>). Injection of 6 ng of MO1 resulted in a mixture of different fish phenotypes with &#x0223c;40% of injected fish exhibiting developmental abnormalities, 40% appearing normal and 20% of them dead. Fish injected with 3 ng of MO2 also had a mixture of different phenotypes with 40% of injected fish exhibiting developmental abnormalities, 20% appearing normal and 40% of them dead. Injection of control morpholinos to both of MO1 and MO2 (mis-matched at 5 bases; see Materials and Methods) resulted in few observed abnormalities which were likely caused by the injection procedure (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ddp528/DC1">Supplementary Data S2</ext-link>).</p><p>FKRP morphant embryos lacked locomotor activity and did not respond to touch with the normal escape response observed in control embryos. Overall, FKRP morphants appeared to have a smaller eye size compared with controls (arrows in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP528F1">1</xref>G and I) and many had inflated precardia (arrowheads in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP528F1">1</xref>G and I). FKRP morphant embryos were also found to have an irregular arrangement of muscle fibers compared with control embryos (arrows in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP528F2">2</xref>G and I). To better visualize the structure and organization of muscle fibers of the morphants, FKRP morphant and control embryos at 4 dpf were analyzed by birefringence assays (Figs&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP528F1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP528F2">2</xref>). FKRP morphant embryos were found to have markedly reduced normal patterns of birefringence compared with control (Figs&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP528F1">1</xref>H and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP528F1">1</xref>J and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP528F2">2</xref>H and I). To confirm the knock down of the expression of fish FKRP with morpholino injection, endogenous FKRP protein was analyzed with antibodies against fish FKRP. In control MO1 and MO2, the FKRP directed antibody recognized 60 kDa protein on western blots, a size predicted by the fish FKRP sequence. The analysis of morphant 1 and 2 extracts showed that the expression of FKRP protein in morphants was substantially decreased compared with those of control MO1- and MO2-injected fish (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP528F2">2</xref>K). Western blot results show that the morpholinos used in these injections were effective in knocking down the expression of FKRP during zebrafish development.</p><fig id="DDP528F1" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1.</label><caption><p>Head and body in FKRP morphant at 4 dpf.

Abnormalities were not only confined to skeletal muscle but also in neurological tissues including the eye and there were clear heart abnormalities. It is known that mutations in the FKRP gene are associated with a spectrum of neuromuscular human diseases ranging from very mild LGMD2I to severe MDC1C and the most severe types called MEB and WWS with neurological and ocular abnormalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP528C13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP528C18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP528C36">36</xref>). Similar to what is observed in patients with human mutations, FKRP morphant embryos had reduction in eye diameter and muscle abnormalities, similar to results seen by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP528C34">34</xref>). These results suggest that FKRP morphants have characteristics which parallel clinical findings in human patients. In LGMD2I and MDC1C patients, clinical findings in muscle and dilated cardiomyopathy have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP528C37">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP528C40">40</xref>). The findings in these FKRP morphants suggest that FKRP morphant fish may have the characteristics similar to myopathy, neuropathy and cardiomyopathy system involvement in human disease. Using this fish model, further studies focused on brain, eyes and heart may be useful for understanding the mechanism of diseases in these systems.</p><p>In skeletal muscle, FKRP morphant fish have disturbed glycosylation of &#x003b1;-dystroglycan and abnormal muscle structure including myofiber size and an apparent gap at the myosepta. Previous reports have also showed the effects on the glycosylation of &#x003b1;-dystroglycan and on binding to the ECM ligand laminin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP528C34">34</xref>). The linking between &#x003b1;-dystroglycan and ECM proteins with sugar chain of &#x003b1;-dystroglycan is known to be important for supporting stable muscle structures. These structures rely on the effective glycosylation of &#x003b1;-dystroglycan and carbohydrate modifications and are either absent or reduced resulting in a predicted decrease in binding of &#x003b1;-dystroglycan to its ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP528C41">41</xref>). A muscle degenerative phenotype has also been described in morpholino-directed dystroglycan knockdown fish embryos in which there is a disruption of the DGC resulting in abnormalities in muscle fiber organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP528C42">42</xref>).</p><p>The expression of dystrophin and &#x003b2;-dystroglycan was normal in the skeletal muscle of FKRP morphant; however, myosepta were irregular and there is a wide gap between myofibers when compared with the control. These findings indicate that modification of sugar chains on &#x003b1;-dystroglycan may play a critical role in maintaining myosepta length and the spacing between myosepta. The lack of sugar modification likely causes a disconnection between myofibers, and the muscle degeneration decreased upon birefringence.</p><p>Somewhat surprising was the observation that the human FKRP protein functions to partially restore normal fish muscle structure. In addition, human FKRP mRNA with mutations causing muscular dystrophy in humans is less effective at restoring structure compared with normal human FKRP. This suggests that FKRP functions in the glycosylation of &#x003b1;-dystroglycan thus making this model particularly appropriate for studies on the group of human diseases caused by FKRP mutations. This model could also be used to map domains on the human and fish FKRP proteins which are important for normal development and function.</p><p>Interestingly, the FKRP morphants co-injected with human FKRP mutations have a wide phenotypic range. In the LGMD2I model fish with L276I mutation, the phenotypes were generally mild similar to human patients with this mutation. In LGMD2I patient, the clinical findings in muscle and heart are mild compared with CMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP528C18">18</xref>). The reduced abnormalities and laminin binding ability of &#x003b1;-dystroglycan in fish co-injected with the human L276I mutation are consistent with human relatively mild clinical finding course.</p><p>The zebrafish models exhibited phenotypes similar to the severe CMD and WWS with C318Y and MDC1C with A455D mutations. In MDC1C, the muscle clinical findings are severe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP528C13">13</xref>) and in WWS, the clinical findings include neurological, heart and skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP528C22">22</xref>) and analogous to this. C318Y mutation had abnormalities in eye formation similar to those seen in WWS human patients.</p><p>In conclusion, these fish models of the human disease may be very useful for understanding the pathogenesis of diseases caused by mutations in the FKRP gene. Further investigation using these knockdown fish models and those fish bearing human mutations which yield similar phenotypes to human disease may give clues to the function of FKRP in the glycosylation of &#x003b1;-dystroglycan and the maintaining of normal muscle. These studies aid our understanding of the phenotypic spectrum in human muscular dystrophies associated with mutations in the FKRP gene and these fish models are very useful in testing for therapeutic compounds for these muscular dystrophies.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Fish strains and maintenance</title><p>The zebrafish wild-type strain (AB) was used in this study.
