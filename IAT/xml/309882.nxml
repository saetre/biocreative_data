The highly purified RNA polymerase II contained more than eleven polypeptides. The sizes of the largest the second-, and the third-largest polypeptides as measured by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis were about 210, 150, and 40 kilodaltons (kDa), respectively, and are similar to those of RPB1, 2, and 3 subunits of Saccharomyces cerevisiae RNA polymerase II. Using the degenerated primers designed after amino acid micro-sequencing of the 40 kDa third-largest polypeptide (subunit 3), we cloned the subunit 3 gene (rpb3) and determined its DNA sequence. Taken together with the sequence of parts of PCR-amplified cDNA, the predicted coding sequence of rpb3, interrupted by two introns, was found to encode a polypeptide of 297 amino acid residues in length with a molecular weight of 34 kDa. The S. pombe subunit 3 contains four structural domains conserved for the alpha-subunit family of RNA polymerase from both eukaryotes and prokaryotes. A putative leucine zipper motif was found to exist in the C-terminal proximal conserved region (domain D). Possible functions of the conserved domains are discussed.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00065-0148-a" xlink:role="3751"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00065-0149-a" xlink:role="3752"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00065-0146.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3749"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00065-0147.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3750"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00065-0148.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3751"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00065-0149.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3752"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00065-0150.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3753"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00065-0151.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="3754"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
