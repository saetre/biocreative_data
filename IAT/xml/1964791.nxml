The chemokine eotaxin-1 is a powerful eosinophil attractant but also exerts chemotaxis of other leukocytes. Eotaxin-1 has been implicated in gastrointestinal disorders and may play an important role in colorectal mucosal immunity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Patients and methods</title><p>The objective of this study was to assess the role of eotaxin-1 in colorectal cancer (CRC). Levels of eotaxin-1 protein in CRC tissues (n = 86) and paired normal mucosa were compared after determination by ELISA. Plasma eotaxin-1 levels from CRC patients (n = 67) were also compared with controls (n = 103) using the same method. Moreover, a TaqMan system was used to evaluate the -384A&#x0003e;G eotaxin-1 gene variant in CRC patients (n = 241) and in a control group (n = 253).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Eotaxin-1 protein levels in colorectal tumours were significantly (P &#x0003c; 0.0001) higher than in normal tissue. Immunohistochemistry revealed eotaxin-1 expression in stromal cells such as fibroblasts and leukocytes of the CRC tissue. The plasma eotaxin-1 level in CRC patients was lower compared with controls (P &#x0003c; 0.0001). Patients with tumours classified as Dukes' stage B and C had lower levels than patients with tumours in Dukes' stage A. We found no difference in genotype distribution but noted a difference regarding allele distribution (P = 0.036) and a dominance of allele G in rectal cancer patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The up-regulated eotaxin-1 protein expression in cancer tissue may reflect an eotaxin-1 mediated angiogenesis and/or a recruitment of leukocytes with potential antitumourigenic role. We noticed a dominance of the G allele in rectal cancer patients compared with colon cancer patients that was independent of eotaxin-1 expression.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Previous studies show that chemokines (chemotactic cytokines) are important factors promoting leukocyte attraction to sites of inflammation and cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Some of the chemokines may promote and regulate neoplastic progression including metastasis and angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>].</p><p>In the gastrointestinal tract the intestinal mucosa regulates trafficking of the leukocytes by chemokines such as CXCL5, CXCL8 and CXCL12 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The chemokine eotaxin-1 (CCL11) is one member of the eotaxin gene family (eotaxin-1, eotaxin-2 and eotaxin-3) which is a group of eosinophil chemoattractants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Eotaxin-1 binds exclusively to the receptor CCR3, which is present on eosinophils. Basophils, mast cells, Th2 cells, dendritic cells and endothelial cells also express CCR3 at variable levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Eosinophil accumulation in the peripheral blood and tissues is a marker of several diseases such as viral and parasitic infections, atopic disorders, eosinophilic gastroenteritis and pneumonia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In the gastrointestinal tract, eotaxin-1 is expressed in mucosa and it has been suggested that eotaxin-1 has an important role in the maintenance of normal eosinophil homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The expression of eotaxin-1 has been identified in macrophages, eosinophils, epithelial cells, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, malignant epithelial cells and smooth muscle cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Consequently, eosinophils seem to have the capacity to generate their own autocrine chemoattractant factor eotaxin-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>Eotaxin-1 may play a role in a number of chronic inflammatory diseases such as sinusitis, nasal polyposis, rhinitis, ulcerative colitis and other gastrointestinal disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Increased plasma levels of eotaxin-1 have been shown in coronary artery disease and inflammatory bowel disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Moreover, it has been suggested that eotaxin-1 may protect against tumour progression by recruiting eosinophils with a capacity to release cytotoxic proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>Several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the eotaxin-1 gene have recently been described. One of these, the -384A&#x0003e;G variant, is located at the promoter region of the eotaxin-1 gene and has been shown to have functional effects on eotaxin-1 synthesis. This variant correlated significantly with an elevated plasma eotaxin-1 level in asthmatic patients. It has been postulated that the -384A&#x0003e;G locus may exert its influence through change in the eotaxin-1 gene transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>The aim of the present study was to investigate the relation of eotaxin-1 protein expression to, and the influence of the eotaxin-1 gene variant -384A&#x0003e;G on CRC.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>This investigation was approved by the research ethical committee at the Faculty of Health Sciences, Link&#x000f6;ping, Sweden (Dnr. 98113).

The patient group represented 123 males and 118 females with a mean age of 70 years (range 29&#x02013;93). All tumours were classified according to Dukes' classification system: stage A (n = 45), stage B (n = 102), stage C (n = 82), and stage D (n = 12). The tumours were localized in the colon (n = 121) and rectum (n = 120).</p><p>Blood donors (n = 253), from Ryhov County Hospital with no known CRC history and a normal blood status, were selected as controls. This group consisted of 133 males and 120 females, with a mean age of 68 years (range 50&#x02013;83). All blood-controls came from the same geographical region as the CRC patients and all cases and controls were of Swedish Caucasian origin.

Patient blood was collected before surgery. All blood, including that from the control group, was separated by centrifugation within 1 h. Plasma was removed and stored at -70&#x000b0;C. The CRC patient group comprised 38 males and 29 females with a mean age of 69 years (range 29&#x02013;88). The patient tumours were categorized according to Dukes' classification; stage A (n = 15), stage B (n = 29), and stage C (n = 23). Thirty-five tumours were located in the rectum and 32 in the colon.

The plasma eotaxin-1 concentration from CRC patients and control subjects was expressed as picograms per millilitre (pg/ml) and the eotaxin-1 protein levels of cancer and paired normal tissues from the CRC patients were expressed as picograms per milligram of protein (pg/mg).</p></sec><sec><title>Immunohistochemistry of eotaxin-1</title><p>Fourteen tumour samples were available for immunohistochemical staining for determination of the cell type origin of eotaxin-1 expression.

Sections were subsequently incubated with a primary mouse anti-human monoclonal CCL11/eotaxin-1 antibody (R&#x00026;D Systems Europe, UK) in appropriate dilution overnight at 4&#x000b0;C. After rinsing in TRIS-buffered saline, sections were incubated with secondary biotinylated goat anti-mouse IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, USA). Avidin-biotin peroxidase complexes (Dako Cytomation Denmark) were added, followed by visualization with 3,3'-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (Dako Cytomation).

We found a significantly lower eotaxin-1 plasma level in CRC patients than in controls, and this difference increases with increasing Dukes' stage. Referring to the studies above [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], and our investigation, the findings indicate that there may be different mechanisms of immune regulation in different disease entities. Our study may show an imbalance in production of plasma eotaxin-1 from eosinophils or endothelial cells in CRC patients, and that a lower plasma eotaxin-1 level may reflect disease status of CRC. The discrepancy between tissue and plasma level ratio of eotaxin-1 in CRC may be explained by a biological difference that influences the secretion of eotaxin-1 in CRC tissue.</p><p>Using ELISA, we noted a significantly higher expression of eotaxin-1 protein in cancer tissue in comparison to matched normal tissue. Evaluation of the relative expression (tumour vs. normal tissue) showed 74.4% up-regulation. By using immunohistochemistry to determine the origin of the eotaxin-1 protein expression in CRC patient tissues we found immunoreactivity localised to stromal cells such as fibroblasts and leukocytes.</p><p>Very few reports have investigated eotaxin-1 expressing cells in relation to CRC outcome. Higher amount of eosinophilic infiltration of CRC has been reported to be a favourable prognostic indicator in CRC patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. On the other hand, gastric carcinoma with eosinophilia correlates with unfavourable prognosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. It has been suggested that eotaxin-1 directly mediates angiogenesis by CCR3<sup>+ </sup>endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. This effect may contribute to tumour growth and thereby poor prognosis in CRC. Thus, the role of eotaxin-1 and eosinophilia is not fully evaluated in CRC. We noted a significantly up-regulated eotaxin-1 level in cancer tissue which may reflect a potential eotaxin-1 mediated angiogenesis. Alternatively, this could mediate protection against tumour progress by recruitment of eosinophils and/or other CCR3<sup>+ </sup>leukocytes with an antitumourigenic role.</p><p>The pathophysiological significance of the observed up-regulation remains unclear until basal mechanisms describing the transcriptional regulation and the signalling pathway of eotaxin-1 expression in CRC are elucidated. To date, little is known with regard to the influence of eotaxin-1 gene polymorphisms on the levels of eotaxin-1 in normal and neoplastic human tissues.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We noticed a dominance of the G allele in rectal cancer patients compared with colon cancer patients that was independent of eotaxin-1 expression. The -384A&#x0003e;G eotaxin-1 gene variant may be partly involved in the pathogenesis of cancer in the rectum and colon. The up-regulated eotaxin-1 protein expression in cancer tissue represented by stromal cells may reflect an eotaxin-1 mediated angiogenesis and/or a recruitment of leukocytes with potential antitumourigenic effect. Finally, the plasma levels of eotaxin-1 were lower in CRC patients compared to controls, and the suppression seems to be more pronounced in severe disease stage.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The author(s) declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>DW: Conceived the study, participated in its design, revised and helped in preparing the manuscript.</p><p>SL: Organized the laboratory work, revised and edited the manuscript.</p><p>AH: Surgeon who performed resection of the patient tissue and documented clinico-pathological characteristics.</p><p>OD: Carried out the genotyping and contributed to collection of the data.</p><p>JD: Performed the immunohistochemical study, the statistical analysis, the literature search, and prepared the manuscript.</p><p>All authors read and approved the final manuscript.</p></sec></body><back><ack><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Grants were received from Futurum-the academy of health care, County Council of J&#x000f6;nk&#x000f6;ping, Sweden, and from the University College of Health Sciences, J&#x000f6;nk&#x000f6;ping, Sweden.
