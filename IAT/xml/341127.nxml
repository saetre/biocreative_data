Of the three inducible clones isolated, we have identified one as being apolipoprotein A-IV (apo A-IV) by its extensive homology with a rat apolipoprotein A-IV cDNA sequence. The level of liver apo A-IV mRNA increases rapidly in response to either of two porphyrogenic drugs. When the ferrochelatase-inhibited drug, 3,5-dicarbethoxy-1,4-dihydrocollidine (DDC) is used, a 6 and 28 fold induction of liver apo A-IV mRNA is observed in male and female mice, respectively. If the heme-destroying porphyrogenic drug, allylisopropylacetamide (AIA) is the inducing agent, liver apo A-IV mRNA levels increase 2-3 fold in both males and females. The level of apo A-IV mRNA reaches a maximum within 6-10 hr. after drug administration. Intestine apo A-IV mRNA levels do not change during either of these drug-induced porphyrias. RNA from acute-phase responsive liver or liver from mice treated with bilirubin, porphobilinogen, or protoporphyrin IX show no increase in apo A-IV mRNA. These results indicate that apo A-IV induction is tied to a disruption in porphyrin-heme biosynthesis but is not directly affected by several heme intermediates nor by the major heme degradation product, bilirubin.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00300-0147-a" xlink:role="1958"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00300-0148-a" xlink:role="1959"/></fig><fig id="F3"><graphic xlink:href="nar00300-0150-a" xlink:role="1961"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00300-0142.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1953"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00300-0143.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1954"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00300-0144.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1955"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00300-0145.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1956"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00300-0146.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1957"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00300-0147.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1958"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00300-0148.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1959"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00300-0149.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1960"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00300-0150.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1961"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00300-0151.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1962"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00300-0152.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="1963"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
