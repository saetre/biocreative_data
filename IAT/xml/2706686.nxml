PTEN function appears to be modulated by subcellular compartmentalization, and mislocalization may affect function. We have shown that cellular ATP levels affect nuclear PTEN levels. Here, we examined the ATP-binding capabilities of PTEN and functional consequences, relevant to cancer-associated mutations. <italic>PTEN</italic> mutation analysis of CS patients and sporadic colorectal carcinomas and comparative aminoacid analysis were utilized to identify mutations in ATP-binding motifs. The ability of wild-type (WT) or mutant PTEN to bind ATP was assessed by ATP&#x02013;agarose-binding assays. Subcellular fractionation, western blotting, confocal microscopy and growth assays were used to determine relative nuclear-cytoplasmic localization and function. Somatic colorectal carcinoma-derived <italic>PTEN</italic> missense mutations were associated with nuclear mislocalization. These mutations altered cellular proliferation, apoptosis and anchorage-dependent growth. Examination of PTEN's amino acid sequence revealed these mutations resided in previously undescribed ATP-binding motifs (c.60&#x02013;73; c.122&#x02013;136). In contrast to WT PTEN, both cancer-associated somatic and germline-derived <italic>PTEN</italic> missense mutations, which lie within the ATP-binding motifs, result in mutant PTEN that does not bind ATP efficiently. We also show that CS patients with germline ATP-binding motif-mutations had nuclear PTEN mislocalization. Of four unrelated patients with functional germline ATP-binding domain mutations, all three female patients had breast cancers. Germline and somatic mutations within PTEN's ATP-binding domain play important pathogenic roles in both heritable and sporadic carcinogenesis by PTEN nuclear mislocalization resulting in altered signaling and growth. Manipulation of ATP may represent novel therapies in tumors with such PTEN alterations.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Germline mutations in <italic>PTEN</italic> (<underline><italic>p</italic></underline>hosphatase and <underline><italic>ten</italic></underline>sin homolog deleted on chromosome <underline>10</underline>; MIM# 601728), encoding a lipid and protein phosphatase that mediates cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, were first described in Cowden syndrome [CS; MIM# 158350] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP220C1">1</xref>). Germline <italic>PTEN</italic> mutations have been identified in 85% of CS probands, who carry an up to 50% risk of female breast cancer and 10% risk of epithelial thyroid cancer. Subsequently, 65% of patients with the developmental disorder Bannayan&#x02013;Riley&#x02013;Ruvalcaba syndrome and variable frequencies of individuals with several other related syndromes were also shown to carry germline <italic>PTEN</italic> mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP220C2">2</xref>). Similarly, somatic mutations or deletions of <italic>PTEN</italic> have been identified in a broad range of sporadic tumor types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP220C2">2</xref>).</p><p>Initial reports suggested that PTEN localized exclusively to the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP220C3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP220C4">4</xref>). However, it is now well established that a significant pool of PTEN protein is localized to, and functional within, the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP220C4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP220C8">8</xref>). Decreased nuclear (wild-type, WT) PTEN (WTPTEN) has been associated with more aggressive disease in patients with colorectal cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP220C9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP220C10">10</xref>), cutaneous melanoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP220C11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP220C12">12</xref>), esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP220C13">13</xref>), pancreatic islet cell tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP220C14">14</xref>) and cases of large B cell lymphoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP220C15">15</xref>). Nuclear PTEN appears to play a role in cell cycle regulation, MAPK phosphorylation and modulating cyclin D1 levels in various cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP220C7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP220C16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP220C18">18</xref>). Furthermore, nuclear PTEN is involved in chromosome stability and DNA repair processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP220C19">19</xref>). Together, this indicates that the tumor suppressive function of PTEN is partly mediated through its nuclear localization and/or retention.</p><p>Despite ample evidence indicating that PTEN localizes in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP220C7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP220C17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP220C20">20</xref>), PTEN contains neither a traditional nuclear localization signal (NLS) nor a nuclear export signal (NES). Several methods have been implicated in modulating PTEN localization; however, these appear to be cell type dependent. These include passive diffusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP220C18">18</xref>), a putative cytoplasmic retention signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP220C6">6</xref>), transport mediated by either the Ran GTPase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP220C7">7</xref>), or Major Vault Protein (MVP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP220C5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP220C21">21</xref>), phosphorylation-dependent shuttling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP220C7">7</xref>), monoubiquitination-dependent import (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP220C8">8</xref>) and S6K-mediated export (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP220C22">22</xref>). Recently, we have shown that intracellular localization of PTEN can be modulated by ATP levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP220C23">23</xref>). However, the exact mechanism remained unknown. Interestingly, other proteins whose subcellular localization is modulated by ATP, such as Hsc70 and nucleophosmin/B23, bind ATP through consensus ATP-binding domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP220C24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP220C26">26</xref>).</p><p>We, therefore, hypothesize that since the intracellular localization of PTEN is modulated by ATP, PTEN can bind to ATP and that this interaction could influence its intracellular localization. In this study, we sought to examine the ATP-binding capabilities of PTEN, and to evaluate the importance of germline CS-related <italic>PTEN</italic> mutations and cancer-derived somatic <italic>PTEN</italic> missense mutations occurring within these ATP-binding sites in influencing nuclear PTEN localization and function.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Specific somatic misssense mutations affect PTEN localization, cellular growth and proliferation <italic>in vitro</italic></title><p>We, and others, have shown that PTEN can be localized to both the cytoplasmic and nuclear compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP220C6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP220C8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP220C17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP220C23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP220C27">27</xref>). Putative sites in PTEN have been postulated to be important in regulating nuclear localization, such as those shown <italic>in vitro</italic> to bind to MVP, one PTEN-interacting protein which mediates nuclear import (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP220C5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP220C21">21</xref>), and those that mediate ubiquitination and genomic stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP220C8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP220C19">19</xref>). However, naturally occurring <italic>PTEN</italic> mutations found within the latter two are extremely limited. We were surprised to note that PTEN was found to be mislocalized in the nucleus, by immunohistochemistry, in sporadic primary colorectal carcinomas harboring the K62R, Y65C and K125E missense mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP220C9">9</xref>); yet, the three somatic mutations found in these primary tumors were not specifically located in any of the known regions within PTEN believed to be important for nuclear localization, as noted above.</p><p>To explore the effects of these mutations further, we modeled these mutations <italic>in vitro</italic>. We generated FLAG-tagged protein as described in the Materials and Methods. Subcellular localization of these mutant proteins was performed utilizing both immunofluorescence and western analysis. We found that transiently transfected full-length over-expressed WTPTEN localized to both the cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments in MCF7 cells as previously described (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP220F1">1</xref>A) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP220C5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP220C17">17</xref>). However, when we analyzed the sporadic carcinoma-derived somatic mutations in transfected MCF7 cells, we found that the K62R (pK62R-FLAG) and Y65C (pY65C-FLAG) mutant PTEN displayed a predominant nuclear accumulation, when compared with WTPTEN (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP220F1">1</xref>A) as evidenced by DAPI counterstaining (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP220F1">1</xref>A, panels c, f, i and l). The K125E mutant PTEN (pK125E-FLAG) also showed a preference towards nuclear accumulation. However, this localization was not as strong as that observed in cells expressing either the K62R or Y65C mutant PTEN (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP220F1">1</xref>A). Nevertheless, the K125E mutant PTEN localized to the nuclear compartment to a greater extent than WTPTEN.</p><fig id="DDP220F1" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1.</label><caption><p>Neoplasia-derived PTEN mutants results in increased nuclear PTEN localization.

Exogenously expressed K62R, Y65C and K125E PTEN mutants showed an increase in nuclear fraction protein levels, when compared with WTPTEN (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP220F1">1</xref>B). In concordance with the immunofluoresence data, the K62R and Y65C PTEN mutants showed the highest amount of nuclear PTEN protein accumulation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP220F1">1</xref>B).</p><p>It has been suggested that proper cellular localization, or more accurately proper balance between nuclear and cytoplasmic localization, of PTEN regulates cellular proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP220C4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP220C6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP220C7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP220C27">27</xref>). Thus, we examined the effect of overexpression of these PTEN mutants on proliferation. As expected, overexpression of WTPTEN, in MCF7 cells, markedly reduced the rate of cell proliferation, when compared with the parental cell line or to cells transfected with vector control (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP220F2">2</xref>A and B). In contrast, MCF7 cells overexpressing the cancer-associated PTEN mutants, K62R, Y65C or K125E, had proliferation rates similar to, or higher than, that of the vector only control. MCF7 cells overexpressing the K125E mutant PTEN had the highest rate of proliferation (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP220F2">2</xref>A and B). This suggests that these mutants do, indeed, have a functional effect, at least <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p><fig id="DDP220F2" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;2.</label><caption><p>Neoplasia-derived <italic>PTE</italic>N mutations result in a loss of growth suppressive activity.

MCF7 cells overexpressing WTPTEN had a significantly reduced ability to grow in soft agarose when compared with vector only and non-transfected parental MCF7 cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP220F2">2</xref>C). In contrast, MCF7 cells expressing the K62R, Y65C or K125E PTEN mutant protein exhibited a capacity for anchorage-independent growth that was greater than that produced by the vector only expressing MCF7cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP220F2">2</xref>C). Interestingly, cells expressing the K125E mutant PTEN protein produced the highest number of colonies (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP220F2">2</xref>C). Cells expressing the Y65C mutant PTEN had the lowest level of anchorage-independent growth of the three mutant expressing lines, however colony formation was still higher than colony formation found in cells overexpressing WTPTEN. Interestingly, we also observed a difference in colony size in MCF7 cells overexpresing either K62R mutant PTEN or Y65C mutant PTEN when compared with the vector only and cells overexpressing K125E mutant PTEN (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP220F2">2</xref>D).</p><p>It is well known that overexpression of WTPTEN induces G1 growth arrest and/or apoptosis in a cell type-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP220C4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP220C17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP220C27">27</xref>). Thus, we examined the effect of these three mutations on G1 arrest. While overexpression of WTPTEN resulted in a 40&#x02013;50% increase in G1 arrest, when compared with parental or vector only transfected cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP220F2">2</xref>E), MCF7 cells overexpressing any of the mutant PTEN proteins exhibited a decreased level of G1 arrest when compared with WTPTEN (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP220F2">2</xref>E). Indeed, the level of G1 arrest exhibited in cells expressing the K125E mutant was even lower than those observed with the vector only control transfected cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP220F2">2</xref>E). Using the TUNEL assay, we found that overexpression of WTPTEN led to a 5-fold increase in the number of apoptotic cells (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP220F2">2</xref>F and G) compared with control cells. In contrast, cells overexpressing either K62R or Y65C mutant PTEN had reduced apoptotic capabilities (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP220F2">2</xref>F and G), while the K125E mutant PTEN was unable to induce any apoptosis (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP220F2">2</xref>F and G).</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>PTEN contains ATP-binding motifs in the N-terminal phosphatase domain</title><p>The above data indicate that the carcinoma-derived somatic <italic>PTEN</italic> mutations not only show increased nuclear retention, but also are highly pro-proliferative and induce a loss of growth-inhibitory activity, in contrast to those cells expressing WTPTEN. Further, this appears to be related to the nuclear localization of these mutant proteins. However, it is not readily apparent how these mutations affect nuclear localization. We have recently shown that PTEN localization can be modulated by intracellular ATP levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP220C23">23</xref>). Proteins that are regulated by ATP often contain consensus ATP-binding motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP220C24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP220C25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP220C28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP220C29">29</xref>). Upon examination, we found that PTEN's amino acid sequence contains two putative ATP-binding sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP220C28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP220C29">29</xref>), in the N-terminal phosphatase domain of the protein (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP220F3">3</xref>A and B). A Type-A consensus ATP-binding sequence resides at amino acid residues 125&#x02013;128 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP220F3">3</xref>A) and a Type-B consensus ATP-binding sequence resides at amino acid residues 60&#x02013;73 (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP220F3">3</xref>B). Both of these sites are located with PTEN's N-terminal phosphatase domain and interestingly the somatic-derived mutations that have altered PTEN nuclear localization occur within these regions.</p><fig id="DDP220F3" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;3.</label><caption><p>Consensus ATP-binding motifs in the N-terminal phosphatase domain of PTEN.

Exogenously expressed WTPTEN shows strong ATP binding in both the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions; while the cancer-derived PTEN mutants showed significantly reduced ATP binding in both compartments. Note that K62R- and K125E-PTEN mutants show little to no ATP binding in the nuclear fractions (no bands in nuclear fraction-eluate) although they show predominant nuclear localization (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP220F1">1</xref>).</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="ddp22004"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Carcinoma-associated <italic>PTEN</italic> mutations in the ATP-binding regions show reduced ATP binding</title><p>As alluded to above, the somatic <italic>PTEN</italic> mutations identified from primary sporadic colorectal tumors (K62R, Y65C and K125E) occur within PTEN's putative ATP-binding sites (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP220F3">3</xref>A and B). Therefore, we examined whether these mutant PTEN proteins could bind to ATP, utilizing the various overexpressing cell lines utilized in the growth assays described earlier.</p><p>Each of the MCF7 cell lines expressed the FLAG-tagged PTEN (WT and mutants) protein at similar levels (data not shown). We found that in all the cell lines, endogenous PTEN bound efficiently to ATP, as expected (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP220F4">4</xref>B). In contrast, we found that mutant PTEN protein did not bind to ATP as well as WTPTEN. There was less mutant PTEN detected in the ATP elute, when compared with the FLAG-tagged WTPTEN (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP220F4">4</xref>B). These mutations, however, did not completely abolish ATP binding. In order to examine this in more detail, we performed ATP-binding assays on both cytosolic and nuclear fractions from cell lines expressing the mutant PTEN proteins. Endogenous nuclear and cytosolic WTPTEN efficiently bound to ATP (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP220F4">4</xref>C). In addition, exogenously expressed nuclear and cytosolic FLAG-tagged WTPTEN bound to ATP (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP220F4">4</xref>C). However, all exogenously expressed mutant PTEN showed reduced ATP binding, with the K62R and K125E mutant PTEN nuclear proteins showing little to no nuclear ATP-binding capability (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP220F4">4</xref>C), despite the fact that these mutant proteins are predominately nuclear when compared with WTPTEN (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP220F1">1</xref>A and B). This may suggest that ATP binding is required for PTEN nuclear export.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Germline <italic>PTEN</italic> mutations located in the ATP-binding domains identified in CS patients</title><p>Our above data suggest that <italic>PTEN</italic> mutations located in the putative ATP-binding domains not only reduce the ability of PTEN to bind ATP, but also modulate PTEN protein in a detrimental manner. It stands to reason, then, that germline mutations in the ATP-binding sites may occur in patients with CS. Of the &#x0223c;400 classic CS patients, we found at least 4 CS patients with germline <italic>PTEN</italic> missense mutations that occur in the midst of these putative ATP-binding sites (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP220F3">3</xref>A and B). It should be noted, however, that missense mutations in CS are less common than truncating ones, but of &#x0223c;20 different germline missense mutations in <italic>PTEN</italic>, &#x0223c;14 lie in these two putative ATP-binding sites. Two patients had germline mutations in the Type-A binding site: R130G and R130Q. Additionally, two patients had germline mutations in the B-Type ATP-binding site: Y68H and Y68C. Each of these mutations are novel missense mutations, which are highly predicted to be deleterious, although this has not been confirmed functionally. Using patient-derived lymphoblastoid lines from the four CS probands, we examined the subcellular localization of PTEN in these patient samples. Lymphoblastoid cell lines from patients with putative ATP-binding site mutations demonstrated an increase in PTEN nuclear protein when compared with control lymphoblastoid lines (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP220F5">5</xref>). These CS patients consisted of three females and one male.

In our previous study, it was not readily apparent if ATP was modulating export or if there was an inhibitory phosphorylation event occurring. Our data here demonstrate that PTEN can bind ATP and somatic and germline-derived mutations in the ATP-binding sites result in PTEN being retained in the nuclear compartment, suggest that ATP is necessary for PTEN nuclear export.</p><p>In the ATP-binding domain of nucleophosmin/B23, the positively charged lysine residues, in particular lysine263, not only influences ATP-binding capabilities but also influences the subcellular localization of nucleophosmin/B23 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP220C24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP220C25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP220C29">29</xref>). This suggests that positively charged residues are important in ATP binding. The PTEN consensus ATP-binding domain, identified here, contains several positively charged residues, including lysine residues (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP220F3">3</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ddp220/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S1</ext-link>). Indeed, like nucleophosmin/B23, we found that naturally occurring germline and somatic mutations of these residues resulted in decreased ATP binding (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP220F4">4</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ddp220/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S2</ext-link>) and altered localization of PTEN compared with WT protein (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP220F5">5</xref>). Of importance, we found this in a variety of cell types (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ddp220/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S3</ext-link>). Our data suggest that not only the positively charged amino acid residues (lysine 62, lysine 125 and arginine 130), but also the polar uncharged residues (tyrosine 65 and tyrosine 68) in PTEN's consensus ATP-binding domain are important for ATP binding.</p><p>Independent of our study, Gil <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP220C7">7</xref>), and more recently, Denning <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP220C6">6</xref>), have demonstrated that the amino acid residues in the N-terminal phosphatase domain of PTEN can potentially behave either like nuclear exclusion or cytoplasmic retention motifs. Additionally, mutation of the hydrophobic tyrosine residues within the N-terminal region of PTEN (residues 1&#x02013;32) influence its nuclear localization in U87MG glioblastoma cells in a RanGTPase-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP220C7">7</xref>). However, a precise mechanism for this action was not fully elucidated. It is interesting to hypothesize, based on our data, that these regions contain specific charged residues that may be involved in ATP binding. Mutation of the lysine residue at amino acid 62 to arginine (K62R) leads to the introduction of an additional positive charge, which may require more energy for ATP to dissociate. This may explain the increased nuclear retention of the K62R-PTEN mutant in various cell lines tested (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP220F1">1</xref> and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ddp220/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S3</ext-link>). Similarly, the change at residue 65 and 68 from tyrosine to cysteine may provide for the opportunity of an additional disulphide (-SH) bond, which could require more energy for cellular traffic. In contrast, mutation of PTEN at amino acid residues 130 (R130G and R130Q) leads to a loss of a positive charge versus a gain. Clearly, the physical chemistry involved in these mutations and its affect on localization mechanisms requires further study.</p><p>Previous work, by others and us, has suggested that nuclear PTEN is required for proper cellular proliferation and growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP220C4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP220C8">8</xref>). More accurately, we believe that the balance of nuclear to cytoplasmic (WT) PTEN is important. Indeed, loss of nuclear WTPTEN has been correlated with unrestrained growth and tumor formation and progression. For example, when analyzing the subcellular localization of PTEN in melanoma, we found that 30/30 metastatic melanomas had loss of nuclear PTEN protein expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP220C11">11</xref>). This suggests that nuclear expression of WTPTEN is necessary for growth regulation and provides a protective effect in the cell, which has been supported in thyroid, breast and pancreatic islet models. Thus, it is interesting to note that in this study, mutations identified in colorectal cancer, alter PTEN: ATP binding and result in an increase in nuclear PTEN protein. This increase resulted in phenotypes, such as growth in soft agarose, which may be detrimental and not protective, as might have been expected. One hypothesis is that atypical increases in nuclear PTEN, which is also mutant, prevent normal cytosolic PTEN function. It is not unreasonable to consider the possibility that PTEN has unrecognized functions in the nucleus, as, until now, it was not known that PTEN could bind ATP. Our data indicate that proper regulation of PTEN: ATP binding is necessary for correct cellular growth. Whether this is simply due to alterations in nuclear transport or other signaling or protein:protein interactions remains to be determined. Undoubtedly, more remains to be elucidated regarding alternative PTEN functions, particularly those that require the binding of ATP. Nonetheless, PTEN regulation/function may not simply be a matter of localization, and while this may create a more confusing scenario it also provides other areas to target for novel therapeutics.</p><p>We have identified two putative ATP-binding sites in PTEN (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP220F3">3</xref>). These sites are in areas that are highly conserved among a variety of species (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ddp220/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S4</ext-link>), underlining the importance of these sites. Indeed, our data with sporadic- and germline-derived <italic>PTEN</italic> mutations strongly indicate that these mutations are pathologic. We found, that of four unrelated CS patients, that the three female patients all had breast cancer. While the sample size is small, overall functional, genetic and phenotypic data suggest that these mutations are pathogenic.</p><p>Taken together with our previous data, we demonstrate that PTEN binds ATP. The binding of PTEN to ATP not only controls nuclear localization, likely through the modulation of nuclear export, but also further regulates cellular functions such as abrogation of PTEN's tumor suppressor capabilities. This is supported not only by the somatic mutations identified in sporadic primary colorectal tumors, but also by the identification of four CS patients with germline ATP-binding domain missense mutations. In contrast, mutation of the bipartite NLS-like sequences which bind MVP do not result in alterations in phosphatase function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP220C21">21</xref>). Because naturally occurring <italic>PTEN</italic> missense mutations outside the ATP-binding motifs do not result in abrogation of ATP binding nor nuclear mislocalization (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ddp220/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S5 and S6</ext-link>), we believe that it may be both the presence of a mutation and the resulting nuclear mislocalization that are important. Whether it is any mutation in the ATP-binding motifs or whether it is the change in charge within the motifs that are important in nuclear mislocalization is not entirely known. Neutral mutations of our three somatic-associated ATP-binding motif mutations do result in some mislocalization to the nucleus (over WTPTEN), but slightly less so than the mutations which change the charge of those residues as well (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hmg.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/ddp220/DC1">Supplementary Material, Fig. S7</ext-link> versus Fig.&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="DDP220F1">1</xref>A). Thus, we may conclude that disruption of ATP binding is the major etiology for nuclear PTEN retention while charge plays a secondary role to determine the extent.</p><p>Initially, at a superficial level, our data may appear contradictory to previous observations that predominant nuclear expression of PTEN is seen in normal cells. However, it should be noted that normal cells have a predominance of nuclear PTEN and all of their PTEN is WT. WTPTEN in the nucleus signals down its protein phosphatase activity via cyclin D1 to downregulate MAPK signaling and elicit G1 cell cycle arrest and to stabilize the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP220C16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP220C19">19</xref>). Our current observations, therefore, suggest that mutant PTEN mislocalized in the nucleus prevents G1 arrest probably through upregulation of MAPK signaling and downregulation of cyclin D1. This hypothesis is corroborated by our cell cycle data presented here.</p><p>Missense mutations, as opposed to truncating mutations, are often conservatively interpreted as variants of unknown significance until proven otherwise. Thus, these observations should also aid in the genetic counseling of patients with germline <italic>PTEN</italic> missense mutations that lie anywhere in the ATP-binding domains. Together with the recent observation that germline variants in the genes encoding mitochondrial complex II subunits succinate dehyrogenase B and D (<italic>SDHB</italic>, <italic>SDHD</italic>) occur in <italic>PTEN</italic> mutation negative CS probands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP220C30">30</xref>), our data here add to the importance of energy and energy production in both heritable and sporadic neoplasias where the PTEN pathways are relevant. These observations should provide a novel pathway which involves manipulation of ATP and mitochondrial function in the treatment of both these heritable and sporadic malignancies.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Materials</title><p>Platinum <italic>Pfx</italic> polymerase, hygromycin, T4 DNA ligase, Prolong Gold anti-fade mounting medium and MAX efficiency <italic>DH5</italic>&#x003b1; competent cells were purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA).

While relative intensity in indirect immunofluorescence to the human eye appears more linear (it is not linear in reality), relative intensity of staining from immunofluorescence is non-linear and the human eye is only able to detect an intensity increase or decrease only after quite a large (non-linear) increase or decrease. Because of the histological view of cells (which is two-dimensional) with the very much smaller nuclear area compared with the cytoplasmic area, relative nuclear expression of any protein will be very exaggerated (i.e. look very strong) when compared with an equal amount of that protein in the cytoplasm (with its much larger surface area). Hence, visualization of relative intensities between a histological approach and western blot will appear different to the human eye. Because total protein content is very much higher in the cytoplasm over that from the nucleus, the very reason why a two-dimensional imaged cell (compared with western blot) shows intense nuclear staining is also the reason why cytoplasmic proteins which mainly reside in one compartment (in PTEN's case, the cytosol) will always appear more strongly expressed over that in the nucleus. In each cell line studied, the majority of PTEN is localized to the cytoplasm with a small, but distinct, portion present in the nucleus.</p></sec><sec id="s4k"><title>Subcellular fractionation, protein isolation and western blot analysis</title><p>Total, nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins were isolated at the indicated time-points as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP220C21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP220C23">23</xref>), using either the M-PER (total protein) or NE-PER (nuclear-cytoplasmic protein) extraction reagents according to the manufacturer's instructions (Pierce). Proteins obtained either from cell lines or cultured lymphocytes were fractionated on 10% SDS&#x02013;PAGE gels using either the BioRad Mini-gel or the Criterion system and transferred to nitrocellulose. Equal protein loading was confirmed by staining the nitrocellulose blots with Ponceau S and by western analysis with &#x003b1;-tubulin (cytosolic protein) or &#x003b1;-PARP-1 (nuclear protein). Blots were probed with &#x003b1;-PTEN, &#x003b1;-FLAG, &#x003b1;-Hsc70 and &#x003b1;-actin, each at a 1:1000 dilution, followed by incubation with the appropriate secondary antibody and visualized using enhanced chemiluminescence detection.</p></sec><sec id="s4l"><title>Colony-forming assay</title><p>To evaluate the transforming potential of the <italic>PTEN</italic> mutants, anchorage-independent growth was measured by soft agarose colony assay as previously described, but with minor modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP220C4">4</xref>). Briefly, the assay was performed in 60 mm dishes with a base of 2.5 ml of 2&#x000d7; DMEM medium containing 0.4% agarose and 5% FBS. Stably expressing, tetracyclin released (TetOff) WTPTEN and PTEN mutant expressing MCF7 cells were seeded, in duplicate, in 2 ml of 2&#x000d7; DMEM containing 5% FBS with 0.4% agarose at 2 &#x000d7; 10<sup>4</sup> cells/ml and layered onto the base. These embedded cells were then overlayed with 1 ml of 1&#x000d7; DMEM and 10% FBS. Culture dishes were incubated at 37&#x000b0;C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for approximately 2 weeks (overlayed media was replenished as required), and the diameter of the tumor colonies formed were determined using a microscope equipped with an ocular scale in the eyepiece. The average area of individual colonies were calculated (in pixels) using the ImagePro Plus software as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="DDP220C33">33</xref>). Approximately 100&#x02013;120 colonies were counted and sized.

After 24&#x02013;72 h days post-Tet release, cells were incubated in XTT solution for 4 h and reduction of the tetrazolium salt was quantified with an ELISA plate reader, as described by the manufacturer (Roche).

Fixed cells were washed with cold PBS, labeled with propidium iodide and analyzed by flow cytometry on a FACScan flow cytometer (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA). Cell cycle analysis was performed with the CELL-FIT program. All flow cytometric analyses were performed in triplicate. For the detection of apoptosis (by TUNEL), at the indicated times, cells were harvested by centrifugation after trypsinization, pelleted by centrifugation and washed with PBS. Cells were fixed in 1% PFA (prepared in PBS) for 15 min on ice. Fixed cells were then washed twice with PBS, resuspended in 500 &#x000b5;l cold PBS and fixed in 70% ice-cold ethanol. Samples were stored at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C until analysis. Flow cytometry was performed using a Beckman-Coulter elite flow cytometer using a 610 long pass filter for data collection.
