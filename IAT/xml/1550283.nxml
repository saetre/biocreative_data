We use microarray and genetic marker data from an F2 mouse intercross to examine the large-scale organization of the gene co-expression network in liver, and annotate several gene modules in terms of 22 physiological traits. We identify chromosomal loci (referred to as module quantitative trait loci, mQTL) that perturb the modules and describe a novel approach that integrates network properties with genetic marker information to model gene/trait relationships. Specifically, using the mQTL and the intramodular connectivity of a body weight&#x02013;related module, we describe which factors determine the relationship between gene expression profiles and weight. Our approach results in the identification of genetic targets that influence gene modules (pathways) that are related to the clinical phenotypes of interest.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="synopsis"><title>Synopsis</title><p>Obesity is a major pub lic health concern in many developed countries. While some people appear to stay lean no matter what or how much they eat, others appear to be genetically predisposed to obesity. The genetic similarity between mouse and human makes the mouse a promising mammalian model system to study obesity. Advantages of mouse models include the ability to control diet/environment and easy access to relevant tissues for gene expression studies. Mouse cross studies have implicated dozens of chromosomal regions that contain weight-predisposing genes, and gene expression studies have yielded hundreds of body weight&#x02013;related genes. In this study, the authors use a gene network&#x02013;based approach for integrating clinical traits, genetic marker data, and gene expression data. Instead of focusing on individual genes, the authors provide a systems-level view of a module of genes related to body weight. The resulting model allows them to characterize weight-related genes utilizing network concepts (intramodular connectivity) and genetic concepts (module quantitative trait locus). This integrative genomics approach provides new insights into the relationship between gene expression and body weight.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Ghazalpour A, Doss S, Zhang B, Wang S, Plaisier C, et al.

Briefly, the absolute value of the Pearson correlation coefficient is calculated for all pair-wise comparisons of gene expression values across all microarray samples. This correlation matrix is then transformed into a matrix of connection strengths using a power function (connection strength &#x0003d; &#x0007c;correlation&#x0007c;<sup>&#x000df;</sup>), resulting in a weighted network. The use of weighted networks represents an improvement over unweighted networks that are based on dichotomizing the correlation matrix, because (1) the continuous nature of the gene co-expression information is preserved and (2) the results of weighted network analyses are highly robust with respect to the choice of the parameter &#x000df;, whereas unweighted networks display sensitivity to the choice of the cutoff threshold &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020130-b027">27</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>We applied the network construction algorithm to a subset of gene expression data from an F2 intercross between inbred strains <italic>C3H/HeJ</italic> and <italic>C57BL/6J.</italic> Liver gene expression data from 135 female mice were used for this analysis (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>).

This should not lead to major information loss since module genes tend to be highly connected. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020130-g001">Figure 1</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020130-g001">1</xref>B, transcripts were clustered into distinct groups, herein referred to as modules. We were able to identify 12 distinct gene modules or groups of genes with high topological overlap (for details on module construction, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). To distinguish between modules, we designated each module by an arbitrary color. The number of genes included in the modules ranged from 34 (Light-yellow) to 772 (Red), and their mean overall connectivity (k<sub>all</sub>) ranged from 6.49 (Salmon) to 27.58 (Brown). We also defined the intramodular connectivity (k<sub>in</sub>) for each gene based on its Pearson correlation with all other genes in the module (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). Summary statistics for all gene modules are available in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020130-st001">Table S1</xref>. Detailed information about all genes and their network properties are available in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020130-sd001">Protocol S1</xref>.</p><p>Since we make use of the intramodular connectivity in the Blue module (534 genes), we studied its robustness with respect to dropping half of the microarrays used in its definition. Specifically, the following procedure was carried out 1,000 times. We randomly omitted half of the microarrays from the analysis when computing intramodular connectivity of the Blue module genes. Next, we correlated the resulting connectivity measures with the original full data intramodular connectivities. The median correlation between the full data connectivity and that of the 1,000 replicate subsets was 0.89 (interquartile range &#x0003d; &#x0005b;0.86,0.91&#x0005d;), which demonstrates that the intramodular connectivity measure is highly robust with respect to randomly omitting half of the microarrays.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Biological Significance of Network Modules</title><p>We examined the functional significance of the gene modules by testing for both enriched biochemical pathways and subcellular compartmentalization of proteins corresponding to genes within a gene module. First, we examined whether these modules were enriched for gene products in a specific subcellular compartment as defined by Gene Ontology (GO). Using the WebGestalt web site (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genereg.ornl.gov/webgestalt">http://genereg.ornl.gov/webgestalt</ext-link>) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020130-b029">29</xref>&#x0005d;, we calculated the enrichment of any specific GO cellular component in each module. All statistically significant observations are presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020130-sd002">Protocol S2</xref>. The results show that each module was enriched with distinct gene sets belonging to separate compartments within the cell. Interestingly, very few modules shared the same category. The &#x0201c;nucleus&#x0201d; category was enriched for both the Black and the Green-yellow (light green in color) modules. However, the nuclear genes for the Green-yellow module were genes involved in chromosomal maintenance, and for the Black module, they were genes involved in the regulation of transcription and DNA binding. Overall, these results are consistent with a model in which some gene modules correspond roughly to the spatial location of their products.</p><p>In order to gain further insight into the functional significance of the gene modules, we utilized the Expression Analysis Systemic Explorer (EASE) software package &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020130-b029">29</xref>&#x0005d; which can be used to conduct a pathway enrichment analysis for each module. EASE can be utilized to find enrichment of pathways annotated in the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). The EASE analysis for functional enrichment of modules found that seven modules are significantly enriched. The Brown module is enriched for genes within the Biosynthesis of steroids (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 2.3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;6</sup>) and Glycolysis/Gluconeogenesis&#x0201d; (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 1.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup>) pathways. These results are consistent with the finding that the Brown module is closely related to the plasma insulin levels (see below). The Blue module is enriched for genes in the ECM-receptor interaction (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 2.3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;9</sup>) and Complement and coagulation cascades (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 1.0 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;6</sup>) pathways. The Green module is enriched for the Toll-like receptor signaling (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 1.6 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;8</sup>), the Cytokine&#x02013;cytokine receptor interaction (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 2.9 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;7</sup>), and the Hematopoietic cell lineage (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 6.6 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup>) pathways. The Green-yellow module is enriched for genes involved in the Cell cycle pathway (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 6.3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;18</sup>). The Light-yellow module is enriched for genes involved in the MAPK signaling pathway (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 5.4 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup>). The Midnight-blue module is enriched for genes involved in the Nitrobenzene degradation pathway (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 7.1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup>). The Light-yellow module is enriched for genes involved in the Ribosome pathway (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 3.1 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup>). A detailed KEGG pathway analysis for each module can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020130-sd002">Protocol S2</xref>.</p><p>Next, we assessed the physiological relevance of each module by examining the overall correlation of the module genes with each of the phenotypes in F2 mice. In the BxH F2 cross, 22 physiological traits were measured for each animal. For a given physiological trait, we defined a measure of gene significance by forming the absolute value of the correlation between trait and gene expression values. For example, the body weight can be used to define a gene significance of the i<sup>th</sup> gene expression GSweight(i) &#x0003d; &#x0007c;cor(x(i), weight)&#x0007c; where x(i) is the gene expression profile of the i<sup>th</sup> gene. The mean gene significance for a particular module can be considered as a measure of module significance (MS) (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> for statistical test), which means that MS provides a measure for overall correlation between the trait and the module. For example, a module with a high MS value for &#x0201c;body weight&#x0201d; is on average composed of genes highly correlated with body weight. The two highest MS scores observed were for the Blue module with mouse weight (g) (MS &#x0003d; 0.395, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 7.7 &#x000d7; 10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup>), and the Brown module with plasma glucose-insulin ratio (MS &#x0003d; 0.336, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.004). In addition, the Blue module was also related to abdominal fat pad mass (g) (MS &#x0003d; 0.323, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.009), and total mass (g) of other fat depots (MS &#x0003d; 0.309, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.02; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020130-g002">Figure 2</xref>). The Brown module was also found to be significantly related to plasma insulin levels (mg/dl) (MS &#x0003d; 0.295, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.04). The results for the trait analyses for all modules with all traits are available in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020130-sg001">Figure S1</xref>. Since the Blue module was the most significantly related module to our clinical traits, our follow-up analysis focuses on this module.</p><p>It has been demonstrated in lower organisms that targeted attacks on genes with very high connectivity often result in lethal phenotypes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020130-b030">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020130-b033">33</xref>&#x0005d;. These results motivated us to study genes with high values of the intramodular connectivity measure (k<sub>in</sub>). As described in the previous section, the k<sub>in</sub> for each gene is based on its Pearson correlation with all the other genes in the module (Materials and Methods). To assess the significance of k<sub>in</sub>, we analyzed the Blue module, which showed the highest MS value in our previous analysis, and plotted k<sub>in</sub> against gene significance for all 534 genes in this module. The plot is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020130-sg002">Figure S2</xref>A (first panel). It is evident from this plot that there is a direct relationship between the connectivity of a gene and the extent to which it is related to the body weight (Spearman correlation &#x0003d; 0.41, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 10<sup>&#x02212;20</sup>). This analysis showed that the connectivity within a physiologically relevant module is directly related to the gene significance. General information for all Blue module hub genes is presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020130-st002">Table S2</xref>. We also measured gene expression levels and calculated the intramodular connectivity and gene significance for the Blue module genes in the brain, muscle, and adipose tissues in both male and female <italic>(C57BL/6JxC3H/HeJ)</italic> F2 mice. We find a moderate relationship between the connectivity and gene significance in male liver gene expression network (Spearman correlation 0.16 and <italic>p</italic> &#x0003d; 0.00028; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020130-sg002">Figure S2</xref>). In addition, our data suggest negligible relationships between connectivity and gene significance for other tissues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0020130-sg002">Figure S2</xref>). Since our data were not designed for detecting subgroup differences, the tissue-specific conclusion about relationship between connectivity and gene significance warrants further validation.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Genetic Analysis of the Network Modules</title><p>The above results regarding co-expression modules made use only of the gene expression data. In the following, we relate the module gene expressions to the genetic marker data to investigate the genetic underpinnings of the network modules. Recently, we and others have shown that there are genomic &#x0201c;hotspots&#x0201d; across the genome that regulate transcript levels of the genes &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020130-b003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020130-b014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020130-b018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020130-b026">26</xref>&#x0005d;. Since the co-expression network constructed here contained biologically relevant gene modules, we hypothesized that there might also be genomic hot spots that coordinately regulate the transcript levels of the genes within each module. Using 1,065 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers that were evenly spaced across the genome (~1.5 cM density), we mapped the gene expression values and plotted the distribution of the eQTL &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020130-b003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020130-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d; for all genes within each gene module. We defined a module quantitative trait locus (mQTL) as the locus with a significant enrichment for eQTL of the genes within a predetermined gene module. Since we were interested in studying the genetics of modules as opposed to the genetics of the entire network, when searching for mQTLs, we focused on module-specific eQTL hot spots&#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020130-b003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020130-b004">4</xref>&#x0005d;. Toward this end, we used the Fisher exact test to determine whether the proportion of module genes that map to the eQTL hotspot was significantly higher than that of the 8,000 network genes. The results for the Blue module are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020130-g003">Figure 3</xref>. We found that the Blue module has nine mQTLs.

To carry out this analysis, we defined two terms: GSweight and GSmQTL. As mentioned before, GSweight is defined as the absolute value of the correlation between gene expression profile and weight. GSmQTL is defined as a measure of gene significance for each of the SNPs underlying the mQTL. Using an additive marker coding (0,1,2) to code the three possible genotypes at each locus in the F2 mice, we defined the SNP gene significance measure of the i<sup>th</sup> gene expression x(i) by the absolute value of its correlation with the SNP under consideration.</p><disp-formula id="pgen-0020130-e001"><graphic xlink:href="pgen.0020130.e001.jpg" position="anchor" mimetype="image"/></disp-formula><p>This measure is highly correlated with the traditional LOD. We prefer this correlation based SNP significance measure over the LOD because (1) this definition is consistent with our co-expression measure between two gene expression profiles and with the definition of the body weight&#x02013;based gene significance measure, and (2) this definition measures the effect size of the SNP without regard to the sample size.</p><p>The mQTL-based significance measure for a particular SNP is designated &#x0201c;GSmQTL&#x0201d; followed by the chromosome number on which the corresponding SNP is located. For example, GSmQTL2 is the mQTL-based significance for the mQTL peak marker SNP on Chromosome 2. For simplicity, we make use of an additive marker coding, i.e., we assume an additive allelic effect. While there are situations when a dominant marker coding (AA&#x02192;1, AB&#x02192;1, and BB&#x02192;0) or a recessive marker coding (AA&#x02192;1, AB&#x02192;0, and BB&#x02192;0) is preferable, simulation studies have shown that, in general, the additive marker coding works well for a wide range of genetic models &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020130-b036">36</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>To assess the relationship between GSweight, k<sub>me</sub>, and GSmQTL we used a multivariate linear regression model. When we regressed GSweight on GSmQTL, we found that GSmQTL19 was positively correlated with GSweight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020130-g004">Figure 4</xref>) whereas GSmQTL2, GSmQTL5, and GSmQTL10a were all inversely correlated with GSweight.

By regressing GSweight on GSmQTL&#x0002a; and GSmQTL19, we found that 37&#x00025; of the variation in the GSweight could be explained by GSmQTL on Chromosomes 2, 5, 10, and 19 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0020130-t002">Table 2</xref>, model 1).

We find that model 3 provides a significantly better fit to the data than model 1 (F test <italic>p</italic>-value &#x0003c; 2.2e<sup>&#x02212;16</sup>). Similarly, model 3 provides a significantly better fit than model 2 (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 2.2e<sup>&#x02212;16</sup>). This analysis demonstrates that a model that integrates genetic information (SNP genotype) with network properties (intramodular connectivity) is a better predictor of the relationship between Blue module genes and weight.</p><p>To further explain the relationship between GSweight and the module variables, we visualized the distribution of GSweight in different strata using boxplots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020130-g004">Figure 4</xref>E). The eight different boxplots of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020130-g004">Figure 4</xref>E correspond to the eight groups of genes that resulted by splitting the Blue module genes by their median GSmQTL&#x0002a;, GSmQTL19, and k<sub>me</sub> values. We found that genes with high GSmQTL19, high connectivity, and low GSmQTL&#x0002a; had the highest GSweight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-0020130-g004">Figure 4</xref>E, labeled &#x0201c;q&#x02212; 19&#x0002b; k&#x0002b;&#x0201d;). This indicates that genes with strong linkage to the Chromosome 19 locus, absence of linkage to the SNPs described on Chromosomes 2, 5, and 10, and high connectivity have the highest absolute correlation with weight.

Modules, or groups of highly correlated genes, could be a result of transcriptional co-activation (gene activation or gene repression), or the co-regulation of mRNA stability, or a combination of these, resulting in a complex genetic network of closely related genes coordinately operating to accomplish a function or a group of related functions. It is important to note that the gene modules reported here are not the only existing modules; but rather they are those most perturbed in the F2 cross examined.

Here we show that integration of genetics and network analysis is a powerful approach to identify key regulatory loci controlling the co-expression network modules. We show that there exist several such mQTL across the genome. For the Blue module genes, we found an example of an mQTL on Chromosome 19 that coincided with the QTL of mouse weight. We hypothesize that the underlying gene or genes within such coinciding loci control the variation of both the trait and gene expression of the genes comprising the respective module. In contrast, loci that do not overlap with the trait QTL may represent novel loci that indirectly affect these traits through the underlying co-expression network.</p><p>Our unsupervised module detection method identifies a weight-related network module. In that module, genes with high intramodular connectivity tend to have a high absolute correlation with body weight (GSweight). Importantly, the availability of genetic marker data greatly enhances our understanding of the relationship between connectivity and GSweight. Two novel concepts enabled us to integrate the gene co-expression network analysis with the genetic analysis: the use of intramodular connectivity as a covariate characterizing a particular gene, and the use of the correlation of gene expression with SNP alleles at mQTL (GSmQTL) as a covariate to characterize a particular gene.</p><p>We found that the most significant predictor for the weight-based gene significance measure (GSweight) was the intramodular connectivity (k<sub>me</sub>). However, several of the mQTL-based gene significance measures (GSmQTL19, GSmQTL2, GSmQTL5, and GSmQTL10a) were highly significant independent predictors as well. The fact that the mQTL-based significance measures were independent of connectivity could also be seen from the weak correlations between k<sub>me</sub> and GSmQTL19 (<italic>r</italic> &#x0003d; 0.083), GSmQTL2 (<italic>r</italic> &#x0003d; 0.15), GSmQTL5 (<italic>r</italic> &#x0003d; &#x02212;0.071), and GSmQTL10 (<italic>r</italic> &#x0003d; 0.050).

Integrating gene co-expression networks with genetic marker information allows one to understand what factors influence the relationship between gene expression and weight.</p><p>In summary, we report the construction and characterization of a gene co-expression network in mice. We demonstrate the inherent modularity of the network and show that these gene modules have biologically meaningful functions, including significant correlations with physiological traits. In addition, we show that the highly connected hub genes of a module have higher gene significance relationships to the complex trait. We also demonstrate that these gene modules are largely coordinately regulated by a few key loci on the genome. Lastly, when we integrate the genetic information at these loci with the connectivity information from our network analysis, we are able to explain 70&#x00025; of the relationship between a gene and mouse weight. Our multivariate regression model represents a novel method for characterizing genes that are correlated with a complex trait, and highlights the importance of the systems biology approach to study complex traits.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Animal husbandry and physiological trait measurements.</title><p><italic>C57BL/6J apoE null (B6.apoE<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>)</italic> mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, Maine, United States) and <italic>C3H/HeJ apoE null (C3H.apoE<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>)</italic> mice were bred by backcrossing <italic>B6.apoE<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> to <italic>C3H/HeJ</italic> for ten generations with selection at each generation for the targeted <italic>ApoE<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> alleles on Chromosome 7.

The construction and comparison of the male network will be reported elsewhere. Only those mice with complete phenotype, genotype, and array data were used. This gave a final experimental sample of 135 female mice used for network construction. To reduce the computational burden and to possibly enhance the signal in our data, we used only the 8,000 most-varying female liver genes in our preliminary network construction. For module detection, we limited our analysis to the 3,600 most-connected genes because our module construction method and visualization tools cannot handle larger datasets at this point. By definition, module genes are highly connected with the genes of their module (i.e., module genes tend to have relatively high connectivity). Thus, for the purpose of module detection, restricting the analysis to the most-connected genes should not lead to major information loss. Since the network nodes in our analysis correspond to genes as opposed to probesets, we eliminated multiple probes with similar expression patterns for the same gene. Specifically, the 3,600 genes were examined, and where appropriate, gene isoforms and genes containing duplicate probes were excluded by using only those with the highest expression among the redundant transcripts.

The use of topological overlap thus serves as a filter to exclude very weak connections during network construction. Specifically the topological overlap between genes <italic>i</italic> and <italic>j</italic> is given by <disp-formula id="pgen-0020130-e002"><graphic xlink:href="pgen.0020130.e002.jpg" position="anchor" mimetype="image"/></disp-formula>where <inline-formula id="pgen-0020130-ex002"><inline-graphic xlink:href="pgen.0020130.ex002.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> denotes the number of nodes to which both <italic>i</italic> and <italic>j</italic> are connected, and <italic>u</italic> indexes the nodes of the network. The topological overlap matrix (TOM) is given by &#x003a9; &#x0003d; &#x0005b;&#x003c9;<sub>ij</sub>&#x0005d;. &#x003c9;<sub>ij</sub> is a number between 0 and 1 and is symmetric (i.e, &#x003c9;<sub>ij</sub> &#x0003d; &#x003c9;<sub>ji</sub>). Module identification was based on using the topological overlap matrix, &#x003a9; &#x0003d; &#x0005b;&#x003c9;<sub>ij</sub>&#x0005d; in conjunction with average linkage hierarchical clustering. Since hierarchical clustering takes a <italic>dis</italic>similarity measure as input, we defined a topological overlap&#x02013;based dissimilarity measure as follows: <inline-formula id="pgen-0020130-ex003"><inline-graphic xlink:href="pgen.0020130.ex003.jpg" mimetype="image"/></inline-formula> . Modules corresponded to branches of the resulting hierarchical clustering tree (dendrogram). We used a dynamic cut-tree algorithm for selection branches of the hierarchical clustering dendrogram (the details of the algorithm can be found at the following link: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genetics.ucla.edu/labs/horvath/binzhang/DynamicTreeCut">http://www.genetics.ucla.edu/labs/horvath/binzhang/DynamicTreeCut</ext-link>). The algorithm takes into account an essential feature of cluster occurrence and makes use of the internal structure in a dendrogram. Specifically, the algorithm is based on an adaptive process of cluster decomposition and combination, and the process is iterated until the number of clusters becomes stable. Although our network and module construction method has been used in other applications &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020130-b027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020130-b033">33</xref>&#x0005d;, no claim is made that our module construction method is optimal. The findings of a simulation study that show the efficacy of our module detection method can be found on our Web page: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genetics.ucla.edu/labs/horvath/CoexpressionNetwork/MouseWeight">http://www.genetics.ucla.edu/labs/horvath/CoexpressionNetwork/MouseWeight</ext-link>. </p><p>Each module represents a group of genes with similar expression profiles across the samples and the expression profile pattern is distinct from those of the other modules. In each case, the modules were then assessed for enrichment in ontology terms based on Fisher's exact test.</p></sec><sec id="s4g"><title>Statistical analysis of module significance measure and eQTL clustering.</title><p>To assign a <italic>p</italic>-value to the module significance measure, we made use of the Fisher transformation as implemented in the R function &#x0201c;cor.test&#x0201d;. Since the claims regarding the relationship between module genes and physiologic traits is fundamental to many subsequent analyses, we used the conservative Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons which entails multiplying the uncorrected <italic>p</italic>-value by the number of tests. A less-conservative alternative would be to estimate the false discovery rate, but care needs to be taken because the tests may be highly correlated.</p></sec><sec id="s4h"><title>Module connectivity and mQTL used in regression analysis.</title><p>For our multivariate regression analyses, we find it expedient to sum up the gene expression profiles of an entire module by one idealized gene expression profile. Toward this end we make use of the concept of a module eigengene. For a detailed theoretical discussion see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genetics.ucla.edu/labs/horvath/ModuleConformity">http://www.genetics.ucla.edu/labs/horvath/ModuleConformity</ext-link>.</p><p>Briefly, to compute the module eigengene, one decomposes the standardized gene expression profile of each module via the singular value decomposition (X &#x0003d; UDV<sup>T</sup>). The first column V<sub>1</sub> of V corresponds to the module eigengene. The singular value decomposition is closely related to principal component analysis, we denote V<sub>1</sub> by PC1 in the text. The module eigengene gives rise to a measure of module centrality (k<sub>me</sub>) as follows: k<sub>me</sub>(i) &#x0003d; &#x0007c;cor(x(i),PC1)&#x0007c;. We will refer to k<sub>me</sub> as module eigengene-based connectivity. The module eigengene-based connectivity measure (k<sub>me</sub>) is highly correlated (<italic>r</italic> &#x0003d; 0.86) with the standard intramodular connectivity measure (k<sub>in</sub>). k<sub>me</sub> was used only in our regression analysis because it is slightly more informative in our regression models. For all other applications, k<sub>in</sub> was utilized.</p><p>The SNPs used in the multivariate linear regression analysis were chosen based on two criteria: (1) They had to be peak markers at the Blue module mQTL, and (2) they had to be significant predictors of weight (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) in the linear model in which weight was regressed on all nine mQTL SNPs. These two criteria resulted in Chromosomes 2, 5, 10a, and 19 mQTL SNPs being included in the multivariate linear regression analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4i"><title>EASE Analysis.</title><p>The Expression Analysis Systemic Explorer (EASE) software &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020130-b029">29</xref>&#x0005d; was downloaded from the Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0020130-b051">51</xref>&#x0005d; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://david.niaid.nih.gov/david/ease.htm">http://david.niaid.nih.gov/david/ease.htm</ext-link>.
