The polyamine biosynthetic pathway has the distinction of being the target of the only clinically proven anti-trypanosomal drug with a known mechanism of action. Polyamines are essential for cell growth, and their metabolism is extensively regulated. However, trypanosomatids appear to lack the regulatory control mechanisms described in other eukaryotic cells. In <italic>T. brucei,</italic> S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase (AdoMetDC) and ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) are required for the synthesis of polyamines and also for the unique redox-cofactor trypanothione. Further, trypanosomatid AdoMetDC is activated by heterodimer formation with a catalytically dead homolog termed prozyme, found only in these species. To study polyamine regulation in <italic>T. brucei</italic>, we generated inducible AdoMetDC RNAi and prozyme conditional knockouts in the mammalian blood form stage. Depletion of either protein led to a reduction in spermidine and trypanothione and to parasite death, demonstrating that prozyme activation of AdoMetDC is essential. Under typical growth conditions, prozyme concentration is limiting in comparison to AdoMetDC. However, both prozyme and ODC protein levels were significantly increased relative to stable transcript levels by knockdown of AdoMetDC or its chemical inhibition. Changes in protein stability do not appear to account for the increased steady-state protein levels, as both enzymes are stable in the presence of cycloheximide. These observations suggest that prozyme and ODC are translationally regulated in response to perturbations in the pathway. In conclusion, we describe the first evidence for regulation of polyamine biosynthesis in <italic>T. brucei</italic> and we demonstrate that the unique regulatory subunit of AdoMetDC is a key component of this regulation. The data support ODC and AdoMetDC as the key control points in the pathway and the likely rate-limiting steps in polyamine biosynthesis.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) is an important vector-borne pathogen. The World Health Organization estimates that more than 50 million people are at risk for the disease, which occurs focally, in remote regions, and periodically reaches epidemic levels. Untreated HAT is always fatal, and the available drugs compromise toxicity and emerging resistance. The only safe treatment for late-stage disease is an inhibitor of an essential metabolic pathway that is involved in the synthesis of small organic cations termed polyamines. In this paper, we use genetic approaches to demonstrate how the parasite regulates this essential metabolic pathway. By modulating the protein levels of a trypanosome-specific activator of polyamine biosynthesis, the parasite has developed a mechanism to regulate pathway output. We also demonstrate that this pathway activator is essential to parasite growth. Our data strengthen the genetic and chemical validation of a key enzyme in this pathway as a drug target in the parasite, and they provide new insight into parasite-specific approaches that could be used to design novel drugs against this deadly disease.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Human African trypanosomiasis is a neglected disease of sub-Saharan Africa caused by the protozoan parasite <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic>.

AdoMetDC catalyzes the formation of decarboxylated S-adenosylmethionine required as the aminopropyl group donor in the formation of the longer chain polyamines.

As a consequence, polyamine pools in eukaryotic cells are tightly regulated, and cells carefully orchestrate a balance of polyamine biosynthesis, degradation and transport into and out of the cell. In mammalian cells, ODC and AdoMetDC are controlled by transcriptional, translational and post-translational mechanisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000183-Pegg1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000183-Pegg2">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000183-Pegg3">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>. Polyamine levels are also regulated by back converting enzymes and polyamine transport. ODC and AdoMetDC both have rapid intracellular turnover rates in mammalian cells.

Recently, we discovered that <italic>T. brucei</italic> AdoMetDC is activated 1,200-fold (on k<sub>cat</sub>) by dimerization with a catalytically dead paralog we termed prozyme <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000183-Willert1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref>. This mechanism for controlling AdoMetDC activity is unique to the trypanosomatid parasites, and the finding raised the possibility that regulation of prozyme expression could provide a parasite-specific mechanism to control polyamine homeostasis in trypanosomatids.</p><p>In order to study the potential for AdoMetDC or prozyme to function as regulators in polyamine biosynthesis we utilized RNA interference (RNAi) or regulated knockout approaches in blood form <italic>T. brucei</italic> parasites to deplete the cells of these proteins. Loss of AdoMetDC or prozyme leads to decreases in spermidine and trypanothione and to cell death. A large compensatory induction in the expression levels of prozyme and ODC was observed after either genetic depletion or chemical inhibition of AdoMetDC. Our data support a translational control mechanism for the regulation of these proteins and they provide the first demonstration that polyamine biosynthesis is regulated in <italic>T. brucei</italic>. Thus AdoMetDC and prozyme appear to play a central role in controlling polyamine homeostasis in the parasite through a mechanism that is not found in other eukaryotic cells. These data suggest that prozyme arose as a mechanism to regulate the polyamine metabolic flux in trypanosomes and they illustrate the multiplicity of regulatory control mechanisms that have evolved in this essential metabolic pathway.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>AdoMetDC is an essential enzyme in <italic>T. brucei</italic></title><p>To test the effects of reduced AdoMetDC expression on blood form <italic>T. brucei</italic> parasites, we generated a stable cell line with an inducible AdoMetDC targeted RNAi.

The studies herein demonstrate that AdoMetDC and prozyme are both essential for the growth of blood form <italic>T. brucei</italic>, and they provide the first evidence that the polyamine biosynthetic pathway is also regulated in <italic>T. brucei</italic>. Our data implicate both prozyme and trypanothione in regulation of polyamine homeostasis in <italic>T. brucei</italic>, suggesting that the evolution of these trypanosomatid-specific factors may have been linked to the need to acquire regulatory control mechanisms to modulate the growth effects of polyamines on the cell.</p><p>Few targets in the <italic>T. brucei</italic> parasite are validated both genetically and chemically, and the data presented here contribute to a compelling case that AdoMetDC is a promising drug target for the development of new treatments for African sleeping sickness. We have shown that prozyme is an essential activator of AdoMetDC activity and that the low activity of the AdoMetDC homodimer on its own is insufficient to maintain cell growth. Thus inhibitors that block heterodimerization, or lock the AdoMetDC structure into an inactive confirmation would provide a parasite-specific mechanism to inhibit this essential enzyme. Successful strategies for these approaches have recently been described, e.g. for Abl kinase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000183-Noble1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref> and the Bcl-X/BAK interaction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000183-Wells1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. The AdoMetDC knockdown by RNAi led to an 70&#x02013;80&#x00025; reduction in AdoMetDC protein that was sufficient to cause cell death, suggesting that a small molecule inhibitor of AdoMetDC would not need to fully inhibit AdoMetDC to be effective. A postulated mechanism for selective toxicity of ODC inhibitors is differential rates of intracellular protein turnover between the rapidly degraded mammalian ODC and the stable trypanosome enzyme <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000183-Phillips1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. We find that <italic>T. brucei</italic> AdoMetDC is also a stable protein, while like ODC mammalian AdoMetDC has a short intracellular half-life <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000183-Pegg4">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus differential enzyme turnover may also contribute to selective toxicity of AdoMetDC inhibitors in <italic>T. brucei</italic>. Finally, the AdoMetDC suicide inhibitor MDL 73811 is a potent anti-trypanosomal agent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000183-Bacchi1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000183-Bitonti1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>. Our finding that prozyme levels are induced by MDL 73811 provides strong evidence supporting AdoMetDC inhibition as the mechanism of action of MDL 73811 in <italic>T. brucei</italic>, strengthening the chemical validation of the target.</p><p>It appears that <italic>T. brucei</italic> regulates the polyamine pathway flux to maintain spermidine homeostasis while depleting the conjugated thiol pools. Indeed spermidine levels do not fall below 40&#x00025; of the control levels after induction of AdoMetDC RNAi, and they are only fully depleted in the prozyme cKO, which generated a more complete knockdown of AdoMetDC activity. Addition of exogenous spermidine to the prozyme cKO line partially restored the spermidine pools, but not the GSH-Spd and trypanothione pools, suggesting that the cell does not build up the GSH-Spd and trypanothione pools until spermidine levels reach an appropriate steady-state set point. In support, eflornithine treatment has been reported to cause only a partial depletion of spermidine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000183-Bacchi2">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000183-Fairlamb1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. These data further provide evidence that the loss of trypanothione pools is a central factor in cell death for both the AdoMetDC knockdown cells and during eflornithine treatment. TrypSyn contains both a synthetic domain catalyzing the formation of GSH-Spd and trypanothione, as well as a catabolic domain that is able to degrade both conjugates back to free spermidine and GSH <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000183-Fyfe1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. The function of the catabolic domain has not been demonstrated <italic>in vivo</italic>, however our data supports the idea that trypanothione serves as a cellular reservoir for spermidine and that its catabolism contributes to spermidine homeostasis in the cell. This mechanism would provide an analogous situation to that observed in mammalian cells where catabolism of spermine and spermidine play crucial roles in regulating pathway flux <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000183-Wang1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The finding that spermidine was able to rescue the cell growth defect caused by the AdoMetDC RNAi knockdown, but not the prozyme cKO is not entirely understood. Underlying this observation is the finding that exogenous spermidine restored the spermidine and trypanothione pools to the AdoMetDC RNAi cells but not the prozyme cKO cells. We did not observe any difference in spermidine uptake between these lines (unpublished observation) but did find as has been previously published that spermidine is poorly taken up by <italic>T. brucei</italic> blood form parasites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000183-Taylor1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. The prozyme cKO led to a 30&#x00025; greater reduction in AdoMetDC activity than the AdoMetDC RNAi knockdown, and this correlates with a more rapid and complete depletion of spermidine and trypanothione and to more rapid cell growth arrest. This data, in combination with the spermidine pool analysis, suggests that spermidine incorporation is only sufficient to restore GSH-Spd and trypanothione pools after AdoMetDC RNAi, where more residual AdoMetDC remains to help bolster the spermidine pools than is observed in the prozyme cKO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000183-g004">Figure 4</xref>). A further caveat is the observation that spermidine is able to rescue the AdoMetDC RNAi lines when added up to day 4 after Tet induction, while it can not rescue these lines if added as late as day 6. This corresponds to the point in the growth curve where the GSH-Spd and trypanothione pools have become completely depleted, suggesting that the cells have undergone an irreversible event in the absence of these pools that commits them to death. For the prozyme cKO line, even at the earliest time point measured (day 2), the GSH-Spd and trypanothione pools were completely depleted, so it may be that the prozyme cKO cells undergo the irreversible transition too quickly for spermidine rescue to be effective.</p><p><italic>T. brucei</italic> responds to loss of spermidine by upregulating two key proteins required for spermidine production, ODC and prozyme. Either the genetic knockdown of AdoMetDC or its chemical inhibition by MDL 73811 led to a rapid and robust increase in prozyme and ODC protein levels. Spermidine rescue of the AdoMetDC RNAi line fully restored normal cell growth, yet the induction of the prozyme and ODC proteins still occurred, providing strong evidence that the induction was not linked to non-specific cell growth effects. The fact that either genetic or chemical loss of AdoMetDC activity leads to increased protein levels of ODC and prozyme provides cross-validation for the observation and demonstrates that the effects do not result from some peculiarity of the genetic system. In wild-type cells prozyme is present in limiting concentration in comparison to AdoMetDC. Thus prozyme is positioned to function not only as an essential activator of AdoMetDC, but by dynamically altering its levels the cell has a mechanism to modulate spermidine production depending on its metabolic state. The pyruvoyl-dependant mechanism of AdoMet decarboxylation is inherently prone to enzyme inactivation through abortive deamination, which occurs at a significant frequency during the catalytic cycle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000183-Anton1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>. Mammalian cells may utilize rapid turnover of AdoMetDC as a mechanism to replace the damaged enzyme. Perhaps in the trypanosomatids, where AdoMetDC is a stable protein, the ability to rapidly upregulate the allosteric activator, prozyme, provides an alternative mechanism to evade substrate-mediated inactivation of AdoMetDC by allowing the AdoMetDC pools to remain inactive until needed.</p><p>The expression of prozyme and ODC both appear to be under translational control. First the protein levels of prozyme and ODC increased substantially upon loss of AdoMetDC activity, while the mRNA levels were not significantly affected. Thus the increased protein accumulation results from either increased translational or from post-translational changes in protein stability. Secondly, prozyme, ODC and AdoMetDC were stable over the 6 h incubation with cycloheximide demonstrating that changes in protein turnover are unlikely to contribute to the increase in steady-state protein levels. The control of gene expression in <italic>T. brucei</italic> is unusual in comparison to other eukaryotic cells. In <italic>T. brucei</italic> mRNAs are transcribed as polycistronic units and polymerase II gene transcription is not regulated at the level of transcription initiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000183-Clayton1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>.

The finding that polyamine biosynthesis in <italic>T. brucei</italic> is likely to be translationally regulated shows that translational control in <italic>T. brucei</italic> is not limited to developmental regulation but also functions as a mechanism to regulate house-keeping enzymes involved in primary metabolism during the cell cycle.</p><p>An open question is what triggers the de-repression of ODC and prozyme protein expression in response to loss of AdoMetDC. Protein levels are increased by either knockdown or inhibition of AdoMetDC, thus loss of AdoMetDC activity appears to be the common element in triggering the response. The precedent in other eukaryotic cells is that changes in spermidine levels affect the ribosome and thus influence translation. Expression of the ODC inhibitor antizyme is controlled by ribosomal frame-shifting which is stimulated by spermidine, or by putrescine at higher concentrations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000183-Matsufuji1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000183-Rom1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. Translation of AdoMetDC in mammalian cells and plants is regulated by a ribosome-stalling peptide that traps the ribosome so that AdoMetDC mRNA is translated efficiently only at low spermidine concentration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000183-Hanfrey1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000183-Law1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. In <italic>T. brucei</italic> there are no apparent upstream open reading frames in prozyme or ODC, and changes in spermidine concentration appear unlikely to trigger the observed translational changes, since protein levels were induced even in the spermidine rescued AdoMetDC RNAi knockdown cells. The elevated putrescine levels (6&#x02013;10-fold) observed in the metabolite profiles for cells that express higher levels of prozyme and ODC is a potentially significant observation, but it seems an unlikely trigger for an increase in ODC expression. Human and malaria dihydrofolate reductase have been shown to bind their mRNA to regulate translation of the message <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000183-ErcikanAbali1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000183-Zhang1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. For the human enzyme binding to mRNA is prevented by the enzyme inhibitor methotrexate. This suggests an intriguing hypothesis that is consistent with our data. AdoMetDC may bind to both the prozyme and ODC mRNA and thereby inhibit their translation.</p><p>The regulated expression of prozyme is a unique mechanism for controlling polyamine pathway flux in <italic>T. brucei</italic> not found in other eukaryotic cells. However, despite differences in the protein components the metabolic control points of the pathway in <italic>T. brucei</italic> are similar to those found in mammalian cells, with regulation being focused on control of ODC and AdoMetDC. Thus the data suggests that similarly to mammalian cells, ODC and AdoMetDC catalyze the rate-limiting steps in polyamine biosynthesis in <italic>T. brucei</italic>. While the mechanisms differ, both utilize translational regulation of regulatory proteins to control the pathway flux. Mammalian cells translationally regulate an ODC inhibitor protein, antizyme, while <italic>T. brucei</italic> regulates an AdoMetDC activator protein, prozyme. Thus <italic>T. brucei</italic> has evolved a unique but parallel regulatory mechanism to control polyamine metabolism to that found in mammalian cells. These data provide evidence for convergent evolution of translational control mechanisms centered on regulatory binding proteins in the polyamine metabolic pathway.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Trypanosome culture</title><p>Bloodstream form trypanosomes (90-13 or 427) were cultured in HMI-9 media supplemented with 10&#x00025; serum at 37&#x000b0;C, 5&#x00025; CO<sub>2</sub> as described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000183-Hirumi1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>.
