Of the three isoforms expressed in mammals, SV2B is the most divergent. Here we report studies of SV2B location and function in the retina. Immunolabeling studies revealed that SV2B is detected in rod photoreceptor synaptic terminals where it is the primary isoform. In mice lacking SV2B, synaptic transmission at the synapse between photoreceptors and bipolar neurons was decreased, as evidenced by a significant reduction in the amplitude of the b-wave in electroretinogram recordings. Quantitative immunoblot analyses of whole eyes revealed that loss of SV2B was associated with reduced levels of synaptic vesicle proteins including synaptotagmin, VAMP, synaptophysin and the vesicular glutamate transporter V-GLUT1. Immunolabeling studies revealed that SV2B is detected in rod photoreceptor synaptic terminals where it is the primary isoform. Thus, SV2B contributes to the modulation of synaptic vesicle exocytosis and plays a significant role in regulating synaptic protein content.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The secretion of neurotransmitter can be distinguished from other forms of exocytosis by its strict dependence on calcium, speed, and plasticity. These specialized features are conferred by proteins unique to regulated secretion, including some isoforms of synaptotagmin, complexin, cytomatrix proteins (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005230-Chapman1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005230-Rosenmund1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>), and Synaptic Vesicle Protein 2 (SV2). All of these proteins are members of multi-gene families with isoforms that are co-expressed to varying degrees in different neuronal cells. Differences in isoform action, expression, and localization are hypothesized to contribute to differences in neuronal and endocrine cell functioning.</p><p>SV2 is a gene family that consists of three highly related membrane glycoproteins in mammals (SV2A, SV2B, SV2C) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005230-Bajjalieh1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005230-Feany1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005230-Bajjalieh2">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005230-Janz1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Of the three isoforms, SV2B is the most divergent.

Together these observations support the idea that SV2B may function differently in the synapse than other SV2 isoforms. On the other hand, loss of SV2B does not appear to affect neurotransmission in neurons that also express SV2A, which is consistent with the two isoforms performing an identical function, or SV2B performing only a subset of functions performed by SV2A <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005230-Custer1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005230-Janz2">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>To identify the role of SV2B at the synapse, we examined the effects of SV2B gene disruption on neurotransmission in retina, thereby taking advantage of the reported absence of SV2A in ribbon synapses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Antibodies</title><p>Anti-Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, (GAPDH) mAb was from CalbioChem.

To quantify changes in synaptic vesicle protein expression, we compared the levels of synaptotagmin and other synaptic vesicle proteins in eyes of SV2B wild-type and knockout mice by quantitative Western analysis. Eyes from multiple mice of each genotype were pooled and homogenates probed with antibodies directed against the synaptic vesicle proteins SV2 (total), SV2A, SV2B, synaptotagmin, synaptophysin, the vesicular glutamate transporter V-glut1, and VAMP. The amount of protein loaded was adjusted for each antibody so that signal intensity fell within the linear range of the assay (Supplemental <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0005230.s002">Figure S2</xref>). Samples from each genotype were run multiple times in each blot to control for variability. The average value for SV2B&#x02212;/&#x02212; eyes was expressed as the percent of the average value for SV2B&#x0002b;/&#x0002b; eyes from the same blot. These analyses revealed decreased levels of synaptotagmin, synaptophysin, V-Glut-1, and VAMP in eyes from SV2B&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0005230-t002"><bold>Table 2</bold></xref>). Levels of SV2A and GAPDH (which is found on synaptic vesicles but is also present in all cells of the eye) did not change with the loss of SV2B. Since the retina is the major site of synapses in the eye, these data indicate that multiple synaptic vesicle proteins are reduced in retinal synapses in the absence of SV2B. While the reduction in protein expression we observed may seem large given the localized expression of SV2B in the retina, we note that photoreceptor synaptic terminals contain hundreds of thousands of synaptic vesicles per synapse. This contrasts with the tens to hundreds of vesicles in the synapses of the inner retina. It is therefore likely that, although there are many more synapses in the inner retina, the pool of photoreceptor synaptic vesicles represents the majority of retinal synaptic vesicles.</p><table-wrap id="pone-0005230-t002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0005230.t002</object-id><label>Table 2</label><caption><title>Loss of SV2B decreases the expression of several synaptic vesicle proteins.</title></caption><graphic id="pone-0005230-t002-2" xlink:href="pone.0005230.t002"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" alternate-form-of="pone-0005230-t002-2"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Protein</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x00025; wild-type</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">SV2B</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.3 &#x0002b;/&#x02212;0</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">SV2A</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">98 &#x0002b;/&#x02212; 5</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">SV2 (total)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">57 &#x0002b;/&#x02212; 13</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Synaptotagmin (mAb)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">61 &#x0002b;/&#x02212; 4</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Synaptotagmin (pAb)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">44 &#x0002b;/&#x02212; 8</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Synaptophysin</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">55 &#x0002b;/&#x02212; 5</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">VAMP2</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">71 &#x0002b;/&#x02212; 5</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">V-glut1</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">66 &#x0002b;/&#x02212; 4</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">GAPDH</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">102 &#x0002b;/&#x02212;7</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="nt102"><p>Eyes from two SV2B&#x0002b;/&#x0002b; and two age-matched SV2B&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice were pooled and extracted after which equal amounts of protein processed for quantitative Western analysis as described under <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2"><italic>Methods</italic></xref>.

To assess the location of the changes in protein expression, we probed retina sections with antibodies to multiple synaptic proteins. Immunolabeling with antibodies that recognize synaptotagmin 1 and 2 revealed a reduction, though not a complete absence, of synaptotagmin labeling in the outer plexiform layer of SV2B&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice, particularly in rod terminals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005230-g004"><bold>Figure 4</bold></xref>). This is in agreement with the findings of Lazzell et al (D. R. Lazzell et al., 2004) and is consistent with the interpretation that SV2B plays a crucial role in synaptotagmin trafficking or stability in rod photoreceptor synapses. We also saw a slight reduction in VGLUT1 labeling of putative rod bipolar cell terminals in the inner IPL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0005230-g004">Fig. 4A</xref>), whereas there was no apparent decrease in other synaptic proteins including synaptophysin, synaptic ribbons (ribeye) and the presynaptic calcium channel proteins, Cav1.4 and &#x003b2;2 subunits (data not shown). This may be due to the non-quantitative nature of the immunolabeling approach, or to a generalized reduction of other synaptic proteins in the absence of SV2B. What our immunolabeling studies do show is that the decrease of synaptotagmin expression in the retina of mice lacking SV2B is limited to rod photoreceptor terminals in the OPL.</p><fig id="pone-0005230-g004" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0005230.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Distribution of synaptic vesicle proteins in SV2B knockout (&#x02212;/&#x02212;) and wild-type (&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;) retina.</title><p>A) Synaptotagmin labeling is markedly reduced in the OPL of the &#x02212;/&#x02212; retina.

The decrease is unlikely to be due to effects on synapse formation, as the gross morphology of synapses was normal.

Our results demonstrate that, like SV2A, SV2B acts as a positive modulator of neurotransmission, consistent with the conclusion that all SV2 proteins perform a similar function in regulating presynaptic exocytosis. Thus SV2B is likely to represent a target for therapeutic intervention analogous to SV2A, which is the target of the anti-epileptic drug levetiracetam <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005230-Lynch1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>We also found that loss of SV2B alters synaptic protein expression in the eye.

While we confirmed the effect on synaptotagmin, quantitative Western analyses to revealed that loss of SV2B also affects the levels of synaptophysin, VAMP and V-GLUT1. Thus SV2B has a broader effect on the levels of synaptic vesicle protein expression than was previously demonstrated. In a series of (non-quantative) anti-synaptophysin immunoblots we observed that samples from SV2B&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice showed a reduction in bands that migrated at the molecular weight of VAMP-synaptophysin complexes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005230-Calakos1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005230-Galli1">&#x0005b;30&#x0005d;</xref> (data not shown). This suggests that loss of SV2 may affect the ability of VAMP to form protein complexes, an interpretation consistent with the finding that loss of the SV2A gene results in a reduction in assembled (SDS-resistant) SNARE complexes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005230-Xu1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The presence of SV2A in rod photoreceptor presynaptic terminals, coupled with the observation that the decrease in synaptotagmin labeling in the OPL of SV2B&#x02212;/&#x02212; mice correlates well with the decrease in total SV2 immunolabeling suggests that the remaining synaptotagmin is being stabilized by SV2A. Thus it is likely that all SV2 isoforms contribute to synaptic vesicle protein composition. Our finding, that loss of SV2B affects the levels of multiple synaptic proteins, is consistent with a role for SV2 in endocytosis. SV2s contain one or more tyrosine-based endocytosis motifs that can affect the ability of the clathrin adaptor protein AP2 to bind to synaptic membranes, in part by affecting AP2 binding to synaptotagmin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005230-Haucke1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, SV2 could influence the trafficking of proteins to synaptic vesicles by regulating clathrin-mediated endocytosis of vesicle proteins. Alternatively, SV2 might regulate the trafficking of vesicle membrane proteins from the ER/Golgi. We note with interest that the transporter-like protein, unc93b, is essential for proper trafficking of a subset of Toll receptors, which are type 1 membrane proteins like several synaptic vesicle proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005230-Brinkmann1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0005230-Kim1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>. In this regard, SV2 might affect the conformation and stability of vesicle membrane proteins by directly interacting with them and affecting their trafficking or folding.</p><p>If SV2 plays a major role in vesicle assembly, the neurotransmission deficit we observed could result entirely from altered vesicle protein composition or decreased vesicle formation.
