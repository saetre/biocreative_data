P-TEFb complex has been shown to associate with and phosphorylate the carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA pol II, thereby enhancing elongation of transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Tat protein binds an uracil containing bulge within the stem-loop secondary structure of the Tat-activated region (TAR-RNA) in HIV-1 transcripts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Tat functions as an elongation factor and stabilizes the synthesis of full-length viral mRNAs by preventing premature termination by the TAR-RNA stem-loop. Physical and functional interactions between Tat and P-TEFb have been well documented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Tat binds to P-TEFb by direct interaction with the human cyclinT1, and the critical residues required for interaction have been delineated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The current model for recruitment of P-TEFb to the LTR, predicts the formation of the Tat-P-TEFb complex, which efficiently binds TAR, allowing CDK9 to phosphorylate the CTD of RNAPII, thereby, enhances processivity of the polymerase to produce full-length mRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>Like other CDKs, the P-TEFb activity is regulated by a dedicated inhibitor. Two different P-TEFb complexes exist in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The active complex is composed of two subunits, the CDK9 and its regulatory partners cyclinT1 or T2. In addition, a larger inactive complex has been identified, which comprises of four subunits, CDK9, cyclinT1 or T2, the abundant small nuclear RNA 7SK and the HEXIM1 protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. It has been recently shown that HEXIM1 has the inherent ability to associate with cyclin T1 and binding of 7SK snRNA turns the HEXIM1 into a P-TEFb inhibitor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The relative presence of core and inactive P-TEFb complexes changes rapidly in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Several stress-inducing agents trigger dissociation of the inactive P-TEFb complex and subsequent accumulation of kinase active P-TEFb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Thus, the 7SK-HEXIM1 ribonucleic complex represents a new type of CDK inhibitor that contributes to regulation of gene transcription. A further level of complexity of this system comes from the recent identification of HEXIM2, a HEXIM1 paralog, which regulates P-TEFb similarly as HEXIM1 through association with 7SK RNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>It has been showed that Tat binds exclusively to the active P-TEFb complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Thus the presence of HEXIM1/7SK snRNA in P-TEFb complexes prevents Tat binding. Since the association between 7SK RNA/HEXIM1 and P-TEFb appears to compete with binding of Tat to cyclinT1, we have speculated that the TAR RNA/Tat system may compete with the cellular 7SK snRNA/HEXIM1 system in the recruitment of the active P-TEFb complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Accordingly, it has been shown that over-expression of HEXIM1 represses Tat function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>].</p><p>We show here that HEXIM1, or its paralog HEXIM2, inhibits Tat trans-activation of HIV-LTR driven gene expression, and more importantly, we demonstrated the role of the 7SK snRNA recognition motif as well as the binding to cyclin T1 as crucial elements for efficient Tat inhibition.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Tat activity is inhibited by HEXIM1</title><p>Tat activity involves direct interaction with CDK9/CyclinT1 (P-TEFb) complex. However, two major P-TEFb-containing complexes exits in human cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. One is active and restricted to CDK9 and cyclin T, the other is inactive and it contains HEXIM1 or 2 and 7SK snRNA in addition to P-TEFb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. We have previously shown that Tat interacts only with the active P-TEFb complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Because the two complexes are in rapid exchange, we sought to determine the functional consequences of the over-expression of HEXIM1 and 7SK snRNA on HIV-1 LTR-driven gene transcription. To this end we performed transient transfections in human 293 cells using the HIV-LTR-Luc reporter in the presence of increasing amounts of Flag-taggeted HEXIM1 and 7SK snRNA, respectively. Dose-dependent expression of F:HEXIM1 was monitored by immunoblotting with anti-HEXIM1 antibody (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref> panel A). As presented in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>, we found that basal transcription from the LTR sequences was unaffected by the presence of F:HEXIM1 or 7SK RNA. In contrast, Tat-mediated transactivation of the HIV-1 LTR was inhibited by the over-expression of F:HEXIM1 in a dose-dependent manner. Ectopic expression of 7SK RNA did not significantly affected HIV-LTR-Luc expression either alone or in combination with F:HEXIM1. Thus, it appears that HEXIM1 is able to repress Tat-mediated activation. To further substantiate the inhibitory function of HEXIM1 we sought to extend our analysis using the murine CHO cells. Tat protein is a potent activator of HIV-1 LTR transcription in primate cells but only poorly functional in rodent cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. However, Tat-mediated activation can be rescued by enforced expression of human cyclin T1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. As presented in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref> we found that, while hCycT1 rescued Tat function, ectopic expression of HEXIM1 effectively inhibits Tat activity. Most importantly, Tat enhancement mediated by hCycT1 was effectively abrogated by co-expression of HEXIM1 in a dose-dependent manner. Finally, like in human cells, ectopic expression of 7SK snRNA did not have any significant effect on Tat activity.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Overexpression of HEXIM1 protein represses Tat transactivation. Panel A, Increasing amounts (10, 100 and 500 ng) of Flag-taggeted HEXIM1 were transfected into 293, cellular extracts were prepared at 48 hr after transfection and the relative levels on endogenous and exogenous HEXIM1 proteins were visualized by immunoblotting with anti-HEXIM1 antibody. Panel B, the HIV-Luc reporter (50 ng) was transfected into 293 cells in the presence of pSV-tat (50 ng) along with increasing (10, 100 and 500 ng) amounts of F:HEXIM1 and 7SK RNA (10, 100 and 500 ng), as indicated. Panel C, HEXIM1 decreases the co-operative effect of CycT1 on Tat activation in rodent cells. Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO) were transfected with the HIV-LTR-Luc reporter (50 ng) in the presence of pSV-Tat (100 ng), lane 1, and together with CMV-hCycT1 (200 ng), lane 2, in the presence of increasing amounts of F:HEXIM1 and 7SK RNA as in panel B.

A large number of evidences indicate that Tat-transactivation is mainly due to the recruitment of the cellular complex P-TEFb to the LTR, causing phosphorylation of the RNAPII CTD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Accordingly, we and others have previously showed that artificial recruitment of P-TEFb to the HIV-1 promoter is sufficient to activate the HIV-1 promoter in the absence of Tat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. We sought to determine the consequences of ectopically expressed F:HEXIM1 on P-TEFb induced transcription in the absence of Tat. We showed that direct recruitment of CyclinT1 to a promoter template by fusion to the GAL4 DNA binding domain, activates transcription from an HIV-1 LTR (G5HIV-Luc) reporter bearing GAL4 sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Human 293 cells were transfected with the G5HIV-Luc reporter along with GAL4-fusion expression vectors in the presence of F:HEXIM1. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>, we found that GAL4-CycT1 effectively activates transcription from the HIV-1 LTR reporter, and co-expression of F:HEXIM1 resulted in a robust dose-dependent inhibition. The specific effect of HEXIM1 expression was highlighted by the results shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>. G5HIV-Luc reporter was activated by co-expression of a GAL4-TBP, and such activation was largely unaffected by co-expression of HEXIM1. Thus, it appears that while HEXIM1 represses P-TEFb activity, enforced expression of this protein does not have significant effects on TBP-mediated basal transcription.</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>HEXIM1 represses GAL4-CycT1-mediated activation.

The presence of the cotransfected F:HEXIM1 (10, 100 and 500 ng) is indicated.

We found that removal of the C-terminal amino acids affected the inhibition as shown by the HEXIM1 (1&#x02013;300) and (1&#x02013;240) mutants (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> lanes 6&#x02013;8 and 9&#x02013;11). In contrast, removal of the 119 N-terminal amino acids of HEXIM1 (120&#x02013;359) did not abolished inhibition (lanes 12&#x02013;14). However, further deletion of the N-terminal amino acids (181&#x02013;359) completely abolished the inhibitory effect (lanes 15&#x02013;17). Thus, HEXIM1-mediated repression required the presence of the C-terminal domain (300&#x02013;359aa) as well as a central region between residues 120 and 181. Finally, we found that HEXIM2, which like HEXIM1, associates and inhibits P-TEFb activity, represses Gal4-CycT1 activation in a dose dependent manner (lanes 18&#x02013;20).</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>HEXIM1 regulatory domains involved in repression. Human 293 cells were transfected with 50 ng of G5-HIV Luc reporter DNA alone (lane 1) or in the presence of 50 ng of pSV-Tat (lanes 2&#x02013;20). The presence of increasing amounts (10, 100 and 500 ng) F:HEXIM1 wild-type (lanes 3&#x02013;5), various deletion mutants (lanes 6&#x02013;17) and F:HEXIM2 wt(18&#x02013;20) are indicated, respectively.

This experiment was performed three times with similar results.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1742-4690-2-42-3"/></fig><p>We have recently reported that the HEXIM1 C-terminal domain (181&#x02013;359) is involved in the binding to P-TEFb through direct interaction with the cyclin-box of cyclinT1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], and the evolutionarily conserved motif (PYNT aa 202&#x02013;205) is important for such interaction. The PYND point mutant is impaired in repression and binding either P-TEFb or 7SK RNA in vivo, albeit it retains the ability to bind 7SK in vitro. In addition, we determined that HEXIM1 binds 7SK snRNA directly and the RNA-recognition motif (KHRR) was identified in the central region of the protein (aa 152&#x02013;155). In fact, the HEXIM1-ILAA mutant fails to interact in vivo and in vitro with 7SK snRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. To test the importance of these motifs in HEXIM1-mediated repression of Tat activity, HEXIM1 point mutants were co-transfected in 293 cells along with Tat or Gal4-CycT1, respectively. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, unlike wild-type HEXIM1, both mutants were unable to repress Tat as well as Gal4-CycT activities, albeit they were expressed at levels comparable to the wild-type protein. Collectively, the results presented in figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> strongly suggest that HEXIM1-mediated inhibition of Tat activity requires interaction with P-TEFb as well as binding to 7SK snRNA.</p><fig position="float" id="F4"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>On top the relevant HEXIM1 functional domains are depicted.

P-TEFb activity was assayed using as substrate the CTD4 peptide consisting of four consensus repeats of the RNAPII CTD, and time-course kinase assays were performed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Briefly, P-TEFb and its associated factors were affinity purified with anti-CycT1 antibody from mock and F:HEXIM1 transfected cell extracts. Immunoprecipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting for evaluation of CDK9, cyclin T1 and HEXIM1 proteins, respectively. The immunoprecipitates were then treated or not treated with RNase A (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). The RNase treatment will degrade the 7SK snRNA thereby relieving the P-TEFb inhibition by HEXIM1/7SK snRNP. In fact, samples treated with RNase showed a robust increase in kinase activity compared those not treated with RNase, indicating that 7SK snRNA had been effectively degraded. We found that the kinase activities of samples that were treated with RNase were quantitatively the same in both mock and F:HEXIM1 transfected extracts indicating equal amounts total of P-TEFb in both samples. A modest, but reproducible reduction of P-TEFb kinase activity (2-fold) was observed in extracts from F-HEXIM1 transfected cells. Altogether, these results demonstrated that over-expression of HEXIM1 resulted in a modest reduction of P-TEFb activity, thus the inhibition of Tat activity is unlikely due to a global reduction of cellular P-TEFb activity.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>P-TEFb activity in F:HEXIM1 transfected cells.

Cells extracts were immunoprecipitated with CycT1 antibody and the immunoprecipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting for evaluation of Tat, CycT1 and HEXIM1 proteins, respectively. In two different experiments we found a modest, but reproducible decrease in Tat-bound cyclin T1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6B</xref>).

The recruitment of P-TEFb to the LTR, involves the formation of the Tat-P-TEFb complex which efficiently binds TAR, allowing CDK9 to phosphorylate the CTD of RNAPII, thereby, enhances processivity of the polymerase to produce full-length mRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Two different P-TEFb complexes exist in vivo. The core active P-TEFb comprises two subunits, the catalytic CDK9 and a regulatory partner cyclin T, and a larger inactive P-TEFb complex comprised by CDK9, cyclin T, HEXIM1 protein and the 7SK snRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The relative presence of core and inactive P-TEFb complexes changes rapidly in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. We have previously shown that the presence of HEXIM1/7SK snRNA in P-TEFb complexes prevents Tat binding to P-TEFb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Since the association between 7SK RNA/HEXIM1 and P-TEFb competes with binding of Tat to cyclinT1, we have speculated that the TAR RNA/Tat system may compete with the cellular 7SK snRNA/HEXIM1 system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Accordingly, it has been shown that over-expression of HEXIM1 represses Tat function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] We show here that HEXIM1 inhibits Tat function, while expression of 7SK snRNA does not influence Tat activity. It is pertinent to note that 7SK RNA is an abundant snRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], and it is unlikely that 7SK might be rate-limiting for the assembly of the inactive P-TEFb complex.</p><p>We have delineated important structural domains of HEXIM1 required for repression of Tat. First, we found that the C-terminal region is required for inhibition. Previous findings indicated that the C-terminal region of HEXIM1 is involved in binding with cyclinT1 as well as for homo and hetero-dimerization with HEXIM2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Second, point mutations in the evolutionarily conserved motif PYNT (aa 202&#x02013;205) abolished inhibition. It has recently shown a critical role of threonine 205 in P-TEFb binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Moreover, deletion mutants unable to bind P-TEFb failed to repress Tat (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). Therefore, it appears that HEXIM1 inhibition is strictly dependent upon the integrity of the protein to interact with P-TEFb. Third, a point mutant in the central part of HEXIM1 (KHRR motif aa 152&#x02013;155) strongly affects Tat repression. Since this basic motif has been previously shown as the 7SK snRNA recognition motif [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], we conclude that interaction between HEXIM1 and 7SK snRNA is required for Tat repression. Collectively, these findings strongly suggested that HEXIM1-mediated inhibition of Tat required the formation of the P-TEFb/HEXIM1/7SK complex.</p><p>We determined that enhanced expression of HEXIM1 resulted in a modest inhibition (2-fold) of P-TEFb activity in vivo. Thus, HEXIM1-mediated inhibition of Tat activity is unlikely due to a global inhibition of P-TEFb activity. Moreover, we found that basal transcription from the LTR sequences was largely unaffected by over-expression of HEXIM1. Finally, ectopic expression of this protein does not have significant effects on TBP-mediated basal transcription. Thus, it appears that P-TEFb is specifically required for Tat-dependent HIV LTR transcription. Our results differ somewhat from those obtained in the Zhou lab who found that exogenous expression of HEXIM1 affects both basal as well as Tat-induced transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. These apparent discrepancies are possible due to different transfection conditions in which the relative amounts of the over-expressed exogenous proteins are likely different. We found that Tat expression which is under the control of SV40 promoter remains largely unaffected by co-expression of HEXIM. Our findings suggest a dedicated role of P-TEFb in Tat activity. Recent studies point to a specific role of P-TEFb for certain promoters. It has recently found that P-TEFb is recruited to the IL-8 but not to the IkB&#x003b1; promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], and it also represses transcription of regulators such as the nuclear receptor coactivator, PGC-1, in cardiac myocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. The specific HEXIM-mediated inhibition of Tat activity underlines the pivotal role of P-TEFb in the HIV LTR transcription.</p><p>The repression exerted by the HEXIM1 protein is likely the results of a competition between Tat and HEXIM1 in binding the P-TEFb. Since Tat binds only to the active P-TEFb complex, it has been suggested that Tat might trap the active form of P-TEFb as the PTEFb/7SK RNA/HEXIM1 complex appears to undergo continuous formation and disruption <italic>in vivo</italic>. In this scenario over expression of HEXIM1 may counteract the binding of Tat to P-TEFb, through a competitive association between the ectopic expressed HEXIM1 and P-TEFb. Accordingly, we found that exogenous expression of HEXIM1 results in a small but detectable reduction in Tat-bound- P-TEFb. Our co-immunoprecipitation results are consistent with recent findings showing a mutually exclusive interaction of HEXIM1 and Tat with cyclinT1 using recombinant purified proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Because Tat and HEXIM1 interact with the cyclin-box region of cyclinT1, it is plausible if not likely, that the mutually exclusive interaction of these two molecules with cyclinT1 is due to binding to the same domain or to a sterical hindrance. However, these studies have been performed in vitro in the absence of 7SK snRNA.</p><p>The results reported here along with previous findings strongly suggest the crucial role of 7SK in the interaction between HEXIM1 and cyclinT1. In fact, HEXIM1 ILAA mutant does not associate with 7SK in vivo and in vitro, and co-immuprecipitation of cyclinT1 and 7SK RNA was markedly reduced with ILAA mutant compared to wild type [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Finally, as shown here ILAA mutant failed to repress Tat activity, suggesting an important role of HEXIM1/7SK interaction in Tat inhibition. Thus, association between HEXIM1 and 7SK snRNA appears an important determinant for Tat inhibition. Future in vitro and in vivo interaction studies, in the presence of 7SK snRNA may be instrumental to elucidate the role of 7SK/HEXIM1 complex in Tat activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The studies described in this provides further support to the pivotal role of P-TEFb for the optimal transcription Tat activity and highlight the importance of the P-TEFb cellular co-factors HEXIM1/7SK snRNA complex in Tat activity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Tissue culture and transfections</title><p>Human 293 and rodent CHO cells were grown at 37&#x000b0;C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Gibco, Life Technologies).

After extensive washes one half of the immunopurified materials was used in western blotting to ensure the presence of equal amounts of CDK9, HEXIM1 and CycT1, respectively. The remaining material was suspended and stirred at room temperature and split in two equal aliquots. One of the aliquot was treated with 10U of RNase A for 15 min at 30&#x000b0;C.
