Even though the genetic findings are very robust, the physiological role of the predicted G72 protein has thus far not been resolved. Initial reports suggested G72 as an activator of D-amino acid oxidase (DAO), supporting the glutamate dysfunction hypothesis of schizophrenia. However, these findings have subsequently not been reproduced and reports of endogenous human G72 mRNA and protein expression are extremely limited. In order to better understand the function of this putative schizophrenia susceptibility gene, we attempted to demonstrate G72 mRNA and protein expression in relevant human brain regions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The expression of G72 mRNA was studied by northern blotting and semi-quantitative SYBR-Green and Taqman RT-PCR. Protein expression in human tissue lysates was investigated by western blotting using two custom-made specific anti-G72 peptide antibodies. An in-depth <italic>in silico </italic>analysis of the G72/G30 locus was performed in order to try and identify motifs or regulatory elements that provide insight to G72 mRNA expression and transcript stability.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Despite using highly sensitive techniques, we failed to identify significant levels of G72 mRNA in a variety of human tissues (e.g. adult brain, amygdala, caudate nucleus, fetal brain, spinal cord and testis) human cell lines or schizophrenia/control post mortem BA10 samples. Furthermore, using western blotting in combination with sensitive detection methods, we were also unable to detect G72 protein in a number of human brain regions (including cerebellum and amygdala), spinal cord or testis. A detailed <italic>in silico </italic>analysis provides several lines of evidence that support the apparent low or absent expression of G72.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our results suggest that native G72 protein is not normally present in the tissues that we analysed in this study. We also conclude that the lack of demonstrable G72 expression in relevant brain regions does not support a role for G72 in modulation of DAO activity and the pathology of schizophrenia via a DAO-mediated mechanism. <italic>In silico </italic>analysis suggests that G72 is not robustly expressed and that the transcript is potentially labile. Further studies are required to understand the significance of the G72/30 locus to schizophrenia.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>G72 and G30 are overlapping genes transcribed from opposite strands on chromosome 13q33. They were initially identified within a 65 kb region containing markers associated with schizophrenia in two independent disease cohorts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Genetic association between the G72/G30 locus and both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder has subsequently been reported in several studies and is supported by a recent meta-analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Thus, the G72/G30 locus may represent a common susceptibility region for both disorders. Whilst the combined evidence for association with both disorders can be considered robust, associated alleles are not consistent across studies and there may not be a distinct haplotype correlated with disease susceptibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>Multiple transcripts for each gene have been cloned by reverse transcription-PCR from human brain, spinal cord and testis cDNA libraries. The longest G72 open reading frame is predicted to encode a putative 153 amino acid protein, isolated from amygdala, caudate nucleus, spinal cord and testis libraries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. No homology was found between any of the putative protein products from the transcripts of either gene and any known protein. Putative LG72 orthologues were identified <italic>in silico </italic>in rhesus monkey and ape genomes leading to the suggestion that it might represent a rapidly evolving primate-specific gene. <italic>In vitro </italic>transcription/translation assays with the cloned G72 and G30 candidate transcripts yielded a protein product for LG72 only, which generated a 24-kDa translation product (pLG72) that was reported to localise at the Golgi apparatus in transiently transfected cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. A more recent study, however, demonstrated mitochondrial localisation of overexpressed G72 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Yeast two-hybrid screening identified D-amino acid oxidase (DAO) as a putative protein interactor of pLG72 and recombinant pLG72 was demonstrated to behave as an activator of DAO <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. On the basis of this observation, which has subsequently not been reproduced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], G72 has been renamed D-amino acid oxidase activator (DAOA). DAO catabolises D-amino acids including D-serine which is a co-agonist at the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. As NMDA receptor hypofunction has been implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, the report of a functional interaction between G72 and DAO suggests a pathway whereby G72 could modulate DAO activity, D-serine levels and NMDA receptor activity and, thus, contribute to the disease pathology.</p><p>To date, however, there have been no convincing reports of expression of native G72 (or G30) protein and accordingly no confirmation of the G72-DAO interaction <italic>in situ</italic>. Moreover, reports of native G72/G30 mRNA expression are limited. In addition to the original study by Chumakov <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], cDNAs have also been amplified from human and testis libraries by Hattori <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] although only after &#x02265; 40 cycles of PCR. Korostishevsky <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] have subsequently utilised real-time PCR to detect and quantify G72 and G30 mRNA in human post-mortem dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, reporting a tendency towards overexpression of G72 but not G30 transcripts in schizophrenic versus control brain. In order to learn more about the potential role of this schizophrenia susceptibility gene, we have analysed the gene structure and genomic context of G72/G30 and investigated expression of G72 in human tissues at the mRNA and protein level.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cloning of human G72</title><p>Full-length human G72 cDNA (identical to published GenBank sequence <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AY138546">AY138546</ext-link>, which results in the longest predicted protein) was amplified from human testis Marathon cDNA (Clontech) by nested PCR with forward primer 5'-GACCCAAAATGCTGGAAAAGCTGAT-3' and reverse primer 5'-CATCAGAAGGATTGGCTGGGAAGAAT-3' and cloned into pCDNA3.2/GW/D-TOPO. In order to obtain N-terminally epitope-tagged G72 in mammalian expression vectors, G72 cDNA was PCR-amplified from above template vector with forward primer 5'-CACCATGCTGGAAAAGCTGATGGGTGC-3' and reverse primer 5'-TCATTCAGCTTTGGTAGAAGTTATTTCCTTGTGG-3'. The PCR product was cloned into pENTR/D-TOPO entry vector using pENTR Directional TOPO Cloning Kit (Invitrogen), following manufacturer's instructions. Resulting entry clones were used in LR recombination reactions (Invitrogen) with pDEST26 (Invitrogen) and pDEST12.2-FLAG (kind gift from Jan Kopf) Gateway destination vector, to obtain G72 cDNA in frame with the respective N-terminal epitope tag (6 &#x000d7; His or FLAG-tag).</p></sec><sec><title>Cell culture and transient transfection</title><p>HEK-293 cells were cultured in Minimum Essential Medium (MEM, Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and non-essential amino acids (Gibco) at 37&#x000b0;C and 10% CO<sub>2</sub>. Cells were transiently transfected using Fugene-6 (Roche) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were plated one day before transfection at 4 &#x000d7; 10<sup>6 </sup>cells per 10 cm-plate, transfected with 5&#x02013;7 &#x003bc;g plasmid DNA and incubated with transfection mix (complex of plasmid-DNA and Fugene 6 at a ratio of 1:3) for ~40 h prior to preparation of protein lysates.</p></sec><sec><title>RNA isolation and Northern Analysis of G72 mRNA</title><p>Total RNA was isolated from HEK-293 cells (mock-transfected or overexpressing His-G72) using the Qiagen RNeasy protocol, according to manufacturer's instructions. The optional on-column DNase digestion step was performed using the Qiagen RNase-free DNase set. RNA was eluted in 40 &#x003bc;l of RNAse-free water and quantified using a spectrophotometer.</p><p>For northern gels, 10 &#x003bc;g total RNA in NorthernMax Formaldehyde sample buffer (Ambion) were loaded per lane. Northern blotting was performed as described in "Promega protocols and applications guide", third edition (1996). Briefly, a formaldehyde-containing 1.2% agarose gel was prepared in 1&#x000d7; MOPS buffer. The gel was run in 1&#x000d7; MOPS buffer at 5 V/cm with regular buffer mixing. After completion, the gel was washed three times for 10 min in RNAse-free dH<sub>2</sub>O, soaked 15 min in 0.05 M NaOH, neutralised 15 min in 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5 and soaked for 30 min in 20&#x000d7; SSC before capillary transfer (over-night) onto Hybond-N+ nylon membrane (Amersham). RNA was UV-crosslinked to the membrane (UV Stratalinker) and dried for at least 2 h prior to further use.</p><p>Northern blots were probed with a 390 bp NotI-XbaI fragment of G72 cDNA (corresponding to G72 clone AY138546 cDNA without the last 3'-terminal 85 nucleotides) or with beta-actin control probe (BD Biosciences). Probes were <sup>32</sup>P-dCTP-labelled using Rediprime II Random Prime Labelling System (Amersham) according to manufacturer's instructions and purified with spin columns (Amersham). Prehybridisation and probe hybridisation were performed with Rapid-hyb buffer (Amersham) at 70&#x000b0;C, according to manufacturer's instructions. Stringency washes were performed according to the Rapid-hyb protocol (Amersham). Briefly, membranes were washed for 20 min at room temperature in washing buffer 1 (2&#x000d7; SSC, 0.1% (w/v) SDS) and twice for 15 min at 65&#x000b0;C in washing buffer 2 (0.1&#x000d7; SSC, 0.1% (w/v) SDS). Signals were detected using a sensitive phosphorimager (Typhoon Trio, Amersham), with exposure times between 2 h and over-night.</p><p>Alternatively, commercial human brain multiple tissue Northern (MTN) blots (Clontech/BD Biosciences MTN blot II and blot V) were used for analysis of G72 expression in human brain. Blots (nylon membrane) contained approximately 2 &#x003bc;g of poly A+ RNA per lane from eight (MTN blot II) or six (MTN blot V) different brain regions. Hybridisation conditions were essentially as described above, but less stringent conditions (washing buffer 2 at 55&#x000b0;C instead of 65&#x000b0;C) and longer exposure times of up to three days (phosphorimager, Typhoon Trio, Amersham) were used in order to detect even weak signals. Following G72 probing, membranes were stripped with boiling 0.5% SDS and reprobed with a beta-actin-probe to test for equal loading and good RNA quality.</p><p>Alternatively to radioactive labelling, northern blots were probed with biotinylated dCTP, using the "SpotLight Random Primer Labeling Kit" according to manufacturer's instructions (BD Biosciences, Clontech). Hybridisation and chemiluminescent detection were carried out using the "SpotLight Chemiluminescent Hybridisation and Detection Kit" (BD Biosciences, Clontech). This method appeared to be less sensitive compared to radioactive detection.</p></sec><sec><title>Real-time RT-PCR</title><p>Five different primer sets were designed within G72 exons that are common to most G72 splice variants (Exons 2, 4 and 7). Sequences are shown in table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>; G72 #2 corresponds to the primer pair used by Korostishevsky <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. All primer sets were tested by SYBR Green PCR (and TaqMan PCR, if applicable) on human genomic DNA (Clontech; 0.1 ng &#x02013; 0.1 &#x003bc;g per reaction), human adult total brain, amygdala, testis and fetal brain cDNA (Marathon Ready cDNA, Clontech; 0.1 &#x02013; 0.5 ng cDNA per reaction) and cDNA from HEK-293 cells overexpressing recombinant His-G72 cDNA (see below). Total RNA was isolated from HEK-293 cells (mock-transfected or overexpressing His-G72) as described above. Samples were reverse transcribed (in triplicate) into cDNA using the Omniscript RT-PCR kit (Qiagen). Briefly, for each 20 &#x003bc;l reverse transcription reaction, 300 ng RNA in a total volume of 12 &#x003bc;l was added to 8 &#x003bc;l RT-PCR mastermix (final concentrations/amounts: 1 &#x003bc;M Oligo-dT primer (Invitrogen), 0.5 mM each dNTP, 1&#x000d7; RT Buffer, 10 units RNase inhibitor (Invitrogen), and 4 units Omniscript Reverse Transcriptase). Negative controls were prepared as above, but without Reverse Transcriptase. Reactions were incubated for 60 min at 37&#x000b0;C. The masterplate was aliquoted into 20 optical 96-well plates using the Hydra-96 robot (Robbins Scientific, GRI). Taqman PCR was performed using an ABI 7700 Sequence Detection system (PE Applied Biosystems) as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Briefly, the PCR reaction mastermix contained a final concentration of 200 nM of each of the forward and reverse primers (see table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>; Invitrogen), 200 nM FAM-TAMRA probe (Qiagen, Operon), and 1&#x000d7; Quantitect master mix (Qiagen). For SYBR Green chemistry, 1&#x000d7; SYBR Green mastermix (Perkin Elmer) was used, and no probe was added to the reaction. The PCR amplification was performed for 40 cycles, consisting of 50&#x000b0;C for 2 min, 95&#x000b0;C for 10 min, 40 cycles of 95&#x000b0;C for 15 s and 60&#x000b0;C for 1 min. Standards were analysed on each plate using dilutions of genomic DNA. All measurements were performed in triplicate. The housekeeping gene cyclophilin was run as a control to ensure comparable amounts of cDNA in all wells. Ct values were converted into arbitrary units according to manufacturer's instructions (Applied Biosystems).</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Primer and probe sequences for G72 and cyclophilin</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left">Primer name &#x00026; location</td><td align="left">Primer and probe sequence (F: forward, R: reverse, P: probe)</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">G72 #1 (Exon 4)</td><td align="left">F: 5'-GGATGGAAGAGAAGGCATGAGG-3'</td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="left">R: 5'-TCTGCATAGGGCTGAGGAAGG-3'</td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="left">P: 5'-ATTTGGAAATGGCACAGAGG-3'</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left">G72 #2 (Exon 7)</td><td align="left">F: 5'-GCTGAATGAGTTTGGAAGCA-3'</td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="left">R: 5'-TGGGTCCCAGACACAGAGT-3'</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left">G72 #3 (Exon 2)</td><td align="left">F: 5'-CATTGGGTAAAATCTACTTCATAGG-3'</td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="left">R: 5'-GAGTTTAGAGAGTTTTCAGATTTGC-3'</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left">G72 #4 (Exon 4)</td><td align="left">F: 5'-GCATGAGGACGGCTATTTGG-3'</td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="left">R: 5'-TCTGCATAGGGCTGAGGAAGG-3'</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left">G72 #5 (Exon 7)</td><td align="left">F: 5'-CCGCAGGCAGCCTCTAGAAC-3'</td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="left">R: 5'-TCAGAAGGATTGGCTGGGAAG-3'</td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="left">P: 5'-CCAGCAAAAAGACCAGTCATGCAACCA-3'</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><hr></hr></td></tr><tr><td align="left">Cyclophilin</td><td align="left">F: 5'-TGAGACAGCAGATAGAGCCAAGC-3'</td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="left">R: 5'-TCCCTGCCAATTTGACATCTTC-3'</td></tr><tr><td></td><td align="left">P: 5'-AGCACCAATATTCAGTACACAGCTTAAAGCTATAGGTT-3'</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>Primers and probes for G72 Real-Time RT-PCR (SYBR<sup>&#x000ae; </sup>Green and TaqMan<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) and for the housekeeper gene cyclophilin are shown above.

As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, a strong and specific signal was seen in His-G72 overexpressing cells, but not in mock-transfected cells. RNA from both His-G72 and mock-transfected cells showed a strong beta-actin signal (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>, right). We next sought to investigate expression of G72 mRNA across a variety of human CNS regions, using Clontech MTN (Multiple Tissue Northern) human brain blots. The northern membranes contained 2 &#x003bc;g of poly A+ mRNA per lane, a quantity that should allow detection of rare messages. Probes were radioactively labelled, since initial experiments had shown a lower sensitivity of non-radioactively labelled probes (data not shown). In order to increase the probability of detecting potentially low levels of G72, washing conditions were kept at a low stringency (see Methods), and phosphorimager exposure times were increased to up to three days. Whereas a strong G72 signal was visible after 2 &#x02013; 12 hours on the validation blots (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>), no G72 mRNA was detected in any of the CNS regions tested, even after very long exposure times (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). These results were unexpected, since CNS regions represented on Clontech human brain blots II and V included amygdala (lane 14), caudate nucleus (lane 13) and spinal cord (lane 5), i.e. regions from which G72 has previously been cloned [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Lane 8 contained mRNA from cerebellum, a region that might be expected to express G72 if its role was indeed regulation of D-amino acid oxidase which is expressed at highest levels in this brain region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. However, this brain region was also devoid of detectable G72 mRNA. In order to control for RNA integrity and similar RNA loading in all lanes, G72-probed northern membranes were stripped and reprobed with a beta-actin probe. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>, a strong actin signal was observed after short exposure times (2 &#x02013; 6 hours).

Five primer sets (see table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> in Methods) were designed within G72 exons that are common to most G72 splice variants (exons 2, 4 and 7; see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>), including one primer pair (#2) previously used by Korostishevsky <italic>et al</italic>.

Primer design within exons, rather than across exon-intron boundaries, allowed validation of primer sets using human genomic DNA (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). However, as the small size of all exons limited the possibilities for primer and probe design, SYBR Green chemistry (primer sets #2, #3 and #4) was used as an alternative to TaqMan RT-PCR (primer sets #1 and #5).

No signal was obtained using rat genomic DNA (data not shown), proving specificity of the primers for human G72, as the rat genome does not contain a G72 gene (see below, and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]). However, none of the primer pairs detected significant levels of G72 mRNA in human cDNA from brain, testis, spinal cord or amygdala, i.e. regions from which G72 has reportedly been cloned. In addition, no G72 amplification could be achieved in cDNA from human fetal brain (Clontech) or in more than ten different human cell lines. Since it has previously been suggested that G72 might be upregulated in schizophrenic brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], we also investigated G72 expression in a carefully selected set of human post-mortem brain BA10 samples from more than 25 schizophrenic patients and matched controls (Charing Cross Hospital Prospective Collection). No expression of G72 mRNA could be detected in either control or schizophrenic brain (random hexamer primed cDNA: data not shown). This result is in contradiction to a previously published report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], but is consistent with other unreported results (e.g. Dr. Phil Burnet, University of Oxford: personal communication using the Stanley Foundation Samples).</p><p>In order to verify that our primer sets were able to amplify G72 from cDNA, and not only from genomic DNA, we prepared cDNA from HEK-293 cells expressing a His-tagged version of the longest G72 ORF, the coding region of variant AY138546 (His-G72). Only primer sets within exon 2 and 4 (#1, #3, #4) were expected to give a signal using His-G72 cDNA. The reverse primers of primer sets in exon 7 (#2 and #5) were designed to anneal to the untranslated 3'-UTR region which was not contained within our expression plasmid. However, the 3'-UTR is reportedly present within the splice variants described in GenBank and thus primer sets in exon 7 were expected to work on human cDNA samples. As shown in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref>, primer sets within exons 2 and 4 readily amplified G72 cDNA from G72-overexpressing cells, thus confirming that our primers were able to detect G72 cDNA when mRNA is expressed at appreciable levels. Real-time semi-quantitative PCR is a highly sensitive technique that we and others have previously used to amplify rare messages. Our results therefore suggest that endogenous expression levels in adult human total brain, testis, spinal cord, amygdala, BA10, or human fetal brain are below the detection limit for TaqMan/SYBR Green PCR and must thus be extremely low, if present.</p></sec><sec><title>Generation and validation of G72 antibodies</title><p>Four antibodies against two G72 peptides were raised in rabbits.

This strongly suggests no expression of G72 in these species in the tissues represented in the EST databases (or that it is only expressed in very specific libraries). Difficulties in detecting substantial G72 expression could potentially be accounted for by unstable mRNA species. The RNA instability motif search run on the G72 UTRs predicts one ATTTA motif in the 5'UTR of G72. These motifs are generally found in unstable mammalian mRNA UTRs and represent the most widespread and efficient determinant of RNA instability among those characterized in mammalian cells, marking RNAs for rapid destruction unless protected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>].</p><p>The G72 transcript sequence was also analysed by two miRNA prediction programs in order to investigate if it could be regulated by miRNAs. Using both methods, two (hsa-mir-600 and hsa-mir-196a-2) miRNAs predicted to bind to the 3'UTR (exon 7a and 8 of G72, see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5B</xref>, corresponding to the 4<sup>th </sup>and 5<sup>th </sup>exon of the AY138546 variant) were identified. Although these programs predict miRNA target sites, the binding of the miRNAs to G72 would depend on other factors. For example, both the miRNA and transcript must be expressed in the same tissue at the same time and the folding of the mRNA UTR could affect accessibility of the miRNA to the binding site. For this reason it would be important to experimentally confirm these <italic>in silico </italic>predictions.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The G72/30 locus has received considerable attention due to replicated disease association data for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Furthermore, it has been proposed that the G72 peptide is a direct modulator of DAO activity and as such has mechanistic relevance to schizophrenia.</p><p>In order to better understand the function of G72, we investigated expression of both the G72 mRNA and putative protein in a series of human CNS and peripheral tissue samples. We were unable to detect the G72 message using either Taqman or northern analysis (13 brain regions) in any of our human tissue samples including cerebral cortex, amygdala, caudate nucleus, spinal cord and testis, i.e. tissues from which G72 had previously been cloned [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. We also analysed over 25 control and 25 schizophrenic patient BA10 samples and could not detect the G72 transcript in the control or disease samples. Furthermore, we generated two specific and sensitive antibodies to a G72 peptide (amino acids 55&#x02013;69 of LG72). Although the recombinant protein was readily detected by western blotting and immunocytochemistry, native protein was not observed in different tissues reportedly expressing G72.</p><p>Several gene detection methods that combine DNA/protein database searches and comparative analysis of conserved vertebrate DNA sequences predict the G72 gene at the locus on human chromosome 13q.33. Our in silico analysis, however, indicates that the G72 gene lacks features of a robustly transcribed gene and moreover contains an instability sequence that is generally found in unstable mammalian mRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. There is also evidence for the presence of miRNA cognate sites, which regulate the expression of target genes by binding to their mRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. These findings suggest that the G72 transcript may be rapidly removed if or when it is expressed. Furthermore, endogenous RNA interference between G72 and G30 (which is transcribed in the opposite direction) may also account for very low or no detectable expression, as suggested previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>There is some evidence that G72 is only present in higher primates and not in rodent species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Extensive genomic sequence analysis identifies some regions of homology to human G72 in <italic>Pan troglodytes </italic>(chimpanzee), <italic>Gorilla gorilla </italic>(gorilla), <italic>Pongo pygmaeus </italic>(orangutan), <italic>Hylobates sp</italic>. (gibbon), <italic>Macaca mulatta </italic>(rhesus monkey) and <italic>Callithrix jacchus </italic>(marmoset) genomic sequences. There are, however, no full-length primate orthologues and for example, there are two stop codons in the predicted chimpanzee G72 transcript sequence, suggesting this could in fact be a pseudogene and furthermore that AY138546 (and NM_172370.3) is unique to humans.</p><p>Although we (and others: Dr. Phil Burnet, University of Oxford, personal communication) have been unable to detect G72 mRNA, it has been possible to clone G72 from several libraries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Indeed, we have cloned G72 cDNA from a testis cDNA library, but nevertheless failed to detect appreciable levels of G72 from the same testis cDNA sample using TaqMan or SYBR Green RT-PCR. Since these methods can detect tens of copies of a gene, expression levels below this detection limit are indicative of either no expression within any of the investigated tissues, or of an extremely localised or tightly regulated expression.</p><p>A significant percentage of human mRNA transcripts are either not polyadenylated or are bimorphic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Although we failed to detect G72 transcripts in polyadenylated mRNA samples (northern analysis; real-time semiquantitative RT PCR analysis using cDNA from cell lines or Clontech "Marathon Ready cDNA") we also did not detect G72 transcripts in the human post mortem samples that were prepared with random hexamers, which excludes the possibility that our analysis may have failed to detect G72 transcripts based on the method of cDNA synthesis from isolated RNA. A possible reason why e.g. Korostishevsky et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] observed a G72 PCR product may be explained by the apparent lack of sample treatment to eliminate contaminating genomic DNA and the absence of RT minus PCR controls for signal detection. We used the same primer pair as described by that group (primer set #2) and furthermore confirmed activity on genomic DNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). It would seem likely therefore that the discrepancy between that study and our study (and others) might be explained by amplification from contaminating genomic DNA.</p><p>It should be noted that a recent study also reports difficulty in identifying native G72 protein and failed to replicate the proposed modulation of DAO activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The authors claim, however, to detect the native protein in a small (0.01%) sub-population of HeLa cells and in the membrane fraction of human amygdala. We have also analysed G72 expression (mRNA and protein) in the human amygdala and found no detectable G72 present. The antibody generated in the present study is very similar to that described by Kvajo <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] in that we used the same epitope to generate the antibody and the cellular localisation of recombinant G72 is also punctuate/tubular rather that Golgi-restricted as suggested by Chumakov <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] (Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). We also detected recombinant G72 by western analysis but not the native protein in tissue or cell extracts. When combining a very sensitive western blot detection method and long exposure times, a signal at around 20 kDa, i.e. just above the expected size of human G72 (18 kDa) was detected in human fetal brain lysate (Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). However, this signal was only observed with one of our two validated anti-G72 antibodies and a signal at the same apparent molecular weight was also detected in brain lysates from rat, which does not have a G72 gene, thus making it highly unlikely that this band represents G72. These results highlight the importance of suitable negative controls, as well as the danger of potentially misinterpreting bands if technical limits of the method are pushed (e.g. through loading of large protein quantities, long exposure times and high antibody concentration).</p><p>While further studies are required to understand the significance of the G72/30 locus to schizophrenia, we propose that if native G72 protein exists at all, it is expressed at such low levels that any physiological role is called in to question. We also conclude that the lack of demonstrable G72 expression in relevant brain regions does not support a role for G72 protein in modulation of DAO activity and the pathology of schizophrenia via a DAO-mediated mechanism. Following the original proposal for a direct G72 and DAO interaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], the interaction has not been confirmed using an endogenous tissue source. More importantly, two recent reports have failed to confirm the previous findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], which is consistent with our own inability to reproduce the protein-protein interaction of G72 and DAO using recombinantly expressed proteins (data not shown).</p><p>Whilst we were unable to detect G72 expression in human fetal brain, it remains a possibility that G72 is developmentally regulated and plays a unique spatio-temporal role in human brain development, independent of an interaction with DAO. We have not had the opportunity to investigate this further.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Robust genetic findings from several independent studies have suggested the G72/G30 locus as a common susceptibility region for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. This study investigated the mRNA and protein expression of the G72 gene product in human tissues and aimed to shed light on the physiological role of the predicted G72 protein, which has thus far not been resolved. Our experimental results, supported by an <italic>in silico </italic>analysis, do not provide any evidence of appreciable G72 expression in human brain or other human tissues at either the mRNA or the protein level. Thus, native G72 protein, if expressed at all, appears to only be present at extremely low levels that may not be physiologically relevant. This casts doubt on the proposed G72 protein modulation of DAO activity, which has been suggested to contribute to the pathology of schizophrenia. Further studies are required therefore to understand the significance of the G72/30 locus to schizophrenia.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>IB: Experimental design, conducted all experiments that contributed to Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref> and Additional files <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref> &#x00026;<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>, analysis of results, writing of manuscript, discussion of experimental results.
