The washed pellet was again suspended in solubilization buffer, and freshly prepared egg white lysozyme (Sigma) and DNase A (Worthington Biochemical Corporation) were added to a final concentration of 200 and 0.2 &#x000b5;g&#x0002f;ml, respectively, according to a protocol supplied by Pierce Chemical Co. After 5 min incubation on ice, 600 ml of 0.1&#x000d7; solubilization buffer was added, and the solution was centrifuged for 20 min at 27 200 <italic>g</italic>. In small scale preparations, the supernatant of this latter centrifugation step contained the <italic>T</italic>.<italic>maritima</italic> RNase P protein, but &#x0003e;50&#x00025; of the total recombinant protein remained in the pellet after large scale purification.</p></sec><sec><title>Purification of RNase P protein under non-denaturing conditions</title><p>The soluble recombinant protein could be precipitated with 2.5&#x000a0;M, but not with 1 M ammonium sulfate (pH 7.9). Two successive ammonium sulfate precipitations were, therefore, performed: first with 1 M ammonium sulfate during which most of the recombinant protein stayed in the supernatant, and then with 2.5 M ammonium sulfate. After centrifugation (20&#x000a0;min at 27 200 <italic>g</italic>) the ammonium sulfate pellet was dissolved in ~3 ml of 1&#x000d7; His-binding buffer (500 mM NaCl, 20&#x000a0;mM Tris, 5 mM imidazole, pH 7.9), and loaded on a His-Resin column (5 ml; Novagen) equilibrated with the same buffer. The column was washed with &#x0223c;30 vol 1&#x000d7; His-binding buffer, and then a gradient of imidazole (from 5 mM to 1 M) was applied to elute the recombinant protein. Fractions containing protein &#x0005b;as determined by the Bradford method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke195c9">9</xref>)&#x0005d; were dialyzed against 20 mM Tris, 100 mM ammonium acetate, pH 7.9. However, recombinant protein precipitated out of the solution both before and after dialysis, an indication that this protein was insoluble at high concentrations. Efforts to solubilize the precipitated protein in the absence of urea or guanidinium hydrochloride have been unsuccessful to date.</p></sec><sec><title>Purification under denaturing conditions</title><p>Protein which remained insoluble after the lysozyme treatment of the lysed cell pellet (see above) could be dissolved by addition of guanidinium&#x02013;HCl as a dry powder to a final concentration of 6 M in 500 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris, 5 mM imidazole, pH 7.9. His-Resin (5 ml equilibrated in the same buffer) was then added to the solution. After stirring on ice for 1 h, the His-Resin was recovered by centrifugation (5 min at 1000 <italic>g</italic>), and poured into a column. The column was washed successively with 5 vol 6 M guanidinium&#x02013;HCl (500 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris, 5 mM imidazole, pH 7.9) and 25 vol 6 M urea (500 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris, 5 mM imidazole, pH 7.9). The recombinant protein was eluted with an imidazole gradient (from 5 mM to 1 M). After elution, the fractions containing the protein, as determined by Bradford assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke195c9">9</xref>), were immediately dialyzed against 6 M urea, 20 mM Tris and 100 mM ammonium acetate, pH 7.9. The identity of the purified recombinant protein was confirmed by mass spectroscopy analysis at the Keck Center of Yale University.</p></sec><sec><title>Assays of RNase P activity and reconstitution of the RNase P holoenzyme</title><p>Freshly diluted (to 100 nM) recombinant protein was added in 10-fold molar excess to the RNA subunit of RNase P that had been transcribed <italic>in vitro</italic>. After incubation for 5 min in the RNase P reaction buffer (e.g., 400 mM NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>) at the assay temperature, the reaction was started by the addition of labeled substrate</p><p> To calculate the initial velocity of the reactions, aliquots were withdrawn at regular time intervals (1 or 2 min) and quenched with 9 M urea&#x0002f;10&#x00025; phenol.

Measurements of the extent of cleavage were always restricted to the linear range of product formation.</p></sec><sec><title>Determination of kinetic constants of <italic>T.maritima</italic> RNase P</title><p>Initial velocities were determined by incubation of 1 nM RNA and 10 nM protein subunits in buffer that contained 400 mM NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, and 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> at 50&#x000b0;C. The reactions were started by addition of various concentrations (35, 50, 75, 100, 150 or 180 nM) of <sup>32</sup>P-labeled substrate. Aliquots were taken at 1 min intervals and analyzed as described above for RNase P assays. The numbers cited in the text reflect the results of four independent experiments and were determined using a Lineweaver&#x02013;Burk plot.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>RESULTS AND DISCUSSION</title><sec><title>Purification of the <italic>T.maritima</italic> RNase P protein subunit</title><p>The <italic>T.maritima</italic> RNase P protein subunit was purified as described in Materials and Methods. Overexpressed recombinant protein was analyzed on SDS&#x02013;polyacrylamide gels to show that it was purified to apparent homogeneity. The purification procedure under denaturing conditions proved to be somewhat more efficient in removing contaminating host cell proteins (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke195f1">1</xref>). RNase P protein samples purified both under denaturing and non-denaturing conditions were also analyzed by mass spectroscopy. The analysis revealed the initiator methionine at the N-terminus to be missing in both protein samples, and the appropriate C-termini, as well as the rest of the sequence, to be present.</p></sec><sec><title>Characterization of the enzymatic activity of the <italic>T.maritima</italic> RNase P holoenzyme</title><p>We compared the activities of the RNase P RNA subunit alone, the holoenzyme (consisting of the RNA and protein subunits) and the protein subunit alone (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke195f2">2</xref>). The RNA subunit alone was active only in buffer that contained high concentrations of MgCl<sub>2</sub> (e.g., 100 mM) as has been found for the RNA subunits of RNase P from other bacterial sources. In contrast, the holoenzyme was optimally active in a buffer that contained 10&#x000a0;mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>. The protein subunit alone showed no activity at all. These results are in accordance with experiments performed with the RNase P holoenzymes and RNase P RNA subunits of other Eubacteria and show that the RNA is catalytic, while the protein subunit has an auxiliary function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke195c10">10</xref>).</p><p> We compared the activity of <italic>T.maritima </italic>RNase P holoenzyme reconstituted with the protein subunit purified under both denaturing and non-denaturing conditions (data not shown). No difference in the specificity or amount of specific activity for protein purified under denaturing or non-denaturing conditions was found. In both cases, maximal activity was observed when the protein subunit was added in 10-fold molar excess to the RNA subunit. We conclude that protein stored in 6 M urea buffer is able to refold and reconstitute functional holoenzyme after its dilution into buffer lacking urea and addition of the RNA subunit.</p><p> Further characterization of the <italic>T.maritima</italic> RNase P holoenzyme was undertaken with a 10-fold molar excess of the RNase P protein subunit purified under denaturing conditions with respect to the concentration of the RNA subunit. This resulted in a urea concentration of 4 mM in the reaction mixtures (urea in a concentration up to 40 mM had little effect on the activity of the holoenzyme; data not shown).</p><p> Optimal conditions for the specific cleavage of precursor tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup> by <italic>T.maritima</italic> RNase P were determined at 50&#x000b0;C (see below). The dependence of the reaction on monovalent cations was determined in a buffer that contained 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, and 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>. Potassium chloride yielded optimal activity at a concentration of 200 mM (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke195f3">3</xref>A), sodium chloride at 50 mM (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke195f3">3</xref>B) and ammonium chloride between 200 and 400 mM (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke195f3">3</xref>C).</p><p> The dependence of <italic>T.maritima</italic> RNase P holoenzyme on the presence of magnesium was determined in a buffer that contained 50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, and 400 mM NH<sub>4</sub>Cl. The peak of activity was at 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke195f3">3</xref>D).</p><p> The pH dependence of the enzyme was determined in buffers containing 5 or 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 400 mM NH<sub>4</sub>Cl. Tris&#x02013;HCl (50 mM) was used as buffer for the pH range 7.0&#x02013;9.0, and 50 mM Bis&#x02013;Tris&#x02013;propane buffer for the pH range 6.5&#x02013;9.5 &#x0005b;(Bis&#x02013;Tris&#x02013;propane was toxic to RNase P at concentrations &#x0003e;50 mM) (data not shown)&#x0005d;. The maximum of specific activity occurred near pH 7.5 in both buffer systems. HEPES buffer at pH 7.5 showed no significant inhibition of holoenzyme activity at various concentrations (data not shown). HEPES buffer was, therefore, used in further experiments with the holoenzyme.</p></sec><sec><title>Determination of <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> and <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub></title><p>The <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> and <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> of the <italic>T.maritima</italic> holoenzyme were determined at 50&#x000b0;C with 1 nM RNase P RNA and 10 nM RNase P protein in a buffer that contained 400 mM NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, and 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> as further described in Materials and Methods.

In all these buffer systems, the optimal temperature for activity was 50&#x000b0;C (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke195f4">4</xref>). This finding is in marked contrast to the optimal growth temperature of <italic>T.maritima</italic>, which is &#x0223c;80&#x000b0;C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke195c1">1</xref>). Of course, we cannot exclude the possibility that the holoenzyme would manifest greater thermal stability in buffers of composition yet to be determined.</p><p> We note that measurements of activity versus temperature were also carried out with precursor tRNA substrates from <italic>T.maritima</italic>: no differences in temperature optima compared to those measured with substrate from <italic>E.coli</italic> were found but the absolute activities of the enzyme variations listed in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gke195tb1">1</xref> were somewhat higher with the <italic>T.maritima</italic> substrates at higher temperatures (data not shown).</p><p> The sequence of the recombinant protein is not identical to the native amino acid sequence since alterations were introduced at both the N-terminus (an additional glycine residue) and at the C-terminus (the poly-histidine tag; Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gke195f1">1</xref>). However, another recombinant <italic>T.maritima</italic> RNase P protein subunit with an N-terminal His-tag, but no additional glycine residue after the initiator methionine, also showed optimal activity in reconstitution experiments near 50&#x000b0;C (data not shown).</p><p> The comparison of the amino acid sequences of bacterial RNase P protein subunits shows homology mainly between internal portions of the proteins and less conservation near the N- and C-termini (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gke195c11">11</xref>). We would expect, therefore, that the recombinant proteins we used would function in an equivalent manner to the wild-type protein.</p></sec><sec><title>Heterologous reconstitution of the RNase P protein subunits of <italic>T.maritima</italic> and <italic>E.coli</italic> with RNase P RNA subunits</title><p>Heterologous reconstitution <italic>in vitro</italic> of the RNase P protein subunits from <italic>T.maritima</italic> and <italic>E.coli</italic> with the RNase P RNA subunits from <italic>T</italic>.<italic>maritima</italic>, <italic>E.coli</italic> and <italic>Thermus thermophilus</italic> were carried out to determine which of the two subunits might be responsible for comparative thermal stability, if any, of these complexes.
