PALB2 supports BRCA2 stability and determines its localization in the nucleus after DNA damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Relocation of PALB2 and BRCA2 to damaged chromatin is regulated by BRCA1 (Breast Cancer 1) protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. These three proteins form a complex in which PALB2 acts as a bridge between BRCA1 and BRCA2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. In cells depleted of PALB2, DNA repair pathway dependent on the BRCA1/2 is disrupted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. This suggests that inactivation of the <italic>PALB2 </italic>gene may cause similar biological and phenotypic changes as inactivation of the <italic>BRCA1 </italic>or <italic>BRCA2 </italic>genes; the latter is responsible for a fraction of breast and ovarian cancers, and a dysfunction of BRCA2 alone - for the Fanconi anemia (FA) syndrome.</p><p>FA syndrome is a genetic disorder caused by germline biallelic mutations in one of 13 genes (including <italic>FANCD1</italic>/<italic>BRCA2 </italic>and <italic>FANCN</italic>/<italic>PALB2</italic>) of the so-called FA/BRCA pathway; this pathway controls the repair of double strand-breaks and the response to DNA crosslinking agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Studies on FA patients provide evidence that biallelic mutations of the <italic>PALB2 </italic>gene are responsible for one of the syndrome's subtypes, which is very similar to the one caused by inactivation of the <italic>BRCA2 </italic>gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>Mutations of the <italic>BRCA1 </italic>and <italic>BRCA2 </italic>genes are the best known alterations of the FA/BRCA pathway. Heterozygous germline mutations of these genes predispose to breast and ovarian cancers. The cumulative risk of ovarian cancer to age 70 years for women with a <italic>BRCA1 </italic>or <italic>BRCA2 </italic>mutation is estimated at about 40% and 10%, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The cooperation between BRCA2 and PALB2 during the DNA repair process and similarity in clinical features of the FA syndrome caused by biallelic mutations of <italic>BRCA2 </italic>and <italic>PALB2 </italic>genes suggest the role of <italic>PALB2 </italic>alterations in carcinogenesis. To date, <italic>PALB2 </italic>alterations have been associated with familial breast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] and pancreatic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] cancers. To our knowledge, <italic>PALB2 </italic>gene has not been extensively studied in ovarian cancer patients.</p><p>We demonstrate a novel inherited monoallelic deletion of the <italic>PALB2 </italic>gene in ovarian and breast cancer patients which seems to be a recurrent mutation for the population of central Poland.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>The study was performed on a series of 339 non-consecutive patients with ovarian cancer and 982 patients with breast cancer; all patients were Caucasian women from central Poland.</p></sec><sec><title>Ovarian cancer patients</title><p>The analysis was performed on tumor fragments (n = 339); patients' blood samples were used to confirm germline origin of the detected variants only. The samples were collected in two Warsaw hospitals (Institute of Oncology and Brodnowski Hospital) between the years 1995 and 2007. These hospitals treat cancer patients from central Poland.

The probands were patients of the following departments of the Institute of Oncology: Breast Tumors and Reconstructive Surgery, and Genetic Counselling. <italic>BRCA1 </italic>mutations (exons 2, 5, 11 and 20) had been previously detected for the purpose of counselling in 75 of 982 breast cancer patients (8.3%).

It may be expected that due to this deletion PALB2 protein is shortened to 169 amino acids from 1186 amino acids of the wild type and it is devoid of C-terminal domain (with WD40 repeats). WD40 motifs are thought to be responsible for protein-protein interactions and they seem to be necessary for BRCA2/PALB2 complex formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. It was shown that <italic>PALB2 </italic>mutants (229delT, 2521delA and c.1592delT) that lacked C-terminal domain had highly reduced BRCA2 binding capacity and were defective in the repair of double-strand breaks and mitomycin C-induced damages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. To date, all <italic>PALB2 </italic>gene alterations detected in families with breast cancer or FA disease were frameshift or nonsense changes, leading to the expression of a truncated protein. These data strongly support the assumption that the deletion detected in this study results in the production of an inactive protein. Silent and missense sequence variants of the <italic>PALB2 </italic>gene have been detected in previous studies in both cancer samples and in control tissues, but none of those variants have been strongly associated with cancer susceptibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>Our study proves that <italic>PALB2 </italic>alterations contribute to the familial but not to the sporadic breast cancer in Poland. This is in agreement with previous reports, in which alterations of the <italic>PALB2 </italic>gene were predominantly associated with familial breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Some authors reported <italic>PALB2 </italic>mutations also in pancreatic cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], male breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] and in a single prostate cancer family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Pancreatic cancer was mentioned at least twice in the family histories of our <italic>PALB2 </italic>mutation carriers.</p><p>The low frequency of <italic>PALB2 </italic>mutations (0.6%) observed in our study is similar to that noticed for breast cancer by other authors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Only Erkko et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] found a higher rate of mutations in the familial breast cancer: 2.7%. In their study, however, the rate of the mutations in the control population was also relatively high (0.2%). No other study except Erkko's et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and our study found <italic>PALB2 </italic>truncating mutations in control populations.</p><p>We are the first to present a <italic>PALB2 </italic>truncating mutation in a patient with medullary breast carcinoma. To date, such alterations have been detected predominantly in ductal breast carcinomas. In agreement with data presented by Heikkinen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], our study suggests that breast cancers with <italic>PALB2 </italic>mutations are predominantly triple-negative ones; however, their phenotype does not completely overlap with the basal type.</p><p>In our study, <italic>PALB</italic>2 alterations did not associate with ovarian cancer risk. In addition, the <italic>PALB2 </italic>deletion was accompanied by a germline <italic>BRCA2 </italic>nonsense mutation in one ovarian cancer patient (Moes et al., unpublished data). A similar observation was published by Heikkinen et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] who found two breast cancer patients with a <italic>PALB2 </italic>deletion among 104 <italic>BRCA2 </italic>mutation carriers. Interestingly, the presence of these two alterations in carcinomas appears to be more frequent than just one occurring by chance, considering the low frequency of <italic>PALB2 </italic>and <italic>BRCA2 </italic>mutations in control populations.</p><p>To date, <italic>PALB2 </italic>gene alterations have not been extensively studied in ovarian cancer patients. Erkko et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] found three (0.5%) ovarian cancer patients with <italic>PALB2 </italic>gene mutations in 593 unselected ovarian cancer cases screened for the <italic>PALB2 </italic>c.1592delT alteration, identified earlier in breast cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Another dysfunction of <italic>PALB2 </italic>detected in ovarian cancer was its expression silencing by promoter hypermethylation (in 4 of 53 sporadic cases) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. These studies, together with our data suggest that PALB2 protein may be defective or insufficient in some rare ovarian carcinomas; however, a possible contribution of this insufficiency to ovarian cancer development needs elucidation.</p><p>It is unclear how the PALB2 deficiency contributes to cancer development. It has been suggested that PALB2 participates in breast carcinogenesis through haploinsufficiency and/or the dominant-negative effect. In the majority of breast cancers with <italic>PALB2 </italic>gene mutations, the loss of heterozygosity (LOH) was not observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. The only evidence of deletion of the wild-type allele was presented by Garcia et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In our study, there was a suspicion of LOH at <italic>PALB2 </italic>locus in one ovarian carcinoma with <italic>PALB2 </italic>deletion. The regular allele of <italic>PALB2 </italic>gene may also be eliminated by promoter hypermethylation (as above). Such dysfunction was revealed not only in ovarian but also in sporadic breast cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Since wild-type PALB2 proteins oligomerize at damaged DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], truncated PALB2 mutants may possibly complex with wild type protein, thus, disturbing its proper function. In addition, other molecular changes may cooperate with PALB2 deficiency in cancer development.</p><p>Some of <italic>PALB2 </italic>gene alterations in breast cancer were suggested to be founder mutations for other ethnic groups [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The presence of the same deletion in seven unrelated women in our study might suggest that this was a founder mutation for the examined population from central Poland. Although the genotype analysis of the mutation carriers showed differences in the haplotypes, one cannot exclude an ancient founder mutation. More detailed analysis is necessary to determine the origin of this alteration.</p><p>Our study had some limitations. The entire coding sequence of the <italic>PALB2 </italic>gene was screened in 70 non-consecutive ovarian cancers only; the sensitivity of the SSCP ranges from 70% to 95%, according to different publications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], and it is 90% in our laboratory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Thus, some <italic>PALB2 </italic>alterations (particularly of the missense type) could have been missed. Nevertheless, a practical value of this study is that the c.509_510delGA should be searched for in Polish families with breast cancer.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The c.509_510delGA is a novel <italic>PALB2 </italic>mutation that increases the risk of familial breast cancer. Occurrence of the same <italic>PALB2 </italic>alteration in seven unrelated women suggests that c.509_510delGA (p.R170fs) is a recurrent mutation for population from Poland. It may be useful to include this <italic>PALB2 </italic>mutation to a list of alterations that should be searched for in Polish families with breast cancer.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>ADM designed and coordinated the study, carried out molecular analyses of ovarian cancers and controls, coordinated the collection of control blood samples, drafted the manuscript.
