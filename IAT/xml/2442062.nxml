We have previously reported that the stress levels of corticosterone (CORT, glucocorticoid in rat) increase expression of Fas/FasL and activate Fas/FasL signal pathway in rat Leydig cells, which consequently leads to apoptosis. Moreover, our another study showed that nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) may play a potential role in up-regulation of FasL during CORT-treated rat Leydig cell. It is not clear yet how NFAT is involved in CORT-induced up-regulation of FasL. The aim of the present study is to investigate the molecular mechanisms of NFAT-mediated FasL expression in CORT-treated Leydig cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Western blot analysis showed that NFAT2 expression is present in mouse Leydig tumor cell (mLTC-1). CORT-induced increase in FasL expression in mLTC-1 was ascertained by Western Blot analysis and CORT-induced increase in apoptotic frequency of mLTC-1 cells was detected by FACS with annexin-V labeling. Confocal imaging of NFAT2-GFP in mLTC-1 showed that high level of CORT stimulated NFAT translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. RNA interference-mediated knockdown of NFAT2 significantly attenuated CORT-induced up-regulation of FasL expression in mLTC. These results corroborated our previous finding that NFAT2 is involved in CORT-induced FasL expression in rat Leydig cells and showed that mLTC-1 is a suitable model for investigating the mechanism of CORT-induced FasL expression. The analysis of reporter constructs revealed that the sequence between -201 and +71 of mouse FasL gene is essential for CORT-induced FasL expression. The mutation analysis demonstrated that CORT-induced FasL expression is mediated via an NFAT binding element located in the -201 to +71 region. Co-transfection studies with an NFAT2 expression vector and reporter construct containing -201 to +71 region of FasL gene showed that NFAT2 confer a strong inducible activity to the FasL promoter at its regulatory region. In addition, chromatin immunoprecipitation assay further confirmed the results of reporter gene studies by showing the specific binding of NFAT2 to the -201 to +71 region.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In the present study, we demonstrated that NFAT2 directly stimulates transcription of FasL in high level CORT-treated mLTC-1. In conclusion, the present study provides further evidence for our finding that CORT-induced FasL expression in Leydig cells is mediated by NFAT.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Fas and its ligand FasL are a pair of trans-membrane proteins critically involved in apoptosis. Fas is expressed in many types of tissues, whereas FasL expression is more restricted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. FasL expression is predominantly found in activated T cells. However, its expression is also reported in and outside of the immune system, such as NK cells, macrophages and Sertoli cells in testis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>].</p><p>In male mammalian, the sexual hormone testosterone is secreted by Leydig cells in testis. We have recently demonstrated that the high levels of corticosterone (CORT, glucocorticoid in rat) that are typically achieved during stress induce apoptotic death of Leydig cells and the activation of the Fas/FasL system, cleavage of procaspase-3, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and increased ROS generation are all implicated in the process of CORT-induced Leydig cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. But the mechanism of FasL expression regulation in CORT-mediated Leydig cell apoptosis is unclear. Transcriptional regulation of FasL expression is a complicated process, which could be involved in a variety of transcriptional factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. It was known that FasL expression is dependent on nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) in T lymphocyte. In our another study, it was found that the expression of FasL was increased in 100 nM CORT-treated rat Leydig cells and the increased expression could be alleviated by NFAT inhibitor CsA. Meanwhile, Western blot analysis of NFAT protein in the cytoplasm and nuclei demonstrated that NFAT was activated by CORT treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. These results indicated that NFAT is involved in CORT-induced FasL expression in Leydig cells, but the molecular basis for this process is not clear yet. Therefore, the present study is dedicated to investigate how NFAT be involved in regulation of FasL transcription.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Analysis of NFAT2 expression in Leydig cells</title><p>To observe whether NFAT is expressed in Leydig cells, NFAT mRNA and protein expression in Leydig cells was assessed using RT-PCR and Western Blotting respectively.

The importance of these interactions has been convincingly demonstrated in murine and humans possessing loss of function mutations in either molecule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The biological importance of FasL has been highlighted recently by work demonstrating its critical role in both activation-induced cell death in T cells and in the maintenance of immune privilege within certain tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. However, relatively little is known about factors that regulate inducible expression of FasL outside of the immune system. Our previous studies established a critical role for FasL in Leydig cell via its action in CORT-induced apoptosis. We are the first to demonstrate that involvement of NFAT on regulation of FasL expression in CORT-induced Leydig cell apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. But the molecular mechanisms of NFAT-mediated up-regulation of FasL expression in CORT-induced Leydig cell apoptosis are unknown. Regulation of FasL expression is a complicated process, which could be involved in a variety of trascriptional factors including NFAT, SP1, early growth response gene (Egr) and so on. The NFAT family of transcription factors is composed of four family members NFAT1, NFAT2, NFAT3 and NFAT4, and is best known for its role in the regulation of the T cell immune response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. The principal function of NFAT in T cells is to couple stimulation of the T cell antigen receptor to changes in the expression of a number of cytokine and other immunologically important genes. NFAT are regulated primarily at the level of their subcellular localization through the actions of serine/threonine phosphatase calcineurin (CaN). In resting cells, NFAT family members are normally located in the cytoplasm in a hyperphosphorylated latent form. However, following activated CaN directly dephosphorylates NFAT proteins, nuclear import and increased intrinsic DNA binding activity occur, which could be specially inhibited by CsA. Once located in the nucleus, NFAT are then free to bind to their target promoter elements and activate the transcription of specific NFAT target genes, either alone or in combination with other nuclear partners.</p><p>This aspect of NFAT regulation is likely to be significant, since both the extent and duration of NFAT activity have recently been shown to influence the qualitative pattern of NFAT-dependent gene expression induced during T cell activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. The NFAT signaling pathway is certainly best known for its role in the regulation of the immune response. The NFAT is expressed in many cell types and contributes to diverse cellular functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. Therefore, it has become increasingly apparent that this pathway also plays an important role in the regulation of a wide variety of cellular responses in a number of other tissues.</p><p>Our recent study had verified that NFAT was involved in CORT-induced expression of FasL in rat Leydig cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Owing to relatively little is known about NFAT regulation of FasL expression outside of the immune system, no doubt, it is very interesting to observe whether NFAT regulate FasL expression through affection FasL promotor activation in CORT-treated Leydig cells.</p><p>In the present study, mLTC-1 were selected as cell model due to its suitability for transfection. Although it is widely accepted that mLTC-1 is a favorable model for study on biology of Leydig cells, we validated firstly that CORT-induced up-regulation of FasL expression is also present in mLTC-1 by RT-PCR and Western blotting analysis. Western blotting analysis showed NFAT2 is the predominant isoform in mLTC. However, other members of NFAT family, i. e. NFAT1, NFAT3 and NFAT4 exprssion is very low compared to NFAT2 in mLTC-1 (our unpublished data). It was also shown that NFAT2-GFP chimeric protein translocated from cytoplasm to nuclus after CORT treatment and siRNA-mediated silencing of NFAT decreased the extent of CORT-induced FasL expression. These results were in accord with our finding in rat Leydig cells, i.e. high level CORT activates Fas/FasL signal pathway through activation of NFAT.</p><p>Previous studies from other investigators suggested the presence of multiple elements at -689 bp at 5' untranslated region of FasL promoter, which is capable of enhancing transcriptional activity of the FasL promoter in T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Furthermore, we predicated the transcription start site and transcription factor binding sites on FasL promoter by analyzing the sequence of FasL 5' untranslated region through online-based computer program. Based on these messages, the -689 bp at 5' untranslated region of FasL promoter was selected as an object to observe NFAT regulation of FasL promoter activity in present study. In order to elucidate the mechanism of CORT-triggered up-regulation of FasL expression in CORT-treated Leydig cells, we cloned -689 bp (-618- +71) at 5' untranslated region of FasL promoter and found that the -618- +71 region is available and sufficient for further establishment of mechanisms of NFAT-triggered FasL expression in CORT-treated Leydig cells.</p><p>The data presented in this paper firstly suggested that activity of FasL promoter (at -689 bp sequences) was enhanced in CORT-treated mLTC. To establish the minimal function region on FasL promoter which is interaction with NFAT, we synthesized a series of 5' deletion constructs and tested their transcriptional activities in response to CORT treatment. It was firstly found the presence of a high active site situated between -201- +71 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F8">8</xref>). Our present data showed that there are two NFAT binding sites between -201-+71 region (with total 272 bp) and only one NFAT binding site between -167-+71 region (with total 238 bp). The 272 bp showed the maximal activation in whole FasL promotor sequences. Latinis et al. reported that the binding of NFAT to the GGAAA site on FasL active core sequence is critical for triggering FasL promoter activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. So this specific short sequence was selected as mutated site in present experiment. It was found that the mutated sequence significantly resulted in an inhibition of FasL promoter activity following the nucleotides sequence was mutated. Finally, co-transfection experiments with the NFAT expression vector and FasL promoter with report gene further showed that NFAT enhanced transcriptional activity of FasL promoter by interaction with its -272 bp DNA sequence, thereby regulating FasL promoter activity in CORT-treated Leydig cells. In addition, mutation at -272 bp DNA sequence also resulted in an inhibition of transcriptional activity of FasL promoter in co-transfection experiments. Furthermore, the ChIP result further confirms that NFAT directly bind to FasL promoter sequence in vivo.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our present findings provide further insight into the mechanisms involved on the regulation of the FasL expression in response to CORT treatment in Leydig cells. In summary, the mechanisms of transcriptional regulation of FasL expression in CORT-treated mLTC-1 is an activation on transcription factor NFAT. The active transcription factor interact with specific NFAT target genes in FasL promoter sequence at -201 to +71 region, thereby regulating FasL expression.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cells and reagents</title><p>Cell line mLTC-1 (mouse Leydig tumor cell) was purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Cat.
