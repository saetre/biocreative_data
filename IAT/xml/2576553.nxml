We studied the GTN-induced inactivation of ALDH2 by UV/visible absorption spectroscopy. Dehydrogenation of acetaldehyde and hydrolysis of <italic>p</italic>-nitrophenylacetate (<italic>p</italic>-NPA) were both inhibited by GTN. The rate of inhibition increased with the GTN concentration and decreased with the substrate concentration, indicative of competition between GTN and the substrates. Inactivation of <italic>p</italic>-NPA hydrolysis was greatly enhanced in the presence of NAD<sup>+</sup>, and, to a lesser extent, in the presence of NADH. In the presence of dithiothreitol (DTT) inactivation of ALDH2 was much slower. Dihydrolipoic acid (LPA-H<sub>2</sub>) was less effective than DTT, whereas glutathione, cysteine, and ascorbate did not protect against inactivation. When DTT was added after complete inactivation, dehydrogenase reactivation was quite modest (&#x02264;16%). The restored dehydrogenase activity correlated inversely with the GTN concentration but was hardly affected by the concentrations of acetaldehyde or DTT. Partial reactivation of dehydrogenation was also accomplished by LPA-H<sub>2</sub> but not by GSH. We conclude that, in addition to the previously documented reversible inhibition by GTN that can be ascribed to the oxidation of the active site thiol, there is an irreversible component to ALDH inactivation. Importantly, ALDH2-catalyzed GTN reduction was partly inactivated by preincubation with GTN, suggesting that the inactivation of GTN reduction is also partly irreversible. These observations are consistent with a significant role for irreversible inactivation of ALDH2 in the development of nitrate tolerance.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><label>*</label><p>This work was supported by the <grant-sponsor>Fonds zur F&#x000f6;rderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung in &#x000d6;sterreich</grant-sponsor> (W901 DK Molecular Enzymology and P20669 to B.

GTN is thought to cause vasodilatation mainly by activation of soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC), which is stimulated by the binding of NO to a regulatory heme group. Because GTN does not release NO spontaneously, it requires bioconversion. GTN activates sGC non-enzymatically in the presence of cysteine and a few structurally related thiols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>) via NO release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>). At sufficiently high concentrations, ascorbate can substitute for Cys in the activation of GTN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>). Although thiol- or ascorbate-supported decomposition of GTN might account for its biological effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>), bioconversion of GTN is probably largely enzymatic, and a number of mechanisms, featuring different enzymes, have been put forward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>). A recent proposal suggests a crucial role for the mitochondrial isoform of aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH2) in the transformation of GTN to 1,2-glyceryl dinitrate (1,2-GDN) and nitrite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>). Because the active site thiol of ALDH2 is oxidized in the process, it must be regenerated by suitable reductants, which might explain the dependence of GTN bioconversion on the presence of thiols. One major unresolved question concerns the identity of the physiological reductant, because ALDH2-catalyzed GTN reduction is supported by the non-physiological thiol dithiothreitol (DTT) but not by glutathione (GSH), the most abundant physiological low-molecular weight thiol. A second problem adhering the hypothesis originates from the fact that the reaction produces nitrite rather than NO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>); it has been proposed that the ability of mitochondria to convert nitrite to nitric oxide or <italic>S</italic>-nitrosothiols provides the link between ALDH2-catalyzed GTN metabolism and vasodilatation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>). Interestingly, activation of sGC by GTN has been accomplished in the presence of purified mitochondrial ALDH2, suggesting that the ALDH2-catalyzed decomposition of GTN yields NO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>); the physiological relevance of this observation is not clear yet.</p><p>Chronic application of GTN is severely hampered by the phenomenon of nitrate tolerance. Nitrate tolerance appears to be a multicause phenomenon, and numerous explanations for its occurrence have been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>). One attractive characteristic of the proposal that mitochondrial ALDH is responsible for GTN biotransformation is the fact that it can accommodate one of the more common explanations for nitrate tolerance in a slightly modified version. In view of the thiol dependence of GTN, it was suspected that thiol depletion might contribute to nitrate tolerance. The realization that each turnover with GTN requires regeneration of the active site thiol of ALDH2 by an exogenous reductant revitalized this hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>). Accordingly, nitrate tolerance develops when regeneration of active ALDH2 fails, either because the unidentified cellular reductant runs low, or because a putative enzyme involved in the process is inactivated. In the present paper we investigated the inactivation of ALDH2 by GTN in the presence and absence of thiols to elucidate this issue.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES</title><p><italic>Materials</italic>&#x02014;Recombinant human ALDH2 was expressed in and purified from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>). GTN (Nitropohl&#x000ae; ampoules; G. Pohl-Boskamp GmbH &#x00026; Co, Hohenlockstedt Germany) was obtained from a local pharmacy as a 1 mg/ml aqueous isotonic solution, containing 49 mg/ml glucose monohydrate, and diluted in 50 m<sc>m</sc> triethanolamine/HCl (pH 7.4). [2-<sup>14</sup>C]GTN (50 mCi/mmol), manufactured by American Radiolabeled Chemicals, was supplied locally by Humos Diagnostica (Maria Enzersdorf, Austria). 1,2-GDN and 1,3-GDN, used as standards in radio-thin layer chromatography, were obtained from LGC Promochem (Wesel, Germany). 6-Methoxy-2-naphthaldehyde (Monal 62, 98%) was obtained from Sigma. Naphthoic acid was purchased from ABCR GmbH &#x00026; Co KG (Karlsruhe, Germany). All other chemicals were from Sigma or Merck (Darmstadt, Germany).</p><p><italic>Determination of the Inactivation Kinetics</italic>&#x02014;To determine the rate of inactivation of ALDH2 by GTN, the optical absorption of a 1-cm quartz cuvette (type 105.200-QS, Hellma, M&#x000fc;llheim, Germany) containing substrate (acetaldehyde or <italic>p</italic>-NPA) and additional compounds like NAD<sup>+</sup> or DTT as indicated in 50 m<sc>m</sc> potassium P<sub>i</sub> (pH 7.4), was monitored at 340 (dehydrogenase) or 400 nm (esterase) in a Hewlett-Packard 8452A Diode Array spectrophotometer. After &#x0223c;1&#x02013;2 min ALDH2 was added and the reaction was allowed to proceed for &#x0223c;2&#x02013;3 min. Subsequently, GTN (or in some instances NAD<sup>+</sup>) was added to start the inactivation. Usually, when inactivation was complete, DTT, substrate, or both were added to reactivate the enzyme. The total volume of the samples after GTN addition was 250 &#x003bc;l. The total time over which the reaction was monitored was 20&#x02013;30 min. Although new conditions were always explored with a single sample for optimal time resolution, concentration dependences or variations of cofactor or reductant (see &#x0201c;Results&#x0201d;) were usually studied with up to 6 samples per experiment with the 89073A multicell transport accessory. The temperature of the samples was kept at 20 &#x000b0;C by a refrigerating circulating water bath (Lauda RM6, Bartelt GmbH, Austria). The various segments of the time traces (initial activity, restored activities) were fitted linearly, except for the inactivation, which was fitted to a combination of a single-exponential and a straight line. The linear component yielded the residual activity; the exponential component yielded the apparent inactivation rate constant, as can be derived as follows: if the uninhibited activity is <italic>v<sub>e</sub></italic> = <italic>k<sub>e</sub></italic>&#x000b7;<italic>E</italic>, with <italic>k<sub>e</sub></italic> and <italic>E</italic> representing the catalytic rate constant and the enzyme concentration, respectively, inactivation will lower the activity by decreasing the catalytically competent enzyme fraction in a mono-exponential fashion with <italic>E<sub>t</sub></italic> = <italic>E</italic><sub>0</sub>&#x000b7;<italic>e<sup>-k<sub>i</sub></sup></italic><sup>t</sup>, in which <italic>E</italic><sub>0</sub> is the total enzyme concentration and <italic>k<sub>i</sub></italic> is the apparent inactivation rate constant.

It illustrates how the linear increase of the NADH concentration is gradually reduced to a very low residual level. Fitting the curve corresponding to this process to a single exponential yielded a first-order rate constant that can be equated to the apparent inactivation rate constant under this particular set of conditions (see &#x0201c;Experimental Procedures&#x0201d;). Attempts to reactivate the enzyme by DTT resulted in modest restoration of activity. The magnitude of reactivation was not affected by the concentrations of DTT (between 0.2 and 2 m<sc>m</sc>) and acetaldehyde (up to 2 m<sc>m</sc>).</p><p>The rate of inactivation increased when the GTN concentration was raised. For instance, at a fixed concentration of 0.43 m<sc>m</sc> acetaldehyde the inactivation rate constant increased from 2.96 &#x000b1; 0.08 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-3</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> at 0.05 m<sc>m</sc> GTN to 21.1 &#x000b1; 0.5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-3</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> at 0.6 m<sc>m</sc> GTN. By contrast, inactivation slowed down at higher acetaldehyde concentrations: at a fixed concentration of 0.5 m<sc>m</sc> GTN the rate constant decreased from 23 &#x000b1; 5 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-3</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> at 0.1 m<sc>m</sc> acetaldehyde to 2.9 &#x000b1; 0.3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-3</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> at 20 m<sc>m</sc> acetaldehyde. The latter observation is indicative of competition between acetaldehyde and GTN.

Interestingly, inhibition of GTN reduction by ALDH2 also required more than 1000-fold higher concentrations of acetaldehyde than might have been expected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>).

Because our results suggest that the phenomenon persists in the presence of NAD<sup>+</sup>, an alternative explanation seems to be required. It has been debated whether the dehydrogenase and esterase reactions take place at the same site. This matter appears settled now, with convincing evidence in favor of a single active site, although some of the earlier data that suggested a 2-site model remain unexplained (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref28">28</xref>). To accommodate the disparate observations, we propose that all substrates react in the same active site pocket, but that the unnatural esterase substrates and GTN can occupy any of a number of poorly defined low-affinity positions, whereas the dehydrogenase substrates can and must be bound to a strictly defined high-affinity site to enable hydride transfer (supplementary materials Scheme S1).</p><p>Somewhat surprisingly, NAD<sup>+</sup> profoundly affected the rate of inactivation of the esterase reaction by GTN. In the presence of DTT, inactivation was negligible unless NAD<sup>+</sup> was present as well. A substantial decrease of the dissociation constant for GTN in the presence of NAD<sup>+</sup> seems to be an implausible explanation.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn6">4</xref> It is more likely that NAD<sup>+</sup> binding exposes a target to GTN that is poorly accessible in the absence of the cofactor.</p><p><italic>Protection and Restoration of the Dehydrogenase Reaction by Thiols</italic>&#x02014;The inhibition of mitochondrial ALDH by isosorbide dinitrate is completely reversed by &#x003b2;-ME (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>). Inhibition of yeast ALDH by NO was almost completely prevented and largely reversed by DTT, whereas &#x003b2;-ME and GSH were less efficient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>). Mitochondrial ALDH was partially protected against GTN-induced inactivation by DTT and LPA-H<sub>2</sub>, but not by GSH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>). It has been demonstrated that the conversion of GTN to 1,2-GDN by mitochondrial ALDH requires the presence of a reducing agent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>). The highest activity was observed in the presence of DTT, whereas LPA-H<sub>2</sub> was about half as effective; activity was low in the presence of Cys and &#x003b2;-ME and virtually absent in the presence of GSH. In line with these reports, we found that DTT and LPA-H<sub>2</sub>, but not Cys or GSH, protected dehydrogenation against GTN-induced inhibition. Accordingly, inactivation of ALDH2 seems to be due to the oxidation and subsequent disulfide formation of an essential cysteine residue. The poorer performance of GSH compared with DTT has been ascribed to a combination of the lower redox potential of DTT and the presence of two thiol groups per molecule, which gives DTT a kinetic advantage over GSH (and &#x003b2;-ME) in achieving complete reduction of the disulfide bridge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>). The same arguments hold for LPA-H<sub>2</sub> as well.</p><p>When DTT was added to the enzyme after complete inactivation by GTN, the thiol could only rescue a minor fraction of dehydrogenase activity, suggesting that at that time most of the enzyme was no longer present as a disulfide. Both residual and thiol-restored activities diminished when the GTN concentration was increased. This might suggest that the magnitude of residual and restored activity is determined by competition between GTN and substrate; however, the acetaldehyde concentration hardly affected either activity. Conceivably, the GTN concentration could also modulate restored activity by competition with DTT, because the GTN to DTT ratio might affect the steady-state levels of the inactive and active ALDH2 species in a reaction cycle involving oxidation/inactivation by GTN and reduction/reactivation by DTT. However, the DTT concentration also did not affect restored activity. We propose that, in addition to the DTT-reversible oxidation of the active site cysteine by GTN, the oxidized cysteinyl and/or some other active site residues may engage in a secondary reaction with GTN to yield an enzyme species that does not support dehydrogenation and is not reduced by DTT.</p><p><xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Scheme 1</xref> shows a simple model for GTN-induced inactivation that accommodates most of the observations, particularly the observations that (i) irreversible inhibition in the absence of DTT is only partial and (ii) the extent of irreversible inhibition increases with the GTN concentration. Accordingly, partitioning between reversible and irreversible inhibition in the absence of a reductant will depend on the ratio of the rates of disulfide formation (<italic>k</italic><sub>rev</sub>) and irreversible inactivation (<italic>k</italic><sub>irr</sub>&#x000b7;[GTN]), the latter of which depends on the GTN concentration. In the presence of a reductant (<italic>e.g.</italic> DTT), reversible inactivation will be abolished by regeneration of the active enzyme state (<italic>E</italic><sub>SH</sub>) from the disulfide species (<italic>E</italic><sub>S-S</sub>), and irreversible inhibition will be slowed down by the DTT-induced reduction of the oxidized thiol species (<italic>E</italic><sub>S</sub>&#x000b7;). The model correctly predicts that the fraction of ALDH2 that is irreversibly inactivated by GTN in the absence of DTT will depend on the GTN concentration but not on the concentrations of DTT and acetaldehyde applied to reactivate the enzyme.</p><p><fig position="float" id="fig9"><label>SCHEME 1.</label><caption><p><bold>Irreversible inactivation of ALDH-catalyzed GTN reduction.</bold> Under low turnover conditions ([GTN], [DTT] &#x0003c;&#x0003c; <italic>Km</italic><sup>GTN</sup>, <italic>Km</italic><sup>DTT</sup>), the enzyme cycles between the reduced thiol/thiolate, oxidized thiyl, and oxidized disulfide states.

Note that because of the branching of the reaction after thiol oxidation, irreversible inactivation in the absence of DTT will only be partial, with the extent depending on the concentration of GTN. Inactivation will be slower in the presence of DTT but, on account of the continuous recycling of the disulfide to the active reduced thiol, all of the enzyme should eventually be inactivated irreversibly.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="zbc048085644s001"></graphic></fig></p><p>As a rather trivial alternative explanation for the dependence of the extent of irreversible inactivation on the concentration of GTN, one could assume that GTN or one of its metabolites is inactivating the enzyme in a totally unrelated reaction. Although such a reaction would be expected to affect the rate rather than the extent of irreversible inactivation, it might explain the observations of <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>, provided the reaction is slow and the time of GTN and DTT additions did not vary much between experiments. To investigate that possibility we performed the experiments illustrated by Figs. <xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">6</xref> and supplemental S7, in which we varied the time between GTN and DTT addition. The results indicated that most of the activity was lost within the same time frame in which GTN inhibited the enzyme (in the absence of DTT), in agreement with the mechanism-based model of inactivation presented in <xref rid="fig9" ref-type="fig">Scheme 1</xref>.</p><p>Although a slower reaction was also apparent, it did not depend on the GTN concentration and also occurred in the absence of GTN, suggesting that it represents unspecific deterioration of the enzyme upon prolonged incubation. In the preincubation experiments (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Fig. 6</xref>) we made the observation that, although DTT protected the enzyme against inactivation in the absence of GTN, it exacerbated the inactivation in its presence. Although paradoxical at first sight, this observation is in line with expectations for the mechanism-based model of irreversible inactivation proposed by us. In the absence of DTT, the enzyme undergoes only one turnover in the presence of GTN, and mechanism-based inactivation will be halted after that. In the presence of DTT, multiple turnovers with GTN will occur, which will result in complete inactivation, even if DTT diminishes the fraction of irreversibly inactivated enzyme per turnover. Taken together, these results provide strong support for mechanism-based inactivation as the origin of irreversible inactivation.</p><p>The strictly kinetic nature of the present study precludes conclusions about the site or identity of the structural changes underlying the inactivation processes, although the literature may offer some clues. A secondary reaction, in which GTN or one of its metabolites reacts with an oxidized or nitrated thiol before generation of the disulfide can occur, might result in irreversible formation of thiol sulfinate and sulfonate products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>). One candidate inactivating agent is nitroxyl (NO<sup>-</sup>), which has been proposed to be a product of GTN metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>), and which was reported to cause partially irreversible inhibition of ALDH, presumably by the formation of sulfinamides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>). Another interesting possibility is that NO is produced in the inactivation process. GTN can stimulate sGC in the presence of purified ALDH2, and this stimulation is mediated by NO even though the proposed mechanism for ALDH-supported decomposition of GTN predicts nitrite as the only product (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>). Formation of NO in the secondary reaction occurring at higher GTN concentrations might explain those observations. Additional structural studies will be necessary to resolve these issues. We are currently carrying out mass spectrometric studies with wild-type ALDH2 and several active site mutants to this end.</p><p><italic>Physiological Implications</italic>&#x02014;Nitrate tolerance is a complex and almost certainly multifactorial phenomenon, with potential contributions from impaired bioactivation, oxidative stress, sGC desensitization, and physiological counter-regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>). The role of impaired GTN bioactivation depends on the physiologically relevant mechanism of GTN biotransformation. Because decomposition of GTN by ALDH2 results in oxidation of the active site thiol that must subsequently be reduced to sustain catalysis, the proposed involvement of ALDH2 in the bioactivation of GTN revived the early proposal that ascribed nitrate tolerance to thiol depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>). However, whereas the mechanism of bioactivation involves reversible thiol oxidation, an irreversible or slowly reversible process must underlie nitrate tolerance. The irreversible inhibition reported in the present study may, therefore, contribute to nitrate tolerance <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>In the absence of DTT the rate of irreversible inactivation can be estimated from the observed inactivation rates (reversible + irreversible) and the relative activity after reactivation. Analysis of supplemental Fig. S1 yields an apparent inhibition rate constant of 3 &#x000d7; 10<sup>2</sup><sc>m</sc><sup>-1</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> with a limit of 0.04&#x02013;0.06 s<sup>-1</sup>. According to Figs. <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> and <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> a large fraction of the inactivation (&#x02265;70%) will be irreversible, suggesting that the rate constant for irreversible inactivation is of similar magnitude. For GTN concentrations in the physiological range (0.01&#x02013;0.1 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc>) this would result in lifetimes for active ALDH2 between 6 and 60 h. For the inactivation in the presence of DTT a rate constant of &#x0223c;4 &#x000d7; 10<sup>-4</sup> s<sup>-1</sup> can be derived (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>), but this rate corresponds to saturating concentrations of GTN and DTT and cannot be easily extrapolated to physiologically relevant levels. Moreover, the present model does not account for the small but significant fraction of irreversible inhibition (&#x0223c;7%) that seems to be refractory to DTT (Fig. S2).<sup>3</sup></p><p>A crucial question regarding the physiological significance of irreversible ALDH2 inactivation concerns the applicability of the observations to GTN reduction. The results presented in <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7</xref> suggest that GTN reduction behaves like aldehyde dehydrogenation in this respect. In the absence of DTT the enzyme turned over only once and after recovery no more GTN was reduced, in line with the hypothesis that the reaction with GTN results in oxidation of the active site thiol. In the same time frame the enzyme underwent multiple turnovers (5.35 times) in the presence of DTT. However, activity diminished by 33 and 51% after preincubation with 2 &#x003bc;<sc>m</sc> GTN in the absence and presence of DTT, respectively. Considering that, during preincubation in the presence of DTT, ALDH2 underwent 5.35 turnovers on average, the 51% inhibition after recovery corresponds to a loss of active enzyme of 12.5% per turnover. Comparison with the 33% inhibition during one turnover in the absence of DTT indicates that DTT provides partial protection against irreversible inactivation by GTN. These results agree qualitatively with those for dehydrogenation.</p><p>The central observation of the present paper is that in addition to the previously noticed thiol-reversible inhibition, there is an irreversible aspect to the inactivation of ALDH2 by GTN. This irreversible component, which affects dehydrogenase activity as well as GTN reductase activity, may contribute to the phenomenon of nitrate tolerance. In line with this hypothesis, thiols are often unable to reverse nitrate tolerance completely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>). In summary, the present study allows the following conclusions: (i) in the absence of DTT, GTN oxidizes the active site thiol of mitochondrial ALDH resulting in complete inactivation of dehydrogenation, ester hydrolysis, and GTN reduction; (ii) the rate of inactivation is affected by the concentrations of substrate and inhibitor, indicative of competitive binding, but the apparent dissociation constants (in the order of 10<sup>-4</sup><sc>m</sc>) are much higher than reported <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> values for the respective reactions, which suggests that competition takes place outside of the high-affinity binding site; (iii) dehydrogenase activity is only restored to a modest extent by DTT, indicating that a large fraction of inactivation is irreversible; (iv) GTN reduction is irreversibly inactivated in a similar fashion as dehydrogenase activity, suggesting a role for irreversible ALDH2 inactivation in the development of nitrate tolerance.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="PMC_1" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>[Supplemental Data]</title></caption><media mimetype="text" mime-subtype="html" xlink:href="M804001200_index.html"/><media xlink:role="associated-file" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="M804001200_1.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><citation citation-type="journal">Ignarro, L.
