Two subpathways of NER exist: (i) the global genome repair pathway and (ii) the transcription-coupled repair (TCR) pathway, and TCR is an important factor in Cockayne syndrome (CS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg164c1">1</xref>). CS is a premature aging syndrome with complex symptoms, including developmental abnormalities, neurologic dysfunction and short average life span. Cellular characteristics include hypersensitivity to UV light, and failure of RNA synthesis to recover to normal rates following UV irradiation. Two genes have been shown to be involved: <italic>CSA</italic> and <italic>CSB</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg164c2">2</xref>). The 168 kDa CS group B (CSB) protein contains an acidic amino acid stretch, a glycine-rich region, two putative nuclear localization signal (NLS) sequences, and seven conserved ATPase motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg164c3">3</xref>). Members of the SNF2-like family of DNA-dependent ATPases, including CSB, contain seven characteristic motifs, I, Ia and II&#x02013;VI, that are also present in DNA and RNA helicases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg164c4">4</xref>). Helicase activity has not been demonstrated for any members of the SNF2-like family, which is part of Superfamily 2 (SF2), but in general they have the ability to destabilize protein&#x02013;DNA interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg164c5">5</xref>). The CSB protein displays DNA-dependent ATPase activity, which is better stimulated by double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) than single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg164c6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg164c8">8</xref>), and CSB is able to remodel chromatin <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg164c9">9</xref>).</p><p>So far, only helicases, and thus no proteins of the SNF2-like family, have been crystallized. However, structures derived from the crystallized SF1 helicases Rep and PcrA reveal striking similarity to the distantly related SF2 RNA helicase NS3, and the seven conserved helicase motifs form a nucleotide binding (NTB) pocket (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg164c10">10</xref>). In particular, the conserved aspartate and glutamate residues of motif II (Walker B) coordinate the Mg<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> ion and probably also the attacking water molecule during ATP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg164c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg164c12">12</xref>). Motif V seems to contact the oligonucleotide, while motif VI is directly or indirectly involved in NTP binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg164c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg164c12">12</xref>).</p><p>The integrity of the SNF2-like ATPase domain is critical for most functions of CSB <italic>in vivo</italic>. <italic>CSB</italic> cDNA with point mutations in motifs Ia, II, III, V and VI, as opposed to wild-type (wt) <italic>CSB</italic> cDNA, do not complement the deficiencies of the SV40-transformed CS-B cell line, CS1AN.S3.G2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg164c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg164c14">14</xref>). In contrast, both a deletion of the acidic region and a point mutation in a putative NTB motif do not interfere with the ability of CSB to complement CSB-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg164c14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg164c16">16</xref>).</p><p>CS-B cells and cell extracts are generally deficient in incision at 8-oxoguanine (8-oxoG) and 8-oxoadenine lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg164c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg164c17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg164c19">19</xref>). The reduced 8-oxoG activity can be complemented by transfection with wt <italic>CSB</italic> and partially complemented by motif II (E646Q) mutant cDNA, but not with motif V (T912&#x0002f;913V) or VI (Q942E) CSB mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg164c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg164c20">20</xref>). Furthermore, the 8-oxoG repair capacity of wt and mutant transfected cells correlates with mRNA and protein levels of the 8-oxoG DNA glycosylase (OGG1) responsible for the removal of 8-oxoG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg164c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg164c18">18</xref>). This suggests that the general base excision repair (BER) defect is associated with a subtle transcription deficiency, and that wt and motif II but not motif V and VI mutant CSB proteins are able to support efficient OGG1 expression. There also appears to be a functional interaction between OGG1 and CSB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg164c21">21</xref>). To better understand the biological functions of the mutant CSB proteins, we report here the functional analysis of purified, recombinant CSB wt and motif II, V and VI mutant proteins. We find that the ATPase activity of the motif II CSB mutant is nearly abolished whereas motif V and VI mutant proteins retain residual catalytic activity. DNA binding of CSB mutant proteins is similar to the CSB wt protein. The motif V and VI mutant proteins show slightly reduced ATP binding while the motif II mutant protein exhibits increased ATP binding. Also, CSB wt and mutant protein tagged with enhanced cyano fluorescent protein (ECFP) all display homogenous nuclear distribution. These results suggest that deficiencies in functions other than DNA binding or DNA-stimulated ATP hydrolysis detected <italic>in vitro</italic> may be responsible for the defects of CS-B null cell lines transfected with either motif V or motif VI <italic>CSB</italic> mutant genes. Furthermore, CSB wt ATPase activity was studied with different biologically important DNA cofactors, and the results indicate that the CSB wt ATPase activity is maximally stimulated by DNA substrates containing a small loop or bubble.</p><p>Although the CSB protein is involved in RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) elongation, it does not affect the transcription of all genes, suggesting that the activity of the CSB protein is regulated <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg164c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg164c22">22</xref>). Control of phosphorylation status is an important factor in both transcription and repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg164c23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg164c25">25</xref>), and phosphorylation affects subcellular localization as well as activity of different members of the SNF2 family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg164c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg164c27">27</xref>). Phosphorylation of target proteins is an integral part of the DNA damage response, and the p53 protein, which interacts with CSB, is phosphorylated in response to DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg164c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg164c29">29</xref>). The extent of phosphorylation of the CSB protein has not previously been investigated and we were interested in this parameter and, particularly, how phosphorylation status might affect its activities and how it might change during DNA repair. Here we present evidence that CSB activity is controlled by phosphorylation. Notably, we document that CSB ATPase activity is stimulated by dephosphorylation, and that UV irradiation results in dephosphorylation of CSB <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Plasmid constructs</title><p>CSB wt containing an N-terminal hemagglutinin antigen (HA) epitope and a C-terminal histidine (His<sub>6</sub>) cloned in the pFASTBAC vector, pFB-CSBwt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg164c8">8</xref>), was kindly provided by Alan Lehmann.

CSB cDNA containing any of these mutations, in contrast to wt CSB, cannot complement most of the defects of CS1AN.S3.G2 cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg164f1">1</xref>B) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg164c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg164c20">20</xref>). Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg164f2">2</xref>A shows that the CSB wt and CSB mutant proteins were of similar purity as seen by silver staining, and had the expected size of &#x0223c;168 kDa. The introduced mutations are minor conserved substitutions, which are not expected to exhibit significant structural perturbations. We observed that CSB wt and mutant proteins showed the same behavior in solution and during chromatography and aggregated at high concentrations in solution.</p><p>The CSB protein is a DNA-stimulated ATPase, with preference for dsDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg164c8">8</xref>), and CSB wt protein purified in our laboratory showed the same behavior (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg164f2">2</xref>B). A single-stranded pre-melted 60mer stimulated the CSB ATPase activity weakly when compared to a double-stranded 60mer or plasmid DNA, whereas very little or no activity was seen with a (dT)<sub>16</sub> oligonucleotide or no DNA. In all subsequent ATPase assays, 50 &#x000b5;M cold ATP was included to keep the ATP hydrolysis below 20&#x00025; and thereby allow activity determinations. The CSB ATPase shows a clear dose response upon addition of increasing amounts of pUC19 cofactor DNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg164f2">2</xref>C). CSB ATPase activity showed a plateau above 50 ng of pUC19 DNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg164f2">2</xref>C). Thus, to ensure that the ATPase activity is not limited by availability of cofactor DNA, 150 ng of DNA was used in subsequent reactions. Lineweaver&#x02013;Burke analysis of the data yielded a <italic>K</italic><sub>effector</sub> value for pUC19 DNA of 3.1 &#x000b1; 0.9 nM (55 &#x000b1; 16 ng).</p><p>The extent of ATP hydrolysis was observed to be proportional to the amount of CSB wt present (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg164f3">3</xref>). The conservative substitution E646Q in motif II of the SNF2-like domain resulted in complete abolishment of the ATPase function of the protein. In contrast, it was seen that the two other conservative substitutions T912&#x0002f;913V and Q942E in motifs V and VI, respectively, retained a low level of ATPase activity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg164f3">3</xref>). Since the CSB wt and mutant proteins were purified by the same procedure and are at a similar level of purity and concentration (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg164f2">2</xref>A), the ATPase activity is not due to any contaminating species, but is a property of the purified proteins. Furthermore, we performed simultaneous analysis of the specific activity, purity of CSB wt and mutant proteins, and the amount of CSB present in the flow-through, wash and different fractions of both the Ni<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup>&#x02013;nitriloacetic acid&#x02013;agarose column and the heparin column. This analysis showed that the differences in activity are not due to loss of active enzyme during the purification procedure (data not shown). The protein titrations are also consistent with an impairment of ATPase activity of the mutant proteins, and even large quantities of mutant enzyme, compared to wt, do not overcome the deficiency.</p><p><italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> was calculated in five independent experiments with constant protein concentration, supercoiled pUC19 plasmid and an ATP concentration ranging from 5 to 100 &#x000b5;M.

CSBQ942E has a 4.6-fold increase in <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> accompanied by a 3.8-fold decrease in <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> compared to CSB wt protein. The CSBT912&#x0002f;913V protein has a 9.2-fold increase in <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> and, as the CSBQ942E protein, a 3.8-fold reduction in <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> when compared to CSB wt. These data indicate that mutations of conserved residues in motifs V and VI impair ATP binding as well as ATP hydrolysis itself.</p><p>In addition to the ATPase activity, we also examined ATP and DNA binding of the different mutant CSB proteins, using a nitrocellulose filter-binding assay. In support of the kinetic data, ATP binding of the motif V and VI mutants was reduced compared to the CSB wt protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg164f4">4</xref>, data are normalized against ATP binding of 25 nM CSB wt protein). In contrast, the motif II mutant exhibited increased ATP binding compared to CSB wt protein (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg164f4">4</xref>). The DNA binding analysis showed that CSB wt protein exhibited DNA binding in the absence of nucleotide and reduced DNA binding in the presence of ADP or the weakly hydrolyzable ATP analog ATP&#x003b3;S (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg164f5">5</xref>A). To determine the apparent dissociation constant, the data were analyzed by a Hill plot. In the absence of nucleotide, <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> was 0.27 mM, while the presence of ATP&#x003b3;S increased <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> to 1.5 mM. In the presence of ADP, <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> was found to be 2.9 mM. Purified CSB mutant proteins all exhibited DNA binding with <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> at wt levels both in the absence (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg164f5">5</xref>B) and presence of nucleotide (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Localization of CSB wt and mutant proteins</title><p>To determine whether differences in <italic>in vivo</italic> complementation data could be attributed to a deficiency in subcellular localization, which may arise as a result of misfolding due to the amino acid substitutions, CSB wt and mutant proteins were tagged with ECFP and expressed in CS1AN.S3.G2 cells. The analysis showed that ECFP alone localized all over the cell, whereas the CSB wt-ECFP fusion protein localized to the nucleus and rescued the CS1AN cells from UV sensitivity (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg164f6">6</xref>, and data not shown). ECFP fusions with the three different mutants also showed predominant nuclear localization (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg164f6">6</xref>). The tagged CSB proteins were homogeneously distributed in the nucleus with &#x0223c;20&#x00025; of the cells showing additional brighter fluorescent foci.</p></sec><sec><title>CSB ATPase activity dependence on secondary structures of the DNA cofactor and on substrates containing DNA damage</title><p>It was next investigated whether CSB ATPase activity is affected by cofactor DNA substrates with different secondary structure related to NER or transcription arrest (bubble of 15 nt), or transcription elongation (bubble of 35 nt) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg164c36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg164c37">37</xref>). The structures tested are shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkg164tb1">1</xref>. Interestingly, the ATPase activity was significantly increased (1.6-fold) with DNA cofactor substrates containing a loop of 16 thymines and with bubble substrates containing 15 thymines in the bubble (loop and b15 in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg164f7">7</xref>A). In contrast, cofactor DNA containing double-strand (ds) to single-strand (ss) transitions in non-rigid structures &#x0005b;ds&#x02013;ss and splayed arm (sa) and a bubble of 35 thymines (b35)&#x0005d; did not increase the CSB ATPase activity significantly above that of a double-stranded 31mer. To test if DNA damage directly can stimulate the CSB ATPase, pUC19 plasmid DNA was damaged by UV irradiation, photoactivated MB, cisplatin or MMS. No damaged DNA had an effect, yet a consistent, but statistically insignificant, stimulation was observed with cisplatin-treated DNA (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg164f7">7</xref>B). Since the activity of other SNF2-like family members is affected by the presence of interacting proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg164c5">5</xref>), we also investigated whether CSB ATPase activity was influenced by some of its known interaction partners. However, neither XPA nor p53 had any effect on CSB ATPase activity (data not shown).</p></sec><sec><title>Phosphorylation of the CSB protein <italic>in vitro</italic></title><p>When the <italic>CSB</italic> gene was first cloned, it was reported to harbor two putative CKII serine phosphorylation sites in the vicinity of putative NLSs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg164c3">3</xref>). It has not previously been shown whether CSB is post-translationally modified by phosphorylation. We performed a database search, which resulted in the identification of several other possible CKII phosphorylation sites, a number of protein kinase C phosphorylation sites and two tyrosine kinase phosphorylation sites. We then investigated whether the CSB protein is phosphorylated. Initially, recombinant CSB wt protein was incubated with purified CKII in the presence of &#x0005b;&#x003b3;-<sup>32</sup>P&#x0005d;ATP, and the products were analyzed by SDS&#x02013;PAGE. As seen in the top panel in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg164f8">8</xref>A, CKII is able to phosphorylate CSB <italic>in vitro</italic>. When cold GTP, which is a substrate for the CKII kinase and not for other kinases, was included in the reaction, the radioactive labeling of CSB was diminished (compare lanes 2&#x02013;4, top panel, in Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg164f8">8</xref>B). The bottom panel shows the Coomassie stain of the gel and verifies equal loading of the CSB protein. In addition, whole-cell extracts prepared from human primary fibroblasts, GM38B cells, could phosphorylate CSB, and this phosphorylation was out competed by addition of cold GTP as well (compare lanes 6&#x02013;8, top panel, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg164f8">8</xref>B), thus substantiating the potential role of CKII.</p></sec><sec><title>CSB is phosphorylated <italic>in vivo</italic></title><p>Recombinant proteins purified from insect cells are often phosphorylated. Western blotting and phospho-specific antibodies were used to test whether this is also the case for the CSB protein. The results shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg164f9">9</xref>A indicate that purified recombinant CSB wt was heavily phosphorylated at threonine residues but not at serine or tyrosine. Incubation with CKII increased the threonine phosphorylation slightly, but also induced phosphorylation at tyrosine and serine (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg164f9">9</xref>A, lanes 2 and 3). This is somewhat in conflict with the substrate specificity of CKII, which mainly phosphorylates threonine and serine residues, and could be explained by cross-reactivity of the antibody. Furthermore, it was tested if PP1 was able to remove the phosphorylation of the recombinant CSB. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg164f9">9</xref>A, lanes 4 and 5, PP1 reduced CSB phosphorylation significantly.</p><p>We next analyzed CSB phosphorylation in human cells <italic>in vivo</italic>. Normal human diploid fibroblasts (GM38B) were radioactively labeled with inorganic phosphate, proteins were isolated and CSB was precipitated by the use of a CSB-specific antibody. The lower panels of Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg164f9">9</xref>B show the silver staining of precipitated proteins analyzed by SDS&#x02013;PAGE, and indicate that similar amounts of CSB were precipitated in untreated cells and cells irradiated with 6 J&#x0002f;m<sup>2</sup>. CSB is clearly phosphorylated in unirradiated cells (top panels, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg164f9">9</xref>B) and, interestingly, UV radiation abolishes CSB phosphorylation after 4 h, while phosphorylation of CSB is partially recovered 24 h after UV (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg164f9">9</xref>, results were confirmed in three independent biological experiments).</p></sec><sec><title>CSB ATPase activity is regulated by phosphorylation</title><p>Having concluded that CSB is phosphorylated <italic>in vivo</italic>, we next investigated whether phosphorylation might affect the catalytic activity of CSB. ATPase activity was analyzed after dephosphorylating the recombinant CSB protein. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg164f10">10</xref>, dephosphorylation with 100 mU of PP1 significantly (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01) increased the ATPase activity of the purified protein by 38&#x00025;. PP1 had no ATPase activity and heat-inactivated (HI) PP1 did not result in a similar increase, confirming that increased CSB ATPase activity was a result of dephosphorylation. We were also curious to see if the ATPase activity of the mutant proteins was altered by dephosphorylation and found that it increased by &#x0223c;40&#x00025; as a result of dephosphorylation (data not shown). However, compared to CSB wt protein, the activity remained very low for the motif V and VI mutants and almost undetectable for the motif II mutant after dephosphorylation (data not shown).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In this study, purified CSB wt, motif II, motif V and motif VI recombinant mutant proteins were characterized. In motif II the conserved glutamate was substituted with glutamine (CSBE646Q), in motif V the two conserved threonines were substituted with valines (CSBT912&#x0002f;913V) and, finally, the conserved glutamine of motif VI was substituted with glutamate (CSBQ942E). Citterio <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg164c8">8</xref>) reported that dsDNA is the preferred DNA effector for the CSB wt protein and our results are consistent with this. We found a <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> of &#x0223c;31 min<sup>&#x02013;1</sup> with dsDNA and ssDNA effector only supported CSB ATP hydrolysis to a level of &#x0223c;5 min<sup>&#x02013;1</sup>.</p><p>The ATPase activity of the motif II E646Q mutant studied here was undetectable. This is comparable to a K538R motif I mutant reported to be completely devoid of ATPase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg164c8">8</xref>). These results are consistent with a role of the lysine of motif I and the glutamate of motif II in ATP binding and hydrolysis deduced from the structural analysis of the SF1 and SF2 proteins crystallized so far (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg164c10">10</xref>). Also, a mutation in the eIF4A RNA helicase, corresponding to the E646Q mutation in CSB, abolished the ATPase activity of eIF4A completely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg164c38">38</xref>). Despite the similar reduction in ATPase activity, RNA synthesis recovery of CS-B cells was partially complemented by the motif I mutant but not the motif II mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg164c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg164c13">13</xref>). The difference may reside in the types of assays used for quantifying RNA synthesis recovery &#x0005b;grain count of CSB microinjected cells versus <sup>3</sup>H-uridine incorporation in CSB-transfected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg164c8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg164c13">13</xref>)&#x0005d;. However, it may also suggest that while the ATPase activity of the two mutant proteins was reduced to a similar extent, the two motifs do not display totally overlapping functions <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>In contrast to motif I and II mutants, the CSBT912&#x0002f;913V and CSBQ942E mutants showed residual ATPase activity with &#x0223c;4-fold reduction of <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> in the presence of dsDNA as the cofactor, and the kinetic data indicate impairment of both ATP hydrolysis and binding (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg164f3">3</xref> and Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="gkg164tb2">2</xref>). In support of this, a filter-binding analysis of the non-hydrolyzable ATP analog ATP&#x003b3;<sup>35</sup>S also showed reduced ATP binding by the motif V and VI mutant proteins (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg164f5">5</xref>). Furthermore, DNA binding of the mutant proteins was at the wt level (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg164f6">6</xref>). These results are comparable to results obtained for mutational analysis of two different virus RNA helicases. A motif V mutant plum pox potyvirus RNA helicase (T305S resembling the CSBT912&#x0002f;913V mutant studied here) displayed significantly reduced ATPase activity and abrogated RNA helicase activity, while RNA binding remained intact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg164c39">39</xref>). Similarly, a motif VI (Q1486H) mutation of the NS3 helicase was shown to abrogate ATPase and helicase activity completely, while single-stranded RNA binding was increased (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg164c40">40</xref>). The CSBQ942E and CSBT912&#x0002f;913V mutants are very comparable to vector alone in genetic complementation of survival, RNA synthesis recovery and apoptosis after UV treatment and also sensitivity toward 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg164c14">14</xref>). Thus, the data presented here suggest that residual ATP hydrolysis does not result in even partial complementation, and that efficient ATP hydrolysis is an essential requirement for CSB to function <italic>in vivo</italic> in TCR and RNA synthesis recovery. The differential requirement of motif II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg164c15">15</xref>) and motifs V and VI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg164c21">21</xref>) in 8-oxoG repair can thus not be explained by their involvement in either ATP hydrolysis or DNA binding, but must reside in other functions such as the ability to change DNA topology or interactions with other proteins. In addition, we found similar nuclear localization of both CSB wt and mutant proteins. Therefore, we can conclude that the complementation defects of the mutant proteins are not caused by a deficiency in localization.</p><p>To investigate the regulation of CSB protein activity, we studied the effect of different cofactor DNA substrates on CSB wt ATPase activity. We find that substrates containing a loop or a small bubble stimulate CSB ATPase activity significantly, while no increase is observed with substrates where the double-strand to single-strand transition is sterically less strained. This suggests that the CSB ATPase activity is stimulated by a sharp bend in the DNA backbone. Although these data are in contrast to previous findings of stimulation by a splayed arm cofactor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg164c8">8</xref>), the results presented here were obtained under conditions of &#x0003c;20&#x00025; ATP hydrolysis, thereby allowing an actual kinetic analysis. RNAPII stalling leads to transcription bubble retraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg164c37">37</xref>), and it could be speculated that CSB encounters this DNA substrate when present in a stalled RNAPII complex and that the CSB ATPase activity is subsequently stimulated.</p><p>The presence of DNA damage <italic>per se</italic> did not stimulate the CSB ATPase activity above that of undamaged DNA, however, cisplatin-treated DNA consistently resulted in increased ATPase activity although not statistically significant. This may be explained by the damage spectra offered by these different agents. The main cisplatin lesion, d(GpG) 1,2-intrastrand cross-links, induces a very prominent bend of the DNA helix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg164c41">41</xref>). In contrast, the UV induced <italic>cis</italic>&#x02013;<italic>syn</italic> cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg164c6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg164c4">4</xref>) photoproducts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg164c42">42</xref>), 8-oxoG, 4,6-diamino-5-formamidopyrimidine and 2,6-diamino-4-hydroxy-5-formaidopyrimidine lesions induced by photoactivated MB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg164c43">43</xref>), and methylated bases induced by MMS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg164c33">33</xref>), result in less bending of the DNA helix. Thus, the increase in ATPase activity may be related to the degree of helix distortion introduced by the cisplatin lesions, and we are currently investigating this possibility in further detail.</p><p>The response to DNA damage involves the regulation of protein activity by phosphorylation of a large number of downstream targets. In addition, phosphorylation of the SNF2-like family proteins hBRM and BRG-1 leads to exclusion of the proteins from condensed chromatin during mitosis, whereas phosphorylated ATRX, which is also a SNF2-like family member, associates with condensed chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg164c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg164c27">27</xref>). Thus, we decided to analyze the potential phosphorylation of the CSB protein. Post-translational modification has not previously to our knowledge been investigated for the CSB protein and could play a major role in its function and regulation. Interestingly, CKII seems to play a role in the DNA damage checkpoint. CKII cDNA overexpression partially complements the UV sensitivity of xeroderma pigmentosum group D and C cells, and mutation of a subunit of the yeast homolog of CKII results in deficient adaptation to double-strand breaks and consequently irreversible arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg164c44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg164c45">45</xref>). We find that both purified CKII and human cell extracts can phosphorylate recombinant CSB protein <italic>in vitro</italic>, and that GTP inhibits this phosphorylation. Furthermore, purified recombinant CSB protein is heavily phosphorylated. Importantly, the CSB protein is found to be phosphorylated <italic>in vivo</italic> in human cells. Four hours after UV irradiation, CSB phosphorylation is absent, while CSB phosphorylation approaches initial levels 24 h after UV. This indicates that dephosphorylation of the protein occurs during the DNA repair process (NER).</p><p>Control of phosphorylation status seems to be essential to achieve competent repair. Inhibitors of protein phosphatases cause a dramatic reduction of repair activity in cell extracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg164c46">46</xref>), i.e. excessive phosphorylation can inhibit repair. In support of this, the cdk-activating kinase subcomplex of TFIIH inhibits repair in the presence of an ATP-generating system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg164c25">25</xref>). Furthermore, chromatin remodeling, which CSB is known to be involved in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg164c9">9</xref>), can also be regulated by phosphorylation. Sif <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg164c47">47</xref>) reported that a mitotically inactivated SWI&#x0002f;SNF complex containing phosphorylated BRG-1 is deficient in chromatin remodeling, and regains nucleosome remodeling activity upon dephosphorylation <italic>in vitro</italic>. Accordingly, we observed that CSB dephosphorylation <italic>in vitro</italic> resulted in an increase in ATPase activity. Our combined observations therefore suggest that CSB activity <italic>in vivo</italic> may also be controlled by phosphorylation, and that CSB activity is activated during the NER process via decreased phosphorylation. We are currently investigating how phosphorylation affects the chromatin remodeling function of CSB, and the interaction of CSB with different NER proteins. Extracts from UV-irradiated CS cells were shown to lack hypophosphorylated, initiation competent RNAPII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg164c48">48</xref>). This may indicate that both CSB and stalled RNAPII are dephosphorylated upon UV irradiation in wt cells, and that CSB is important for the release of hypophosphorylated RNAPII for transcription initiation.</p><p>In summary, the analyzed residues of motifs II, V and VI are essential for CSB ATPase activity as well as biological activity and residual ATPase activity is insufficient to complement the UV-sensitive phenotypes of CS cells. Results presented here indicate that CSB senses DNA secondary structure and thereby is activated. As a model of CSB function in elongation, it can be speculated that when RNAPII is stalled reversibly at intrinsic signals, due to RNA secondary structure or low nucleotide pools, CSB may help push the polymerase past the impediment as a result of DNA structure-dependent activation of CSB. CSB may stimulate elongation both by changing the conformation of nascent DNA and by acting on chromatin structure in the proximity of the polymerase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg164c9">9</xref>). However, when the polymerase cannot be stimulated to elongate, due to the nature of the blockage, TFIIH is recruited, the presence of damage is verified and NER (or possibly BER) proceeds. We find that CSB is dephosphorylated in response to UV and that dephosphorylation increases CSB ATPase activity. This suggests that phosphorylation status is involved in controlling the level of CSB activity <italic>in vivo</italic>. Whether CSB phosphorylation is controlled in a cell-cycle-dependent manner, after oxidative damage, and perhaps by RNAPII stalling are important questions that await further studies.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkg164f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Diagram showing the CSB protein.
