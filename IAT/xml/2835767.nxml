In yeast cells, <italic>de novo</italic> formation of Sup35 aggregates is greatly facilitated by high protein concentrations and the presence of preformed Q/N-rich protein aggregates that template Sup35 polymerization. Here, we have investigated whether aggregation-promoting polyglutamine (polyQ) tracts can stimulate the <italic>de novo</italic> formation of ordered Sup35 protein aggregates in the absence of Q/N-rich yeast prions. Fusion proteins with polyQ tracts of different lengths were produced and their ability to spontaneously self-assemble into amlyloid structures was analyzed using <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> model systems. We found that Sup35 fusions with pathogenic (&#x02265;54 glutamines), as opposed to non-pathogenic (19 glutamines) polyQ tracts efficiently form seeding-competent protein aggregates. Strikingly, polyQ-mediated <italic>de novo</italic> assembly of Sup35 protein aggregates in yeast cells was independent of pre-existing Q/N-rich protein aggregates. This indicates that increasing the content of aggregation-promoting sequences enhances the tendency of Sup35 to spontaneously self-assemble into insoluble protein aggregates. A similar result was obtained when pathogenic polyQ tracts were linked to the yeast prion protein Rnq1, demonstrating that polyQ sequences are generic inducers of amyloidogenesis. In conclusion, long polyQ sequences are powerful molecular tools that allow the efficient production of seeding-competent amyloid structures.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Amyloids are fibrillar, highly ordered protein aggregates with a typical cross &#x003b2;-sheet structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009642-Dobson1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

Over time, they transform into larger aggregate species with a more fibrillar morphology, often termed &#x0201c;protofibrils&#x0201d; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009642-Walsh1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>.

Finally, protofibrils self-assemble efficiently into large mature amyloid fibrils, perhaps through association of monomers or oligomers, which is often accompanied by a structural reorganisation of aggregates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009642-Dobson1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Currently, the molecular mechanisms behind the initiation of amyloid self-assembly are largely unclear.

On the other hand, experimental evidence showed the earliest detectable oligomer species to be fairly distinctive structures, suggesting that they are formed by specific protein-protein interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009642-Green1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. In any case, the process is slow and inefficient, with a significant entropic barrier that is mainly controlled by the concentration of monomers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009642-Nelson1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>A wide range of factors has been reported to influence spontaneous amyloid assembly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009642-Pawar1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>.

We found that PrD and Sup35 fusions with long, pathogenic polyQ tracts (&#x02265;54 glutamines) efficiently self-assemble into seeding-competent, SDS-stable protein aggregates, while fusions with short, non-pathogenic polyQ tracts (19 glutamines) or proteins without a polyQ tag do not. Moreover, we observed that <italic>de novo</italic> amyloidogenesis of PrD- or Sup35-polyQ fusions is largely independent of extrinsic factors such as other Q/N-rich yeast prions, indicating that increasing the content of aggregation-promoting sequences in proteins enhances their tendency to spontaneously self-assemble into insoluble protein aggregates.</p><p>Why do long but not short polyQ tracts stimulate spontaneous amyloidogenesis? Recent NMR studies revealed that long polyQ tracts are structurally very similar to short polyQ tracts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009642-Klein1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. This implies that both species should have similar biochemical and biophysical properties and both should be able to stimulate spontaneous amyloid assembly. We suggest that long polyQ sequences are more potent initiators of <italic>de novo</italic> aggregation because they can form hyperstable &#x003b2;-sheets in soluble proteins independently of their folding state. These &#x003b2;-sheets, stabilised by hydrogen bonds, are exposed on the protein surface. In this way, they might be able to associate with &#x003b2;-sheets of long polyQ tracts in other proteins and thereby could form stable aggregation-competent protein complexes. In strong contrast, short polyQ sequences do not form stable &#x003b2;-sheets in soluble proteins. Therefore, the spontaneous assembly of amyloidogenic protein aggregates is unlikely, and extrinsic factors such as molecular chaperones or preformed &#x003b2;-sheet-rich aggregates are required to mediate amyloid formation. Recent structural studies support the hypothesis that short polyQ sequences in huntingtin do not form stable &#x003b2;-sheets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009642-Kim1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>. Instead, they are highly flexible and can adopt multiple conformations, including &#x003b2;-helical, random coil and extended loop structures.</p><p>Structural studies of polyQ-containing fibrillar aggregates suggest that they consist of cylindrical &#x003b2;-sheets held together by hydrogen bonds between the main chain and the side chain amides <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009642-Perutz1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>. In this model, one turn of &#x003b2;-sheets consists of 20 glutamine residues. It is most likely unstable because it cannot be held together by hydrogen bonds. In strong contrast, a &#x003b2;-sheet structure of two helical turns (&#x0223c;40 glutamines) is much more stable because it is joined together by hydrogen bonds between amides of successive turns. This is coherent with our results that proteins with long polyQ tracts (&#x02265;54 glutamines) form stable amyloid structures much faster than proteins with short a polyQ sequence (19 glutamines). At the same time, a pathogenic threshold of &#x0223c;40 glutamines was observed in a large number of polyQ diseases like Huntington's disease or spinocerebellar ataxias <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009642-Gusella1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>There have been several studies on long polyQ tracts and their ability to form stable &#x003b2;-sheets in soluble protein molecules.

Interestingly, these authors also showed that &#x003b2;-sheet formation precedes spontaneous aggregation, indicating that it is critical for initiation of protein polymerization.

In our studies, we could successfully confirm these results. However, we also observed that long polyQ tracts fused to the C-terminus are more potent initiators of Sup35 polymerization than performed heterogenous protein aggregates. This indicates that amyloid templates with Q/N-rich domains in trans promote polymerization of soluble Sup35 molecules less efficiently than aggregation-prone polyQ sequences in cis.</p><p>We assume that polyQ-mediated polar zipper formation in Sup35 fusion proteins leads to enhanced misfolding, protein aggregation and an improved exposure of normally masked Q/N-rich domains.

Rather, we intended to examine the spontaneous aggregation of artificial Sup35 fusion proteins containing two potential aggregation-promoting domains such as a Q/N-rich PrD and a polyQ tract.</p><p>A large number of neurodegenerative disorders including Huntington's disease are caused by the expansion of polyQ tracts that drive aggregation of the affected proteins. Our data demonstrate that pathogenic polyQ tracts are potent initiators of amyloidogenesis, dramatically accelerating spontaneous protein self-assembly. Pathogenic polyQ sequences are able to escape the cellular control mechanisms and to act as seeding templates for homologous as well as heterologous proteins. This means that the disease proteins in polyQ disorders might also convert unrelated proteins into amyloid structures. Therapeutic strategies for polyQ diseases therefore need to focus on small molecules that target pathogenic but not non-pathogenic polyQ sequences. Moreover, they should not influence the normal function of glutamine-rich proteins, which are commonly found in mammalian cells. Our polyQ-mediated aggregation system in yeast could be very useful for the identification of modulators that specifically influence the self-assembly of disease-associated polyQ tracts and trigger neurodegeneration in various diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Yeast Strains</title><p>GT17 (<italic>MAT</italic><bold>a</bold><italic>ade1-14 his3-&#x00394;200 leu2-3,112 trp-289 ura3-52</italic> &#x0005b;<italic>psi</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup>&#x0005d;&#x0005b;<italic>pin</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup>&#x0005d;), OT56 (<italic>MAT</italic><bold>a</bold><italic>ade1-14 his3-&#x00394;200 leu2-3,112 trp-289 ura3-52</italic> &#x0005b;<italic>PSI</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup>&#x0005d;&#x0005b;<italic>PIN</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup>&#x0005d;) and OT78 (<italic>MAT</italic><bold>a</bold><italic>ade1-14 his3-&#x00394;200 leu2-3,112 trp-289 ura3-52 hsp104&#x00394;::LEU2</italic> &#x0005b;<italic>psi</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup>&#x0005d;&#x0005b;<italic>pin</italic><sup>&#x02212;</sup>&#x0005d;) are derivatives of the yeast strain 74D-694 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009642-Derkatch2">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009642-Derkatch3">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009642-Chernoff1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Plasmids</title><p>For protein expression in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, the plasmids pYex2T <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0009642-Holz1">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref>, pYex2T/L and pGADcup1 were used. pYex2T is a pYEXbx-based 2&#x000b5; <italic>URA3 leu2-d</italic> vector (Clontech) containing a copper inducible promoter. pYex2T/L was constructed from pYex2T by deleting the 1.2 kb <italic>BstE</italic>II-<italic>Kpn</italic>I fragment carrying the <italic>leu2-d</italic> sequence.
