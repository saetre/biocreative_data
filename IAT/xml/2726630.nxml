The S1 site lies within a key negative regulatory region (NRR) of the receptor, which contains three highly conserved Lin12/Notch repeats and a heterodimerization domain (HD) that interact to prevent premature signaling in the absence of ligands. Because the role of S1 cleavage in Notch signaling remains unresolved, we investigated the effect of S1 cleavage on the structure, surface trafficking and ligand-mediated activation of human Notch1 and Notch2, as well as on ligand-independent activation of Notch1 by mutations found in human leukemia.</p></sec><sec><title>Principal Findings</title><p>The X-ray structure of the Notch1 NRR after furin cleavage shows little change when compared with that of an engineered Notch1 NRR lacking the S1-cleavage loop. Likewise, NMR studies of the Notch2 HD domain show that the loop containing the S1 site can be removed or cleaved without causing a substantial change in its structure. However, Notch1 and Notch2 receptors engineered to resist S1 cleavage exhibit unexpected differences in surface delivery and signaling competence: S1-resistant Notch1 receptors exhibit decreased, but detectable, surface expression and ligand-mediated receptor activation, whereas S1-resistant Notch2 receptors are fully competent for cell surface delivery and for activation by ligands. Variable dependence on S1 cleavage also extends to T-ALL-associated NRR mutations, as common class 1 mutations display variable decrements in ligand-independent activation when introduced into furin-resistant receptors, whereas a class 2 mutation exhibits increased signaling activity.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>S1 cleavage has distinct effects on the surface expression of Notch1 and Notch2, but is not generally required for physiologic or pathophysiologic activation of Notch proteins. These findings are consistent with models for receptor activation in which ligand-binding or T-ALL-associated mutations lead to conformational changes of the NRR that permit metalloprotease cleavage.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Notch proteins are modular, single-pass transmembrane receptors that transduce signals between neighboring cells in multicellular organisms.

In humans, roughly 40&#x00025; of cases of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) harbor acquired mutations involving the NRR of Notch1 that take the form of point mutations and small in-frame insertions and deletions (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006613-Aster1">&#x0005b;20&#x0005d;</xref> for a recent review). These mutations can be classified based on whether they lie within the NRR core (class 1) or consist instead of insertions of 12 or more amino acids in the juxtamembrane regions immediately adjacent to the S2 site (class 2). The rare class 2 mutations are believed to create a deprotected S2 cleavage site, a model consistent with the observation that these mutations typically produce large, ligand-independent increases in Notch1 signaling activity. In contrast, the more common class 1 mutations are of lower, more variable strength and appear to destabilize the NRR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006613-Malecki1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. Whether or not the activating effects of these mutations depend on S1 cleavage has not yet been examined.</p><p>The functional significance of cleavage by furin-like proteases varies among different transmembrane proteins; in some instances, cleavage is required for activity, whereas in others it has little or no effect. For example, class I viral envelope glycoproteins, which constitute the membrane fusion machinery of viruses like influenza and HIV, undergo an essential priming cleavage by a furin-like protease during maturation to generate the fusion-active protein. This cleavage step induces the transmembrane subunit to undergo a dramatic conformational change that allows its N-terminal end (also called the &#x0201c;fusion peptide&#x0201d;) to engage the target cell membrane in response to co-receptor (HIV) or low pH (influenza hemagglutinin) and initiate entry of the virus into the cell (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006613-Harrison1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref> for a recent review). In contrast, while low-density lipoprotein related protein (LRP-1) undergoes cleavage by furin during maturation and export to the cell surface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006613-Willnow1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, mutated forms that remain unprocessed bind, endocytose, and degrade ligands with kinetics indistinguishable from normal receptors, with the only reported effect of furin resistance apparently being slowed transport of LRP-1 to the cell surface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006613-Ko1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Studies to date on the effect of S1 cleavage on Notch function have yielded disparate results and conclusions. Early studies of mammalian Notch receptors suggested that S1 cleavage is a prerequisite for delivery of receptors to the cell surface. Murine Notch1 receptors rendered resistant to furin cleavage by mutation of the primary S1-cleavage site on the carboxyl side of R1654 accumulate intracellularly in HeLa cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006613-Logeat1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, and biotinylation studies failed to detect uncleaved precursor forms of Notch1 and Notch2 at the cell membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006613-Blaumueller1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Conversely, Weinmaster's group has shown that mutated Notch1 receptors resistant to cleavage at S1 are competent for cell surface expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006613-Bush1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006613-Nichols1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, but are apparently defective in terms of ligand-mediated activation of canonical Notch signaling, leading to the suggestion that dissociation of NTM may be a prerequisite for ligand-induced S2 cleavage. On the other hand, studies using furin-resistant receptors in the fly have suggested that S1 cleavage is not required for the function of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Notch <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006613-Kidd1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, no consensus has been reached about the role of S1 cleavage in Notch function. X-ray structures of the NRR regions from human Notch1 and Notch2, solved using polypeptides engineered to remove the S1 cleavage site, suggest that the S1 site of both receptors lies within a loop outside of the structural core of the HD domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006613-Gordon1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006613-Gordon2">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover, both the length of the S1-cleavage loop and its amino acid sequence are poorly conserved in mammalian Notch receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006613-g001">Figure 1B</xref>), suggesting that the functional role of S1 cleavage in Notch signaling may not be straightforward, and might even vary according to the specific receptor being studied.</p><p>Here, we have determined the effects of S1 cleavage on the structure of the juxtamembrane portions of human Notch1 and Notch2, and have examined the effects of S1-resistance on the surface expression and ligand-mediated activation of these two receptors in quantitative assays. We find that S1 cleavage does not result in a substantial or large-scale change in the conformation of the Notch1 NRR, nor does it dramatically alter the conformation of the isolated Notch2 HD domain. For functional studies, S1 resistant receptors were engineered by deletion of the S1 cleavage loop using the structural studies as a guide (referred to as &#x0201c;loopout&#x0201d; or LO receptors; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006613-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). While S1-resistant Notch1 receptors show increased intracellular retention, S1 cleavage is not absolutely required for surface expression or ligand-induced receptor activation. We also find that furin-resistance has little effect on ligand-independent Notch1 activation by a prototypic class 2 T-ALL-associated mutation, and only partially suppresses Notch1 activation by class 1 T-ALL-associated mutations. In contrast to Notch1 receptors, S1-resistant Notch2 receptors are fully competent for cell surface delivery and for activation by ligands. Together, these findings argue against a requisite role for S1 cleavage in physiologic or pathophysiologic Notch receptor activation, and highlight how subtle differences among Notch receptors in response to S1 cleavage may result in receptor-specific functional consequences.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Structure of furin-cleaved human Notch1 NRR</title><p>To investigate the structural consequences of proteolysis of human Notch1 with furin, we determined the structure of the human Notch1 NRR by X-ray crystallography after <italic>in vitro</italic> furin cleavage.

In order to do this as quantitatively as possible, we used isogenic cell lines that permit the tetracycline-inducible expression of proteins of interest from a single genomic FRT recombination site. We introduced into this site expression cassettes that encode chimeric Notch1 receptors consisting of (from N-terminus to C-terminus): the Notch1 leader peptide; a FLAG epitope tag; the ectodomains and transmembrane domain of Notch1 or Notch2, with or without the loop-deletion mutations identical to those used in structural studies that confer S1-resistance; and a common intracellular domain consisting of the DNA-binding domain of Gal4, the strong transcriptional activation domain of Notch1, and the C-terminal PEST domain of Notch1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006613-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). These proteins are referred to as N1-GAL4, N1-GAL4-LO, N2/N1-GAL4, and N2/N1-GAL4-LO, respectively. The rationale for using these chimeric receptors was twofold. First, the Gal4 reporter genes have negligible intrinsic activity in mammalian cells, thus providing excellent signal to noise ratios in ligand-dependent activation assays while avoiding the confounding influence of signals generated by endogenous Notch receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006613-Li1">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>. Second, the use of chimeras with identical intracellular regions ensures that differences in surface delivery or signaling activity can be directly attributed to differences in the Notch1 and Notch2 ectodomains.

The structural studies clarify how S1 cleavage affects the conformation of the Notch1 NRR, and the studies of trafficking and signaling by Notch1 and Notch2 receptors engineered to be S1 resistant highlight the difficulties in generalizing conclusions based on studies of single Notch receptor family members.</p><p>Previously reported X-ray structures of the Notch1 and Notch2 negative regulatory regions were determined using recombinant proteins with deletions that removed the S1-cleavage loop. In both structures, the S1 cleavage site was predicted to lie in a loop connecting beta-strands 3 and 4, more than 17 &#x000c5; away from the S2 site and well removed from all other interdomain contacts.</p><p>The X-ray structure of the furin-cleaved Notch1 NRR clearly shows that S1 cleavage only causes minor local perturbations in the conformation of the NRR, which remains in its autoinhibited form after processing at S1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006613-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Biophysical characterization of the isolated Notch2 HD domain by NMR also confirms that the structure of the HD domain is minimally perturbed by furin cleavage or by excision of the S1 loop. The NMR studies suggest that the S1 cleavage site in Notch2 also lies within an unstructured region of the HD domain and show that furin cleavage does not contribute to the proper folding of the isolated HD domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006613-g003">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006613-g004">4</xref>). Although these results may have been predicted based on inspection of the loop-deleted receptors, these studies provide the first direct evidence that S1 cleavage exerts little effect on the conformation of either Notch1 or Notch2.</p><p>A more surprising finding is that there is a differential effect on signaling and trafficking when S1 resistance is engineered into the Notch1 and Notch2 receptors. Notch2 receptors lacking the S1 loop appear to traffic normally to the cell surface and are activated by ligand to a comparable or greater degree than normal receptors. On the other hand, Notch1 receptors lacking the S1 loop exhibit a substantial defect in transport to the cell surface, with steady state cell-surface levels reduced by 5&#x02013;10-fold, even though there are comparable levels of overall expression. Despite the reduced number of S1-resistant Notch1 receptors at the surface, uncleaved Notch1 receptors retain their ability to signal, either in response to ligand or when combined in <italic>cis</italic> with a T-ALL associated mutation. The persistent strong activity of the class 2 mutation tested here in the context of the loop deletion suggests the possibility that activating proteolysis of these cancer-associated mutations occurs prior to surface delivery, somewhere in the late ER or Golgi. The hypomorphic activity of an S1-resistant receptor that closely resembles the Notch1 variant investigated here is also consistent with the reduced surface expression and signaling activity we observe with our S1-resistant protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006613-Nichols1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. Overall, despite the qualitative differences between Notch1 and Notch2, our data, in combination with published studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006613-Nichols1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006613-Kidd1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref> support the conclusion that S1 cleavage is not absolutely required for conveying Notch signals. Though unlikely, it is even possible that differential susceptibility of uncleaved N1 and N2 receptors to intracellular retention allows the expression level of furin-like proteases to influence N1 vs. N2 signaling in cells where both proteins are being expressed.</p><p>Studies by Artavanis-Tsakonas and colleagues in an accompanying manuscript also point to complexity in analyzing the role of S1 cleavage in <italic>Drosophila</italic> Notch. The <italic>Drosophila</italic> protein has two potential sites for S1 cleavage, based on analysis of the primary amino-acid sequence. Structure-based sequence alignment places the first potential site, RLKK (<italic>Drosophila</italic> residue numbering 1637&#x02013;1640; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006613-g001">Figure 1B</xref>), at a location analogous to the end of beta-strand two and in the connecting segment to strand three (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0006613-g002">Figure 2</xref>), and the second potential site, RKNK (<italic>Drosophila</italic> residue numbering 1667&#x02013;1670) in the unstructured loop that aligns to the region that contains the mammalian S1 cleavage site. Neither mutation of the RKNK sequence or loop deletion, however, prevents cleavage of the fly protein into extracellular and transmembrane subunits. Though mutation of the RLKK site in the fly protein creates a receptor that is not processed, active, or observed at the cell surface, it is not certain whether this outcome is a secondary consequence of global structural disruption, or a result of a critical dependence on S1 cleavage for Notch function in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p><p>The lack of an absolute requirement for S1 cleavage in promoting the maturation of mammalian Notch receptors is consistent with a number of prior studies, and is easily reconciled with others in light of recent structural and biochemical advances. In chimeric mouse/fly receptors expressed in 293T cells, replacement of the mouse Notch1 S1-cleavage loop by the <italic>Drosophila</italic> loop region results in expression of the full-length protein, rather than the S1 cleaved form, on the cell surface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006613-Kidd1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>.

In two of these studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006613-Bush1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006613-Kidd1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, S1 cleavage was abolished by deleting not only the cleavage sites, but also by eliminating the most highly conserved sequence in the HD domain, the LEIDNR sequence, which in human Notch2 lies on a beta-strand from residues 1624&#x02013;1630 right in the core of the HD domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0006613-Gordon2">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, it is virtually certain that these mutations had additional unintended effects beyond simple inhibition of cleavage at site S1.</p><p>What then is the role of cleavage of mammalian Notch receptors by furin-like proteases? It seems likely that S1 cleavage of receptors undergoing transport through the Golgi has some specific functional importance, because the cleavage site is present in mammalian Notches 1&#x02013;3. One additional possibility is that S1 cleavage facilitates proper down-regulation of Notch receptors. The extracellular part of Notch1 and Notch2 (like other Notch receptors) is very large and includes thirty-nine disulfide-bonded domains (36 EGF-like repeats and 3 LNRs) that are expected to require reduction before becoming sensitive to proteolytic degradation during turnover. Retro-translocation and endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation, or lysosomal degradation, would pose a formidable challenge if there were no S1 cleavage event to decouple the extracellular and transmembrane subunits. Perhaps S1 cleavage thus allows for efficient disposal of the NTM subunit by dissociating it from the rest of the extracellular part of the receptor. In this case, a cleavage site (S1) that is distinct from activating cleavage sites (S2 and S3) would allow cellular degradation machinery to distinguish receptors designated for destruction from those designated for proteolytic activation. Further studies are needed to test this possibility and to understand the biological role of S1 cleavage in Notch receptor function.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Recombinant protein expression and purification</title><p>A plasmid encoding the human Notch1 NRR (residues E1446-Q1733; Genbank ID 148833507) was modified to contain a N-terminal hexahistidine tag followed by a TEV cleavage site.
