In most strains tumors grow rapidly but fail to metastasize. An exception has been found in the Czech-II/Ei mouse in which bone tumors metastasize regularly to the lung. These tumors resemble human osteosarcoma in their propensity for pulmonary metastasis. Cell lines established from these metastatic tumors have been compared with ones from non-metastatic osteosarcomas arising in C3H/BiDa mice. Osteopontin, a chemokine implicated in migration and metastasis, is known to be transcriptionally induced by the viral middle T antigen. Czech-II/Ei and C3H/BiDa tumor cells expressed middle T and secreted osteopontin at comparable levels as the major chemoattractant. The tumor cell lines migrated equally well in response to recombinant osteopontin as the sole attractant. An important difference emerged in assays for invasion in which tumor cells from Czech-II/Ei mice were able to invade across an extracellular matrix barrier while those from C3H/BiDa mice were unable to invade. Invasive behavior was linked to elevated levels of the metalloproteinase MMP-2 and of the transcription factor NFAT. Inhibition of either MMP-2 or NFAT inhibited invasion by Czech-II/Ei osteosarcoma cells. The metastatic phenotype is dominant in F1 mice. Osteosarcoma cell lines from F1 mice expressed intermediate levels of MMP-2 and NFAT and were invasive. Osteosarcomas in Czech-II/Ei mice retain functional p53. This virus-host model of metastasis differs from engineered models targeting p53 or pRb and provides a system for investigating the genetic and molecular basis of bone tumor metastasis in the absence of p53 loss.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>The oncogenic mouse polyoma virus and its mutants have previously been used to investigate viral determinants of tumor induction using a standard inbred mouse strain as a common host. Here we use wild type virus to investigate the role of the host genetic background, focusing on two host strains that differ with respect to bone tumor metastasis. Comparing osteosarcoma cell lines from these mice, we have identified a molecular pathway that underlies invasive behavior <italic>in vitro</italic> and correlates with metastasis <italic>in vivo</italic>. The pathway involves secretion of the metalloproteinase MMP-2 under partial control of NFAT as a transcriptional regulator. This virus-host system reflects an important feature of human osteosarcoma with respect to pulmonary metastasis. Based on naturally occurring differences among inbred mice, the model differs from genetically engineered models targeting p53 or pRb as known risk factors in the human disease. Here, metastatic osteosarcomas retain functional p53. As noted by others, the frequency of p53 loss in patients with localized versus metastatic disease is the same, suggesting that events beyond p53 loss are important in metastasis. While the downstream effectors of metastasis in the genetically engineered models remain unknown, evidence presented here implicates upregulation of an NFAT &#x02192; MMP-2 pathway in the development of metastatic osteosarcoma.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="8"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Invasion and metastasis are major factors underlying cancer morbidity and mortality <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000733-Molloy1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

In CZ mice, however, these tumors have been found to metastasize regularly to the lung. Osteosarcomas develop most frequently on the femur, skull, ribs or other long bones, and occasionally on the spine and sternum. A typical case in a CZ mouse is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000733-g001">Figure 1</xref>. The primary tumor arose on the head of the femur (panel A). This tumor showed evidence of invasion of adjacent muscle and destruction of bone (panel B). A metastatic lesion was evident as a smooth shiny nodule on the surface of the lung (panel C). This nodule showed abundant tumor cells mixed with deposits of osteoid (panel D). Lung metastases were seen in a high percentage of CZ mice by routine step-sectioning and histological examination. These lesions consistently showed production of osteoid (panel E). Metastases were noted rarely in the liver. To confirm that the liver lesions in Py-infected CZ mice also derived from osteosarcomas, cells from a primary bone tumor were inoculated subcutaneously into an uninfected CZ mouse. This animal showed growth of tumor cells in the liver with deposits of osteoid (panel F). The presence of osteoid in metastastic lesions in CZ mice confirms their origins from osteosarcomas and not from other tumor types arising in the same animals. Further support derives from the fact that no lung metastases were noted in CZ mice that failed to develop primary osteosarcoma while developing other kinds of tumors.</p><fig id="ppat-1000733-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1000733.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Primary and metastatic bone tumors from CZ mice.</title><p>A) A primary bone tumor (P) on the head of the femur of a CZ mouse.

However, these tumors showed no evidence of lung metastasis using the same search criteria as for CZ mice. A direct comparison of the frequencies of primary and metastatic osteosarcoma in CZ and C3 mice highlights important differences between these strains (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1000733-t001">Table 1</xref>). A high proportion of CZ mice developed osteosarcomas and 90&#x00025; of these were found to have metastasized to the lung. The actual frequency of lung metastasis in CZ mice may approach 100&#x00025; given the likelihood that not all lesions will be found in the step sectioning process. Osteosarcomas in C3 mice were found at a lower frequency due in part to higher frequencies of other tumor types that develop early and require the animals to be sacrificed. Nevertheless, of 18 cases of osteosarcoma in C3 mice, none were found to have metastasized to the lung. The sharp difference in frequency of metastasis between hosts is not due to differences in the time allowed for tumor development. The average &#x02018;time to necropsy&#x02019; was 190 days for CZ and 188 for C3, with ranges of 104&#x02013;514 days for CZ and 70 &#x02013; 655 for C3.</p><table-wrap id="ppat-1000733-t001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1000733.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><title>Host control of metastasis in CZ, C3 and &#x0005b;CZ x C3&#x0005d; F1 mice.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="ppat-1000733-t001-1" xlink:href="ppat.1000733.t001"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mouse strain</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">No. of animals</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Osteosarcoma</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Lung Mx (&#x00025;)</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">CZ</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">38</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">33</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">30 (91)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">C3</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">106</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">18</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x0005b;CZ X C3&#x0005d; F1</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">16</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">12</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">11 (92)</td></tr></tbody></table></alternatives></table-wrap><p>&#x0005b;CZ x C3&#x0005d; F1 mice were infected and followed for the development of osteosarcoma and then screened for lung metastases.

OPN is of particular interest because expression of middle T has been shown to lead to transcriptional activation of OPN via two distinct pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000733-Whalen1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>.

Pretreatment of conditioned medium with anti-OPN resulted in significant reduction in the migration of CZ-I cells while anti-VEGF had no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000733-g002">Figure 2B, left panel</xref>). Results were the same using the other lines as responding cells (data not shown). To determine whether the pathways from middle T to OPN operated equally in the two host backgrounds, levels of OPN were compared in conditioned media prepared from CZ and C3 bone tumor lines. Levels were found to be high and comparable between the two groups: 1975&#x000b1;262 pg/ml for the two CZ lines and 1592&#x000b1;38 pg/ml for the three C3 lines. Similarly, levels of VEGF, though much lower, were comparable: 153&#x000b1;12 pg/ml for CZ and 225&#x000b1;13 pg/ml for C3.</p><p>Additional experiments were carried out to test the specificity of migration in relation to these factors and also with respect to tumor type. Conditioned medium from a Py-induced hemangioma in a C3 mouse contained a higher level of VEGF (792&#x000b1;38 pg/ml) and a similar level of OPN (1622&#x000b1;20 pg/ml) compared to osteosarcoma conditioned media. Migration of CZ cells was again inhibited only by anti-OPN and not by anti-VEGF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000733-g002">Figure 2B</xref>, middle panel). In contrast, migration of the hemangioma cells in response to its own conditioned medium was inhibited by anti-VEGF as well as anti-OPN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000733-g002">Figure 2B, right panel</xref>). These results confirm OPN as the major attractant for osteosarcoma cells. They also demonstrate specificity in migratory behavior based on tumor type as well as attractant.</p><p>The osteosarcoma lines were compared for their abilities to migrate in response to recombinant OPN added to serum-free medium as the sole attractant. All nine lines responded well with no significant differences among the lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000733-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). We conclude that the difference in metastatic behavior between CZ and C3 osteosarcomas is not due to a difference either in production of OPN or in ability to migrate in response to this factor. This conclusion is consistent with studies of mammary tumor metastasis in Py middle T transgenic mice which indicated that factor(s) in addition to OPN are required for metastasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000733-Jessen1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>CZ but not C3 bone tumor cells show properties of invasion</title><p>An important difference between CZ and C3 osteosarcoma cell lines was seen using a &#x02018;Matrigel&#x02019; invasion assay in Boyden chambers with coated membranes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000733-Albini1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>.

MMP-2 was detected in each of the cell lines but levels were higher in CZ and F1 compared to C3 tumor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000733-g003">Figure 3B</xref>, bottom). Levels of endogenous MMP-2 were estimated by densitometry. Values were normalized to loading controls and averaged for the cell lines based on host of origin. The values (arbitrary units) were 1.14&#x000b1;0.22 for the three C3 lines, 3.79&#x000b1;0.27 for the F1 lines and 5.18&#x000b1;1.37 for the CZ lines. The tumor cells from CZ thus expresses 4 to 5 fold higher levels of the protease than those from C3. Comparison of the zymograph with the immunoblot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000733-g003">Figure 3B</xref>) suggests that secreted levels of MMP-2 may be even more disproportionate (CZ &#x0003e; C3). This would indicate that differences in the secretory pathway or extracellular activation of the enzyme may also contribute to the ability to invade. Other MMPs not directly tested for here may also be involved.</p><p>The finding of higher levels of MMP-2 secreted by CZ and F1 compared to C3 tumor cells raises the possibility of involvement of the transcription factor NFAT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000733-Rao1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>.

The levels of all three were elevated in tumor cells from CZ and F1 compared to C3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000733-g004">Figure 4A</xref>).

Addition of TIMP-2 resulted in a 3 to 4 fold inhibition of invasion. Two siRNAs were used to directly inhibit expression of NFAT. Both were effective in reducing NFAT levels with concomitant effects on MMP-2. Importantly, both were effective in inhibiting invasion. siRNA2 was particularly effective, reducing MMP-2 levels 4 to 5 fold and blocking invasion 6 to 7 fold. Similar results were obtained with all three CZ and all three F1 lines. Thus, treatments targeting either the protease or its upstream regulator result in inhibition of invasion. These results suggest that operation of an NFAT &#x02192; MMP-2 pathway at elevated levels contributes to the metastatic behavior of osteosarcomas in CZ and F1 mice.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>The CZ mouse model of osteosarcoma differs from genetically engineered models</title><p>Several mouse models of osteosarcoma have been developed based on loss or alteration of p53 or pRb. These reflect the occurrence of osteosarcoma in families with germline mutations in these tumor suppressor genes and with their frequent somatic alterations in sporadic cases of the disease. Mice with germline loss of p53 or ones expressing certain gain-of-function mutants develop osteosarcoma along with a variety of other tumors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000733-Jacks1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000733-Olive1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>.

The events that give rise to metastasis following disruption of the transcriptional regulatory functions of these tumor suppressors are not known.</p><p>The predisposition to bone tumor metastasis in Py-infected CZ mice is dominantly inherited and presumed to be independent of p53 or pRb loss. Neither CZ nor C3 mice develop spontaneous tumors at a rate that would suggest the absence or altered function of p53 or pRb. Polyoma is unusual among the oncogenic DNA tumor viruses in its failure to inhibit or degrade p53 in tumors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000733-Dey1">&#x0005b;39&#x0005d;</xref>. The possibility of spontaneous loss of p53 in CZ osteosarcomas was nevertheless investigated. Tumor cell lines from CZ, C3 and F1 mice were examined for p53 expression and for their response to DNA damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000733-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Cells were exposed to actinomycin D (10&#x02013;50 nM) for 24 hours. This led to phosphorylation on serine-18 (serine-15 in humans) and accumulation of p53 and to induction of p21<sup>Cip1/Waf1</sup>, as previously shown for cells in culture productively infected by the virus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000733-Dahl1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>. Similar results were found for the other lines (data not shown). pRb function is disrupted by binding to Py large T antigen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000733-Larose1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. However, the ability of the virus to induce tumors does not depend on this interaction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000733-Freund1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, and metastatic mammary tumors develop without large T in middle T transgenic mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000733-Guy1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>. The large T-pRb interaction is expected to occur equally in tumors of CZ, C3 and F1 mice. While disruption of pRb by large T may be necessary for metastatic behavior, it is not sufficient. It thus appears that the difference between CZ and C3 mice with respect to bone tumor metastasis is based on host genetic factor(s) unrelated to p53 loss or to the action of the virus on pRb.</p><fig id="ppat-1000733-g005" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1000733.g005</object-id><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Induction of p53 and p21<sup>Cip1/Waf1</sup> in a DNA damage response in metastatic and non-metastatic bone tumor cell lines.</title><p>Cell extracts were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted as indicated.
