Despite intensive studies on their physiological and pathological functions, the molecular mechanism of how miRNA gene transcription is regulated remains largely unknown. Microarray profiling revealed 21 miRNAs clustered on chromosome 12, including miR-433 and miR-127, that were co-upregulated in small heterodimer partner (SHP, NR0B2) SHP knockouts (<italic>SHP<sup>&#x02013;/&#x02013;</sup></italic>) liver. Gene cloning revealed that the 3&#x02032;-coding region of pri-miR-433 served as the promoter region of pri-miR-127. Estrogen related receptor (ERR&#x003b3;, NR3B3) robustly activated miR-433 and miR-127 promoter reporters through ERRE, which was transrepressed by SHP. The strong elevation of miR-433 and miR-127 in Hepa-1 cells correlated with the down-regulation of SHP and up-regulation of ERR&#x003b3;. Ectopic expression of ERR&#x003b3; induced miR-433 and miR-127 expression, which was repressed by SHP coexpression. In contrast, knockdown ERR&#x003b3; decreased miR-433 and miR-127 expression. In addition, the ERR&#x003b3; agonist GSK4716 induced miR-433 and miR-127 expression both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, respectively. In summary, the coupled miR-433 and miR-127 genes were transcribed from independent promoters regulated by nuclear receptors ERR&#x003b3;/SHP in a compact space by using overlapping genomic regions.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>MicroRNAs have emerged recently as a new class of non-protein-coding RNA molecules that have been shown to participate in the regulation of many cellular processes and changes of their expression are frequently observed in human diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1 B2 B3">1&#x02013;3</xref>). Since the discovery of miRNAs, studies have been focused on the function of miRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>) and their post-transcriptional regulation of mRNA targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). A major gap exists regarding how the expression of miRNA genes are regulated by transcription factors including nuclear receptors. This area of study is particularly challenging because little is known about miRNA gene structure and their transcriptional initiation sites.</p><p>Small heterodimer partner (SHP, NROB2) is a unique orphan nuclear receptor and transcriptional repressor that plays important roles in several metabolic diseases and in liver carcinogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8 B9 B10 B11">8&#x02013;11</xref>). Due to lack of DNA-binding domain, SHP is unable to bind directly to its target gene promoter, but exerts its transrepressive effect through physical interaction with its regulatory partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>), including estrogen related receptor (ERR&#x003b3;, NR3B3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). To determine the potential regulatory function of SHP in miRNA gene expression, we conducted miRNA expression profiling using <italic>SHP<sup>&#x02013;/&#x02013;</sup></italic> mice and cloned the primary transcripts encoding miR-433 and miR-127 gene cluster. We for the first time revealed that pri-miR-433 and pri-miR127 were derived from two separate but overlapping genes (manuscript under review). In this study, we characterized the molecular mechanism that controls miR-433 and miR-127 gene transcription. Our study showed that the transcription of miR-433 and miR-127 genes was tightly regulated by ERR&#x003b3; and SHP through independent promoters which used overlapping genomic coding regions. Our results revealed a novel mechanism by which the coupled miR-433 and miR-127 genes were regulated by nuclear receptors in a compact genomic space.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Total RNA isolation and miRNA microarray analysis</title><p>Total RNA with miRNA was isolated from livers of 2-month-old male mice (<italic>n</italic> = 3) using mirVana&#x02122; miRNA Isolation Kit (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA). The RNA quality control was performed using Bioanalyzer 2100. SHP knockouts (<italic>SHP<sup>&#x02013;/&#x02013;</sup></italic>) and wild-type (WT) mice on a pure C57/BL6 background were analysed. The mice were with normal chow diet under feeding conditions.</p><p>MiRNA microarray including labelling, hybridization, image scanning and initial data analysis was carried out by LC sciences (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.LCsciences.com">http://www.LCsciences.com</ext-link>, Houston, TX). All protocols were deposited at ArrayExpress. LC-miRHumanMouseRat-9.1-070207-MRA-1030 array was used which was deposited in MIAMExpress. In brief, arrays are made based &#x003bc;Paraflo microfluidic technology (Atactic Technologies, Houston, TX, USA). On the &#x003bc;Paraflo microfluidic chip, each detection probe consists of a chemically modified nucleotide coding segment complementary to target microRNA (from miRBase, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://microrna.sanger.ac.uk/sequences/">http://microrna.sanger.ac.uk/sequences/</ext-link>) or other RNA (control or customer defined sequences) and a spacer segment of polyethylene glycol to extend the coding segment away from the substrate. The detection probes are made by <italic>in situ</italic> synthesis using photogenerated reagent (PGR) chemistry (Array Protocol: LC Mir-Array-Prtl-060518). Small RNAs (&#x0003c;300 nt) are 3&#x02032;-extended with a poly(A) tail using poly(A) polymerase. An oligonucleotide tag is then ligated to the poly(A) tail for later fluorescent dye staining; two different tags are used for the two RNA samples in dual-sample experiments (Labeling Protocol: LC Mir-Label Prtl-060518). Hybridization is performed using a micro-circulation pump (Atactic Technologies). The hybridization conditions are 100 &#x003bc;l 6 &#x000d7; SSPE buffer (0.90 M NaCl, 60 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 6 mM EDTA, pH 6.8) containing 25% formamide, 34&#x000b0;C and overnight (Hybridization Protocol: LC Mir-Hyb Prtl-060518). Hybridization images are collected using a laser scanner (GenePix 4000B, Molecular Device, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). Scan resolution is set at 10 &#x003bc; and PTM is set between 350 and 700 V (Scanning Protocol: LC Mir-Scan Prtl-060518). Data are analysed by first subtracting the background and then normalization. The background is determined using a regression-based background mapping method. The regression is performed on 5&#x02013;25% of the lowest intensity data points excluding blank spots. Raw data matrix is then subtracted by the background matrix. Normalization is carried out using a LOWESS (Locally weighted Regression) method on the background-subtracted data (Normalization Protocol: LC Mir-Norm Prtl-060518). The data were deposited to the ArrayExpress database and the accession number is E-MEXP-1721.</p></sec><sec><title>Real-time RT&#x02013;PCR quantification of miRNAs</title><p>Real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT&#x02013;PCR) quantification of miRNA expression was carried out using mirVana&#x02122; quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) miRNA Detection Kit (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA) according to manufacturer's protocol. Briefly, cDNAs were synthesized from total RNA using gene-specific primers. Reverse transcription reactions contained 25 ng RNA samples, 1 &#x003bc;l of RT primer, 2 &#x003bc;l of RT buffer and 0.4 &#x003bc;l of ArrayScript Enzyme Mix. The 10 &#x003bc;l reactions were incubated for 30 min at 37&#x000b0;C, 15 min at 95&#x000b0;C, then held at 4&#x000b0;C. Real-time PCR was performed using an Applied Biosystems 7500 sequence detection system. The 25 &#x003bc;l PCR included 10 &#x003bc;l RT product, 12.5 &#x003bc;l of SYBR green mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) and 0.5 U Super <italic>Taq</italic> (Ambion) and 0.5 &#x003bc;l of mirVana PCR primers. Reactions were incubated in a 96-well optical plate at 95&#x000b0;C for 10 min, followed by 45 cycles of 95&#x000b0;C for 15 s and 60&#x000b0;C for 1 min. The threshold cycle (<italic>C</italic>t) was determined using default threshold settings. The <italic>C</italic><sub>t</sub> value is defined as the fractional cycle number at which the fluorescence passes the fixed threshold.

Hela cells were maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium in the presence of 10% fetal bovine serum. Eight additional deletion constructs of pri-miR-127 and pri-miR-433 promoter reporters were generated using eight upstream primers (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn567/DC1">Supplementary Materials</ext-link>). All deletion constructions were verified by sequencing. SHP and ERR&#x003b3; expression vectors are available in our laboratory. For luciferase assays, cells were plated in 24-well plates 1 day before transfection and transfection was carried out using Fugene HD (Roche, Indianapolis, IN, USA). Total DNA in each transfection was adjusted by adding appropriate amounts of pcDNA3 empty vector. Approximately 48 h after transfection, cells were harvested and luciferase activities were measured and normalized against &#x003b2;-galactosidase activities as an internal control. The transfection experiments were carried out independently three times with similar efficiency and one representative result is shown.</p></sec><sec><title>Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays</title><p>The ChIP assays were performed using the ChIP Assay Kit (Upstate Biotechnology, Lake Placid, NY, USA). Hepa-1 cells were cultured until 70&#x02013;80% confluence. Chromatin was cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde at 37&#x000b0;C for 10 min. Cells were washed with cold PBS twice and disrupted in SDS lysis buffer containing the protein inhibitor cocktail. Chromatin was sonicated to shear DNA to an average length between 200 and 1000 bp as verified by agarose gel. The sonicated cell supernatants were diluted 10-fold in ChIP dilution buffer containing the protein inhibitor cocktail and an aliquot of the solution was reserved for input control. Ten micrograms of ERR&#x003b3; antibody (Aviva Systems Biology, San Diego, CA, USA) was added and the chromatin solution was gently rotated overnight on ice. The protein A agarose slurry was added to the antibody-bound chromatin solution and incubated at 4&#x000b0;C for 1 h with constant rotation. The agarose beads were collected by centrifugation, washed and the antibody-bound chromatin was released from the agarose beads. Finally, the DNA was purified by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation.

As expected, the response of the miR-433Luc and miR-127Luc to ERR&#x003b3; was dose-dependent and was strongly repressed by SHP coexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>B), consistent with ERR&#x003b3; being a target for potent SHP repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). <fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><p>Promoter analysis of the miR-433 and miR-127 luciferase reporters.

Inactivation of E2 by deletion the entire ERRE site markedly decreased miR-433 (-1088) Luc activity induced by low (empty bar) and high (filled bar) doses of ERR&#x003b3; (left). The effect of deleting both E1/E2 (-622 and -328Luc) appeared to be no different than that of deleting E2 alone (-1088Luc), whereas the activity of the smallest -92Luc was further decreased. Serial deletion of E2&#x02032; and its surrounding region reduced miR-127 (-990, -713 and -508) Luc activity induced by low doses but not by high doses of ERR&#x003b3; (right). Further deletion of E1&#x02032; significantly decreased -287Luc transactivation. Thus, E2 in the miR-433 promoter and E1&#x02032;/E2&#x02032; in the miR-127 promoter appeared to be potent ERRE sites for ERR&#x003b3; activation. It is noted that deletion both of E1/E2 or E1&#x02032;/E2&#x02032; did not completely block transactivation of either promoter to the basal level, suggesting additional mechanisms for the regulation of the miR-433 and miR-127 promoters.</p><p>ChIP analyses showed that ERR&#x003b3; was physically associated with the endogenous miR-433 and miR-127 promoters in Hepa-1 cells by strong Co-IP at E2 and E1&#x02032; sites, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">Figure 4</xref>A). In contrast, a non-specific primer set located &#x0223c;11 kb downstream of miR-127 promoter did not produce PCR product. In addition, RNAi knockdown ERR&#x003b3; in the cells markedly reduced ERR&#x003b3; binding to the promoters. It has been reported that ERR&#x003b3; can activate ERR&#x003b1; promoter through an ERRE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Thus, ChIP assays were performed on ERR&#x003b1; promoter, which served as a positive control.

Increased expression of ERR&#x003b3; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A, left) and ERR&#x003b2; (Figure S2A), but not ERR&#x003b1;, correlated with the up-regulation of miR-433 and miR-127, as compared with normal hepatocyte Nmuli cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>A, right). Despite increased expression of ERR&#x003b2; in Hepa-1 cells, luciferase activity with the miR-433 and miR-127 promoter constructs was rather weak, thus we consider it as non-responsive (Figure S2B). Thus, ERR&#x003b2; is an unlikely regulator of miR-433 and miR-127 expression. Ectopic overexpression of ERR&#x003b3; in Hepa-1 cells significantly induced both miR-433 and miR-127 expression, which was repressed by coexpression of SHP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>B). Knocking down ERR&#x003b3; in Hepa-1 cells by siRNA (Figure S2C) resulted in a corresponding reduction of miR-127 expression, although the effect on miR-433 was somewhat less efficient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>C).

Co-transfection of SHP dose-dependently inhibited the effect of GSK4716 on ERR&#x003b3; activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5</xref>E). Consistently, activation of ERR&#x003b3; by GSK4716 induced miR-433 expression in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">Figure 6</xref>A, a&#x02032;). The lack of dose response for the miR-127 suggested that miR-127 gene may be more sensitive to GSK4716 and that the lowest dose of GSK4716 that we used may have induced a maximal response (b&#x02032;). Indeed, a dose-responsive activation of miR-127 was observed when a low dose range of GSK4716 was applied (c&#x02032;).

However, essentially all these studies have focused on miRNA regulation of post-transcription of nuclear receptors. Although in one report it was shown that the expression of several miRNAs was altered in nuclear receptor PPAR&#x003b1; knockout mice, the transcriptional mechanism of how PPAR&#x003b1; regulates these miRNAs remains unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). Our study is the first report which characterized the detailed molecular basis for SHP/ERR&#x003b3; controlling miR-433 and miR-127 expression.</p><p>It is noted that the clustered 21 miRNAs on chromosome 12 were all up-regulated in <italic>SHP<sup>&#x02013;/&#x02013;</sup></italic> mice, suggesting that they were directly or indirectly suppressed by SHP. Because we have not cloned all the primary transcripts and promoters for these up-regulated miRNAs, it is currently unknown if these clustered miRNAs are regulated through SHP/ERR&#x003b3; dependent mechanism or through SHP dependent but ERR&#x003b3; independent mechanism. It would be of great interest to investigate in future studies.</p><p>A recent report suggests that the human miR-127 is expressed as part of a miRNA cluster including miR-433 and is processed from a large transcript including all miRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Our data show that the mouse miR-127 and miR-433 are generated from two distinct but overlapping primary transcripts controlled by independent promoters. Our new preliminary data suggest that a similar regulatory mechanism exists in other mammalian species including humans (Song, G.S. and Wang, L., unpublished data). Therefore, miR-433 and miR-127 expression regulation that we identified in mice may represent a conversed mechanism in a variety of mammalian species.</p><p>One interesting question is whether the elements upstream of miR-433 may also regulate miR-127. Eukaryotic gene promoters can have regulatory elements in proximal region or several kilobases away from the transcriptional start site. In general, the proximal promoter contains primary regulatory elements and the distal promoter may contain additional regulatory elements, often with a weaker influence than the proximal promoter. It is possible that the ERREs upstream of the miR-433 TIS start site may also regulate miR-127. Because the sites are over 2 kb away from the TIS of pri-miR127, they may represent weak regulatory elements. Therefore, miR-127 is believed to be primarily regulated by the proximal ERREs between miR-433 TIS and miR-127 TIS. Nevertheless, the results, that the two pri-miRNAs produced from the miR-433-127 locus are transcribed from two separate overlapping genes and the basal expression of pri-miR-127 is much higher than pri-miR-433, strongly suggest that miR-127 and miR-433 are independently and differentially regulated.</p><p>Another question is whether the ERREs in the promoters of miR-433 or miR-127 may also contribute to the increased expression of the flanking miR-431 and miR-343-3p/5p. The question is expected to be addressed upon determining TIS and TTS of both miRs and the cloning of full-length pri-miR-431 and pri-miR-343.</p><p>SHP has been recently shown to function as a tumour suppressor in liver cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). It remains to be determined if miR-127 regulates BCL-6 in HCC, as it does in other human cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). A direct association between SHP, miR-127 and HCC progression is currently under investigation.</p><p>In summary, our identification of the common regulation of miR-433 and miR-127 gene transcription by the nuclear receptors SHP and ERR&#x003b3; and potential differential regulation of miR-433 by other nuclear receptors support the notion of a complex and interactive regulation of miRNA gene expression.</p></sec><sec><title>SUPPLEMENTARY DATA</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/gkn567">Supplementary Data</ext-link> are available at NAR Online.</p></sec><sec><title>FUNDING</title><p>American Liver Foundation/American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (Liver Scholar Award); American Diabetes Association (Junior Faculty Award); American Heart Association (BGIA Award); <grant-sponsor>NIH</grant-sponsor> NIDDK (<grant-num>DK080440</grant-num> to L.W.).
