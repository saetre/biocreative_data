Here, we show that the single-strand break repair protein XRCC1 is rapidly assembled into discrete nuclear foci after oxidative DNA damage at sites of poly (ADP-ribose) synthesis. Poly (ADP-ribose) synthesis peaks during a 10 min treatment with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and the appearance of XRCC1 foci peaks shortly afterwards. Both sites of poly (ADP-ribose) and XRCC1 foci decrease to background levels during subsequent incubation in drug-free medium, consistent with the rapidity of the single-strand break repair process. The formation of XRCC1 foci at sites of poly (ADP-ribose) was greatly reduced by mutation of the XRCC1 BRCT I domain that physically interacts with PARP-1. Moreover, we failed to detect XRCC1 foci in <italic>Adprt1</italic><sup><italic>&#x02013;&#x0002f;&#x02013;</italic></sup> MEFs after treatment with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. These data demonstrate that PARP-1 is required for the assembly or stability of XRCC1 nuclear foci after oxidative DNA damage and suggest that the formation of these foci is mediated via interaction with poly (ADP-ribose). These results support a model in which the rapid activation of PARP-1 at sites of DNA strand breakage facilitates DNA repair by recruiting the molecular scaffold protein, XRCC1.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Single-strand breaks (SSBs) can arise directly (e.g. by fragmentation of damaged deoxyribose) or indirectly (e.g. during the enzymatic excision of abasic sites) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg761c1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg761c2">2</xref>). The importance of repairing SSBs is suggested by the increased spontaneous and&#x0002f;or induced genetic instability of cell lines in which polypeptide components of this process are absent or mutated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg761c3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg761c7">7</xref>). It is likely that, if not repaired, SSBs are converted into DSBs during DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg761c8">8</xref>).</p><p>A critical component of SSBR is the polypeptide XRCC1. Mutant cell lines lacking XRCC1 display hypersensitivity to a broad range of genotoxins, increased frequencies of translocations and deletions, and a reduced ability to rapidly repair chromosomal SSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg761c9">9</xref>). Mice with targeted disruption of both <italic>Xrcc1</italic> alleles exhibit early embryonic lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg761c10">10</xref>). At the molecular level, XRCC1 appears to coordinate or stimulate enzymatic components of SSBR by physical interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg761c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg761c11">11</xref>). XRCC1 interacts with APE1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg761c12">12</xref>), DNA polymerase &#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg761c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg761c14">14</xref>), DNA polynucleotide kinase(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg761c11">11</xref>), and DNA ligase III&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg761c15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg761c18">18</xref>). In addition, XRCC1 also interacts with poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg761c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg761c19">19</xref>).</p><p>PARP-1 rapidly binds to DNA strand breaks (SSBs) and is thereby activated, covalently automodifying itself and, to a lesser extent, proximal acceptor proteins with poly (ADP-ribose) polymer (PAR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg761c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg761c21">21</xref>). XRCC1 preferentially interacts with automodified PARP-1, most likely via a PAR-binding motif present within the internal BRCT I domain of XRCC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg761c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg761c22">22</xref>). Consistent with this, inhibiting PAR synthesis with 3-aminobenzamide greatly reduces or ablates the interaction of XRCC1 with PARP-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg761c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg761c24">24</xref>). These data have prompted the hypothesis that one function of PARP-1 is to recruit XRCC1 to sites of SSBs. In agreement with this, the XRCC1 BRCT I domain is critical for SSBR and for cell survival mediated by XRCC1 after DNA alkylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg761c25">25</xref>). However, evidence that PARP-1 might recruit XRCC1 to SSBs is currently lacking.</p><p>Here, we have addressed the spatial and temporal relationship between PAR synthesis and the assembly of XRCC1 subnuclear foci during the repair of oxidative SSBs induced by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. We show that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> induces the rapid and transient formation of PAR nuclear foci, indicative of the binding and activation of PARP-1 at DNA strand breaks, followed soon after by the appearance of XRCC1 nuclear foci at the same sites. Mutation of the XRCC1 BRCT I domain that interacts with PAR reduces or prevents the appearance of XRCC1 foci, and XRCC1 foci fail to appear after H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in mouse cells harbouring a targeted disruption of the <italic>Adprt1</italic> gene encoding <italic>Parp-1</italic>. These data provide evidence that PARP-1 is required for the recruitment of XRCC1 to sites of chromosomal DNA strand breakage.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Cells and cell culture</title><p>CHO cells were cultured as monolayers in &#x003b1;-MEM (Gibco, Invitrogen Corporation) supplemented with 10&#x00025; fetal calf serum (Gibco).

The CHO cells employed were <italic>XRCC1</italic>-mutant EM9 cells harbouring either empty pCD2E vector (EM9-V cells) or vector encoding human histidine-tagged XRCC1 (EM9-XH cells). The two cell lines were examined for co-localization of XRCC1 and PAR before and after a 20 min treatment with 10 mM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Immunostaining with anti-PAR Mabs revealed discrete nuclear foci in both EM9-V and EM9-XH cells after H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment and these foci were absent from untreated cells, consistent with the rapid activation of PARP at H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced SSBs (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg761f1">1</xref>, red). XRCC1 was similarly detected as nuclear immunofoci after H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment, a large proportion of which co-localized with those of PAR (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg761f1">1</xref>, green and &#x02018;merge&#x02019;). As expected, XRCC1 signal was absent from EM9-V cells harbouring empty vector (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg761f1">1</xref> bottom right panel). Next, the kinetics at which PAR and XRCC1 foci were formed during a 2-h repair-incubation after H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment was examined. The appearance of PAR foci in EM9-XH cells was very rapid, peaking during the 20-min incubation with drug, after which the number of foci-positive cells fell to background within 1 h (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg761f2">2</xref>A, filled squares). The appearance of XRCC1 foci displayed similar kinetics, though these foci peaked a little later, after &#x0223c;10 min of repair-incubation, and persisted longer (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg761f2">2</xref>A, open squares). The rapid and transient formation of PAR and XRCC1 foci is consistent with the kinetics of the rapid SSBR process.</p><p>The observation that XRCC1 foci appeared with slightly delayed kinetics when compared to those of PAR is consistent with the hypothesis that PARP-1 binds DNA strand breaks and is activated, and then recruits XRCC1 to those breaks to facilitate repair. To test whether the formation of XRCC1 foci may reflect the recruitment of XRCC1 by PAR, we examined the formation of XRCC1 foci in EM9-XH<sup>C389A</sup> cells expressing XRCC1 with a mutated BRCT I domain. The kinetics with which PAR foci appeared and disappeared in EM9-XH<sup>C389A</sup> cells was similar to that in EM9-XH cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg761f2">2</xref>A, compare filled squares and filled circles). In contrast, the appearance of XRCC1 foci in EM9-XH<sup>C389A</sup> cells in response to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was reduced in comparison to EM9-XH cells, as measured by the number of foci-positive cells (cells with &#x0003e;6 foci) observed at different times during the repair incubation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg761f2">2</xref>A, compare open circles and open squares). The reduced appearance of XRCC1 foci in EM9-XH<sup>C389A</sup> cells was not explained by lower levels of XRCC1 protein because this mutant cell line exhibited slightly higher levels of XRCC1 than did EM9-XH cells (see later, Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg761f3">3</xref>C).</p><p>EM9-XH<sup>C389A</sup> cells were only slightly more sensitive to MMS and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> than were EM9-XH cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg761f2">2</xref>B). This small effect on survival is in contrast to two other mutations in BRCT I domain that we have examined previously, including one mutation located only four amino acids from C389, which entirely prevents the ability of XRCC1 to maintain cell survival after MMS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg761c25">25</xref>). We therefore examined the impact of these additional BRCT I mutations on assembly of XRCC1 foci. One of the mutations is a double substitution of Leu360&#x0002f;Ileu361 with two Asp residues and the second is a single substitution of Trp385 with Asp (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg761f3">3</xref>A). Similar to C389, Trp385 lies within the PAR binding motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg761c22">22</xref>), and mutation of Leu360 has previously been reported to prevent the interaction between XRCC1 and PARP-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg761c28">28</xref>). The appearance of XRCC1 nuclear foci was reduced in both EM9-XH<sup>LI360&#x0002f;361DD</sup> and EM9-XH<sup>W385D</sup> cells after H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg761f3">3</xref>B). EM9-XH<sup>W385D</sup> cells exhibited the greatest reduction, with &#x0223c;10-fold fewer XRCC1 foci observed 10 min after H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment than was observed in wild-type EM9-XH5 cells. In contrast to the LI360&#x0002f;361DD and W385D mutations, a naturally occurring human polymorphism (XRCC1 399Q) located at the very end of the BRCT I domain did not measurably affect the appearance of XRCC1 foci (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg761f3">3</xref>B). This is consistent with our previous observation that this polymorphism does not measurably impact on SSBR in CHO cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg761c25">25</xref>).</p><p>The BRCT I domain and the linker located between this domain and the C-terminal BRCT II domain are the most evolutionary conserved regions of XRCC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg761c25">25</xref>). Indeed, a putative homologue in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> is comprised of just these domains. We therefore expressed a human equivalent of the <italic>A.thaliana</italic> XRCC1, encoding residues 242&#x02013;533 (see Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg761f3">3</xref>A and C), to examine whether these two evolutionary conserved domains are sufficient to allow assembly of human XRCC1 into nuclear foci. Interestingly, EM9-XH<sup>242&#x02013;533</sup> cells exhibited high levels of XRCC1 foci even in the absence of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, though an increase in foci-positive cells was observed after H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg761f3">3</xref>B). The BRCT I domain and the linker region located downstream of this domain are thus sufficient for assembly of XRCC1 in subnuclear foci, though other domains of XRCC1 may be important to regulate this process. Perhaps consistent with this, XRCC1<sup>242&#x02013;533</sup> failed to correct the sensitivity of EM9 cells to either H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> or MMS (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg761f2">2</xref>B, open squares).</p><p>If PARP-1 activity is required to recruit XRCC1 to sites of SSBs, then XRCC1 should fail to assemble into foci in cells lacking PARP-1. We therefore examined the formation of Xrcc1 foci in MEFs harbouring targeted disruption of exon 1 of the <italic>Adprt-1</italic> gene (from here on termed <italic>Parp1</italic> for clarity) that encodes Parp-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg761c26">26</xref>). As expected, immunostaining with anti-PAR antibodies revealed nuclear foci in <italic>Parp1</italic><sup><italic>&#x0002b;&#x0002f;&#x0002b;</italic></sup> MEFs after H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, but few or no foci in <italic>Parp1</italic><sup><italic>&#x0002b;&#x0002f;&#x0002b;</italic></sup> MEFs before H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> or in <italic>Parp1</italic><sup><italic>&#x02013;&#x0002f;&#x02013;</italic></sup> MEFs after H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg761f4">4</xref>, red). Similarly, Xrcc1 foci formed in <italic>Parp1</italic><sup><italic>&#x0002b;&#x0002f;&#x0002b;</italic></sup> MEFs after H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, and many of these co-localized with PAR (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg761f4">4</xref>, green). Typically, we observed between 10 and 30 Xrcc1&#x0002f;PAR foci per cell. Strikingly, however, Xrcc1 nuclear foci were not detected in <italic>Parp1</italic><sup><italic>&#x02013;&#x0002f;&#x02013;</italic></sup> cells after H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, demonstrating that PARP-1 is required for the appearance of Xrcc1 foci after exposure to this drug. Although the dose of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> employed in these experiments (10 mM) is lethal, similar numbers of Xrcc1 foci-positive cells were observed at lower, more physiological, doses of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in <italic>Parp1</italic><sup><italic>&#x0002b;&#x0002f;&#x0002b;</italic></sup> cells (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkg761f5">5</xref>A and B). Once again, between 10 and 30 foci were typically observed per cell, and these foci were both similar in appearance to those observed after 10 mM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and were similarly co-localized with sites of PAR (data not shown).

A direct physical link between PARP-1 and the DNA strand break repair machinery emerged with the discovery that PARP-1 interacts with the BRCT I domain of XRCC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg761c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg761c19">19</xref>). XRCC1 appears to operate as a molecular scaffold protein that interacts with and stimulates enzymatic components of single strand break repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg761c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg761c31">31</xref>). In this study, we have shown that PARP-1 is required for the rapid appearance of XRCC1 nuclear foci after oxidative damage and that these foci co-localize with sites of PAR synthesis. PAR synthesis was the product of PARP-1 activity because it was absent from MEFs in which <italic>Parp-1</italic> was disrupted. The appearance of XRCC1 foci was dependent upon the central BRCT I domain in this polypeptide, which has been shown previously to interact with PAR polymer and to be critical for the role of XRCC1 in SSBR and for cell survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg761c22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg761c25">25</xref>).</p><p>What are the nature of the breaks at which PARP-1 and XRCC1 foci assemble? Given the extensive involvement of XRCC1 in SSBR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg761c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg761c31">31</xref>), it seems likely that SSBs are responsible for the foci observed after H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, though an involvement of DSBs is possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg761c32">32</xref>). It is likely that the XRCC1&#x0002f;PAR foci reported here are physiologically relevant sites of DNA strand break repair because they rapidly disappeared during a repair incubation in drug-free medium. These foci could reflect the steady state number of DNA strand breaks undergoing repair at the time of fixation, or alternatively could reflect a discrete number of &#x02018;repair factories&#x02019; into which DNA strand breaks are recruited.</p><p>XRCC1 is required for at least two types of SSBR process, a rapid pathway that occurs throughout the cell cycle and a second pathway that is specific for S&#x0002f;G2 phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg761c33">33</xref>). In addition, there exists at least one additional SSBR pathway that is XRCC1 independent. Of the two identified XRCC1-dependent processes, the S&#x0002f;G2 pathway appears to be the most important for cell survival. Indeed, the S&#x0002f;G2 process can largely compensate for absence of the rapid pathway, possibly by removing unrepaired SSBs when they are encountered by the replication fork (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg761c33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg761c34">34</xref>). It is unclear whether the XRCC1&#x0002f;PAR foci observed here are associated with one or both of these processes, though the rapid appearance of PAR foci and XRCC1 foci correlates best with the rapid pathway.</p><p>The requirement for PARP-1 for assembly of XRCC1 foci could be direct, via the ability of these polypeptides to interact. Alternatively, it could reflect an indirect impact of PARP-1 on the expression of other repair genes or on chromatin architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg761c35">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg761c37">37</xref>). However, we favour the model that PARP-1 directly recruits XRCC1 via the binding of PAR polymer to XRCC1, for several reasons. First, XRCC1 interacts preferentially with ribosylated PARP-1 and XRCC1 binds purified PAR polymer <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg761c19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg761c22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg761c24">24</xref>). This strongly suggests that PARP-1 recruits XRCC1 by physical interaction once PAR synthesis is triggered at a DNA strand break. Second, the interaction of XRCC1 with PAR polymer occurs via a motif within the BRCT I domain, mutations within which reduced the formation of XRCC1 foci after oxidative DNA damage. Also, a truncated XRCC1 polypeptide encoding just the BRCT I domain and the linker domain between BRCT I and BRCT II was able to form XRCC1 foci, albeit in an apparently deregulated fashion that may not be responsive to oxidative DNA damage. The difference observed in the impact of the three mutations on foci formation may be due to leakiness, since there is a high degree of redundancy amongst PAR-binding motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg761c22">22</xref>). The LI360&#x0002f;361DD and W385D mutations had the greatest effect on foci formation, reducing their appearance by &#x0223c;3- and 10-fold, respectively. These mutations appear to impact specifically on functions of the BRCT I domain because we have shown previously that they do not prevent protein&#x02013;protein interactions mediated by flanking domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg761c25">25</xref>). Together, these data best support a model in which PARP-1 mediates the assembly of XRCC1 foci after oxidative DNA damage by direct interaction of the XRCC1 BRCT I domain with PAR polymer, thereby recruiting XRCC1 to sites of DNA strand breakage.</p><p>A requirement for PARP-1 for recruiting XRCC1 to strand breaks during DNA repair reactions <italic>in vitro</italic> has not been reported. This may reflect that the active recruitment of XRCC1 to breaks is not required for repair in simple cell-free reactions, because the high concentration of DNA breaks and soluble repair factors in such experiments prevent the detection of DNA breaks from being a rate limiting step. However, active recruitment of XRCC1 and its protein partners may be important to accelerate the detection and repair of SSBs within the context of the nuclear genome, in which DNA breaks are relatively rare and distributed amongst many kilobases of undamaged DNA. It is also possible that the recruitment of XRCC1 is important for repair of chromatin, rather than naked plasmid DNA or oligonucleotide duplex.</p><p>We have suggested that PARP-1 may primarily be required to recruit XRCC1 to direct DNA breaks, which are &#x02018;un-scheduled&#x02019; and require rapid detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg761c31">31</xref>). It is feasible that PARP-1 also recruits XRCC1 to SSBs arising during BER, since both PAR and XRCC1 foci were absent from <italic>Parp1</italic><sup><italic>&#x02013;&#x0002f;&#x02013;</italic></sup> MEFs after exposure to the alkylating agent, MMS. However, it is more difficult to envisage a need for PARP to &#x02018;detect&#x02019; breaks during early stages of BER, since current models suggest that breaks created by APE1 can be passed directly to DNA polymerase &#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg761c38">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg761c40">40</xref>) which in turn may itself then recruit XRCC1&#x0002f;DNA ligase III&#x003b1; for the completion of DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg761c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg761c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg761c31">31</xref>). Perhaps PAR synthesis after base damage reflects binding by PARP-1 to SSBs at a later stage of BER, since PARP-1 may influence the choice of whether short patch or long patch repair is employed during DNA gap filling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg761c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg761c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg761c41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkg761c42">42</xref>). Alternatively, PAR synthesis after base damage could reflect a fraction of abasic sites that become &#x02018;uncoupled&#x02019; from APE1 after cleavage or that are cleaved by an AP lyase activity, either of which might be expected to result in &#x02018;exposed&#x02019; SSBs that require rapid detection by PARP-1.</p><p>In summary, these data show that PARP-1 is required for assembly or stability of XRCC1 nuclear foci after oxidative DNA damage, consistent with a model in which poly (ADP-ribose) synthesis serves to recruit XRCC1 to sites of DNA strand breakage.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkg761f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Co-localization of XRCC1 foci at sites of poly (ADP-ribose) synthesis after oxidative DNA damage.
