Finally, we extend the striking similarities in compromising either Notch signaling or AP-2&#x003b1;/AP-2&#x003b3; in developing skin to that in postnatal skin, where all hair follicles and sebaceous gland differentiation are also repressed and overt signs of premalignant conversion emerge.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes><fn-group><fn><p>Abbreviations used in this paper: 1&#x000b0;MK, primary mouse epidermal keratinocytes; C/EBP, CCAAT/enhancer binding protein; cKO, conditional knockout; DcKO, double cKO; DKO, double knockout; DP, dermal papilla; E, embryonic day; EGFR, EGF receptor; HF, hair follicle; NICD, Notch intracellular domain; P0, postnatal day 0; shRNA, short hairpin RNA; WT, wild type.</p></fn></fn-group></notes></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>In mouse, skin begins as a single layer of surface ectoderm from which the adult epidermis and its appendages develop.

As mesenchyme populates the skin, localized interactions occur, initiating specialized morphogenetic programs that lead to hair follicle (HF) morphogenesis and epidermal stratification. By embryonic day (E) 14.5, epidermis is two cell layers thick that are characterized by K5/K14 in the basal layer and K1/K10 in suprabasal (spinous) cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fuchs and Green, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Byrne et al., 1994</xref>). By E16.5&#x02013;17.5, several layers of spinous cells are capped by emergence of a morphologically distinct granular layer, marked by expression of late stage differentiation markers, including transglutaminases, loricrin, and filaggrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rothnagel et al., 1987</xref>). Just before birth, epidermal maturation concludes, as outermost cells lose their cellular organelles, transglutaminases are activated, and lipid bilayers are extruded to sandwich the dead stratum corneum layers. Postnatally, the stratum corneum provides a functional barrier to protect animals from dehydration and infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Segre, 2006</xref>).</p><p>Adult epidermis undergoes constant turnover and repair by maintaining within the basal layer a resident population of stem cells that are able to both proliferate and execute the suprabasal terminal differentiation program. Homeostasis is maintained by a continual flux of basal cells departing from their proliferative compartment, committing to terminally differentiate, moving outward, and being sloughed from the skin surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Blanpain and Fuchs, 2006</xref>). The balance between epidermal growth and differentiation must be intricately controlled, and many key changes regulating this transition take place at the basal to suprabasal juncture. Transcription factors CCAAT/enhancer binding protein (C/EBP) &#x003b1; and &#x003b2; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nerlov, 2007</xref>) as well as Notch receptor signaling have been implicated in governing cell fate within spinous cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Maytin et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhu et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dai and Segre, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Okuyama et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blanpain et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Since early discoveries of AP-2 transcription factor binding sites in promoters of many epidermally expressed genes, AP-2 proteins have been implicated in epidermal biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Leask et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Snape et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Byrne et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zeng et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Maytin et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sinha et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Luo et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Panteleyev et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vernimmen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Koster et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang et al., 2006</xref>). The functions of AP-2&#x003b1; and AP-2&#x003b3; have been postulated to be active in mouse surface ectoderm by E9.5, i.e., before K5 and K14 are induced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Byrne et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Koster et al., 2006</xref>). How AP-2 proteins function in epidermis has been less clear, nor is much known about the regulation of these transcription factors. Both basal and suprabasal genes possess AP-2 binding sites, and both positive and negative activities have been observed in vitro, depending on the particular AP-2, gene, and cell type used in the study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Byrne et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sinha et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dai and Segre, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Eckert et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Koster et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nagarajan et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>To date, the best genetic evidence in support of a major role for AP-2s in vertebrate epidermal biology stems from AP-2 morpholino knockdowns in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> oocytes, where neurogenesis becomes promoted at the expense of epidermal fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Luo et al., 2002</xref>). Difficulties in dissecting AP-2 functions in mammalian skin have been compounded by their broad expression and physiological importance to many tissues, often resulting in embryonic or early neonatal lethality when targeted for ablation. Individual conditional targeting of AP-2&#x003b1; and more recently AP-2&#x003b3;, two abundantly expressed AP-2 family members in skin, has been only modestly informative. K14-Cre conditional targeting of AP-2&#x003b1; resulted in normal epidermal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang et al., 2006</xref>), as expected because AP-2&#x003b1; null mice survive until birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhang et al., 1996</xref>). Postnatally, epidermis lacking AP-2&#x003b1; also appeared morphologically normal, although a target gene, EGF receptor (EGFR), was elevated in spinous layers. Abnormalities were only unmasked when skin was stimulated by EGFR ligands, resulting in excessive localized hyperproliferation. Together, these results hinted that without AP-2&#x003b1;, even though epidermal development and homeostasis are maintained, the balance may be precarious (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang et al., 2006</xref>). Similarly, Sox2-Cre ablation of AP-2&#x003b3; resulted in a transient developmental delay in epidermal stratification, but by birth AP-2&#x003b3; null epidermis appeared morphologically and biochemically normal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guttormsen et al., 2008</xref>). Documentation and further dissection of the possible role for AP-2&#x003b3; in epidermis were not possible because the mice had neural tube closure and osteogenesis defects and died soon after parturition.</p><p>By conditionally removing functional redundancies of AP-2 family members in skin, we've now uncovered and characterized previously masked but critical functions of AP-2 transcription factors in epidermal differentiation and barrier function acquisition.

DcKO animals were less than half the size of single cKO mice and exhibited signs of severe dehydration (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>). Notably, DcKO pups lacked visible whiskers (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>).</p><p>Histological analyses revealed additional abnormalities (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref>). In contrast to epidermis from either of the singly targeted mice, the three discrete stages of terminal differentiation&#x02014;spinous, granular, and stratum corneum layers&#x02014;were all noticeably diminished in DcKO epidermis. Ultrastructurally, spinous cells lacked dense networks of keratin filament bundles that typify this early stage of differentiation. In granular layers, keratohyalin granules were morphologically abnormal (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E</xref>, bottom).</p><p>Because animals deteriorated rapidly after birth, appeared to be severely dehydrated at death, and exhibited gross perturbations in terminal differentiation, we surmised that the barrier function might be compromised.

Barrier acquisition in DcKO animals, however, was not complete in E18.5 DcKO embryos, revealing a pattern more closely resembling that of E17.5 WT embryos (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 F</xref>).

DcKO epidermis displayed reduced immunolabeling for markers of both spinous (K1) and granular (involucrin and filaggrin) layers (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). As judged by real-time PCR analyses, the defects in terminal differentiation were at the level of gene expression and were global, encompassing many epidermal genes encoding major structural proteins, including spinous keratins, cornified envelope proteins, and transglutaminase cross-linking proteins used in barrier formation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>). These molecular defects became even more pronounced as DcKO embryos came to term (Fig. S1, A and B, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200804030/DC1">http://www.jcb.org/cgi/content/full/jcb.200804030/DC1</ext-link>).</p><p>In contrast to marked perturbations in terminal differentiating cells, the basal layer of DcKO embryos appeared largely unaffected morphologically and biochemically.

This said, FACS quantifications of short-term BrdU incorporation revealed an &#x0223c;2&#x000d7; reduction in overall number of labeled basal cells in embryonic DcKO versus WT skin (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>). This defect did not appear to be attributable to alterations in apoptosis, as antibodies against active caspase 3 did not detect signs of apoptosis in either DcKO or WT epidermis (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D</xref>).</p><p>The consequences of AP-2&#x003b1; and AP-2&#x003b3; loss in vivo were recapitulated when primary mouse epidermal keratinocytes (1&#x000b0;MK) were propagated in vitro.

In contrast, even though low Ca<sup>2&#x0002b;</sup> media is only weakly permissive for terminal differentiation, this was largely abrogated in DKO 1&#x000b0;MK, which expressed only 10&#x02013;25% mRNA levels of <italic>K1</italic>, <italic>K10</italic>, <italic>Tgm1</italic>, and <italic>Tgm3</italic> compared with their WT counterparts (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 E</xref>).

Expression of both early (<italic>K1</italic> and <italic>K10</italic>) and late (<italic>Loricrin</italic> and <italic>Filaggrin</italic>) genes of terminal differentiation were dramatically suppressed in DKO keratinocytes in vitro. These observations suggest that the impairment in epidermal barrier function reflects an intrinsic and fundamental flaw in the ability of DKO keratinocytes to transcriptionally regulate terminal differentiation.

Perhaps most striking in this regard was the aberrant expression of K8 protein and mRNA in suprabasal layers of DcKO embryonic skin (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3, A and B</xref>). K8 is normally synthesized by transient surface periderm cells that disappear as embryonic epidermis matures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fuchs, 2007</xref>).

When <italic>AP-2&#x003b1;</italic> was reexpressed, <italic>C/EBP&#x003b1;</italic> levels were restored in their entirety, confirming that loss of AP-2 underlies this change. Correspondingly, expression of both <italic>K1</italic> and <italic>K10</italic> genes was also enhanced by AP-2 reexpression.

Moreover, E18.5 DcKO guard HFs still expressed markers of HF maturation: companion layer (K6&#x0002b;), IRS (Gata3&#x0002b;), and hair shaft precursor (AE15&#x0002b;; Fig. S2 B and Fig. S4, D and F). That said, guard hair development initiates early and perhaps precedes strong <italic>K14</italic> promoter activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Vasioukhin et al., 1999</xref>). In contrast, newborn DcKO animals did not form visible whiskers (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 C</xref>), implying a defect in HF differentiation when AP-2&#x003b1; and AP-2&#x003b3; are missing.</p><p>To explore further the possible importance of AP-2s in HF differentiation, we engrafted E18.5 skins onto the backs of <italic>Nude</italic> mice immunocompromised and defective in HF morphogenesis. In WT grafts, hair formation was already visible at day 13, when the bandages were removed. In contrast, DcKO grafts displayed no visible hairs even 45 d after grafting (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 A</xref>). Histological examinations revealed large degenerating cysts, densely filled with small cells of hyperchromatic nuclei (<xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">Fig. 7 B</xref>). These cysts lacked hair shaft structures and displayed a paucity of hair differentiation markers, such as AE13 and Gata3, but aberrant expression of <italic>K8</italic> and increased active caspase 3 (Fig. S4, B, G, and H; and not depicted). Oil Red O staining was largely missing in the epithelium of DcKO grafted skins, indicating that sebaceous gland differentiation was also impaired in the absence of AP-2 (Fig. S4 I).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Dissecting how AP-2 functions in epidermal biology has awaited unmasking the layers of functional redundancy that are caused by the multiplicity of AP-2 factors expressed in skin. By conditionally targeting the two most abundantly expressed <italic>AP-2</italic> genes, we've discovered that AP-2 factors play a prominent role in the master regulatory switch at the basal&#x02013;suprabasal juncture. The central participation of AP-2 transcription in the molecular trigger that coaxes basal epidermal cells to initiate terminal differentiation adds a newfound physiologically significance to this family of transcription factors in epidermal development and homeostasis. The additional marked defects in sebaceous gland and HF differentiation that arise from loss of AP-2&#x003b1; and AP-2&#x003b3; further unveil and expand the importance of these proteins in repressing multiple differentiation lineages within the skin.</p><p>Surprisingly, despite striking perturbations in terminal differentiation-specific gene expression arising from loss of AP-2&#x003b1; and AP-2&#x003b3;, we did not observe marked alterations in basal gene expression at least in development and homeostasis. This was both surprising and unexpected based on single <italic>AP-2&#x003b1;</italic> or <italic>AP-2&#x003b3;</italic> null phenotypes and on the presence of functional AP-2 sites within the <italic>K14</italic> and <italic>K5</italic> promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Leask et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Byrne et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sinha et al., 2000</xref>). It is possible that other AP-2 family members expressed in skin might function in regulating basal fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sinha et al., 2000</xref>). Additionally, based on our discovery that K14/K5 is expanded suprabasally in engrafted skins that lack AP-2&#x003b1; and AP-2&#x003b3;, it is tempting to speculate that suprabasal K14/K5 might be a component of a hyperproliferative feedback mechanism triggered when the terminal differentiation process is perturbed.</p><p>Other major functions unveiled from our double loss of function are previously masked roles for AP-2&#x003b1; and AP-2&#x003b3; in HF maturation and sebaceous gland differentiation. HFs were dramatically altered in their angling, morphology, and differentiation in AP-2 DcKO animals. In addition, expression of terminal differentiation-specific genes for HF was markedly suppressed. The degeneration of HFs into cystlike structures was accompanied by elevated levels of apoptosis, suggesting that AP-2&#x003b1; and AP-2&#x003b3; also likely operate at the transition between proliferation and differentiation of HF progenitors and maintain a normal HF differentiation program.</p><p>One of the most striking features of skin lacking AP-2&#x003b1; and AP-2&#x003b3; was its resemblance to skin compromised for Notch signaling through loss of RBP/J. This was true not only for epidermis, but also HFs and sebaceous glands, all known to be regulated by Notch signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Okuyama et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Blanpain and Fuchs, 2006</xref>). Moreover, the parallels extended to the gross hyperproliferation and premalignant states observed postnatally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nicolas et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blanpain et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lee et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Although no such connections between AP-2 and Notch have previously been described in vertebrates, our results were intriguing in light of genetic studies that placed the single <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> AP-2 gene downstream of Notch signaling in joint and leg development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kerber et al., 2001</xref>). Similar to what we observed in mouse skin, fly joints harboring loss- or gain-of-function mutations in either dAP-2 or Notch exhibited similar phenotypes. However, in this fly tissue, a linear pathway was suggested, based on the ability of activated Notch to induce <italic>dAP-2</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kerber et al., 2001</xref>). The loss of dAP-2 did not affect epidermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Monge et al., 2001</xref>), although it is notable that fly epidermis exists as only a single layer of cells that secrete their cuticle rather than undergo a terminal differentiation program to form a barrier to the body surface.</p><p>In mouse skin, the existence of multiple AP-2 and Notch signaling pathway members seems to have added several additional and interesting layers of complexities to what appears to be an ancient regulatory mechanism. As in fly joints, where loss of dAP-2 did not perturb Notch's ability to activate its target genes (<italic>big brain</italic> and <italic>E(spl)</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kerber et al., 2001</xref>), Notch signaling was still intact in AP-2 DKO mouse keratinocytes, as indicated by the ability of NICD to induce its classical target genes <italic>Hes1</italic> and <italic>Hey1</italic>. We also observed a severalfold induction of AP-2&#x003b3; by NICD expression. However, AP-2&#x003b1; showed little or no change in response to NICD, and neither of these AP-2 factors exhibited appreciable down-regulation when <italic>RBP/J</italic> expression was ablated in keratinocytes. Rather, the inability of Notch to elicit its full effects on epidermal terminal differentiation in mice lacking these AP-2 factors appeared to be rooted at least in part in the loss of <italic>C/EBP</italic> transcription, which in turn works concomitantly with AP-2 factors to orchestrate a complex program of gene expression necessary to produce the epidermal barrier. Although our data strongly support a parallel relationship, the slightly reduced expression of <italic>RBP/J</italic> in AP-2 DKO keratinocytes raises the possibility that cross talk does exist between AP-2 and Notch, and this could impact <italic>C/EBP</italic> as well as other downstream gene expression.</p><p>Although exploration into the mechanisms underlying AP-2 and epidermal appendage formation is beyond the scope of the present study, it is intriguing that both C/EBP&#x003b1; and C/EBP&#x003b2; display strong nuclear localization in sebocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bull et al., 2002</xref>; unpublished data), and both C/EBPs and AP-2s also function in adipocyte differentiation and lipid metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jiang et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Otto and Lane, 2005</xref>). This opens the possibility that AP-2 transcription factors and Notch signaling may also converge on C/EBPs to regulate differentiation and lipid metabolism of these lineages. In contrast, neither C/EBP&#x003b1; nor C/EBP&#x003b2; was detected in the differentiating layers of HFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bull et al., 2002</xref>; unpublished data), suggesting that some other downstream targets mediate the effects of AP-2 transcription factors and Notch signaling in HF lineage differentiation.</p><sec><title>Concluding remarks</title><p>Nearly two decades after their initial discovery in epidermis and the subsequent widespread occurrence of AP-2 binding sites in epidermal promoters, major functions for AP-2 factors in mammalian skin epithelium are starting to emerge. Although further layers of redundancy are likely to unravel additional interesting roles for AP-2s in skin biology, the loss of AP-2&#x003b1; and AP-2&#x003b3; has already unmasked a hitherto unexpected link between AP-2 transcription factors and Notch signaling in a mammalian tissue. Previously only observed in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kerber et al., 2001</xref>), this surprising connection between Notch and AP-2 in a mammalian tissue now highlights the existence of an ancient molecular link that over evolution has been elaborated on greatly. Given the widespread involvement of both Notch signaling and AP-2 expression in many cell types and tissues, these findings merit further investigation in the future.</p><p>Based on the evolutionary and/or tissue-specific differences already noted between the action of dAP-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kerber et al., 2001</xref>) and mammalian AP-2&#x003b1; and AP-2&#x003b3; (this study) and the findings that AP-2s can act as either transcriptional repressors or activators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pfisterer et al., 2002</xref>), it is both plausible and likely that additional complexities in transcriptional activities of AP-2s and their tissue- and differentiation stage&#x02013;dependent contexts will emerge as more studies are conducted.</p><p>Finally, it is interesting to speculate that the mechanism underlying the hyperproliferative feedback pathway that seems to operate when the epidermal barrier is compromised may involve a precariously elevated EGFR signaling sensor that arises from differences in AP-2 levels/expression. If true, this notion would help to explain the confusing and often opposing correlations in expression levels of AP-2 family members in human cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pellikainen and Kosma, 2007</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Mice</title><p><italic>K14-Cre/AP-2&#x003b1;<sup>lox/lox</sup></italic> cKO (&#x003b1;-cKO) mice were generated as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang et al.
