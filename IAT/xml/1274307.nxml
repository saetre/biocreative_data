Mammals have three Dnmt3 genes; Dnmt3a, Dnmt3b, and Dnmt3L, two of which encode active enzymes and one of which produces an inactive but necessary cofactor. However, due to multiple promoter use and alternative splicing there are actually a number of dnmt3 isoforms present. Six different dnmt3 genes have recently been identified in zebrafish.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>We have examined two of the dnmt3 genes in zebrafish that are located in close proximity in the same linkage group and we find that the two genes are more similar to each other than they are to the other zebrafish dnmt3 genes.

The presence of alternative splice and start sites, reminiscent of what is seen with the human DNMT3s, demonstrates strong parallels between the control/function of these genes across vertebrate species. The dynamic expression levels of these genes/variants suggest that they may well play a role in early development and this is particularly true for dnmt3-2-1 and dnmt3-1. dnmt3-2-1 is the predominantly expressed form prior to zygotic gene activation whereas dnmt3-1 predominates post zygotic gene activation suggesting a distinct developmental role for each.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>The epigenetic modification of DNA by the addition of a methyl group to the 5 position of cytosine is an important mechanism for control of gene expression in vertebrates. This is particularly true during development where DNA methylation is thought to have a role in genome imprinting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], X inactivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] and lineage determination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Methylation has been most intensely studied in mammals where the levels have been shown to be quite dynamic during early development, decreasing soon after fertilization and increasing again by the gastrula stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The importance of this de-methylation/re-methylation cycle to the developmental process has been clearly demonstrated by perturbations of that methylation that generally leads to embryonic lethality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Given the importance of methylation in sustaining normal early developmental processes, the enzymes that add and maintain that methylation are of significant interest. The dnmt3 family of methyltransferases that are thought to be important in <italic>de novo </italic>methylation (that is the addition of methyl groups to previously unmethylated sequences) are of particular interest in this context. There are three members of this family in mammals; two have catalytic activity, Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b; and the third, Dnmt3L, is important as a cofactor, particularly for the methylation of imprinted loci [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Functionally, however, the dnmt3 family is not limited to just three products because both the <italic>Dmnt3a </italic>and <italic>b </italic>transcripts can be alternatively spliced to generate a number of different RNAs. <italic>Dnmt3a </italic>has two splice variants differing in the 5' region whereas <italic>dnmt3b </italic>has a number of possible splicing products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. These variations in the dnmt3 proteins may allow for a greater diversity in the function and/or targets of these enzymes.</p><p>Methylation in zebrafish has recently been the focus of a number of reports, and methylation has been found to be dynamic during its early development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Also, as in mammals, blocking re-methylation in zebrafish results in abnormal development and death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><p>The zebrafish actually has at least twice the mammalian number of dnmt3 genes; six have been submitted to databases so far (GenBank numbers <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AB196914">AB196914</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AB196915">AB196915</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AB196916">AB196916</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AB196917">AB196917</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AB196918">AB196918</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AB196919">AB196919</ext-link>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The significance of the increase in dnmt3 gene copy number in zebrafish is unknown.</p><p>We have isolated and analysed a number of the zebrafish dnmt3 gene sequences and have identified two dnmt3 sequences that are located very close together in a single linkage group. The very close proximity of the two sequences provides an interesting opportunity to examine how the expression of these genes is controlled since one copy has a very limited upstream promoter region relative to the other.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and Discussion</title><p>We used a dnmt3 sequence already present in the zebrafish EST database (GenBank number <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AF135438">AF135438</ext-link>) to identify and isolate the complete cDNA sequences of four of the dnmt3 genes found in the zebrafish. Three of these are located in the same linkage group (linkage group 23) and two of them very closely juxtaposed to each other (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). The very close proximity of those two genes has some interesting implications with respect to their origin and the control of their expression, given the much more limited potential promoter region of one relative to the other. We, therefore, undertook a closer examination of the two genes, which we named dnmt3-1 and dnmt3-2.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>The dnmt3 genes in zebrafish</bold>.

Since there is only a small amount of 5' sequence that is associated with the dnmt3-2 gene this limits the control of the expression of this gene to a small and easily manipulated region. Analysis of this region suggests that it is a TATA-less promoter with a number of potential transcription factor binding sites including AP1 and SP1 binding sites which have also been reported for mammalian Dnmt3s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The sequence of the cloned genes, dnmt3-1 and dnmt3-2 revealed open reading frames that could encode polypeptides of 1447 and 1297 amino acids, respectively. Comparison of the sequences of these two genes to zebrafish genomic maps present in the Genbank database allows for an analysis of the genomic structure. That structure along with the relative position of the two genes is shown in figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>. The two genes are very similar in sequence; 72% at the nucleotide level and 74% identical at the amino acid level, with large regions being more than 80% identical (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). This is in contrast to only 19&#x02013;28% similarity at the nucleotide level, and 36&#x02013;46% amino acid similarity when compared to the other dnmt3 sequences present in the zebrafish genome. This trend is also true for the conserved methyltransferase motifs. For instance, the PWWP motif of gene 1 and gene 2 are 88% and 84% similar at the amino acid and nucleotide levels, respectively, but considerably less similar to the other dnmt3 sequences (<italic>e.g</italic>. dnmt3-2 vs gene 4, accession #196918, has 64% and no significant similarity at the amino acid and nucleotide levels, respectively) (BLAST, NCBI)).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Homology between Gene 1 and Gene 2 at the nucleotide level</bold>. Percentages above 80% are shaded, and specific homology percentages are provided below the figure (numbers obtained by BLAST alignment, NCBI). Arrows span the nucleotides that give rise to the identified motifs labelled above the respective arrows. Note: All identified motifs are characteristic of the C-5 methyltransferases, with the exception of the CH domain.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-213X-5-23-2"/></fig><p>Recent additions to the sequence databases included two zebrafish sequences that appear to correspond to the same two genes and were named dnmt3 and dnmt5 respectively (GenBank numbers <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AB196914">AB196914</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="AB196916">AB196916</ext-link>). Our sequencing data corroborate the sequences submitted to the databases except for a few minor variations in regions with triplet repeats which may be an artefact of polymerase slippage in cloning or represent real triplet repeat differences that exist in the gene.</p><p>The high homology between dnmt3-1 and dnmt3-2 relative to other zebrafish dnmt3's, as well as their close proximity, suggests that these genes represent a duplication event. Postlethwait <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] provides support for a model where two polyploidization events occurred in a common ancestor of zebrafish and mammals. However, there are often additional multigene members in zebrafish. Postlethwait <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] argues that either chromosome duplication or another tetraploidization event in the zebrafish lineage is the most likely mechanisms by which these additional members arose. The tight clustering seen here, however, suggests that, at least in this instance, tandem gene duplication has occurred.</p><p>The most interesting aspect of our analyses is that at least one of the genes, dnmt3-2, includes at least two start sites and a number of splice variants. These were initially identified in cDNA libraries generated from 1&#x02013;2 cell embryos and RACE-PCR and were later confirmed by RT-PCR in a number of early embryonic zebrafish stages as well as somatic tissues (figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>). This demonstrates that they are all expressed at least to the level of RNA. Densitometric analysis revealed that the transcript levels are not equivalent and that the relative levels of the different genes and isoforms fluctuate independently between the stages examined (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>). All genes and variants examined are expressed in early embryonic stages, though dnmt-3-2-1 appears to be the most significant prior to zygotic gene activation (zygotic gene activation occurs at ~3 hours). All transcripts demonstrated declining levels leading up to this event, suggesting maternal supply turnover. Following zygotic gene activation however, there appears to be a marked shift towards dnmt3-1 being the most highly expressed. Additionally, there appears to be tissue dependent differences in expression levels (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). These differences in expression profiles for the different gene products and isoforms suggest that they are regulated independently and each may be playing distinct and separate roles during the development of the zebrafish.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>dnmt3 isoforms</bold>.

The genomic structure is presented on the top line, with the 5' region of interest magnified below illustrating the various alternative splicing products. Transcript 1 (line 2) differs from the others by an alternate transcriptional start site and a missing exon 2. Transcripts two (line 3) and three (line 4) lack the first exon and are alternatively spliced in the second exon (the one missing from transcript 1). All splice variants occur upstream of the AUG start site.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-213X-5-23-5"/></fig><p>The shortest of these variants, dnmt3-2-1, corresponds to the dnmt5 sequence in the database. The two novel variants reported here differ in size from that sequence by 187 (dnmt3-2-2) and 265 (dnmt3-2-2b) base pairs. These variants are actually associated with the gene having the most restricted promoter region. A schematic of the three products is shown in figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>.</p><p>There are several interesting aspects of these dnmt3-2 variants. To begin with, although the splicing difference between variant dnmt3-2-2 and dnmt3-2-2b appears to involve the same 3' splice junction it has a different 5' splice junction, meaning that one of those splice sites is located within the exon of the other variant. However, both of the junctions still abide by the GT/AG rule for splice junctions.</p><p>The second interesting aspect of these splice variants is that all of them are 5' to the initiator AUG. Therefore, none of them actually affect the amino acid sequence. This suggests that either the splicing differences are trivial or they play a regulatory role in the translation or localization or some other aspect of the various splice variants. The latter possibility is a more reasonable assumption since, parsimoniously, it seems unreasonable to assume that this RNA would be alternatively spliced in a variety of ways for no biologically relevant reason. This situation is not unique to zebrafish dnmt3 genes. Similar splice variants in the 5'untranslated region have also been reported for human DNMT3s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have isolated and analysed several of the dnmt3 genes from the zebrafish. In this report we have focused on two of the genes that are located in close proximity in a single linkage group and we find that the two genes are considerably more similar to each other than they are to the other zebrafish dnmt3 genes. This suggests that they arose as a result of a relatively recent gene duplication event. We have also found evidence for the existence of several different splice variants and alternative splice sites associated with one of the two genes, reminiscent of what is seen with the human DNMT3s. Expression analyses of these genes and variants demonstrate that are dynamic during development with distinct patterns that suggest they are independently controlled and, possibly, have different functions in development.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Total RNA was isolated from ovarian tissue using the phenol/chloroform method of Chomczynski and Sacchi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].
