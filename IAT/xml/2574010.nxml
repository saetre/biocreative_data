To investigate how host cell signal transduction pathways affect hepatocyte infection, we used RNAi to systematically test the entire kinome and associated genes in human Huh7 hepatoma cells for their potential roles during infection by <italic>P. berghei</italic> sporozoites. The three-phase screen covered 727 genes, which were tested with a total of 2,307 individual siRNAs using an automated microscopy assay to quantify infection rates and qRT-PCR to assess silencing levels. Five protein kinases thereby emerged as top hits, all of which caused significant reductions in infection when silenced by RNAi. Follow-up validation experiments on one of these hits, PKC&#x003c2; (PKCzeta), confirmed the physiological relevance of our findings by reproducing the inhibitory effect on <italic>P. berghei</italic> infection in adult mice treated systemically with liposome-formulated PKC&#x003c2;-targeting siRNAs. Additional cell-based analyses using a pseudo-substrate inhibitor of PKC&#x003c2; added further RNAi-independent support, indicating a role for host PKC&#x003c2; on the invasion of hepatocytes by sporozoites. This study represents the first comprehensive, functional genomics-driven identification of novel host factors involved in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> sporozoite infection.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>During a mammalian malaria infection, <italic>Plasmodium</italic> sporozoites injected by an infected mosquito travel to the liver where they invade hepatocytes and multiply into thousands of new parasites. These newly formed merozoites are then released into the bloodstream where they infect red blood cells and cause the symptoms of the disease. Although asymptomatic, the liver stage of malaria is an obligatory step in the parasite's lifecycle and constitutes an appealing target for prophylatic intervention. The marked tropism of sporozoites for hepatocytes suggests the latter may provide the parasite with a molecular environment that it can exploit to its own benefit. The identification of host factors that influence hepatic infection can thus provide clues for potential anti-malarial strategies. To this end, we carried out an RNA interference screen of the entire human kinome and associated signaling molecules and assessed the effect of knockdown of their expression in the infection of a human hepatoma cell line by <italic>Plasmodium</italic>. This strategy identified at least 5 kinases whose down-regulation leads to a marked decrease in infection. Further characterisation of one of these proteins, PKC&#x003b6;, confirmed that it plays a role in infection by influencing the parasite's invasion of the host liver cells.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="15"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Although malaria has long been a devastating killer for the most vulnerable populations in countries of sub-Saharan Africa and other developing nations, our understanding of the early host-parasite interactions underlying this infectious disease remains far from complete. In fact, the first stage of a malaria infection, which occurs in the liver once the <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasite has been delivered through the bite of an infected female <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquito, is still clearly under-studied today.</p><p>Once inside the mammalian host, <italic>Plasmodium</italic> sporozoites, the motile form that is delivered in the mosquito's saliva, display a marked tropism for hepatocytes, the cells that enable the remarkable replication process that will give rise to thousands of merozoites from each invading parasite (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000201-Prudencio1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>). As a first step towards infection, several hepatocytes are transiently traversed by the sporozoite before one cell is productively invaded, leading to the formation of a parasitophorous vacuole <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000201-Mota1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>. Within this cytosolic vacuole, the subsequent development and asexual replication of <italic>Plasmodium</italic>, constituting so-called exoerythrocytic forms (EEFs), achieve one of the fastest growth rates among all eukaryotic cells. The invaded hepatocyte eventually releases thousands of mature merozoites into the bloodstream <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000201-Sturm1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>, where these then invade erythrocytes, thereby initiating the so-called blood stage of infection and triggering the well-known symptoms of malaria. Both the strong tropism and obligate nature of the events that take place during liver infection suggest an essential requirement for hepatocyte-specific factors in enabling this complex lead-up to the blood stage. It is therefore of primary interest to identify and characterize the role of such host factors, as these may contribute to the design of rational interventional strategies for the development of novel prophylactic agents.</p><p>To this end, we have used a cultured cell-based assay to study the process of liver infection by <italic>Plasmodium</italic> parasites at the cellular and molecular level. Using human Huh7 hepatoma cells and sporozoites of the rodent parasite <italic>P. berghei</italic> freshly isolated from infected <italic>Anopheles</italic> mosquitoes, we have established a high throughput assay system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000201-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) that, combined with high content readouts using automated microscopy, and quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR), can be used for RNA interference (RNAi) and/or drug screening experiments. Intracellular phosphorylation and dephosphorylation events are enzymatically catalysed by kinases and phosphatases, respectively, and constitute the most important signalling mechanisms known in eukaryotic cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000201-Hunter1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. The phosphorylation state of a protein can determine its activity and, thereby, regulate the pathway(s) in which it is involved. Thus, the present study probed the potential role of key components of host hepatocyte signal transduction pathways, focusing on kinases as key regulators for a wide range of cellular functions.</p><fig id="ppat-1000201-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1000201.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>RNA interference screen strategy for identification of host factors affecting <italic>Plasmodium</italic> infection.</title><p>(A) Experimental design of a high-throughput RNAi screen to identify host genes that influence <italic>Plasmodium</italic> sporozoite infection of host cells.

The effect of each gene-specific knock-down on the infection of Huh7 cells by <italic>Plasmodium</italic> sporozoites was then monitored using the high-throughput, high-content immunofluorescence microscopy-based assay mentioned above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000201-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Briefly, short interfering RNA duplexes (siRNAs) targeting each of the chosen genes were transfected into Huh7 cells 24 h after seeding in 96-well plates. Forty-eight h later, cells were infected with <italic>P. berghei</italic> sporozoites. Cells were fixed 24 h after infection and immuno-stained to detect intracellular parasites (EEFs), as well as host cell nuclei and F-actin to estimate cell numbers and confluency, respectively. Following image acquisition, customized image analysis algorithms were used to automatically quantify infection rates, normalizing the number of EEFs against the cell confluency in each well. A plate-wise normalization was also used to facilitate comparisons between plates in the first pass of the screen, where the low rate of positive hits yields minimal expectation of variability in the mean infection values between different plates. To this end, the infection rate in each experimental well was calculated as a percentage of the mean infection rate from all experimental wells on that plate. In order to assess possible siRNA effects on cell proliferation, infection rate data were plotted against the number of nuclei, also expressed as a percentage of the mean number of nuclei for that plate.</p><p>The RNAi strategy employed was validated by targeting 53 randomly chosen genes with 3 siRNAs each and performing quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis to determine the level of knock-down achieved in each case. For 13 of these genes either expression was too low to be correctly assessed or primer specificity was insufficient. Most importantly, for 85&#x00025; of the genes whose expression could be determined, at least 1 of the siRNAs led to an expression knock-down greater than 70&#x00025; (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000201-g001">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p>Sporozoite infection assays inevitably have considerable levels of variation, a problem that cannot currently be overcome and which exacerbates difficulties generally associated with siRNA screens. In order to reduce the risk of reporting false positives, a multi step screening system was devised in which candidate genes were subjected to three screening passes with increasingly stringent selection criteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000201-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). In the first pass, the 727 selected genes were screened by targeting each with three distinct siRNAs used individually (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000201.s001">Table S1</xref>). In order to minimize the number of false negative results, candidate gene hits were selected for follow-up in pass 2 if any single one of the three siRNAs yielded an increase or decrease on infection greater than 2 standard deviations (s.d.) of the average of the infection of the whole data set, within a defined range of nuclei number (&#x000b1;40&#x00025; of the average number of nuclei in each experimental plate) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000201-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). The latter precaution, while relatively inclusive, allowed us to exclude from further analysis those siRNAs yielding strong effects on cell proliferation or survival.</p><fig id="ppat-1000201-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.ppat.1000201.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>A kinome-wide RNAi screen identifies host genes that influence <italic>P. berghei</italic> sporozoite infection of Huh7 cells.</title><p>(A) Schematic illustration of the three screening passes with increasing stringency criteria.

In this round of analysis, siRNAs were noted as &#x0201c;positive candidates&#x0201d; if they yielded infection rates more than 2 s.d. above or below the mean of all the negative controls in this pass. Negative controls replaced whole data set mean for s.d. calculation, since the selected subset of genes in this pass 2 was expected to have a significantly higher hit rate than in pass 1. To minimize the risk of false positives due to siRNA sequence-dependent off-target effects, the selection of candidate genes for follow-up beyond pass 2 required that at least two independent siRNAs targeting the same gene be &#x0201c;positive candidates&#x0201d; according to the above selection criteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000201-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). Furthermore, genes for which different siRNAs yielded conflicting phenotypic results were also excluded from further analysis. In order to further minimize any bias due to experimental variability, all pass 2 siRNAs were assayed in two independent experiments, and were selected for follow-up only if the criteria were met in both experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000201-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). It is worthwhile noting that while in Pass 1 only 3.6&#x00025; of the siRNAs met the selection threshold, 18.4&#x00025; of the siRNAs tested for the first time in Pass 2 met similar criteria, while the distribution of infection levels in controls is not statistically different between pass 1 and pass 2 experiments, showing that a 5-fold enrichment has taken place from Pass 1 to Pass 2.</p><p>The 16 genes thus selected for further verification in pass 3 were targeted with the siRNAs yielding the strongest phenotypes in the second pass. This third pass was used to further restrict our selection to those genes showing clearest functionality, i.e. those with at least two siRNAs yielding infection rates more than 3 s.d. above or below the mean of all the negative controls in the assay, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ppat-1000201-g002">Figure 2E</xref>). Secondly, target mRNA knock-down levels attained for these genes were also assessed in this pass by qRT-PCR. This allowed the selection of positive hit candidates to be refined further yet by excluding genes for which a correlation between phenotypic severity and decreased mRNA levels could not be confirmed

positive hits, showing RNAi-induced loss-of-function phenotypes with specific, reproducible and marked effects on <italic>P. berghei</italic> infection rates in our Huh7-based assay: MET, PKC&#x003b6; (PKCzeta), PRKWNK1, SGK2 and STK35. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000201.s002">Figure S1</xref>, knock-down of the expression of these genes did not lead to any significant effects in terms of cell proliferation or morphology (see also <xref ref-type="table" rid="ppat-1000201-t001">Table 1</xref>). It should also be noted that the present data do not rule out the possible involvement of other genes among those tested here, since negative results in RNAi screens are generally inconclusive <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000201-Echeverri1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>, and certain genes showing phenotypes with lower than 3 s.d. from mean levels in our assays may provide real, though perhaps more subtle, functionalities in this context. For this reason, the reader is referred to <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000201.s001">Table S1</xref> for a comprehensive list of siRNAs employed throughout the screen and their corresponding z scores (which measure the number of standard deviations away from the mean for the whole normalized data set), obtained throughout the screen.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Top screening hits classification</title><p>It may be noted that all five genes we identified as top hits encode protein kinases belonging to 3 different classes, according to the kinome classification <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000201-Manning1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>: &#x0201c;AGC&#x0201d;, &#x0201c;other&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;TK&#x0201d; (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000201.s003">Figure S2A</xref>). While it is tempting to draw conclusions from this, we would advise against it since, as aforementioned, the experimental methods and prioritization strategies used here cannot conclusively rule out the involvement of other tested genes which did not make the final selection. The range of cellular processes implicated by the genes identified as top hits in the present screen include cell cycle control, cytoskeleton regulation, osmotic balance and stress/immune responses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="ppat.1000201.s003">Figure S2B</xref>). This is consistent with the broad range of cellular functions similarly implicated by Agaisse <italic>et al.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000201-Agaisse1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref> in the infection of <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells by intracellular bacterial pathogens. However, when we performed an hypergeometric test to identify which Gene Ontology (GO) terms were significantly enriched in the analysis (<italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.05), not all categories were equally represented in passes 2 and 3 with a major proportion of genes involved in cytoskeleton regulation.

In the present study, loss of PKC&#x003b6; function both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, whether by RNAi silencing or by pseudo-substrate inhibition, led to decreased infection rates. This unequivocally establishes a key role of PKC&#x003b6; in host liver malarial infection, thereby, giving confidence that the other genes identified in the RNAi screen also play a relevant role during infection. Furthermore, as we gain additional understanding of the pathway defined by PKC&#x003b6; in this context, its potential biomedical value may develop not merely as one, but rather also as the founding member in an entirely novel class of anti-malarial drug target. In addition, our data reveals a role for PKC&#x003b6; signaling in host cell invasion by <italic>Plasmodium</italic> sporozoites. To our knowledge, this is the first host cell signaling molecule to be identified as an important player in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> invasion and paves the way to a better understanding of this essential host-<italic>Plasmodium</italic> interaction in the establishment of a malaria infection.</p><p>The interaction of a pathogen with its host cell activates intracellular signaling cascades that regulate innate immune responses and govern the outcome of infection (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ppat.1000201-Wang1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref> for a recent review on this topic).
