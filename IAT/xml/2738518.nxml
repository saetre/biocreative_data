We report that the WNV-capsid (Cp) by itself induces rapid nuclear condensation and cell death in tissue culture. Apoptosis is induced through the mitochondrial pathway resulting in caspase-9 activation and downstream caspase-3 activation. Capsid gene delivery into the striatum of mouse brain or interskeletal muscle resulted in cell death and inflammation, likely through capsid-induced apoptosis in vivo.

WNV, a single-stranded RNA virus, was initially isolated in the West Nile region of Uganda in 1937 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>) and has become prevalent in Africa, Asia, and Europe. Since its introduction into the United States in summer 1999, the sudden and rapid spread of this virus in the United States has caused much concern. WNV has been reported in infected mothers&#x02019; breast milk, and WNV transmission by organ transplantation and transfusion has been documented. Clearly, WNV infection is not only a regional public health problem, but a global health issue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R2">2</xref>). However, we lack a clear understanding of WNV pathogenesis, and little specific treatment exists for WNV infection. Therefore, a clearer understanding of WNV is necessary in order to identify new strategies to treat or prevent this viral infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R3">3</xref>).</p><p>Here we report on an unexpected role for WNV capsid (Cp) in viral-induced pathogenesis. We observed that the WNV-Cp protein is a pathogenic protein, which drives apoptosis in vitro through the mitochodrial/caspase-9 pathway. We also observed that expression of Cp protein in mouse muscle resulted in apoptosis and inflammation of muscle cells. More importantly, direct in vivo expression of WNV-Cp protein in mouse brain resulted in an induction of apoptosis similar to what is observed in natural infection. These results provide evidence of a link between WNV-Cp protein and WNV pathogenesis in vivo.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Cloning and Expression Analysis of WNV-Cp Gene</title><p>The cloning of a synthetic WNV-Cp gene based on the reported NY-99 infectious strain was described earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R4">4</xref>).

These apoptotic cells usually lost their polygonal shape as well as their contact with neighboring cells, and became round and stained exceptionally dark. Many of the apoptotic cells also exhibited clear vacuoles in the condensed cytoplasm. Fragmented, but equally condensed, apoptotic bodies were also present. Ultrastructurally, all of the apoptotic cells showed continuous plasma membranes, apparent aggregation of nuclear chromatin, highly condensed cytoplasm, and nearly intact organelles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1f</xref>).

These studies indicate that expression of Cp protein in mouse muscle resulted in apoptosis and inflammation of muscle cells in vivo. In this regard, induction of apoptosis and the resulting inflammatory cell infiltration induced by WNV-Cp expression may have an important role in viral pathogenesis.</p><fig id="F3" fig-type="figure" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>In vivo <italic>West Nile virus</italic> capsid (Cp) expression induces apoptosis and inflammation in mice.

As no component of WNV had been previously implicated in in vivo cell death of neuronal tissue, we reasoned that the WNV-Cp was a possible candidate, and we sought to investigate the effects of WNV-Cp in the brain in vivo. We directly injected DNA into the brain because that approach would not be complicated by vector delivery.</p><p>Mice were injected stereotactically with WNV-Cp or control plasmid DNA and euthanized 24&#x02013;48 h after injection. Sections were processed from the harvested brain samples as described in Materials and Methods. By using a monoclonal antibody specific to the His epitope contained in the plasmid vector, immunohistochemical analysis revealed that His-positive cells, as identified by HRP or fluorescein isothiocynate (FITC) were found in pcWNV-Cp-DJY&#x02013;injected mouse brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3f, h</xref>, respectively). Similar expression was absent in the brains of mice injected with control plasmid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3e, j</xref>, respectively). However, His-positive cells were detected in several areas of the cerebral cortex, including the motor cortex of the pcWNV-Cp-DJY injected mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3f</xref> by HRP, and 3h by FITC [arrows]). Nuclear condensation, a classic feature of apoptosis, was also observed in these sections by DAPI staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3i</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3m</xref>; arrows). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3g</xref> by HRP and 3l by FITC, we observed TUNEL-positive cells in the brain sections from the pcWNV-Cp-DJY&#x02013;injected mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3g</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3l</xref>) and not in the pcDNA3.1&#x02013;injected control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3n</xref>). These TUNEL-positive cells were localized to the specific sites of injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3l</xref>, arrow). These results illustrate that His-expressing cells were also TUNEL-positive, showing the direct relationship of WNV-Cp expression and in vivo apoptosis. WNV-Cp protein expression and apoptosis as well as inflammation were highly reproducible in all animals studied by injection with pcWNV-Cp-DJY plasmid. These data strongly suggest that the expression of the WNV-Cp protein in the central nervous system can play a role in neuronal cell death, and this process may be important in the pathogenesis of WNV-induced encephalitis.</p></sec><sec><title>Mitochondrial-Activated apoptotic Pathway</title><p>To characterize the apoptosis pathway activated by the WNV-Cp protein, we next examined its direct effects on the disruption of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential in these cells.

Furthermore, to examine whether the specific 3&#x02032;-terminal region is a determinant for the observed apoptosis, plasmids were transfected into RD cells, and cell lysates were analyzed for caspase-3, -8, and -9 activities. The native WNV-Cp constructs showed strong caspase-3 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5c</xref>). In addition, this 3&#x02032;-deletion mutant showed similarly lower induction of caspase-9 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5d</xref>). These data support the hypothesis that this 3&#x02032; domain plays an important role in the induction of apoptosis by the WNV-Cp protein. Furthermore, to confirm that this apoptosis-induction pathway is through caspase-9, a domant negative (DN) caspase-9 construct, which has been reported to inhibit the caspase cascade, was cotransfected wiwth pcWNV-Cp-DJY or pcWNV-CpWT and the expression level of pro-caspase-9 cleavage products (35&#x02013;37 kD) was compared to the activity of the 3&#x02032;-deletion mutant, pcWNV-Cp&#x00394;3&#x02032; and pcDNA3.1 in Western blot analysis. The DN caspase-9 specifically blocked the cleavage of pro-caspase-9 in pcWNV-Cp-DJY and pcWNV-CpWT cotransfected cell lysates compared to those of pcWNV-Cp-DJY or pcWNV-CpWT in transfected cell lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5e</xref>). Moreover, the cell lysate transfected with the 3&#x02032;-terminal deletion mutant had lower cleavage of pro-caspase-9, which is related to the lower induction of caspase-3 and &#x02013;9 activity as determined by protease activity assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">Figure 5c,d</xref>). Cell lysates from pcDNA3.1 control transfected cells show much less pro-caspase-9 cleavage products.</p><fig id="F5" fig-type="figure" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Apoptosis determining domain in WNV-Cp gene. a, Schematic diagram of pcWNV-Cp-DJY, pcWNV-CpWT, and pcWNV-Cp&#x02206;3&#x02032; constructs. b, Immunoprecipitation of in vitro translated protein from pcWNV-Cp-DJY (Cp-DJY), pcWNV-CpWT (CpWT), and pcWNV-Cp-3&#x02032; (Cp&#x02206;3&#x02032;) plasmids.

The Cp-induced apoptosis in the brain implies that the expression of the WNV-Cp protein in the central nervous system may play an important role in initiating neuronal cell death through apoptosis-induced inflammation. Therefore, this process may be important in the pathogenesis of WNV-induced encephalitis.</p><p>In this study, the WNV-Cp protein&#x02013;induced apoptosis through the destabilization of the mitochondrial transmembrane, resulting in the likely release of cytochrome c (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R21">21</xref>). The complex of cytochrome c/Apaf-1 recruits and activates procaspase-9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R22">22</xref>), not procaspase-8. Paradoxically, the karyophilicity of WNV-Cp protein does not fully explain the destabilization of the mitochondrial membrane and its ability to drive the caspase-9 apoptotic pathway. Therefore, it is possible that WNV-Cp changes the host cell transcriptional machinery, resulting in an over expression of certain proteins related to an apoptotic program, which consequently feed back to the mitochondria, or that as WNV-Cp moves from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, it may sequester or inactivate an important member of the antiapoptotic pathway or the cell cycle pathway, and thus induce the apoptotic cascade. Furthermore, the data suggest that WNV-Cp may interact with host cell proteins to induce apoptosis in the host cell. Identifying these proteins will likely give more insight into the biology of WNV. This biology likely involves the WNV-Cp 3&#x02032; region. Moreover, this flavivirus contains a capsid protein, which localizes to the nucleus. Flavivirus replication is normally cytoplasmic, although some evidence supports nuclear function as part of the viral life cycle. In fact, Kunjin virus capsid has been found in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R23">23</xref>). Our results identify the nuclear localizing property of the protein as a potential pathogenic attribute. Hence, the pathogenic region of the protein is localized within the 3&#x02032;-terminal region. Therefore, creating a WNV isolate that no longer localizes the capsid to the nucleus may result in a virus that loses pathogenesis, providing a novel approach for vaccine studies. These results also imply that inhibiting the C-terminal region&#x02019;s ability to interact with its putative ligand could be an important target for the development of new treatments for WNV infection.</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="citation"><p><italic>Suggested citation for this article:</italic> Yang J-S, Ramanathan MP, Muthumani K, Choo AY, Jin S-H, Yu Q-C, et al.
