Identified as an in vitro DNA-binding activity, NBP belongs to a family of nuclear-encoded chloroplast proteins which share a common domain structure and are thought to be involved in posttranscriptional regulation of chloroplast gene expression. NBP contains an N-terminal chloroplast transit peptide, a highly acidic domain and a pair of ribonucleoprotein consensus sequence domains. NBP is expressed in a light-dependent, organ-specific manner which is consistent with its involvement in chloroplast biogenesis. The relationship of NBP to the other members of this protein family and their possible regulatory functions are discussed.</p><sec><title>Images</title><fig id="F1"><graphic xlink:href="nar00076-0190-a" xlink:role="361"/></fig><fig id="F2"><graphic xlink:href="nar00076-0191-a" xlink:role="362"/></fig><fig id="F3"><graphic xlink:href="nar00076-0191-b" xlink:role="362"/></fig></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><supplementary-material content-type="scanned-pages"><graphic xlink:href="nar00076-0188.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="359"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00076-0189.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="360"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00076-0190.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="361"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00076-0191.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="362"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00076-0192.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="363"/><graphic xlink:href="nar00076-0193.tif" xlink:title="scanned-page" xlink:role="364"/></supplementary-material></body></article>
