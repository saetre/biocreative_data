Upon antigen recognition, naive CD4 T cells undergo a rapid clonal expansion, followed by the differentiation into functionally distinct Th cell subsets, such as effector Th1 and Th2 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>). These effector T cells undergo a dramatic contraction in numbers after antigen clearance, with 90&#x02013;95% succumbing to apoptosis within weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>). However, some of the effector T cells are maintained as memory T cells for long periods in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to CD8 memory T cells, CD4 memory T cells may not require the signals through common cytokine receptor &#x003b3; chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref>). However, critical regulatory roles of IL-7 in the generation and survival of memory CD4 T cells were reported recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>). In addition, the homeostasis of memory CD4 T cells is dependent on the signals through the TCR as well as the IL-7 receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>). Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 are reported to be the downstream targets of the IL-7 receptor and promote T cell survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>).</p><p>Several properties that distinguish memory T cells from naive T cells have been described, such as increased longevity and enhanced capacity for recall response to cognate antigen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>). Memory T cells have several features associated with stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>), and the similarity of the gene expression pattern between memory T/B cells and long-term hematopoietic stem cells was reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref>). Similar to hematopoietic stem cells, memory T cells appear to possess the ability to proliferate in response to homeostatic signals. The homeostatic signals may drive self-renewal, whereas antigenic signals drive effector cell differentiation and function.</p><p>The <italic>polycomb</italic> group (PcG) gene <italic>Bmi1</italic> has recently been implicated in the maintenance of hematopoietic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref>), neural (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">22</xref>), and cancer stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>). PcG gene products form multimeric complexes and maintain the early determined gene expression patterns of key developmental regulators, such as homeobox genes both in invertebrates and vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref>). Bmi1, Mel-18, M33, Pc2, Rae-28/Mph1, Mph2, and Ring1A/B are constituents of a multimeric protein complex similar to the <italic>polycomb</italic> repressive complex (PRC)1 identified in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Another PcG complex, which contains Eed, Suz12, Ezh1, and Ezh2, is PRC2. PRC2 possesses an intrinsic histone H3-K27 methyltransferase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>), which implicates a likely mechanism for PcG-mediated gene silencing. Lack of individual components of PRC1 results in apoptosis and the loss of proliferative responses of immature lymphoid cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref>). In mature lymphocytes, PcG gene products play several roles in differentiation and cell fate. Mel-18 controls Th2 cell differentiation through the regulation of GATA3 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>), and Bmi1 controls the stability of GTAT3 protein in developing Th2 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>). EzH2 is involved in B cell development and controls IgH V(D)J rearrangement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>).</p><p>We herein investigated the role of Bmi1 in the generation and maintenance of memory CD4<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> Th1/Th2 cells. In the absence of Bmi1, the generation of both Th1 and Th2 memory cells was impaired as a consequence of increased Noxa expression. Because our previous study indicated that the expression of Bmi1 is higher in Th2 cells than Th1 cells, we sought to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the Bmi1/Noxa-mediated regulation of memory T cell generation by focusing primarily on memory Th2 cells. Our results indicate that Bmi1 controls memory CD4 T cell survival and function through the direct repression of the <italic>Noxa</italic> gene.</p><sec><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>Generation of memory Th1/Th2 cells was impaired in the absence of Bmi1</title><p>In <italic>Bmi1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice, although a reduction of cell numbers in the lymphoid organs was seen, substantial numbers of CD4 and CD8 T cells developed with normal expression of developmental cell surface antigens (not depicted).

Under IL-4&#x02013;limiting conditions, Th2 cell differentiation was impaired significantly in the absence of Bmi1, and the Bmi1-mediated regulation of the stability of GATA3 protein was demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>).</p><p>To investigate the role of <italic>Bmi1</italic> in the generation and maintenance of memory Th1/Th2 cells, we used a &#x0201c;memory Th1/Th2 mouse&#x0201d; system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref>) in which OVA-specific &#x003b1;&#x003b2;TCR transgenic (Tg) CD4 T cells from <italic>Bmi1<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup></italic>, <italic>Bmi1</italic><sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup>, or <italic>Bmi1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice were stimulated with antigenic OVA peptide and wild-type antigen-presenting cells under Th2 or Th1 culture conditions in vitro for 6 d, and these effector Th cells were then adoptively transferred into syngeneic BALB/c <italic>nu/nu</italic> mice (memory Th1/Th2 mice). 5 wk after cell transfer, the numbers of donor-derived KJ1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> memory Th1/Th2 cells were assessed in various organs. As shown in <xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 A</xref>, a <italic>Bmi1</italic> gene dose-dependent affect on the numbers of memory Th2 cells was observed in all tissues tested (spleen, liver, lung, and PBMCs). It is worth noting that even heterozygous <italic>Bmi1</italic><sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> groups showed marked effects. Although the expression levels of IL-7R&#x003b1; and IL-2R&#x003b2; were slightly lower on <italic>Bmi1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> memory Th2 cells as compared with wild-type cells, other surface marker antigens were expressed normally (Fig. S1 B). Next, KJ1<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> effector Th1 cells were transferred into BALB/c <italic>nu/nu</italic> mice. The memory Th1 cell generation from <italic>Bmi1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> effector Th1 cells was also impaired in all tissues tested (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 B</xref>). The reduction in the <italic>Bmi<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> group was not obvious.

This locus codes for two proteins, p16<sup>ink4a</sup> and p19<sup>arf</sup> (Ink4a and Arf), through the use of alternative reading frames. Ink4a is a cyclin D&#x02013;dependent kinase inhibitor that promotes cell cycle arrest after Rb activation. Arf induces p53 activation and p53-mediated cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>). In the <italic>Bmi1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> effector Th2 cells, we confirmed the increased expression of the <italic>Ink4a/Arf</italic> gene after anti-TCR stimulation (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). An increased mRNA expression of both <italic>Ink4a</italic> and <italic>Arf</italic> was confirmed (not depicted).

Furthermore, the deletion of the p53 gene failed to rescue the <italic>Bmi1</italic><sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> memory Th2 cell numbers (Fig. S6, available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20072000/DC1">http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/full/jem.20072000/DC1</ext-link>). These results suggest that the Ink4/Arf and p53-dependent pathways are not key pathways responsible for the reduced memory Th2 cell generation in <italic>Bmi1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> memory mice. To identify any possible proapoptotic genes whose expression is regulated by Bmi1 but not regulated by the Ink4/Arf and p53-dependent pathways, the expression levels of these proapoptotic genes were assessed in the <italic>Bmi1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>/<italic>Ink4a<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic>/<italic>Arf<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> Th2 cells. Among these proapoptotic genes, the level of <italic>Noxa</italic> mRNA increased in <italic>Bmi1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> Th2 cells and remained high in <italic>Bmi1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>/<italic>Ink4a<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic>/<italic>Arf<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> background, whereas other targets such as <italic>Bax</italic>, <italic>Puma</italic>, <italic>Bim</italic>, <italic>Bad</italic>, <italic>Fas</italic>, and <italic>Fas ligand</italic> were at the normal expression levels (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D</xref>). Increased expression of <italic>Noxa</italic> mRNA was observed also in effector Th1, Tc1, and Tc2 cells in the absence of Bmi1 (Fig. S7).

The results thus far obtained suggest that Bmi1 controls the generation of both Th1 and Th2 memory cells accompanied with an increased expression of Noxa. Our previous study indicated that the expression of Bmi1 is higher in Th2 cells than Th1 cells, and Bmi1 controls the generation of Th2 cells more profoundly as compared with Th1 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>).

Noxa is known to regulate selectively the pro-survival activity of Mcl1 and A1/Bfl-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">42</xref>), and an important role of Mcl1 in the survival of lymphocytes was reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">43</xref>). The mRNA expression of antiapoptotic genes Mcl1, Bclx, and BclxL was not changed in <italic>Bmi1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> memory (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 B</xref>) and induced normally in effector Th2 cells by the IL-7 treatment (unpublished data). Enforced expression of Noxa in effector Th2 cells resulted in the decreased generation of memory Th2 cells (<xref rid="fig3" ref-type="fig">Fig. 3 B</xref>), suggesting that the overproduction of Noxa prevents memory Th2 cell generation even in the presence of normal abundance of antiapoptotic proteins. Thus, it is likely that Bmi1 attenuates Noxa-mediated inhibition of Mcl1 pro-survival activity and promotes memory T cell generation.</p><p>Noxa was originally identified as a downstream target of p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">44</xref>). Arf/Mdm2-mediated stabilization of p53 protein and the resulting mRNA expression of the p53 target genes were reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref>). Therefore, it was likely that the enhancement of cell death observed in <italic>Bmi1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> Th2 cells is p53 dependent. However, the deletion of the <italic>p53</italic> gene failed to rescue the decreased generation of memory Th2 cells in the absence of Bmi1 (Fig. S6). Thus, an increased apoptotic cell death observed in <italic>Bmi1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> memory Th2 cells appears to be p53 independent.</p><p>The Bmi1-mediated repression of the <italic>Ink4a/Arf</italic> gene observed in the hematopoietic and neural stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">46</xref>) appears to operate in Th2 cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, A and B</xref>). It is known that Arf induces p53 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref>), resulting in the induction of p53-dependent genes, including Puma and Bim. An important role of Puma and Bim in the cell death of activated T cells was reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">48</xref>), and the expression of these genes was up-regulated in <italic>Bmi1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> effector and memory Th2 cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2, A and B</xref>). However, <italic>Bmi1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>/<italic>Ink4a<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic>/<italic>Arf<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> Th2 cells, in which the levels of Puma and Bim expression were not increased (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 D</xref>), failed to generate normal numbers of memory Th2 cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 C</xref>). Although the expression of <italic>Puma</italic> and <italic>Bim</italic> mRNA was up-regulated, the levels were considerably low compared with Noxa in <italic>Bmi1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> effector Th2 cells (<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2 A</xref>). This might explain the predominant effect of Noxa in the cell death of <italic>Bmi1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> Th2 cells. However, the current experimental data do not allow us to make any conclusions to be drawn in regards to the relative contribution of each of the factors in the survival of CD4 T cells. Thus, although Puma and Bim may play a role in the survival of memory Th2 cells, Noxa appears to be a critical target for the Bmi1-mediated regulation of memory Th2 cell survival.</p><p>Semi-acute survival of transferred <italic>Bmi1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> effector Th2 cells was substantially impaired (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 D</xref> and Figs. S3&#x02013;S5). On the other hand, high numbers of apoptotic cells were detected in the spleen even 5 wk after effector <italic>Bmi1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> Th2 cell transfer (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 F</xref>). The extent of the defect in homeostatic proliferation was modest (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1 E</xref>). The low number of <italic>Bmi1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> memory CD4 T cells persisted for at least 2 mo (unpublished data). These results suggest that the long-term survival of memory Th2 cells is also dependent on the expression of Bmi1. Collectively, we conclude that Bmi1 controls both semi-acute survival of effector Th2 cells and long-term survival of memory Th2 cells.</p><p>The PRC2 was reported to possess an intrinsic histone H3-K27 methyltransferase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>). The PRC1, including Bmi1 and Ring1, was shown to possess an activity of histone H2A ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">49</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">51</xref>), whereas there has been no report indicating that the PRC1 possess an intrinsic histone H3-K27 methyltransferase activity. Accumulating evidence supports a sequential binding model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">52</xref>), in which PRC2-mediated H3-K27 methylation serves as a binding site for the recruitment of PRC1 complex through the specific recognition of the H3-K27 methyl mark by the chromo domain of the polycomb protein, such as M33 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">53</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">54</xref>). In our study, however, the levels of tri-methylation of histone H3-K27 were substantially decreased in <italic>Bmi1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> Th1 and Th2 cells (Fig. S10 and <xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4, D and E</xref>). In addition, the levels of binding of Suz12, a component of PRC2, at the <italic>Noxa</italic> gene locus were decreased in <italic>Bmi1</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> Th2 cells (<xref rid="fig4" ref-type="fig">Fig. 4 F</xref>). Thus, in Th2 cells, Bmi1 may play an important role for the recruitment of PRC2 and subsequent histone H3-K27 methylation at the Noxa gene locus. Alternatively, the Bmi1-containing PcG complex in Th2 cells may associate with a unique molecule possessing an intrinsic histone H3-K27 methyltransferase activity. In any event, tri-methylation of histone H3-K27 at the Noxa gene locus is strictly regulated by the expression of Bmi1.</p><p>The expression of Bmi1 is required for the DNA CpG methylation of the <italic>Noxa</italic> gene (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 A</xref>). The binding of Dnmt1 at the CpG island was Bmi1 dependent (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 B</xref> and Fig. S11). The treatment with a 5-Aza resulted in the dissociation of Bmi1, Ring1B, and Suz12 from the CpG island (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 D</xref>) and the up-regulation of Noxa mRNA (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5 C</xref> and Fig. S13 A). Increased expression of Noxa mRNA and reduced binding of Bmi1 were confirmed in Dnmt1 knockdown T cells (<xref rid="fig5" ref-type="fig">Fig. 5, E and F</xref>). Recently, the PcG complex was reported to be associated with DNA methyltransferases, including Dnmt1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">55</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">56</xref>). Thus, a DNA methyltransferase, such as Dnmt1, may play a critical role in the recruitment and the repressive function of the PcG complex at the <italic>Noxa</italic> gene.</p><p>In this study, we demonstrate that the generation and maintenance of memory Th1/Th2 cells (<xref rid="fig1" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>) and the memory Th2 cell&#x02013;dependent airway inflammation are controlled by the expression of Bmi1 (<xref rid="fig6" ref-type="fig">Figs. 6</xref> and <xref rid="fig7" ref-type="fig">7</xref>). Our preliminary experiments demonstrate that at least Mel-18, Mph1/Rae28, and M33 appear to be involved in the regulation of memory Th2 cell generation (unpublished data), suggesting that the survival of memory Th2 cells is regulated by an epigenetic mechanism involving the Bmi1-containing PcG complex. We have recently reported that Bmi1 stabilizes GATA3 protein through the direct interaction with GATA3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>). Mel-18 is involved in the induction of GATA3 expression in developing Th2 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>). Collectively, PcG gene products appear to control the development of effector and memory Th2 cells at multiple steps in a distinct manner and govern the Th2-type immune responses and inflammation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec disp-level="3"><title>Mice.</title><p>Bmi1-deficient mice were provided by M. van Lohuizen (The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, Netherlands) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref>). p16<sup>Ink4a</sup>/p19<sup>Arf</sup> double-deficient mice were provided by R.A.
