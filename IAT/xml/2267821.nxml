To study the mechanisms controlling the degradation of apoptotic cells, we developed time-lapse imaging protocols in developing <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> embryos and established the temporal order of multiple events during engulfment and phagosome maturation. These include sequential enrichment on phagocytic membranes of phagocytic receptor cell death abnormal 1 (CED-1), large GTPase dynamin (DYN-1), phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI(3)P), and the small GTPase RAB-7, as well as the incorporation of endosomes and lysosomes to phagosomes. Two parallel genetic pathways are known to control the engulfment of apoptotic cells in <named-content content-type="genus-species">C. elegans</named-content>. We found that null mutations in each pathway not only delay or block engulfment, but also delay the degradation of engulfed apoptotic cells. One of the pathways, composed of CED-1, the adaptor protein CED-6, and DYN-1, controls the rate of enrichment of PI(3)P and RAB-7 on phagosomal surfaces and the formation of phagolysosomes. We further identified an essential role of RAB-7 in promoting the recruitment and fusion of lysosomes to phagosomes. We propose that RAB-7 functions as a downstream effector of the CED-1 pathway to mediate phagolysosome formation. Our work suggests that phagocytic receptors, which were thought to act specifically in initiating engulfment, also control phagosome maturation through the sequential activation of multiple effectors such as dynamin, PI(3)P, and Rab GTPases.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>Cells undergoing programmed cell death, or apoptosis, within an animal are swiftly engulfed by phagocytes and degraded inside phagosomes, vesicles in which the apoptotic cell is bounded by the engulfing cell's membrane.

Our current knowledge of phagosome maturation, the process that results in the complete degradation of phagosomal contents, is primarily obtained through the studies of phagosomes containing opsonized foreign pathogens or undigestible latex beads. Early during phagosomal maturation, signaling molecules such as Rab5 and PI(3)P are observed to be enriched on nascent phagosomes and act to recruit multiple downstream factors &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060061-b005">5</xref>&#x0005d;. Early and late endosomes and lysosomes continue to fuse with phagosomes, and provide necessary lipids and proteins for phagosome maturation. Phagosome lumen is gradually acidified. The final state, known as a phagolysosome, is characterized by its abundance of acid hydrolases and an acidic pH environment &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060061-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060061-b006">6</xref>&#x0005d;. The maturation of phagosomes containing apoptotic cells, by contrast, is less characterized, and may display distinct mechanistic features. Macrophages that internalize foreign pathogens secrete proinflammatory cytokines that induce inflammatory responses, whereas those engulfing apoptotic cells secrete anti-inflammatory cytokines, indicating that the same type of phagocytes elicit different responses to different phagocytic targets &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060061-b002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060061-b007">7</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Rab GTPases are important regulators of many vesicle trafficking events.

Previous TEM analyses, which only characterized the terminal mutant phenotypes hours after the apoptosis events, were unable to determine whether the rest of cell corpses are engulfed, or to detect defects in the kinetics of engulfment and/or phagosome maturation.</p><p>Recently, we developed a time-lapse imaging protocol and used it to characterize the function of DYN-1 in developing embryos &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060061-b001">1</xref>&#x0005d;. We found that in engulfing cells, DYN-1 was recruited to the surface of phagocytic cups and phagosomes in a CED-1&#x02013;, CED-6&#x02013;, and CED-7&#x02013;dependent manner. DYN-1 promoted the recruitment and fusion of endosomes to phagocytic membranes, events that provide lipid and protein material to support pseudopod extension and phagosome maturation &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060061-b001">1</xref>&#x0005d;. These results suggest that the engulfment and degradation of apoptotic cells may share common regulatory mechanisms.

In many cases, the weak CTNS-1::GFP signal on phagosomal surfaces was unstable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060061-g009">Figure 9</xref>A).

However, DYN-1 remains on phagosomal surfaces for a longer period (18 min). CED-1 thus may establish an active state of phagosomal surfaces through the activation of DYN-1. The rapid accumulation of PI(3)P on the surfaces of nascent phagosomes is likely to reflect the local activation of a Class III PI(3) kinase &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060061-b020">20</xref>&#x0005d;, whose activity and/or localization on phagosomal surfaces may be controlled by the CED-1 pathway.</p><p>We thus propose that CED-1, CED-6, and DYN-1 act in a signaling pathway to control both the engulfment and the degradation of engulfed apoptotic cells, through regulating different downstream effectors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060061-g011">Figure 11</xref>B). On nascent phagosomes, or perhaps even before the phagocytic cup is enclosed, this pathway may actively prime the phagosomal membrane for the reception of multiple signaling molecules and sequential incorporation of intracellular vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060061-g011">Figure 11</xref>A).</p><p>Although extensive studies suggest that nascent phagosomes possess multiple signaling molecules on their surfaces, the identity of the ultimate initial signal that triggers phagosome maturation remains unclear. An activated phagocytic receptor may well be the source of this signal. When in complex with extracellular ligands, phagocytic receptors were known to undergo certain conformational changes that lead to the activation of their intracellular domains &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060061-b051">51</xref>&#x0005d;, which in turn may act on the cytoplasmic side of phagocytic cups and phagosomes to recruit cytosolic factors. Our report that CED-1 initiates phagosomal maturation through activating downstream effectors suggests that phagocytic receptors for apoptotic cells in different organisms, including mEGF10, the human CED-1 homolog &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060061-b052">52</xref>&#x0005d;, and perhaps even phagocytic receptors for foreign pathogens, may act to regulate the downstream phagosome maturation events. Furthermore, by activating different phagocytic receptors, phagocytic targets that are &#x0201c;self&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;foreign&#x0201d; might thus initiate differential phagosome maturation processes.</p></sec><sec id="s3e"><title>CED-5 Controls Phagosome Maturation through a Distinct Pathway</title><p><italic>ced-5</italic> null mutants are defective in the recruitment of lysosomes to phagosomes.
