The <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe fbh1 </italic>gene encodes an F-box DNA helicase previously described to play a role in the Rhp51 (an orthologue of <italic>S. cerevisiae RAD51</italic>)-dependent recombinational repair of DSBs.

Moreover, nuclear foci do not form in <italic>fbh1-fb </italic>cells with DNA damage even if Fbh1-fb is targeted to the nucleus by fusion to a nuclear localization signal sequence. In contrast, the helicase mutation <italic>fbh1-hl </italic>causes the accumulation of Fbh1 foci irrespective of the presence of DNA damage and confers damage sensitivity greater than that conferred by the null allele.

Extensive studies of HR repair mechanisms in the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae </italic>have shown that HR requires members of the <italic>RAD52 </italic>epistasis group, including <italic>RAD50</italic>, <italic>MRE11</italic>, <italic>XRS2</italic>, <italic>RAD51</italic>, <italic>RAD54</italic>, <italic>RAD55</italic>, <italic>RAD57</italic>, and <italic>RAD59 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. More recent studies of HR mechanisms in the fission yeast <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe </italic>have revealed many similarities with HR in <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>and have led to many insights into the mechanisms of HR-dependent DSB repair and the identification of novel genes with homologues in higher eukaryotes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. For example, Rhp51-interacting proteins such as the Swi5-Sfr1 mediator complex function in a separate pathway from Rhp55-Rhp57 to promote an Rhp51 strand exchange reaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Furthermore, the <italic>fbh1 </italic>gene encodes a protein consisting of a unique domain architecture, with N-terminal F-box and C-terminal DNA helicase domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], which is conserved in mammals but not in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. The Fbh1 protein was originally identified as a 3' to 5' DNA helicase that is stimulated by RPA at low ATP concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. The helicase domain of Fbh1 is structurally related to the Rep, UvrD, PcrA, and Srs2 family of helicases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Previous studies have shown that <italic>S. cerevisiae </italic>Srs2 regulates <italic>RAD52</italic>-dependent HR by actively disrupting the Rad51 nucleoprotein filament [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Interestingly, in contrast to Fbh1, Srs2 is conserved in budding and fission yeasts but not in mammals. In <italic>S. pombe</italic>, the <italic>fbh1</italic>&#x00394; mutation is lethal when combined with the <italic>srs2</italic>&#x00394; mutation, and this synthetic lethality can be suppressed by a loss of HR functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Recently, <italic>Chiolo et al</italic>. reported that human FBH1 (hFBH1) suppresses specific recombination defects of <italic>S. cerevisiae srs2 </italic>mutants and that the F-box domain is essential for hFBH1 functions in this respect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Thus, the Fbh1 and Srs2 helicases appear to have only partially analogous functions in controlling HR after the formation of Rhp51 nucleoprotein filaments.</p><p>F-box proteins were first characterized as components of SCF ubiquitin-ligase complexes containing Skp1, Cullin, and F-box proteins, in which they bind substrates for ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The F-box motif consists of 40&#x02013;50 amino acids and is required for binding to SKP1. Therefore, the F-box motif links F-box proteins to other components of the SCF complex. Indeed, hFBH1 was shown to form an SCF complex and to have ubiquitin ligase activity <italic>in vitro </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. However, the physiological substrates of SCF<sup>Fbh1 </sup>are still unknown.</p><p>In this study, we characterize the <italic>in vivo </italic>function of Fbh1, focusing on the role of its F-box and helicase domains. Our results demonstrate that the F-box domain of Fbh1 is required for its recruitment to the nucleus and to DNA damage sites, whereas the helicase domain is involved in DNA processing after the Rhp51-dependent step of HR. Thus, both domains have indispensable but distinct roles in Fbh1 functions, and assembly of the SCF<sup>Fbh1 </sup>complex is a prerequisite for its DNA recombination activities.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and Discussion</title><sec><title>Construction of <italic>fbh1 </italic>mutants with substitutions in the F-box or helicase motif</title><p>Fbh1 has a highly conserved N-terminal F-box motif and seven C-terminal helicase motifs. To gain insights into the roles of the F-box and helicase motifs in DNA repair, we constructed two <italic>fbh1 </italic>mutants, <italic>fbh1-fb </italic>and <italic>fbh1-hl</italic>, in which alanine replaces the Pro<sup>15 </sup>and Leu<sup>26 </sup>residues within the F-box motif and the Lys<sup>301 </sup>residue within the Walker A motif of the helicase domain, respectively (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1A</xref>). The highly conserved Pro<sup>15 </sup>and Leu<sup>26 </sup>residues in the F-box motif are essential for binding to Skp1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], and Lys<sup>301 </sup>is a conserved catalytic residue in the Walker A motif essential for ATPase activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. To determine whether the <italic>fbh1-fb </italic>mutant is defective in binding to Skp1, we performed a co-immunoprecipitation assay using HA-tagged Skp1 and GFP-tagged versions of Fbh1. GFP-fused <italic>fbh1</italic>, <italic>fbh1-fb</italic>, <italic>fbh1-hl</italic>, or <italic>fbh1-fb/hl </italic>alleles were integrated into the genome at the <italic>ars1 </italic>locus in an <italic>fbh1</italic>&#x00394; strain and expressed under the control of the <italic>nmt1 </italic>promoter. GFP-Fbh1 complemented the repair deficiency of the <italic>fbh1 </italic>deletion strain (data not shown) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], indicating that GFP-Fbh1 and Fbh1 function similarly <italic>in vivo</italic>. We found that wild type Fbh1 and Fbh1-hl, but not Fbh1-fb, co-immunoprecipitated with HA-tagged Skp1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>), indicating that the <italic>fbh1-fb </italic>mutation prevents association with SCF components.</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Construction of <italic>fbh1 </italic>mutants with substitutions in the F-box or helicase motif</bold>.

To examine the effect of the <italic>fbh1 </italic>mutations on these phenotypes, they were introduced into the <italic>S. pombe </italic>genome at the endogenous <italic>fbh1 </italic>locus. The <italic>fbh1-fb </italic>mutation conferred methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) and bleomycin sensitivities similar to those of the <italic>fbh1</italic>&#x00394; mutant, and it suppressed the poor growth phenotype of the <italic>rad22</italic>&#x00394; strain to a similar extent as the <italic>fbh1</italic>&#x00394; mutation (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). Thus, the <italic>fbh1-fb </italic>mutant is defective in binding to Skp1, and the <italic>fbh1-fb </italic>mutation behaves like the <italic>fbh1</italic>&#x00394; mutation with respect to DNA damage sensitivity and the suppression of the poor growth of <italic>rad22</italic>&#x00394; cells. These results are consistent with a recent study showing that hFBH1 suppresses the hypersensitivity of <italic>S. cerevisiae srs2</italic>&#x00394; cells to DNA damaging agents and that the F-box domain of hFBH1 is essential for this effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. In another study, Osman et al. showed that the F-box domain plays a minor role in Fbh1 function because an F-box mutant (L14A/P15A) created in a previous study has no or little sensitivity to DNA damaging agents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. This discrepancy may arise from the use of different F-box mutants. Our F-box mutant (P15A/L26A) is completely defective in binding to Skp1, while in the previous study, the <italic>fbh1 </italic>L14A/P15A mutant had not been characterized in this regard. We suppose that the <italic>fbh1 </italic>L14A/P15A mutation may not fully inactivate the F-box, as previously discussed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>].</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>F-box and helicase mutants are deficient in DNA damage repair</bold>.

The <italic>fbh1-hl </italic>mutant shows greater sensitivity to DNA damaging agents than does the <italic>fbh1</italic>&#x00394; mutant (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). In addition, ectopic expression of the <italic>fbh1-hl </italic>allele renders wild type cells sensitive to MMS, suggesting that the <italic>fbh1-hl </italic>alteration is a dominant mutation (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>). Previous studies suggest that Fbh1 promotes HR repair by controlling the action of Rhp51 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], which contributes to the suppression of inappropriate recombination events. Therefore, one possibility to explain the <italic>fbh1-hl</italic>-dependent toxic phenotype is that toxic recombination intermediates caused by faulty Rhp51-dependent HR accumulate to a greater extent in the <italic>fbh1-hl </italic>mutant than in the <italic>fbh1</italic>&#x00394; mutant. To test this possibility, we examined the MMS sensitivity of the <italic>fbh1-hl </italic>strain in an <italic>rhp51</italic>&#x00394; background. As expected, <italic>fbh1-hl </italic>cells were as sensitive to MMS as <italic>fbh1</italic>&#x00394; cells with the <italic>rhp51</italic>&#x00394; background (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2C</xref>). These results indicate that Fbh1-hl is not only defective in Fbh1 function but also that it interferes with Rhp51-dependent HR. In addition, the <italic>fbh1-hl </italic>mutation does not suppress the poor growth of <italic>rad22</italic>&#x00394; cells, but rather, it exacerbates their decreased growth rate (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). However, the <italic>fbh1-fb/hl </italic>mutant, which has alterations within both the F-box and Walker A motifs, is as sensitive to DNA damaging agents as the <italic>fbh1-fb </italic>or <italic>fbh1</italic>&#x00394; strains (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>), and mutations affecting both domains suppress the slow growth phenotype of the <italic>rad22</italic>&#x00394; strain (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>), suggesting that F-box activity is likely to be a prerequisite for helicase activity. Thus, the F-box and DNA helicase domains play indispensable but distinct roles in Fbh1 function.</p></sec><sec><title>Focus formation of <italic>fbh1 </italic>mutants in response to DNA damage</title><p>Since GFP-Fbh1 is predominantly detected in the nucleus and forms foci in response to DNA damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], we assessed DNA damage-induced focus formation in the <italic>fbh1 </italic>mutants. Exponentially growing cells were incubated in EMM2 medium containing 0.1% MMS in the absence of thiamine for 2 h, and GFP-Fbh1 was localized by fluorescence microscopy. The levels of expression of the GFP-fused wild type Fbh1 and of the three mutant Fbh1 proteins were comparable (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3A</xref>). Five percent of untreated cells expressing wild type GFP-Fbh1 contained foci, and 47% of these cells contained foci following MMS treatment (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). Interestingly, no foci were visible in cells expressing GFP-Fbh1-fb, even after exposure to MMS (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>), indicating that the F-box domain is required for Fbh1 focus formation. In contrast, 27% of untreated cells expressing GFP-Fbh1-hl had foci, and this percentage was dramatically larger than that of cells expressing wild type GFP-Fbh1 (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). Following MMS treatment, the proportion of cells with foci further increased to 78% (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). One possible explanation for the increased focus formation of <italic>fbh1-hl </italic>cells is that Fbh1-hl can localize to DNA damage sites but not complete DNA processing because it lacks helicase activity, leading to its accumulation at these sites and interference with the HR pathway. Moreover, the additional presence of the F-box mutation almost abolished focus formation in Fbh1-hl cells irrespective of the presence of DNA damage (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3C</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that the F-box domain is required for the recruitment of Fbh1 to DNA damage sites and that the helicase domain is required to mediate the HR process.</p><fig position="float" id="F3"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p><bold>DNA damage-induced focus formation of Fbh1 mutant proteins</bold>.

Although this interpretation could explain why the <italic>fbh1-fb </italic>mutation confers an <italic>fbh1 </italic>null phenotype and suppresses the toxic phenotypes of the <italic>fbh1-hl </italic>mutation, it is still unknown whether SCF<sup>Fbh1 </sup>complex formation is required for DNA damage-induced nuclear focus formation. To test this possibility, a NLS sequence from the simian virus 40 large-T antigen (PKKKRKV) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] was fused to the GFP-Fbh1 and GFP-Fbh1-fb constructs at their N termini, and focus formation in response to DNA damage was examined. As with GFP-Fbh1 cells, these constructs were integrated into the genome at the <italic>ars1 </italic>locus in the <italic>fbh1</italic>&#x00394; strain. Control experiments showed that NLS-GFP-Fbh1 but not NLS-GFP-Fbh1-fb complemented the MMS sensitivity of the <italic>fbh1</italic>&#x00394; strain (data not shown). As expected, NLS-GFP-Fbh1 formed discrete foci in cells exposed to MMS (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). NLS-GFP-Fbh1-fb was also detected in the nucleus like wild type Fbh1, but it still failed to form foci in response to DNA damage (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5</xref>). These results suggest that the F-box domain is required for the nuclear localization and DNA damage-induced focus formation of Fbh1. It should be noted that the GFP-F-box domain mutant could not enter the nucleus (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>), suggesting that in addition to the F-box domain, another domain of Fbh1 might also be important for its nuclear targeting.</p><fig position="float" id="F5"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p><bold>The F-box motif is required for DNA damage-induced focus formation of Fbh1</bold>. (A) <italic>fbh1</italic>&#x00394; cells expressing NLS-GFP-Fbh1 (wild type) and NLS-GFP-Fbh1-fb were treated as in Figure 3 with MMS (0.1%) for 2 h at 30&#x000b0;C and observed by fluorescence microscopy.

A recent study has shown that hFBH1 has a short half-life when it is expressed in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, and its degradation depends on the presence of a functional F-box and yeast SCF components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], suggesting that one candidate for a SCF<sup>hFBH1 </sup>substrate is hFBH1 itself. The rapid turnover of hFBH1 might contribute to the tight regulation of hFBH1 helicase activity. However, if SCF<sup>hFBH1 </sup>complex formation is also necessary for its nuclear transport and recruitment to DNA damage sites, the alteration in subcellular localization caused by the F-box mutation might affect hFBH1 stability in budding yeast cells. In addition, many F-box proteins identified to date target more than one substrate for degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Since our present data suggest that Fbh1 functions as an SCF<sup>Fbh1 </sup>ubiquitin ligase complex for HR repair, the most plausible candidates as SCF<sup>Fbh1 </sup>substrates are HR proteins, including Rhp51. For example, SCF<sup>Fbh1 </sup>might contribute to regulate Rhp51-dependent HR by promoting the ubiquitination of Rhp51 or other recombination proteins. Future studies will be needed to determine whether Fbh1 is a physiological SCF<sup>Fbh1 </sup>substrate and to identify other SCF<sup>Fbh1 </sup>substrates, which would provide a means to conduct a more detailed analysis of its function in HR repair.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this study, we characterized the <italic>in vivo </italic>function of Fbh1, focusing on the role of its F-box and helicase domains. Our results show that the assembly of SCF<sup>Fbh1 </sup>mediated by the F-box domain of Fbh1 is required for its recruitment to both the nucleus and DNA damage sites, whereas the helicase domain is involved in controlling the action of Rhp51. Thus, Fbh1 is tightly regulated by SCF components, which might prevent it from functioning inappropriately in HR.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title><italic>S. pombe </italic>strains and plasmids</title><p>All yeast strains used in this study are listed in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>. <italic>S. pombe </italic>cells were grown in YES or EMM medium, and standard genetic and molecular procedures were employed as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].
