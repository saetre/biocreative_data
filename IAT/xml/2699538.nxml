Tissue repair in humans, however, is limited compared to the regenerative capabilities of other vertebrates, such as the zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>). An understanding of stem cell mechanisms, such as how they are established, their self-renewal properties, and their recruitment to produce new cells is therefore important for the application of regenerative medicine. We use larval melanocyte regeneration following treatment with the melanocytotoxic drug MoTP to investigate these mechanisms in Melanocyte Stem Cell (MSC) regulation. In this paper, we show that the receptor tyrosine kinase, erbb3b, is required for establishing the adult MSC responsible for regenerating the larval melanocyte population. Both the erbb3b mutant and wild-type fish treated with the ErbB inhibitor, AG1478, develop normal embryonic melanocytes but fail to regenerate melanocytes after MoTP-induced melanocyte ablation. By administering AG1478 at different time points, we show that ErbB signaling is only required for regeneration prior to MoTP treatment and before 48 hours of development, consistent with a role in establishing MSCs. We then show that overexpression of kitla, the Kit ligand, in transgenic larvae leads to recruitment of MSCs, resulting in overproliferation of melanocytes. Furthermore, kitla overexpression can rescue AG1478-blocked regeneration, suggesting that ErbB signaling is required to promote the progression and specification of the MSC from a pre&#x02013;MSC state. This study provides evidence that ErbB signaling is required for the establishment of adult MSCs during embryonic development. That this requirement is not shared with the embryonic melanocytes suggests that embryonic melanocytes develop directly, without proceeding through the ErbB-dependent MSC. Moreover, the shared requirement of larval melanocyte regeneration and metamorphic melanocytes that develops at the larval-to-adult transition suggests that these post-embryonic melanocytes develop from the same adult MSC population. Lastly, that <italic>kitla</italic> overexpression can recruit the MSC to develop excess melanocytes raises the possibility that Kit signaling may be involved in MSC recruitment during regeneration.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>The promise of regenerative medicine lies in the ability to find or create stem cells that can be manipulated to replace damaged tissues and organs. Such ability requires an understanding of how adult stem cells are established and then later recruited to regenerate different tissues. Here, we study the zebrafish's ability to regenerate melanocytes, a pigment cell shared with humans, to understand these mechanisms. We show that the <italic>erbb3b</italic> gene is required to establish melanocyte stem cells in the embryo that are responsible for regenerating melanocytes after melanocytes are ablated in the larval zebrafish. Because this adult stem cell is not required for the development of embryonic melanocytes, we conclude that adult melanocyte stem cells develop in parallel to the embryonic tissues that they regulate. We also show that overexpressing <italic>kit ligand a</italic> will result in over-recruiting these adult stem cells to produce excess melanocytes. Further exploration into the mechanisms by which the zebrafish melanocyte stem cells are maintained and recruited will inform how adult stem cells might be manipulated for medical applications.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>As with other teleosts, the zebrafish has a remarkable ability to regenerate a wide range of tissues and organs including fins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000544-Johnson1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, heart <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000544-Poss1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, and retina <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000544-Bernardos1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000544-Fimbel1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. Epimorphic regeneration, involving the cell division and differentiation of undifferentiated post-embryonic precursors, or adult stem cells, has been proposed for each of these cases. Epimorphic regeneration requires several distinct events for the function of the adult stem cell: establishment, self-renewal, recruitment, and differentiation. In order to understand regeneration and its practical application in medicine, it is important to understand the molecular processes underlying each of these events <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000544-OReillyPol1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Very little is known about what developmental mechanisms are required for establishing adult stem cells. Furthermore, the relationship between adult stem cells and the primary cells or tissue they regulate is not yet clearly understood. It is unknown, for instance, whether adult stem cells contribute to embryonic growth and then remain quiescent until later recruitment, or if they are established by developmental mechanisms that are distinct from embryonic precursors.</p><p>The zebrafish embryonic pigment pattern is an excellent genetic model for investigating developmental processes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000544-Kelsh1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>. Of the neural crest derived pigmented cells, the melanocyte is of particular interest as it is common to both zebrafish and human, and several genetic pathways are conserved between the two <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000544-Dutton1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000544-Parichy1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. The embryonic melanocyte lineage arises from the neural crest beginning at 14 hours post fertilization (hpf). The melanocyte precursors, or melanoblasts, are not yet pigmented and migrate to the periphery where they differentiate and begin to melanize by 24 hpf. Most of the embryonic population of melanocytes is established by 3 dpf comprised of approximately 460 melanocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000544-Parichy1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. Except for approximately 20 additional melanocytes that develop from 3&#x02013;8 dpf at the horizontal myoseptum <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000544-Milos1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, melanocyte number remains static, with little to no turnover, until the adult pigment pattern is formed during metamorphosis at &#x0223c;14 dpf <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000544-Johnson2">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>We have developed a model for cell-specific regeneration of melanocytes during the period of stasis between 3 and 14 dpf <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000544-Yang1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. The melanocytotoxic chemical 4-(4-morpholinobutylthio)phenol (MoTP) is converted into a cytotoxin by the melanin synthesis enzyme tyrosinase. Accordingly, MoTP specifically ablates cells that express tyrosinase at high levels, which in the embryo are limited to melanoblasts and newly formed melanocytes. Typically MoTP is applied for 2 days to completely ablate the embryonic melanocyte lineage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000544-Yang1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. BrdU incorporation studies in regenerated melanocytes indicate that stem cells begin to divide to replace dying melanocytes within 24 hours of MoTP exposure. Regeneration is complete within 3&#x02013;4 days after MoTP washout, eventually replacing melanocytes in all parts of the larvae except the ventral-most yolk stripe. This procedure has allowed us to identify roles for previously identified genes, such as the receptor tyrosine kinase <italic>kit</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000544-Yang1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref> in the development of melanocytes from the melanocyte stem cell (MSC), as well as genes with regeneration-specific functions that act at early and late stages of melanocyte regeneration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000544-Yang2">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>. <italic>kit</italic> acts cell autonomously in the melanocyte lineage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000544-Parichy1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>, responding to its ligand (<italic>kitla</italic> in zebrafish) expressed in the skin or in cells adjacent to the notochord <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000544-Hultman1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref> to promote migration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000544-Parichy1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000544-Hultman1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000544-Rawls1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, survival <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000544-Parichy1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000544-Hultman1">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000544-Rawls1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000544-Mellgren1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref> and possibly cell division at different stages of the melanocyte lineage.

It is not yet known whether this requirement for <italic>kit</italic> is in the MSC itself, to promote recruitment of these quiescent stem cells, or for subsequent differentiation of regeneration melanoblasts, or both.</p><p>Genes identified by mutant phenotypes expressed during metamorphosis of the embryonic or early larval pigment pattern to the adult pigment pattern may also be involved in processes of adult stem cell regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000544-Parichy2">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000544-Budi1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. Metamorphosis mutants <italic>puma</italic> and <italic>picasso</italic> each show deficits in forming new melanocytes at the onset of metamorphosis. The positional cloning of <italic>picasso</italic> revealed that it was caused by a mutation in <italic>erbb3b</italic>, an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-like tyrosine kinase. Furthermore, drug inhibitors of the ErbB family of receptors, such as AG1478, administered to WT larvae as early as 14&#x02013;22 hpf phenocopied the <italic>picasso</italic> metamorphic defect. This finding strongly suggested a role for ErbB signaling during early embryonic development in establishing the stem cells involved in adult melanocyte development. An attractive possibility is that ErbB-dependent stem cells responsible for metamorphosis are also responsible for surveilling and regulating the larval melanocyte population.</p><p>In this study, we explore the role of ErbB signaling in establishing MSC populations that are drawn on for larval melanocyte regeneration. We show that both the <italic>picasso</italic> mutation and the ErbB inhibitor, AG1478, abolish melanocyte regeneration following embryonic melanocyte ablation by MoTP. Our results indicate a requirement of ErbB activity concurrent with embryonic melanocyte development and prior to melanocyte ablation by MoTP, suggesting that ErbB signaling is required during the establishment of larval MSCs. That both larval regeneration and metamorphosis require early ErbB signaling raises the possibility that the same stem cell population is involved in both larval regeneration and metamorphosis.</p><p>Furthermore, the finding that <italic>picasso</italic> or ErbB inhibitor treated embryos have normal embryonic pigment pattern but lack functional stem cells involved in regeneration or metamorphosis indicates there are two types of melanocytes: secondary larval regeneration melanocytes that develop from an ErbB-dependent stem cell, and primary ontogenetic, or embryonic, melanocytes that develop independent of ErbB function.</p><p>We also examined how AG1478 affects the establishment of MSCs. We took advantage of a transgenic line with constitutive overexpression of the <italic>kit ligand a</italic>, <italic>Tg(cmv:kitla)</italic>, which causes an increase in the number of ontogenetic melanocytes. We investigated which melanocyte lineage is responsible for increased melanocytes by examining the effects of drugs that specifically affect the stem-cell derived melanocytes. Thus, we show that the drug ICI-118,551, which specifically blocks regeneration melanocyte development at the <italic>dct&#x0002b;</italic> melanoblast stage but has no effect on the development of embryonic or ontogenetic melanocytes, ablates the <italic>kitla</italic>-mediated melanocyte increase in <italic>Tg(cmv:kitla)</italic> larvae. Moreover, AG1478, that blocks the establishment of functional MSCs, when given to <italic>Tg(cmv:kitla)</italic> larvae results in an additional increase in ectopic melanocytes. This additional increase is also blocked by the regeneration specific drug, ICI-118,551. That both regeneration-specific drugs have an effect on the number of ectopic melanocytes in <italic>Tg(cmv:kitla)</italic> larvae is evidence that overexpression of <italic>kitla</italic> is acting through the MSC lineage to produce excess melanocytes. That AG1478 does not reduce the number of excess melanocytes in <italic>Tg(cmv:kitla)</italic> larvea suggests that AG1478 arrests the stem cell lineage in a pre-stem cell stage (pre-MSC) and that these pre-MSC cells can be activated by <italic>kitla</italic> overexpression.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>ErbB Signaling Is Required for Larval Melanocyte Regeneration, But Not Ontogeny</title><p>We were interested in testing whether ErbB signaling is required for larval melanocyte regeneration and ontogeny.

Both ErbB inhibitors resulted in a deficit in the number of regenerated melanocytes but not ontogenetic melanocytes. Untreated larvae develop approximately 129.1&#x000b1;25.1 (mean&#x000b1;standard deviation) dorsal stripe melanocytes by 7 dpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000544-g001">Figure 1C</xref>), and following MoTP melanocyte ablation, regenerate 91&#x00025; (117.5&#x000b1;24.0 melanocytes) of their ontogenetic number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000544-g001">Figure 1D</xref>).

As was previously reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000544-Budi1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, <italic>erbb3b</italic> mutants have no deficit in embryonic melanocyte ontogeny (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000544-g001">Figure 1G</xref>). <italic>erbb3b</italic> animals have 125.4&#x000b1;13.7 dorsal and lateral melanocytes in the trunk, which is not significantly different from wild type (P&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.6). Following melanocyte ablation with MoTP, <italic>erbb3b</italic> larvae also showed a defect in regeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000544-g001">Figure 1H</xref>), regenerating approximately 33.2&#x000b1;11.3 melanocytes, significantly less than wild-type regeneration (P&#x0003c;0.0001).</p><p>In both AG1478-treated larvae and <italic>erbb3b</italic> mutants some regeneration was observed on the head and sporadically in parts of the trunk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000544-g001">Figure 1F and 1H</xref>, black bars). The largest deficit in regeneration was observed in the trunk in dorsal stripe (red bars) and lateral stripe melanocytes. Curiously, the regeneration deficit was more severe in inhibitor treated larvae than in <italic>erbb3b</italic> mutant larvae. One possible explanation for this small increase in residual number of regeneration melanocytes in the <italic>erbb3b</italic> mutants (33.2&#x000b1;11.3 melanocytes) compared to those that regenerate in WT larvae (12.4&#x000b1;7.8 melanocytes) is that partial suppressors of the regeneration defect have accumulated in the mutant stocks, that act equally on the mutant and the pharmacological inhibitor. Whatever is the cause of these increased residual melanocytes, the finding that the deficit in regeneration is not increased by combining the mutant and the pharmacological inhibitor (42&#x000b1;18.5 melanocytes, P&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;0.2) is consistent both with reports that AG1478 is highly specific to the ErbB family of receptor tyrosine kinases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000544-Levitzki1">&#x0005b;25&#x0005d;</xref> and with several reports that AG1478 blocks <italic>erbb2</italic>- and <italic>erbb3b</italic>-dependent signaling in zebrafish <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000544-Budi1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000544-Lyons1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000544-Honjo1">&#x0005b;26&#x0005d;</xref>. That the inhibitor-treated mutants have no additional deficit in regeneration melanocytes than either single perturbation argues that any possible additional actions of the drug on other ErbB class receptors or other kinases have no strong effects on the establishment of the melanocyte stem cell.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>ErbB Is Required for Larval Melanocyte Stem Cell (MSC) Establishment, But Not in Recruitment or Differentiation</title><p>The early requirement for ErbB activity in promoting metamorphosis suggested that it was required to establish a population of precursors for adult melanocytes.

It therefore remained possible that the effect of AG1478 in these experiments was to block recruitment of the MSC into developmental pathways following MoTP-induced ablation, rather than preventing the establishment of the MSC. To rule out this possibility, we delayed application of MoTP until 48 hours, after AG1478 was washed out. Like earlier MoTP exposure, melanoblasts and melanocytes are ablated by exposure to MoTP between 48 and 96 hours. Following washout of the MoTP, few new melanocytes regenerated (4.0&#x000b1;1.5 dorsal trunk melanocytes, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000544-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). This result argues that AG1478 is acting during stem cell establishment stage to deplete the melanocyte stem cells and prior to any relief of repression and subsequent recruitment that follows from the delayed ablation of embryonic melanoblasts and melanocytes.</p><p>Although the above experiment positively demonstrates the effect of AG1478 on blocking MSC establishment, it does not exclude an additional effect of AG1478 on preventing recruitment of the MSC following melanocyte ablation. To rule out such a role, we performed a reciprocal experiment, where MoTP was applied first, from 24&#x02013;72 hpf, followed by AG1478 treatment from 72 to 144 hpf. In these larvae, melanocytes regenerated in identical numbers to control larvae that were only treated with MoTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000544-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). This result indicates that AG1478 has no effect on the recruitment of the melanocyte stem cell to re-enter developmental pathways when the repressive effects of melanocytes and melanoblasts are relieved.</p><p>The preceding analyses, which show that AG1478 acts on the MSC before embryonic melanocytes and melanoblasts are ablated, argue that ErbB signaling acts to promote the establishment of the melanocyte stem cell population rather than on recruitment or differentiation of melanocytes from the stem cell population during larval melanocyte regeneration. This conclusion is consistent with previous studies that showed that AG1478 treatment during early embryonic stages was sufficient to block melanocyte development during pigment pattern metamorphosis nearly two weeks later <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000544-Budi1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>.

This property suggests that the melanocyte stem cell that supports larval melanocyte regeneration is not exhausted by making new melanocytes, but rather replaces itself, or self-renews, each time it is recruited to divide and make new melanocytes. We reasoned that these self-renewing divisions may have properties similar to the mechanisms that establish the stem cell during embryonic stages, and thus, might also require ErbB signaling.

Moreover, we reasoned that post-establishment application of a drug that blocked self-renewal would allow for a first round of melanocyte regeneration, but show deficits in subsequent rounds of regeneration. Accordingly, we developed a double regeneration assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000544-g004">Figure 4A</xref>), by which melanocytes are first simultaneously treated between 48 and 96 hpf with MoTP (to ablate melanoblasts and melanocytes) and AG1478, to potentially prevent self-renewal during this period.

This is easily observed by its effects on contracting the melanosomes in the melanocyte. It is unlikely that ICI-118,551's effects on regeneration are mediated through &#x003b2;2-adrenergic receptors, as other &#x003b2;2-adrenergic receptor antagonists, which are effective in contracting melanosomes in fish, have no effect on regeneration (not shown). Additionally, treating embryos together with ICI-118,551 and Forskolin, which should result in elevated cAMP levels and blocks the effect of ICI-118,551 on melanocyte contraction, fails to block the effect of ICI-118,551 on melanocyte regeneration.

This time period of AG1478 treatment prevented melanocyte regeneration in the trunk but not the tail of larvae (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000544-g003">Figure 3</xref>), providing an internal comparison between regions with affected and less affected stem cells in the larvae. As noted earlier, wild type larvae treated with AG1478 show no difference in the number of melanocytes that develop in either the trunk or the tail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000544-g007">Figure 7C</xref>). Untreated <italic>Tg(cmv:kitla)</italic> larva show an increase in the number of melanocytes in both the trunk (64.8&#x000b1;9.4 dorsal melanocytes, or 171&#x00025; of wild type, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000544-g007">Figure 7C</xref>) and the tail (47.9&#x000b1;12.2 dorsal melanocytes, or 168&#x00025; of wild type, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000544-g007">Figure 7C</xref>). When <italic>Tg(cmv:kitla)</italic> larva are treated with AG1478, they show an additional increase of 52&#x00025; in the number of melanocytes in the trunk (98.2&#x000b1;18.6 dorsal melanocytes, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000544-g007">Figure 7C</xref>) compared with untreated <italic>Tg(cmv:kitla)</italic> (P&#x0003c;0.0001). In contrast to the two-melanocyte width of the dorsal stripe typically observed in wt larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000544-g007">Figure 7D</xref>), dorsal melanocyte stripes in <italic>Tg(cmv:kitla)</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000544-g007">Figure 7E</xref>), or AG1478 treated, <italic>Tg(cmv:kitla)</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000544-g007">Figure 7F</xref>) larvae are often four or six melanocytes wide, respectively. In these experiments, this effect is much less pronounced in the tail of AG1478-treated <italic>Tg(cmv:kitla)</italic> larvae (55.6&#x000b1;9.3 melanocytes, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000544-g007">Figure 7C</xref>). Compared with untreated <italic>Tg(cmv:kitla)</italic> (45.2&#x000b1;6.7 melanocytes, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000544-g007">Figure 7C</xref>) this effect is less than a 20&#x00025; increase (P&#x0003c;0.05). That AG1478 enhances <italic>Tg(cmv:kitla)</italic>-induced overproduction of melanocytes primarily in the trunk region where AG1478 prevents the establishment of MSCs reinforces our conclusions developed above that <italic>kitla</italic> overexpression is acting on the MSC lineage, rather than embryonic melanoblasts and melanocytes, to cause overproduction of melanocytes.</p><p>To rule out the possibility that <italic>kitla</italic> is recruiting cells from the ontogenetic lineage when the MSCs are blocked with AG1478, we treated <italic>Tg(cmv:kitla)</italic> larvae with both AG1478 and ICI-118,551 (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000544-g006">Figure 6A and 6B</xref>). When <italic>Tg(cmv:kitla)</italic> larva are treated with AG1478 and ICI-118,551 together, we observed even fewer ontogenetic melanocytes (44.6&#x00025; of that of WT). This result provides further evidence that <italic>kitla</italic> is capable of recruiting the AG1478 pre-MSC. That fewer ICI-118,551-insensitive melanocytes develop in <italic>Tg(cmv:kitla)</italic> AG1478-treated larva might suggest that the proliferation of the ontogenetic melanoblast lineage is suppressed when the stem cell lineage is overproliferating to such an extent (230&#x00025; of wild type).</p><p>Taken together, four lines of evidence converge to indicate that the excess melanocytes that develop following overexpression of <italic>kitla</italic> arise from the MSC lineage, rather than the ontogenetic (ErbB-independent) lineage. These include (1) overexpression of <italic>kitla</italic> is capable of inducing an excess of melanocytes after 4 dpf when embryonic melanoblasts are not present; (2) all excess melanocytes arise through cell division after <italic>kitla</italic> overexpression; (3) ICI-118,551, which does not affect embryonic melanocyte number, blocks the increase in <italic>kitla</italic> overexpressing animals and lastly; (4) AG1478, acts specifically in the MSC lineage, modifies the number of excess melanocytes in <italic>kitla</italic> overexpressing animals.</p><p>The foregoing analysis now allows us to draw two conclusions. First, it suggests that AG1478 treatment does not kill the MSC, but rather results in a cell that is now recruitable by excess <italic>kitla</italic>. This cell does not have the full regulative abilities of a MSC, as evidenced by the fact that it cannot respond to ablation of embryonic melanocytes by making new melanocytes. Its presence, rather than immediate death, is revealed by its responsiveness to excess <italic>kitla</italic>. A parsimonious interpretation is that AG1478 prevents&#x02014;and <italic>erbb3b</italic> is required for&#x02014;the progression of a precursor to the fully regulative MSC. The second conclusion is that this precursor, that we refer to as a pre-MSC, is responsive to <italic>kit</italic> signaling. Together with the findings that <italic>kitla</italic> overexpression after 4 days induces overproduction of new melanocytes through cell division of undifferentiated precursors (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000544-g005">Figure 5</xref>) from the MSC lineage (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000544-g006">Figure 6</xref>) now provides functional evidence for a role of <italic>kit</italic> signaling in both the pre-MSC and the MSC itself in recruiting these cells to divide and produce more melanocytes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we have presented evidence for several conclusions regarding the origin and recruitment of zebrafish adult melanocyte stem cells (MSC). Our model for MSC establishment and recruitment is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000544-g008">Figure 8</xref>, and has four salient features. First, the establishment of the MSC requires ErbB activity to progress from a pre-MSC to a MSC state. Second, the MSCs responsible for regeneration in the larva may be identical to stem cells previously shown to be involved in metamorphic patterning of the adult fish <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000544-Budi1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>. Third, primary ontogenetic, or embryonic, melanocytes develop independently of the MSC. Fourth, ectopic overexpression of <italic>kitla</italic> can recruit both the MSC and the ErbB inhibitor-arrested pre-MSC. The broader implications for these findings are discussed in more depth below.</p><fig id="pgen-1000544-g008" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1000544.g008</object-id><label>Figure 8</label><caption><title>Model for the parallel establishment of the zebrafish embryonic melanocyte lineage and the adult melanocyte stem cell lineage.</title><p>Our results indicate that there are two distinct melanocyte lineages that develop in the zebrafish embryo: the embryonic or ontogenetic melanocyte lineage and the regenerative and metamorphic melanocyte lineage. In embryonic development, neural crest cells (squares) give rise to <italic>dct&#x0002b;</italic> melanoblasts (triangles), which later develop into embryonic melanocytes (black star). The regeneration and metamorphic lineage develops in parallel to embryonic melanocytes, prior to 48 hpf and presumably from the neural crest. The establishment of melanocyte stem cells (MSCs, dark circle) require ErbB signaling to progress from the pre-MSC state (light circle). The MSC can self-renew (circular arrow) and give rise to melanoblasts and melanocytes during metamorphosis or regeneration, when inhibition from embryonic melanocytes (block arrow) is relieved. The MSC&#x02013;derived melanocytes are sensitive to developmental blockade by ICI-118,551 after the <italic>dct</italic>&#x0002b; melanoblast stage.

Although we lack direct markers for the melanocyte stem cell, we can draw strong inferences about its existence and regulation from the ability of larvae to regenerate melanocytes, the formation of new melanocytes upon pigment pattern metamorphosis, or the regeneration of melanocyte stripes in the regenerating adult fin. We have previously shown that following ablation of embryonic melanocytes, cells with stem cell properties are recruited to replace or regenerate the missing melanocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000544-Yang1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. This notion is supported by BrdU incorporation experiments that showed that this cell and its daughters divide several times in response to embryonic melanocyte ablation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000544-Yang1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>. Here we show that treatment with ErbB inhibitor prevents melanocyte regeneration. We have mapped the timing of ErbB inhibitor action and shown that ErbB signaling is required during periods of embryonic development coincident with ontogenetic melanocyte migration and differentiation (14&#x02013;48 hpf). That ErbB inhibitors are blocking the establishment of the MSC, rather than subsequent stages of MSC recruitment, renewal, or differentiation, is demonstrated positively by the fact that exposure of the larvae to the ErbB inhibitor prior to MoTP-induced melanocyte ablation blocks regeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000544-g002">Figure 2</xref>). That exposure to ErbB inhibitor during or after MoTP treatment has no effect on subsequent melanocyte regeneration suggests that ErbB signaling has no role in recruitment, renewal, or differentiation of this lineage. Thus, we conclude that the MSC is established during embryonic development during stages of melanocyte migration from the neural crest, and that establishment of the MSC requires ErbB signaling.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Regeneration and Metamorphosis Depend on a Shared Melanocyte Stem Cell</title><p>Our finding that larval melanocyte regeneration was sensitive to ErbB signal inhibition led us to explore whether the <italic>erbb3b</italic> mutant was also defective for larval melanocyte regeneration following ablation with MoTP. We find that embryos treated with ErbB inhibitor and the <italic>erbb3b</italic> (<italic>picasso</italic>) mutant, which are both defective for metamorphic melanocyte development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000544-Budi1">&#x0005b;23&#x0005d;</xref>, are also defective for larval melanocyte regeneration. We also find that the ErbB inhibitor acted to block regeneration early, from 9&#x02013;48 hpf, which is at a similar embryonic stage that it was found to prevent melanocyte development during metamorphosis (12&#x02013;22 hpf). Together, these results suggest that both metamorphic melanocytes and regeneration melanocytes rely on the same ErbB-dependent MSCs. The alternative possibility is that the zebrafish has two distinct populations of MSCs established at similar times with similar requirements for ErbB signaling. The development of persistent labeling techniques for long-term clonal analysis will be required to investigate the relationship between different melanocyte populations to more firmly rule out this latter possibility.</p><p>Our interpretation that larval regeneration melanocytes and metamorphic melanocytes arise from the same adult stem cells sheds some light on how adult stem cells may be regulated by different mechanisms of repression or induction at different stages of development. During larval stages (3&#x02013;14 days), melanocyte development is nearly static, with few or no new melanocytes developing during this period (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000544-Milos1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>). That ablation of embryonic melanocytes during this stage activates the MSC argues that the MSC is repressed by differentiated embryonic melanocytes. Such repression might be direct interaction (as we propose in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000544-g008">Figure 8</xref>) or mediated by other cells, such as a yet unidentified MSC niche, that in turn activates the MSC when the melanocyte is ablated. In contrast, metamorphosis is a concerted set of developmental events initiated by thyroid hormone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000544-Brown1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref> in the presence of embryonic melanocytes, some of which can persist into the adult pattern <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000544-Parichy2">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>. This argues that either the signals of metamorphosis override embryonic melanocyte repression of the MSC, or that embryonic melanocytes no longer repress the MSC during this developmental change. Thus, the differences in mechanisms between MSC recruitment during regeneration and metamorphosis will provide useful insights into the regulation of adult stem cells.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Independent Lineage for Ontogenetic and Regenerative Melanocytes</title><p>This study now provides strong evidence for two distinct melanocyte lineages that populate the larval zebrafish. One melanocyte population, which we have discussed extensively in this study, is derived from an ErbB-dependent melanocyte stem cell (bold circle in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000544-g008">Figure 8</xref>), and develops in response to ablation of earlier developing melanocytes. This earlier population, which we refer to as embryonic or ontogenetic melanocytes, develops directly from neural crest cells, and we argue does not develop from an adult stem cell-like intermediate. It is difficult to formally rule out such a stem cell precursor for the ontogenetic lineage, but it is clear from the fact that their development is unperturbed in mutants for <italic>erbb3b</italic> or following treatment with ErbB inhibitors that the ErbB-dependent MSC is not a precursor for ontogenetic melanocytes. Moreover, that the ErbB independent melanocyte precursors in the ontogenetic lineage cannot regulate the larval pigment pattern when the ErbB-dependent MSCs are blocked suggests that a precursor for these cells do not persist in the larva through self-renewal. Self-renewal, in contrast to depletion during development, is a hallmark for embryonic or adult stem cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000544-Lajtha1">&#x0005b;33&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The two distinct mechanisms for development, direct and stem cell-derived, have also been argued for the development of melanocytes in the mouse. In this case, the differentiated melanocytes of the first hair follicle are the result of direct development, while the melanocytes of subsequent hair follicle cycle are thought to derive from a MSC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000544-Mak1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. Thus, although the biology of embryonic pigmentation and metamorphosis in zebrafish superficially appears distinct from that of mammals, these two results now suggest that the embryonic melanocytes in zebrafish are analogous to those of the first hair follicle in mouse, and post-embryonic melanocytes that appear during regeneration or metamorphosis are analogous to the melanocytes of second and subsequent hair follicles. Further investigation of each model organism will determine the extent of the common requirements and potential homologous mechanisms and will allow us to draw stronger conclusions for understanding the origin of the MSC.</p><p>That both mammals and zebrafish appear to develop melanocytes directly during embryogenesis and then subsequently through adult stem cells raises the question of whether such modes of development are a general theme in metazoan development. Certainly in insects such as <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the embryo sets aside cells that will develop via imaginal discs to then replace the larval structure with the adult structures. The imaginal discs are not themselves stem cells, and their development in the adult is largely terminal. Yet in recent years, adult stem cells that provide for cell turnover in the gut and other tissues have been described, raising the possibility that the Drosophila embryo may also establish adult stem cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000544-Micchelli1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000544-Yu1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. Vertebrates seem to lack anything like the imaginal discs of the fruit fly, and it may be that most post-embryonic growth comes from adult stem cells. A parallel example to what we describe here for embryonic (direct developing) and stem cell-derived melanocytes may be provided by the development of the blood. While the blood cells of the adult vertebrate, referred to as definitive hematopoiesis, develop from a well characterized adult stem cell called the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC), primitive hematopoiesis, because of its transient nature, has had no such self-renewing adult stem cell ascribed to it <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000544-Orkin1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>. Clonal analysis in <italic>Xenopus</italic> with these two populations of blood origin indicates that the primitive and definitive blood are derived from independent lineages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000544-CiauUitz1">&#x0005b;38&#x0005d;</xref>. Similar clonal analysis will be required to further examine the relationship between the melanocyte stem cell we have described here and the embryonic melanocyte lineage. Exploration of other types of adult stem cells and their corresponding embryonic tissues will reveal whether parallel development of the embryo and the establishment of the adult stem cell from distinct lineages is a general theme in vertebrate development.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Fish Rearing and Stocks</title><p>Adult fish were maintained at 25&#x02013;27&#x000b0;C, 14L&#x02236;10D standard treatment (Westerfield, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://zfin.org/zf_info/zfbook/zfbk.html">http://zfin.org/zf_info/zfbook/zfbk.html</ext-link>).
