As in other complex diseases, the genetic risk is thought to consist of several genetic variants and their possible interactions. Elucidation of the genetic component of any complex trait most likely requires simultaneous examination of various genes in large and well-characterized study samples. Our study explores the role in cardiovascular disease of four thrombosis genes: coagulation factor V, intercellular adhesion molecule 1, protein C, and thrombomodulin. These genes form a physiological pathway that is part of the coagulation cascade. Their defects, such as the Leiden mutation in factor V gene, predispose to venous thrombosis, making them tempting candidates for involvement with cardiovascular events. Given the interactions of these genes at the molecular level, a logical way to explore their genetic effects is simultanous rather than gene-specific analysis of all the four genes, aiming to illustrate their possible interplay. The study setting combines classification trees with classic genetic analyses and covers all known common variants of the genes. The results imply that the variants in these four genes contribute to disease risk either alone or in various allelic combinations.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Auro K, Alanne M, Kristiansson K, Silander K, Kuulasmaa K, et al.

We hypothesize that analyzing allelic variants of several genes encoding components of the same physiological cascade will prove to be a more powerful approach to shedding light on CVD risk mechanisms than are studies on single candidates. Analyses comprising several genes belonging to the same pathway may reveal cumulative allelic effects. When acting together, these gene variants may affect the disease risk more profoundly than do the single predisposing variants. We covered common variants of <italic>F5, ICAM1, PROC</italic>, and <italic>THBD</italic> genes and assessed their role in CVD in two prospective and independently sampled population cohorts of Finns. To address the single gene variants and their interplay in cardiovascular traits, we chose a two-step strategy. We first aimed to identify the variants contributing most to the CVD risk in our study sample using classification-trees. Second, based on these analyses, we studied a subset of the most important SNPs by classical genetic analyses, first as independent markers and then as pair-wise combinations as deviation from the multiplicative model of genetic interaction. Our study identified several variants predisposing to CVD as single or cooperating markers.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study Samples</title><p>We utilized two large, independently sampled, and prospectively followed population cohorts from Finland, FINRISK-92 (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 5,999, follow-up 1992&#x02013;2001) and FINRISK-97 (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 8,141, follow-up 1997&#x02013;2003). Subjects for genotyping were selected according to a case-cohort design from among 14,140 FINRISK participants. As cases in this study, we consider those with an incident coronary event (coronary heart disease &#x0005b;CHD&#x0005d;, <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 401) or ischemic stroke (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 149) during follow-up and did not have acute coronary events or strokes before the baseline examination, and everyone deceased from any reason during follow-up (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 610). In addition, individuals having experienced cardiovascular events at baseline were genotyped, but baseline CVD was not utilized as an endpoint in this study. International Classification of Diseases (ICD) &#x02212;9 and &#x02212;10 codes for fatal coronary events were 410&#x02013;414 and 798, and I20&#x02013;I25, I46, R96, R98, R99, and for nonfatal coronary events 410&#x02013;411 (ICD-9) and I20.0 and I21&#x02013;I22 (ICD-10). For fatal and nonfatal ischemic strokes, ICD-9 codes 433 (excluding 4330X, 4331X, and 4339X of the Finnish modification of ICD-9), 434 (excluding 4349X), and ICD-10 code I63 were used. The ICD-10 revision has been used in Finland since January 1996. We will denote the combination of coronary event and ischemic stroke endpoints by CVD. Because 21 individuals had both an incident coronary event and an incident ischemic stroke, the total number of individuals having incident CVD events was 528. Of the 610 deceased, 138 also had an incident CVD event. Random subcohorts, selected with age-dependent probabilities, were drawn from the original cohorts to represent the general study populations (FINRISK-92 <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 400, FINRISK-97 <italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 386). Thus, the subcohorts also included individuals having CVD events at baseline (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 88) or during follow-up (<italic>n</italic> &#x0003d; 72). This selection yielded a study sample of 2,222 individuals for genotyping (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0030120-t001">Table 1</xref>). Information on the traditional CVD risk factors (serum cholesterol, triglyceride (TG), and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels, blood pressure, anthropomorphic measures, smoking, medication, disease, and family history) as well as whole blood samples for DNA were collected at baseline.

(3) Finally, to estimate whether the SNPs chosen at stage 1 were the informative ones required a separate sensitivity analysis. All SNPs were analyzed in Cox's proportional hazards, coding the SNPs as 1&#x02013;0 assuming dominant inheritance.</p><p>AnswerTree is a classification-tree algorithm that attempts to find a variable and a cutpoint for the variable to split a dataset to best predict disease outcome. This split is called the root node. The algorithm is then applied to the resulting subgroups of the dataset accordingly, and the process is continued to form a tree. In our application of the algorithm, SNPs were coded as 0 (minor allele carriers) to 1 (major allele homozygotes) assuming dominant inheritance and analyzed together with the traditional risk factors, using incident CVD events as the endpoint. Of the possible algorithms we used exhaustive chi-squared automatic interaction detector (CHAID), which allows more than two sister nodes in a split if necessary and thus was thought to model the biological risk caused by the phenotypic risk factors, for example cholesterol values, better than a strictly bifurcated split, and moreover, it allows control of a number of steps in the tree: To keep the tree structure simple and to discover combinations of predisposing factors affecting relatively large groups of individuals, we set the minimum root node size at 20 and the minimum end node size at 10. Maximum branch level in the trees was limited to five. The significance of all splits was calculated as &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup></p><p>To search for all well-supported splits and to reduce the extent to which the root node in the overall analysis may obscure other important splits we decided, instead of growing a single tree, to grow a forest of trees: a collection of classification trees achieved by bootstrap techniques using random subsamples and other criteria. In order to grow the forest, we took ten random subsamples of 60&#x00025; of the men and ten random subsamples of 60&#x00025; of the women of the combination of the FINRISK-92 and &#x02212;97 cohorts. First, one tree was grown for each subsample to determine the significant splits. These 20 trees included altogether 50 significant splits for men and 45 for women (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0030120-t001">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-0030120-t002">2</xref>). Using these significant splits from the 20 trees as root nodes we grew a forest of 50 trees for men and 45 trees for women still utilizing the subsample data. The SNPs present in &#x0003e;10&#x00025; of the sex-specific trees were selected for further analysis. Because the data used in the classification-tree analysis originated from a single dataset, combining the two cohorts, no cross validation among the samples was performed.</p><table-wrap id="pgen-0030120-t002" content-type="2col" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Significant Splits (Sample-Specific <italic>p</italic>-Value, &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup>) Seen in Classification-Trees Grown in AnswerTree3.0 with Ten Random Female Datasets, Each Containing 60&#x00025; of the Original Data</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pgen.0030120.t002"/></table-wrap><p>At stage 2, we first used the combined data set of FINRISK-92 and &#x02212;97 cohorts to gain maximum power, but also both cohorts separately to assess the consistency of the findings. The allele distributions of the selected SNPs between the cases and the subcohort (excluding cases and baseline CVD) were compared with Pearson's &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup>. The relation of each SNP to the common CVD risk factors (TG, total cholesterol &#x0005b;TC&#x0005d;, HDL cholesterol &#x0005b;HDL&#x0005d;, TC/HDL ratio, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, CRP, body mass index &#x0005b;BMI&#x0005d;, and waist-to-hip ratio &#x0005b;WHR&#x0005d;) was analyzed separately for each risk factor with an age-, sex-, and cohort-adjusted general linear model. To achieve normality, HDL and CRP were log transformed. Hazard ratios for all selected SNPs and their pair-wise combinations (with interaction terms, as deviation from the multiplicative model of interaction) were calculated with Cox's proportional hazards model, with age at baseline, (sex), TC/HDL ratio, BMI, smoking, diabetes, hypertension, and CRP as covariates. Time from baseline served as the time parameter. The analysis was stratified by eastern and western Finland and additionally by cohort when combining the two datasets. Total mortality, incident coronary, incident ischemic stroke, and incident CVD (coronary and stroke events combined) events served as endpoints. We first performed sex-specific analyses and then combined men and women, under additive, dominant, and recessive inheritance models. The <italic>F5</italic> Leiden mutation was analyzed only with the dominant model, due to low minor allele frequency. Multiple testing was addressed by performing all analyses in the two separate cohorts, as well as with false-discovery rate (FDR). FDR was calculated within sex- and endpoint-specific groups. SNP combinations were analyzed with interaction terms as deviation from the multiplicative model (i.e., interaction HR different from the product of the independent SNP HRs) in Cox's model adjusted for the same risk factors as with the single SNPs. With interaction terms, the recessive model of inheritance was selected for a SNP if it showed significant association in the single SNP analyses, otherwise the dominant model was used to gain power.

This two-step analysis strategy used classification-trees to select a subset of SNPs from a larger set of genome-wide haplotype tagging SNPs for further genetic analyses of allelic covariance and hazard ratios. The importance of the SNPs excluded from the further analyses was assessed with a separate sensitivity analysis. Even though all genetic variants, or combinations of them, were required to show consistent effects in both the independent cohorts to be considered significant, only functional studies and replications in other populations will validate the importance of these findings for CVD. This may prove a valuable approach in whole-genome association analyses, where the amount of genetic data is overwhelming.</p><p>Classification-trees structure data by searching first for the variable best explaining the determined endpoint and splitting the dataset into subgroups according to this variable. The search continues in the specified subgroups, which again split into smaller groups accordingly. Classification-trees are thus useful in organizing noisy datasets comprising multiple variables, and can be used to identify specific pathways determining an outcome or specific subgroups having similarities leading to this outcome. Gruenewald et al. &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030120-b028">28</xref>&#x0005d; utilized classification-trees to identify risk markers for mortality in an elderly population, and determined several mortality-predictive pathways consisting of different combinations of markers, in both men and women. Their study highlights the multiplicity of solutions leading to the same outcome and illustrates how classification-trees can prove useful in structuring multiple variables in an organized manner. In our data, the classification-tree analysis itself failed to detect consistent gene&#x02013;gene or gene&#x02013;environment interaction patterns, but was useful in reducing the number of SNPs analyzed with other models. In our dataset, the forest of trees demonstrated that the influence of any tested SNP on cardiovascular events was evident only after first splitting a tree by one or more traditional risk factors, such as cholesterol level, BMI, or diabetes. This fits well the current understanding of the nature of the complex diseases: setting aside some rare, strictly familial cases of CVD, the vast majority of cardiovascular diseases are likely to be characterized by several low-predisposing genes and their possible interactions. In these cases, the traditional phenotypic risk factors play a stronger role, and genetic factors are more likely to lurk in the background. Classification-trees could therefore prove powerful also in determining subsets, &#x0201c;branches,&#x0201d; of individuals among whom the genetic variants are especially evident risk factors. For example, the <italic>F5</italic> Leiden mutation has been suggested to be associated with CVD among young women with an unhealthy lifestyle &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030120-b029">29</xref>&#x0005d;.</p><p>Our study identified several thrombosis-related risk variants&#x02014;both single SNPs and their pair-wise combinations&#x02014;for coronary events, ischemic strokes, and total mortality, showing consistent association in two independently selected Finnish population cohorts. Thrombosis is a central step in the pathogenesis of myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke. The ruptured wall of a coronary plaque is covered with thrombosis leading either to local obstruction of circulation or emboli traveling in more peripheral arterial branches. Thus, variants in thrombosis genes are also biologically relevant risk factors for coronary and stroke events. Our observations on various allelic combinations from several genes associating with CVD events highlight the importance of wide-perspective studies concentrating on numerous genes and their allelic variants to explore the genetic background of any complex trait. One should proceed cautiously when drawing biological conclusions from statistical interaction models: the underlying biological processes are likely to be highly complex, and evidence of combined effects in a statistical sense fails to do justice to this complexity. Our results indicate, however, that SNP combinations may reveal risk variants that could remain unnoticed when one is concentrating purely on single SNPs; SNP combinations could therefore be one step forward in the study of complex traits. Here, the CVD-associated variants of the candidate genes, excluding the Leiden mutation, represent either intronic or intragenic SNPs, likely linked to other, functional variants contributing to the true disease predisposition.</p><p>Studies on the <italic>F5</italic> Leiden mutation in arterial thrombosis have been controversial &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030120-b030">30</xref>&#x0005d;, but a recent meta-analysis suggests that the <italic>F5</italic> Leiden mutation contributes significantly to coronary events &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030120-b031">31</xref>&#x0005d;. The <italic>F5</italic> Leiden mutation also associated with ischemic stroke in children &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030120-b032">32</xref>&#x0005d;. In our study, men carrying the risk (minor) allele of <italic>F5</italic> Leiden were at a 4.47-fold increased risk for ischemic stroke, and a suggestive finding emerged when women were included in the analysis. The Leiden mutation also contributed to CVD risk in men jointly with a <italic>THBD</italic> SNP <italic>rs6048519</italic>. Addressing potential interactions for rare allelic variants, or to analyze the real impact of the Leiden mutation, requires very large datasets &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030120-b031">31</xref>&#x0005d;. Our earlier results implied that in our study cohorts <italic>THBD</italic> variants alone seemed to play no role in CVD &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030120-b015">15</xref>&#x0005d;, but our new data from this study suggest that <italic>THBD</italic> may contribute to CVD in combination with other risk factors. Podgoreanu and colleagues reported an association of <italic>ICAM1</italic> SNP <italic>rs5498</italic> with postoperative myocardial infarction &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen-0030120-b019">19</xref>&#x0005d;. This SNP was in our population in strong LD (<italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> &#x0003d; 0.82) with SNP <italic>rs3093030,</italic> but with no association with CVD. The wide confidence intervals in the analyses of female stroke cases reflect the need for larger study cohorts. In the present study, the number of female stroke participants was especially limited.</p><p>This is, to our knowledge, the first study to cover all known common allelic variants in <italic>F5, ICAM1, PROC,</italic> and <italic>THBD</italic> genes, analyzing them as a physiological &#x0201c;pathway&#x0201d; entity and assessing their relationship with the traditional CVD risk factors. Multiple testing is an emerging issue in all complex genetics studies comprising several markers. We adjusted the findings of the final analysis step for multiple testing using the FDR, although this does not adjust for the fact that the earlier selection of SNPs by use of classification-trees was done on the same dataset. We chose to use 10&#x00025; as a limit in the FDR analyses, stating that with this limit, 90&#x00025; of the findings are expected to be true positives, whereas 10&#x00025; could still be false positives. In addtition, the sensitivity analysis suggested that the classification-tree approach was able to select the informative SNPs, excluding the less informative ones. The major strength of this study is to further minimize the possibility of false-positive findings by requiring consistency in the findings in two separate cohorts of the same population. However, these results still need replication in other independent studies and populations. The major limitation of this study is its cohort size; studies comprising several hundred cases in each category are needed to profoundly address gene&#x02013;gene interactions, especially once these types of analyses are reaching genome-wide datasets of thousands of genes. Another limitation of the study sample is the lack of plasma concentrations of the hemostatic factors.</p><p>In conclusion, combining data from several genes encoding components of the same biological pathway and analyzing the impact of genes together with other relevant risk factors may prove useful in regard to studying diseases with polygenic structures. Currently, sensible ways are called for to analyze the overwhelming information load produced by studies containing various genes and many variants. Our approach provides one example for selecting the informative variants from the background. Our results from the thrombosis cascade of four genes shed light on the interplay of these gene variants' roles in arterial thrombosis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pgen-0030120-sg001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><title>Linkage Disequilibrium Pattern (<italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup>) and Haplotype Blocks of the Coagulation Factor V SNPs Genotyped</title><p>(71 KB JPG)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pgen.0030120.sg001.jpg" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="jpeg"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pgen-0030120-st001"><label>Table S1</label><caption><title>Significant Splits (Sample-Specific <italic>p</italic>-Value, &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup>) Seen in Classification-Trees Grown in AnswerTree3.0 with Ten Random Male Datasets, Each Containing 60&#x00025; of the Original Data</title><p>SNPs were analyzed as 0 (minor allele carriers) to 1 (major allele homozygotes).</p><p>(11 KB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pgen.0030120.st001.doc" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pgen-0030120-st002"><label>Table S2</label><caption><title>Minor Allele Frequencies of All SNPs Analyzed</title><p>(141 KB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pgen.0030120.st002.doc" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pgen-0030120-st003"><label>Table S3</label><caption><title>Estimates for the SNPs Contributing to the Pair-Wise SNP Combinations Presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen-0030120-st006">Table S6</xref></title><p>(12 KB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pgen.0030120.st003.doc" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pgen-0030120-st004"><label>Table S4</label><caption><title>Association of the SNPs Studied with Incident Coronary Events in Time-to-Event Analysis in Both Sexes</title><p>Covariates: age at baseline, (sex, cohort), smoking, hypertension, TC/HDL, BMI, diabetes, and CRP).
