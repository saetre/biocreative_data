We investigated the effect of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) on annexin A2 expression and related intracellular signaling mechanisms in a mouse model of ischemia-induced retinal neovascularization.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>Annexin A2 expression and the effect of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) on annexin A2 ex pression in retinal neovascularization were assayed by real-time PCR, western blot analysis. The effect of Annexin A2 on retinal neovascularization were assayed by siRNA interference and overexpression of Annexin A2, fluorescence imaging, and immunofluorescence histochemistry in a mouse model of ischemia-induced retinal neovascularization.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Expression of annexin A2 mRNA and protein were increased in the mouse model of ischemia-induced retinal neovascularization and in RF/6A cells treated with VEGF. In RF/6A cells, increased expression of annexin A2 was inhibited by the VEGF receptor 2 (VEGFR2) inhibitor SU10944, and by anti-VEGFR2 neutralizing antibody, and was increased by VEGF. Mice with ischemic retinopathy showed increased expression of annexin A2 in vascular endothelial cells, and enhanced retinal neovascularization after intraocular injection of an adenoviral vector containing an annexin A2 expression cassette. Conversely, annexin A2 knockdown suppressed retinal neovascularization in these mice.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>These findings suggest that annexin A2 might induce retinal neovascularization through a VEGF-VEGFR2 pathway in ischemia-induced retina neovascularization.

Studies have revealed that vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is an important element for many angiogenic processes such as diabetic retinopathy and tumor neovascularization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r2">2</xref>]. Thus, there is heightened interest in understanding the importance of annexin A2 in regulating the retinal angiogenic process.</p><p>The targets of VEGF are two homologous but distinct tyrosine kinase receptors: the feline McDonough strain (fms)-like tyrosine kinase receptor Flt-1 (VEGFR1) and the fetal liver kinase-1 receptor Flk-1 (VEGFR2), also called KDR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r3">3</xref>]. Expression of these receptors increases under pathological conditions in which hypoxia is a main feature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r4">4</xref>]. VEGF binds to its receptors and stimulates a variety of signaling molecules, resulting in promotion of neovascularization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r7">7</xref>]. Both extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and protein kinase C (PKC) are activated by VEGF and contribute to the induction of endothelial cell proliferation and migration that are essential for regulation of angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r9">9</xref>].</p><p>Annexin A2, a cytosolic phospholipid and Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding protein, is a receptor of many angiogenesis-related proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r10">10</xref>], such as angiostatin and tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA). Annexin A2 can form heterotetrameric complexes on the surface of endothelial cells with the annexin A2 light chain (called S100A10 or p11), and this stimulates generation of t-PA dependent plasmin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r11">11</xref>]. Plasmin is a highly reactive enzyme that is physiologically involved in fibrinolysis and plays an important role in neoangiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r12">12</xref>]. In addition, annexin A2 is a substrate of PKC&#x003b1;, PKC&#x003b2;I, and PKC&#x003b2;II kinases in cells. Phosphorylation of annexin A2 serine 25 is associated with its nuclear entry, DNA synthesis, and cell proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r13">13</xref>]. However, annexin A2 has not been reported to participate in other angiogenetic mechanisms, such as the VEGF/VEGFR1 or VEGF/VEGFR2 pathways in pathological neovascularization.</p><p>The function and regulatory role of annexin A2 in retinal neovascularization have not been studied extensively. Here we describe a preliminary investigation of the expression of annexin A2, its effect on angiogenesis, and its functional relationship with VEGF in a mouse model of ischemia-induced retinal neovascularization model and in RF/6A cells.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The following materials were used.

Briefly, full-length mouse Annexin A2 cDNA was amplified by PCR with the primer set of 5&#x02032;-GAG GAT CCA TGT CTA CTG TTC ACG AA-3&#x02032; and 5&#x02032;-GGA CTA GTT CAT CTC CAC CAC ACA-3&#x02032;. After double digestion with BamH I and Spe I, human annexin A2, was cloned into pENTR/CMV-EGFP vector through corresponding sites. The expression of the EGFP-Annexin A2 fusion protein was verified by western blot and fluorescence microscopy. An adenovirus vector expression Kit (TaKaRa, Ohtsu, Japan) was used to achieve in vivo homologous recombination between the transfer cassette bearing the annexin A2 expression unit and the adenovirus genome, as well as the restriction enzyme-digested adenovirus genome tagged with terminal protein in 293 cells. Plaque-purified adenoviruses were propagated in 293 cells. The viral lysates were purified and concentrated through double rounds of CsCl step gradients.</p></sec><sec><title>Cell culture</title><p>The choroid-retinal endothelial cells line RF/6Awas obtained from the cell bank of the Chinese Academy of Science in Shanghai, China.

Oxygen concentration was measured with an oximeter (Toptronic, Milan, Italy). At the end of the oxygen exposure (day 12) and 5 days after return to normoxic conditions, the pups were killed, and retinal alterations were observed. Mice of the same strain and of the same age were kept in room air and used as control subjects.

This expression of annexin A2 is regulated by many functional proteins, such as VEGF, VEGFR2, and PKC. Suppressing the ischemia-induced expression of VEGFR2 with anti&#x02013;VEGFR2 monoclonal antibody, or of PKC with PKC inhibitors (Calphostin C, LY333531) suppressed the increase in annexin A2 mRNA. This suggests that VEGF, VEGFR2, and PKC may be involved in regulating the expression of annexin A2, and that VEGF and VEGFR2 may play major roles.</p><p>These studies in vitro show that the annexin A2 expression of the mRNA and protein in RF/6A cells are dramatically upregulated by VEGF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>) in a dose-dependent manner, and the increase in annexin A2 levels of the mRNA and protein in response to VEGF treatment was caused by transcriptional activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref>). These indicate that annexin A2 is upregulated by VEGF in vascular endothelial cells in ischemic retina.</p><p>Immunofluorescent staining with an antibody that recognizes murine annexin A2 did not show a detectable signal in normal retinas, but ischemic retinas of age-matched mice showed staining for annexin A2 on the retina surface and in vascular endothelial cells. This upregulation of endogenous annexin A2 may not be a major factor like VEGF in encouraging retinal neovascularization, but it modulates the response; knockdown of annexin A2 by injection of Si annexin A2 significantly decreased neovascularization compared with control eyes injected with Si annexin A2_M. Furthermore, bolstering endogenous levels of annexin A2 by injecting an Ad annexin A2 vector significantly increased retinal neovascularization. Therefore, annexin A2 may act in a positive feedback loop to help promote neovascularization in the retina, as has been postulated for tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r22">22</xref>].</p><p>Retinal neovascularization is a prevalent cause of blindness and the focus of an intense effort to find selective molecular treatments. This effort has received an important boost from demonstrations that VEGF is a stimulator for both retinal and choroidal neovascularization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r23">23</xref>]. Retinal ischemia (or hypoxia) is the central pathogenic feature of retinal neovascularization and one of its major consequences is upregulation of VEGF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r24">24</xref>]. Retinal neovascularization is suppressed by agents that bind VEGF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r26">26</xref>] or block VEGF receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r28">28</xref>]. Although retinal ischemia (or hypoxia) is the central pathogenic feature of retinal neovascularization, VEGF is a necessary stimulator, because VEGF receptor kinase inhibitors or other agents that bind VEGF strongly suppress retinal neovascularization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r29">29</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r31">31</xref>]. Even though the mechanism of the synergistic effect of annexin A2 is unknown in ischemia retina, there is also no evidence appearing to directly effect of annexin A2 on VEGF; it may have synergistic activity in combination with agents that bind VEGF or by binding the mRNA of VEGF.</p><p>These data support the hypothesis that annexin A2 acts as an activator of retinal neovascularization that is upregulated by VEGFR2 or a conjugate of VEGF and VEGFR2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Figure 8</xref>). This is well illustrated by the relationship between annexin A2 and VEGF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f8">Figure 8</xref>). In hypoxia, VEGF and annexin A2 transcription are upregulated by hypoxia inducible factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r32">32</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r34">34</xref>]. The biologic activity of secreted VEGF is further influenced by hypoxia-inducible expression of VEGFR2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r35">35</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r37">37</xref>]. At the same time, VEGF directly effect on the expression of annexin A2, or a combination of VEGF and VEGFR2 induces the expression of annexin A2. Annexin A2 is a substrate protein of PKC. Activation of annexin A2 phosphorylation is promoted by the PKC signaling pathway which promote ischemic retina neovascularization. Otherwise, serine 25 phosphorylation of annexin A2 may be associated with the nuclear entry of annexin A2, mRNA expression of VEGF, and endothelial cell proliferation. Therefore, on one hand, annexin A2 as one of the receptors for plasminogen and tPA is involved in the angiogenic process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="r38">38</xref>]. On the other hand, presumably annexin A2 as a mRNA binding protein influences the stability of mRNA expression of VEGF, or is involved in the angiogenic process by VEGF/VEGFR pathway.</p><fig id="f8" fig-type="figure" position="float"><label>Figure 8</label><caption><p>Diagram of signal transduction cascades investigated in this study. In hypoxia, VEGF and annexin A2 transcription was upregulated by hypoxia inducible factor. VEGF directly effect on the expression of annexin A2, or a combination of VEGF and VEGFR2 induced the expression of annexin A2 on the surface of the cell membrane. VEGF and VEGFR2 also may be promote Annexin A2 expression by PKC pathway. Annexin A2 further influenced neovascularization.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="mv-v15-1231-f8"/></fig><p>In summary, we have demonstrated that increased expression of annexin A2 in ischemic retinas is induced by increased levels of VEGF mRNA. This inductive effect of VEGF for annexin A2 is mainly regulated by the expression level of VEGFR2 mRNA. Blocking the ischemia-induced rise in annexin A2 mRNA with Si annexin A2 also inhibits retinal neovascularization in ischemic retinas. Together our data clearly identify annexin A2 as a new functional protein in VEGF expression in retinal neovascularization induced by hypoxia. Compelling evidence from the literature and our own findings suggest that annexin A2 may be a potential target for the development of effective therapeutic strategies for the treatment of retinal neovascularization.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This study was funded by the National Foundation of China (Nos. 30572000 and 30772395) and Army Medical Hygiene Research
