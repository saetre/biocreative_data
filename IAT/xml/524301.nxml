In this study, we examined the primary structures and functional properties of RegB ribonucleases encoded by T4-related bacteriophages. We show that all but one of 36 phages tested harbor the <italic>regB</italic> gene homologues and the similar signals for transcriptional and post-transcriptional autogenous regulation of <italic>regB</italic> expression. Phage RB49 in addition to gpRegB utilizes <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> endoribonuclease E for the degradation of its transcripts for gene <italic>regB</italic>. The deduced primary structure of RegB proteins of 32 phages studied is almost identical to that of T4, while the sequences of RegB encoded by phages RB69, TuIa and RB49 show substantial divergence from their T4 counterpart. Functional studies using plasmid&#x02013;phage systems indicate that RegB nucleases of phages T4, RB69, TuIa and RB49 exhibit different activity towards GGAG and GGAU motifs in the specific locations. We expect that the availability of the different phylogenetic variants of RegB may help to localize the amino acid determinants that contribute to the specificity and cleavage efficiency of this processing enzyme.</p></abstract></article-meta><notes id="N0x94451d8.0x9981bf8" notes-type="data_link"><p>DDBJ&#x0002f;EMBL&#x0002f;GenBank accession nos<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> AJ439451, AJ490327, AJ496183, AJ488513&#x02013;AJ488527, AJ606889&#x02013;AJ606905</p></notes></front><body><sec><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>RNases play a central role in every aspect of T4 RNA metabolism, including decay of mRNA, conversion of RNA precursors to their mature forms and end-turnover of certain RNAs. Both host and phage endo- and exoribonucleases are involved in processing of phage transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh892c1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh892c3">3</xref>). A host cell contains a large number of distinct RNases approaching as many as 20 members, often with overlapping specificities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh892c4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh892c5">5</xref>). Eight distinct 3&#x02032; to 5&#x02032; exoribonucleases, polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase), RNase II, RNase D, RNase BN, RNase T, RNase PH, RNase R and oligoribonuclease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh892c5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh892c6">6</xref>), and at least five endoribonucleases, RNases III, E, G, P and I&#x0002f;M (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh892c6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh892c8">8</xref>) have been characterized in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. Among these ribonucleases, RNase E has the most prominent effect on the functional and chemical decay of many T4 mRNAs, and therefore it is considered the primary endoribonuclease for phage mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh892c9">9</xref>). The endoribonuclease E acts throughout all phage development, but in addition the T4 encodes its own endoribonuclease RegB, which participates in the turnover of early mRNAs of T4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh892c10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh892c14">14</xref>).</p><p>The RegB endoribonuclease encoded by phage T4 is a sequence-specific endoribonuclease, which cleaves mRNAs in the middle of sequence GGAG or, in a few cases, in the sequence GGAU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh892c10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh892c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh892c13">13</xref>). The most efficient cleavages occur in the motifs located in the intergenic regions of early T4 mRNAs. Out of 25 processing sites identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh892c13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh892c15">15</xref>), 12 occur in Shine&#x02013;Dalgarno (SD) sequences in such a way making ribosome-binding site non-functional. Primarily recognized examples were observed in the SD regions of the early genes <italic>motA</italic>, <italic>frd</italic> and <italic>comC</italic>&#x003b1; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh892c10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh892c12">12</xref>). This suggested the idea that RegB has a general role in the breakdown of T4 early mRNAs. Indeed, in the absence of RegB the chemical half-life of early transcripts of T4 is increased by &#x0223c;4-fold, though their functional half-life is increased slightly by &#x0003c;2-fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh892c14">14</xref>). RegB activity <italic>in vitro</italic> is very low but is enhanced by a factor up to 100 by the ribosomal protein S1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh892c16">16</xref>).</p><p>Not all GGAG sequences are cleaved equally. When located in a coding sequence, the tetranucleotide is poorly recognized or not at all. The GGAG motifs found in the SD regions of middle or late mRNAs are also generally resistant to RegB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh892c10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh892c14">14</xref>). This indicates that RegB recognizes not only the GGAG motif but also another signal. In the absence of clear sequence outside the GGAG, Lebars <italic>et al</italic>. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh892c17">17</xref>) proposed the RegB to recognize a structured conformation of the GGAG sequence that is presented or stabilized by the 30S ribosomal protein S1.</p><p>Gene <italic>regB</italic> is transcribed from a typical early promoter, immediately upstream of the gene. The expression of <italic>regB</italic> gene seems to be regulated autogenously by attacking its own mRNA within GGAG motif in the SD region and at three additional GGAG motifs within its coding sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh892c11">11</xref>). The availability of T4 <italic>regB</italic> deletion mutant reveals that the gene is non-essential under standard laboratory conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh892c11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh892c18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh892c19">19</xref>). However, PCR analysis showed the presence of gene <italic>regB</italic> in the genomes of four other T4-related phages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh892c20">20</xref>).</p><p>More than 150 bacteriophages with morphologies similar to T4 have been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh892c21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh892c22">22</xref>). Genomic hybridization and PCR analysis revealed that the T4-related phages vary considerably in their genomic organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh892c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh892c23">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh892c26">26</xref>). On the basis of the sequence comparison of the major structural genes, capsid gene (gene <italic>23</italic>), tail sheath gene (gene <italic>18</italic>) and tail tube gene (gene <italic>19</italic>), four subgroups of the T4-related phages have been distinguished: the T-evens, pseudo T-evens, schizo T-evens and exo T-evens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh892c26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh892c28">28</xref>). The term &#x02018;T4-related&#x02019; refers to all of them.</p><p>The vast majority of the known T4-related phages were isolated on enterobacteria, primarily <italic>E.coli</italic>, <italic>Shigella</italic> and <italic>Klebsiella</italic>, and most of them belong to the T-even subgroup. Among the T-even phages, the nucleotide sequences of homologous genes typically differ from each other by &#x0003c;5% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh892c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh892c24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh892c26">26</xref>). Due to their close relationship to T4, the T-even genomes can usually be analyzed and sequenced using PCR primers based on the T4 sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh892c20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh892c26">26</xref>). The members of the pseudo T-even subgroup are more diverse in their host range than the T-even phages, and their genomes are phylogenetically distant from T4. About 70% of the genome of the best-characterized pseudo T-even phage RB49 encodes protein homologues of T4 genes with the levels of amino acid identity ranging between 50% and 70% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh892c28">28</xref>). Among the various identified RB49 genes, those encoding structural proteins have the highest levels of homology to their T4 counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh892c25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh892c26">26</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we determined the <italic>regB</italic> sequences of 35 T4-related bacteriophages. We found that the <italic>regB</italic> gene of phages RB69, TuIa and RB49 diverged considerably from its T4 counterpart. Differences in the primary structure of rather a small protein with molecular mass of 18 kDa raised up a question if the endoribonuclease RegB of RB69, TuIa and RB49 retained the same unique specificity as the T4 RegB. Therefore, we examined the functional properties of RegB homologues encoded by these T4-related bacteriophages.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Bacterial and bacteriophage strains</title><p><italic>E.coli</italic> strain B<sup>E</sup> (<italic>sup</italic><sup>0</sup>) was a gift from Dr L.

It is the first description of the virus-encoded endoribonuclease that participates in the control of the expression of a number of phage early genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh892c10">10</xref>). This enzyme has almost absolute sequence specificity towards the GGAG tetranucleotides located in the SD regions of early mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh892c14">14</xref>). Finally, RegB has a unique primary structure that presents no homology to other proteins, in particular to the other known RNases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh892c35">35</xref>). The previous PCR analysis has shown the presence of <italic>regB</italic> homologues in the genomes of four T4-related phages, K3, RB70, T2 and T6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh892c20">20</xref>), but the nucleotide sequences have not been determined. In this work, we analyzed the conservation level of the gene <italic>regB</italic> in a wide group of T4 relatives. For this, we performed PCR and sequencing analysis of the genomic regions carrying gene <italic>regB</italic> of 36 T4-related phages.</p><p>A pair of primers based on the T4 gene <italic>regB</italic> sequence, Pr. 1&#x02013;Pr. 2, and a pair of primers flanking the T4 gene <italic>regB</italic>, Pr. 3&#x02013;Pr. 4, were used to amplify the analogues of gene <italic>regB</italic> of 36 T4-type phages. Using these primers, we obtained the PCR products of the expected sizes of 32 T4-related phages. The obtained PCR fragments were sequenced. The four phages, RB69, TuIa, RB42 and RB49, did not yield the PCR fragments with the primers used. A pair of primers based on the T4 gene <italic>vs.1</italic> sequence yielded PCR fragment of RB69, which was sequenced and shown to contain gene <italic>vs.1</italic> homologue. Additional primers were designed based on the newly obtained sequences of RB69 (see Materials and Methods). Using these primers, we were able to determine the sequence of gene <italic>regB</italic> of phages RB69 and TuIa. The sequence of gene <italic>vs.1</italic> of pseudo T-even phage RB49 was available in GenBank (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh892c31">31</xref>). Based on this sequence, we designed primer and sequenced the upstream region of <italic>vs.1</italic> of RB49. The RB49-specific primers were designed, and we defined the complete nucleotide sequence of gene <italic>regB</italic> of phage RB49. However, our attempts to obtain the sequence of gene <italic>regB</italic> of phage RB42 failed.</p><p>The sequences of the <italic>regB</italic> genes in 32 T4-related phages appeared to be very similar to each other. The deduced primary structures of RegB endoribonucleases of these phages were almost identical (98.6&#x02013;100%) to the T4 RegB (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh892f1">1</xref>). Based on PCR analysis of generally conserved regions, most of these phages have been previously classified as T-evens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh892c20">20</xref>). The phages RB69 and TuIa were also considered as the T-evens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh892c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh892c28">28</xref>), but the DNA hybridization studies and sequence analysis of some of the genes indicated these phages could occupy an &#x02018;intermediate&#x02019; position between T-even and pseudo T-even phages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh892c26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh892c36">36</xref>). The term &#x02018;mezzo T-evens&#x02019; has been proposed to describe such a class of &#x02018;intermediate&#x02019; T-even type phages (H. Krisch, personal communication). We also found that the RegB protein of RB69 and TuIa differed from the T4 RegB at a higher level that would be expected for T-evens: the primary structures of RegB endoribonucleases of phages TuIa and RB69 differed from the T4 RegB protein by 22.5%, but were identical to each other (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh892f1">1</xref>). The RegB of the pseudo T-even phage RB49 showed only 43.0% sequence identity with its T4 homologue and diverged mostly from the rest of the phages examined (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh892f1">1</xref>).</p><p>It should be noted that we could not detect the <italic>regB</italic> gene in the genome of pseudo T-even phage RB42. The open reading frame (ORF) that we had sequenced upstream of the gene <italic>vs.1</italic> of phage RB42 showed no homology to the T4 gene <italic>regB</italic>. Plasmid-induced transcripts carrying the GGAG motifs that were known to be well processed by T4 RegB were not cleaved after infection with RB42 (data not shown). This strongly suggested that the phage RB42 could lack the gene <italic>regB</italic> homologue. In support, it was recently shown that <italic>regB</italic> gene was also absent in the genome of phage KVP40, which is more distantly related to the T-evens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh892c37">37</xref>). The maintenance of <italic>regB</italic> gene in most of the closely related T4-like phages might have been associated with a requirement for gpRegB in certain natural conditions that are not shared by phages distantly related to the T4.</p></sec><sec><title>Transcriptional and post-transcriptional control of <italic>regB</italic> expression in T4-related bacteriophages</title><p>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh892f2">2</xref> shows the genes and the sites for transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation in the <italic>regB</italic> region of four T4-type phages. In T4, the transcript for gene <italic>regB</italic> is initiated from a typical early promoter, P<sub>E</sub>regB, immediately upstream the gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh892c11">11</xref>). We analyzed the nucleotide sequence of the 5&#x02032; flanking region of gene <italic>regB</italic> in 34 T4-related phages and found that all these phages possessed the promoter sequences immediately upstream the gene <italic>regB</italic>. The &#x02212;35 and &#x02212;10 promoter elements of P<sub>E</sub>regB of 32 T-even phages were identical to those of T4, and remarkably matched the T4 early promoter consensus elements &#x02212;35 GTTTAC(a&#x0002f;ttt) and &#x02212;10 TA(t&#x0002f;c)(a&#x0002f;t)AT spaced by 16&#x02013;17 bp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh892c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh892c38">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh892c41">41</xref>). The promoter sequences for gene <italic>regB</italic> of phages RB69 and TuIa also shared features of the T4 early promoters (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh892f3">3</xref>C). Thus, the regulation of <italic>regB</italic> transcription appeared to be similar in 34 phages tested.</p><p>In RB49 genome, no T4 consensus sequences of either early or middle mode promoters were found (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh892c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh892c31">31</xref>). Analysis of the transcription of several regions of the RB49 genome, such as the 5&#x02032; flanking regions of genes <italic>43</italic> and <italic>32</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh892c28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh892c31">31</xref>), revealed the early promoters of RB49 to contain the sequences matching <italic>E.coli</italic> &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup>-dependent promoter sequence &#x02212;35 cTTGACa and &#x02212;10 TATAAT spaced by 16&#x02013;18 bp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh892c42">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh892c45">45</xref>). However, we could not detect any typical promoter sequence just upstream the gene <italic>regB</italic>, while the primer extension analyses of <italic>regB</italic> transcripts showed a weak transcription start site for this gene (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh892f4">4</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh892f5">5</xref>B). According to this site, we deduced promoter, P<sub>E</sub>regB, which contained the &#x02212;35 sequence GTTTAAA and the &#x02212;10 sequence TACTGG spaced by 15 bp (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh892f5">5</xref>). Thus, P<sub>E</sub>regB slightly matched the &#x02212;35 element of T4 early promoters but had a poor &#x02212;10 element, and the spacing region between them was too short in comparison to the T4 early promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh892c2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh892c38">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh892c41">41</xref>). Nevertheless, the <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription experiments demonstrated that the <italic>E.coli</italic> RNA polymerase could recognize this sequence on the PCR-generated DNA fragment and initiate transcription at the same position as <italic>in vivo</italic> (data not shown). Primer extension analysis of RB49 <italic>regB</italic> transcription showed that the P<sub>E</sub>regB acted as a very weak promoter (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh892f4">4</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh892f5">5</xref>B), and <italic>regB</italic> appeared to be transcribed mostly into the polycistronic transcripts from the more distal promoter P<sub>E</sub>regB.1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh892f2">2</xref>), which had a typical <italic>E.coli</italic> &#x003c3;<sup>70</sup>-dependent promoter sequence and was much more effective (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh892f5">5</xref>).</p><p>A characteristic property of ribonucleases is the ability to autoregulate their synthesis in the cell. In <italic>E.coli</italic>, the genes for RNase III (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh892c46">46</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh892c48">48</xref>), RNase E (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh892c49">49</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh892c51">51</xref>), RNaseII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh892c52">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh892c53">53</xref>) and PNPase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh892c54">54</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh892c56">56</xref>) are known to be autoregulated or interregulated by controlling the degradation rate of their own mRNAs. Previous studies showed that the T4 endoribonuclease RegB efficiently cleaved its own mRNA within the GGAG motif located in the SD region and, less efficiently, the three additional GGAG motifs located in the coding sequence of the transcript for gene <italic>regB</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh892c11">11</xref>). Thirty-two T-evens analyzed in this study also carried the GGAG motif in the SD region and contained three or at least two GGAG motifs within the proximal part of the coding sequence of gene <italic>regB</italic>. Phages RB69 and TuIa contained the GGAG motif in the SD region and only one GGAG downstream from the initiation codon AUG (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh892f2">2</xref>). The SD region of RB49 gene <italic>regB</italic> contained a motif GGAU. In T4, only two exceptions were found where the RegB cleaved a GGAU sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh892c13">13</xref>). The coding sequence of RB49 <italic>regB</italic> mRNA lacked the putative RegB cleavage sites at the positions observed for T4, but had two GGAU motifs and the GGAG motif within the distal part of the coding sequence of <italic>regB</italic> transcript (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh892f2">2</xref>). Thus, autoregulation of expression seemed to be natural to the phages studied, although the concentration of the putative RegB target sites within the <italic>regB</italic> transcripts was different.</p><p>We tested the RegB nucleases of phages RB69, TuIa and RB49, that exhibited higher degree of divergence from T4, for their activity towards GGAG and GGAU motifs located in the SD regions and in the coding sequences of their <italic>regB</italic> transcripts. Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh892f3">3</xref>A and B shows the results of primer extension sequencing on RNAs extracted from the cells after infection with T4, RB69 and TuIa. Two 5&#x02032; truncated RNA termini were detected in every case. The first cut occurred within the SD sequence and the second one laid in the coding sequence downstream from AUG codon in the cases of RB69 and TuIa, as well as in T4.</p><p>Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh892f4">4</xref>A shows the primer extension sequencing and the kinetics of accumulation of RB49 <italic>regB</italic> mRNAs. The 5&#x02032; end of mRNA assigned to the transcription initiation appeared as soon as the first minute of infection, while the 5&#x02032; end of mRNA cleaved at the middle of the GGAU motif of the SD region was detected at the second minute of infection. Primer extension sequencing of the RB49 mRNAs for gene <italic>regB</italic> extracted from chloramphenicol-treated cells indicated that the cleavage was phage induced (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh892f5">5</xref>B). Thus, we can conclude that autoregulation of the expression at the post-transcriptional level is common to the <italic>regB</italic> of phages RB69, TuIa and RB49.</p><p>Two GGAU motifs as well as the GGAG located in the coding sequence of RB49 <italic>regB</italic> were resistant to RB49 RegB nucleolytic activity (data not shown). While seeking for the RegB-dependent cleavages in the coding sequence of the transcript for RB49 gene <italic>regB</italic>, the additional nucleolytic cut was observed within the distal part of the mRNA (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh892f4">4</xref>B). Primer extension analysis showed that the 5&#x02032; end of the truncated RB49 <italic>regB</italic> mRNA appeared at 3 min of infection and continued to accumulate onward. The 5&#x02032; end of truncated RNA was seen even when RB49 infection was carried out in the presence of chloramphenicol (data not shown) indicating that this endonucleolytic cleavage was caused by a host-encoded endoribonuclease. The sequence where the cut occurred matched the processing site for the <italic>E.coli</italic> RNase E (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh892c3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh892c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh892c57">57</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh892c60">60</xref>): the region was A&#x02013;U rich and three stable stem&#x02013;loops were supposed adjacent (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh892f4">4</xref>D).</p><p>To test whether the truncated mRNA could be the product of <italic>E.coli</italic> RNase E cleavage, total RNA was extracted from isogenic <italic>E.coli</italic> wild-type and <italic>rne</italic> (ts) strains after infection with phage RB49. The extracted mRNA was analyzed by primer extension sequencing. In the wild-type background, the truncated mRNA of RB49 <italic>regB</italic> was detected either in 30&#x000b0;C or in 43&#x000b0;C. In the <italic>rne</italic> (ts) background at 43&#x000b0;C, the 5&#x02032; ends of truncated mRNA were not observed, indicating that the 5&#x02032; ends were generated by RNase E-dependent cleavage and not by any other endonucleolytic event (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh892f4">4</xref>C). Therefore, we can conclude that the RegB of RB49 controls its biosynthesis by attacking its own mRNA within GGAU motif in the SD region, but in addition, the <italic>E.coli</italic> ribonuclease E is utilized for the degradation of <italic>regB</italic> transcripts of RB49. We looked for the RNase E processing sites in the <italic>regB</italic> transcripts of phages T4 and RB69, but the systematic primer extension analysis did not reveal RNase E-dependent cleavages.</p><p><italic>E.coli</italic> RNase E was originally implicated in processing of T4 transcripts for genes <italic>32</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh892c57">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh892c58">58</xref>) and &#x003b1;-<italic>gt</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh892c23">23</xref>). Furthermore, this ribonuclease was shown to have a major role in the degradation of many T4 messages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh892c9">9</xref>). The RNase E-dependent processing sites in the gene <italic>32</italic>-transcription unit was shown to be conserved in six T4-related phages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh892c23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh892c61">61</xref>). In spite of the sequence heterogeneity in this region, RNase E cleaved mRNAs for gene <italic>32</italic> of these phages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh892c23">23</xref>). However, in case of phage RB49 infection, unlike that of T4, the host RNase E was shown to have no major role in processing the gene <italic>32</italic>-transcription unit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh892c31">31</xref>). Therefore, we present perhaps the first clear evidence of the <italic>E.coli</italic> RNase E activity towards phage RB49 mRNAs.</p></sec><sec><title>Specificities of different RegB endoribonucleases</title><p>The RegB nuclease of bacteriophage T4 shows high specificity to the GGAG sequence but exhibits different activity <italic>in vivo</italic> towards different classes of mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh892c14">14</xref>). The GGAG-carrying RNAs that are uncut during T4 infection are also resistant to RegB in the two-plasmid systems <italic>in vitro</italic> indicating that the information identifying the substrate for RegB is carried in <italic>cis</italic> by RNA molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh892c14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh892c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh892c62">62</xref>). However, clear sequence motif outside GGAG distinguishing substrates and non-substrates of RegB has not been identified. It was shown that RegB preferentially cleaves GGAG motifs involved in a particular secondary structure, the formation of which is favored by the ribosomal protein S1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh892c17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh892c63">63</xref>).</p><p>However, little information is available in the literature concerning the protein determinants of RegB that contribute to the recognition specificity and cleavage activity of this enzyme. Examination of the T4 <italic>regB</italic> mutants constructed by a site-directed mutagenesis revealed the potent catalytic residues His-48 and His-68 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh892c35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh892c64">64</xref>). The Arg-52 was proposed to be important for the binding of the substrate RNA. The comparison of the primary structures of 35 RegB ribonucleases determined in this study showed that all these three residues were conserved between the 35 T4-related phages tested, except for RB49 RegB, where histidine H68 was changed to asparagine (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh892f1">1</xref>). Moreover, the RegB of the more distant T4 relatives had multiple variations in primary structure of the protein, and the sequence of RB49 RegB was shorter than the RegB of T4 by 13 amino acids. Therefore, we wondered if the RegB endoribonucleases encoded by distant T4-like phages retained the same functional properties as the T4 RegB.</p><p>As it was already mentioned, we found that the RegB endonucleases of RB69 and TuIa cleaved the GGAG motifs within the SD regions and in the coding sequences of their mRNAs for gene <italic>regB</italic>. The RegB of RB49 processed only the GGAU motif located within the ribosome-binding region of its <italic>regB</italic> mRNA but not the GGAU or GGAG motifs located within the coding region. In order to test the ability of RB49 RegB to cleave the GGAG motifs, we performed primer extension sequencing of RB49 transcripts for genes <italic>regB.1</italic> and <italic>vs.1</italic> (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh892f2">2</xref>), as well as for gene <italic>43</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="gkh892c31">31</xref>), that were known to carry GGAG motifs in their SD regions. The mRNA for gene <italic>regB.1</italic> was processed within SD sequence by ribonuclease RegB of RB49 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh892f5">5</xref>A), but the mRNAs of genes <italic>vs.1</italic> and <italic>43</italic> were resistant (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh892f5">5</xref>C and D). To ensure that the observed cuts in the SD sequences of genes <italic>regB.1</italic> and <italic>regB</italic> were caused by endoribonuclease RegB and not by <italic>E.coli</italic> endonucleolytic activity, the primer extension sequencing experiments were also carried on RNAs extracted from the cells after infection with RB49 in the presence of chloramphenicol. The 5&#x02032; end of truncated mRNA did not appear in both cases (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh892f5">5</xref>A and B) indicating that the activity was phage induced.</p><p>The noticeable selectivity against the GGAG and GGAU motifs observed for RB49 RegB might depend on the differences in the primary structure of this enzyme. To test this, we examined the capability of RegB of phages T4, RB69 and TuIa to cleave those GGAG-carrying mRNAs that were not cleaved by RB49 RegB. For this, we cloned the proximal part of gene <italic>vs.1</italic> of phage RB49 into an inducible plasmid pET21(&#x0002b;) and transformed <italic>E.coli</italic> C41(DE3) cells with the resulted plasmid p<sub>AZ</sub>RB49vs.1&#x02032;. The transcripts for the proximal part of RB49 gene <italic>vs.1</italic> were induced by addition of IPTG to the medium, and 15 min later, the cells were infected with one of the four phages. Total RNA was extracted, and the RegB cleavage sites were mapped by RNA sequencing of plasmid-induced transcripts. During T4, RB69 or TuIa infection, the RB49 <italic>vs.1</italic> transcript induced from plasmid was cleaved in the SD region, though the efficiency of T4 RegB cleavage was much lower than those of RB69 and TuIa (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh892f6">6</xref>A). As expected, the plasmid-induced RB49 <italic>vs.1</italic> transcript stayed resistant during infection of RB49. The RegB-dependent processing event was also not observed after infection with phage RB42 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh892f6">6</xref>A).</p><p>In the reverse experiment, we cloned the <italic>regB</italic> genes of phages T4, RB69 or RB49 into the inducible plasmid pET21(&#x0002b;). The RegB endoribonuclease was induced by addition of IPTG into the medium with <italic>E.coli</italic> cells carrying one of the recombinant plasmids with a cloned <italic>regB</italic> gene, and later the cells were infected with RB49. The total RNA was extracted and used for primer extension sequencing of gene <italic>vs.1</italic> and gene <italic>43</italic> mRNAs of RB49. The plasmid-induced RegB endoribonucleases of T4 and RB69 cleaved the transcripts for gene <italic>vs.1</italic> and gene <italic>43</italic> of RB49 at the GGAG motif present in their SD regions, while the RegB of RB49 had no effect on these mRNAs again (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh892f6">6</xref>B and C).</p><p>To test whether the RB49 RegB induced from the recombinant plasmid could process GGAG motifs located in the coding sequence of the T4 transcripts for gene <italic>regB</italic>, we used the <italic>E.coli</italic> C41(DE3) cells carrying the plasmid p<sub>LP</sub>RB49regB. For the control experiments, we also used <italic>E.coli</italic> C41(DE3) carrying the plasmid pET21(&#x0002b;) and <italic>E.coli</italic> C41(DE3) carrying the plasmids p<sub>LP</sub>T4regB or p<sub>LT</sub>RB69regB. The RegB endoribonucleases from the recombinant plasmids were induced by addition of IPTG. Later, the cells were infected with either bacteriophage T4 wild-type or the nuclease-deficient phage T4 <italic>regBL52</italic>. Total mRNA was extracted in each case of infection, and the cleavage sites were detected by primer extension sequencing. The results showed that the RB49 RegB could process the same motifs of the T4 <italic>regB</italic> transcripts as the T4 RegB but the efficiency of processing differed. The first and the third T4 RegB processing sites located in the coding sequence of <italic>regB</italic> transcript were more susceptible to the T4 or RB69 RegB ribonucleolytic attack in comparison to the second one (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh892f7">7</xref>A, C and D). Whereas, the RB49 RegB cleaved the second GGAG motif more efficiently than the SD, the first and the third ones (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="gkh892f7">7</xref>E).</p><p>Taken together, the results of these experiments clearly indicate that four homologous RegB endoribonucleases encoded by phages T4, RB69, TuIa and RB49 possess different capability to recognize GGAG&#x0002f;U motifs flanked by the same sequences. Some GGAG-carrying transcripts that are not cleaved by the RB49 RegB can be recognized and processed by the RegB of phages T4, RB69 or TuIa though with different efficiency. Different susceptibility of the same mRNAs to the RegB endoribonucleases of more distant T4 relatives could clearly be related to the differences in the primary structure of these proteins. It seems possible to propose that the highly diverged RegB of RB49 has more tight sequence requirements for the processing site. We expect the comparative studies of the structure&#x02013;function relationships between the RegB homologues may help to detect the specificity determinants carried by the RegB protein.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="display-objects"><title>Figures and Tables</title><fig id="gkh892f1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p> Amino acid sequence alignment of RegB endoribonucleases of T4-related phages.
