One class of such RNAs, natural antisense transcripts (NATs), are derived from the opposite strand of many protein-coding genes. Although the exact structure and functional relevance of most of the NATs is unknown, their emerging role as gene expression regulators raises the hypothesis that NATs might contribute to development of complex human disorders. The goal of our study was to investigate the involvement of NATs in regulation of candidate genes for blood pressure.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>First we analysed blood pressure candidate genes for the presence of natural antisense transcripts. <italic>In silico </italic>analysis revealed that seven genes (<italic>ADD3</italic>, <italic>NPPA</italic>, <italic>ATP1A1</italic>, <italic>NPR2</italic>, <italic>CYP17A1</italic>, <italic>ACSM3</italic>, <italic>SLC14A2</italic>) have an antisense partner transcribed from the opposite strand. We characterized <italic>NPPA </italic>and its antisense transcript (<italic>NPPA-AS</italic>) in more detail. We found that <italic>NPPA-AS </italic>is expressed in a number of human tissues as a collection of alternatively spliced isoforms and that <italic>NPPA-AS </italic>and <italic>NPPA </italic>can form RNA duplexes <italic>in vivo</italic>. We also demonstrated that a specific <italic>NPPA-AS </italic>isoform is capable of down-regulating the intron-retained <italic>NPPA </italic>mRNA variant. We studied the evolutionary conservation of <italic>NPPA-AS </italic>and were able to detect the presence of <italic>Nppa-as </italic>transcript in mouse.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Our results demonstrate functional interaction of <italic>NPPA-AS </italic>with <italic>NPPA </italic>at the RNA level and suggest that antisense transcription might be an important post-transcriptional mechanism modulating <italic>NPPA </italic>expression.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>A number of large-scale transcriptional mapping studies have shown that the mammalian transcriptome is extremely complex not only due to alternative splicing but also (and maybe primarily) because of the abundance of noncoding and often overlapping transcriptional units [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. This has raised the hypothesis of RNA-based regulatory system that has allowed the elaboration and expansion of phenotypic complexity of multicellular organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. It appears that the transcription from both strands in eukaryotic genomes is widespread [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], resulting in a large pool of complementary RNAs, or natural sense-antisense transcript pairs. The diversity and extent of antisense transcription suggests that this may be an important and common mechanism of gene expression modulation (recently reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]).</p><p>Depending on the methodological approach and criteria for antisense transcript detection, the estimates of the proportion of transcripts involved in formation of sense-antisense pairs varies from 20 to 40% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Majority of the natural antisense transcripts (NATs) originate from the opposite DNA strand of the same locus as the sense transcript (cis-NATs). In some cases, NATs can be transcribed from different loci on the genome (trans-NATs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Although high-throughput studies have investigated expression pattern and evolution of antisense transcripts on a genome-wide scale, the direct regulatory role of NATs has been demonstrated only in a few cases. The mode of NAT action includes very different mechanisms like transcriptional interference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], RNA masking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], and epigenetic silencing by triggering heterochromatin formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. In addition, other double-stranded RNA dependant mechanisms like RNA editing or RNA interference may be involved. It has been shown that bidirectionally transcribed loci in mouse can produce endogenous siRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and therefore may regulate gene expression by means of RNAi. In the case of <italic>Zeb2 </italic>(zinc finger E-box binding homeobox 2) expression regulation, a NAT masks one of the 5' splice sites of <italic>Zeb2 </italic>pre-mRNA, thereby causing the retention of regulatory intron that is necessary for the translation of Zeb2 protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Strong phenotypic effect of antisense transcription was shown in a specific case of thalassemia which is caused by a deletion leading to aberrant antisense transcription and silencing of a neighboring gene by CpG island methylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The potential role of NATs in the regulation of gene expression raises the hypothesis that they might contribute to complex genetic human disorders such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes or mental disorders.</p><p>The goal of the present study was to investigate whether natural antisense transcripts are involved in regulation of candidate genes for hypertension. We proposed that the functional variation of candidate genes might be affected by the interaction with regulatory factors, including non-coding antisense RNAs. We focused on the genes with demonstrated role in familial forms of hypo- and hypertension from a salt-water homeostasis pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>We identified seven genes that are associated with cis-NATs (<italic>ADD3</italic>, <italic>NPPA</italic>, <italic>ATP1A1</italic>, <italic>NPR2</italic>, <italic>CYP17A1</italic>, <italic>ACSM3</italic>, <italic>SLC14A2</italic>). Detailed analysis was carried out for <italic>NPPA </italic>(natriuretic peptide precursor A) and its natural antisense transcript, <italic>NPPA-AS</italic>. <italic>NPPA </italic>codes for a precursor of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) that protects the cardiovascular system from the volume and pressure overload by decreasing vascular smooth muscle tone. Common genetic variants at the <italic>NPPA </italic>locus that are associated with the higher ANP concentration are also associated with lower blood pressure and reduced risk of hypertension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. In addition, <italic>NPPA </italic>expression is tightly regulated during the embryonic heart development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], suggesting that complex regulatory mechanisms control the activity of <italic>NPPA</italic>.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>Natural antisense transcripts associated with candidate genes for blood pressure regulation</title><p>We first identified candidate genes [see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref> &#x02013; Table S1] with the evidence of antisense transcription by screening them against published sense-antisense pairs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] and scanning for expressed sequence tags (ESTs) on opposite strand using UCSC Genome Browser <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/"/>. We found that seven (<italic>ADD3</italic>, <italic>NPPA</italic>, <italic>ATP1A1</italic>, <italic>NPR2</italic>, <italic>CYP17A1</italic>, <italic>ACSM3</italic>, <italic>SLC14A2</italic>) out of 38 genes tested had multiexon NATs supported by a number of ESTs with canonical GT-AG splice donor-acceptor sites (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). The antisense transcripts (indicated by suffix -<italic>AS</italic>, that stands for 'antisense') differ from each other in their organization and complementarity in respect to sense mRNA [see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref> &#x02013; Figure S1]. The 5'-most exons of antisense transcript for adducin 3, <italic>ADD3-AS</italic>, have complementarity to 5' UTR exons of the sense gene (5'-5' overlap). In other cases, the overlap pattern is more complex, involving one or several internal exons and intron-exon boundaries. In two cases, the transcript from opposite strand has been annotated as a protein-coding mRNA: (i) <italic>NPR2 </italic>3'-most exon is partially complementary to <italic>SPAG8 </italic>[see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref> &#x02013; Figure S1D] and (ii) <italic>EXOD1 </italic>is transcribed from opposite strand of <italic>ACSM3 </italic>[see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref> &#x02013; Figure S1F]. In addition, the open reading frame (ORF) is predicted for one of the isoforms of <italic>ADD3-AS </italic>and <italic>NPPA-AS </italic>(99 and 121 amino acids, respectively). Taken together, these data indicate that antisense transcripts associated with blood pressure candidate genes have diverse structure and various relationships to their sense partners.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Hypertension candidate genes associated with antisense transcripts.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left"><bold>Gene</bold></td><td align="left"><bold>Antisense overlap*</bold></td><td align="left"><bold>Antisense mRNA/ESTs&#x000a7;</bold></td><td align="left"><bold>Antisense ORF</bold></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left"><bold><italic>ADD3</italic></bold>(adducin 3)<break/>chr10:111,746,098-111,885,313</td><td align="left">2 exons, both 5' UTR</td><td align="left">U92992 (total 17 ESTs)</td><td align="left">3 exons, 99 aa</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold><italic>NPPA </italic></bold>(natriuretic peptide precursor A)<break/>chr1:11,828,363-11,830,422</td><td align="left">3 exons</td><td align="left">BU732528 (total 12 ESTs)</td><td align="left">1 exon, 121 aa</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold><italic>ATP1A1 </italic></bold>(Na+/K+ -ATPase alpha 1 subunit)<break/>chr1:116,717,359-116,748,919</td><td align="left">3 coding exons</td><td align="left">AK309389 (total 27 ESTs)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold><italic>NPR2 </italic></bold>(natriuretic peptide receptor B)<break/>chr9:35,782,406-35,799,728</td><td align="left">1 exon (coding and 3' UTR)</td><td align="left"><italic>SPAG8 </italic>(total 37 ESTs)</td><td align="left">8 exons, 501 aa</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold><italic>CYP17A1 </italic></bold>(cytochrome P450, family 17)<break/>chr10:104,580,278-104,587,280</td><td align="left">3 coding exons</td><td align="left">BX100578 (total 6 ESTs)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold><italic>ACSM3 </italic></bold>(acyl-coenzyme A synthetase)<break/>chr16:20,682,813-20,715,980</td><td align="left">1 coding exon</td><td align="left"><italic>EXOD1 </italic>(total 49 ESTs)</td><td align="left">11 exons, 328 aa</td></tr><tr><td align="left"><bold><italic>SLC14A2 </italic></bold>(solute carrier family 14, member 2)<break/>chr18:41,046,958-41,517,058</td><td align="left">1 noncoding 5' UTR exon</td><td align="left">AK126075 (total 12 ESTs)</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>* Number of sense gene exons involved in sense-antisense complementarity. &#x000a7; A gene symbol or a GenBank accession of a representative EST or mRNA and a total number of ESTs in antisense cluster.

The band corresponds to the expected size of 405 bp.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2199-10-81-1"/></fig><p>We investigated the expression of <italic>NPPA </italic>using commercial Human Multiple Tissue cDNA panels MTC I and II (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B, C</xref>). Consistent with previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], the strongest expression of <italic>NPPA </italic>was detected in heart, but several tissues contained additional alternative products. Sequencing of these products revealed that the largest <italic>NPPA </italic>band detected in many tissues (1820 bp) represents the isoform of <italic>NPPA </italic>with retained both introns (further referred to as <italic>NPPA+Intr1+2</italic>). Visual inspection of the agarose gel (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>) indicates that the expression of this unspliced form and correctly spliced <italic>NPPA </italic>appear to be inversely correlated. Alternative product of 722 bp that was observed in liver, testis and leukocytes contains the retained intron 1 (<italic>NPPA+Intr1</italic>). In addition, a product shorter than correctly spliced <italic>NPPA </italic>mRNA (457 bp) was detected in testis. Sequencing of this product revealed that its sequence and splicing pattern are similar to the transcripts originating from the opposite strand, suggesting that this is actually an isoform of <italic>NPPA-AS</italic>, which was not represented by any of the ESTs in the database. To ensure that the amplification of <italic>NPPA+Intr1+2 </italic>is not caused by genomic DNA contamination, additional PCR experiments were performed with several primers that detect only <italic>NPPA-AS</italic>, but not <italic>NPPA </italic>[see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref> &#x02013; Figure S2]. Because <italic>NPPA </italic>and <italic>NPPA-AS </italic>are both transcribed from the same genomic locus, contamination with the genomic DNA should result in amplification of unspliced <italic>NPPA-AS </italic>as well. However, these reactions yielded only the products corresponding to correctly spliced <italic>NPPA-AS</italic>, indicating no presence of the genomic contamination and demonstrating that the <italic>NPPA+Intr1+2 </italic>isoform indeed represents mRNA with retained introns.</p></sec><sec><title><italic>NPPA-AS </italic>is expressed as a collection of alternatively spliced isoforms</title><p>Next, we characterized the structure and expression profile of <italic>NPPA-AS </italic>in human tissues using the panel of tissue-specific cDNAs (Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C, D</xref>). Sequencing of eight identified isoforms confirmed that they all are spliced according to GT-AG consensus rule [see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref> &#x02013; Figures S3 and S4]. It appears that <italic>NPPA-AS </italic>isoforms are not a result of alternative usage of different exons, but rather almost every exon displays at least two alternative splice donor/acceptor sites (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). Majority of the alternative splicing events occur at the acceptor site of the intron. In addition, clearly identifiable polypyrimidine tract is located close to the splice acceptor site of all introns.</p><p>Next, we mapped the 3' end of <italic>NPPA-AS </italic>by RACE using RNA from HeLa cell line. We designed the gene-specific primers that would identify the 3' variants that are important in respect of complementarity with <italic>NPPA</italic>. Sequencing of the 3' RACE products identified two alternative 3' ends of <italic>NPPA-AS</italic>. One of the RACE products confirmed the presence of 3'-terminal exon that was predicted based on EST sequences CD368210 and BU732528 (3'RACE.1, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). In addition, we identified a novel 3'-terminal exon that overlaps with the second intron and third exon of <italic>NPPA </italic>(3'RACE.2, Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). Expression analysis of the 3'RACE.2 isoform showed that among the sixteen tissues analysed, it is expressed only in testis (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). Isoform 3'RACE.1 contains a suboptimal AGTAAA poly(A) signal 16 nucleotides upstream of the cleavage site, in the position where the majority of poly(A) signals are located [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. 3'RACE.2 isoform does not contain a detectable polyadenylation signal, but an A-rich element (AAAGAGAACACAGACATA), similar to the element found in <italic>PAPOLG </italic>gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], that is also lacking any poly(A) signal variant, is located 19 nucleotides upstream of polyadenylation site. This suggests that in addition to alternative splicing, the processing of the <italic>NPPA-AS </italic>transcript might be regulated also at the level of polyadenylation.</p></sec><sec><title>Primary sequence of <italic>NPPA-AS </italic>is not evolutionarily conserved</title><p>To address the evolutionary conservation of <italic>NPPA-AS</italic>, we first asked whether <italic>Nppa </italic>gene in mouse is associated with similar natural antisense transcript. Two ESTs (GenBank:<ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="BQ771223">BQ771223</ext-link> and <ext-link ext-link-type="gen" xlink:href="CO043998">CO043998</ext-link> representing the 5' and 3' end of the IMAGE clone 6400656) at the <italic>Nppa </italic>locus originate from the opposite strand and therefore may represent <italic>Nppa-as </italic>in mouse. These ESTs are isolated from the brain of the mouse at embryonic day 12.5. Both ESTs follow the GT-AG splicing consensus, and CO043998 contains a canonical polyadenylation signal AATAAA as well as a short poly(A) tail. RT-PCR using RNA isolated from mouse tissues showed weak expression of <italic>Nppa-as </italic>in brain and very faint signal in liver (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>), while the expression of <italic>Nppa </italic>was present in all tissues that were tested (heart, brain, lung, liver, kidney and spleen) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). Exons of the mouse and human antisense transcript are not conserved at the primary structure level outside of the overlap regions with the <italic>NPPA </italic>exons and are located at the different positions in the genomic sequence (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>). However, both in mouse and in human, the antisense transcript overlaps with the intron-exon boundaries of <italic>NPPA </italic>gene (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Expression analysis of <italic>Nppa </italic>and <italic>Nppa-as </italic>in mouse tissues</bold>.

Because of the variety of functional mechanisms and lack of direct experimental support, the biological meaning of most of this noncoding transcription is still unclear. In the present study we have investigated <italic>NPPA/NPPA-AS </italic>sense-antisense transcript pair.</p><p>Several studies have addressed the question whether some fraction of antisense transcripts may in fact be artifacts of reverse transcription reaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. To exclude such artifacts from our study, we considered only NATs with two or more exons and consensus splice sequences. In addition, 3' RACE reactions further confirmed the strand-specificity of <italic>NPPA-AS </italic>by identification of two alternative polyadenylated 3' terminal exons (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>).</p><p><italic>NPPA </italic>is a functional candidate gene for elevated blood pressure, coding for an atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), a member of a small family of endogenous peptide hormones. It is produced primarily by atrial cardiocytes in response to increasing cardiac wall tension. Association of specific <italic>NPPA </italic>variants with increased ANP levels as well as with lower blood pressure and reduced risk of hypertension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] strongly support the central role of <italic>NPPA </italic>in the maintenance of blood pressure homeostasis. In addition, a region harbouring <italic>NPPA </italic>was among the eight loci identified in the meta-analysis of blood pressure genome-wide association studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Transcriptional regulation of <italic>NPPA </italic>and maturation of ANP have been studied quite extensively (for recent reviews see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]) and our results add further evidence to the elaborate control of <italic>NPPA </italic>expression.</p><p>During the expression analysis of <italic>NPPA </italic>mRNA we found the strongest expression of correctly spliced <italic>NPPA </italic>in heart and moderate expression in a number of human tissues, including prostate, pancreas and small intestine, for example (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). In addition, we observed the expression of <italic>NPPA </italic>isoforms with retained introns (<italic>NPPA+Intr1 </italic>and <italic>NPPA+Intr1+2</italic>) in several tissues (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1B</xref>). Normally, ANP is synthesized as a 153-amino acid preprohormone. Removal of the signal peptide creates a 126-amino acid prohormone that is further cleaved to form a mature C-terminal 27-amino acid ANP. In the case of <italic>NPPA+Intr1 </italic>and <italic>NPPA+Intr1+2</italic>, the ORF that starts with the first methionine (Met-1) of prepro-ANP encodes only for a signal peptide region and is terminated after the frameshift caused by the intron retention. An alternative ORF of intron-retained <italic>NPPA </italic>isoforms, starting with the methionine Met-51 includes the mature ANP sequence, but since the peptide encoded by this putative ORF does not contain a signal sequence, its proper processing and biological activity is doubtful.</p><p>The natural antisense transcript of <italic>NPPA</italic>, that we named <italic>NPPA-AS</italic>, is widely present in human tissues and displays a complex pattern of alternative splicing (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1D</xref>). All different <italic>NPPA-AS </italic>splicing isoforms overlap with both exonic and intronic regions of <italic>NPPA</italic>, including intron-exon boundaries (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1C</xref>). Such overlap pattern raised the hypothesis that <italic>NPPA-AS </italic>may be involved in the regulation of <italic>NPPA </italic>expression.</p><p>Overlapping antisense gene pairs are preferentially co-expressed or inversely expressed in human tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], supporting a model of negative control by antisense RNA that proposes state of balance in case of co-expression or up- or downregulation in case of inverse expression. Interestingly, the expression of <italic>NPPA-AS </italic>was strongly correlated with the intron-retained, rather than correctly spliced form of <italic>NPPA </italic>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>), indicating that it may play a functional role in posttranscriptional regulation of <italic>NPPA </italic>expression. Such correlation, however, does not necessarily indicate causal relationship, because it can be affected by many factors including regulation of transcription of both <italic>NPPA </italic>and <italic>NPPA-AS</italic>, or modulation of <italic>NPPA </italic>splicing by other factors.</p><p>Conservation often reflects functional significance of a nucleotide sequence. Among sense-antisense pairs, less than 7% are found to be conserved between human and mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. This may indicate that antisense transcripts are mostly species-specific, or alternatively, that the process of transcription, secondary structure or organization of the transcript rather than the primary sequence is functionally important. Among conserved sense-antisense pairs, about one third have identical expression pattern in mouse and human [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. We found that expression profile in mouse and human is different for both <italic>NPPA </italic>and <italic>NPPA-AS </italic>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). In mouse, <italic>Nppa </italic>is strongly expressed in some tissues (brain, lung, liver) where human <italic>NPPA </italic>is expressed weakly. We did not detect any alternatively spliced or intron-retained <italic>Nppa </italic>forms in mouse. In case of <italic>NPPA-AS</italic>, we found that neither the primary structure nor the expression pattern is conserved between mouse and human: in human it is expressed in all tissues examined, while in mouse the expression was observed only in brain (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2A</xref>). However, both mouse and human antisense transcripts overlap with the exon-intron boundaries of <italic>NPPA </italic>(Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2B</xref>), implying that such genomic arrangement might be functionally significant.</p><p>Although many antisense transcripts overlap with the intron-exon boundaries of the sense mRNA, the effect of endogenous antisense transcripts as splicing regulators is studied in detail only in a few cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Modulation of mRNA splicing by exogenous antisense oligonucleotides has gained more attention and its therapeutic potential has been established in clinical trials involving patients with Duchenne's muscular dystrophy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Much less is known about the role of endogenous antisense RNAs in regulation of splicing or stability of different mRNA isoforms. The complementarity of <italic>NPPA </italic>and its antisense exons suggests that if <italic>NPPA-AS </italic>has a function in regulation of <italic>NPPA</italic>, it depends on the mechanisms that involve the interactions at the RNA level. Our results show (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4B</xref>) that at least one <italic>NPPA-AS </italic>isoform can modulate the ratio of unspliced and spliced <italic>NPPA </italic>variants, by decreasing the levels of intron-retained <italic>NPPA </italic>form. Since we were using minigene expression system, we excluded the effects of such possible regulatory mechanisms like transcriptional interference and heterochromatin formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Currently we do not know what is the exact mechanism of intron-retained <italic>NPPA </italic>downregulation, but it is possible that the formation of the duplex RNA due to the complementary regions can lead to post-transcriptional regulation via different mechanisms like RNA masking (in which case the binding of factors required for splicing or export is blocked), RNA editing or RNA interference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Although the role of RNA interference in NAT-mediated regulation in mammals has been controversial, Watanabe <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] identified seventeen loci in mouse where siRNAs arose from interaction of sense-antisense transcripts of the same locus. Considering the large number of NATs in mammals, the real extent of siRNA biogenesis via endogenous sense-antisense RNA interaction in mammalian cells remains still unknown. It is also possible that since antisense transcription extends through entire <italic>NPPA </italic>locus and into the promoter region, the mechanisms like transcriptional interference and modulation of <italic>NPPA </italic>promoter elements can occur and affect the expression of <italic>NPPA </italic>independently.</p><p>Although the biological role of <italic>NPPA </italic>antisense transcription needs further investigation, the regulatory role of <italic>NPPA </italic>in both adult cardiovascular system and in heart development during embryogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] suggest that <italic>NPPA-AS </italic>may be involved in fine-tuning of <italic>NPPA </italic>expression during embryonic development or in response to specific stimulus.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have identified the natural antisense transcripts of human blood pressure candidate genes and provide a detailed characterization of an antisense transcript associated with the <italic>NPPA </italic>gene.

During optimization, serial dilutions of template were used and the specificity of the PCR products was confirmed by the presence of a single peak during the dissociation curve analysis. Amplification efficiency of the reactions was 100 &#x000b1; 10% and intra- and inter-assay variation coefficients were below 3% and 8%, respectively. PCR efficiencies were calculated from ten-fold dilution series and relative expression of correctly spliced and intron-retained <italic>NPPA </italic>was calculated according to Pfaffl [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] by taking PCR efficiency into account. The geometric mean of <italic>GAPDH </italic>and <italic>HPRT1 </italic>was used as an endogenous control. Statistical significance of the results was analyzed using two-tailed Mann-Whitney test.</p></sec><sec><title>Duplex detection</title><p>RNA from NIH3T3 cells cotransfected with constructs pNPPAmg2 and pNPPA-AS-1 or pNPPA-AS-3 was isolated as described previously and treated with DNase (TURBO DNA-free Kit&#x02122;, Ambion) according to manufacturer's instructions and 0.5 &#x003bc;l of RNase A (10 mg/ml, Fermentas). RNase was inactivated with 0.5 mg/ml proteinase K treatment at the presence of 1% SDS for 30 min at 37&#x000b0;C. RNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform treatment and cDNA was synthesized using primers In1R (for NPPA-AS-1 duplex detection) or duplR (for NPPA-AS-3) and First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Fermentas). In parallel, control experiments using RNAs not treated with RNase A and reverse transcriptions without reverse transcriptase were performed. PCR was performed with primers In1R and Ex1In1F for detection of <italic>NPPA:</italic>:<italic>NPPA-AS-1 </italic>duplex and with primers duplF and duplR for detection of <italic>NPPA:</italic>:<italic>NPPA-AS-3 </italic>duplex.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>TA and ML designed the study, KK and ML selected and analysed the candidate genes, TA performed the experiments and carried out the analyses, TA and ML wrote the paper.
