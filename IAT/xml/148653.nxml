One way in which the phage escaped from being killed by RNase III cleavage was to incorporate uncoded A residues on either side of the stem. This oligo(A) stretch interrupts the perfect stem that forms the RNase III site and thus confers resistance. In this paper we have analyzed the origin of these uncoded adenosines. The data strongly suggest that they are added by the host enzyme poly(A) polymerase. Apparently the 3'-OH created by RNase III cleavage becomes a substrate for poly(A) polymerase. Subsequently, MS2 replicase makes one contiguous copy from the two parts of the genome RNA. The evolutionary conversion from RNase III sensitivity to resistance provides a large spectrum of solutions that could be an important tool to understand what essentially constitutes an RNase III site in vivo.</p></abstract></article-meta></front></article>
