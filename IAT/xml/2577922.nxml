Cohesion along the arms of meiotic sister chromatids provides an evolutionarily conserved mechanism to keep recombinant chromosomes associated until anaphase I. One attractive hypothesis to explain age-dependent nondisjunction (NDJ) is that loss of cohesion over time causes recombinant homologues to dissociate prematurely and segregate randomly during the first meiotic division. Using Drosophila as a model system, we have tested this hypothesis and observe a significant increase in meiosis I NDJ in experimentally aged Drosophila oocytes when the cohesin protein SMC1 is reduced. Our finding that missegregation of recombinant homologues increases with age supports the model that chiasmata are destabilized by gradual loss of cohesion over time. Moreover, the stage at which Drosophila oocytes are most vulnerable to age-related defects is analogous to that at which human oocytes remain arrested for decades. Our data provide the first demonstration in any organism that, when meiotic cohesion begins intact, the aging process can weaken it sufficiently and cause missegregation of recombinant chromosomes. One major advantage of these studies is that we have reduced but not eliminated the SMC1 subunit. Therefore, we have been able to investigate how aging affects normal meiotic cohesion. Our findings that recombinant chromosomes are at highest risk for loss of chiasmata during diplotene argue that human oocytes are most vulnerable to age-induced loss of meiotic cohesion at the stage at which they remain arrested for several years.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>In humans, chromosome segregation errors during meiosis are the leading cause of birth defects and miscarriages. Moreover, as women age, these errors increase dramatically. For accurate segregation during the first meiotic division, homologous chromosomes must remain physically associated until anaphase I. Normally, attachments along the arms of sister chromatids keep the recombinant homologues together. Human oocytes complete meiotic recombination during fetal development and arrest until ovulation. Therefore, accurate segregation of homologous chromosomes during the first meiotic division requires that recombinant chromosomes remain associated for decades. One hypothesis to explain why segregation errors increase as women age is that the connections between sister chromatids deteriorate over time and allow recombinant homologues to dissociate prematurely. Here, we address this hypothesis using Drosophila as a model system. We find that when Drosophila oocytes undergo experimentally induced aging, recombinant homologues missegregate during meiosis I. Furthermore, the meiotic stage at which Drosophila oocytes are most vulnerable to age-induced errors is analogous to the stage at which human oocytes remain arrested for decades. Together, our data argue that aging does cause premature loss of the connections between meiotic chromosomes and that this is a major determinant of segregation errors in both Drosophila and human oocytes.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>In humans, meiotic chromosome segregation errors that give rise to aneuploid gametes are the leading cause of fetal loss and birth defects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000263-Hassold1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>.

Meiotic cohesion is represented by solid black circles linking the sister chromatids. Centromeres are depicted as white bi-lobed structures. Sister chromatid cohesion distal to the site of a crossover is necessary to hold recombinant homologues together and this linkage ensures their accurate segregation during meiosis I. During meiotic prophase I, cohesion-dependent association of recombinant homologues is manifest as chiasmata that occur at crossover sites. Because meiotic recombination in human oocytes occurs during fetal development and is followed by a prolonged dictyate arrest, chiasma maintenance requires that sister cohesion remain intact for decades. One explanation for why meiotic segregation errors are more prevalent in older women is that cohesion between sister chromatids deteriorates with age and renders recombinant chromosomes susceptible to missegregation.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="pgen.1000263.g001"/></fig><p>Given that human oocytes undergo meiotic recombination during fetal development and remain suspended in a prolonged dictyate (diplotene) arrest until ovulation, the continuous association of homologous chromosomes demands that meiotic sister-chromatid cohesion remain intact for decades. One attractive hypothesis to explain age-dependent NDJ is that deterioration of cohesion with age causes recombinant homologues to dissociate prematurely and segregate randomly during the first meiotic division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000263-g001">Figure 1</xref>). However, testing this hypothesis in humans presents several insurmountable challenges.</p><p>Using Drosophila as a model system, we have developed an experimental regimen to study the mechanisms that contribute to increased levels of meiotic NDJ in oocytes as a result of aging <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000263-Jeffreys1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. The Drosophila ovary is composed of several ovarioles, each of which contains a linear array of oocytes at progressive stages of development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000263-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Throughout the lifetime of the female, germline stem cells at the tip of each ovariole continuously generate a steady stream of newly formed oocytes that enter meiotic prophase and grow and develop as they move posteriorly; as mature oocytes pass through the oviduct they complete meiosis and are fertilized. Under normal conditions (continuous egg laying), Drosophila oogenesis is an uninterrupted process with only a brief arrest at metaphase I before ovulation. However, when egg laying is suppressed, the majority of Drosophila oocytes within each ovariole are halted in developmental progression and &#x0201c;age&#x0201d; within the abdomen of the female (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000263-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Such experimentally induced aging of Drosophila oocytes can be used to mimic the normal aging process that human oocytes undergo within the ovary during a female's lifespan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000263-Jeffreys1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>. We have used this aging regimen to test the hypothesis that meiotic cohesion deteriorates as the oocyte ages and increases the frequency at which recombinant homologues missegregate. Although maternal age does not dictate the age of the oocyte in fruit flies as it does in humans, for simplicity we will refer to increased NDJ in experimentally aged Drosophila oocytes as &#x0201c;age-dependent NDJ.&#x0201d;</p><fig id="pgen-1000263-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1000263.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Scheme for aging Drosophila oocytes and measuring nondisjunction.</title><p>(A) Each Drosophila ovary is composed of several ovarioles that contain a linear array of oocytes at progressive stages of development.

(B) For the aging regimen, virgin females of the same genotype are divided into two groups. Control females (left) are incubated with males and lay eggs continuously. Experimental females (right) are deprived of males and egg-laying is suppressed. In these females, developmental progression of oogenesis is halted and oocytes &#x0201c;age&#x0201d; within the female. After four days of this aging regimen, control and experimental females are placed in vials with males and the flies are transferred at 24-hour intervals to generate &#x0201c;24 hour broods&#x0201d; of progeny for NDJ analysis. Each brood corresponds to oocytes that were halted at specific stages of development during the aging regimen (see panel A). Meiotic NDJ is measured in all three broods of both aged and non-aged oocytes (see below). (C) To measure NDJ, we made use of an <italic>X</italic> chromosome dominant marker, <italic>Bar</italic> (<italic>B<sup>&#x02212;</sup></italic>), that affects eye shape. <italic>Bar<sup>&#x0002b;</sup></italic> experimental females are crossed to <italic>Bar<sup>&#x02212;</sup></italic> males that contain an attached <italic>X&#x02227;Y</italic> chromosome.

If meiotic segregation is normal in the female, oocytes will be produced that contain one <italic>X</italic> chromosome. However, segregation errors during female meiosis will result in exceptional gametes that contain either two <italic>X</italic> chromosomes (Diplo) or no <italic>X</italic> chromosomes (Nullo).

Stage 14 oocytes remain arrested at metaphase I until passage through the oviduct triggers resumption of the meiotic divisions.

When pachytene oocytes undergo the aging regimen, recombinant chromosomes do not exhibit an age-dependent increase in nondisjunction (sub-broods 5 and 6). In contrast, sub-broods 3 and 4, which display the greatest age-related defects, are composed primarily of oocytes at stages 7 and 8 of oocyte development.

Of special note is the finding that recombinant chromosomes are most susceptible to segregation errors if Drosophila oocytes undergo aging during diplotene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000263-g008">Figure 8</xref>) because this is the meiotic stage at which human oocytes remain arrested for decades.</p><p>Our sub-brood analysis also suggests that non-recombinant chromosomes in <italic>smc1<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup> mtrm<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> oocytes missegregate more frequently when aging is induced in oocytes prior to metaphase I (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000263.s002">Figure S2</xref>), although the difference between sub-brood 1 and the other sub-broods is not statistically significant (0.10&#x0003c;<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.27).

In contrast, low levels of MII NDJ indicate that centromeric cohesion remains intact, at least for the duration of our aging regimen. Recombinant chromosomes in Drosophila oocytes that undergo aging after they have disassembled their synaptonemal complex (diplotene-like) are most vulnerable to age effects and these oocytes bear a striking resemblance to the stage at which human oocytes remain arrested for decades. Interestingly, Drosophila oocytes that are subjected to aging during pachytene do not exhibit significant age-dependent nondisjunction.

Therefore, we speculate that the synaptonemal complex may play a role in protecting sister-chromatid cohesion from age-induced deterioration. The differential response of pachytene and diplotene-like Drosophila oocytes to the aging process has profound implications regarding the vulnerability of human oocytes to age-induced loss of meiotic cohesion. Our data argue that the meiotic stage (dictyate) at which human oocytes remain suspended as women age is also the stage during which recombinant chromosomes are at highest risk for loss of chiasmata.</p><p>Because the achiasmate pathway in Drosophila oocytes will ensure the accurate segregation of recombinant chromosomes that lose chiasmata due to deterioration of arm cohesion during the aging process, we needed to dismantle this system for our analysis.

Recent work has demonstrated that Mtrm protein physically interacts with and inhibits the activity of Polo kinase in Drosophila oocytes from stage 11 until nuclear envelope breakdown (NEB) at stage 13 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000263-Xiang1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. When Mtrm protein is reduced (<italic>mtrm<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup></italic>), NEB can occur prematurely (at stage 12) and the spindle assembles around a karyosome that is less compact than in wild type. Although this may account for the eventual missegregation of achiasmate chromosomes in <italic>mtrm<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> heterozygotes, sister chromatid cohesion remains intact in these oocytes as evidenced by the striking chiasmata visible in the individualized bivalents <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000263-Xiang1">&#x0005b;22&#x0005d;</xref>. In addition, premature NEB in <italic>mtrm<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x02212;</sup></italic> oocytes still occurs much later than the stages that exhibit sensitivity to aging in our experiments (stages 7&#x02013;8). Therefore, we conclude that reducing the dosage of Mtrm is not causing the increased missegregation of recombinant chormosomes that we observe in aged oocytes.</p><p>Because the achiasmate segregation pathway is not completely disrupted in <italic>mtrm<sup>KG08051</sup></italic> heterozygotes, we also have been able to assess the effect of aging on the segregation of non-recombinant chromosomes. Interestingly, our data demonstrate that when the dosage of SMC1 is reduced, MI missegregation of non-recombinant chromosomes also increases with age. This result is reminiscent of our previous findings that NDJ of achiasmate chromosomes increases with age when activity of the meiotic cohesion protein ORD is compromised by a hypomorphic missense mutation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000263-Jeffreys1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>.

In addition, our recent data indicate that heterochromatin-mediated pairing is moderately disrupted by <italic>ord</italic> mutations, even in the absence of aging (VVS and SEB, unpublished results). Together, these data suggest that in addition to holding sister chromatids together, cohesion proteins play an important role in maintaining the heterochromatic pairing of achiasmate homologues in Drosophila oocytes. Whether cohesion proteins function directly to &#x0201c;glue&#x0201d; homologues together or play a more indirect role, such as influencing the structure of heterochromatin, remains to be determined. Regardless of the mechanism, loss of heterochromatin-associated cohesion proteins with age could account for the increased missegregation of non-recombinant chromosomes that we observe.</p><p>Our data support the hypothesis that age-dependent NDJ in women is caused at least in part by progressive loss of sister-chromatid cohesion over time. One unresolved issue regarding meiotic cohesion in human oocytes is whether the original cohesin molecules used to establish cohesion are maintained for decades or continually replaced as oocytes age. Addressing this question will be essential in understanding the specific mechanisms that lead to loss of meiotic cohesion and chiasma maintenance during the aging process. Early experiments in yeast led to the widely accepted model that cohesion between sister chromatids can only be established during DNA replication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000263-Tanaka1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000263-Toth1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>.

In addition, experiments in yeast have recently demonstrated that cohesion can be re-established on a genome-wide scale during G2/M in a DNA damage-dependent manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000263-Strom1">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000263-Unal1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref> and support the model that non-canonical mechanisms can establish cohesion after S phase is completed.</p><p>The power of genetic manipulation combined with the ability to age oocytes makes Drosophila an ideal model system to address whether re-establishment of meiotic cohesion occurs during prophase I. These future studies will be pivotal in understanding how cohesion dynamics during meiosis govern chiasma maintenance and ultimately, why and how loss of cohesion occurs as oocytes age.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Drosophila stocks</title><p>Flies were reared at 25&#x000b0;C on standard cornmeal molasses media.
