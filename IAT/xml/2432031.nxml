It has been suggested that epigenetic reprogramming may be necessary for the embryonic genome to return to a pluripotent state. We have carried out a genome-wide promoter analysis of DNA methylation in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells, embryonic germ (EG) cells, sperm, trophoblast stem (TS) cells, and primary embryonic fibroblasts (pMEFs). Global clustering analysis shows that methylation patterns of ES cells, EG cells, and sperm are surprisingly similar, suggesting that while the sperm is a highly specialized cell type, its promoter epigenome is already largely reprogrammed and resembles a pluripotent state. Comparisons between pluripotent tissues and pMEFs reveal that a number of pluripotency related genes, including <italic>Nanog</italic>, <italic>Lefty1</italic> and <italic>Tdgf1</italic>, as well as the nucleosome remodeller <italic>Smarcd1</italic>, are hypomethylated in stem cells and hypermethylated in differentiated cells. Differences in promoter methylation are associated with significant differences in transcription levels in more than 60&#x00025; of genes analysed. Our comparative approach to promoter methylation thus identifies gene candidates for the regulation of pluripotency and epigenetic reprogramming. While the sperm genome is, overall, similarly methylated to that of ES and EG cells, there are some key exceptions, including <italic>Nanog</italic> and <italic>Lefty1</italic>, that are highly methylated in sperm. <italic>Nanog</italic> promoter methylation is erased by active and passive demethylation after fertilisation before expression commences in the morula. In ES cells the normally active <italic>Nanog</italic> promoter is silenced when targeted by <italic>de novo</italic> methylation. Our study suggests that reprogramming of promoter methylation is one of the key determinants of the epigenetic regulation of pluripotency genes. Epigenetic reprogramming in the germline prior to fertilisation and the reprogramming of key pluripotency genes in the early embryo is thus crucial for transmission of pluripotency.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Large scale epigenetic reprogramming occurs in mammalian germ cells and the early embryo. The biological purpose of this reprogramming is largely unknown, although it has been suggested that it may be required for the embryonic genome to return to a pluripotent state. We carried out a genome-wide screen of promoter methylation in the mouse, comparing germ cells with pluripotent cells, multipotent cells, and more differentiated cell types. We find that promoter methylation is an epigenetic signature of developmental potency. Genes linked to pluripotency are generally hypomethylated in stem cells and hypermethylated (and silenced) in more differentiated cell types, and our genome-wide screen provides new candidates for the regulation of pluripotency. Importantly, germ cells resemble pluripotent cell types in that most promoters have been reprogrammed. However, a small group of key pluripotency regulators (including <italic>Nanog</italic>), are methylated in mature germ cells, presumably in order to suppress pluripotency at critical stages of germ cell differentiation. Indeed, methylation in these genes becomes reprogrammed after fertilisation so that the embryo can regain totipotency. This work, therefore, shows for the first time that epigenetic reprogramming is crucial for maintaining the pluripotency of germ and embryonic stem cells.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="17"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>DNA methylation in CpG dinucleotides is the only known epigenetic modification of DNA in vertebrates.

DNA methylation has key roles in epigenetic gene regulation and silencing, in particular in genomic imprinting, X chromosome inactivation, and silencing of retrotransposons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000116-Bird1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000116-Schaefer1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>. To what extent, in general, methylation or demethylation of gene promoters plays a role in transcriptional regulation during development is still debated.</p><p>During mammalian development there are cycles of genome-wide reprogramming of DNA methylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000116-Reik2">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>.

This early reprogramming is followed by specific demethylation of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in imprinted genes from E10.5, as PGCs enter the gonads, until E12.5, and by partial demethylation of repetitive elements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000116-Hajkova1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000116-Lee1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. A key biological purpose of demethylation during PGC development is the erasure of imprints, so that they can be replaced at later stages of gametogenesis with the appropriate gametic methylation patterns in DMRs. These reprogramming events during PGC development coincide with the re-expression of some pluripotency genes, including <italic>Sox2</italic> and <italic>Nanog</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000116-Yamaguchi1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, and the ability to derive pluripotent stem cells (EG cells) into culture. Whilst it is not known if demethylation is required for this re-expression of pluripotency genes, other genes needed for germ cell development such as <italic>Mvh</italic>, <italic>Dazl</italic>, and <italic>Scp3</italic> are demethylated and expressed at this time <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000116-Maatouk1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>As gametogenesis progresses DNA methylation patterns are set up in a sex- and sequence-specific manner.

We used the recently developed meDIP (methylated DNA Immuno-Precipitation) method in combination with hybridisation to genome-wide promoter tiling arrays (NimbleGen) for this comparison <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000116-Weber1">&#x0005b;32&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000116-Weber3">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. Our original hypothesis was that the mature gametic genome (here exemplified by sperm) was epigenetically substantially different from pluripotent genomes (ES and EG cells). We were therefore surprised to find that the sperm promoter methylome very closely resembled that of pluripotent cells, suggesting substantial reprogramming prior to fertilisation. However, some key regulators of pluripotency such as <italic>Nanog</italic> were methylated in sperm, demethylation occurred after fertilisation, and this demethylation was necessary for their expression in stem cells. The overall conclusion from this work is that DNA methylation marks at key regulators of pluripotency are erased in the early embryo, a process which is critical for early development and for the establishment of a totipotent state.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>MeDIP Array Analysis of Mouse Promoters</title><p>We analysed methylation of 26,275 mouse promoters by immunoprecipitation of sheared genomic DNA with an anti-5-methylcytosine antibody and hybridisation to NimbleGen Mouse oligonucleotide promoter tiling arrays (2005-03-31_MM5). Genomic DNA was extracted from biological triplicates each of E11.5 and E12.5 EG cells, ES cells, TS cells, sperm, and primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts from E12.5 embryos (pMEFs), and was immunoprecipitated. The quality of the immunoprecipitation was determined by analysing enrichment of two genes with known methylation patterns (data not shown).</p><p>Examining the overall distribution of signals on the arrays we found an increase in average signal intensity between 0&#x02013;5&#x00025; CpG content, followed by a decrease in signal for regions between 5&#x02013;9&#x00025; CpG content and a flat line for regions above 9&#x00025; CpG content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000116-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). This distribution reflects the generally hypomethylated state of CpG-rich promoters and CpG islands (above 9&#x00025; CpG content), whilst we infer that relatively CpG-poor promoters can become methylated in normal tissues. The pattern observed for mouse promoters is thus similar to that recently reported for human promoters, using the same assay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000116-Weber3">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><fig id="pgen-1000116-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pgen.1000116.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Global relationship between meDIP signal and CpG content.</title><p>(A) Scatter plot of meDIP methylation signal (Log<sub>2</sub> ratio) in all promoters with varying CpG content (example shown is from an ES cell sample and is representative of the pattern observed in all cell types analysed).

In agreement with this, we found that high CpG content promoters are mostly unmethylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000116-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). In addition, we notice that most of the microarray signals from the high CpG content promoters failed to pass our significance test (see Experimental Procedures for details), suggesting a potential technical difficulty in measuring the methylation signals in the high CpG content regions. Therefore, we limited our subsequent analyses to a CpG content between 2 and 9&#x00025;, thus excluding highly methylated CpG poor promoters (&#x0003c;2&#x00025;) and those unmethylated promoters which contain CpG islands (&#x0003e;9&#x00025;) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000116.s002">Table S1</xref>).

We were interested in comparing global methylation patterns of promoters between these cell types. To make these comparisons the ratios from the meDIP arrays were used to generate a correlation value between each pair of tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000116-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). This clearly showed that the global promoter methylation patterns of ES cells, EG cells and sperm correlate well with each other, as do those in pMEFs and TS cells. However, methylation patterns between these two groups (ES cells, EG cells and sperm versus pMEFs and TS cells) differed substantially and significantly (p&#x0003c;0.0001). This analysis also showed that the promoter methylation profile of TS cells is less different to that of the pluripotent cells (ES and EG cells) and sperm than the pMEF promoter methylation is, even though they are still significantly different (p&#x0003c;0.01 and p&#x0003c;0.0001, respectively). This may reflect the diverse differentiation potentials between TS cells and pMEFs. Since the potency of TS cells is restricted to the extraembryonic trophoblast lineage, it suggests that its differentiation potential is more constrained by DNA methylation than that of ES or EG cells, but somewhat less constrained than that of pMEFs. On the other hand, the tight correlation of EG with ES cells is perhaps expected given that both cell types are pluripotent, and should only differ in the methylation of the small number of imprinted genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000116-Tada1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref> and potentially of autosomal germ line-restricted genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000116-Fouse1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000116-Maatouk2">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000116-Imamura1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. The correlation of EG and ES cells with sperm was surprising, but suggests that, as far as promoter methylation is concerned, sperm is very comparable to pluripotent cell types. Indeed, most promoters that were found hypomethylated in ES cells but hypermethylated in pMEFs were also hypomethylated in sperm, and this general pattern was confirmed by sequence-specific methylation analysis (see below, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000116-g003">Figure 3A</xref>).

The global meDIP analysis provided mean signal intensity values that required correction to identify the baseline between methylated and unmethylated sequences. As an alternative we pursued a comparative approach and Gene Ontology (GO) analysis was used to identify categories within which genes differed significantly in promoter methylation patterns between ES cells and pMEFs or ES and TS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000116-g002">Figure 2B, C</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pgen-1000116-t001">Table 1</xref>). Interestingly, the majority of differences occurred in the same direction, with promoters being hypomethylated in ES cells, and hypermethylated in pMEFs or TS cells, respectively. Three GO categories (nucleus, regulation of transcription, zinc ion binding) were shared between the two comparisons between cell types, indicating that most genes that are hypomethylated in pluripotent cells are likely to act in the nucleus and be involved in transcriptional regulation. GO categories that differ between the groups may indicate molecular pathways that are more prevalent in embryonic (ubiquitin cycle, posttranslational modifications) or extraembryonic (RNA processing)

Algorithms were developed to assess differences in promoter methylation between the different cell types, and validated using a bisulphite treated DNA and mass spectrometry based analysis (Sequenom MassArray). We find that the meDIP method combined with array hybridisation and stringent bioinformatics evaluation is a robust method for genome-wide evaluation of DNA methylation patterns.</p><p>Global comparisons between different cell types strongly suggest that promoter methylation is an epigenetic signature of developmental potency. Our study thus provides three key insights into the epigenetic regulation of pluripotency. Firstly, we find that a considerable number of gene promoters become methylated during stem cell differentiation. Secondly, our global clustering analysis shows that methylation patterns of promoters in ES cells, EG cells and sperm are surprisingly similar, suggesting that while the sperm is a highly specialized cell type, its promoter epigenome is already largely reprogrammed, resembling a pluripotent state. Thirdly, we found that while the sperm genome is overall similarly methylated to that of ES and EG cells, there are some key exceptions for which reprogramming in the early embryo is necessary.</p><p>Comparing ES cells and pMEFs, the greatest differences in methylation involve 69 gene promoters predicted to be hypomethylated in ES cells, and methylated in pMEFs. These genes are also generally predicted to be hypomethylated in EG cells by our meDIP analysis. The same holds true of the comparison between ES and TS cells; 67 genes are predicted to be hypomethylated in ES and hypermethylated in TS cells, but only 3 genes show the reverse pattern. A recent study, which compared promoter methylation in wild-type ES cells with those deficient in DNA methylation, identified a small number of genes whose promoters are methylated in ES cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000116-Fouse1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. Our study design, comparing different cell types, would not identify genes methylated in ES cells if they were not differentially methylated in other cell types. Hence, we find that there is a general tendency for a subset of gene promoters to become methylated in more differentiated cell types and in a lineage-specific fashion, consistent with a number of other studies which examined individual gene candidates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000116-Yeo1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000116-Feldman1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>. Our study focussed on promoters with a CpG content between 2 and 9&#x00025;, the so called &#x02018;intermediate CpG promoter (ICP) class&#x02019; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000116-Weber3">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>, in which most dynamic changes in methylation appear to occur at least in humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000116-Weber3">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Gene expression analysis demonstrated that up to 61&#x00025; of genes have promoter methylation associated with their relative gene silencing, whilst the rest of validated genes with differences in promoter methylation show little correlation in gene expression between cell types. Thus, while promoter methylation appears to be a major epigenetic determinant of gene expression, other epigenetic marking systems also have important roles to play <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000116-Oakes1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000116-Weber3">&#x0005b;34&#x0005d;</xref>. For example, a recently published promoter methylation study in ES cells suggests that demethylation is necessary but not sufficient for gene activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000116-Fouse1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. Furthermore, our comparisons of the meDIP data to whole genome histone modification mapping and PcG-binding studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000116-Mikkelsen1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref> support the idea that gene repression mediated by DNA methylation or by repressive histone modifications (e.g. H3K27me3) or PcG proteins is mechanistically unconnected. The only exception to this pattern was that genes bound by polycomb complex proteins (such as Eed and Suz12) in ES cells tend to become more methylated in TS cells, suggesting that a proposed link between polycomb silencing and DNA methylation may be restricted to the extraembryonic tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000116-Vire1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>. Interestingly, Nanog and Oct4 target genes were relatively hypomethylated in ES cells, and became hypermethylated during cell lineage commitment. This suggests that Nanog/Oct4 binding together with DNA hypomethylation is part of the pluripotency network to maintain an undifferentiated cell state. This class of genes was also broadly marked by H3K4me3 in ES cells, suggesting that their promoters are actively protected from <italic>de novo</italic> methylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000116-Ooi1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref> in pluripotent cell types, while this protection is lost during lineage commitment and differentiation.</p><p>Our screen established that transcription factors represents one of the main groups of genes being hypomethylated in ES cells, which was also observed in another recent promoter methylation study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000116-Fouse1">&#x0005b;35&#x0005d;</xref>. This finding is consistent with the fact that a number of transcription factors are crucial for the establishment and maintenance of the pluripotent state <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000116-Zhou1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000116-Kim1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref>, and hence our analysis may have identified additional key regulators in this network. More unexpectedly, genes belonging to the ubiquitin cycle and posttranslational protein modifications were enriched in the ES cells versus pMEFs comparison. The ubiquitin cycle is a part of the process of posttranslational protein modification and includes both deubiquitination and ubiquitination of proteins, including histones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000116-Zhang1">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref>. Of note is the presence of <italic>Rnf2</italic> (<italic>Ring1B</italic>), a member of the polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1), which mediates the monoubiquitination of histone H2A lysine 119 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000116-Wang1">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref> and has recently been shown to have an important role in repressing developmental control genes in ES cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000116-Leeb1">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref>. Epigenetic regulation through histone ubiquitination may be an, as yet, unexplored facet of pluripotent cell types. Differences in expression and activity of genes related to the ubiquitin cycle may also be related to a different rate of protein degradation in ES cells and pMEFs. The pluripotent nature of ES cells involves their ability to rapidly respond to stimuli such as differentiation signals. Therefore, they would be predicted to have a higher rate of protein turnover than differentiated cells, and indeed such a correlation has been found in the myogenic differentiation pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000116-Sun1">&#x0005b;57&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Our meDIP data show that genes with the most pronounced methylation differences between ES cells and pMEFs have a preference for expression in early development. This suggests that early transcriptional competence is retained as hypomethylation within the cells of the ICM, and thus ES cells where expression may be reduced by other mechanisms, and subsequently permanently repressed by hypermethylation in differentiated cells. Through this comparison, we identified genes that include pluripotency factors and early patterning genes such as <italic>Nanog</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000116-Mitsui1">&#x0005b;58&#x0005d;</xref>, <italic>Tdgf1</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000116-Babaie1">&#x0005b;59&#x0005d;</xref>, and <italic>Lefty1</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000116-Nakatake1">&#x0005b;60&#x0005d;</xref>, genes involved in RNA transport with a function in germ cells such as <italic>Akap1</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000116-Lin1">&#x0005b;61&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000116-Newhall1">&#x0005b;62&#x0005d;</xref>, the regulator of apoptosis, <italic>Bcl2l10</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000116-Zhang2">&#x0005b;63&#x0005d;</xref>, and the tumour suppressor gene <italic>Mia2</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000116-Hellerbrand1">&#x0005b;64&#x0005d;</xref>.

Additionally, when this comparison was evaluated against the ES versus TS cell comparison, 14 genes were found to be overlapping on the lists (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000116.s005">Table S4</xref>). Presumably this comparison is also enriched for genes with functions in the germline, early embryogenesis, and the regulation of pluripotency. A role in these processes can therefore also be envisaged for the genes that came out of these comparisons whose function is yet to be determined.</p><p>We find that promoter methylation in sperm is strikingly similar to that in ES and EG cells. This means that the sperm genome, on the whole, has not acquired promoter methylation that would need to be erased after fertilisation to enable zygotic gene expression from the paternal genome. Thus, while the sperm itself is a highly differentiated cell type with a specialised function, its promoter methylome resembles that of other cell types of the pluripotency-germline cycle. Importantly this suggests that promoters in sperm, on a genome-wide scale, do not need to undergo extensive reprogramming by demethylation at fertilisation. This is in agreement with recently published work analysing differentially methylated regions specific to the testis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000116-Oakes1">&#x0005b;21&#x0005d;</xref>, which tended not to be found in typical promoter regions. Gene promoters may be protected during spermatogenesis from substantial <italic>de novo</italic> methylation events which occur in other sequences. Large scale demethylation of the paternal genome upon fertilisation is thus likely to occur preferentially in transposons, and perhaps in inter and intragenic regions. Indeed, the Line1 family transposons (with about 100,000 members in the mouse genome) are massively demethylated upon fertilisation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000116-Lane1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>Whilst the global methylation of the sperm genome, as analysed by meDIP, closely resembles that of the pluripotent cell types, ES and EG cells, there are some notable and important exceptions to this rule. The promoters of genes such as <italic>Nanog</italic>, <italic>Lefty1,</italic> and <italic>Brd1</italic> are highly methylated in sperm; this is also observed for <italic>Oct4</italic>, <italic>Fgf4</italic>, <italic>Fbx15,</italic> and <italic>Sox2</italic> (albeit outside of the promoter) in other studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000116-Imamura1">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000116-Ariel1">&#x0005b;67&#x0005d;</xref>. These genes alone or in combination are key regulators of the pluripotent state. Hence, they may not only have to be permanently silenced in somatic cells, but also during the later stages of spermatogenesis when pluripotency is lost. This regulation might resolve a conflict within the germ line between transmitting totipotency to the next generation, whilst preventing the formation of teratomas. Reprogramming of these key genes by demethylation after fertilisation would be required to achieve pluripotency of early embryos. Indeed our experiments show that the promoter of <italic>Nanog</italic> is rapidly demethylated after fertilisation by both active and passive demethylation and is virtually unmethylated in the morula when its expression commences. This demethylation is necessary for expression as shown by targeting <italic>de novo</italic> methylation to the <italic>Nanog</italic> promoter in ES cells, which resulted in significant transcriptional silencing. Suppression of <italic>Nanog</italic> promoter activity by <italic>in vitro</italic> methylation has also been shown in a reporter assay in both ES and TS cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000116-Hattori1">&#x0005b;68&#x0005d;</xref>. We have not examined methylation in preimplantation embryos of the other genes we found methylated in sperm; however, we suggest that they become demethylated early after fertilisation since they lack methylation in ES cells. Erasure of DNA methylation at specific key loci in the early embryo is therefore one of the epigenetic reprogramming events necessary for the establishment of the pluripotent state.</p><p>It is interesting to ask if these regulators of pluripotency are not only epigenetically silenced in somatic cells and definitive gametogenesis, but also during the allocation of PGCs in the early postimplantation embryo. For example, <italic>Nanog</italic> expression is silenced in early PGCs (E7.25) but is re-expressed from E7.75, coincident with the ability of deriving pluripotent EG cells into culture <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000116-Yamaguchi1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>. It is not known whether this cycle of silencing and re-expression also involves DNA methylation, but the timing of re-expression coincides with some major epigenetic erasure events in the PGCs, including DNA demethylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000116-Seki1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. We therefore speculate that there might be another cycle of <italic>de novo</italic> methylation and demethylation in early PGCs, and that this may be required for pluripotency of EG cells.</p><p>We conclude that most promoters in the mouse genome remain unmethylated during the germline-pluripotency life-cycle. This guards the germline against acquisition of metastable epi-alleles and their transmission to future generations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000116-Chong1">&#x0005b;69&#x0005d;</xref>. A small number of genes which regulate pluripotency undergo cycles of <italic>de novo</italic> methylation and demethylation in the germline and the early embryo, presumably to enable loss and re-establishment of pluripotency in a cyclical fashion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000116-Reik1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Demethylation of the promoters of these genes is thus critical for the pluripotent part of the germline cycle, while re-methylation is crucial for the differentiation part of this cycle. Although it has been reported that a pluripotent state can be induced in differentiated cells by forced expression of a small number of key transcription factors, the efficiency of reprogramming is low and requires a long selection process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000116-Takahashi1">&#x0005b;70&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pgen.1000116-Wernig1">&#x0005b;72&#x0005d;</xref>.

Candidates were selected randomly for the TS vs. ES cell comparison, and by a predominantly hierarchical approach based on the predicted methylation status in pMEFs for the pMEF vs ES cell comparison. Promoter regions were selected based on the position of the oligonucleotides on the NimbleGen promoter array and primer pairs were designed using the MethPrimer program (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.urogene.org/methprimer/index1.html">http://www.urogene.org/methprimer/index1.html</ext-link>). A complete list of primers used for analysis is available on request. Amplification of the bisulphite converted DNA, preparation of PCR products for quantitative analysis of promoter methylation detected by the Mass Array system was according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. An example of methylation analysis using this method is shown (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pgen.1000116.s001">Figure S1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4h"><title>Quantitative RT-PCR</title><p>Total RNA was purified from 3 cell types, R1-ES, pMEFs (passages 1) and TS cells, using the RNeasy kit (QIAGEN) to eliminate contaminating genomic DNA; this was followed by DNase treatment of eluted RNA. cDNA was synthesized using SuperScript II reverse transcriptase and Oligo (dT) primers (Invitrogen) in a 20 &#x000b5;l reaction volume according to the manufacturer's protocol. For the PCR reactions we used Platinum SYBR Green qPCR SuperMix-UDG with ROX (Invitrogen) using the MX3005P machine (Stratagene). Reactions were done in triplicate using 1 &#x000b5;l of cDNA as a template in a 25 &#x000b5;l reaction volume. The amount of starting cDNA was normalized to three reference genes (<italic>Dynein</italic>, <italic>Rsp23</italic> and <italic>Hdac10-11</italic> in ES vs pMEFs; <italic>Dynein</italic>, <italic>Pmm1</italic> and <italic>Sdha</italic> in ES vs TS). The selected reference genes were the most consistently expressed of 12 tested references genes within the comparing cell types.</p></sec><sec id="s4i"><title>Comparison with Other ChIP Datasets</title><p>The meDIP datasets (ES cells versus pMEFs and ES cells versus TS cells) used were under the same filtering criteria as for the GO analysis.

A dataset of subtracted log<sub>2</sub> ratios for each gene in the ChIP dataset was constructed and this was tested for significant deviation from a mean of 0 using a 2-tailed t-test. T-test p-values were adjusted using Bonferoni multiple testing correction. A p-value of &#x0003c;0.01 was taken to indicate an overall shift in the methylation state in the subset of genes.</p></sec><sec id="s4j"><title>Transient Cell Transfection</title><p>PMEF feeder cells were seeded at 5&#x000d7;10<sup>5</sup> cells/well in six-well tissue culture plates coated with gelatin and incubated for 24 h. The growth medium was removed and R1 ES (5&#x000d7;10<sup>5</sup>) cells were plated in ES medium with LIF one day before transfection. Plasmids for co-transfection, including Gal4-Dnmt3a WT and Mut (6 &#x000b5;g/well), pdsRed2-C1 (1 &#x000b5;g/well), Nanog promoter GFP reporter plasmids including LR/Nanog-GFP, 3xUAS-NanogGFP and 6xUAS-NanogGFP (1 &#x000b5;g/well) were diluted with Opti-MEM I Reduced Serum Medium without serum.

The ChIPMonk profile of the promoter region of <italic>Lefty1</italic> in ES and TS cells is shown in the top panel. The middle line represents the median signal intensity of the array. Each vertical bar represents the methylation signal at an individual oligonucleotide probe; above the median line indicates relative hypermethylation and below indicates relative hypomethylation. Bisulphite sequencing analysis of the promoter of <italic>Lefty1</italic> showed that it is highly methylated in TS cells but not in ES cells, which is in agreement with the meDIP ChIPMonk pattern above. CpG dinucleotides are represented as open circles (unmethylated) or closed circles (methylated). The percentage of CpG methylation is indicated in brackets. A Sequenom profile of the promoter is shown in the middle panel. Sequenom MassArray technology gives quantitative measurements of the methylation level and is comparable to the classical bisulphite sequencing analysis. Blue circles indicate complete methylation; yellow circles indicate no methylation at individual CpG units. Examples of the MassArray spectra of a differentially methylated CpG unit upon which this colour coding is based are shown in the bottom panel. Methylation level is measured by the area ratio of methylation peak to non-methylation peak. The number of differentially methylated CpGs was counted and the average methylation level across those CpGs in each cell type plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pgen-1000116-g003">Figure 3A</xref>.</p><p>(2.16 MB TIF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pgen.1000116.s001.tif" mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pgen.1000116.s002"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p>Summary of the genes analysed and the different filters which removed them.</p><p>(0.03 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pgen.1000116.s002.doc" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pgen.1000116.s003"><label>Table S2</label><caption><p>Gene list of ES cell versus pMEFs comparison.</p><p>(0.03 MB XLS)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pgen.1000116.s003.xls" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.ms-excel"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pgen.1000116.s004"><label>Table S3</label><caption><p>Gene list of ES cell versus TS cell comparison.</p><p>(0.03 MB XLS)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pgen.1000116.s004.xls" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.ms-excel"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pgen.1000116.s005"><label>Table S4</label><caption><p>Gene list of overlapping genes between ES cell versus pMEFs and ES cell versus TS cell comparisons.</p><p>(0.02 MB XLS)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pgen.1000116.s005.xls" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="vnd.ms-excel"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are very grateful for help and advice from T.
