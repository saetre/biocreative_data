The transcription factor Stat1 is essential for innate immunity and tumor immunosurveillance through its ability to act downstream of interferons. Herein, we demonstrate that Stat1 functions as a suppressor of Ras transformation independently of an interferon response. Inhibition of Ras transformation and tumorigenesis requires the phosphorylation of Stat1 at tyrosine 701 but is independent of Stat1 phosphorylation at serine 727. Stat1 induces p27<sup>Kip1</sup> expression in Ras transformed cells at the transcriptional level through mechanisms that depend on Stat1 phosphorylation at tyrosine 701 and activation of Stat3. The tumor suppressor properties of Stat1 in Ras transformation are reversed by the inactivation of p27<sup>Kip1</sup>. Our work reveals a novel functional link between Stat1 and p27<sup>Kip1</sup>, which act in coordination to suppress the oncogenic properties of activated Ras. It also supports the notion that evaluation of Stat1 phosphorylation in human tumors may prove a reliable prognostic factor for patient outcome and a predictor of treatment response to anticancer therapies aimed at activating Stat1 and its downstream effectors.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="15"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The signal transducers and activators of transcription (Stats) are a family of cytoplasmic proteins that function as signal messengers and transcription factors involved in cellular responses induced by cytokines and growth factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003476-Schindler1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003476-Levy1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>.

The ability of Stat1 to act upstream of p27<sup>Kip1</sup> is a property of Ras transformation because Stat1 did not exhibit similar effects on <italic>Cdkn1b</italic> gene transcription or expression and localization of p27<sup>Kip1</sup> in immortalized MEFs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003476.s003">Fig. S3</xref>). Moreover, induction of <italic>Cdkn1b</italic> gene transcription by Stat1 in Ras-transformed MEFs is independent of p53 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003476.s004">Fig. S4</xref>). The transcriptional effect of Stat1 on the <italic>Cdkn1b</italic> promoter depends on Y701 phosphorylation but is independent of S727 phosphorylation. Given the essential role of S727 phosphorylation in the transactivation properties of Stat1 in response to IFNs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003476-Wen1">&#x0005b;40&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003476-Varinou1">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>, the dispensable role of S727 phosphorylation in the induction of the <italic>Cdkn1b</italic> gene indicated that transactivation of the <italic>Cdkn1b</italic> promoter was mediated by a protein other than Stat1. Consistent with this notion, our data demonstrated that the transcriptional induction of the <italic>Cdkn1b</italic> gene by Stat1 occurs in cooperation with Stat3. Stat3 was previously shown to activate the <italic>Cdkn1b</italic> gene during myeloid cell differentiation in response to IL-6 and G-CSF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003476-deKoning1">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003476-Kortylewski2">&#x0005b;42&#x0005d;</xref>. The ability of Stat1 to cooperate with Stat3 in the transcriptional activation of the <italic>Cdkn1b</italic> gene suggests that Stat1 is capable of re-programming the biological function of Stat3 by converting it from a positive to a negative regulator of cell proliferation. At first glance, the ability of Stat3 to induce the expression of p27<sup>Kip1</sup> in Ras transformed cells was not in line with its well characterized role as a positive regulator of cell proliferation and tumorigenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003476-Bromberg2">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003476-Yu1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>. However, recent findings support the notion that Stat3 also possesses the capacity to impair cell proliferation and oncogenesis in a manner that depends on the signalling pathway and the genetic background of the target cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003476-delaInglesia1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>. Although transcriptional control of the <italic>Cdkn1b</italic> gene by Stat1 plays a major role in regulating p27<sup>Kip1</sup> levels in Ras transformed cells, the possibility that Stat1 can also regulate <italic>Cdkn1b</italic> gene expression at the post-transcriptional level can not be ruled out. This notion is supported by the observation that p27<sup>Kip1</sup> is more highly expressed in Ras transformed MEFs reconstituted with Stat1 WT than with Stat1S727A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003476-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>) although both Stat1 proteins induce <italic>Cdkn1b</italic> gene transcription at comparable levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003476-g002">Figs. 2C and D</xref>). Possible post-transcriptional regulation of <italic>Cdkn1b</italic> gene expression may occur at the level of mRNA translation and/or protein stability. At the translational level, Stat1 was previously shown to signal to the cellular translational machinery via physical and functional interactions with the eIF2&#x003b1; kinase PKR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003476-Wong1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003476-Wong2">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>. At the post-translational level, the potential effects of Stat1 may be exerted through its ability to inhibit the transcription of <italic>c-myc</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003476-Ramana1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>, which induces the expression of proteins, including Cyclin D1, that sequester and inhibit p27<sup>Kip1</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003476-Chu1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>.

Our findings show that Stat1 is required for the upregulation of both p21<sup>Cip1</sup> and p27<sup>Kip1</sup> in Ras transformed cells in the absence of IFN treatment. It has been well documented that mitogens increase p21<sup>Cip1</sup> levels through the activation of Ras and Raf-MAPK signalling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003476-Coleman1">&#x0005b;29&#x0005d;</xref> which results in increased transcription of the <italic>Cdkn1a</italic> gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003476-Liu1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>. Consistent with these findings, we found that induction of p21<sup>Cip1</sup> in Ras transformed cells is dependent on Stat1 and is mediated at the transcriptional level (data not shown). However, unlike p27<sup>Kip1</sup>, the induction of p21<sup>Cip1</sup> levels in Ras transformed cells depends on both tyrosine and serine phosphorylation of Stat1. Although Stat1 upregulates p21<sup>Cip1</sup> and p27<sup>Kip1</sup> levels in Ras transformed cells through separate mechanisms, both Cdk inhibitors appear to be involved in G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1</sub> arrest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003476-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). It is of interest that the cell cycle inhibitory effects of Stat1 were increased in confluent cell cultures indicating a role of intercellular adhesion signalling in this process. Consistent with this observation, it was shown that Stat1 becomes activated by the focal adhesion kinase (FAK) with important implications in the regulation of cell adhesion and migration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003476-Xie1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>.

Specifically, Stat1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>mice are more prone to chemical induced carcinogenesis than Stat1<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> mice, and Stat1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice bred onto p53<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> background develop spontaneous tumors more rapidly than the p53<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003476-Kaplan1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. The high incidence of tumor formation in Stat1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> animals is partly explained by impaired tumor immunosurveillance caused by defects in IFN-&#x003b3;-signalling and natural killer cell activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003476-Dunn1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. Previous work established that the sensitivity of tumors to IFN-&#x003b3; is required for the development of an anti-tumor response in immunocompetent hosts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003476-Kaplan1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>. Because nude mice are not completely immunodeficient <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003476-Dunn2">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref>, the observed differences in tumor growth of the Ras transformed MEFs might have been attributed to their responsiveness to IFN-&#x003b3;. However, we found that the responsiveness of the Ras transformed MEFs to IFN-&#x003b3; did not correlate with their growth properties in nude mice. That is, although IFN-&#x003b3;-mediated gene transactivation was impaired in Ras transformed cells expressing Stat1S727A (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003476.s005">Fig. S5</xref>), these cells were barely tumorigenic in nude mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003476-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). These observations argued against a role of tumor immunosurveillance in regulation of tumor growth in nude mice in our system. Also, growth of Ras-transformed cells in soft agar correlated with their growth in nude mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003476-g005">Fig. 5</xref>) further supporting a direct role of Stat1 in suppression of Ras-mediated tumorigenesis. Our approach with shRNA clearly demonstrated that the anti-tumor activity of Stat1 is dependent on p27<sup>Kip1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003476-g006">Fig. 6</xref>). It is of interest that tumor growth of Ras-transformed MEFs in nude mice is more highly suppressed by Stat1S727A than Stat1 WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003476-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). Inasmuch as both Stat1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003476-Huang1">&#x0005b;53&#x0005d;</xref> and p27<sup>Kip1</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003476-Goukassian1">&#x0005b;55&#x0005d;</xref> are involved in suppression of angiogenesis and Stat1 phosphorylation is affected by tumor hypoxia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003476-Terui1">&#x0005b;56&#x0005d;</xref>, tumor microenvironment may have more pronounced effects on the inhibition of tumor growth of Ras-transformed cells containing Stat1S727A than cells containing Stat1 WT. The effects of Stat1 are not confined to Ras-transformed MEFs only since activation of the K-Ras pathway in lung tissue by urethane results in a higher tumor incidence in Stat1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> than in Stat1<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003476-g007">Fig. 7</xref>). Although the increased tumor formation in urethane treated Stat1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice could partly involve defects in tumor immunosurveillance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003476-Dunn2">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref>, the higher incidence of lung tumor formation in Stat1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> compared to Stat1<sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> mice was proportional to Ras-MAPK activation and inversely proportional to p27<sup>Kip1</sup>. Given that urethane-treated <italic>Cdkn1b</italic><sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> mice were more prone to lung tumorigenesis than <italic>Cdkn1b</italic><sup>&#x0002b;/&#x0002b;</sup> mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003476-Besson5">&#x0005b;57&#x0005d;</xref>, together these data suggest that Stat1 and p27<sup>Kip1</sup> act in the same pathway to inhibit Ras-mediated oncogenesis. It is of interest that ERK1/2 phosphorylation was diminished in lung tumors containing Stat1 compared to tumors devoid of Stat1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003476-g007">Fig. 7C and D</xref>). This result indicated that Stat1 may have an inhibitory effect on Ras-MAPK signalling. Consistent with this notion, we noted that reconstitution of Ras-transfected Stat1<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup>p53<sup>&#x02212;/&#x02212;</sup> MEFs with Stat1 WT resulted in a significant inhibition of ERK1/2 phosphorylation compared to control MEFs or MEFs reconstituted with each of the Stat1 phosphorylation mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003476.s006">Fig. S6</xref>). The molecular basis of this inhibition is not immediately clear and represents the focus of future experiments. Given that activation of the Ras-MAPK pathway results in the degradation of p27<sup>Kip1</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003476-Chu1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, inhibition of the Ras-MAPK pathway by Stat1 may also reveal its ability to regulate p27<sup>Kip1</sup> at the post-translational level.</p><p>There has been an established link between Stat1 phosphorylation and human cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003476-Yu1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>. Specifically, Stat1 is constitutively phosphorylated at Y701 in many blood tumors including multiple myeloma, erythroleukemia and acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003476-Lin1">&#x0005b;58&#x0005d;</xref>. In the case of solid tumors, Y701 phosphorylation of Stat1 has been detected in breast as well as in head and neck cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003476-Yu1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>. Moreover, S727 phosphorylation of Stat1 is induced in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003476-Lin1">&#x0005b;58&#x0005d;</xref>, in Wilms' tumors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003476-Timofeeva1">&#x0005b;59&#x0005d;</xref> as well as in tumor cells deficient in tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) 1 and 2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003476-ElHashemite1">&#x0005b;60&#x0005d;</xref>. Given that phosphorylation is essential for Stat1 activation, detection of phosphorylated Stat1 in human tumors appears to be inconsistent with its anti-proliferative and tumor suppressor activities. However, recent findings showed that the anti-tumor function of Stat1 is determined by the type of the tumor and the oncogenic signalling within it. That is, Stat1 was shown to act as a promoter of leukemogenesis induced by v-abl and TEL-Jak2 oncogenes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003476-Kovacic1">&#x0005b;61&#x0005d;</xref>. Our findings suggest a different regulation of the anti-tumor activity of Stat1 by site-specific phosphorylation. That is, activated Ras has the capacity to decrease Y701 phosphorylation and increase S727 phosphorylation of Stat1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0003476.s001">Fig. S1</xref>). These differences in Stat1 phosphorylation may significantly contribute to Ras-mediated tumorigenesis based on the ability of Stat1S727A or Stat1Y701F to compromise or promote the transforming activity of Ras in MEFs respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003476-g005">Figs. 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0003476-g006">6</xref>). As such, it is reasonable to speculate that differences in the equilibrium between serine and tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat1 could determine the outcome of an oncogenic insult and the efficacy of chemotherapies aimed at inducing Stat1 phosphorylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003476-YoulyouzMarfak1">&#x0005b;62&#x0005d;</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0003476-Townsend1">&#x0005b;65&#x0005d;</xref>. Although Stat1 phosphorylation mutants have not been identified in human cancers, our findings indicate that Stat1 phosphorylation in tumors may interfere with the normal function of Stat1 and that the occurrence and frequency of site-specific phosphorylated Stat1 in human cancers could be of significant diagnostic and prognostic value.
