The FSHD locus has been mapped by linkage analysis to the subtelomeric region of the long arm of chromosome 4 (4q35) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The disorder is associated with the deletion of an integral number of tandemly arrayed 3.3-kb units (D4Z4) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Each D4Z4 repeat contains two homeoboxes within a single predicted open reading frame (ORF), double homeobox chromosome 4 (DUX4). The number of repeats varies from 11 to 110 in normal subjects, but is consistently less than 11 in FSHD patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], a contraction that is predominantly associated with a specific variant of chromosome 4 called 4qA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Only a few patients with phenotypic FSHD show normal-sized D4Z4 repeats on both chromosomes 4. It is interesting to note that the D4Z4 repeats in patients with D4Z4 contractions or phenotypic FSHD show reduced levels of DNA methylation. D4Z4 hypomethylation is more prominent and present on both chromosomes 4 in patients with phenotypic FSHD, but it is restricted to the diseased chromosome in those with 4q-linked FSHD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>The region immediately proximal to the D4Z4 repeats harbors a number of candidate genes. This FSHD locus includes FSHD-related gene 1 (<italic>FRG1</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], which encodes a nucleolar protein involved in RNA biogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]; <italic>TUBB4q</italic>, a member of the &#x003b2;-tubulin family; and <italic>FRG2</italic>, a predicted transcript with no significant homology to any known protein. The adenine nucleotide transporter 1 gene (<italic>ANT1</italic>), a gene involved in apoptosis, lies more distally from the 4qter (5.8 Mb) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>In addition to the DUX4 ORF within each unit of the tandem array, there is a DUX4-like sequence (named DUX4c) near <italic>FRG2</italic>. Preliminary data suggest that DUX4c may be expressed in FSHD samples [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], and it has been shown that its ectopic overexpression interferes with myogenic regulators and abolishes myoblast differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The expression of DUX4 RNA and protein has recently been selectively detected in primary myoblasts from FSHD patients, thus suggesting its involvement in FSHD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Furthermore, the overexpression of DUX4 in different cell lines induces cell toxicity and apoptosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. The overexpression of <italic>FRG2</italic>, <italic>FRG1</italic>, and <italic>ANT1 </italic>has been found in some muscles affected by FSHD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. It has also been shown that a transcriptional repressor complex binds D4Z4, and it is thought that D4Z4 deletion would trigger gene overexpression as a result of the lack of repression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]; the overexpression of <italic>FRG1</italic>, but not <italic>ANT1 </italic>and <italic>FRG2</italic>, in transgenic mice leads to a general muscle dystrophy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Furthermore, <italic>FRG1 </italic>overexpression in FSHD samples is not a uniform finding, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] and thus the contribution of the <italic>FRG1 </italic>gene to the FSHD phenotype needs further validation. The transcriptional alterations reported above in some of the genes of the FSHD locus may be caused by a perturbation of the chromatin structure driven by the deletion of D4Z4 units [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>This paper describes the crosstalking molecular events that occur within the FSHD locus. We concentrated on <italic>FRG1 </italic>because, although it is indicated as a candidate gene for FSHD pathogenesis, the molecular link between D4Z4 deletion and <italic>FRG1 </italic>deregulation remains unclear. We found that <italic>FRG1 </italic>is upregulated during myogenic differentiation and that FSHD myoblasts show significantly premature <italic>FRG1 </italic>expression in the early stages of differentiation. We investigated the chromatin features of <italic>FRG1 </italic>at hierarchical levels during myogenic differentiation in myoblasts derived from FSHD patients and normal individuals, and found that the <italic>FRG1 </italic>promoter undergoes chromatin remodeling involving the loss of the Polycomb repressor complex. Parallel analysis of D4Z4 repeats showed that the chromatin is marked by H3K27me3 (which is reduced in FSHD contracted alleles) and the Polycomb complex, and that both repressive markers are lost in myotubes. We further demonstrated that the physical interaction of the non-contiguous <italic>FRG1 </italic>and D4Z4 array, which is loosened in FSHD myoblasts, is remodeled upon cell differentiation. These results provide a connection between the deletion of D4Z4 repeats and the misregulation of the <italic>FRG1 </italic>candidate gene in FSHD cells.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><sec><title>FRG1 expression is upregulated during the myogenic differentiation of human myoblasts</title><p>We investigated the mechanisms that regulate <italic>FRG1 </italic>gene transcription during the myogenic differentiation of human primary myoblasts.

H3K4me3 was also present on the <italic>FRG1 </italic>promoter in other human non-muscle cells expressing <italic>FRG1 </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], such as HeLa and lymphoblasts (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1d</xref> part ii). These findings suggest that the very low <italic>FRG1 </italic>mRNA level observed in myoblasts is caused by active repression, based at least on the trimethylation of H3K27, whereas H3K4me3 is a hallmark of gene activation. The switch between H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 was monitored in all of the available myoblasts and myotubes, and found to be statistically significant in both controls and patients (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1e</xref>).</p><p>It has been previously shown that several muscle-specific genes in myoblasts are silenced as a result of the promoter recruitment of the histone H3K27 methyltransferase (HKMT) Ezh2 via YY1, two key components of the Polycomb complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], and that changes in H3K27 and YY1 binding can be associated with DNA methylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. Upon gene activation, YY1 and Ezh2 dissociate from their target promoters, H3K27 becomes hypomethylated, and MyoD and serum response factor (SRF) are recruited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. We analyzed the FRG1 promoter sequence using MatInspector software (Genomatix, Munich, Germany) and identified one CarG box (the DNA binding site of the YY1 protein) at position -371 from the transcriptional start site (+1), and two flanking E-boxes (the DNA binding site of the MyoD transcription factor) at positions -448 and -232 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1f</xref> part i). For these analyses, as the FRG1 genomic region is duplicated in the human genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], we designed primer pairs specifically aimed at the 4q FRG1 genomic copy and confirmed their selectivity by means of a panel of human somatic cell monohybrids (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). We performed ChIP experiments on myoblasts and myotubes using antibodies against H3K27me3, YY1, Ezh2 targeting the FRG1 YY1 regulatory region (FRG1 A) and the proximal promoter (FRG1 B) as a control (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1f</xref> part i) (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref> for the PCR primer pairs). In myoblasts, YY1 and Ezh2 were detected on CarG box (FRG1 A), and H3K27me3 widely marked the FRG1 promoter (FRG1 A and FRG1 B) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1f</xref> part ii).</p><p>We also carried out a methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) assay of the same FRG1 promoter regions (FRG1 A and FRG1 B) to analyze the DNA methylation status of the promoter, and mapped a region of DNA methylation in correspondence with the YY1 binding site (compare FRG1 A and FRG1 B in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1f</xref> part ii). After 8 days of differentiation, Polycomb complex binding and the H3K27me3 marker were lost (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1f</xref> part ii); however, there was no change in the DNA methylation pattern of the promoter, as has been previously reported in the case of other muscle genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].

In agreement with previous studies, we observed that <italic>FRG1 </italic>overexpression in muscle biopsies is not a uniform finding; indeed, only one FSHD sample showed <italic>FRG1 </italic>upregulation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2a</xref>). As <italic>FRG1 </italic>showed muscle-specific upregulation (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1a</xref>), we performed this analysis in primary myoblasts derived from the same muscle biopsies and during their myogenic differentiation of (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b</xref>). No <italic>FRG1 </italic>overexpression was detected in FSHD myoblasts, as these samples did not show any statistical significant difference compared to control cells. Indeed, two control samples showed a basal level of <italic>FRG1 </italic>expression higher than FSHD. Moreover, all the samples showed <italic>FRG1 </italic>upregulation during myoblasts differentiation (from day 0 to day 8). In particular, the comparison of FSHD and control cells at each timepoint of differentiation for the increase of <italic>FRG1 </italic>mRNA level (in relation to the corresponding values at day 0) showed statistically significant results only for FSHD samples at day 1. We then derived the overall kinetics of <italic>FRG1 </italic>expression during myogenic differentiation of FSHD and control cells as median values of <italic>FRG1 </italic>expression at each point of differentiation (days 0, 1, 4 and 8), after the subtraction of the value at day 0 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2c</xref>). This analysis confirmed that in FSHD samples the <italic>FRG1 </italic>transcription at day 1 is significantly upregulated with respect to controls (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2b, c</xref>).

The results obtained for DBE1 and Lsau are summarized in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref> part ii; the results for DBE2 (not shown) were the same as those obtained for DBE1. In myoblasts, the YY1 and Ezh2 Polycomb factors and H3K27me3 were associated with the CarG box-containing sequences (DBE1 and DBE2), but not with Lsau; in myotubes, the Polycomb factors were no longer present in any of the regions (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref> part ii). Furthermore, as with the FRG1 promoter (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1f</xref> part ii), only YY1 binding sites were methylated, regardless of the presence of YY1 binding (before and after myogenic differentiation). Examples of the ChIP analyses of the D4Z4 subregions are shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref> part iii.</p><p>To test the hypothesis that the premature activation of the FRG1 gene during the differentiation of FSHD cells may have been due to a weaker repression mechanism mediated by the contracted D4Z4 allele, we compared H3K27 trimethylation levels in the D4Z4 repeats in control and FSHD myoblasts before and after myogenic differentiation. As shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3b</xref>, the ChIP experiments did not detect any appreciable differences in the H3K27 trimethylation between the healthy controls and FSHD cells. Because of the extensive duplication of D4Z4 sequences in the human genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], the PCR primers used were not 4q specific (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>), and so the results refer to all of the D4Z4 sequences in the nucleus. It is therefore possible that a difference in D4Z4 H3K27 methylation between normal and FSHD cells (attributable to the fewer D4Z4 repeats in the contracted allele) may lead to a variation that is too small to be detected by the ChIP assay. However, ChIP experiments using monochromosomal cell hybrids retaining chromosome 4 indicate the presence of H3K27 trimethylation and YY1 on DBE sequences (D. Cabianca and D. Gabellini, personal communication, Division of Regenerative Medicine San Raffaele Scientific Institute DIBIT, Milan, Italy); moreover, MeDIP DNA methylation experiments using monochromosomal cell hybrids retaining chromosomes 4, 10 and acrocentrics show that only the DBE sequences on chromosome 4 and 10 are methylated (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4b</xref>).</p><p>Furthermore, myogenic differentiation triggered the chromatin remodeling of the D4Z4 sequences as a whole and induced a significant reduction in the Polycomb signals (H3K27me3, YY1 and Ezh2) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3a</xref> part iii). Taken together these results suggest that 4q D4Z4 repeats may be represented in samples immunoprecipitated by H3K27me3, YY1 and Ezh2 antibodies. However, as the primer pairs used amplify DBE sequences from many chromosomes (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>), the obtained ChIP signals might also derive from genomic localizations of D4Z4 other than 4q. Since ChIP experiments do not provide direct evidence on the chromatin structure of the 4q D4Z4 array in myoblasts or on the presence of differences between healthy and FSHD cells, we used 3D fluorescence <italic>in situ </italic>hybridization (3D-FISH) as a complementary strategy.</p><p>To identify the 4q subtelomere, we used a cocktail of three DNA probes: two were bacterial artificial chromosomes (BACs) of the FSHD locus, one containing D4Z4 repeats (green in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> part i) and one not overlapping located 130 kb upstream of the D4Z4 array (red in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> parts i and ii) (see Methods for details), and the third was a painting for chromosome 4 territory (blue in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> parts i and ii). We followed their colocalization in order to analyze the nuclear architecture of the FSHD locus (arrows in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref>) and distinguish the two 4q alleles in the nucleus; one 4q allele in almost all FSHD nuclei shows a weaker hybridization signal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>], and this was considered the bona fide contracted allele (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> part ii, arrowheads).

Colocalization with anti-H3K27me3 immunofluorescence (yellow in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> part iii) was observed in 72.4% of the 4q alleles in the healthy cells (examples of negative and positive H3K27me3 colocalization are shown in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> parts iv and v). In particular, the majority of the non-4q D4Z4 signals (mainly attributed to the short arms of acrocentric chromosomes) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] were concentrated in nucleolar subdomains that are known to be H3K27me3 negative [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. In contrast, the FSHD nuclei showed colocalization with H3K27me3 signals in only 38.6% of the 4q alleles (yellow in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> parts vi and vii) (P = 0.0013). The H3K27me3 colocalized signals were attributed mainly to the wild-type allele identified by the larger hybridization spot (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F4">4</xref> part ii). The observed reduction in the colocalization of H3K27me3 signals and contracted alleles may have been due to the fact that the FSHD alleles give smaller FISH spots, thus preventing us from concluding that the contracted alleles were H3K27 hypomethylated; nevertheless, the different size of the spot undoubtedly reflects a different concentration of H3K27me3 in that subregion of the FSHD nucleus. This experiment, which allows the direct visualization of the tridimensional chromatin structure in vivo, revealed that the majority of D4Z4 sequences modified by H3K27me3 belonged to the array on chromosome 4; moreover, we detected significant differences between the patients and controls that cannot be detected by high resolution PCR-based techniques such as ChIP. Paradoxically, when working with highly repeated DNA sequences clustered on several chromosomes, it is essential to use an approach that distinguishes the genomic derivations of the signals in order to be able to monitor differences attributable to a specific chromosomal locus (that is to say, the D4Z4 array on chromosome 4q) even with a low-resolution technique.</p></sec><sec><title>A specific 4q D4Z4-mediated chromatin loop involving the FRG1 promoter is dynamically regulated during human myoblast differentiation</title><p>It has been recently demonstrated that the formation of higher order structures is a powerful mechanism coordinating the expression of distant loci in the genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].

We also designed two baits specific for DUX4c <italic>Pvu</italic>II fragments (C1 and C2). A total of 16 preys (F series) were positioned flanking the <italic>Pvu</italic>II sites in the <italic>FRG1 </italic>genomic region (see schema in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5a</xref>), and an additional 5 proximal to the D1 baits (1 to 5 in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5a</xref>) were used to confirm that interactions between D1 and the nearby <italic>Pvu</italic>II restriction fragments were quantitatively detected (an index validating the quality of a 3C assay). We measured the crosslinking frequencies between these baits and the various <italic>Pvu</italic>II sites throughout the FSHD locus. D1 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5b</xref>) and D2 (not shown) showed one intrachromosomal loop between the D4Z4 array and the <italic>FRG1 </italic>promoter (F7) in human myoblasts, and two additional interactions with the TUBB4q gene (F16 and F18).

In striking contrast to the presence of long-range associations between D4Z4, <italic>FRG1 </italic>and the <italic>TUBB4q </italic>in undifferentiated myoblasts, myogenic differentiation led to an almost complete loss of the interaction with the <italic>FRG1 </italic>promoter (<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.05 in all cases, see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S6">6b, c</xref> for examples), and the locus acquired a more relaxed conformation; conversely, the interaction between D4Z4 and <italic>TUBB4q </italic>did not seem to be affected by the differentiation process (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5b</xref>). The same 3C analysis of a monochromosomal cell hybrid retaining human chromosome 4 gave similar results (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S7">7b</xref>), thus demonstrating that the loops were formed between sequence elements localized on chromosome 4.</p><p>To investigate whether DUX4c could also mediate similar interactions, we set up a 3C analysis using the C1 and C2 baits described above. The use of C1 revealed an interaction between the <italic>FRG1 </italic>promoter and the DUX4c fragment that did not change during differentiation (Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S7">7c</xref>), whereas no interactions were revealed by C2 (not shown). Notably, the relative crosslinking frequency was one order of magnitude lower with the DUX4c bait than with the D4Z4 baits (compare F7-D1 with F7-C1 in Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5b</xref>, and Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S7">7c</xref>).</p><p>As the expression of the <italic>FRG1 </italic>gene is misregulated in FSHD cells (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), we investigated whether the D4Z4 contraction affects loop formation by making the same 3C analysis of FSHD myoblasts and myotubes, but we did not find any significant differences from controls (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5b</xref>). However, reasoning that the wild-type allele may mask a possible small reduction in the frequency of the interactions, we used a 3C quantitative PCR (3C-qPCR) assay in order to determine the crosslinking frequencies of the F7-D1 interaction more accurately [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. We designed a TaqMan probe complementary to the <italic>FRG1 </italic>promoter of the hybrid fragment generated by 3C, and normalized the 3C-qPCR results following the same procedures as those used for the other 3C-PCRs (that is to say, normalization by digestion, ligation and crosslinking efficiency). This time, there was a slight but statistical significant reduction in the interaction frequency of the FSHD myoblasts (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F5">5c</xref>). However, it is possible that a difference in the D4Z4-<italic>FRG1 </italic>interaction between normal and FSHD cells (attributable to the fewer D4Z4 repeats in the contracted allele) may lead to a variation that is too small to be detected by the 3C assay. These findings suggest that the FSHD locus in muscle cells is structured into at least three intrachromosomal loops: two steady loops connecting D4Z4-<italic>TUBB4q</italic>, and one dynamic loop between D4Z4 and the <italic>FRG1 </italic>promoter that is relaxed during myogenic differentiation. This indicates that the higher order structure of these elements undergoes dynamic remodeling, which probably correlates with the disappearance of the Polycomb complex from both the <italic>FRG1 </italic>promoter and the D4Z4 array, and is concomitant with the upregulation of gene expression. Moreover, the ability to form loops between the <italic>FRG1 </italic>promoter and the D4Z4 array seems to be less efficient in FSHD myoblasts than in controls.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Facioscapulohumeral dystrophy is considered an epigenetic disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].

FRG1P is a nuclear protein that is thought to be involved in RNA processing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]. Slight differences in the cell levels of regulatory proteins such as FRG1P may affect a number of factors and have multiple effects on cell physiology. For instance, the alternative splicing of muscle-specific genes is abnormally regulated in mice overexpressing <italic>FRG1 </italic>and showing an FSHD phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], and so inappropriate regulation of <italic>FRG1 </italic>during the early phases of muscle differentiation may have serious effects on the formation of muscle fiber. We suggest that <italic>FRG1 </italic>misregulation in a specific window of muscle differentiation may contribute to FSHD, although it cannot be considered the only molecular defect causing the FSHD phenotype: for example, the transcription of DUX4 recently observed in FSHD myoblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] may contribute to the manifestation of FSHD.</p><p>In order to investigate the molecular basis of the <italic>FRG1 </italic>transcriptional alteration, we made a detailed analysis of the chromatin structure of two DNA regions residing in the FSHD locus in a human model of myogenic differentiation: the candidate gene <italic>FRG1 </italic>and the D4Z4 array, to which the genetic mutation underlying the disease has been mapped. These two DNA regions were studied at different levels of the epigenome, from DNA methylation and histone code modifications to higher order structures. In this regard, it is important to point out the intrinsic limitation of molecularly analyzing repetitive DNA elements, and so we used the complementary approaches of ChIP and 3D-FISH analysis to gain insights into the chromatin structure of D4Z4.</p><p>The analyses showed that the FSHD locus undergoes chromatin remodeling during myogenic differentiation. In normal myoblasts, the <italic>FRG1 </italic>gene is repressed and its promoter physically interacts with the D4Z4 array; upon differentiation, the Polycomb complex dissociates from the <italic>FRG1 </italic>promoter and the <italic>FRG1 </italic>gene is expressed. Like the <italic>FRG1 </italic>promoter, D4Z4 chromatin also shows the presence of the Polycomb complex and H3K27me3 in myoblasts, and their loss in myotubes; moreover, D4Z4 and the <italic>FRG1 </italic>promoter physically interact in myoblasts, whereas this chromatin loop is relaxed upon myogenic differentiation.</p><p>These data support the hypothesis that the 4q D4Z4 array may have a regulatory effect on <italic>FRG1 </italic>expression, which we suggest is due to their physical association in the nucleus. It has recently been demonstrated that Polycomb occupancy can repress transcription by maintaining a series of long-range chromatin interactions that are lost when mammalian cells differentiate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], and so it would be interesting to investigate directly the involvement of the Polycomb repressor complex as a mediator of the <italic>FRG1</italic>-D4Z4 chromatin loop in myoblasts.</p><p>Chromatin characterization of <italic>FRG1 </italic>and the D4Z4 array in FSHD myoblasts revealed a reduction in H3K27me3 on the contracted D4Z4 allele, and a kinetic analysis of Polycomb dissociation during differentiation that was very similar to that observed in the control cells. The reduction in H3K27me3 may be due to the decrease in the number of D4Z4 units or to hypomethylation of the residual repeats. Furthermore, the early expression of <italic>FRG1 </italic>in differentiating FSHD myoblasts may indicate that muscle cells, like their non-muscle counterparts, require the recruitment of additional factors in order to activate <italic>FRG1 </italic>expression.</p><p>In our cell system, the regulation of <italic>FRG1 </italic>expression therefore seems to be preferentially conditioned by the chromatin structure of the region (that is to say, the strength of the loop between the <italic>FRG1 </italic>promoter and the D4Z4 array related to its chromatin structure). We found a slight reduction in the frequency of loop formation between the D4Z4 array and the <italic>FRG1 </italic>promoter in FSHD myoblasts in comparison with control cells. D4Z4 contraction in FSHD cells may qualitatively alter the repressive effect of this chromatin loop affecting the correct timing of <italic>FRG1 </italic>expression. It is possible that relaxed looping in the presence of protein factors that may induce further changes in chromatin conformation and/or more efficient transcription allows the expression of the <italic>FRG1 </italic>gene. Nonetheless, the observed reduction in the frequency of loop formation between the D4Z4 array and the <italic>FRG1 </italic>promoter in FSHD myoblasts is too small to certainly infer its involvement in the misregulation of <italic>FRG1 </italic>gene expression, and thus further experiments are required to link macrosatellite contraction and gene expression.</p><p>Pirozhokova <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>] published a 3C analysis of the FSHD locus and described the formation of loops between DUX4c and the <italic>FRG1 </italic>promoter. We detected the same loop in myoblasts, although the frequency of the interaction was one order of magnitude lower than that of the loop between <italic>FRG1 </italic>and D4Z4 sequences. The same authors also found a second loop between a telomeric element downstream of the D4Z4 array (the 4qA/B marker) and the <italic>FRG1 </italic>promoter only in FSHD myoblasts, and suggested that this element may enhance the transcription of the gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. As we did not detect <italic>FRG1 </italic>up regulation in FSHD myoblasts, we suggest that the interaction with the 4qA/B marker have the proposed effect of transcription enhancement on <italic>FRG1 </italic>expression only when myogenic differentiation is triggered. Our data, together with data of Petrov <italic>et al</italic>. and Pirozhokova <italic>et al</italic>. indicate that the tridimensional structure of the FSHD region is functional for the expression of the <italic>FRG</italic>1 gene, and probably more than one sequence elements (for example, D4Z4, DUX4c, MAR region) could contribute to the fine regulation of gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>].</p><p>Finally, our model may also explain the manifestation of FSHD in the absence of D4Z4 contraction, as in the case of phenotypic FSHD in which a wild-type 4q D4Z4 array is strongly hypomethylated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In this case, D4Z4 hypomethylation may impair the Polycomb recruitment that leads to a reduction in H3K27 trimethylation, the same molecular defect that we observed in contracted 4q alleles.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The results of this study provide the first demonstration of a mechanistic link between the D4Z4 array and the transcriptional regulation of muscle-specific <italic>FRG1 </italic>via intrachromosomal looping. This finding may predict a broader role of the D4Z4 array in coordinating regulatory interactions between non-contiguous elements in the genome. The identification of such <italic>in cis </italic>or <italic>in trans </italic>interactions may untangle the intricate cascade of events underlying the manifestation of FSHD and may suggest that this human disorder is an example of the structural modification of the epigenome.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Cell cultures, immunofluorescence</title><p>Human primary myoblasts from healthy donors and FSHD patients were obtained from the Telethon BioBank, (Neuromuscular Diseases and Neuroimmunology Unit, Muscle Cell Biology Laboratory, C.
