The highly varied outcomes of such integration processes undoubtedly depend at least in part upon variations among the gene expression programs of individual progenitor cells. To date, there has not been a comprehensive examination of these differences among progenitor cells of a particular tissue. Here, we used comprehensive gene expression profiling to define these differences among individual progenitor cells of the vertebrate retina. Retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) have been shown by lineage analysis to be multipotent throughout development and to produce distinct types of daughter cells in a temporal, conserved order. A total of 42 single RPCs were profiled on Affymetrix arrays. <italic>In situ</italic> hybridizations performed on both retinal sections and dissociated retinal cells were used to validate the results of the microarrays. An extensive amount of heterogeneity in gene expression among RPCs, even among cells isolated from the same developmental time point, was observed. While many classes of genes displayed heterogeneity of gene expression, the expression of transcription factors constituted a significant amount of the observed heterogeneity. In contrast to previous findings, individual RPCs were found to express multiple bHLH transcription factors, suggesting alternative models to those previously developed concerning how these factors may be coordinated. Additionally, the expression of cell cycle related transcripts showed differences among those associated with G2 and M, versus G1 and S phase, suggesting different levels of regulation for these genes. These data provide insights into the types of processes and genes that are fundamental to cell fate choices, proliferation decisions, and, for cells of the central nervous system, the underpinnings of the formation of complex circuitry.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="23"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>One key question in developmental biology is how progenitor cells, cells that are still dividing and have not as yet chosen any particular cellular fate, are specified to generate a precise set of cell types. In the nervous system, this question is of further interest, since the formation of the proper neuronal circuitry often depends upon the generation of particular types of neurons in the appropriate location and with the correct timing. The exact mechanisms that control these processes in neural progenitor cells are not well understood at present, but are believed to involve some combination of extrinsic signaling pathways and intrinsic factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001588-Cepko1">&#x0005b;1&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001588-Livesey1">&#x0005b;2&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001588-Edlund1">&#x0005b;3&#x0005d;</xref>. It has been noted that a fairly small number of signaling pathways are used iteratively in development, with very different outcomes, not only across tissues, but even within a single developing tissue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001588-Nagaraj1">&#x0005b;4&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001588-Voas1">&#x0005b;5&#x0005d;</xref>. The distinct outcomes must be in large part due to differences among individual progenitor cells. However, to date, there has not been a comprehensive analysis of the differences among progenitor cells within any developing tissue. There have been a few studies that have begun to examine gene expression at a single cell level, but they were constrained either due to the small number of genes sampled <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001588-Chiang1">&#x0005b;6&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001588-Ginsberg1">&#x0005b;7&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001588-Kamme1">&#x0005b;8&#x0005d;</xref> or due to the small number of cells profiled <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001588-Tietjen1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001588-Ramos1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. Without an approach that involves a full complement of transcripts and many more cells, one cannot gain an appreciation of the contribution of progenitor cell heterogeneity to the production of the many types of progeny cells within a tissue. Beyond the obvious interest in this question for developmental biologists, therapeutic strategies reliant upon stem cells will need such information to direct stem cells into particular progenitor cell states.</p><p>The vertebrate retina has served as a model system for the development of the central nervous system (CNS). Although it contains only six major neuronal cell types and one glial cell type <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001588-Rodieck1">&#x0005b;11&#x0005d;</xref>, further distinctions among the neurons relevant to circuitry and information transformations show that there is at least 50 types of cells in the mature retina <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001588-Masland1">&#x0005b;12&#x0005d;</xref>. Lineage analyses in several species have shown that these cell types are produced from a pool of multipotent progenitor cells throughout development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001588-Holt1">&#x0005b;13&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001588-Turner1">&#x0005b;14&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001588-Turner2">&#x0005b;15&#x0005d;</xref>, with even terminal divisions capable of giving rise to two very different cell types, such as a photoreceptor cell and an interneuron. &#x0005b;<sup>3</sup>H&#x0005d;-thymidine based birthdating studies have demonstrated that these retinal cell types are generated in overlapping intervals and with a conserved birth order <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001588-Sidman1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001588-Young1">&#x0005b;17&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001588-Young2">&#x0005b;18&#x0005d;</xref>. The major output neuron, the retinal ganglion cell, is the first to be generated, followed by the onset of cone photoreceptor and horizontal cell (an interneuron) genesis shortly thereafter (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001588-Altshuler1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>). The appearance of another type of interneuron, the amacrine cell, occurs slightly later still, with rod photoreceptor cells, bipolar cells (another interneuron type) and Muller glia being the latest born retinal cell types (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001588-Altshuler1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>The classical studies cited above set the stage for further analyses of RPCs.

Included within this population were newborn neurons, as well as a few neurons further along in their differentiation program. The transcriptomes from these cells were used to classify each cell as an RPC, a cell in transition between an RPC and a neuron, or a neuron. In total, 64 cells were profiled on Affymetrix mouse 430 2.0 oligonucleotide arrays, encompassing 36 RPCs, 6 transitional cells and 22 neurons. Examination of the gene expression profiles from these cells revealed an extensive amount of heterogeneity among RPCs, even among those RPCs isolated from the same day of development. In particular, transcription factors were responsible for a significant amount of the observed heterogeneity. Cell cycle regulators also accounted for some of the differences in gene expression among RPCs. Interestingly, genes that have been more associated with the G2 phase of the cell cycle displayed more heterogeneity than those that have been linked with the G1 phase, pointing to possible differences in how these genes are regulated. A more in depth examination of the G2 RPCs revealed additional genes that may be correlated with the production of postmitotic neurons from RPCs. Surprisingly, it appears that different RPCs might be using different genes to regulate exit from the cell cycle. <italic>In situ</italic> hybridizations on retinal cryosections and dissociated retinal cells allowed for validation and quantitative extension of the observed heterogeneity in the microarray data. The results from this study provide the most comprehensive and in depth examination of dynamic gene expression patterns of individual cells in a developing tissue, and suggest that progenitor cell heterogeneity plays a major role in the production of the distinct cell types comprising complex tissues.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Single cell collection and PCR based cDNA amplification</title><p>Single retinal cells were isolated, their mRNAs were reverse transcribed, and the resulting cDNAs were PCR amplified exactly as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001588-Trimarchi1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>.

In addition, almost all of the ganglion cells, horizontal cells, and cone photoreceptors are born during these timepoints and many rod photoreceptors and amacrine cells are generated as well (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001588-Altshuler1">&#x0005b;19&#x0005d;</xref>)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001588-Young3">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>.

These birthdating experiments indicate that cells isolated between E12.5 and P0 can hypothetically capture the gene expression programs in RPCs that lead to the generation of all the retinal cell types, as well as the gene expression profiles of many of the maturing retinal cell types.</p><p>The retinas were dissected and dissociated to individual cells using papain and single cells were harvested using a capillary pipette drawn into a fine needle (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Materials and Methods</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001588-Trimarchi1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref> for more details). Since retinal cells at these early stages of development do not show definitive morphology, cells were chosen at random and the post hoc strategy described below was used to retrospectively classify the cells as RPCs, transitional cells, or postmitotic neurons. The isolated single cells were lysed and subjected to a 35 cycle RT-PCR based protocol that was previously shown to generate a sufficient amount of cDNA (10&#x02013;20 &#x000b5;g) for hybridization on Affymetrix microarrays <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001588-Tietjen1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001588-Trimarchi1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001588-Brady1">&#x0005b;43&#x0005d;</xref>. Additionally, medium samples were removed from the dish containing the dissociated cells and subjected to the same RT-PCR method to control for the presence of cDNAs from lysed cells within the media.</p><p>The quality of the resulting single cell cDNA products was assessed using several methods. First, the cDNA was examined on an agarose gel and those preparations that contained products ranging from 500 bp to 2 kb were subjected to further testing (data not shown). Media controls consistently failed to exhibit significant cDNA smears (data not shown). To further evaluate the quality of the single cell cDNA mixtures, gene specific RT-PCR was performed using three genes known to be highly expressed in the developing retina (<italic>pax6</italic>, <italic>chx10</italic> and <italic>cyclin D1</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001588-Blackshaw1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001588-Sicinski1">&#x0005b;44&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001588-Liu1">&#x0005b;45&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001588-Walther1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>. Robust bands were detected in those preparations that displayed the most robust cDNA smears and bands were routinely not observed with the media controls (data not shown). One final, more comprehensive, approach was utilized to assess the single cell cDNAs. Ten micrograms of cDNA were labeled with Cy5 and hybridized to cDNA microarrays spotted in our laboratory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001588-Livesey2">&#x0005b;28&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001588-Punzo1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>. These microarrays contained &#x0223c;12,000 ESTs derived from the retina (Bento Soares, University of Iowa) and many retinal expressed genes from our laboratory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001588-Punzo1">&#x0005b;47&#x0005d;</xref>. Many of the transcripts spotted on these cDNA microarrays showed significant signal when hybridized with cDNA from the single cells, whereas amplifications from media controls did not show signals above background (data not shown). Taken together, these data demonstrated that more than 50&#x00025; of isolated single retinal cells yielded cDNA of sufficient quantity and quality for more complete gene expression profiling on Affymetrix microarrays.</p><p>Ten micrograms of cDNA from each single cell to be profiled was DNase treated, labeled with biotinylated ddATP using TdT, and hybridized to Affymetrix mouse 430 2.0 oligonucleotide arrays using standard Affymetrix protocols (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Materials and Methods</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001588-Tietjen1">&#x0005b;9&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001588-Trimarchi1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref> for full details). These arrays allowed over 34,000 transcripts, nearly the entire mouse transcriptome, to be potentially sampled for expression in each single cell. The data were collected and normalized using Affymetrix Microarray software (MAS 5.0). For each probe set on the array, signal levels, present/absent calls, and detection p-values were exported to Microsoft Excel (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001588.s005">Table S1</xref>). In addition, the Affymetrix data files for each single cell profiled in this study have been deposited in the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/</ext-link>) and are accessible through GEO series accession numbers GSE9811 and GSE9812.</p><p>In order to gain an appreciation for the level of noise, or unexpected signals, in the single cell preparations, the signals for genes predicted <underline>not</underline> to be expressed within retinal cells were examined. Signals for immunoglobulin genes (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;7), cytokeratins (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;36), and muscle genes (n&#x0200a;&#x0003d;&#x0200a;9) were examined. Signal levels were almost invariably &#x0003c;1000 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001588.s006">Table S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001588.s001">Figure S1</xref>) and were correspondingly denoted as absent by the Affymetrix algorithm. For the five genes that showed significant signal, signal was not present in very many cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001588.s006">Table S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001588.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Since previous work on these genes did not assess retinal expression, it was not clear whether these signals were due to transcriptional activity of these loci in the retina, or were false positives due to the single cell method. Examination of SAGE tags for these genes showed that expression was detected for 2 of these 5 genes, suggesting that at least in these cases, there was bona fide retinal expression. To further assess the robustness of the single cell data, the levels of housekeeping genes were examined. It was not clear which genes should be used for this test, as several studies have demonstrated that housekeeping gene expression is highly variable, as assayed by microarray <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001588-Lee1">&#x0005b;48&#x0005d;</xref>, SAGE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001588-Blackshaw1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001588-Kouadjo1">&#x0005b;49&#x0005d;</xref>, or other profiling methods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001588-Thellin1">&#x0005b;50&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001588-Steele1">&#x0005b;51&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001588-AlBader1">&#x0005b;52&#x0005d;</xref>.

Nonetheless, a list of control genes for RNA preparations generated by two commercial vendors (Qiagen and Superarray Bioscience) was used for this test (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001588.s007">Table S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001588.s002">Figure S2</xref>).

However, while each of the genes was present in at least one single cell, for several of them there was a great deal of variability in their expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001588.s007">Table S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001588.s002">Figure S2</xref>). It was not the case that a particular cell expressed low levels of all of these genes, as might be predicted for a poor cDNA preparation. Even within a single cell, a high degree of variability in the level of signal for individual genes was observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001588.s002">Figure S2</xref>). These data are consistent with the observations made using total tissue preparations, and thus are not a result of the single cell method. It is more likely the case that assumptions about consistent expression levels of many housekeeping genes are incorrect.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Retinal progenitor cell classification</title><p>The main goal of this study was the determination of the degree of heterogeneity in gene expression among individual RPCs. The first step in this process was to identify a particular transcriptional profile as arising from a cycling RPC instead of a postmitotic retinal neuron. To accomplish this, a post hoc classification scheme was devised based upon clusters of co-expressed genes that were centered around previously identified markers of RPCs, RGCs, ACs or rod photoreceptors. Cone photoreceptors and horizontal cells were excluded as none of the single cell profiles examined appeared to have originated from either of these cell types, following inspection of the array profiles for markers of these cell types. This result was not surprising as both cell types are quite rare <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001588-Young3">&#x0005b;41&#x0005d;</xref>. The validity of this classification scheme was first tested on the set of cells containing developing RGCs, ACs, and PRs since these cells had already been extensively characterized <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001588-Trimarchi1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><p>To classify a particular single cell as a developing RGC based upon its gene expression profile, genes strongly associated with the RGC marker <italic>neurofilament light</italic> (<italic>NF68</italic>) were determined. The single cell expression profiles used to generate this list of genes included the potential RPCs profiled for this study, developing RGCs and ACs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001588-Trimarchi1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>, single mature bipolar cells (Kim et al., in press), single mature amacrine cells (Cherry et al., in preparation) and single mature M&#x000fc;ller glia (Roesch et al., in press). Using a Fisher's exact test (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Materials and Methods</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001588-Trimarchi1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>), the probability that there was a correlation between the distribution of any given gene and <italic>NF68</italic> was calculated. Setting a p-value cutoff of 10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup> yielded 81 genes highly associated with <italic>NF68</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001588.s008">Table S4</xref>). Many genes previously shown to have significant RGC expression, such as <italic>GAP43</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001588-Trimarchi1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>, were included in this list. At least one gene known to be expressed in RGCs, <italic>Brn3b</italic>, was not found to be strongly associated with <italic>NF68</italic>. The reason for the absence of an association between these two genes most likely is that temporally <italic>Brn3b</italic> is turned on in newborn RGCs prior to <italic>NF68</italic>. In fact, two of the RPCs (E14 cell B1 and E16 cell F1) identified as transitional cells in the process of deciding upon a final fate (see below) possessed significant levels of <italic>Brn3b</italic>, but were devoid of <italic>NF68</italic>. Since all of the cells profiled in this study were isolated during retinal development, genes with such temporally distinct windows of expression would not necessarily be expected to associate together. However, <italic>NF68</italic> and <italic>Brn3b</italic> were strongly associated by hierarchical clustering <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001588-Trimarchi1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref>. This lack of correlation again demonstrates the increased utility of the Fisher's exact test over other clustering methods for analyzing gene expression data from single cells.</p><p>The relative expression levels for each of the 81 genes associated strongly with <italic>NF68</italic> (as well as <italic>NF68</italic> itself) were calculated by dividing the signal from each single cell by the maximum signal for that gene across the entire data set of single cells. The scaled values for each of the 82 genes within each cell were summed. All sums were then scaled, so that the maximum score was 10, to generate an RGC score for each single cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001588-g001">Figure 1</xref>). This operation was carried out for markers of all cell types on all cells, as described further below. Scaling of the summed scores was required due to the fact that, for each cell type (below), the number of genes defining that cell type differed. An examination of the scores for the 13 previously characterized developing RGCs revealed that, for 12 of these cells the RGC score was considerably higher than the RPC, AC or PR score (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001588-g001">Figure 1</xref>). For one cell, E14 cell E1, the RPC score and the RGC score were almost the same. Since this cell was a developing RGC and not isolated from adult tissue, the most likely explanation for this result is that this is a cell that was transitioning from an RPC to an RGC. This cell added to the six RPCs designated as transitioning means a total of 7 cells were identified as transitional cells, those having characteristic gene expression of multiple cell types, and these will be discussed in more detail below.</p><fig id="pone-0001588-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0001588.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Classification of Retinal Progenitor Cells.</title><p>A classification scheme was developed to identify RPCs, RGCs, ACs and rod photoreceptors based on the expression of gene clusters.

Using these sets of associated genes to generate classification scores revealed that 4 out of 4 rod photoreceptor cells (2 adult and 2 P0) had significantly higher PR scores than the RGCs and ACs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001588-g001">Figure 1</xref>).

The distribution of <italic>cyclin D1</italic> expression was compared pairwise to the signal levels for every other gene on the array across 128 single cell profiles in exactly the same manner as for the RGC, AC and PR markers.

Therefore, to improve the classification of cycling RPCs, additional gene clusters were added to generate a composite RPC score.</p><p>To generate a composite RPC classification score, three additional genes (<italic>Fgf15</italic>, <italic>Sfrp2</italic> and <italic>&#x003bc;-crystallin</italic>) were chosen to generate gene clusters.

These 3 genes were also chosen as they together accommodate some of the temporal heterogeneity of the RPCs, as described below. Using the Fisher's exact test and a cutoff p-value of 10<sup>&#x02212;3</sup> as before, associated genes were identified for each of these three genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001588.s011">Table S7</xref>). The relative expression levels were calculated and scaled RPC scores generated. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001588-g001">Figure 1</xref>, 42 cells displayed a significant RPC score. For 36 of these cells, this score was considerably higher than that for RGC, AC, or PR, establishing these single cell profiles as coming from cycling RPCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001588-g001">Figure 1</xref>). For the additional 6 cells (denoted with an &#x0002a; in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001588-g001">Figure 1</xref> and E14 cell E1, see above), while the RPC was the highest, at least one other classification score was significant as well. These cells are most likely transitional cells, RPCs that are in the process of generating a postmitotic daughter and a full analysis of their gene expression will be presented elsewhere (Trimarchi and Cepko, in preparation). Since transcripts expressed in RPCs would not be expected to disappear immediately, it was predicted that some cells would possess profiles containing genes expressed in one or more neuronal cell types, together with RPC genes that are in the process of being downregulated. Such transitional cells are of interest as they provide a window into cells that might still be in the process of deciding upon a final fate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001588-Ezzeddine1">&#x0005b;54&#x0005d;</xref>. If this state was plastic, it might be revealed through the expression of markers of multiple neuronal cell types.</p><p>To assess the utility of this classification scheme relative to a more classical method, the 42 RPC single cell profiles were clustered with the 23 developing or mature RGCs, ACs and PRs using hierarchical clustering. The genes used for hierarchical clustering of these cells were those shown by the Fisher's exact test to be most closely associated with <italic>Cyclin D1</italic>, <italic>Fgf15</italic>, <italic>Sfrp2</italic>, <italic>Crym</italic>, <italic>NF68</italic>, <italic>TCFAP-2&#x003b2;</italic>, and <italic>Nrl</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001588.s008">Tables S4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001588.s009">S5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001588.s010">S6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001588.s011">S7</xref>). Hierarchical clustering of these cells showed a definitive separation between the developing neurons and the RPCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001588.s003">Figure S3</xref>). Additionally, the PRs were distinct from the RGCs and ACs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001588.s003">Figure S3</xref>). However, the hierarchical clustering method could not distinguish the RGCs from the ACs, whereas the devised classification scheme did, at least for certain AC types, as noted above. A further benefit of this classification scheme over the hierarchical clustering was its ability to identify transitional cells, as the hierarchical clustering did not distinguish these particular RPCs from any others. Additionally, the hierarchical clustering separated the RPCs into several subgroups, one of which contained mainly RPCs isolated at P0. This separation was based upon the cluster of genes that associated strongly with <italic>&#x003bc;-crystallin</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001588.s011">Table S7</xref>) and were expressed only in RPCs during later timepoints (see below). However, two RPCs isolated from earlier timepoints (E12 cell A4 and E13 cell A8) were placed into this cluster by the clustering program despite the fact that these cells did not express this cluster of genes. This observation, coupled with the inability of the hierarchical clustering algorithm to discern RGC profiles from AC profiles makes it difficult to interpret the significance of any further subdivisions of the RPCs.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Classical and new markers of RPCs</title><p>Immunohistochemistry and/or ISH are standard techniques used to determine the distribution of particular cell types. However, these methods cannot resolve the simultaneous expression of a large number of genes, which would allow one to determine how often it was that a particular cell expressed all or most of the known markers used to define that cell type. The single cell profiles for RPCs were thus examined to determine the distribution of classical markers of RPCs in the single cell profiles.

Confirmation of expression in RPCs was possible on section ISH since RPCs reside in a distinctive layer, the outer neuroblastic layer (ONBL), though they are not the only cell type in the ONBL as migrating neurons also are present in this layer. In addition, expression of a gene in an RPC is detectable in cells acutely labeled with &#x0005b;<sup>3</sup>H&#x0005d;-thymidine, using the quantitative method of dissociated ISH (DISH). ISH using a <italic>cyclin D1</italic> riboprobe on retinal cryosections from E12.5, E16.5 and P0 revealed strong staining in the ONBL, and diminished staining in the inner neuroblastic layer (INBL), where most postmitotic neurons are located (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001588-g002">Figure 2B&#x02013;D</xref>). DISH was performed on dissociated retinas that had been incubated with &#x0005b;<sup>3</sup>H&#x0005d;-thymidine for 1 hour before dissociation. This method primarily labels cells in S-phase and to a minor degree, cells in the early portion of G2. DISH performed at E16.5 or P0 with a <italic>cyclin D1</italic> riboprobe showed that greater than 90&#x00025; of &#x0005b;<sup>3</sup>H&#x0005d;-thymidine<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells were also <italic>cyclin D1</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001588-g003">Figure 3A,C</xref>), indicating that most S-phase progenitor cells express <italic>cyclin D1</italic>.

Additionally, only &#x0223c;1/3 of <italic>cyclin D1</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells were &#x0005b;<sup>3</sup>H&#x0005d;-thymidine<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001588-g003">Figure 3A,C</xref>), consistent with the microarray data that suggested that <italic>cyclin D1</italic> was present in RPCs in other cell cycle phases, as well as S phase. DISH for other genes broadly expressed in RPCs showed that 93&#x00025; of &#x0005b;<sup>3</sup>H&#x0005d;-thymidine<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells at E16.5 expressed <italic>Pax6</italic> and 93&#x00025; of &#x0005b;<sup>3</sup>H&#x0005d;-thymidine<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells expressed <italic>Chx10</italic>. It should be noted that the microarray data reflects expression patterns of RPCs in all cell cycle phases, not just S phase, so an exact match of the percentage of RPCs positive for a given gene in the microarray analysis would not necessarily be expected in the &#x0005b;<sup>3</sup>H&#x0005d;-thymidine/DISH experiments. Nonetheless, these data demonstrate that a very high percentage of at least S phase RPCs express these genes. At the same time, they also show that a clear minority of &#x0005b;<sup>3</sup>H&#x0005d;-thymidine<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells was negative for these RPC markers. This finding corroborates the microarray results, where not all RPCs were positive for these RPC marker genes (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001588-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Although the possibility exists that the &#x0005b;<sup>3</sup>H&#x0005d;-thymidine<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> population does not appear to be 100&#x00025; for these genes for technical reasons, DISH performed for <italic>Ubiquitin B</italic> at E16.5 did show that 100&#x00025; of the &#x0005b;<sup>3</sup>H&#x0005d;-thymidine<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells expressed <italic>Ubiquitin B</italic>, demonstrating that at least for one probe this degree of co-staining was achievable. Taken together, these data indicate that most, but not all, RPCs do indeed express classical markers of RPCs at all times. The mild degree of heterogeneity observed likely reflects some dynamic processes within these cells. A similar suggestion was made based upon observations of the expression of a transgene encoded by a Chx10 BAC, in which the onset of expression was not uniform throughout the retina <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001588-Rowan1">&#x0005b;58&#x0005d;</xref>.</p><fig id="pone-0001588-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0001588.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Examination of broadly expressed RPC genes by dissociated cell <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (DISH).</title><p>DISH was performed using either <italic>Cyclin D1</italic> or <italic>Fgf15</italic> probes.

To identify such genes, three different approaches were used. First, the RPC genes identified using the Fisher's exact test that were used for classifying the single cells were examined. Second, hierarchical clustering was performed on the set of single cells including the 42 RPCs and the 21 developing neurons previously characterized <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001588-Trimarchi1">&#x0005b;36&#x0005d;</xref> using Gene Cluster software <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001588-Eisen1">&#x0005b;37&#x0005d;</xref>.

The types of genes identified ranged from transcription factors (<italic>Plagl1</italic> and <italic>Lhx2</italic>) to secreted molecules (<italic>Fgf15</italic> and <italic>Dkk3</italic>). The presence of these transcripts in many of the RPCs continued to demonstrate the robustness of the single cell profiling method since these genes have been shown to be expressed in the retina by other means <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001588-Blackshaw1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001588-Walther1">&#x0005b;46&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001588-Valente1">&#x0005b;59&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001588-Liu2">&#x0005b;60&#x0005d;</xref>. As observed earlier for genes such as <italic>Sox2</italic> and <italic>Chx10</italic>, these additional RPC genes were broadly expressed throughout individual RPCs (i.e. found in &#x0003e;50&#x00025; of RPCs and in many cases &#x0003e;75&#x00025; of RPCs), but most of these genes also were not observed in all RPCs, displaying some heterogeneity of expression.</p><p>To investigate the heterogeneous expression of the newly identified broadly expressed RPC markers, section ISH and DISH were performed for one such gene, <italic>Fgf15</italic>. According to the microarray data, <italic>Fgf15</italic> was expressed in 9 out of 11 <italic>cyclin D1</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> E12.5 RPCs, 9 out of 11 E16.5 cells and 10 out of 13 P0 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001588-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Section ISH was performed at E12.5, E16.5 and P0. <italic>Fgf15</italic> was expressed in the ONBL at E12.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001588-g002">Figure 2E</xref>) and E16.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001588-g002">Figure 2F</xref>), but was already less intense in the center of the retina at E16.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001588-g002">Figure 2F</xref>), despite the continued presence of RPCs at this stage. By P0, strong staining for <italic>Fgf15</italic> was only observed in the most peripheral portion of the ONBL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001588-g002">Figure 2G</xref>). At all of the timepoints observed, it appeared that <italic>Fgf15</italic> expression was much patchier than that of <italic>cyclin D1</italic> (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001588-g002">Figure 2B to F</xref>igure 2E for instance), confirming the heterogeneity in <italic>Fgf15</italic> expression. DISH also was performed on E12.5, E16.5 or P0 retinas that had first been labeled for 1 hr with &#x0005b;<sup>3</sup>H&#x0005d;-thymidine. When compared with the results for <italic>cyclin D1</italic>, the percentage of <italic>Fgf15</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells was consistently lower, whether among the entire population of retinal cells or among the &#x0005b;<sup>3</sup>H&#x0005d;-thymidine<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> population (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001588-g003">Figure 3A and 3B</xref>).

Two color DISH on P0 retinal cells revealed that while &#x0003e;90&#x00025; of <italic>Fgf15</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells also expressed <italic>cyclin D1</italic>, only 50&#x00025; of <italic>cyclin D1</italic><sup>&#x0002b;</sup> cells expressed <italic>Fgf15</italic>. The section ISH and DISH provide a confirmation that the heterogeneity of <italic>Fgf15</italic> expression shown in the microarray analysis is unlikely to be a consequence of the single cell method, but reveals bona fide heterogeneity in expression among RPCs, even from a given age and in the same portion of the cell cycle, and even for a gene that is generally broadly expressed in RPCs.</p><p>In addition to the validation of previously characterized RPC markers, the single cell method revealed the expression of new genes broadly expressed in RPCs that were not previously characterized in the retina, such as <italic>tropomyosin 4</italic> (<italic>Tpm4</italic>).

Examining gene clusters generated around <italic>Sfrp2</italic> either by hierarchical clustering methods (data not shown) or by using a Fisher's exact test (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001588.s011">Table S7</xref>) did reveal some genes with correlated expressions in RPCs, but consistently failed to yield genes with a close match for the temporal expression pattern of <italic>Sfrp2</italic>.

Comparing the gene expression profiles of E12.5 RPCs and P0 RPCs by visual inspection in Microsoft Excel, however, did reveal several candidate genes whose expression appeared mainly confined to early RPCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001588-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). There were not a large number of these genes and their expression was restricted to a small subset of the profiled RPCs, unlike <italic>Sfrp2,</italic> which was more broadly expressed in early RPCs. Interestingly, three of these early genes were transcription factors (<italic>Foxp1</italic>, <italic>Etv1</italic> and <italic>Etv6</italic>) and one was a cell signaling molecule (<italic>Fgf3</italic>). To confirm the temporal gene expression pattern of these transcripts, ISH was performed on E12.5, E16.5 and P0 retinal cryosections. These experiments demonstrated that while these genes appeared to be present in fewer cells than <italic>Sfrp2</italic>, the kinetics of their expression did parallel that of <italic>Sfrp2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001588-g004">Figure 4E&#x02013;J</xref> and data not shown). <italic>Fgf3</italic> was the most similar to <italic>Sfrp2</italic> by ISH with significant staining in the ONBL at E12.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001588-g004">Figure 4E</xref>) and staining only in the most peripheral portion of the ONBL by P0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001588-g004">Figure 4G</xref>). However, <italic>Fgf3</italic> staining was more localized toward the center of the retina, while <italic>Sfrp2</italic> staining extended more peripherally (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001588-g004">Figure 4B and 4E</xref>). Given that retinal neurogenesis initiates in the center and spreads to the periphery, this difference in spatial patterns between <italic>Sfrp2</italic> and <italic>Fgf3</italic> may point to roles in the initiation/progression of neurogenesis. In the chick and zebrafish, Fgf3, in conjunction with Fgf8, plays an important role in controlling the onset of neurogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001588-MartinezMorales1">&#x0005b;64&#x0005d;</xref>.

On the Affymetrix mouse 430 2.0 microarray, there were &#x0223c;2400 target sequences annotated as a TF (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.netaffx.com">www.netaffx.com</ext-link>) representing approximately 2000 different TFs. Examination of the array signals for the 42 RPCs revealed that &#x0223c;50&#x00025; of these TFs achieved a present call (&#x0003e;1000) in at least one of the RPCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001588.s004">Figure S4</xref>). Furthermore, &#x0223c;700 of these TFs showed a medium to high level of signal (&#x0003e;5000) in at least one of the 42 RPCs (data not shown). These TFs ranged in their frequency of expression, from those showing expression in nearly all 42 of the RPCs (see top 1/3 of <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001588.s004">Figure S4</xref>) to those displaying extensive heterogeneity of expression (3 or 4 out of 42 RPCs) across the RPCs (lower 2/3 of <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001588.s004">Figure S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001588-g007">Figure 7</xref>). To attempt to discover coregulated sets of TFs, different clustering methods were used, including hierarchical clustering and a Fisher's exact test. However, none of the methods employed was capable of identifying overlapping TFs that behaved in a coordinated manner. There are most likely several reasons for this result. First, some of the TFs are expressed in very few of the profiled RPCs, making it impossible to correlate their expression with any other genes with any statistical reliability. Second, the available algorithms might not be able to account for the combinatorial nature of the action of TFs. For instance, it is possible that when two TFs are expressed together in the same single cell they lead to a certain cellular outcome. However, these same two factors might also be expressed separately in other single cells. A combination of more sophisticated algorithms and functional studies will be necessary to fully understand the extensive heterogeneity of TF expression in developing RPCs.</p><p>Neurogenic basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors have been shown to play crucial roles in the generation of many postmitotic retinal cell types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001588-Vetter1">&#x0005b;75&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001588-Cepko2">&#x0005b;76&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001588-Hatakeyama1">&#x0005b;77&#x0005d;</xref>.

Understanding the mechanism of action of these bHLH factors requires a detailed knowledge of their expression patterns. In the 42 single RPC profiles, the neurogenic bHLH genes were found in subsets of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001588-g007">Figure 7</xref>). To verify that these bHLH factors were expressed in RPCs, retinas were pulse labeled with &#x0005b;<sup>3</sup>H&#x0005d;-thymidine and DISH was performed for <italic>Math5</italic> or <italic>NeuroD1</italic>.

These results indicate that while the bulk of cycling RPCs are not expressing these bHLHs, these genes most likely begin their expression either in late S phase or early G2. Interestingly, when one bHLH transcript was observed in an RPC, other bHLH transcripts were present as well, and some RPCs expressed as many as 4 different bHLH genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001588-g007">Figure 7</xref>). For example, at least three cells at three different timepoints expressed significant levels of <italic>Math5</italic>, <italic>Ngn2</italic> and <italic>NeuroD1</italic> (see E13 cell B3, E16 cell D6 and P0 cell C1).

There were numerous forkhead transcription factors expressed in the single cell profiles of RPCs and many of these TFs showed profound heterogeneity in their expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001588-g004">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001588-g007">7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001588.s004">Figure S4</xref>). These forkhead factors ranged from those for which there is little known about their functional roles in general and nothing understood of their part in retinal development (<italic>Foxj3</italic> and <italic>Foxk2</italic>) to <italic>Foxn4</italic>, which has been shown to play a crucial role in the ability of RPCs to generate amacrine and horizontal cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001588-Li1">&#x0005b;93&#x0005d;</xref>. <italic>Foxm1</italic> was also found in a subset of RPCs and ISH revealed expression of this in the ONBL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001588-g009">Figure 9M&#x02013;O</xref>). Intriguingly, at P0, <italic>Foxm1</italic> was confined to the vitreal side of the ONBL where S phase RPCs are located (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001588-g009">Figure 9O</xref>). In serum starved cells induced to re-enter the cell cycle, <italic>Foxm1</italic> mRNA has been shown to initiate at the onset of S phase and remain on from that point <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001588-Korver1">&#x0005b;94&#x0005d;</xref>. It is interesting that <italic>Foxm1</italic> may be more tightly regulated in the developing retina, but its expression is consistent with a role in cell cycle control. <italic>Foxo3a</italic> was another family member expressed in subsets of RPCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001588-g007">Figure 7</xref>). Although the <italic>Foxo3a</italic> transcript was detected in cells from early and later developmental timepoints, there were more single RPCs expressing this gene at P0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001588-g007">Figure 7</xref>). Section ISH confirmed this later expression, as signal was observed in more cells in the ONBL at P0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001588-g009">Figure 9R</xref>) than at E12.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001588-g009">Figure 9P</xref>). The significance of this <italic>Foxo3a</italic> expression in the retina is unclear.

While it is conceivable that Foxo3a is sensitizing the later retina to apoptotic signals, Foxo transcription factors in general have been linked to the cyclin kinase inhibitor p27Kip1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001588-Huang1">&#x0005b;92&#x0005d;</xref>. Therefore, given that more RPCs at P0 are generating postmitotic daughter cells and p27Kip1 is involved in cell cycle exit in the retina <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001588-Dyer1">&#x0005b;31&#x0005d;</xref>, perhaps Foxo3a plays an upstream role in the decision to generate a postmitotic daughter cell.</p><p>Many additional TF families are present in the single cell profiles, with different family members represented in distinct subsets of RPCs. For instance, there were at least 5 different Kr&#x000fc;ppel-like factors (KLFs) detected in subsets of RPCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001588-g007">Figure 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001588.s004">Figure S4</xref>).

The fact that these KLFs are expressed in RPCs in the mouse is interesting given the important role played by Kr&#x000fc;ppel in the temporal progression of neuroblasts in <italic>Drosophila</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001588-Isshiki1">&#x0005b;24&#x0005d;</xref>. It has also been shown that Castor, the final gene in the Drosophila cascade, is expressed in photoreceptors in mouse retina <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001588-Blackshaw1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>. Further examination of the single cell gene expression profiles revealed the presence of both an <italic>ikaros-like zinc finger</italic> (<italic>Ikzf5</italic>) in subsets of RPCs and several POU domain containing genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001588.s004">Figure S4</xref>). The presence of such homologs for other genes in the Drosophila neuroblast cascade in subsets of RPCs during mouse retinal development suggests that a cascade similar to that in <italic>Drosophila</italic> might be playing a role in the progression of competence states in the murine retina as well.</p><p>One final TF family expressed in subsets of RPC profiles is the nuclear hormone receptor family of gene regulators. Many members of this large family were observed in distinct subsets of RPCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001588.s004">Figure S4</xref>), including both orphan nuclear receptors such as the CoupTFs (<italic>Nr2f1</italic> and <italic>Nr2f2</italic>) and those for which the hormone is characterized such as <italic>RXR&#x003b1;</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001588-g007">Figure 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001588-g010">10A&#x02013;C</xref>).

Another set of TFs expressed in RPC subsets is the Tcfs that are downstream of the Wnt signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001588-g007">Figure 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001588-g010">10D&#x02013;I</xref>). <italic>Tcf3</italic> was present in more RPC profiles from early timepoints, while <italic>Tcf7l2</italic> was detected more in P0 RPCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001588-g007">Figure 7</xref>). The possible significance of this early/late expression difference is unclear. Also, the function of these TFs in retinal development remains elusive since the Wnt factors themselves were not strongly detected in the retina (data not shown and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001588-Blackshaw1">&#x0005b;27&#x0005d;</xref>) and Wnt inhibitors such as <italic>Sfrp2</italic> were found, at least in the early retina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001588-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Finally, some uncharacterized TFs were also identified as expressed in RPCs. One of these factors, <italic>Tcf19</italic> was found in a small subset of RPCs at E12.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001588-g007">Figure 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001588-g010">10J</xref>) and then an increasing subset at subsequent stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001588-g007">Figure 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001588-g010">10K&#x02013;L</xref>). At P0, <italic>Tcf19</italic> transcripts were localized near the vitreal edge of the ONBL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001588-g010">Figure 10J</xref>), suggesting this gene may be cell cycle regulated (see below). In total, many different classes of TFs were found expressed in subsets of RPCs throughout retinal development. The challenge in the future will be to use these single cell data in concert with functional studies to understand the precise combinations of TFs that RPCs use to generate all the distinct subtypes of retinal neurons.</p><fig id="pone-0001588-g010" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0001588.g010</object-id><label>Figure 10</label><caption><title>TF expression in RPCs.</title><p>ISH on retinal cryosections was performed at three stages: E12.5 (A, D, G, J, M), E16.5 (B, E, H, K, N) and P0 (C, F, I, L, O).

ISH on retinal cryosections confirmed that these genes were expressed in the ONBL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001588-g011">Figure 11B&#x02013;G</xref> and data not shown). In the developing retina, the movement of RPCs is coordinated with the cell cycle so that mitosis occurs at the most scleral edge of the retina, just adjacent to the RPE, and S phase occurs toward the vitreal side of the ONBL <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001588-Sidman1">&#x0005b;16&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001588-Dyer2">&#x0005b;112&#x0005d;</xref>.

At E12.5, the expression pattern of these genes was more scattered throughout the ONBL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001588-g011">Figure 11B, E</xref>) likely reflecting the observation that the precise migration patterns of RPCs with respect to the cell cycle do not occur at this early stage (Trimarchi and Cepko, unpublished observations) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001588-Le1">&#x0005b;78&#x0005d;</xref>.

ISH on retinal cryosections revealed an expression pattern in a scattered subset of ONBL cells at E12.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001588-g011">Figure 11H</xref>) that progressed to a staining pattern that was concentrated on the vitreal side of the ONBL where the S phase cells reside at P0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001588-g011">Figure 11J</xref>).

Many RPCs showed robust expression of markers for both G1/S and G2/M (note E12 cell A4, E13 cell B3 and P0 cell F3 as examples in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001588-g011">Figure 11A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001588-g012">Figure 12A</xref>). These results may point to a tighter transcriptional regulation of genes that play a role in G2/M than those genes involved in the G1 and S phases.

At all timepoints, though, the expression did appear to be enriched toward the scleral side of the ONBL, where mitosis occurs, but it was never absent from the vitreal side, indicating the possibility of broader expression.

However, the overall percentage of cells expressing <italic>Cdc20</italic> was always much lower than those expressing a G1/S marker such as <italic>Rrm2</italic> (10&#x00025; for <italic>Cdc20</italic> versus 30&#x00025; for <italic>Rrm2</italic> at P0, based upon DISH). <italic>Cyclin B1</italic> and <italic>Cyclin B2</italic> showed a similar expression pattern to that of <italic>Cdc20</italic>, with the exception of being more biased toward the scleral edge of the retina, especially at earlier stages such as E12.5 and E16.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001588-g012">Figure 12E&#x02013;G</xref> and data not shown). Ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of many substrates is important for driving cells through anaphase and allowing the completion of mitosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001588-Reddy1">&#x0005b;122&#x0005d;</xref>. One enzyme that participates in the ubiquitination is Ube2c and this gene also was found strongly associated with other characterized G2/M markers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001588.s013">Table S9</xref>). Section ISH revealed that <italic>Ube2c</italic> was in a subset of cells in the ONBL at all three stages examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001588-g012">Figure 12H&#x02013;J</xref>) and also displayed a pattern of radial stripes reminiscent to <italic>Cdc20</italic> at E16.5 (Compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001588-g012">Figure 12C with 12I</xref>).

This may indicate that even some of the G2/M class of genes is less tightly regulated in the developing retina than previously appreciated, and/or that there is differential regulation of the RNA and the protein. Finally, the cyclin dependent kinase inhibitor <italic>P27Kip1</italic> was also found strongly associated with G2/M marker genes by hierarchical clustering (data not shown).

Since the G2/M phases of the cell cycle would most likely be when this link would occur, it was of interest to identify those RPCs with the most characteristic gene expression of G2/M. The classification scheme described above for the identification of cell types was adopted to generate G2/M scores for the RPCs, transitional cells and postmitotic neurons. These scores were a composite based upon the clusters of genes generated around three G2/M markers, <italic>Cdc20</italic>, <italic>Aurora kinase B</italic> (<italic>AurkB</italic>), and <italic>Ube2c</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001588.s013">Table S9</xref>). Fourteen of the 42 RPCs displayed high scores for G2/M while none of the postmitotic neurons scored highly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001588-g013">Figure 13</xref>). Only 2/6 of the RPCs denoted as transitional cells scored highly for G2/M markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001588-g013">Figure 13</xref>), suggesting that these cells are most likely in different windows of the transition from RPC to postmitotic neuron. Examination of the RPCs with high G2/M gene expression was performed with the hopes of identifying novel genes involved in the process of exiting from the cell cycle. Both hierarchical and Fisher's exact test based clustering methods yielded many significantly associated genes, but given the nature of these genes (many kinesins and microtubule associated proteins), the majority of them probably play generic roles in cytokinesis and other mitotic processes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0001588.s013">Table S9</xref> and data not shown). Visual inspection of the single cell profiles in Microsoft Excel, with an extra focus on the cells receiving the highest G2/M scores, revealed several interesting candidate genes that may play a role in the ability of an RPC to exit from the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001588-g014">Figure 14A</xref>).

This result is consistent with <italic>Btg2</italic> playing a role in cell cycle exit since many more retinal neurons are being generated at P0 than at E12.5.

Section ISH for both genes confirmed that their expression increased as the number of retinal neurons generated increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0001588-g014">Figure 14H&#x02013;M</xref>). Neither gene has been extensively characterized in general, nor does any information exist as to the possible functions of these genes during retinal development. Drosophila homologues of <italic>Rhbdl3</italic> have been shown to modulate both the EGF pathway and the notch pathway and, in that manner, play specific roles in the cell fate specification of neuroblasts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001588-Bier1">&#x0005b;126&#x0005d;</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001588-Jaszai1">&#x0005b;127&#x0005d;</xref>.

Given that both of these genes have been shown to be possible regulators of important pathways that are also at work in the developing retina, they make excellent candidates for regulators of the cell cycle exit and cell fate decision-making processes of RPCs.

The degree to which single RPCs varied in their gene expression was not previously appreciated using profiling methods that employed sampling of the entire retina, which contains multiple different cell types, even at a single timepoint. One striking aspect of the observed RPC heterogeneity was the significant contribution that TFs made to the gene expression differences. Many different TF families were represented by a large number of distinct family members in individual RPCs. In addition, cell cycle markers, especially those that play a role in the G2/M phases of the cell cycle, were observed in only a subset of RPCs. Although there was no readily apparent link between the heterogeneous expression of TFs and different cell cycle markers, genes potentially involved in cell cycle exit were found in G2/M RPCs. The heterogeneity of RPC expression of these genes points to the intriguing possibility that different RPCs may use distinct mechanisms for exiting from the cell cycle. Future studies will be required to address whether these distinct mechanisms can be linked to specific cell fates.</p><p>As more studies on the gene expression of single cells appear, the one commonality that is shared by all of them is the discovery of a greater degree of gene expression heterogeneity than had been previously believed to exist. This finding has held true for multiple experimental systems ranging from simple populations of engineered <italic>Escherichia coli</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001588-Elowitz1">&#x0005b;129&#x0005d;</xref>, to a cell line treated with retinoic acid <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001588-Huang2">&#x0005b;130&#x0005d;</xref> and even to individual hematopoietic stem cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001588-Ramos1">&#x0005b;10&#x0005d;</xref>. The data presented here demonstrate for the first time the enormous heterogeneity of gene expression in progenitor cells as a tissue develops. The functional consequences of these gene expression differences will not be fully understood without more experimentation, but several models are conceivable. It may be that the heterogeneity of gene expression is rendering certain subsets of RPCs competent to respond to particular environmental cues and this would bias these cells toward producing specific cell fates. Alternatively, the differences might not be played out in differential responses to environmental cues, but might reflect intrinsic differences that drive cell fate decisions, and/or cell cycle decisions, relatively independent of the environment. A contrasting model would be that the fluctuations in gene expression, which could be stochastic and/or regulated, might not be meaningful in terms of progenitor behavior. . This latter model would make RPCs similar to HL-60 cells that are initially quite different in their responses to retinoic acid, but eventually reach the same final cellular destination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pone.0001588-Huang2">&#x0005b;130&#x0005d;</xref>.
