The highly resolved sea urchin pregastrular endomesoderm&#x02013;gene regulatory network (EM-GRN) provides a unique framework to study the global regulatory interactions underlying endomesoderm induction. Vegetal micromeres of the sea urchin embryo constitute a classic endomesoderm signaling center, whose potential to induce archenteron formation from presumptive ectoderm was demonstrated almost a century ago. In this work, we ectopically activate the primary mesenchyme cell&#x02013;GRN (PMC-GRN) that operates in micromere progeny by misexpressing the micromere determinant Pmar1 and identify the responding EM-GRN that is induced in animal blastomeres. Using localized loss-of -function analyses in conjunction with expression of <italic>endo16</italic>, the molecular definition of micromere-dependent endomesoderm specification, we show that the TGF&#x003b2; cytokine, ActivinB, is an essential component of this induction in blastomeres that emit this signal, as well as in cells that respond to it. We report that normal pregastrular endomesoderm specification requires activation of the Pmar1-inducible subset of the EM-GRN by the same cytokine, strongly suggesting that early micromere-mediated endomesoderm specification, which regulates timely gastrulation in the sea urchin embryo, is also ActivinB dependent. This study unexpectedly uncovers the existence of an additional uncharacterized micromere signal to endomesoderm progenitors, significantly revising existing models. In one of the first network-level characterizations of an intercellular inductive phenomenon, we describe an important in vivo model of the requirement of ActivinB signaling in the earliest steps of embryonic endomesoderm progenitor specification.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>In recent years, &#x0201c;gene regulatory networks&#x0201d; (GRNs) have provided integrated views of gene interactions that control biological processes. One of the earliest networks to be activated in the developing zygotes is the one controlling endomesoderm development. In the sea urchin, this network includes several subnetworks that function in adjacent tiers of cells that form the endoderm and mesoderm of the developing embryo. Although classic embryological manipulations have shown that the precursors of the embryonic skeleton induce endomesoderm fate in adjacent cells, the GRNs regulating this interaction are not understood. To investigate these networks, we ectopically activated a GRN that operates in skeletogenic precursors and characterized the responding GRN in neighboring cells, which adopt an endomesoderm fate. By testing the responsiveness of every core factor in the responding GRN, which allowed us to identify a subset that executes the response to the induction, we demonstrated that the signaling molecule, ActivinB, is an essential component of this induction and that its function is physiologically relevant: it is required during normal embryonic development to activate the same GRN that responds to signals from skeletogenic precursors. Furthermore, the network response to ActivinB signaling reveals greater complexity in an additional uncharacterized inductive signal emitted by skeletogenic precursors. Our results thus highlight how interacting GRNs can be used to understand a fundamental signaling process.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="toc"><p>A classic embryonic induction in sea urchins is described in terms of interacting gene regulatory networks and a signal transduction system that connects them.</p></abstract><counts><page-count count="17"/></counts><custom-meta-wrap><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Sethi AJ, Angerer RC, Angerer LM (2009) Gene regulatory network interactions in sea urchin endomesoderm induction.

Understanding the mechanisms of embryonic induction is also of vital clinical importance, especially in the field of regenerative medicine, in which pluripotent stem cells are induced to differentiate into specific lineages of therapeutic interest.

Our studies define a subset of the E-EM/En-GRN that responds to signals from the Pmar1-activated PMC-GRN and show that a significant fraction of the E-EM/En-GRN, including the recently identified Wnt8/Blimp1/&#x003b2;-catenin subcircuit &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000029-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d;, is insensitive to signals emitted by Pmar1-misexpressing blastomeres.

Furthermore, we demonstrate that ActivinB function is necessary for activation of the Pmar1-inducible subset of the E-EM/En-GRN in early endogenous endomesoderm development, whereas the Pmar1-unresponsive portion of the E-EM/En-GRN operates in vegetal endomesoderm precursors independently of ActivinB signaling. These key findings strongly suggest that ActivinB has an essential role in endomesoderm specification mediated by micromeres and their progeny and unexpectedly reveal the existence of a new micromere-derived signal(s).

We ectopically activated the Pmar1-dependent PMC-GRN in nonvegetal cells and demonstrate that adjacent blastomeres are specified as endomesoderm through a responding GRN that includes genes encoding the core factors Z13, Eve, and FoxA. In contrast, a significant part of the sea urchin EM-GRN, consisting of the regulatory outputs of Wnt8, Blimp1, and Brachyury, is not activated through Pmar1-mediated signals.

The requirement for ActivinB in Pmar1-dependent endomesoderm induction strongly suggests that it plays a similar essential role in endomesoderm formation in response to signals from ectopic micromeres, a phenomenon first described almost 70 y ago in the sea urchin embryo &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000029-b016">16</xref>&#x0005d;. ActivinB signaling through ALK4/5/7 during early cleavage and blastula stages also is necessary for endogenous vegetal activation of almost the entire E-EM/En-GRN induced by ectopic Pmar1 expression. This critical finding, along with the fact that, like micromere progeny, ActivinB is required for normal <italic>endo16</italic> expression in veg2 endomesoderm progenitors, and for timely gastrulation, strongly suggests that this TGF&#x003b2; ligand plays an essential role in early micromere-dependent endomesoderm specification.</p><p>In contrast to the Pmar1-dependent EM-GRN factors, ActivinB is not required for normal vegetal expression of any of the Pmar1-insensitive EM-GRN core factors. Furthermore, both the Delta-dependent secondary mesoderm&#x02013;GRN and the late endoderm-GRN (17 to 30 h p.f.) that is subsequently activated in veg2 and veg1 macromere progeny are independent of ActivinB function. Thus, the primary cellular targets of ActivinB signaling during pregastrular endomesoderm development are the more vegetal (veg2) macromere derivatives. The exact state of specification of these cells in ActivinB morphants is not clear, but some of them transfate to pigment cells, presumably as a result of reduced FoxA activity &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000029-b029">29</xref>&#x0005d;.

Alternatively, if veg2 endoderm progenitors in ActivinB morphants do not acquire other secondary mesoderm fates, then they probably participate in gut formation. In this case, either they eventually express all of the core EM-GRN factors through micromere-independent mechanisms or, in a later vegetal developmental context, the Wnt8/Blimp1/nuclear &#x003b2;-catenin subcircuit &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000029-b023">23</xref>&#x0005d; is sufficient to support this process. Either scenario would require considerable regulatory cross talk between GRN components in order to achieve threshold concentrations of critical core factors that drive definitive endoderm development.</p><p>Recent models of pregastrular development in echinoderm embryos have proposed that a single micromere signal specifies veg2 macromere progeny as <italic>endo16</italic>-expressing endomesoderm progenitors and also causes the gradual clearance of the &#x003b2;-catenin antagonist, SoxB1, from nuclei of these blastomeres &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000029-b021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000029-b027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000029-b040">40</xref>&#x0005d;. This is an attractive model because it invokes a causal linkage between activation and maintenance of the EM-GRN that depends on nuclear &#x003b2;-catenin accumulation and removal of an antagonist. However, the results of several experiments presented here argue strongly that micromere-mediated early endomesoderm induction and micromere-regulated SoxB1 removal are independent processes. First, SoxB1 down-regulation occurs normally in embryos lacking the early endomesoderm-inducing (<italic>endo16</italic>-inducing) signal ActivinB. Second, SoxB1 clearance is not required for activation of the early EM-GRN because macromere progeny express early Pmar1-responsive core factors in this subnetwork before SoxB1 protein levels are detectably reduced in nuclei of the same cells.

Identifying this signal and its GRN properties will be necessary to achieve a comprehensive understanding of pregastrular development in echinoderm embryos. We show that endomesoderm is ectopically induced through the regulatory outputs of a set of Pmar1-responsive EM-GRN core factors, making it important to understand how this core set activates and stabilizes downstream GRN circuits. Since this Pmar1-responsive GRN potentially drives formation of a complete archenteron without detectable nuclear &#x003b2;-catenin, it is also conceivable that additional uncharacterized &#x003b2;-catenin&#x02013;independent GRNs exist.

After posthybridization washes, embryos were incubated for 1 h at RT in a blocking buffer consisting of 10&#x00025; normal goat serum and 5 mg BSA/ml in MOPS wash buffer &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000029-b053">53</xref>&#x0005d;, followed by 30 min at RT in horseradish peroxidase (POD)-conjugated anti-digoxigenin antibody (Roche) (1:1,500) in blocking buffer. Embryos were washed eight times over the course of 2 h at RT with MOPS wash buffer. Hybrids were detected with a 1:100 dilution of TSA-stock solution (FITC TSA-Plus kit or Cy3-TSA Plus kit; PerkinElmer) in diluting buffer at RT for 6&#x02013;8 min, followed by five washes in MOPS wash buffer at RT.</p><p>For dual-color FISH with fluorescein- and digoxigenin-conjugated RNA probes, after the blocking step, embryos were incubated in POD-conjugated anti-fluorescein antibody (Roche) (1:750) at RT overnight, followed by eight washes with MOPS wash buffer. Duplexes were detected by incubating embryos in Cy3 TSA (1:100 dilution) for 6&#x02013;8 min, followed by five washes with MOPS wash buffer. The POD activity of the bound anti-fluorescein antibody was quenched with 0.1&#x00025; (w/v) sodium azide in MOPS wash buffer for 30 min at RT, followed by six washes with MOPS wash buffer for a total of 60 min. Digoxigenin-labeled transcripts were detected subsequently using FITC-TSA as described above.</p><p>The dual-labeled FISH procedure was modified to allow hybridization of probes to endogenous transcripts and mRNA synthesized from injected <italic>SpHE</italic> promoter-containing plasmids but to exclude formation of hybrids with plasmid DNA &#x0005b;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000029-b054">54</xref>&#x0005d;. To prevent DNA denaturation during hybridization, the formamide concentration was reduced to 50&#x00025; and the hybridization temperature lowered to 45 &#x000b0;C.

After five washes for a total of 1 h at RT with PBST wash buffer (1&#x000d7; PBS, 0.05&#x00025; Tween-20), bound primary antibody was detected with goat anti-rabbit Alexa-488 secondary antibody (1:750; Invitrogen) in PBST blocking buffer for 1 h at RT.</p></sec><sec id="s4f"><title>Image processing.</title><p>Images were captured on a Zeiss Axiovert200 inverted microscope equipped with an Axiotome axial tomography device and differential interference contrast (DIC) optics in Axiovision Release 4.6.
